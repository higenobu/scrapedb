5/18/2022,"The EU plans a “massive” increase in solar and wind power, and a short-term boost for coal, to rid itself of its reliance on Russian oil and gas as fast as possible. In a plan outlined on Wednesday, the European Commission said the EU needed to find an extra €210bn (£178bn) over the next five years to pay for phasing out Russian fossil fuels and speeding up the switch to green energy. Senior officials conceded that in the short term, the race to get off Russian gas would mean burning more coal and nuclear energy. The plan, drawn up in response to the Kremlin-ordered invasion of Ukraine and subsequent soul searching about Europe’s dependence on Russian gas, proposes upgrades to the EU green deal, the bloc’s flagship policy to confront the climate crisis. The Commission proposed that 45% of the EU’s energy mix should come from renewables by 2030, an advance on the current 40% target suggested less than a year ago. Officials also want to cut energy consumption by 13% by 2030 (compared to 2020), in comparison with the current proposal of a 9% saving. “It is clear we need to put an end to this dependence and a lot faster before we had foreseen before this war,” said Frans Timmermans, the EU official in charge of the green deal. Contrasting the call to find €210bn to spend on new energy infrastructure, including windfarms and solar panels, he said the EU was spending €100bn a year on Russian fossil fuels. “Speeding up the transition meant that money can stay in Europe, can help bring down the energy bills of European families and will not be used to finance this barbaric war in Ukraine.” But phasing out Russian gas means coal-fired power plants “might also be used longer than initially expected”, states the EU strategy. The decision to quit Russian gas has also led to a scramble to increase Europe’s imports of liquified natural gas from countries such as the US and Qatar, as well as pipeline gas from Azerbaijan. The Commission said it would be necessary to spend up to €12bn – about 6% of the extra €210bn needed – to build LNG terminals and upgrade oil plants to allow EU member states to switch to non-Russian fossil fuels. Timmermans insisted the EU could still meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050. “You might use coal a bit longer, that has a negative impact on your emissions,” adding: “If we can actually do what I say, reduce our energy consumption in combination with a speedier introduction of renewables, we will bring down our emissions even quicker than before.” Dutch MEP Bas Eickhout, a vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, said the Commission was leaving the door open for member states to continue funding fossil fuel infrastructure. “Investments that are urgently needed for energy efficiency and renewables can still flow into new pipelines and terminals, this might continue our fossil energy dependency,” he said. Green campaigners voiced concern about plans to source LNG from states in the Middle East and Caucasus with poor human rights records, while criticising the green light for new gas infrastructure. “The more we spend importing gas, the more we continue to expose the most vulnerable in our society to unaffordable energy bills, fuel the climate crisis and fund other repressive fossil-fuelled regimes around the world,” said Murray Worthy at Global Witness. To help speed up renewable energy, the EU wants to make it easier for companies to build wind and solar farms. Officials said it can take up to nine years to get a permit for a windfarm and four for solar. “And this is time we do not have,” said one. Any change in planning laws would require action from national and local authorities.",News/Environment,EU plans ‘massive’ increase in green energy to rid itself of reliance on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/18/eu-plans-massive-increase-in-green-energy-to-rid-itself-of-reliance-on-russia
5/18/2022,"An NHS trust has admitted breaking the law by failing to provide safe care in two cases where patients died after serious mistakes were made by hospital staff. The Shrewsbury and Telford trust pleaded guilty on Wednesday at Telford magistrates court to three criminal charges brought by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the NHS care regulator in England. The charges related to the deaths of 31-year-old Mohammed Ismael Zaman in October 2019 and Max Dingle, who was in his 80s when he died in May 2020. The CQC mounted the prosecution because both men had been exposed to avoidable harm as a result of serious safety failings at the hospital, in breach of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, which are intend to guarantee safe, high-quality care. Zaman, a trainee pharmacist, died of severe blood loss while undergoing kidney dialysis. His dialysis machine had set off a venous pressure alarm when his catheter became disconnected. However, the member of staff who reset the alarm did not check if the catheter was connected. Zaman lost three pints of blood in seven minutes, was found in a pool of blood and died, despite attempts to revive him. The CQC’s lawyer Ryan Donoghue told the court that Dingle’s “head was trapped between the bed rails and mattress” after he was admitted with chronic lung disease. Although the alarm was immediately raised when he was found, and he was freed, he died from a cardiac arrest. Referring to Dingle’s death, Donoghue said: “The basis [of the trust’s guilty plea] is that the failures exposed him to a significant risk of avoidable harm.” Phil Dingle, the son of Max Dingle, said: “It is sad to lose a father at any stage in life, but more so in such tragic and preventable circumstances. “With many still unanswered questions, I find it incomprehensible that a hospital trust is allowed to ‘self police’ a serious and unexpected incident which is highlighted as a known risk by the Health and Safety Executive. Furthermore, an independent Home Office Coroner should be appointed in such circumstances to ensure transparency of process with the postmortem.” The trust will be sentenced later on Wednesday. Peter Walsh, the chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, highlighted that the trust was previously prosecuted in 2016 by the HSE over unsafe care and patient deaths. “The police are reportedly looking at hundreds of maternity cases which may lead to prosecutions. One has to ask whether the system for regulating the trust and holding it to account for such serious and repeated failures is working. Fines are clearly not enough,” Walsh said.",News/Society,NHS trust pleads guilty over deaths of two patients after staff mistakes,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/nhs-trust-pleads-guilty-over-death-of-two-patients-after-staff-mistakes-shrewsbury-telford
5/18/2022,"The US men’s and women’s soccer teams will share prize money from their respective World Cups equally in a historic agreement announced on Wednesday. US Soccer and the unions for the two teams reached the deal during negotiations for their new collective bargaining agreements, which have now been ratified. “The accomplishments in this CBA are a testament to the incredible efforts of WNT players on and off the field,” said USWNT player and USWNT players’ association president Becky Sauerbrunn. “The gains we have been able to achieve are both because of the strong foundation laid by the generations of WNT players that came before the current team and through our union’s recent collaboration with our counterparts at the [men’s players union] and leadership at US Soccer. We hope that this agreement and its historic achievements in not only providing for equal pay but also in improving the training and playing environment for national team players will similarly serve as the foundation for continued growth of women’s soccer both in the United States and abroad.” USMNT defender Walker Zimmerman, who is a member of the men’s union leadership group, also welcomed the deal. “There are tough conversations, but at the end of the day, it is the right thing to do,” Zimmerman said. “It’s something that [the US women’s team players] deserve. It’s something that they have fought for so hard, and, to be honest, sometimes it does feel like we had just kind of come alongside of them and had been a little late.” Fifa’s prize money for the men’s and women’s World Cups is unequal. The bonus pool for this year’s men’s World Cup in Qatar is $400m, while the prize money for the women’s tournament in Australia in 2023 is $60m. Under the new agreement, the unions for the US men’s and women’s teams will share the prize money from the 2022 and 2023 World Cups. The US men have already qualified for Qatar 2022, while the women’s team are the reigning women’s champions and are heavy favourites to book their place for Australia 2023 later this summer. World Cup prize money was not the only area where equal deals were reached. Shares of ticket sales will now be equal, as will win bonuses. Some aspects of income and benefits will differ between the teams. The men will not share their $2.5m bonus for qualifying for this year’s World Cup as it was part of the their previous CBA. USWNT players will receive benefits relating to childcare and parental leave that will not apply to their male counterparts. “This is a truly historic moment. These agreements have changed the game forever here in the United States and have the potential to change the game around the world,” said US Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone, who is also a former USWNT player. “US Soccer and the USWNT and USMNT players have reset their relationship with these new agreements and are leading us forward to an incredibly exciting new phase of mutual growth and collaboration as we continue our mission to become the preeminent sport in the United States.” The US women’s team has long fought for equal treatment with the men’s team. In December 2020 they reached an agreement with US Soccer over equal work conditions with their male counterparts. The players were granted the same conditions as the US men’s team in areas such as travel, hotel accommodation, the right to play on grass rather than artificial turf, and staffing. Then, in February, the team agreed a $24m settlement that ended a six-year legal battle over equal pay.",Sport/Football,US women’s and men’s teams agree equal share of World Cup prize money,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/us-womens-and-mens-teams-agree-equal-share-of-world-cup-prize-money
5/18/2022,"Conservative whips have remonstrated with the Tory MP Michael Fabricant over a tweet in which he appeared to make light of the arrest of a colleague, over allegations of rape and sexual assault. It emerged on Tuesday that an unnamed Conservative MP had been arrested on suspicion of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office. The MP in question, a man in his 50s, has been asked by Conservative whips, who deal with party discipline, not to attend the House of Commons while he remains under investigation. Fabricant, the MP for Lichfield, tweeted that he was expecting a good turnout at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, not just to back Boris Johnson, but “also to prove they are NOT the one told by the chief whip to stay at home. I’ll be there!” with a winking face emoji. I am expecting a strong turnout of Conservative MPs at Prime Minister's Questions today.Not only to demonstrate their strong support for #Boris (!!). BUT also to prove they are NOT the one told by the Chief Whip to stay at home. I'll be there!😜https://t.co/PNxoXWBy9v Colleagues including the Labour MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the Commons standards committee, urged Fabricant to take the tweet down. “It shows callous disregard for the alleged victims, and it implies rape and sexual assault are a laughing matter,” he said. Sources in the Conservative whips office indicated that Fabricant had been spoken to by whips about the tweet, which they suggested was inappropriate. Fabricant later tweeted: “No one is making light of rape or assault. Far from it. But those who want to read something into a comment will contrive to do so whatever. They are professional offence takers.” His original message remained online. The arrest of the Conservative MP followed a two-year investigation, Metropolitan police said, and related to offences alleged to have been committed between 2002 and 2009. The MP was released on bail on Thursday morning. The arrest came as the date was set for two byelections triggered by the resignation of Conservative MPs. Imran Ahmad Khan, the former MP for Wakefield, was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy; while the former Tiverton MP Neil Parish admitted watching pornography in the House of Commons chamber. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, kicked off prime minister’s questions by warning MPs not to name the individual in question.",News/Politics,Michael Fabricant berated over tweet appearing to joke about Tory MP rape arrest,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/michael-fabricant-berated-over-tweet-appearing-to-joke-about-tory-mp-arrest
5/18/2022,"Nearly 2.8 million people in the UK live more than 10 minutes walk from a public park, garden or playing field, according to research. Fields in Trust, which protects and campaigns for public green spaces, found just four out of the 11 regions in Great Britain met its “six-acre standard” for green space provision. Three-quarters of local authorities had adopted the charity recommendations, or equivalent guidance, in 2014. But according to research published on Wednesday, only Scotland, Wales, and the south-east and east of England met it. Yet none of these regions were in the top five for accessibility of green space. Overall, 2,779,065 people in Britain, about one in 24 people, lived more than 10 minutes from the nearest park. The worst region for accessibility to green space was Wales, where one in 13 people lived more than 10 minutes from a park or public garden. The findings come from Fields in Trust’s green spaces index, published every year since 2019. The charity’s guidance for outdoor sport and play, first published in the 1930s, recommends a minimum of 6 acres (2.4 hectares) of accessible green space – such as parks, public gardens, nature reserves and playing fields – per 1,000 people. A spokesperson for the charity said it only published data for broad regions to avoid setting up a “league table” that would unfairly single out certain areas. But cross-referencing findings with those areas prioritised for the government’s levelling up agenda showed they had on average 10% less green space than the standard, the charity said. The index exposed large disparities between regions. People in Scotland, the best-served part of Britain, had 41 sq metres of public green space per person, more than double the 19 sq metres available to Londoners. However, even those living in regions with more green space could find those areas comparatively more inaccessible. The figures showed about one in 17 people in Scotland lived more than 10 minutes walk from their nearest green space, compared to almost as few as one in 1,000 in London. There were no publicly available maps or datasets of green space in Northern Ireland. The Labour MP Clive Betts, the chair of the levelling up, housing and communities scrutiny committee, described the findings as timely. “I think, particularly during the lockdown, the importance of green space and accessible green space near to people’s homes was highlighted as never before,” Betts said. The government ought to encourage local authorities to engage with Fields in Trust, which buys up green spaces to hold them in trust for the people in perpetuity, Betts said. “And the government probably ought to think about the issue of funding for open space in general,” he added. “We did a report as a select committee on parks and open spaces about five years ago now. I think we are going to have to revisit that as a committee at some point, because there were generally lots of good words issued after it [but] probably not a lot of progress made since.”",News/Cities,"Green spaces are not accessible for 2.8m people in UK, finds study",https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2022/may/18/green-spaces-are-not-accessible-for-28m-people-in-uk-finds-study
5/18/2022,"Russia says another 694 Ukrainian troops have surrendered at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steel plant in the past day, bringing the total number close to 1,000. The Russian defence ministry said 29 of the soldiers were wounded. It did not say where the soldiers would be sent, though on Tuesday evening Reuters reported that seven buses carrying Ukrainian soldiers left the plant for a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka in a Russian-controlled area of Donetsk region. Ukraine has not commented on Russia’s latest update. In his address to the nation late on Tuesday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said an “evacuation mission” was continuing with help from “the most influential international mediators”. The fate of the soldiers leaving the plant remains unclear, and it is also not clear how many remain inside. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, said on Wednesday that the “commanders of the highest level” were still hiding in the plant. Earlier, Ukrainian officials had said some of its soldiers remained. The two sides in the war have released practically no details of the agreement that led to the surrender of the troops, who were holed up for weeks in an extensive network of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said on Tuesday the soldiers would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but a number of Russian officials on Wednesday repeated statements made a day earlier by other hardliners that the soldiers should be tried. Pushilin on Wednesday called on an “international tribunal” to be set to decide the soldiers’ “fate”. “As for war criminals as well as those who are nationalists, their fate, if they laid down their arms, should be decided by the courts,” he said. “If the enemy has laid down arms, then his fate will be decided by the courts. If it is a Nazi criminal, then it’s a tribunal.” The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, whose forces have participated in the battle for Mariupol, said the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks, should not be exchanged and “must be punished by law”. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. The Russian Duma is expected to discuss the subject on Wednesday and potentially accept a new resolution that would ban prisoner exchanges of Azov fighters. Next week, Russia’s supreme court will also hear an application to designate Ukraine’s Azov regiment as a “terrorist organisation”, opening the way for sentences of up to 20 years for those convicted of involvement. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which exists to examine major crimes, has already announced plans to interrogate the surrendered soldiers, without indicating whether they would be treated as suspects. The fate of the forces taken prisoner at Azovstal could further complicate efforts to resume peace negotiations, with both sides blaming each other for a breakdown in talks. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Ukraine of a “total lack of desire” to continue the negotiations, while the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said talks were on hold . The Azov movement has been used as a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative to justify the war in Ukraine, and Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center said Russian politicians were using their surrender “to promote themselves and show their loyalty to the Kremlin”. “But ultimately, their statements don’t matter much and it will be Putin who decides what happens to the Ukrainian soldiers,” Kolesnikov added. He said what Putin chose to do with the Azovstal soldiers could point to his current intentions in the conflict. “If he decides to try the soldiers, it will be a clear, worrying sign that he is willing to further escalate the situation. It will be a spit in Zelenskiy’s face.” Alternatively, Kolesnikov said, trading soldiers with Ukraine would be framed domestically as a Russian “act of mercy and compassion” despite the current calls by Putin’s hardliners demanding severe punishment for the soldiers. “At home, Putin has flexibility and could play both cards,” Kolesnikov said.",News/World news,"Hundreds more Ukrainians surrender at Mariupol steel plant, Russia claims",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/ukraine-mariupol-azovstal-soldiers-russia
5/18/2022,"A Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead a civilian on a bicycle, in Ukraine’s first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, sat emotionless as prosecutors detailed charges that he had fired his AK-47 at a 62 year-old man from the window of a car in the north-eastern Sumy region in late February. His commander allegedly told him to kill the man, an unarmed civilian, because he worried the victim might give away the position of Russian forces. The court, presided over by three judges, will still hear testimony from witnesses including the victim’s wife and another Russian soldier who was in the car with Shysimarin, before confirming the verdict and handing down a sentence. Prosecutors have moved fast. It is extremely unusual to hold a trial while a conflict is still ongoing, and unprecedented to do it within weeks. The victim was shot dead less than three months ago, in the first days after the invasion. Ukrainian authorities say justice for atrocities committed by Russian forces is a priority, with investigators at times even risking their lives in areas still laced with mines or threatened by Russian forces to collect evidence that could help secure convictions. They have the support of several teams of international investigators and forensic experts, but face a mammoth task. Hundreds of civilians were killed just in the parts of Ukraine that have been liberated from Russian forces, and dozens of rapes have been reported. Already Ukraine’s prosector general has registered more than 11,000 war crimes, which have included attacks on hospitals. Large swathes of Ukrainian territory are still under Russian control, so the toll is expected to rise considerably if those areas can be reached. Shysimarin, who comes from Ust Illyinsk in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia, was a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division at the time of the killing, which happened on 28 February in Chupakhivka village. Prosecutors say he shot at a car after his convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces, then stole the car and drove it away with four other soldiers. He then used an AK-47 to shoot the unarmed man, just a few dozen metres from his home. The man was speaking on his phone and Shysimarin was ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. One of the few precedents for holding a trial while a war is still raging comes from the Balkans. A Bosnian Serb soldier, Borislav Herak, was captured by Bosnian army soldiers, put on trial for 35 killings and 14 rapes, and convicted of genocide and crimes against civilians. Senad Kreho, who was president of a district military tribunal in Sarajevo in 1993, said the legal system functioned fairly even though the war was still ongoing. “Numerous subsequent reviews of [Herak’s] case by international and national legal experts found that he was given a fair trial,” Kreho told the Associated Press. Two further unnamed soldiers are expected to have a first hearing within days on allegations they used a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher to shell homes and civilian buildings in Kharkiv district. Another case will be heard in absentia shortly. A soldier named as Mikhail Romanov is accused of rape and murder.

5/18/2022,"One of the most popular and admired mezzo-sopranos of the modern era, Teresa Berganza, who has died aged 89, was once described by the conductor Herbert von Karajan as “the Carmen of the century”. With a voice that married lustrous tone to formidable technical artistry and a captivating stage presence, she excelled in a relatively narrow repertoire judiciously developed to harness her talents. Having mastered the skills required for coloratura roles, not least in the operas of Rossini, she progressed, by her own account, to Mozart for “his style, his soul”. As she once said, “Mozart is my Messiah. Just call me a mystic, I don’t mind. My name is Teresa for a reason.” Only then did she finally accede to the many requests to undertake the role of Carmen, to which she brought both a vocal and theatrical vibrancy and a remarkably individual conception. She attributed her technical security to her studies in Madrid with Lola Rodríguez Aragón, a pupil of Elisabeth Schumann, graduating from the conservatory there with the top prize for singers. Having made her debut as Dorabella (Così Fan Tutte) at Aix-en-Provence in 1957, she returned as Rosina (Il Barbiere di Siviglia), Purcell’s Dido, Cherubino (Le Nozze di Figaro), Octavia (L’incoronazione di Poppea) and Ruggiero (Handel’s Alcina). The following year she sang Isolier in Le Comte Ory at the Piccolo Scala and Cherubino at Glyndebourne. Her Covent Garden debut in 1960 was as Rosina, and she returned to sing Cherubino and the title role in Rossini’s La Cenerentola. Her debut at the Met in 1967 was as Cherubino. She sang roles in operas by Mozart, Cherubini and Cesti at Vienna, Paris, Salzburg and elsewhere. The somewhat classical restraint that habitually marked her performances may have been a product of a puritanical upbringing: in adolescence she considered becoming a nun. Certainly there was a precision and focus in her delivery that, while enabling her to dispatch coloratura embellishment with facility, could make her performances slow to catch fire. Yet there would be flashes of brilliance – a dazzlingly executed turn of phrase, a thrilling climactic top note – that would light up the stage. An appealing stage presence contributed to the allure she radiated. As well as first wishing to master the demands of Rossini and Mozart, doubtless her religious scruples played a part in eschewing offers to take on the role of Carmen. When Peter Diamand of the Edinburgh festival finally managed to persuade her to undertake it in 1977, it was on the condition that the production should, as she put it in her autobiography, “eradicate the distorted image of Carmen that has always been presented to the public”. Speaking to women “living in the caves outside Granada” in order to “better understand Gypsy life”, as well as studying the Meilhac/Halévy libretto, and the Merimée novella on which it was based, she became convinced that the local colour imposed on the setting was that of an “imagined tourists’ paradise that never was, and never can be, Spain” – an impression to which both Merimée and Bizet contributed. The production by Piero Faggioni, with designs by Egio Frigerio, intentionally deglamorised the action, staging it as a series of flashbacks as seen by Don José awaiting execution in his prison cell. Faggioni also honed Berganza’s acting abilities to emphasise her qualities as a seductive and spirited independent woman, rather than an exemplar of free love. “She speaks with her heart, her body, her guts,” as she put it. As she engaged with the role, her voice became smokier, more robust and dramatic, as a result of which she went on to essay Suzuki in Madama Butterfly (which she recorded under Giuseppe Sinopoli) and Dulcinée in Massenet’s Don Quichotte. Teresa Berganza Vargas was born in Madrid to parents of sharply divergent ideologies. Her father, Guillermo Berganza, was an accountant of a leftwing, atheist persuasion. He also played the trumpet and piano. Her Catholic mother, Ascensión Vargas, was a monarchist and later a supporter of the future dictator Francisco Franco. Their daughter’s acquired religiosity originally encouraged her to contemplate the direction of a convent choir or the teaching of music at a religious school. It was Aragón who persuaded her to take instead to the stage. At the Madrid conservatory she met her future husband, Félix Lavilla, later a pianist and composer. He became her accompanist, and after their first recital he proposed to her. They married in 1957 and had three children, Teresa, Javier and Cecilia. They had to communicate with her in writing in the run-up to performances, and Cecilia became a soprano herself. The marriage ended in divorce in 1977, and Berganza’s decision to seek spiritual guidance some years later from a Spanish priest, José Rifá, who had long admired her singing, resulted in in Rifá abandoning his vocation in order to marry her, in 1986. The marriage was subsequently annulled and Rifa returned to the priesthood, while Berganza took up yoga and meditation. Alongside her primary operatic roles, she sang French and Italian art songs (sometimes a little dutifully), but also brought a native’s enthusiasm to Spanish zarzuelas, arias and Gypsy ballads. She undertook the role of Salud in her compatriot Manuel de Falla’s La Vida Breve and the Gypsy Woman in Manuel Penella’s El Gato Montés (The Wild Cat). Later in her career she made notable appearances as Carmen in a TV film with Plácido Domingo (1980) and at the opening ceremonies of Expo ’92 in Seville and of the Barcelona Olympics the same year. Her autobiography, Un Monde Habité par le Chant (A World Inhabited by Song), written with Olivier Bellamy, was published in 2013. She is survived by her children.

5/18/2022,"Areported shortage of some hay fever medicine comes in the middle of pollen season. Don’t panic – for a start, stress is thought to exacerbate allergy symptoms. In any case, the active ingredient in short supply, chlorphenamine maleate, found in brands including Piriton and Hayleve, can make you drowsy – and there are lots of other antihistamine medications available. “For anyone over two years old, you would recommend non-sedating antihistamines anyway,” says Margaret Kelman, a specialist allergy nurse and spokesperson for Allergy UK. Here’s what else should help get you through the season. Kelman recommends non-sedating antihistamines for “mild to moderate hay fever [to treat] the immediate itchy, watery, runny nose and itchy, watery eyes”. Eye drops containing sodium chromoglicate or antihistamines can help. If you have a stuffy, congested nose “you would probably need a corticosteroid nasal spray. That’s because there’s a different kind of immune mechanism going on that causes that, and the spray will reduce the inflammation in the nose.” You should speak to your GP first, says Kelman. Locally produced honey has been considered a treatment and the theory seems sensible – that honey can contain pollen, picked by up bees as they collect nectar, so by eating it you can desensitise yourself to it – but there is no evidence it works. Any small amount of pollen in honey comes from flowers, not grasses and trees, which are the main hay fever culprits. There are other supplements and gadgets – including light-therapy devices that can be inserted into the nasal passages to treat inflammation – which claim to reduce symptoms but there is little evidence for them. “Corticosteroid nasal sprays need a couple of weeks to start working,” says Kelman. “Also it’s a good idea to get yourself into the routine of taking anti-histamines.” Worcester University has a pollen calendar so you can start planning. Most hay fever is caused by grass or tree pollen. If you suffer in spring, you’re probably allergic to tree pollen; in later months, it is probably caused by grass pollen. Of course their seasons overlap, and you can be allergic to both, as well as to weed pollens – often from nettle and mugwort – which are around at the same time, so it can be miserable. Generally though, says Kelman, “if you know when your pollen seasons are, you can start pre-dosing a couple of weeks before”. The grass pollen season is starting earlier than average, says Dr Beverley Adams-Groom, a senior palynologist and pollen forecaster at Worcester University’s School of Science and Environment, “with the first high day expected in the south possibly next week, if the weather is warm and dry”. This year, the grass pollen season is likely to be average, she says, “although it all depends on the June weather. If June is wet, then the season will be milder.” If you have severe hay fever, your GP may refer you to an allergy consultant. For the small number of people who don’t benefit from antihistamines and nasal steroids, and whose hay fever is affecting their quality of life, immunotherapy can work. Drops or tablets containing doses of grass or tree pollen, placed under the patient’s tongue daily or administered by monthly injections, “trick the immune system into thinking [the pollen is] OK, and turn off the allergic response and so turn off the hay fever. Some people will use it all year round, other people will use it in the month before their hay fever starts, and then through the season,” says Graham Roberts, who is a professor of paediatric allergy at Southampton University, and runs an allergy clinic. Researchers are working on pre-season treatments that will continue to work throughout but currently “we’re nowhere near that point”, says Roberts. The Met Office has a pollen forecast, and on days of a high pollen count “you know you need to take extra precautions during the day”, says Kelman. This means making sure you have medication with you, including inhalers if you also have asthma. On high-count days, keep house and car windows closed, and don’t dry clothes or bed linen outside. If you can, shift your life around the risk. On high count days, grass pollen is worse in early morning and late afternoon into evening, but in warm parts of the southern UK it can continue all night. In tree pollen season, evenings are less of a problem. Choose a trip to the beach over a day in the park and, if possible, stay out of cities because pollution exacerbates hay fever. “People wonder why they have bad hay fever in big cities because there’s not as much grass,” says Roberts. “But pollution irritates your nose, lungs and eyes so the pollen has a much bigger impact on you. Pollution and pollen together can worsen the symptoms.” A hat with a brim and sunglasses can reduce the amount of pollen “getting into your face and on your hair”, says Kelman. A smear of balm such as Vaseline around the nose and eyes can help trap it. Wearing a mask can also help. “We’ve become familiar with masks, and they’ve been found to be quite effective at reducing the pollen particles that we breathe in,” says Kelman. “A simple cloth mask will act as a partial barrier.” A mask also warms the air we’re breathing “so that makes our airways less reactive”. To avoid bringing pollen into the house, Kelman recommends taking off outer layers of clothing when you come in. “If you haven’t been wearing a hat, then it’s a good idea, when you’ve come back in after a day out, to get in the shower and wash your hair, especially if your symptoms are really bad, and especially before going to bed.” You can rinse your nasal passages and eyes with saline solutions from pharmacies, too. Pets can bring pollen inside – and they can suffer from hay fever too. Wipe cats and dogs down with a damp cloth. “Grass and tree pollen are really fine pollens, [so] you might not necessarily see them, but they can be carried on their fur,” says Kelman.",News/Society,"Can’t buy your hay fever medicine?

5/18/2022,"Record-breaking heatwaves in north-west India and Pakistan have been made 100 times more likely by the climate crisis, according to scientists. The analysis means scorching weather once expected every three centuries is now likely to happen every three years. The region is currently suffering intense heat, with the Indian capital New Delhi setting a new record on Sunday above 49C and the peak temperature in Pakistan reaching 51C. Millions of people are suffering from crop losses, and water and power outages. Climate scientists can link global heating to extreme weather events, showing that the impacts are damaging lives around the world right now, even with a 1.1C rise above pre-industrial global average temperatures. Another study released on Wednesday showed the extreme rainfall that hit Japan during Typhoon Hagibis in 2019 was made 67% more likely by global heating, and that human-caused climate change increased the storm’s damage by $4bn (£3.2bn). Other recent analyses showed devastating floods in South Africa and Europe, heatwaves in North America and the storms in south-east Africa were supercharged by the climate crisis. The new analysis by the UK’s Met Office assessed the record-breaking temperatures in north-west India and Pakistan in April and May 2010. The current heat in the region is on track to surpass this and set a new record. The scientists used 14 computer models to assess two scenarios, one was the heated world of today and the other was a world with no human-caused climate change. They found the 2010 heatwave was 100 times more likely in our hotter world. The analysis also found that such extreme heatwaves will happen almost every year by the end of the century, even if carbon emissions decline. “Spells of heat have always been a feature of the region’s pre-monsoon climate during April and May,” said Dr Nikos Christidis, at the Met Office. “However, our study shows that climate change is driving the heat intensity of these spells.” Paul Hutcheon at the Met Office said: “Maximum temperatures are again likely to reach 50C in some spots later in the week or into the weekend, with continued very high overnight temperatures.” A team of scientists used the same comparison method to show how global heating had exacerbated Typhoon Hagibis. “The negative consequences of the continued burning of fossil fuels are now evident and can be felt also in wealthy countries like Japan,” said Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London and the lead of the World Weather Attribution group. “Unless the world drastically reduces its use of oil, gas and coal, the impacts of human-caused climate change will continue to worsen.” The UN reported on Wednesday that critical global indicators of the climate crisis had broken new records in 2021, from rising oceans to the levels of heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere. “[This] is a dismal litany of humanity’s failure to tackle climate disruption. Fossil fuels are a dead end – environmentally and economically,” said António Guterres, the UN secretary general. Last week, the Guardian revealed that 195 oil and gas “carbon bombs” are planned by the fossil fuel industry, which would drive global heating beyond the 1.5C limit agreed by the world’s nations.",News/Environment,Climate crisis makes extreme Indian heatwaves 100 times more likely – study,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/18/climate-crisis-makes-extreme-indian-heatwaves-100-times-more-likely-study
5/18/2022,"Keir Starmer has urged Boris Johnson to “make up his mind” and impose a windfall tax on North Sea energy firms, adding that the prime minister is “choosing to let people struggle” by delaying any further action. During yet another prime minister’s questions dominated by the cost of living, Starmer used all six of his questions on the single subject. He lambasted Johnson over his refusal to use a windfall tax to reduce energy bills, saying this would inevitably happen, and the “vacillation” was causing significant harm. “Doesn’t he see that every single day he delays his inevitable U-turn – he’s going to do it – he’s choosing to let people struggle when they don’t need to?” the Labour leader said in the Commons. The prime minister had his “head in the sand in the middle of an economic crisis”, Starmer argued, citing a series of occasions in recent weeks when Johnson had promised rapid action to help people with the cost of living. “Doesn’t the prime minister realise that working people across the country can’t afford to wait while he vacillates? It’s time to make his mind up.” Johnson and his ministers have repeatedly said they oppose the idea of a one-off tax on North Sea oil and gas firms, which have earned significant profits amid higher energy costs, as this could affect future investment. However, some ministers, notably the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have held open the possibility of using such a tax if energy firms do not reinvest enough profits. Johnson, similarly, did not rule out the idea completely, saying: “Of course, we will look at all sensible measures. But we will be driven by considerations of growth, investment and employment.” He also condemned Labour for seeking “always and everywhere to raise taxes on businesses”, and said the government had already put in place measures to help people with higher bills. Starmer called Johnson’s approach “as clear as mud”, noting that a series of Conservative MPs and figures from business now backed the idea of a windfall tax. “He just doesn’t get it, does he?” Starmer said. “He doesn’t actually understand what working families are going through in this country, struggling about how they are going to pay their bills. “And whilst he dithers, British households are slapped with an extra £53m on their energy bills every single day.” Starmer went on: “He’s on the side of excess profits for oil and gas companies. We’re on the side of working people. And there you have it.” The Labour leader raised the case of a man who needs night-time dialysis for a kidney condition and who feels “priced out of existence” because of the energy bills this brings, having to turn off the heating and skip meals. “The decisions we make here matter,” Starmer said. “The cost of indecision is enormous. People across the country need action now. The plans are already there. So prime minister, stop the delay. Work with us to put them in place. Do it for households who face bills they can’t afford.”",News/Politics,Keir Starmer: PM choosing to let people struggle by delaying energy windfall tax,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/keir-starmer-pm-choosing-to-let-people-struggle-by-delaying-energy-windfall-tax
5/18/2022,"Sam Gendel and Antonia Cytrynowicz are two of experimental pop music’s most unlikely creative partners. Gendel, 35, is the Los Angeles saxophonist who has lent his talents to records by Vampire Weekend, Maggie Rogers and Perfume Genius, all while maintaining a prolific solo practice that’s among the most appealingly unpredictable in modern jazz. Cytrynowicz is a classic multi-hyphenate – a singer-songwriter who produces her own tracks on GarageBand, dancer, visual artist and actor who’s also a fan of classic 70s rock bands like Rush and Bread. She’s also 12. In reality, the pair are a natural fit. They’ve known each other for a while now – Cytrynowicz is the younger sister of Gendel’s partner, Marcella. Their debut album together, Live a Little, is the product of a little under an hour’s worth of recording at Gendel’s studio, Cytrynowicz conjuring melodies and lyrics in the moment as Gendel played saxophone, guitar and a few other instruments: the resulting record sounds a little like if FKA twigs tried to reinterpret long-lost jazz standards. “We got to do that really vulnerable, intimate thing of improvising together,” Gendel recalls. He shaped the recordings as lightly as possible, “trying to keep the spirit of what it was intact, all the way to the end.” Zooming from a sparse white kitchen in Los Angeles, Gendel and Cytrynowicz are a comically proportioned pair – him tall and lanky, his calm gesticulations in contrast to the almost cosmic metaphors he uses to describe music; her, diminutive, shy and a little mischievous-seeming. As Cytrynowicz describes why she likes Gendel’s music – “I like that it’s very chill, it’s very visual, you picture things in your mind when you listen to it” – and her own writing process, he looks on admiringly. Cytrynowicz credits her musician sister with inspiring her to make music. She used to write lyrics in her notebook and record them into GarageBand, a process that she says she finds difficult now. “I think about it too much and I race. I just don’t like it any more – I prefer to improvise.” Live a Little is remarkable not because it was made by a kid, but because it’s so good – warm and mercurial, there’s an intense mystery to Cytrynowicz’s lyrics which unfold with the cadence of a dream: “Sometimes I feel like / Running up a hill / Not knowing what is there / But just thinking …” The pair didn’t exchange ideas before recording, other than Cytrynowicz noting that she “wanted the overall mood to be melancholic,” Gendel recalls. But they didn’t really need to – Gendel is a seasoned collaborator known for work with artists like oddball bassist Sam Wilkes and indie producer Blake Mills, and found that Cytrynowicz was as keyed in as any of those seasoned pros. “Her playfulness is infectious for someone like me,” he says, “who just always wants to be playing in whatever way with any idea.” “Infectious playfulness” has been a constant of Gendel’s career. He began playing saxophone in the school band, and was introduced to the music of avant garde jazz legends like Rahsaan Roland Kirk by his parents. After studying jazz at the University of Southern California, he fell in with a crowd of innovative, casually adventurous young musicians, among them Wilkes and drummer Louis Cole. In 2017, Gendel began releasing music under his own name, and, since then, new projects have come thick and fast: 2018’s Wilkes collaboration Music for Saxofone & Bass Guitar, and its 2021 sequel, Music for Saxofone & Bass Guitar More Songs; 2020’s reinterpreted standards album Satin Doll, and the saxophone-free, almost-R&B record DRM; and, most notably, last year’s Fresh Bread, a 52-song album of beats, sketches, and vibe pieces that – almost – encompasses everything Gendel does. It’s the most exciting, immersive project of his career, and a nightmare to slot into a modern musical landscape. Does he ever feel the need to taxonomise his work into jazz songs, rap songs, R&B songs, and so on? “The jazz thing – I don’t even know how to speak to that any more,” he says, sounding exasperated. “People use ‘jazz’ just in the weirdest way, that I just can’t relate.” He describes his approach to releasing music as “kind of a spring … kind of how nature operates”. He acknowledges his debt to the history of jazz, but concludes: “I don’t know what I do.” A collaborator like Cytrynowicz, then, who works with what Gendel says is an uncommonly free-ranging sense of creativity, is perfect for someone looking to elude categorisation. “She’s just not in any box at all, there’s just not a box,” he says. Throughout our conversation, he describes the recording of Live a Little as something totally synergistic – the kind of thing where, in an instant, they were “just buzzing”. You can feel their unique chemistry and drive for pure creativity in the finished product. It’s a testament to the wit and ease with which both artists make music – a refreshingly nonlinear approach that’s about just taking an idea and putting it into the world without fanfare or fuss. Gendel sums it up neatly: “I’m really just trying to have fun and take the ideas that come and make them real, as much as possible.”  Live a Little is out now on Psychic Hotline.",Arts/Music,‘Her playfulness is infectious’: meet the 12-year-old behind 2022’s most beguiling album,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/18/antonia-cytrynowicz-sam-gendel-live-a-little-interview
