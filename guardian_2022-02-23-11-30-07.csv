2/23/2022,"How did we get here from there? The Who’s Tommy, like its central character, has taken possibly the most circuitous route in the history of musical theatre to arrive at St Kilda’s Palais Theatre, in an Australian premiere production by Victorian Opera. It started life in 1968 as a concept album, and arguably became the defining example of rock opera. Over the years, it would transmogrify into an increasingly baroque series of symphonic concerts and then a 1975 film directed by the king of excess, Ken Russell. It wasn’t until 1992 that the Who’s Pete Townshend adapted it into a Broadway musical, for better and for worse.Tommy is the story of a “deaf, dumb and blind kid” who, traumatised by an act of violence as a child, suffers from a kind of locked-in syndrome that is never adequately explained. He rises to fame as a pinball wizard and eventually becomes a cult leader, a position he finally rejects. It’s heavily influenced by the teachings of Indian spiritualist Meher Baba and, depending on your taste, is either the final word on countercultural self-actualisation or a pretentious pseudo-religious dirge. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning  Townshend, in adapting the material into a musical, has clarified the dramatic action but also somewhat neutered its central theme; the satirical edges of the story have been blunted, the provocations that made it seem so radical at the time sanitised beyond recognition. Russell pushed the work into garishly surreal territory, and Townshend seems to have brought it back not so much to its original state, but to a kind of anodyne halfway house. It isn’t disastrous, but it makes for a far safer night in the theatre. Tommy retreats into semiconsciousness because he witnesses his second world war fighter pilot dad kill his mother’s new boyfriend. (In Russell’s film, it’s the boyfriend who kills the dad, a Freudian renting of more significance.) Emotional and sexual abuse follow, but in this stage version those darker aspects of the story are so toned down they barely register. The extremity of Tommy’s suffering is supposed to mirror the passion of Christ, and without it this messianic quality is lost. In this iteration, Tommy’s journey to selfhood is less a sacred and more a purely psychological one. Fortunately, there are compensations aplenty. It isn’t surprising that Victorian Opera’s commitment to the quality of the music is at the forefront; what is extraordinary is how expertly the sound design (Peter Grubb) merges with some truly superb singing to create a wondrous polyphony. Mat Verevis is magnificent as Tommy, his rock inflections effortless and his pure tenor beautifully soulful. Amy Lehpamer and Matt Hetherington are strong as mum and dad, although Lehpamer is criminally underused in the first act and neither of them get to display the depravity Ann-Margret and Oliver Reed relished in the film.Kanen Breen is suitably icky as Uncle Ernie, and Vincent Hooper makes for a repugnant Cousin Kevin – Tommy intriguingly turns these two tormentors into his management and security at the height of his pinball fame – and Paul Capsis uses that outrageous falsetto to lift the roof as the Acid Queen (a role that in the film was offered to Mick Jagger and eventually played by Tina Turner). The rest of the ensemble are terrific, harmonious and vivid throughout. Director Roger Hodgman, perennially under-appreciated in this country, does a superb job of coordinating the action, shaping the tonal shifts and pressing the emotional registers. If the early scenes have an episodic quality to them, a sense of props and sets being wheeled needlessly on and off, the flow improves as the show progresses, until the finale achieves an expansiveness that borders on the transcendent. Matt Scott’s lighting is somehow both subdued and maximalist, and Isaac Lummis’s costumes are beautifully judged. The Who’s Tommy is something of an oddity in the annals of musical theatre, partway between conventional narrative and rock oratorio. Musically, it is incredibly rich and varied – Jack Earle’s musical direction brilliantly illuminates the score’s breadth and melodic force – even if it makes little dramatic sense. The Who were a band desperate to define their era, its tilt towards youth idolisation and generational rebellion, and there is something uneasy about the way their material is cramped into the musical theatre form and then viewed from the distance of time. The Who’s Tommy feels disconnected to its source, and lacks the freewheeling perversity of the original. And yet, it still has a strange potency to it, an allegorical heft that echoes down the decades. Tommy might not be able to heal us, but in this admirable production we certainly see, hear and feel him.

2/23/2022,"Workers’ wages rose at the fastest annual pace in more than three years during the December quarter but the gain lagged the increase in consumer prices. In the final three months of 2021, the wage price index rose 0.7% in seasonally adjusted terms, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. The increase was in line with economists’ estimates.  On an annual basis, the index was up 2.3% on the previous December quarter, the fastest seasonally adjusted increase since the September quarter of 2018. The quarterly increase was enjoyed equally by private and public sector workers but on an annual basis those in private jobs picked up a 2.4% increase compared with 2.1% in public work, the ABS said. By contrast, consumer prices rose 3.5% in the December quarter from a year earlier, while the underlying rate was 2.6% when more volatile changes are removed. “Wage pressure continued to build over the December quarter for jobs with specific skills,” Michelle Marquardt, head of the ABS’s prices statistics unit, said. “The proportion of pay rises reported over the December quarter was higher than usually seen at this time of year,” she said. “The implementation of the last phases of award updates and state-based public sector enterprise agreements, on top of a rising number of wage and salary reviews, drove wages up 0.7% over the quarter.” Union leaders have warned they will step up industrial action to ensure that workers’ wages at least keep up with cost of living increases. NSW, for instance, has a 2.5% cap on annual wage increases that is being tested by health, rail and other unions. Academics have pointed out a slew of reasons why salary increases can be difficult to obtain even as the jobless rate drops to 13-year lows and is potentially heading to the lowest since the mid-70s if it falls below 4%. Among the different industries, retail trade recorded the largest quarterly rise of any sector, at 1.2% in the December quarter. It was the fastest pace of increase since the September quarter of 2015, the ABS said. At the other end of the spectrum, the education and training industry posted the slowest rate of quarterly wage growth, at 0.3%, with the ABS citing influences of the expiry of several key enterprise agreements. Over the year, the accommodation and food services industry recorded the highest rate of growth despite all the Covid-related disruptions to travel. The 3.5% increase reflected the Fair Work Commission annual wage decision during 2021. Those in the electricity, gas, water and waste services industries would have been disappointed with their wage increases, with those sectors up just 1.3% in the December quarter on an annual basis, to lag other fields, the ABS said. The data was a key figure for those speculating about whether the Reserve Bank will have to lift its official case rate from the record low 0.1% before too many months pass. Prior to today’s data release, investors were tipping the first increase to come either in June or July, assuming the first rise by the RBA is to 0.25%. Sean Langcake, head of macroeconomic forecasting for BIS Oxford Economics, said wage increases in the private sector were again driven by individual arrangements.“These contracts are the most responsive to tightening labour market conditions, and strength in this component is a positive sign for broader wage growth in the near term,” Langcake said. “Wages including bonuses are growing faster than the measure that excludes bonuses,” he said. “This is a sign that employers are paying more to attract and retain staff, and could spill over into higher base payments.” Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, described the data as showing “a continued trend of moderate wages growth” that was “broadly consistent with underlying inflation”. “In the upcoming annual wage review, any push for unsustainable wages growth would likely risk the viability of businesses and the jobs they sustain and create,” McKellar said. “It’s critical that increased productivity drives wages growth in 2022.”",News/Australia news,Australian wages rise at fastest pace in more than three years in December quarter,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/23/australians-wages-rise-at-fastest-pace-in-more-than-three-years-in-december-quarter
