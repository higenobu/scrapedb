1/28/2022,"One rattlesnake on the porch is bad, but an Arizona family recently found two and it quickly became clear the venomous reptiles were mating. That meant they intended to stay for awhile — and did not want to be disturbed. It happened at a home in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the family resorted to calling a professional rattlesnake catching service, Rattlesnake Solutions. The service sent snake wrangler Marissa Maki, who says it was a first for everyone, including her. Video posted by Rattlesnake Solutions shows she arrived to find two western diamondback rattlesnakes inches from the door — with their tails entwined. The pair immediately went on the defensive, slithering and rattling as they scrambled into a corner. Letting them finish was not a safe option, Maki told McClatchy News. “They can be locked up for hours, so we don’t wait,” she said. “But we hope by making the process of capture and release as fast and smooth as possible, they will continue mating.” Both were over 3 feet long and formidable, she said. Western diamondback rattlesnakes average 3 to 5 feet, with some growing to 7 feet, according to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. The video shows she quickly scooped up both with a very long pair of snake tongs, and lowered them into the same bucket (with a tight-fitting lid) for transport to a wilderness area. Maki later released them — alive and unharmed — in “a sweet cave.” “Hopefully, they can get back to it and make some cute little babies,” she says in the video. It marked the third time the family encountered rattlesnakes on their property, including another instance of one being on the porch, according to the video. “They weren’t scared, (but) they were not thrilled the snakes were blocking the door,” Maki said. “Depending on the time of year, people only tend to have one rattlesnake in there yard. And if they do have more than one, usually they don’t know about it until we search around and find it.” Dead man — and 100-plus snakes — found in rural Maryland home.

1/28/2022,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has no heart of gold when it comes to Neil Young. The far-right lawmaker parodied the rock icon’s “My My, Hey Hey” song to mock him after he demanded that Spotify remove his music. Young blasted the streaming platform for airing Joe Rogan’s hugely popular podcasts, which regularly spout dangerous misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,” Young wrote. Spotify then announced it would honor Young’s request, seemingly siding with Rogan. “Bye Bye, Hey Hey Neil Young is gone today It’s better to boycott Than to just obey Bye Bye, Hey Hey,” Paul wrote on Twitter. “Seeya @Neilyoung.” Rand tried to strike a conciliatory tone in praising Young’s Kent State ballad “Ohio” as “one of the greatest protest songs of all time,” but Twitter wasn’t having it. People used some of Young’s music to clap back at the senator. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

1/28/2022,"Officers in Pennsylvania are searching for a man who they say shot at a woman who accidentally bumped into him at a grocery store. The woman, who Coatesville Police Department officers say is in her 20s, apologized to the man after bumping into him at Coatesville Market on Jan. 26, according to a news release. But the suspect, identified as 26-year-old Moenell Coleman, became irate and threatened to shoot her, police say. She left the store and was followed by Coleman, who allegedly continued to threaten her. When she made it to her home a block away, Coleman approached her as she stood in the front door, police said. Coleman opened fire on the woman and one bullet grazed her leg. Her brother, who was inside the home, was also shot, according to Coatesville police. The woman was treated at the scene and her brother was hospitalized. His condition was not stated. Police are searching for Coleman, who is being charged with two counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, and various firearm charges. Coleman has ties to Wilmington, Delaware, and Norristown, Pennsylvania, and is considered armed and dangerous, police said. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Coatesville Police Department at 610-384-2300. Coatesville is about 45 miles west of Philadelphia.

1/28/2022,"After an unthinkable tragedy, this personal trainer is making fitness accessible to all.  Sydney Cummings is a National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) certified personal trainer and fitness nutrition specialist. When Cummings experienced a profound loss, it changed her approach to life. Now she and her fiancé Dustin Houdyshell have co-founded Royal Change — a digital fitness company that offers free high-quality workouts with no ads to people all over the world.  Check out these pro tips for party-planning on a budget on this episode of Getting Rich, sponsored by Acura “Royal Change actually formed into the digital media company that it is after the passing of my younger brother, Zac,” Cummings tells In The Know. “He was 24 years old. He just had a daughter, just got married and got in an ATV accident [after] which he passed away when he was about three weeks post-accident.”  At the time, Cummings was a personal trainer while Houdyshell worked as a freelance photographer and accountant. Neither of them felt fulfilled at their jobs and Zac’s death emphasized how short life is.  “My brother inspires me every day to continue to think bigger and level up and scale the service that I’m providing to people all over the world who, without this business, I would have never had the chance to meet or inspire,” Cummings says.  Just when the couple launched their YouTube channel in 2018, they faced another terrible setback. A group of four men attacked Cummings and Houdyshell as they were leaving their home. Cummings was shot in the foot. She couldn’t put any weight on her foot for three and a half months.  “Never having experienced any type of injury as a Division I athlete, as a lifelong athlete, this truly gave me a whole different perspective on strength and recovery,” she says. The athlete put herself in the shoes of people who were in recovery or total beginners to exercise. She promised herself that as long as she could walk again, she would show up “in the best way possible for my workout.”     A post shared by Sydney Cummings (@sydneycummings_) “I kind of committed to showing that to my YouTube audience no matter what. No matter how weak I felt, or how off-balance I felt,” Cummings recalls. “In my head, I just kept thinking there’s someone out there who needs this to be something that they see. And someone needs to be able to believe in the possibility of their comeback.”  As far as keeping up a fitness routine without burning out, Cummings’ advice is simple.  “You don’t have to change your whole life tonight and wake up tomorrow as a new person,” she says. “You just have to establish one habit that’s really beneficial for you and keep that habit going.”  Once you’ve formed the healthy habit, she says to try what she calls “habit stacking.”  “Where maybe tomorrow you start waking up and drinking water, and you really crush that for a week,” Cummings explains. “Then after that, maybe the next week you wake up and drink that water, still keeping that going, but also add in a stretch.”  Finding a supportive community is also crucial. However, it can be difficult since not everyone is always on board with changing their lifestyle.  “Reach out to the one or two people that you know do this already in your life, and tell them about your goals. Tell them what you’re going to start doing and just have that person there,” Cummmings advises.  The support can be offline or online as long as it makes you feel less alone in your journey. Her last piece of advice is to reward yourself for your hard work.  “Do things that keep you going in a positive direction. Keep you moving forward toward your goal,” she says. “So maybe it’s something like a new pair of socks that really feel great when you work out. Or it’s a new water bottle or some type of new fitness apparel that keeps you excited to be active.” In the end, committing to fitness is just another way of prioritizing yourself.  “We all have different goals,” Cummings says. “But at the end of the day, the common denominator has to be that we dedicate ourselves, and we decide to keep the promise long after the mood is gone.”  Shop In The Know cover star Storm Reid's high-fashion looks In The Know is now available on Apple News — follow us here!
