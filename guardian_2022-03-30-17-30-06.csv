3/30/2022,"Russian shells have bombarded the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv overnight, its mayor has said, just hours after the Kremlin claimed it would halt attacks there and in Kyiv out of respect for ongoing peace talks. Vladyslav Atroshenko said the Russians had lied and were continuing to indiscriminately attack the encircled city, which is less than 100 miles north of the country’s capital. Authorities in Chernihiv estimate that about 400 people have died since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February, with civilians living now without electricity, gas or water. Atroshenko said: “The night was just as we expected, that [everything Russia promised] is a lie from the beginning till the end, that’s why at night we had some serious shelling at night. And the Russians were trying to destroy all possible means of crossing Desna River towards Kyiv.” Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said on Tuesday during talks in Istanbul that Moscow wanted to “increase mutual trust, create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine”, and that the Kremlin would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, responded that while there had been “positive” signals from the latest talks “they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”. “The enemy is still in our territory,” he said. “The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and airstrikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts.” Atroshenko, who has called for Kyiv not to swap captured pilots who had operated above Chernihiv for Ukrainian prisoners of war, said there had been no evidence any withdrawal over the last 24 hours from around his city. He said: “The locals live in a real humanitarian crisis for weeks with no electricity, no heating, no water, only in some areas of the city there’s gas [natural gas, not petrol]. Thousands of buildings are destroyed. Yesterday our district, Liotka, was shelled especially heavily, where a few people died and dozens were injured. “Have you ever met liars in your life? What stands behind their lies? They are just liars. They lie all the time! [Sergei] Lavrov [the Russian foreign minister] lies that this is just an ‘operation’, Russian military lies when they say that this ‘operation’ is against the armed forces of Ukraine, and we say that they purposefully are destroying civilians, they purposefully dropping bombs on civilians in broad daylight at low heights, they are bombing us with 120mm mines and you know this is not a precise weapons, its just bombing the entire city.” Britain’s deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, said the claims from the Kremlin had to be treated with caution. He said: “We judge the Russian military machine by its actions, not its words. There is obviously scepticism that it will regroup to attack again. “The door to diplomacy will always be left ajar but I don’t think you can trust what is coming out of the mouth of [Vladimir] Putin’s war machine.” Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has said that while Russian troops were partly withdrawing, it appeared to be merely “a rotation of individual units” and that Moscow was seeking to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not seen anything indicating that talks were progressing in a “constructive way” and suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”. Speaking on a visit to Morocco, Blinken said there was “what Russia says, and what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter. What Russia is doing is the continued brutalisation of Ukraine.” Ukraine presented Russian negotiators in Istanbul with a framework for peace under which it would remain neutral with its security guaranteed by third-party countries including the US, the UK, France, Turkey, China and Poland, in an arrangement similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits members to defend one another. It also said it would be willing to agree to a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, with both countries agreeing not to use their militaries to resolve the issue in the meantime, and called for Russia to drop its objection to Ukrainian membership of the EU.",News/World news,Russia bombards Chernihiv hours after pledging to halt shelling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/ukraine-russia-bombards-chernihiv-hours-after-pledging-to-halt-shelling
3/30/2022,"“I saw a stat that Luka Modric has played in around 42% of all Croatia’s international games. On quick research, I found one player who can beat that (Fatos Beciraj of Montenegro at 67.5% but is there anyone else who has played in an even higher percentage of their nation’s games?” asks Richard Wilson. Let’s start with a bit of housekee … wait, come back! There are so many different statistical resources on the internet, and a dispiritingly small number of them agree on, for example, how many games Gibraltar have played (belated spoiler alert!). So in the name of consistency we’ve taken the relevant data from RSSSF.com, adding this week’s games and cross-checking with the equally comprehensive eu-football.info. Our first port of call is a principality in the eastern Pyrenees. “Ildefons Lima has played in 70.7% of Andorra’s games (133 of 188) ,” writes James Turley. “He played at Wembley last year, aged 41, and hasn’t retired yet so that figure could yet inch higher.” Dara O’Reilly has the names of a couple of Kosovans. “Since their accession to Fifa in 2014, Kosovo have played 62 recognised international matches,” writes Dara. “Torino’s Mergim Vojvoda have featured in 45 of them, while another Serie A stopper, Napoli’s Amir Rrahmani, has played 44. That’s 72.9% and 71%, respectively.” There are a few candidates in the Gibraltar team, as mentioned by David Ekstrand and Ben Blatch-Hanlon among others. Gibraltar have played 66 full internationals, of which Liam Walker has appeared in 59 (or 89.4%), Roy Chipolina 57 (86.4%) and Joseph Chipolina 47 (71.2%). Gibraltar’s stats will change over time but Saarland’s are probably set in stone. “Saarland was a French protectorate partitioned from Germany after the second world war,” notes Phil Mollicone. “Before rejoining the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957, Saarland played 19 internationals. Of those, the defender Waldemar Philippi played 18, or 94.7%.” It’s worth mentioning a couple of other Saarland players: Herbert Martin won 17 caps, playing in 89.5% of games, and Gerhard Siedl 16 (or 84.2%). Philippi’s record is pretty impressive, but we may have found a man who played in 100% of his country’s games. Stuart Fryer points out that the Dutch East Indies – a colony that later became Indonesia – played five official internationals in the 1930s, including one match at the 1938 World Cup. “I haven’t been able to find the team for their final game, a friendly against the Netherlands,” notes Stuart, “but the majority of the squad played in at least three of their five competitive games, and one, Hong Dien, played in at least four of their five games.” According to RSSSF, Hong Dien (or THE Hong Djien as they call him) appeared in that final game, which makes it five out of five. And if you’re not satisfied by that, there’s a more modern example. Navin Patel points out that the Gibraltar women’s team includes six players who have appeared in all six of their internationals: Kyrelle Revagliatte, Tiffany Viagas, Reighann Mascarenhas-Olivero, Naomi Victor, Joelle Gilbert and Shania Robba. In last week’s Knowledge we looked at neighbouring football clubs in different countries. And there are loads more, so many that we’re going to present them without comment and in no particular order … “Carlisle United in Cumbria are just 19 miles from Annan Athletic in Scottish League Two. Even closer from Carlisle are Gretna, who play in the Scottish Lowland League,” writes Peter Hunt. “Dundalk FC in the League of Ireland Premier Division (ground – Oriel Park) and Warrenpoint Town FC (ground – Milltown) in the Northern Ireland Football Premier Division are 35km apart by road but only 16km as the crow flies,” suggests Paul Callan. Also: “It’s only 16 miles between Oriel Park and Newry City’s ground,” adds Johnny Turner. Paul has another: “Derry City FC (ground: The Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium) and Finn Harps FC (ground: Finn Park, Ballybofey, Co. Donegal) both play in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland (although Derry City is in N. Ireland) and are 40km apart by road.” “The distance between Juárez’s Estadio Olímpico Benito Juárez and El Paso Locomotive’s Southwest University Park is just 1.5 miles/2.4km,” points out Liam Searle, “though in reality it’d take an hour to walk.” “San Diego Loyal SC (playing in USL, second division in the USA) and Club Tijuana (playing in Liga MX, first division in Mexico),” begins Kevin McAllister. “The distance from Torero Stadium in San Diego to Caliente Stadium in Tijuana is 25 miles.” “Laredo Heat SC in Texas and Nuevo Laredo Bravos CF across the Rio Grande river in Mexico,” suggests Eddie Bellion, a retired Fifa referee. “Probably not much more than 10 miles between them.” “Detroit City Football Club and Windsor TFC in Ontario, Canada,” begins Mike Ruddy. “According to Google Maps, the teams’ stadiums are 9.5 miles apart, whether crossing the Detroit River by bridge or tunnel.” “Do not forget Gibraltar’s Victoria stadium, where all club teams in Gibraltar play,” shouts Nick Corea. “It is located less than 1.5km from Estadio Municipal de La Línea de la Concepción, where Spanish third division (sort of, it gets complicated after Segunda; ask Sid Lowe) side Real Balompédica Linense play. They’re probably the closest stadiums in different countries to host international matches, with Gibraltar playing at Victoria and two nations, Spain and Andorra, hosting in La Línea.” “I’d like to nominate FC Helsingør and Helsingborgs IF,” nominates William Jansen. “Helsingør are leading the second tier in Denmark and Helsingborgs IF were just promoted to the Swedish top flight. Helsingør is just 5km from Helsingborg. The teams play an annual pre-season friendly known as ‘The Øresund Derby’ (named after the strait between the countries).” “How about KFC Komárno in the Slovak Second Division and Komáromi VSE in the Hungarian Third (West)?” muses Peterjon Cresswell. “They represent Komárno and Komárom, actually one town until a century ago. Now they’re divided by the Danube and a border running down the middle of it. Unfortunately, the Gods of football decree that although the opposing neighbours are only 1.5km apart, the grounds are 19km as KFC play in Hurbanovo just outside Komárno.” “ND Gorica of Slovenia play in Športni Park Nova Gorica in Nova Gorica,” mails Tim Dockery. “Across the border in Italy are AS Pro Gorizia, who play at the Stadio Campagnuzza. According to Google Maps, the distance between the two stadiums as the crow flies is 2.15 km, but on foot it would be 2.8km.” Tim has another example from South America. “Monumental Rio Parapití is the fifth largest stadium in Paraguay and hosted a number of games at the 1999 Copa América. It is also the home of Club 2 de Mayo of Paraguay’s second tier. Across the avenue in Brazil, is the Estadio Municipal Aral Moreira, home to SE Pontaporanense. The distance between the two stadiums is 2.3km as the crow flies, but 2.5km if you were to walk.” “Nice and Monaco, grounds 20km apart across an international border,” writes Charles of the Ligue 1 sides. “Wrexham obviously play in the English system but there are a plethora of Welsh Premier League teams around them,” reports Micky Smith. “The closest is Gresford Athletic, who play in Cymru North (second tier) at a mere 5.7km door to door.” “Is it worth throwing in The New Saints (Welsh Premier League and regular participants in European football) and St Martins (NWCL Division 1 South for now)?” asks Steve Howard. Yes. “Both share the Park Hall Stadium in Oswestry, England, yet the New Saints are ‘Welsh’ and St Martins play in the English pyramid.” Then of course there’s the one-club case of Chester City … And finally, an amendment. “Never mind Fortuna Sittard,” writes Wim Joefs (and others). The Roda JC stadium in Kerkrade, the Netherlands, is less than 15km from Alemmania Aachen.” “Between 1911 and 1927, there was a run of 13 consecutive FA Cup finals in which the runners-up failed to score (14 matches if you include the 1912 replay),” notes John Stephenson. “Are there any examples of longer consecutive runs in other club finals anywhere?” What is the most a goalkeeper has conceded in their one and only football league career game?For example, Michael Theoklitis for Norwich. One appearance, 7 goals conceded. Never played again. Is Jordan Spence the first professional footballer to attend an Oscar ceremony, given that he popped up as wife Naomi Scott's plus one at this weekend's ceremony? “Ivo Stas is legendary for scoring an own goal against Aston Villa while playing for Banik Ostrava in 1990. Villa subsequently signed him; he promptly picked up an injury in his first training session and never featured for Villa. Are there any other players who scored for their team without ever playing for them?” asks Stuart Fryer.

3/30/2022,"My wife and kids have a tough time believing that I fear nothing supernatural. Because they do. They fear all of them. Ghosts, goblins, werewolves, wendigos, all that claptrap. I just don’t. When they tell me that this is strange, considering I’m the only one of us who goes to mass every Sunday and literally eats the body and blood of a man who came back from the dead, I distract them by showing them my latest Day-Glo Virgin Mary statue which plays Ave Maria. My youngest teen, Sharkie, gives me a list of her scariest games ever. Apparently one of them is bound to give me nightmares. I start with Resident Evil 7: Biohazard because everyone says it’s terrifying and the original Resident Evil game did genuinely scare me, back in the days when I experienced fear. I am sorry to disappoint the legions of people who have needed underwear changes exploring that house, but for me the most frightening thing about it is that they are still using tape recorders as save points. “But what about the jump scares, Dad?” asks Sharkie, as I switch it off after six enjoyable but not remotely terrifying hours. “Jump scares, jump schmares,” I say. Most video games use jump scares, don’t they? Every time a whoosh of fire comes out of a block in a platform game, that’s a jump scare. Jack Baker saying “Welcome to the family” isn’t any more of a jump scare than tearing right into some spikes on a new screen in Sonic the Hedgehog. They both make you go, “AARGH!” Also, in Resident Evil 7 you have weapons. The minute you are concentrating on ammo resources and targeting the head, the game becomes a shoot ’em up rather than a scary experience. “Ah,” Sharkie says, “you need to try the weapons-free genre.” So I go through Outlast and The Evil Within and Amnesia: The Dark Descent. I like the idea that all you can do is run and hide in those games, replicating far more accurately what would happen in a real-life supernatural horror situation. Each has a genuinely anxiety-inducing atmosphere … which is utterly shattered when I take a few goes to get past a particularly scary bastard because I realise I’m just playing a game. When you die and come back, it’s like the lights going on in the cinema. Again and again and again. Amnesia: The Dark Descent may have given me nightmares, but I’ll never know because it told me to “play with headphones on in a dark room”. Don’t tell me what to do when it comes to video games! Don’t you know who I was!? I ran a cable outside into my garden and played it under the blazing heat of the midday sun, with the sound running through some tiny Sony SR7 speakers I used with my Walkman in the 1990s. Couldn’t see or hear a bloody thing. Didn’t scare me at all. That’ll show them! Sharkie suggests I switch genres and try the more hack-and-slashy Bloodborne. Immense fun. But no game that asks you to name your character at the beginning can be scary when your default video game name since Kevin Toms’ Football Manager in 1982 has been Pants McPants. I get annoyed with myself for not being scared playing Little Nightmares II, because that is genuinely a work of art; breathtakingly disturbing visuals and that whole “I have woken up in a world I don’t understand” quality. But once again, multiple restarts ruin the total immersion that true horror requires. The very nature of games – control, via a controller – is the opposite of the helplessness you feel when you watch a horror movie and can’t control anything. The moment a character investigates the scary sound in the dark basement chains you to the horror momentum until the character meets their grisly end. It’s shocking and scary, and you are emotionally invested. At the precise moment horror should be the most terrifying in a video game, you die. And return. Alive. The spell is broken. But I was scared playing Resident Evil in the 1990s. And Silent Hill. Why am I not scared now? The cliche to reach for here is that real life in 2022 is scarier than any manufactured horror. Covid, wildfires, the war in Ukraine, disinformation spewed by governments whose arrogant malfeasance kills our elderly parents. Those are some resident evils. But I think it’s more than that. I grew up with equally terrifying things when I was younger: the threat of nuclear war, Aids and getting my head kicked in by Stephen Gibson. I was still scared of Salem’s Lot. But supernatural scares require a supernatural imagination. A belief in the possibility of anything. And the older we get, the less willing we are to believe in possibilities. In my 20s anything was possible. In your 40s? Life shrinks. Opportunity shrinks. The world shrinks. You realise you’ll never safari the Serengeti or dive the Great Barrier Reef. Depressingly, you stop believing in everything that you can’t see with your own eyes. The things that pay the rent, feed your kids and keep your ageing body ticking over. You can’t be scared running away from wendigos in Until Dawn if you can’t even walk the day after kicking a ball around the garden with your kid. No. Survival horror video games won’t scare me until they release Resident Evil 12: The Doctor Calls About Your Stool Sample.",Arts/Games,Why aren’t video games scary any more – am I just old and jaded? | Dominik Diamond,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/30/horror-video-games-resident-evil-middle-aged-jaded
3/30/2022,"This is Tarantino for ankle-biters with a bit of Ocean’s 11 thrown in: funny, energetic and just smart enough. It’s an animated caper from DreamWorks about a gang of career criminals, crewed by five of the animal kingdom’s worst of the worst: a wolf, shark, snake, piranha and tarantula. Tropic Thunder writer Etan Cohen, adapting the kids’ books by Aaron Blabey, gives us some tongue-in-cheek comedy, though perhaps not quite enough originality to make it actually memorable. Leader of the Bad Guys is smooth-talking Mr Wolf (voiced by Sam Rockwell, doing his suavest George Clooney impersonation). After a series of front-page heists, the Bad Guys are caught red-handed trying to steal a gold statue being awarded to a philanthropic guinea pig. He’s Professor Marmalade, a wet do-gooder beautifully played with a passive-aggressive whine by Richard Ayoade. To dodge a stretch in the clink, the Bad Guys pretend to go straight. The trouble is that Mr Wolf gets a taste for the good life. In one very funny moment, his tail wags uncontrollably after a virtuous deed, to his mortification. There’s a lot to like about this movie, partly because it’s got decent female characters who kick butt in genuinely interesting and non-cliched ways. Atlanta’s Zazie Beetz is supremely classy as the city’s Hillary 2.0 pantsuit-wearing, electric-car-driving governor, a sassy fox called Diane Foxington. (This ought to put Beetz on the go-to list for live-action butt-kickers). Awkwafina plays Tarantula, a super-cool hacker. If we are being honest, The Bad Guys relies on some secondhand plot developments and double-crosses that you can see coming from the moon. That said, the five-year-old sitting next to me whooped with glee watching a horde of zombified guinea pigs swarm a bridge – and gave the whole movie a score of 10 stars out of five. Really, you could do worse over the Easter holidays.

3/30/2022,"After Lucy Easthope lost her first baby to a miscarriage, she kept everything, from the pregnancy test and her first scan to the hospital appointment slips, in a brightly coloured shoebox. As a disaster expert whose responsibilities include making the loss of loved ones as bearable as possible for those left behind, she had plenty of experience working on memory boxes, right down to the package design (“too ‘gifty’ and it looked all wrong”). These boxes might contain anything from a charred passport or a wedding band to the wrapper from a packet of mints. Easthope understood the importance of preserving these items for grieving relatives, and now she was doing it for herself. Her shoebox of memories of her baby was, for her, “proof that she had been. That she had existed.” Easthope is one of the UK’s leading authorities on emergency planning. She is the person who assesses the scale of a disaster and what is needed to ensure smooth operations in the aftermath. Over the course of her career, she has advised on chemical spillages, volcanoes, fires, floods and terrorist attacks. She lent her expertise to operations around the 2004 tsunami, the 7/7 bombings, the Grenfell fire and, most recently, the British response to Covid-19: “We are all disaster survivors now,” she writes. Her work has an even more immediate resonance in the light of the invasion of Ukraine, with images of shattered apartment buildings and lines of refugees suddenly ubiquitous. As well as dealing with immediate practicalities, high up on her agenda are the needs of those left behind: the displaced, the traumatised, the bereaved. When the Dust Settles is Easthope’s candid, unsettling and at times darkly funny account of a life spent planning for and dealing with the aftershocks of catastrophe. Highly specialised and not for the faint-hearted, hers is a role that tends not to be lauded in the way that the work of paramedics or firefighters is, since much of it takes place behind closed doors. “We are a Cinderella service,” she notes, “sweeping up below stairs.” Among Easthope’s early jobs was preparing for returning bodies from Iraq after the invasion by coalition forces in 2003. A year ahead of time, she was given the task of building a mortuary that could house thousands of corpses, some of which might be contaminated with the chemical weapons it was alleged the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had been stockpiling. And so, while the Stop the War marches made their way through the streets of London, Easthope was tracking down flags, coffins and body bags. In 2005, when suicide bombers activated explosives in three locations on the London underground and another on a London bus, Easthope – who was on the tube herself at the time – sprang into action. Among her more unlikely instructions was to find a hawk to scare off scavenging pigeons. This trick was learned from the operations at New York’s Ground Zero where it was discovered that, in the weeks following 9/11, pigeons were picking up small human bones from the site and building them into their nests. Easthope is excellent on these small yet significant details, which provide an insider’s perspective on situations that most of us will only ever experience via news reports. The disasters recalled here often read like short stories, each of them filled with high drama, surreal twists and, in some cases, mysteries to be solved. But there is much about the author that remains beyond our reach; analysis of disaster zones may be second nature to Easthope, but analysis of the self is more of a challenge. She attributes her choice of career to the Hillsborough disaster – a native of Liverpool, she was a child when it happened and saw how the resulting trauma and anger reverberated through communities for years to come. But this doesn’t fully explain her motivations, or the makeup of an individual who sees the “beauty of [human] decomposition and the way that we break down into our constituent chemicals and minerals”. Elsewhere, it is with a clear sense of distance that she reflects on the careful collection and storage of body parts, or how the smell of death “has put me off mushrooms for life”, or the fact that she feels “at home in a disaster mortuary”. What might seem shocking and gruesome to the reader is merely part of a day’s work for her. Nonetheless, Easthope emerges as a likable, quietly stoical and ultimately heroic character who has endured her own hardships and whose instinctive empathy and compassion make a tangible difference to the lives of people at their most vulnerable. She invokes the Welsh word hiraeth, which she first heard when researching the Aberfan tragedy in Wales that killed 144 after a colliery spoil tip collapsed in 1966, and for which there is no direct English translation. It means longing for a place or a state of being to which there is no return. While Easthope has seen for herself that there is life after tragedy, she also understands that “disaster is perpetual, chronic, with a pain that ebbs and flows like tides”.

3/30/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has rejected suggestions the government’s $8.6bn cost of living package is an attempt to bribe voters as Labor savages the Coalition’s budget as a “cynical ploy” to get re-elected. With the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to unveil a major health policy in his budget in reply speech on Thursday night, the opposition is painting this year’s budget as a political document only focused on the May election. Labor waved the cost of living measures through parliament’s lower house on Wednesday, which include a one-off $250 payment for pensioners and welfare card holders, a $420 boost to the low and middle income tax offset, and a 22 cent per litre cut to the fuel excise. But Albanese said the handout was aimed at securing the government a fourth term in office when voters go to the polls in May, saying “they may as well have stapled cash” to people’s how-to-vote cards. “Last night’s budget … was a cynical exercise by a cynical government that doesn’t have a plan for Australia’s future, they just have a plan for themselves,” Albanese told the ABC. “This is a plan for an election, not a plan for Australia’s future. And I think people will see it for what it is.” The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, criticised the budget for not doing more beyond the short-term cost of living relief, saying Labor’s budget in reply speech would offer a different approach, with policies designed to improve productivity, grow the economy and boost wages. “So the difference in approach is, Labor can see beyond the May election; we think that there’s a role for investment in cleaner and cheaper energy, Tafe and training to deal with this skill shortage that we have; childcare, advanced manufacturing, the care economy … there’s a range of things which were missing from the budget which are absolutely crucial to our growth prospects going forward. We’re attentive to that even if the government’s not,” Chalmers said. Albanese’s budget in reply speech is expected to focus on health, with a plan to “strengthen Medicare” the centrepiece policy announcement. Labor has already presented policies for childcare, Tafe, advanced manufacturing and energy, as it seeks to finalise a limited suite of promises to take into the election campaign. He will give his budget in reply speech on Thursday night after the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addresses the Australian parliament. Morrison, who is expected to call the election within days after parliament rises on Thursday, rejected criticism that the budget was political in nature and designed to win back voters who have abandoned the Coalition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said the cost of living package was “necessary support” that would cement the country’s recovery out of the pandemic. “Cost of living pressures are real and Australians need that support now,” Morrison said. “We’ve got to give Australians a shield against these cost of living pressures that could frustrate and break up the momentum that the economy is building. We want Australians getting to their feet – and they are and strongly – not to be then buffeted by these strong cost of living pressures that are coming from the war in Ukraine.” But the prime minister’s budget sales pitch was overshadowed by criticism levelled at him by the NSW Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, who told the Senate on Tuesday night shortly after the budget was delivered that Morrison was “not fit” for office. Morrison dismissed the character assassination as coming from someone who had been “disappointed” after losing her spot on the NSW Senate ticket. Morrison also stumbled when asked about how the budget would help people struggling with the sky-rocketing price of rent, telling Channel Nine’s Today program that “the best way to support people renting a house is to help them buy a house.” In a post-budget speech to the national press club on Wednesday, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, committed to returning the petrol excise to its full amount at the end of the six-month reprieve, saying the measure was only intended to be temporary. “We have been very clear, only six months,” he said. He said the measure would reduce inflation by a quarter of a percentage point, and would end on 28 September when Treasury was forecasting oil prices to moderate. He also rejected suggestions the government was going to the election with the promise of an effective tax hike after reaffirming the decision to end the low and middle income tax offset this year. “It was never meant to be a permanent feature of the tax system,” he said. Frydenberg would not say how much the extra stimulus – pumped into the economy through the $5.6bn cash payments and tax boost – would add to inflation, but said the entire package was worth less than half a percentage point of GDP. “These were very temporary, targeted, responsible measures that are designed to help people at the time they need it the most,” he said.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese labels federal budget a ‘cynical exercise’ aimed only at re-election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/anthony-albanese-labels-federal-budget-a-cynical-exercise-aimed-only-at-re-election
