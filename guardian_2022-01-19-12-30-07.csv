1/19/2022,"The interval for a booster shot will be reduced to three months in Victoria and New South Wales amid unprecedented strain on hospitals as Omicron cases surge. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced on Wednesday morning the move would take effect on Wednesday while NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the change would be implemented from Friday in that state.  Perrottet said he had “seen very clearly” through ICU numbers that vaccination was key to reducing symptoms and fatalities. “I encourage everybody across our state today, who’s eligible now … to make that booking at one of our centres across the state,” he said. “It is very key to ensuring you stay safe during this pandemic.” The booster shots will be available from New South Wales’s 40 vaccine centres in a bid to speed up the rollout and fill vacant appointment slots. The change was slated for the end of the month by the commonwealth government but brought forward given the vaccine supplies available. Earlier this week, the NSW Health deputy secretary, Susan Pearce, said tens of thousands of vaccine booster appointments were going unfilled at state clinics each week. Speaking on Wednesday, she said she was relieved more people would be able to get those appointments. “Last year during the Delta outbreak, we watched them like hawks every day and we got used to seeing a very high number of vaccines being given in this state every day,” she said. “I’d really love to see that happen again now as we work our way through this latest challenge.” Andrews said the move would expand eligibility for the booster to two million more Victorians.

It’s effective … and it will help us get more people third-dose boosted quicker than would otherwise be the case.” Andrews said the number of industries with third dose vaccine mandates in place was likely to grow as eligibility expanded, while the definition of “fully vaccinated” would be changed to three vaccination doses in the weeks to come. NSW recorded 32 deaths and 32,297 Covid cases on Wednesday while Victoria had 18 Covid deaths and 20,769 cases. There are 2,863 positive cases in hospital, including 217 people in intensive care and 66 on ventilators in NSW. The rise in cases has led to staffing shortages across the healthcare sector, with dozens of intensive care nurses protesting at Westmead hospital on Wednesday morning. The hospital is one of the state’s biggest, and has been one of the priority destinations for Covid patients throughout the pandemic. “Nurses and midwives gathered today and they were really angry, with a real shared frustration because they are seeing something completely different than what the government is saying,” said NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association (NSWNWA) acting general secretary, Shaye Candish, said. “Our members are working in unsustainable conditions due to the excessive overtime, unreasonable workloads and are regularly working understaffed. “It’s causing people to cry at work. People are just at their wit’s end.” That sentiment is echoed by a senior doctor at another Sydney hospital who told Guardian Australia that one nurse broke down in tears during a video conference saying they were being told to take on more and more patients with “just no end in sight”. “Staff are literally falling apart,” this doctor said. “They are becoming walking zombies.” The hospital has given up trying to isolate Covid patients in specialised wards because they have insufficient staff and facilities. “Every day it gets worse,” the doctor said, with staff being asked to provide care beyond their skill sets. Non-ICU trained nurses, for instance, are working ICU wards, with workers relying on qualified staff to supervise those who aren’t. “Patients are not being fed, patients are not being showered, and people who are falling are not being attended to,” the doctor said. “It’s very dire.” The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he had been talking with NSWNWA representatives and would work to bring more staff onboard to ease the pressure. “I have been listening to their concerns and we are certainly considering some of the operational challenges they have inside, and certainly they have been compounded by the pandemic,” he said on Wednesday. “We’re doing everything we can.”",News/Australia news,NSW and Victoria cut Covid vaccine booster interval as Sydney nurses protest ‘unsustainable conditions’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/nsw-and-victoria-cut-covid-vaccine-booster-interval-as-sydney-nurses-protest-unsustainable-conditions
1/19/2022,"Scott Morrison has announced financial incentives to lure international workers to Australia as he continues to defend his government’s handling of the pandemic in the face of the Omicron surge. But while unveiling the $55m package that will refund the cost of visa application fees for up to 175,000 backpackers and international students, the prime minister was forced to fend off criticism of one of his backbench MPs, George Christensen, who has been calling for parents to opt out of the government’s child vaccination program.  Morrison said he was in discussion with the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, about the potential for Christensen to lose his position on parliament’s joint committee for investment and trade, which is worth an extra $20,000 to his annual salary. But otherwise, Morrison said his advice was to “simply ignore him”. “Australia is a free country, we can’t go around locking people up for what they say as Australians,” Morrison said. “He is allowed to speak his mind, but Australians shouldn’t be listening to it. “I think they’re unwise views, I think they are dangerous views, I don’t think parents should be listened to them, that is the medical advice I have from the chief medical officer and is consistent with the advice you get anywhere in the world,” he said. Morrison said parents should listen to the advice of the health experts and regulators, and said that already one in five students aged five to 11 had been vaccinated in the first 10 days of the program. The number of children vaccinated in this age bracket is expected to surpass 500,000 this week. The prime minister also faced questions about the shortage of rapid antigen tests across the country, saying Omicron had “changed everything”, and while discussions had been happening as early as June, at that stage the government’s focus was on vaccine procurement. He said the UK, which had a universal access program for rapid antigen tests, was unable to deliver on demand, and it was making no difference to the surge in case numbers in the country. “The test is not a cure, the vaccine is what protects, and that’s why we have channelled our effort into those vaccines, and that’s why one of the other areas we are working in with the workforce is targeting pop-up booster programs in a social work forces. “I understand that those rapid antigen test shortages have been a great frustration but a lot of these comments are made with hindsight, not foresight,” he said. In aged care, which is a responsibility of the federal government, Morrison said the commonwealth had begun supplying tests in August, but conceded there had not been enough. Under the details of the visa rebate program, the $630 fee for international students will be covered for the next eight weeks, and for backpackers for 12 weeks. Morrison said his message to 150,000 international students and 23,500 backpackers with visas was to “come on down”. “We want you to come to Australia and enjoy a holiday here … [and] move all the way around the country,” Morrison said. “At the same time, join our workforce and help us in our agricultural sector, in our hospitality sector, and so many of the other parts of the economy that rely on that labour.” He said international students could be willing to fill some of the critical workforce shortages being faced as a result of the Omicron surge, “particularly those who are working and being trained in healthcare, aged care, those types of sectors, that will be incredibly helpful.” The prime minister also said states that still had in place quarantine requirements for international arrivals should consider lifting them to take advantage of the additional staff arriving into the country. “I’d be encouraging them to look at those rules to make sure they can get those critical workers in,” Morrison said.He said the government was considering a further relaxation of isolation requirements down to just five days, but said it would be a “calibration” given about 30% of people remained infectious after such a short period. “At the moment that is not the advice,” he said.",News/Australia news,Australia offers visa fee refund to lure international workers and students as Morrison defends handling of pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/australia-offers-visa-fee-refund-to-lure-international-workers-and-students-as-morrison-defends-handling-of-pandemic
1/19/2022,"Scott Morrison has denied misleading Australians about whether his government is detaining refugees at a Melbourne hotel, insisting he “answered to the best of my knowledge at that time”. The prime minister on Wednesday acknowledged people recognised as refugees were among those held at the Park hotel – where tennis star Novak Djokovic was also briefly detained – but insisted he had never suggested there were no refugees there.  On Monday he told a radio host: “It’s not clear that to my information that someone in that case is actually a refugee.” Morrison came under fire over the “grossly misleading” comments, with Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, saying on Monday: “It’s an outright lie to say that these people are not refugees, when most of them have had their refugee status formally recognised for years.” Guardian Australia understands there are 25 refugees and seven asylum seekers currently held in the hotel. In an interview on Monday focused on the Djokovic case, the 2GB host Ben Fordham pointed out that the tennis star “was kept in a Melbourne hotel that also holds asylum seekers that have been denied visas”. Fordham asked: “There are refugees in that same hotel who have been detained for more than nine years, and taxpayers fork out millions of dollars to keep them in limbo. How is that acceptable?” Morrison replied: “Well, the specific cases, Ben, I mean, it’s not clear that to my information that someone in that case is actually a refugee. They may have sought asylum and been found not to be a refugee and have chosen not to return.” Morrison did not specifically concede that there were also refugees detained there. People who were not found to be refugees and who would not return home “can’t enter Australia”, he said. During a media conference in Canberra on Wednesday, Morrison was asked whether he would apologise for the comments, and whether it was appropriate that some refugees had been held in detention for more than eight years. Morrison replied: “I didn’t make a statement that every single person was, who is in that place, was not a refugee. I said that was to my understanding the case with some people who were there.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said there were “people in a range of situations” and he was “happy to add to that information”. “The suggestion that I said they were all found not to be refugees, that’s not true – that is not what I said. It was a question in a radio interview, I answered to the best of my knowledge at that time. In quite a number of cases that was indeed the case. “There were people in detention who are not owed protection under the refugee convention and our rules. Others I can tell you those who are there arrived in Australia illegally on the boat.” Under international law, it is not illegal to seek asylum. Under the Refugees Convention – to which Australia is a party – a refugee is someone who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Australia is obliged not to return refugees to places where they would face persecution, under a principle known as non-refoulement.

Morrison said the government was “not wavering” on what he thought had been a bipartisan position “that someone who illegally entered Australia by boat will not be offered permanent settlement here”. “The vast majority of people who are going through this process are actually out in the community. But there are some cases which are very sensitive and have very specific reasons as to why they would be there.” He said some of the refugees were “on the pathway to the United States” – a reference to the resettlement deal struck between the Turnbull government and the Obama administration – and he “would be encouraging them to take up that permanent option”. Mehdi, a refugee held in the Park hotel who fled Iran aged 15, arrived in Australia by boat in 2013. He has marked nine birthdays since, either in immigration detention in Australia or in offshore processing centres. His claim to refugee status was formally recognised by the Australian government in 2014. Mehdi – he only uses one name – has a “well-founded fear of being persecuted” in Iran, and he cannot legally be returned there. “I am a refugee. If I wasn’t, why would I endure such a difficult time as a child if I have the option to go back to where I came from?” Mehdi has told Guardian Australia. Pearson, of Human Rights Watch, said most of those held in the hotel had been granted refugee status after it was “established that they simply can’t return to their country”. She said Australia had a long track record of trying to cast doubt on the claims of people who seek asylum. “If you look at who’s being detained, it is men who have been shunted from one centre to another, in Australia or offshore, for more than eight years. At what point in time do you say they have suffered enough? They can’t simply continue to be used, for the rest of their lives, as a symbol of deterrence. They need to be allowed to move on with their lives.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison says he never said there were no refugees in Melbourne’s Park hotel,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/scott-morrison-says-he-never-said-there-were-no-refugees-in-melbournes-park-hotel
