4/5/2022,"‘Miaow,” says Robert Maxwell. “Miaow,” replies Ghislaine. “Miaow,” says daddy. “Miaow,” says daughter. Maxwell’s longsuffering secretary, Carol Bragoli, typing nearby, hears both sides of this conversation as Robert, being a master of the universe, always had his phone on loudspeaker so lickspittles could savour every blah. The miaowing went on for minutes and, so far as I could tell, Bragoli didn’t have a sick bucket. It’s almost impossible not to see this vignette through the prism of Succession, with Ghislaine as a precursor of Siobhan Roy, decorous daughter with no evident business skills, swanning around as though she owns the place and yearning for daddy’s validation; while daddy, when not peeing from the top-floor office of his lamestream media business on to the peasants below, barks at jellyfish underlings in his wake. There are differences. Logan Roy never had Rupert Murdoch as his nemesis, nor did he have himself memorialised vaingloriously in stained glass as Samson bringing down the walls of Gaza in the 51-bedroom mansion he rented from the council. Nor did he arrive in Britain as a refugee in 1940, work for the KGB and MI5, and serve as a Labour MP before amassing a multimillion-pound fortune. Most of all, Roy didn’t have a favourite child; still less did he name his mid-life crisis yacht after his daughter. The opening episode of The House of Maxwell (BBC Two) tacks efficiently between the night in November 1991, in waters off the Canary Islands, when Maxwell was seen alive for the last time on the Lady Ghislaine, and various key moments in his career. This documentary doesn’t test Ghislaine’s theory that her father was murdered, but rather assumes that Robert, disgrace closing in, slipped overboard, avoiding the shame of being found out to be, not a latter-day Samson, but a thief whose leveraged business empire was about to crumble. Maxwell House was once an unspeakable instant coffee in the UK; now the house of Maxwell is an unspeakable if more successful brand, whose every cough, spit and miaow is to be plundered in the way Robert did with the Mirror Group pension fund. I’m not sure this series adds much to the story set out in John Sweeney’s excellent podcast, Hunting Ghislaine, other than audio recordings of panicked lackeys wondering what will happen when their master’s body is recovered. But its confident retelling of the grisly family saga makes one wonder if daddy’s example showed his children that morality is for little people. Certainly, the tale told here of how Maxwell stymied publication of Tom Bower’s disobliging biography, which dared to depict Maxwell as a black marketeer profiting from shortages in postwar Berlin, suggests how ruthless in protecting the gilded lie Ghislaine’s father was. The series takes us from the Carpathian shtetl, in Ukraine, where Robert was born in 1923 to the Brooklyn detention centre in early 2022, where Ghislaine awaits sentencing for sex trafficking underage girls for her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein, and for others devoid of moral sense – although not Prince Andrew. Heavens, no. Eve Pollard intriguingly suggests one reason Maxwell appointed her as the Sunday Mirror’s first female editor: not out of any feminist conviction, but because she was, by definition, no threat to his dreary view of life as a competition between men. At only one moment in this opening episode does Robert Maxwell resemble a human being. Documentary film-maker Ray Errol Fox recalls interviewing Maxwell at the Yad Vashem memorial to victims of the Holocaust in Jerusalem. Maxwell spotted the name of his birthplace, Solotvina, on a wall memorialising places whose Jewish populations were murdered by the Nazis. Years before his death, Maxwell told Fox, he returned to Solotvina with his wife, Betty. “Not a single Jew was left,” Robert told Fox, as he welled up. “It was as if we never existed.” Did his epiphany in Jerusalem prompt Maxwell to take his own life? That may seem a stretch, but Fox certainly thought it significant that Maxwell was not seen in public again after attending the New York premiere of his film. Perhaps seeing himself on screen, for once shorn of pomp and sobbing with genuine emotion, made Maxwell realise that the way he had led his life was shameful. It remains a tantalising suggestion, but the likelihood of Maxwell being unable to bear being exposed as a thief and a fraud is surely the decisive factor in explaining his death. The key moments of Maxwell’s rise and fall seem inconceivable today. No oligarch now follows his business model of buying up newspapers from London to New York to Jerusalem. The establishment doesn’t ritually abase itself before moneyed moguls, as it did at Maxwell’s 65th birthday party, held at his rented mansion. Or maybe I’m being naive. The ennoblement of the oligarch press baron Evgeny Lebedev by grateful Conservative grandees suggests that the spirit of Maxwell lives on.",Arts/Television & radio,House of Maxwell review – there is only one moment where Robert resembles a human being,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/04/house-of-maxwell-review-there-is-only-one-moment-where-robert-resembles-a-human-being
4/5/2022,"Good morning. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report has highlighted the urgent but achievable actions needed to avoid catastrophic consequences of global heating, in what is in effect a final warning for governments on the climate. The report’s release comes as residents of northern NSW continue to salvage homes and businesses in the wake of repeat floods. Thirty months is the very short time the world now has for global greenhouse gas emissions to finally start to fall or face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The report from the IPCC says the world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a “now or never” dash to a low-carbon economy and society. But currently, the failure to make the changes needed will result in temperatures soaring past 3C. “The implication for Australia is clear: we need to overcome the current situation where there is merely a patchwork of mostly half-hearted policies, and absence of any policy for many aspects of the economy,” writes Frank Jotzo. Here are the key takeaways from the panel’s third report. Joe Biden has called for Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes and said he would seek more sanctions after Russian forces were accused of a “massacre” in Bucha where the bodies of unarmed Ukrainian civilians and mass graves were found on Sunday. EU leaders have denounced “massacres”, “atrocities” and “possible genocide” as the Kremlin flatly rejected all responsibility. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited Bucha on Monday where the Ukrainian leader said it had become harder for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia since ​Kyiv had become aware of the scale of alleged atrocities carried out by Russian troops. NSW Liberal MP Catherine Cusack has added her voice to a growing chorus of critics of Scott Morrison from within his own party in a scathing opinion piece for Guardian Australia. Cusack, who announced two weeks ago she would resign from the Legislative Council over her anger about flood relief, accused the prime minister of “self-serving ruthless bullying” and claims he has “ruined” the Liberal party. Cusack said Morrison had “trashed” the party’s values over two decades, as state director, “then as a scheming MP and now as prime minister finding loopholes in our constitution to delay preselections in order to get his way”. And only a quarter of Guardian Essential respondents think the Morrison government’s cash splash budget is good for them personally, and just over half (56%) think the budget’s primary purpose is to help the Coalition win the coming election. The tiny population of Victoria’s lowland Leadbeater’s possum – 33 to be exact – could face extinction within decades if translocation efforts do not succeed, after land clearing, logging and bushfires decimated the possum’s habitat of mountain ash swamps. Liberal senator Eric Abetz justified billing taxpayers $2,000 to travel to a lavish farewell gala dinner for Tony Abbott by saying the former prime minister implemented “pro-Tasmania” policies, making his attendance relevant to his home state. Hundreds of thousands of fish have died in NSW after flooding caused “severe deoxygenation” of rivers. Researchers were alarmed to discover carcasses of species that traditionally tolerate lower oxygen levels. The aged care sector has called on the major parties to spell out exactly how they plan to fund the sector to make it sustainable against the backdrop of an ageing Australian population, claiming current rules would see the pay of nursing home staff go backwards. Vladimir Putin has congratulated Viktor Orbán on his victory in Hungary’s general election, but the European Union may launch a sanctions that could switch off billions in EU payments to Budapest due to democratic backsliding. Billionaire Elon Musk bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter for almost $3bn to become the social media platform’s largest shareholder. The company’s shares soared by more than a quarter in pre-market trading on the back of the news. Pakistan remains without a government after the supreme court delayed its verdict on whether the prime minister, Imran Khan, had violated the constitution by dissolving parliament rather than face a no-confidence vote. Since forming in 1991, Australian children’s group the Wiggles have pretty much seen it all. After topping the Hottest 100 this year, the group have now topped the album charts, with a record that proves their multigenerational appeal. Murray Cook, a pre-pandemic regular on the live scene, is tickled by the validation from younger musicians. “I find it particularly satisfying that so many people I meet tell me that the Wiggles were their entrée to music. To me that’s, like, mission accomplished.” Australian standards say care labels must provide instructions adequate enough to prevent clothes from being damaged if they are followed correctly. But garment care labels can sometimes be overly cautious. So what are the rules of thumb to tell if a you can hand wash a “dry clean only” garment? Experts say you need to pay attention to the texture, treat lined clothes with caution, and keep and eye on the dye. New month – new music!
