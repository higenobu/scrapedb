3/10/2022,"Insipid with the new ball but at least determined thereafter, England began life on the road without Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad and on a stop-start second day of this first Test required the generosity of their hosts for the incisions that came their way. As the players walked off at the close West Indies were 202 from 66.5 overs, some 109 runs behind after Jonny Bairstow’s eventual 140 had stuck 311 on the board first up. Nkrumah Bonner, the late-blooming Jamaican No 4, was 34 not out from 103 balls, while Jason Holder responded to his elevation to No 6 with an unbeaten 43 from 104. Though Anderson and Broad operating in tandem away from home may be one veteran too many these days, England’s decision to omit them from this tour has cast a long shadow over their replacements and left Joe Root, a captain in desperate need of results after just one win from his last 14 matches, requiring others step up. It would be too soon to draw any hard conclusions but against weaker opposition than the Australia side which forced this drastic change, the early signs were not entirely encouraging. Chris Woakes, now the leader of the attack, found a consistent line elusive and went at over five an over for his one wicket, while Craig Overton did not offer the same threat as Ollie Robinson, whose back spasms opened up his spot. Instead it was the Durham pairing of Mark Wood and Ben Stokes who looked likeliest, enjoying reverse and conventional swing respectively. That said, the latter’s deployment for nine overs raised eyebrows over the pre-match chat that a side-strain would need to see him used sparingly. Neither are containing bowlers but at least Root had Jack Leach, who looks to be growing in confidence and enjoying drift from the Caribbean breeze. In Bonner and Holder they also met a pair of orthodox right-handers prepared to put a high price on their wickets; what follows means England need not lose heart. The names of Anderson and Broad were probably always going to linger all day and can’t have been far from the lips of England’s travelling supporters at lunch as they made their way to the various bars and jerk shacks that line the grass banks on either side of this stadium. West Indies had won the first session, knocking over the final four English wickets for a cost of 43 runs – Bairstow the last man out to a fine swirling catch from Holder – before their openers, Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell, cruised to 44 for no loss in the space of just 10 overs. England had at least passed 300 for the first time in 10 innings this winter. That said, the slightly meagre milestone was achieved thanks to Holder putting down a much simpler chance off his own bowling when Bairstow had 126 and after Jayden Seales had removed Woakes (28) and Overton (0) in the space of three deliveries. But the response that followed was not inspiring, Root forced to use four bowlers before the interval as Woakes and Overton struggled. The analysts at CricViz had this down as England’s third least threatening new-ball burst in the last decade but good old eyesight was enough here. Needless to say Anderson and Broad were in situ for the two ranked lower but on a couple of heartbreaking pitches at the MCG and the SCG during the 2017/18 Ashes tour; not a surface like this which, though slow, offered a bit of nibble with the harder ball when West Indies bowled and had a decent breeze to aid swing. This creeping dread continued into the early afternoon, Brathwaite shedding his barnacle tag with the fastest of his 33 scores above 50 in Test cricket. Last year the one of the horses he owns, War Eagle, claimed victory in the 81st Barbados Derby and the West Indies captain flew out of the traps himself with seven fours and one booming straight six off Leach. England had hit the session with fresh energy, at least, and though not every move from Root made sense – such as Woakes bowling from the Sir Curtly Ambrose End, when the breeze was going against his outswinger – they went on to claim four precious wickets, albeit chiefly through some limp batting from their hosts. First came a gift from Campbell, the aggressive Jamaican left-hander. He had just pulled Overton for a thundering four to reach 35 only to then glove a slightly shorter delivery Somerset man down leg. Then went Brathwaite, reaching for a wide, albeit 91mph delivery from Wood that was almost guided to Overton at gully like it was catching practice. Stokes then teased an edge to slip off Shamarh Brooks on 18, getting away swing from the Sir Andy Roberts End and meeting a loose drive. And though Ben Foakes had put down Jermaine Blackwood off Wood on nought – a tough chance one-handed chance down to his left from an inside edge – Woakes soon ended a personally chastening session with an inside edge off the Jamaican that flew to gully off the thigh pad. West Indies were 127 for four at tea and still 184 runs in arrears. But in between cloudbursts during the evening session Bonner and Holder toughed it out and the ball went soft. No chance was offered but Leach in particular gave Root control of the run-rate against two right-handers and got the odd one to grip in a way that at least augurs well for England come the fourth innings.",Sport/Sport,England’s new attack stutters as West Indies’ Holder and Bonner stand firm,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/west-indies-england-first-test-day-two-match-report
3/10/2022,"Carlo Ancelotti had said there was no need to go mad but no one was listening and why would they now? Suddenly there were a dozen men running down the touchline chasing Karim Benzema, the Frenchman disappearing under a pile of bodies while all round them 60,000 people completely lost their heads. The noise was so loud it made ears bleed. How they won was barely believable, maybe even the most remarkable of an entire history of implausible tales at a club that specialises in them, another astonishing comeback completed, another epic European story. They had been grateful to be only one goal down when a ridiculous gift had given them a chance and now two strikes in barely a minute had given Benzema a hat-trick that took him above Alfredo Di Stéfano in the all-time scoring charts and Madrid into the quarter-finals, somehow. There was something laughable about Madrid’s first and comic book about the second, Luka Modric running from just outside his own area all the way to PSG’s where, via Vinícius, he set up Benzema to put Madrid into the lead on the night and level on aggregate. There hadn’t even been time to digest that when they scored the third, Benzema steering past PSG, pandemonium breaking out. Their task had been made almost impossible but it was done, as are PSG, left with another failure to contemplate. One that had been unthinkable for much of a night that ended with Madrid’s players falling to their knees, history made in the most incredible manner. Ancelotti had insisted that there was no need for is team to go mad, that it didn’t matter if the goal they sought could come in the first minute or the last. He had also talked though of a desire for Madrid to play higher and they certainly needed to step out from the shelter they had inhabited in Paris, to escape their own area occasionally, and here they did start on the front foot. Vinícius, in particular, was quick to run at PSG. To concern them, too. He was away up the left twice inside the opening five minutes. Three minutes later, a superb run across the PSG area ended when he found Benzema, only for Lionel Messi to block. And then three minutes after that, Gianluigi Donnarumma had to dash out and clear against the advertising boards, immediately prompting three different ball boys to throw three different balls onto the pitch to try to get Madrid going while he was still off his line. The problem was that Messi’s block had led to a swift break that concluded with Mbappé drawing a save from Thibaut Courtois that would be just the first of many and Madrid’s early energy dissipated. That was disappointing for Ancelotti for many reasons, not least the fact that when they did occasionally succeed in pressing, PSG looked decidedly uneasy. Mostly, the visitors came to look comfortable, taking control, Messi regularly dropping in to play, seemingly at his leisure. Often it was done walking pace, until Mbappé accelerated and everyone else looked like they were going backwards. He and Neymar, twice, soon brought saves from Courtois and there were whistles as PSG’s possession became longer and longer. Ancelotti had talked about needing to be in the game at this point that felt like the best they could aspire to. Which they were and then, as if to prove he point, out of nowhere Benzema bent a sensational shot just past the far post, via Donnarumma’s fingers. That was a warning, David Alaba waving his teammates forward. But it was PSG who had the next chance, after a lovely exchange between Messi and Neymar and they thought they had he lead when Mbappé sidefootted in, only for Mendes to be ruled off side. Two more warnings came, both headers from Benzema in as many minutes, and there was a nervousness about PSG defensively, a propensity to give the ball away in compromising positions that made you wonder if they might pay for not ending this. Which they would, eventually. First though, Mbappé gave PSG the lead, Neymar’s quick ball turned into his path to run as Madrid pushed up the pitch. And when Mbappé runs there is no catching him. Setting off from inside his own half, he reached the edge of the area, looked Courtois in the eye, dipped his shoulder and smashed a shot in at the near post with an apparent ease that was almost insulting. Another chance was wasted just before half time, five blue shirts deep inside the Madrid area wanting to walk it in, meaning Madrid could it last stop this for a moment and clear their heads before it was gone entirely. It might have been when Mbappé elegantly stepped past a bamboozled Courtois without even touching the ball only for the flag to go up again. The next time he was sent dashing through, Mbappé was blocked by the dives of Militão and Alaba. Madrid though did have more of the ball now and soon had the goal transformed this place, an absurd gift from Donnarumma giving them a way back in. Caught out by Benzema, he needlessly lost possession virtually on his goal line. Vinícius collected the ball and rolled to Benzema to score. A minute later, Benzema headed just wide and the Bernabéu erupted, believing that this really could happen. Could? Would. PSG looked terrified. Now it really was set up for the kind of comeback Madrid have built a history upon.",Sport/Football,Benzema’s rapid hat-trick stuns PSG as Real Madrid pull off epic comeback,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/09/real-madrid-psg-champions-league-last-16-match-report
3/10/2022,"To the question of who would wish to be paired with Manchester City in Friday’s draw for the quarter-finals the answer is surely no one. This has been an easy canter through the group stage and last 16 to the business end of the Champions League for Pep Guardiola’s side. City reached last year’s final and few would wager they cannot do so again as there is a poise and know-how in his team that was missing when Lyon, Tottenham, Liverpool and Monaco all dumped City out in the knockout rounds of previous editions. Sporting never had a chance as their hosts had done all the heavy lifting in the opening leg three weeks ago. At 5-0 up this was the definition of an academic second leg. What Guardiola would look for, then, would be professionalism by shutting Sporting out using City’s best fluid rhythms For this quest Guardiola gave 19-year-old Conrad Egan-Riley a Champions League debut, fielding the defender at right-back in place of a suspended Kyle Walker, the manager also moving Kevin De Bruyne to the bench as he was a booking away from suspension. Sporting had been made to appear amateurish in the opening meeting so how they would approach tonight was a poser: would they try and avoid further embarrassment or might they try and hurl the proverbial kitchen sink at their hosts? The problem with the latter is City’s ability to hog possession. And if they do not have the ball it is hunted down feverishly as when Gonçalo Inácio was pickpocketed near goal by Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden was found with a pass, and Sporting were suddenly in trouble. From this moment came a Foden free-kick 20 yards out. His delivery found John Stones in the area who found Gabriel Jesus. Manuel Ugarte then seemed to bundle Jesus over and Guardiola was straight into the fourth official’s ear to ask why the referee, Halil Umut Meler, did not award a penalty. Egan-Riley’s first contribution was to skip forward and see a cross deflected out for a corner. At this point City were tapping the ball between them and Guardiola was going through his semaphore act, whirling arms as instruction to any player who might catch his eye. But, now, City’s high line was broken by Islam Slimani’s sprint from halfway and for a moment Ederson’s goal was threatened before an Aymeric Laporte leap-and-tackle killed the danger. Next, Jesus again appeared to be dumped over by Ugarte in the area but the referee was, again, not interested and this passage ended with Foden’s shot being saved by Antonio Adán. Then Slimani felled Jesus and this time Meler awarded a free-kick, sarcastic cheers were the home support’s predictable response. It was that kind of night as Sporting’s fans enjoyed themselves by running through a medley of their favourite songs accompanied by one of their contingent constantly beating a bass drum. They could cheer in anger, though, when Egan-Riley had to head clear from his area and, too, when Adán plucked Raheem Sterling’s dink from the air as it headed for goal a little later. City’s faithful thought they could be truly jubilant when Riyad Mahrez, on for the second half, ran right-to-left across Sporting’s area, slipped in Jesus who found the back of the net: VAR, though, ruled this offside much to Guardiola’s visible chagrin. James McAtee, another Champions League debutant, was Guardiola’s second half-time change and he instantly integrated, helping to knit moves together along the left, as he Fernandinho, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Jesus popped the ball about at ease. Then, with a rapid change of pace, Ilkay Gündogan beat a man and passed to McAtee who passed back and when Jesus became involved he relocated the on-running McAtee whose backheel was cute and went close to creating the opener for the Brazilian before Sebastian Coates intervened. City were not coasting – this is not in the Guardiola playbook – but they were in control, harrying Sporting, claiming the ball back, and launching measured attacks. Yet, in a rare foray upfield, a Marcus Edwards shimmy had Zinchenko tackling air though the winger’s attempt was too weak to trouble Ederson. This signalled a small period of Portuguese domination of City’s final third before, inevitably, those in sky blue again moved Sporting back into their own territory. For the final stages Guardiola gave Scott Carson a first taste of mid-week European lights for City, the goalkeeper replacing Ederson: a nice touch from his manager who ended content despite Sterling’s late, point-blank miss.",Sport/Football,VAR denies Jesus but Manchester City stroll past Sporting with total control,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/09/manchester-city-sporting-champions-league-last-16-match-report
3/10/2022,"Eddie Jones will hold a crucial training session on Thursday morning before finalising his England team to face Ireland with Kyle Sinckler understood to be among the players hampered by injury or illness this week. Sinckler is believed to be managing a back problem and did not take part in Tuesday’s training session, instead limited to exercises away from the pitch. Wednesday was due to be the players’ recovery day but Sinckler was put through his paces alone in a bid to ready himself. Jones will name his team after Thursday’s full-on session and while Sinckler is expected to take part he will no doubt be monitored closely. Joe Heyes was retained in a 26-man group as the third tighthead prop and Will Stuart is standing by for the No 3 jersey if Sinckler suffers a setback. While there is a degree of optimism Sinckler will be deemed fit, his absence would be a huge blow as England seek to keep their hopes of the Six Nations title alive and his interrupted training week comes as a further headache for Jones regardless. Tom Curry has had to pass through the return to play protocols before returning to full training and Thursday’s training session is also set to determine whether Alex Dombrandt can take his place in the 23-man squad after the No 8 tested positive for Covid-19 last week. Dombrandt will have to come through rigorous testing in order to prove himself ready but both Joe Marler and Joe Marchant have recently come straight back into the matchday squad soon after emerging from isolation. A place on the bench may be most likely for Dombrandt, however, with Sam Simmonds in the frame to start at No 8 and with Jones thought to be considering loading his replacements bench with six forwards, Alfie Barbeary could be in line for a debut. The 21-year-old was kept on as part of the wider 26-man squad and would offer considerable gainline punch – something England have lacked in recent weeks – if he was part of the matchday 23. Elsewhere, Jones is likely to largely stick by the side who beat Wales, though Jamie George is set to come in at hooker with Luke Cowan-Dickie sidelined for the rest of the tournament. Marchant may also supplant Elliot Daly at outside centre, having been called up as a late replacement against Wales following Manu Tuilagi’s withdrawal through injury. Joe Launchbury is expected to feature in the squad for the first time in 15 months but Charlie Ewels is hoping he retains the starting jersey alongside Maro Itoje in the second row. He and Itoje were in the same under-18s side who overcame Ireland in an age-grade final back in 2012 with Ewels recently posting a picture of them both on social media. He said: “I was in his shadow back then, and I still am now! He was very similar to how he is now – clever, he’d just taken a scholarship at Harrow, he played the same way that he plays now, big, abrasive ball-carrier, getting stuck in. He’s just a heightened version of what he was back then. In games we have a greater understanding of each other and each of our strengths and weaknesses.” Meanwhile, the RFU has confirmed it will fly the Ukraine flag alongside the England and Ireland colours at Twickenham on Saturday.",Sport/Sport,Sinckler injury disrupts England plans for Six Nations showdown with Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/sinckler-injury-disrupts-england-plans-for-six-nations-showdown-with-ireland
3/10/2022,"Josh Navidi will return to the Wales starting XV after a year’s absence, one of four changes Wayne Pivac has made for the visit of France on Friday night in the Six Nations. On the other flank, Seb Davies will add noticeable heft to the back row. Jonathan Davies brings 95 Tests of experience at inside-centre while Gareth Thomas starts for just the second time at loosehead prop. Navidi’s last appearance for his country came in the 32-30 Six Nations defeat in Paris in March 2021 where he scored a try. However, a recurring shoulder injury, first sustained in April and then exacerbated in October, has stalled his progress. He played all 80 minutes in his comeback match last Friday in Cardiff Blues’ 48-12 loss to Ulster, offering all the evidence Pivac needed for his selection. “Certain players can do this and he has a history of stepping up,” the Wales coach said, citing Navidi’s 68 minutes against Ireland last year which was not preceded by any club rugby. “He’s ready to go and we’re very pleased to have him back. “We looked at the England game and in our review [of the 23-19 loss last month] we looked at some of the errors we made and some of the penalties we gave away. Wales: L Williams; A Cuthbert, O Watkin, J Davies, J Adams; D Biggar (cap), T Williams; G Thomas, R Elias, T Francis, W Rowlands, A Beard, S Davies, J Navidi, T Faletau. Replacements: D Lake, W Jones, D Lewis, R Moriarty, J Morgan, K Hardy, G Anscombe, L Rees-Zammit. France: M Jaminet; Y Moefana, G Fickou, J Danty, G Villiere; R Ntamack, A Dupont (cap); C Baille, J Marchand, U Atonio, C Woki, P Willemse, F Cros, A Jelonch, G Alldritt. Replacements: P Mauvaka, JP Gros, M Haouas, T Flament, D Cretirn, M Lucu, T Ramos, M Lebel. “Then we look at the experience of a guy like Josh brings and his decision-making in those areas of the game. “He’s close to 30 Test matches and was a big part of our success last year in the Six Nations. It’s great from our point of view.” Pivac credited Navidi’s ability to supply go-forward ball with strong carries as well as aggression on the ground. He cannot do it on his own, however, and Seb Davies’s selection over Taine Basham – who drops out of the match-day 23 – was motivated by the considerable size of the French pack. “He offers us something different in terms of the balance in the lineout,” Pivac said of the 1.98m (6ft 6in) loose forward. “He’s got a good skill-set when he is on the edges.” Since taking the Wales job in 2019, Pivac has yet to name an unchanged team in 25 matches. He said that this tinkering was not part of a grand, experimental design but rather the consequence of a spate of injuries. “We’d like to get some continuity in selection,” he said. Nick Tompkins is unavailable after suffering from a concussion playing for Saracens in their victory over Leicester on Saturday and is replaced by Jonathan Davies who will partner Owen Watkin in midfield. The back three at least remains unchanged and is bolstered by Louis Rees-Zammit on the bench. The 21-year-old wing was dropped for the game against England but impressed with Gloucester, scoring a try against Northampton on Saturday after coming on as a substitute. France’s general manager, Raphaël Ibañez, downplayed the favourites tag attached to his team for this encounter, but there is no doubt that it is deserved. Their quest for a second successive win in Cardiff is bolstered by Antoine Dupont’s fitness after the French captain brushed off a suspected arm injury he picked up in training. “He’s world class,” Pivac said. “Probably the form player in the world. Even when you’re sitting in the opposition coach’s box, some of the things he does, you find yourself just saying: ‘Well done.’ He’s great to watch. Hopefully we’ll be able to contain him.” Wing Damian Penaud and second row Romain Taofifénua will miss the match after testing positive for Covid-19 and the coach, Fabien Galthié, has admitted that more changes may be necessary by the time the opening whistle sounds.",Sport/Sport,Josh Navidi returns for Wales to face France after year on the sidelines,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/josh-navidi-returns-wales-to-face-france-after-year-on-sidelines-six-nations
3/10/2022,"Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Brazil’s capital after one of the country’s leading musicians, Caetano Veloso, called a major protest to denounce what environmentalists call a historic assault on the Brazilian environment under President Jair Bolsonaro. The “Ato pela Terra” (Stand for the Earth) demonstration was held in Brasília to oppose what activists call a “death combo” of five environment-related bills being considered by Brazil’s congress. The senate is expected to vote on three of those bills in the coming weeks, while two are expected to face votes in the lower house. If approved, the proposals would greenlight commercial mining on indigenous lands and jeopardize the land rights of tens of thousands of indigenous people; loosen environmental licensing requirements and regulations over pesticide use; and boost land grabbers and illegal loggers in the Amazon, where deforestation has soared under Brazil’s far-right president. “It’s ecocide,” said Janaína Fernandes, a 49-year-old jeweller who was among those who had turned out to voice anger at the assault on Brazil’s environment that followed Bolsonaro’s 2018 election. Veloso, who was joined at the rally outside congress by celebrities including the rapper Emicida, the actor Lázaro Ramos and the singer Daniela Mercury, urged citizens to fight legislation that posed “a clear threat to the environment”. “I think it’s time for us to get out on to the streets and to show our faces,” said the 79-year-old songwriter. “I’m optimistic about the future of Brazil. That’s to say, I’m taking action to foster something new here, something that might enlighten the world,” Veloso told the Guardian. “But right now it’s hard to cling on to this mindset.” Addressing members of congress before the rally, Veloso said Brazil had reached its most critical environment crossroads since the return of democracy in the 1980s. “Amazon deforestation is out of control … our international credibility has been shattered,” he said, urging politicians to reject the five bills. Ana Carolina Tessmann, a 31-year-old teacher, said she was marching against “the worst and cruelest” moment in Brazilian history. “I understand that it is my obligation as a citizen to actively take part in these protests,” Tessmann said. Protesters hope to convince lawmakers to reject or modify the bills – which have the support of the powerful agribusiness lobby – to reflect concerns over the climate emergency and the traditional populations affected by environmental destruction. “We want to tell [congress] that we will not accept this … If some of these bills pass, they will spell our destruction,” said Txai Suruí, 25, an indigenous activist from Rondônia, an Amazon state that is a deforestation hotspot. Marcio Astrini, an environmentalist who is one of the event’s organizers, warned the five pieces of proposed legislation could have devastating consequences for Brazil’s environment and the global climate. “The protest’s message is: do not vote for these bills in their current form because they are a disaster,” said Astrini, the executive director of the Climate Observatory. “They doom the country, they doom the environment, they doom our international reputation and they put the survival of the Amazon – and thus the Paris agreement targets – at risk.” Environmentalists fear that if the bills become law, they will enshrine Bolsonaro’s anti-environmental policies into law for years to come – even if he fails to secure a second term in this year’s election. Polls suggest Bolsonaro will lose October’s election to his leftwing rival, the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, having appalled many voters with his anti-scientific handling of a Covid pandemic, which has killed more than 650,000 Brazilians. But by then, Astrini warned, long-lasting damage to the environment might already have been done. “Even if we change the president and we change Brazil’s environmental stewardship, these [new] rules would make it very hard to fight environmental crime,” he said. “It would be like taking all of the harm being done by the government today, and ensuring it will continue causing harm and deforestation for years and decades to come.” Bruna Brelaz, the 27-year-old head of Brazil’s national union of students, urged the country’s youth to make its voice heard in this year’s election. “Register to vote and get Bolsonaro out,” she told demonstrators. “This is the calling of our generation – and it is this generation that will get rid of Bolsonaro and transform this country.”",News/World news,Thousands protest against Brazil’s ‘death combo’ of anti-environment bills,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/brazil-protest-environment-indigenous-bolsonaro
