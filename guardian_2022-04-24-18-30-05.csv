4/24/2022,"It would be easy to write off this revival of Emlyn Williams’s semi-autobiographical drama as an example of post-lockdown “comfort theatre”. First performed in the West End in 1938, this tale of a talented Welsh miner’s son and his inspirational teacher is laced with sentimentality and tweeness. There is even a lilting choir of singing miners whose presence seems orchestrated to tug at our emotions. But if it is comfort viewing, it is undeniably artful, affecting and hugely entertaining. At its centre is the impoverished, illiterate Morgan Evans (Iwan Davies), whose teacher, Miss Moffat (Nicola Walker) gets him “over the wall” of his limited horizons and all the way to Oxford University. Evans is a Billy Elliot of the Valleys, of sorts, though the indomitable Miss Moffatt gives him lessons in Greek and Latin instead of dance. Williams’ story may be sentimentalised but is worth remembering as a social history of the more unbendable days of British class privilege, and also of how generations of working-class school children broke through class barriers thanks to a grammar school education. Dominic Cooke’s revival deploys a quirky theatrical device in which the playwright, Williams (Gareth David-Lloyd), is a character on stage who is constructing his story before the audience. This device cannot quite disguise the old-fashioned nature of the story or dampen its sentimentality, but it brings clever humour and is beguiling in its own right. The drama begins with an initially empty stage in a self-conscious game of make-believe, though Ultz’s set design gradually gathers its playfulness. There are Christopher Shutt’s crisp, hammy sound effects in lieu of props or set at the beginning – creaking for nonexistent doors that open as characters step on to the stage; the sound of a spoon in a china cup when a character drinks an invisible cup of tea. Actors never leave when they exit a scene but sit with their backs to the audience on the stage floor. There are other edgy elements, such as the choir’s sooty faces, which are disturbingly reminiscent of blackface and point to the othering of working-class lives. Cooke’s direction is supremely well-paced and all of the performers have impeccable comic timing. Walker is delightful to watch, both in her angry exchanges with the supercilious Squire (Rufus Wright, excellently doltish), which bring sparky satire, and in her initially brusque attitude towards Davies’s sweet, laconic Evans. Miss Moffat is a bold, bossy, self-proclaimed spinster with oodles of no-nonsense charm. “I have never spoken to any man without wanting to box his ears,” she says. She’s a Henry Higgins figure, but develops darker shades. There is a zealous focus on the star student (she calls him “my little pit pony”) she is training for Oxford, but she sends the depressed young Bessie (Saffron Coomber, broodingly sublime) to a life of service, writing her off as “one of my failures” because she does not excel in lessons. Miss Moffat has developed a potential for tyranny by the time a drunk Evans confronts her about her autocratic, unfeeling style of pedagogy. It is a shame that the play does not develop this further, but quickly irons out the tension between them and returns to the clear, simple narrative that Evans wants to better himself. Their bust-up has shown otherwise, and he speaks poignantly of his desire not to be a bookish oddity in his muscular, working-class pit town, but to fit in. Our hearts do soar and melt, though, as the gifted Evans navigates his way towards a happy ending, and there are lovely, warm laughs along the way. This revival is a reminder that old stories, when they are good, stay that way, however riddled they are with nostalgia.

4/24/2022,"A fierce battle for campaign territory has forced TV presenters Mariella Frostrup and Davina McCall into a tactical retreat. After a tussle with a bestselling author, Frostrup has reluctantly changed the name of a website she set up with McCall, Labour MP Carolyn Harris, model Penny Lancaster, journalist Kate Muir and medical experts, to campaign for greater awareness of the impact of the menopause. The campaigners had called their online women’s health project The Menopause Manifesto, but Jennifer Gunter, the US gynaecologist and author of a book of the same name, published last spring, strongly objected. “Basically, as far as I’m concerned, the cause is bigger than a name, so we changed the name,” said Frostrup. “We want to improve the menopause experience for women who need things to change, we want the UK government to honour their promises to women. It’s immaterial what we’re called, what matters is what we are about.” The site will now be called the Menopause Mandate. Gunter, who also wrote The Vagina Bible, was not placated by Frostrup’s suggestion they were waging the same war. Gunter was dismayed, she said, to find that Frostrup’s campaign site, set up as a practical response to the ideas in a book she recently co-wrote, Cracking the Menopause, had chosen the same name. “It is unacceptable that you have used the name of my book,” tweeted Gunter this weekend. “Many people involved with your organiszation [sic] know it is the name of my book. ” Gunter’s book debunks many of the myths about menopause, as well as offering aid and information. It has earned some good reviews, with the New Scientist judging that her guide “to counteracting medical misogyny” offers “women strength, value, agency and knowledge to help them through this transition in their life”. Gunter has also won passionate defenders among her readers. One of them is Fiona Dolman, who tweeted in support. “You cant research menopause without @DrJenGunter excellent book coming up. Why did you decide it was OK to used the title without asking? How disappointing.” Frostrup and her team backed down, but not without some resistance: “It is a book title, not a global corporation!” said Frostrup on Twitter. “We are no[sic] competing, we are a not-for-profit advocacy group. Talk about sweating the small stuff. You know what they say about publicity by the way?” She added: “We will change the name of our website but I am sad for you that you would be so territorial about an issue that impacts all women’s lives. No one “owns” the words menopause or manifesto. Or their combined use. We should be united, not fighting.” Frostrup and her fellow crusaders, who are “real women, campaigners, politicians, menopause experts, celebrities and journalists”, are aiming to increase pressure on the UK government to improve access to hormone replacement therapy and promote greater understanding of the impact of menopause. The group’s supporters includes TV presenters Gabby Logan and Lisa Snowden. The website urges readers to “join the menocause” and demand help for millions of “peri- and post-menopausal women in the UK” arguing that “for millennia menopause has been off the map”. Due to “tireless campaigning”, the message continues, “It’s the biggest women’s issue of the moment.” Frostrup noticed that many of those who had encouraged her not to give ground, with “less conciliatory responses”, were men. One of them, Charlie Davies, wrote: “Don’t be bullied into changing your name because it happens to be the name of a book in America. You are UK-based and menopause is a global issue. Stand firm!”",News/Media,"Mariella Frostrup, her menopause site… and a blazing row with a US author",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/24/mariella-frostrup-her-menopause-site-and-a-blazing-row-with-a-us-author
4/24/2022,"Truly, we live in parlous economic times. For proof, consider the warning from the International Monetary Fund last week: “The sovereign bank nexus could lead to a self-reinforcing adverse feedback loop that could force the government into default”, calling the process a “doom loop”. Bewildering or what? I know economists are a rarefied breed, but they’re not doing themselves any favours when they dish up warnings like this. Mind you, “doom loop” is sensible shorthand. After all, consider its full meaning: “The doom loop is the circle of vulnerability where a country’s banking system can be severely hurt by volatility in the price of the sovereign bonds they hold for reserves resulting in a contraction in lending provided by the banks.” As for George Freeman, a science minister, commenting on partygate and the fixed penalty notices issued to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, he said: “So I’m pleased that the PM and the chancellor have issued fulsome apologies, which is absolutely right.” Mr Freeman, consider the definition: “Complimentary or flattering to an excessive degree.” I am grateful to Ian Dutch for the following: “Applicants for a counterterror check needed for an ‘airside’ airport pass, will be ‘expedited up the pipeline’ by the UK Security Vetting (UKSV).” I’m further grateful to David Darwin for: “Kwasi Kwarteng is reported today as saying about Rishi Sunak and his wife that they had been ‘incredibly transparent’ about her non-domicile tax arrangement.

4/24/2022,"Eight years ago, when Whitney Goodman was a newly qualified therapist counselling cancer patients, it struck her that positive thinking was being “very heavily pushed”, both in her profession and the broader culture, as the way to deal with things. She wasn’t convinced that platitudes like “Look on the bright side!” and “Everything happens for a reason!” held the answers for anyone trying to navigate life’s messiness. Between herself, her friends and her patients, “All of us were thinking, ‘Being positive is the only way to live,’ but really it was making us feel disconnected and, ultimately, worse.” This stayed with her and, in 2019, she started an Instagram account, @sitwithwhit, as a tonic to the saccharine inspirational quotes dominating social media feeds. Her posts included: “Sometimes things are hard because they’re just hard and not because you’re incompetent…” and “It’s OK to complain about something you’re grateful for.” It took off: the “radically honest” Miami-based psychotherapist now has more than 500,000 followers. Goodman’s new book, Toxic Positivity, expands on this thinking, critiquing a culture – particularly prevalent in the US and the west more broadly – that has programmed us to believe that optimism is always best. She traces its roots in the US to 19th-century religion, but it has been especially ascendant since the 1970s, when scientists identified happiness as the ultimate life goal and started rigorously researching how to achieve it. More recently, the wellness movement – religion for an agnostic generation – has seen fitness instructors and yogis preach about gratitude in between burpees and downward dogs. We all practise it in some way. When comforting a friend, we turn into dogged silver-lining hunters. And we lock our own difficult thoughts inside tiny boxes in a corner of our brains because they’re uncomfortable to deal with and we believe that being relentlessly upbeat is the only way forward. Being positive, says Goodman, has become “a goal and an obligation”. Toxic Positivity is among a refreshing new wave of books attempting to redress the balance by espousing the power of “negative” emotions. Their authors are hardly a band of grouches advocating for us to be miserable. But they’re convinced that leaning into – rather than suppressing – feelings, including regret, sadness and fear brings great benefit. The road to the good life, you see, is paved with tears and furrowed brows as well as smiles and laughter. “I think a lot of people who focus on happiness, and the all-importance of positive emotions, are getting human psychology wrong,” says Paul Bloom, a psychology professor at Yale and the author of The Sweet Spot, which explores why some people seek out painful experiences, like running ultra marathons and watching horror movies. “In a life well lived, you should have far fewer negative than positive emotions, but you shouldn’t have zero negative emotions,” adds Daniel Pink, the author of The Power of Regret. “Banishing them is a bad strategy.” The timing of these new works – which also include Helen Russell’s podcast (following her book of the same name) How To Be Sad – is no coincidence. In light of the pandemic and now the conflict in Ukraine, it seems trite to suggest a positive outlook is all we need. Strong negative emotions – fear, anxiety and sadness – are a natural response to what’s happening around the world right now and we shouldn’t have to deny them. These authors want you to know that “negative” emotions are, in fact, helpful. Russell talks about sadness being a “problem-solving” emotion. Research from the University of New South Wales shows that it can improve our attention to detail, increase perseverance, promote generosity and make us more grateful for what we’ve got. “It’s the emotion that helps us connect to others,” she adds. “We’re nicer, better people in some ways when we are sad.” It’s tougher making an argument for regret, which might be the world’s most maligned emotion, but Pink is game. From a young age we are instructed to never waste energy on regrets. The phrase “No regrets” is inked into arms and on to bumper plates and T-shirts. Seemingly every famous person has a quip about living without regrets (I would know: as someone who tends to linger on thoughts of what might have been, I’ve read them all). Pink says we’re getting it all wrong. “A ‘No regrets’ tattoo is like having a tattoo that says ‘No learning’,” says Pink, who was also a speechwriter for Al Gore, speaking from Dallas, Texas. He became interested in this topic because he couldn’t shake his own regrets about the fact that, while a university student, he wasn’t kind to fellow pupils excluded at social events. “If it has bothered me for a month, a year, or in this case 20 years, that’s telling me: ‘Hey, you might not realise it, but you care about kindness,’” he says. “Regrets clarify what matters to us and teach us how to do better. That’s the power of this emotion – if we treat it right.” The problem? We’re not taught how to effectively process these difficult emotions. A good starting point is to familiarise ourselves with these feelings by acknowledging them and sitting with them for a beat. That takes practice, says Goodman. “It can include learning how your emotions feel in your body, and what to call them. When we’re able to put a name to a feeling, it makes it less scary. And when something is known, we can figure out what we want to do with it.” Telling others about it lightens the weight. Complaining is perfectly natural, says Goodman. And articulating it helps us pinpoint what it is that’s bothering us, because language converts this “menacing cloud” into “something concrete”, says Pink. That disclosure could be to a friend, therapist or total stranger. In his Regret Survey, 18,000 people anonymously shared their biggest regrets, while Russell suggests a “buddy” system, in which you make a reciprocal agreement with someone to talk about your worries without interruption. (A note, if you are comforting a friend: listen and ask questions rather than immediately reaching for pick-me-ups.) Your next step will likely depend on the nature – and severity – of the emotion. To help us sit with sadness, Russell advocates being in nature. Cultural pursuits can help, too. “It sounds a little ‘woo’, but there are lots of studies about the effectiveness of reading therapy and looking at a piece of art – and how music can change our moods,” she says. “Sad music can act as a companion when we’re feeling sad, rather than making us feel lower. I do think it’s liberating when you finally kind of surrender to it all.” Pink, whose approach is a little more structured, differentiates between regrets of action (wrongs you’ve committed) and inaction (opportunities not seized). For both, you must comfort yourself with the knowledge that everyone has regrets – and recognise that that single thing doesn’t define you. “Don’t look at a mistake as St Peter at the gate passing final judgment on your worth,” he says, but as “a teacher trying to instruct you.” He recommends stepping outside yourself and considering what you would recommend a friend do in a similar situation, whether that’s making amends for past acts, grasping a new opportunity, or ensuring you don’t make a similar misstep in the future. Crucially, processing negative emotions “should all feel somewhat productive in the end”, says Goodman. Meaning: instead of ending up in a funk of wallowing, with your feelings replaying on a loop, “the wheels are turning, you’re making connections, you’re figuring things out,” she says. That doesn’t mean you need to come out of it feeling happy, or with a neat fix. “Sometimes you just get to a place where you say, ‘That was really hard, and now it’s over or now I’m not dealing with that any more’,” says Goodman. “And if it comes up for me again, I’ll deal with it.” Leaning into negative thoughts should ultimately leave you with a sense of fulfilment. While we might instinctively think that filling our days solely with joy and excitement is the dream, “if we want to live a meaningful and purposeful life, a lot of pain is going to be part of it”, says Bloom. “What I really want is for people to be able to enjoy the full range of the human experience,” adds Goodman. Armed with the knowledge that you can do it in a methodical way, don’t be afraid to let the darkness in.

4/24/2022,"Edward de Bono, the late philosopher, author and bestselling mental strategist, was famous for solving problems in an unconventional manner. Indeed, he actually invented the term lateral thinking in 1967. But the publication of De Bono’s final work, his last will and testament, has posed several unexpected questions that might test even the most creative mind. De Bono, who was always assumed to have been a very wealthy man due to the success of his self-help empire and international network of courses, in fact appears to have died last summer in his native Malta at the age of 88 with much less money than expected – only a few thousand pounds – at his disposal. The author of 68 books had also taken time to ask his lawyers to make sure that his former co-author Daniela Bartoli, a philosophy student and for a decade the chief executive of his foundation, would not benefit in any way from his estate. When his will was released last month, it was revealed that De Bono’s estate had just £11,900 in it. Despite regularly being referred to as a one-man global industry and having institutions and foundations set up under his name, the philosopher’s personal fortune appears to have been a myth. De Bono, who was born in Floriana, Malta in 1933, was nicknamed “Genius” at school, skipping two academic years, and in his youth won a Rhodes scholarship to study for a master’s degree in psychology and physiology at Christ Church, Oxford. In midlife his genius seemed to be as much for marketing as for his counterintuitive theories. He retired to his family home in the Maltese town of Rabat after a prolific writing career. His best-known works are The Use of Lateral Thinking, Parallel Thinking, Six Thinking Hats and Six Action Shoes. Among his more eccentric theories was the idea that Marmite, that infamously divisive substance, could be used to solve the Middle East conflict. He believed the antagonism between Arabs and Israelis could be solved by the pots of spread because people in the region customarily eat unleavened bread, without zinc, and so are irritable and belligerent. De Bono reasoned that eating yeast extract might achieve peace. “Mine is a rare, undocumented and unlabelled profession,” he once said. “Bookshops always have difficulty with my books because they don’t know whether to put me under humour, business, philosophy or psychology.” One of his most idiosyncratic books, The Love of Two Cockroaches, was his first and only literary approach to questions of love and lust. The book, written in 2009 with Bartoli, was an allegorical tale in the form of a conversation between “two ordinary cockroaches”, Mitsa and Matok. The suggestion was that even something as unlovely as these insects can be capable of emotional attachment and attraction. “Nobody seems to like cockroaches,” the book begins. “They scurry about their lives doing no harm to anyone but are universally disliked and killed on sight.” When this illustrated volume, for “mature children”, was launched a book signing at a hotel in Malta in February 2010, art critics and academics made speeches in praise of the collaboration. Yet, 12 years on, it is clear that there was a parting of ways. De Bono added a clause to his will “expressly excluding” Bartoli from benefiting from his estate “in any manner whatsoever”. Bartoli now lives and works in Paris, according to her business profile, which says she worked as De Bono’s executive assistant for 14 years. The Observer was unable to reach her. De Bono’s will shows he had intended to make a retirement gift of £40,000 to his former personal assistant, Patricia “Paddy” Hills, made on condition that Hills agreed she had no other claim on his estate and fully complies with his executors, and presumably on the basis that in 2018, when he drew it up, he believed his estate would be able to afford it. “She is very good and I look upon her as my general manager,” De Bono was quoted as saying. “She does not type letters, which I do myself, but she organises meetings and is constantly on the phone, making sure that I am at the right place at the right time. She is calm and low key. If she were not, my life would be even more frenetic.” Hills herself said she was constantly on call. “My mobile phone and paperwork go with me, even on holidays and weekends. This is definitely not a nine-to-five job and the days just blend in, but I enjoy it and I am glad to have provided the continuity.” In the light of the gift to Hills, there is ambiguity about what De Bono’s various legatees may actually receive. Further surprises in the will include the identity of his children. De Bono, who married Josephine Hall White in 1971, was thought to have had two children, but his will names four. The document leaves his limited remaining estate to be shared between his sons Caspar and Charles de Bono, and another son, Edward Szekely, also known as Edward de Bono, the son of Magdalena Szekely, and with a daughter, Juliana Pars. This daughter, now living in London and studying at Cambridge University, is named as the daughter of Donna Pars. The will adds to the mysteries of the author’s life, something once hinted at by Hills. She warned Piers Dudgeon, her employer’s biographer: “hat you are going to find through your research is a great sense of warmth from various people, and energy, but they are not going to be able to hold the butterfly for you or pin things down. When you try to get a neat order around him you won’t be able to.”",News/Education,The father of lateral thinking pulls posthumous tricks out of his hat,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/24/the-father-of-lateral-thinking-pulls-posthumous-tricks-out-of-his-hat
4/24/2022,"In 2004, Mario Cibelli was preparing a 75-year-old patient for a big cardiac operation when the patient’s daughter asked for a quick word. “She explained to me how worried she was about the surgery,” says Cibelli, a consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care at the University Hospitals Birmingham. “I said: ‘Look, everybody’s worried about heart surgery, it comes with risks, but normally people benefit from it.’ And then she told me that her father had undergone a cardiac procedure two years before and he had changed dramatically.” Cibelli listened as the woman described how her father, a former physics professor, had shown signs of significant cognitive decline after the initial operation. Once a keen chess player, he was now unable to play the game and struggled to even do basic crosswords. For Cibelli, it was the first time he had encountered what is now termed postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) – cognitive problems associated with surgery that persist well after the effects of anaesthetics have worn off. “I published some articles on the subject,” he says. “And people began finding my email address, saying their father or mother had changed a lot after a surgery in the past. So I began to realise that this wasn’t such an isolated case.” We have known for a long time that operations can have hidden consequences for the brain. As far back as 1887, the British Medical Journal published a paper describing cases of delirium after surgery with anaesthesia. A century later, scientists in the 1980s began to look at cases of older patients who had shown a decline in memory and concentration after cardiac surgery, but it has only been more recently that this has become apparent as a risk factor for all over-65s who undergo surgery, especially when under deep sedation. In the last 20 years, studies have shown that POCD symptoms can affect everything from memory to attention, judgment and perception, and those with pre-existing health conditions are especially vulnerable. One survey of patients who received surgery to repair hip fractures found that those who developed POCD had a poorer ability to function socially and carry out normal activities such as writing, managing money or remembering lists, with a tangible impact on their daily life. At the moment, estimates suggest that the overall incidence of POCD in older patients can be as high as 50-80% at discharge, 20-50% at six weeks and 10-30% at six months post-surgery. Given that the NHS carries out about 5.1m operations every year, a disproportionate number of which are in the over-65s, Cibelli says that there are a considerable number of patients being left with lasting impairment. In recent years, POCD has caught the attention of Alzheimer’s researchers, intrigued to see whether it can accelerate decline towards dementia in some cases. Jenny Barnett, chief executive of Monument Therapeutics, a Cambridge-based biotech startup developing new therapies in neurology, says that people who already have underlying impairments in memory and attention skills are particularly vulnerable to POCD and it needs to be considered as a risk factor before significant surgeries. “Many of us have had the experience of granny breaking her hip, goes into hospital and then by the time she comes out, she isn’t the same cognitively and isn’t able to live independently any more,” says Barnett. “I think that’s something that resonates with a lot of people.” But exactly what causes POCD remains something of a mystery. Some point the finger at anaesthetics – certain animal studies have found that inhalation anaesthetics, the most commonly used form of general anaesthesia, can cause degradation of the cholinergic system in the brain, which is involved in learning and memory – but it has proven hard to study this in humans. Instead, many scientists are pinpointing the possibility that these symptoms arise through the body’s reaction to surgery itself. Big operations unleash a firestorm of inflammation in response to the acute tissue damage that can cross the blood-brain barrier. Because the brain contains the largest density of inflammatory receptors in the body, it is especially vulnerable to the effects of inflammation, which can damage sensitive regions. Some brain-imaging scans have found that the hippocampus – a complex and vulnerable structure that plays a key role in memory – has a reduced volume in patients with POCD. All this emerging evidence could lead to changes in medical practice. Research is already taking place into ways of identifying at-risk patients before operations, with the idea of potentially using a regional rather than a general anaesthetic. But it is not only older, frailer patients who are most at risk of POCD. The same can be said for the very young, in a markedly different way. As a paediatric anaesthetist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, David Warner had been attempting to understand the possible causes of a wide range of behavioural issues in children. He began to wonder whether surgery and anaesthesia could affect the fragile brains of young children. “I go into hospital in the morning and I take care of kids during surgery, and they wake up and they go home at night, and they seem to be fine,” he says. “So for a long time, we just assumed that anaesthesia was very transient, so when it wears off, it’s gone. That’s probably not true.” The reason why Warner became concerned about anaesthetics is because in studies of monkeys, anaesthesia exposure in infancy has led to altered behaviours such as heightened emotional reactivity to threats, and impaired learning and memory formation. However it is difficult to translate these changes to humans, in whom child development is far more complex than in our closest relatives. In 2018, Warner decided to put his theories to the test. He carried out a study on 1,000 children in Minnesota and compared three groups: children who had not been exposed to anaesthesia before the age of three; children who had a single exposure; and children who had multiple exposures. “Basically, we found that kids who had multiple exposures to anaesthesia had these problems with their fine motor skills and increased reports of behavioural problems,” he says. Other investigations have also found an association between multiple exposures to anaesthetics before the age of three and cognitive, memory, listening comprehension, and language deficits. Further studies have found correlations between multiple exposures to anaesthetics and children later being given a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). But so far it has been hard for scientists to prove a direct causative relationship between anaesthetics and damage to the developing brain. In 2019, a study in the Lancet pointed out that there could be alternative explanations. Children who require multiple operations at a young age could already be predisposed to neurodevelopmental problems because of the injuries or illnesses they are suffering from: the doses of anaesthetics may be merely incidental. Right now, we do not know, but later this year, Warner will be carrying out brain-imaging scans on the same children to see whether structural changes in the brain related to anaesthesia can be linked with the onset of behavioural issues. “We have some preliminary evidence that there’s something different in a particular part of the brain in the kids who had multiple anaesthetic exposures,” he says. “That’s just our initial look at this, but I suspect that there’s going to be something there.” In 2015, the American Society of Anaesthesiologists launched the Brain Health Initiative to raise more attention about the issue of cognitive problems in the aftermath of surgery. Warner feels that the growing awareness of these risks means that doctors will be increasingly cautious of using anaesthetics on young children when conducting non-surgical procedures, such as radiotherapy or endoscopy. He says it is clear that there needs to be a greater focus on the longer-term care of children who have had multiple anaesthetics in the early stages of life. The brains of young children are highly malleable, or “plastic”, as neuroscientists like to say, and Warner suggests providing such vulnerable children with specific cognitive enrichment activities to stimulate them, as a protection against cognitive impairments. At the other end of the age spectrum, increasing amounts of attention are being devoted towards ways of either preparing older patients for surgeries to make them more cognitively resilient, or treating POCD in the aftermath. In the early 1990s, the Danish surgeon Henrik Kehlet created a programme known as ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery) to study ways of maximising postoperative recovery. Some of the latest research suggests that a “prehabilitation” programme consisting of simple muscle exercises, nutritional supplements and education to stimulate the mind over a period of six to eight weeks before big operations can have a protective effect. Monument Therapeutics has reformulated a generic anti-inflammatory drug so that it can access the brain and potentially dampen down some of the brain inflammation that may be occurring post-surgery. It is preparing to launch a trial, initially in healthy volunteers, and if that proves successful, it will look to target POCD patients in the coming years. But scientists are also searching for ways of pinpointing the patients most at-risk of developing POCD so that they can be specifically targeted with some of these interventions. Studies in cardiac patients have found that people with low levels of antibodies against bacterial endotoxins are particularly at risk of POCD, suggesting that infection could also play a role in these symptoms. Monument Therapeutics has also identified a biomarker that it claims can predict POCD with 90% accuracy. “In future, we want to be able to measure people’s cognitive function before they go in for surgery, to get a measure of how vulnerable or resilient their brain is, and if they’re vulnerable, have a way to treat that,” says Barnett. Time will tell whether these approaches can help reduce the incidence of postoperative cognitive problems in the very young and the very old. But one thing is now clear, even when surgery is over, the risks are far from over. “We’ve got to stop thinking that when the anaesthetic wears off, everything’s fine,” says Warner. “Whether it’s the anaesthesia, the trauma of surgery, or the other effects of acute illness, people’s brains have a hard time around operations.”",News/Science,The hidden long-term risks of surgery: ‘It gives people’s brains a hard time’,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/24/the-hidden-long-term-risks-of-surgery-it-give-peoples-brains-a-hard-time
4/24/2022,"Candice Carty-Williams’s 2019 debut novel, Queenie, told the story of a 25-year-old British Jamaican woman as she navigates love, life, racism and herself. Its international success has been a phenomenon; it sold more than 160,000 copies in the UK alone and won British book of the year in 2020, making Carty-Williams the first black female author to win the award since its inception. Thanks to its success, her second novel has been highly awaited and backed up by an ambitious marketing campaign of showstopper events, major partnerships and innovative advertising. This kind of pressure must be immense for a new author. Still, on reading the premise of People Person – a family saga featuring five half-siblings with a solipsistic father forced to reconnect because of a catastrophe – my first thought was: this sounds great. The novel begins in the past with the smooth-talking, emotionally bankrupt Cyril Pennington and his infamous gold Jeep. He collects each of his children from their various homes and brings them together for an awkward and impromptu rendezvous. “Wha’ you know ’bout this tune?” Cyril shouts over blaring music, more interested in swaggering around town than facilitating an earnest reunion between these teenagers who barely know each other’s names. Here, we see glimpses of each sibling’s character. Dimple is sensitive, Nikisha is sharp-tongued, Lizzie is cold, Danny is airy and Prynce is boisterous. Tense moments abound, too: Nikisha fat-shames Dimple (something that affects her for years beyond). Lizzie’s mum, Kemi, refers to the other kids as Cyril’s litter. “Let her meet my mum and tell her about litter,” Nikisha shouts back. Fast forward to the present day – the story homes in on a now 3o-year-old Dimple, who provides the main vantage point of the narrative. She is an aspiring social media influencer who lives at home with her mother, a barrister and recovering alcoholic. She’s anxious, a little narcissistic and hungry for companionship. Things take a ghastly turn when Dimple’s ex-boyfriend Kyron turns up at her house and physically abuses her. During the attack, he accidentally slips on a puddle of cooking oil. Soon, the estranged siblings arrive to clumsily save the day. This is where a more farcical saga begins. Based upon what we know so far of these ambivalent relatives who are harbouring some unresolved resentment toward each other, it requires a lot of blind faith and gullibility to believe that these 25+-year-olds (with things to lose such as kids and jobs and partners) would, without much questioning or convincing, be prepared to hide a body in a “murder” that very much looks like an accident. The rest of the novel involves a lot of stressing and scheming as the siblings try to reckon with the aftermath of the incident and the fact that they’re now being blackmailed. We’re taken through family parties, fights between bitter mothers and funerals. All the while, the tension and friction bubbles up between the five siblings. There’s so much fretting and melodramatic buildup that when everything is miraculously wrapped up with a single, finger-wagging chat, you feel cheated. Where Carty-Williams reigns is in writing humorous speech. The way she uses quick-witted dialogue to highlight strained relationships makes it easy to imagine People Person on screen; a show such as Misfits comes to mind. Her portrait of Cyril’s jovial yet crumbling facade is written with such clarity it feels almost biographical. There’s a moment when all of the kids approach him, asking if he’s ready to finally be a father and he replies: “No… I don’t have it in me.” And that’s that. It’s one of the most soberingly relatable scenes I’ve ever read in a book. I wish Carty-Williams had realised the Penningtons needed few theatrics to reveal their dysfunction and focused on creating more organic moments such as this, rather than setting her characters up with all of these banana skins and trap doors that made them read like a Scooby-Doo ensemble. Still, although the plot devices sometimes feel too clunky or too convenient, People Person has much of the same coming-of-age themes that fans of Queenie will be familiar with, from navigating through bad relationships to finding yourself amid chaos.

4/24/2022,"Shameless criminals are exploiting the plight of desperate asylum seekers for their own ends. Yes, that’s right. Boris Johnson attempted to distract the public from his own transgressions with his hastily announced and arguably unworkable Rwanda Solution. Did you see what I did there? I’m here all week! Try the cake!! But keep it in the Tupperware box!!! Then it isn’t a cake. Schrödinger’s lockdown birthday. Was Boris Johnson’s Rwanda Solution even meant to be taken seriously? Was it no more real than his garden bridge, his Scotland-Northern Ireland tunnel, his bus-brokered £350m for the NHS, his marital commitments, his late-night promises to help his friend the former fraudster Darius Guppy maim a journalist, his 20-year fabrication of fake stories about Brussels bureaucrats and his personal integrity? Johnson’s Rwanda Solution is the political equivalent of a distraction theft, but while there may be a certain artistry to the well-crafted street con, Johnson’s Rwanda Solution was just an especially eggy stink bomb, let off in a court room, so he could run away before the jury condemned him. Hours later, Johnson boasts like Billy Bunter about his wizard wheeze behind the closed doors of the 1922 Committee: “I didn’t transport your refugees to Rwanda, Jenkins, and anyway, they smelled horrible.” But Johnson’s Rwanda Solution did give the Brexit government the opportunity to do what it does best, namely creating new and blameless enemies for the asset-stripped and non-specifically aggrieved British public to hate, Nineteen Eighty-Four-style, instead of them hating Johnson and his shameless cabal of outright liars and thieves as they ought to. In the halcyon days of the Brexit referendum, it was Brussels bureaucrats and Polish builders. Then it was high court judges, that girl with the EU flag costume and Terry Christian. Now it is the Conservatives’ client news-filter the BBC and any holy clerics who objected to the government’s 21st-century attempt at transportation. Rwanda-resistant religious leaders have actually been accused by the government of “virtue-signalling”, an activity that is literally the main point of religious leaders. You may as well criticise lifeboat crews for saving lives at sea, although the Brexit brigade do that as well. The archbishop of Canterbury told us that God himself would be against Johnson’s Rwanda Solution, which presumably makes Almighty Jah-Jah part of what the Daily Mail describes as the woke “army of leftwing lawyers and naysayers lining up to thwart Boris Johnson’s plan”. If God is on the Conservatives’ blacklist, that may explain why he has not been allowed to miraculously intervene in the Covid pandemic, all the contracts instead going to Tory party donors and a man Matt Handcock met in a pub. But by Wednesday, Johnson’s wall-spaffed Rwanda Solution was all but spent. It had served its purpose, buying the corrupt Tory party a day or so more of breathing space as the net of incontrovertible evidence of its leader’s undeniable moral bankruptcy tightened a little more. Another dead cat would need to be sacrificed on Carrie’s bloodstained kitchen table to get the government through to the weekend. Spurts of crimson gore spatter on Lulu Lytle’s mysteriously financed wallpaper and the house eunuch, Lord Geidt, sponges them off compliantly with a damp cloth, disposed of in a pedal bin full of non-birthday non-cake. It was strange trying to assemble this so-called “funny” “column” last week, as the political ground landslipped beneath us. I began it on Tuesday night in a Swindon hotel room overlooking an abandoned building project, after easily the worst gig of my tour. The night had been a disappointing throwback to my apprenticeship as a 90s club comedian, all my energies occupied by moment-to-moment crowd management, forcing me to take on a one-dimensional, high-status standup persona, stripped of nuance. Some stray rectangles of purple ticker tape that had been left in the theatre eaves by the selfish children’s entertainer Mr Tumble (MBE) kept falling down at key moments, sabotaging important lines, even though Tumble himself had already moved on to Hull City Hall. And the persistent and meaningless interjections of an indefatigable yet incoherent woman meant the second hour never reached the escape velocity required to sustain the closing 20 minutes of virtuoso free-jazz comedy soloing, so I had to abandon the show inconclusively. People’s time was wasted. I felt depressed and wondered if it was too late to get a different job. But on Wednesday night in Kingston, after another day’s drip-feed of Johnson’s duplicity, my closing Nuremberg-style litany of Johnson’s many crimes and misdemeanours suddenly seemed incontrovertible. What was once comic exaggeration coalesced into simple statements of fact. As of the middle of the week, it was undeniable to audiences that Johnson was a criminal and unfit for office, however passive-aggressively Jacob Rees-Mogg might state the opposite. The question was simply whether people were prepared to tolerate it any more. As I parroted my Covid-delayed 2020 routine once more, I realised I had to perform it until the end of August and worried my closing 10 might fall apart somewhat should justice be done and Johnson be deposed or even charged. I am probably the only champagne socialist hoping he clings to power, simply because I have a tight three of real zingers about all his various moral and ethical failings that gets me out of a 150-minute show on a high. I went back to the hotel to finish this column and realised I had lost my glasses somewhere in Kingston and the laptop screen was a blur. Luckily, I didn’t need them. The truth is written in letters a mile high. It’s up to the electorate if, when they go to the polls, they choose to ignore it because Brexit funny Boris immigration blah wank.

4/24/2022,"Unpaid carers face a real-terms cut of 4.5% in their weekly allowance, amid continued warnings about a major erosion in the value of state benefits. The decision not to make an emergency increase in benefits in response to ballooning inflation has this month seen some benefits fall by the largest amount in 50 years. It comes after chancellor Rishi Sunak resisted calls to increase welfare payments in his spring statement to help address the rising cost of living. New research suggests that people who receive the carer’s allowance, which is given to unpaid carers to help with their costs, are facing a cut of £170 a year in real terms this year. Like most benefits, carer’s allowance is increasing, by 3.1% – from £67.60 a week to £69.70, which works out at an extra 30p a day. However, taking into account price rises and inflation which is predicted to reach 8% this year, the carers in fact face a 4.5% real-terms cut. Research by the Liberal Democrats suggests that this amounts to £3.30 less a week, or a drop of £171.60 over the year. In total, the group will effectively lose £160m this year. There have already been concerns raised about the pressures facing the nation’s carers, including the ending of free Covid tests. Some have described the cut as a tax on caring. Research by Carers UK has found that 45% of unpaid carers are already finding it difficult to meet their monthly expenses, and 46% say increasing energy bills will negatively affect their health or the health of the person they care for. Many Tory MPs are frustrated that more action was not taken in the spring statement to make the welfare system more generous. Many now think action will have to be taken at the next budget in the autumn, but that significant damage could have been done to incomes and the party’s standing by then. A campaign to convince Sunak to retain the £20 increase in universal credit introduced at the start of the pandemic was rejected. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, called for the carer’s allowance to be increased to £89.70 a week, or an extra £1,040 a year. “Many family carers were already struggling to make ends meet. Now they are facing soaring energy bills and food prices,” he said. “It is a cost-of-caring crisis that is hitting the unsung heroes across our country looking after their loved ones each day. Carers need more help from the government, but instead Conservative ministers are slashing the meagre support currently on offer. It is breathtakingly awful.” A government spokesperson said the carer’s allowance paid £800 more a year than it did in 2010, that families can receive £2,000 a year through the carer’s element in Universal Credit, and that those receiving carer’s allowance may also be entitled to further support through the benefits system.",News/Society,Unpaid UK carers 4.5% worse off as cost of living erodes benefits value,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/24/unpaid-uk-carers-45-worse-off-as-cost-of-living-erodes-benefits-value
4/24/2022,"Sanluqueños may have occasional cares and worries, but you wouldn’t know it. The mood in the seaside town of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, north of Cádiz, seems to be one of euphoria, of alegría. It probably has something to do with the sun and translucent light, and a lot to do with the local manzanilla sherry. The town, also known for a prized king prawn, the langostino de Sanlúcar, has been named Gastronomy Capital of Spain 2022. This will come as no surprise to those who have long flocked to Sanlúcar for long, lazy weekend lunches. The town’s loveliness is also uplifting. At its heart is Plaza de Cabildo, with palms and a fountain encircled by restaurants with tables and umbrellas. Up a steep hill the Barrio Alto has churches (14th-century Nuestra Señora de la O is stark and mighty), old bars, small palaces with gardens, bodegas behind the white walls of former convents, and a sturdy castle – Castillo de Santiago. A short walk the other way are sandy beaches with moored dinghies, and the fish restaurants of Bajo de Guia, their tables along the beach of the Guadalquivir estuary offering views of fishing boats trailed by seagulls, and the bulbous ferry lumbering to the dunes and sandy wilds of the Unesco-listed Doñana reserve. The Portuguese Ferdinand Magellan and the woefully overlooked Basque Juan Sebastián Elcano set off from Sanlucar in 1519 on the first circumnavigation of the Earth. Only the latter survived to accomplish it, arriving back here with just 18 of the initial 270-man crew, 500 years ago this September. Manzanilla, the salty, fino-like sherry, is aged exclusively in Sanlucar’s cellars. Visitors can learn its history at the Manzanilla Interpretation Centre; sample it at bodegas, including Delgado Zuleta, the oldest (1744), and Barbadillo, the biggest; or breathe in its aroma at this relaxed, stylish restaurant ensconced within the Hidalgo La Gitana bodega. Specialising in classics such as meat and fish a la brasa (snapper is €19) and arroces, dry, creamy and soupy rice dishes (average €14) raised to sublime levels, it’s a place for lingering in. A glass of La Gitana manzanilla from the barrel costs €2.10; other wines are available.Fri-Sun 1-4pm, 8pm-12midnight. Mon, Wed & Thu lunch only, entrebotasrestaurante.es Waiters trot stacks of lacy tortillitas de camarones, crispy as brandy snaps, through crowded outdoor tables. The tortillitas are hard to resist, despite all the little eyes. Those who know their almejas (clams) from their coquinas (cockles) can select from the raw materials in the glass-fronted counter and eat inside, standing at a barrel. The bar, founded in 1939, has lugubrious charm, its history told in the photographs of starlets, matadors, guitarists and sherry barons adorning the walls. A lengthy menu featuring the best classic fish and seafood tapas around (from €2.50) is served on the terrace. As the jamones dangling above the bar suggest, there are meat options too.

Dogfish, cuttlefish, anchovies, bream, flounder and Sanlúcar’s famous wedge sole (acedia) come fried (from €15); snapper, seabass, red mullet and a dozen other varieties are served grilled or baked in salt (around €45 a kg). House specials include tuna in sweet Pedro Ximenéz sherry (€18), cazuela de huevos a la marinera – a stew of eggs and langostinos (€15) – and sea bass roe in olive oil (€40 a kg).

The prawn and tuna tacos (€5.90) are triumphs, so it seems their mission is accomplished. This is a good spot for tasting interesting twists – a salmorejo (cold soup) made of beetroot, cannelloni of pork cheeks, or octopus empanadilla, but also for sampling the unadulterated natural flavours of local tuna in the form of tartare (€14.50), tataki (€14.50) and jamón (€12.50). The setting at the base of a residential block is not showy, and balcony seating is limited, but it does face the Playa de la Calzada.

More traditional Cadiz tapas are also available, from mojama (air-dried tuna) to local cheese, pork loin, black pudding and chorizo de orza (preserved in ceramic pots with spices and lard).

Hotel Barrameda (doubles from €49.50 room-only) is calming, air-conditioned and comfortable with trees in tubs, and good service.

4/24/2022,"It has been described as Guantánamo-on-Ouse: a giant one-stop reception centre for asylum seekers due to open within weeks slap bang in the middle of a quiet, bucolic North Yorkshire village. “When we first heard about it they said 500 people and we thought that’s just about manageable,” said 67-year-old Taff Morgan. “Then last night we heard 1,500 and that might not be the maximum. It depends on how many they can fit in.” Morgan lives in Linton-on-Ouse and like most people in the village he is still digesting the enormity of the government’s New Plan for Immigration. Most of the attention and controversy has been directed at the proposal to send people to Rwanda. Refugees not sent there will, the government said, go to a new reception centre at the former RAF base at Linton-on-Ouse where they will live while their claims are processed. The base is not close to Linton, it’s part of Linton. “People keep saying there are 1,200 people living in the village,” said Morgan, a former squadron leader and pilot trainer at the base. “That was when the quarters were fully occupied and it was a fully running military base. Now there’s only about 500 of us. They want to quadruple the population. It just won’t work.” RAF Linton closed in 2020 and has a history locals are proud of. “The Home Office has done more damage to this village in a week than the Germans did in six years of the war,” said Morgan. Parish council meetings held in the village hall normally attract a handful of members of the public. On Thursday, there was standing room only as more than 120 residents crammed in to listen to a Home Office official give more details of the plan. It would, residents were told, be predominantly adult single men single from Syria, Iran, Iraq and Eritrea being sent to Linton. They might have to live in Greek-style temporary containers. They could live there for up to six months. They will be free to come and go but will be expected back at the site by 10pm. Villagers point out they don’t have the infrastructure to cope. There are four buses a day to York, 10 miles away. There’s one shop. The village pub closed a number of years ago. “When we had the floods it meant a 52-mile round trip to Tesco’s in York to get some shopping,” said Morgan. Refugee charities have called the planned centre a cross between a hostel and low-security prison. Darryl Smalley, a Lib Dem councillor on York council described it as a “Guantánamo-on-Ouse plan” and “an ill-thought-out, cruel and morally bankrupt ploy to reduce our obligations to the most desperate people”. Villagers insist they are not being racist or nimby in objecting to the proposal. The new centre, they say, should not be in anyone’s backyard. People at the meeting expressed fears that they would become “prisoners in their own home” because of the centre. “They say they’re going to give us CCTV,” said Morgan. “But we’ve never needed it. They say they’re going to give us extra police … but we’ve never needed it.” The plan for the centre was announced, out of the blue, last week. The Home Office says the radical plan is needed because about 37,000 destitute migrants are being accommodated in hotels costing the taxpayer, it says, £4.7m a day. Kevin Hollinrake, the local Conservative MP for Thirsk and Malton, initially suggested he was in favour of the plan. But he is now firmly against, pointing to the Home Office’s own guidance that says asylum seekers should be accommodated in urban areas with easy access to support and services. The Home Office wants to open the centre within weeks but Hollinrake believes planning permission is needed. He said he would also support a judicial review of the plan. Yvonne Cavanagh owns the village shop. She could not get in Thursday’s meeting so is waiting to hear further details of the plan at a meeting organised by Hollinrake for Saturday. “I’ve not got an opinion yet,” she said. “They’ve pee-ed off a lot of people. The majority of the village are against it but I think we need to hear the facts first.”",News/UK news,"‘Guantánamo-on-Ouse’ plans to place 1,500 asylum seekers in Yorkshire village",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/24/guantanamo-on-ouse-plans-to-place-1500-asylum-seekers-in-yorkshire-village
4/24/2022,"Previously unseen etchings that Lucian Freud rejected or reworked are to be published for the first time as part of a definitive study that will document every print he ever created. The etchings offer fresh insights into one of the most revered artists of the 20th century, revealing his thinking process and attention to detail. A charming Christmas card of three boats Freud is thought to have made as a schoolboy and a striking study of a woman’s head that he decided not to publish are among pieces that will appear in the study. Other works in Lucian Freud: Catalogue Raisonné of the Prints, published by Modern Art Press on 24 May, show how Freud, who died in 2011, reworked compositions, erasing and revising areas that he did not like. Its author, Toby Treves, the Tate’s former collections curator of 20th-century British art, said: “There are a couple of really lovely ones where you wonder why he didn’t publish them because they’re great.” He singled out, for example, a “really beautiful” study of a head, which may have been inspired by Susanna Chancellor, one of Freud’s former lovers: “It is especially lovely.” A previously unpublished first state of Freud’s etching of his whippet, Pluto, reveals that it originally featured Chancellor’s entire body. He was dissatisfied with the composition and had the plate cut down, leaving only Pluto sleeping against part of her body. Unpublished states and trial proofs that preceded the published edition of Reclining Figure, a depiction of the performance artist Leigh Bowery, reveal that Freud had struggled with the foreshortening of the head, erasing and redrawing it and part of the shoulder twice until he reached the final state. Many of these images were among more than 140 trial proofs amassed by the printmaker Marc Balakjian, who died in 2017, having worked closely with Freud for many years. In 2019, in lieu of estate duty, the collection went to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, which plans to exhibit some of them next year. Treves is also co-author, with Catherine Lampert, of Lucian Freud: Catalogue Raisonné of the Paintings, which will be published next year. He paid tribute to Balakjian’s exceptional knowledge of inks and his sensitive eye for tonal variations: “He was a brilliant master printmaker and Lucian learned a lot from him. Much of what Lucian was able to do with prints later on was because Marc opened up so many more possibilities to him through his technical brilliance. Marc would print off maybe eight or 10 prints, each with a different inking. Then Freud would make his choice, leaving nine, let’s say, that were not to be published … Marc held on to them for reference and, when he died, there they all were.” The catalogue raisonné will include an essay that Balakjian had been commissioned to write about his collaboration. He described the challenges, including working on Freud’s self-portrait prints: “The first one was a small plate, which he did not like. He scratched scribbling lines on the face to cancel the plate before it was etched.” Treves said: “One of the really remarkable things is how much care Lucian took over them. With some, he just put in a handful of lines on a plate that may have tens of thousands of lines on it. And yet his eye is so acute that he’s seeing a little weakness there. And he’s right. You see the different states and you can see why he did it.”",Arts/Art and design,Previously unseen Lucian Freud etchings to be published for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/24/lucian-freud-etchings-to-be-published-for-first-time
4/24/2022,"There’s a bend in the Thames that gives special prominence to the buildings along it. Here, between Waterloo and Blackfriars Bridges, the south bank of the river bulges outwards, such that anything that stands there takes its place among the north bank’s array of monuments – the Houses of Parliament, Somerset House, St Paul’s Cathedral. If the elaborate British planning system has any ability to influence the quality of architecture in sensitive locations, it should be evident in a place like this. If not, then places of equal importance all over the country are in danger. 72 Upper Ground is a proposal, designed by Make Architects for the developers Mitsubishi Estate and CO-RE, for putting about 1m sq ft mostly of offices along this part of the river. It would stand just along from the National Theatre and the Southbank arts centre, achievements of postwar public investment in culture whose success increases the desirability and hence property values of the area. It would replace a tower and studio block formerly used by ITV. The proposed building is, not to put too fine a point on it, a brute. It would increase the floor area of the current accommodation on the site by 230%. It would be 109m high compared with the 72m of the existing tower. Its height, though, is not the primary issue: it is also broad, made of aggressively stacked-up blocks, horizontally banded, with a big pile at the back of the site and second, lower one to the front. It is out of scale with its surroundings and disconnected from them. There is no particular magic or logic to the architecture. It takes its blockiness and striations from Denys Lasdun’s design for the National Theatre, only at an inflated scale and with less sense of purpose, such that it looks parodic rather than respectful. Its designers seem to have taken some inspiration from The Interlace, a well-known development of similarly stacked-up forms in Singapore. There, though, the design aims to maximise open space and gardens. Here, it’s about squeezing as much profitable volume as possible out of the site. The building would block out light from neighbouring homes and public spaces. In return, it offers limited public benefits. As this is an office development, rather than residential, there is no requirement to provide affordable housing as part of the planning deal. Instead, the developers promise what they grandly call “two new public squares”, in reality modest additions to the extensive open space already in the area. The most enticing element of the design, an elevated roof garden several storeys off the ground, will not be accessible to the general public. The backers’ best argument is that the project will create an estimated 4,000 jobs, but many of these are likely to go to commuters into nearby Waterloo Station rather than to residents of the borough of Lambeth, in which it would stand. As 3.5m sq ft of office space is in the pipeline in the area, it’s questionable whether even more, especially with post-Covid changing work patterns, is what it most needs. The proposals include some affordable work spaces, just above the minimum required by Lambeth planning policy, with the promise that they will be available to local creatives, but there is scant detail on how this will be achieved. Florence Eshalomi, the local MP, has warned of a “significant number of negative consequences” and expressed the hope that the proposal “will be reconsidered in favour of one which utilises this key strategic site for local benefit without such a substantial degree of unnecessary harm”. Local objectors have called it “grotesquery on steroids, a swollen deformity for the south bank”. Lambeth’s planning department acknowledges that the development is “controversial and extremely unpopular”. Yet planning officers recommended approval of the application for 72 Upper Ground and the planning committee recently voted six to one in favour. They did so with only sketchy scrutiny of the design. One councillor who supported the project called it a “Marmite” scheme, which implies that the quality of its architecture is purely a matter of subjective taste. This view ignores the fact that Lambeth has several policies that seek to define what is and is not good design. In principle, there is nothing wrong with a substantial employment-generating development on this site, but planners have to decide the point at which big becomes too big. There has to be a meaningful examination of the quality of the design, one in which the onus is on the applicants to explain what is good about it. Planning policies have long proclaimed the principle that tall buildings should be “well-designed”, but approval of 72 Upper Ground renders them almost valueless. The story is not over yet. Both London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the communities secretary, Michael Gove, have the power to overturn Lambeth’s decision or, in Gove’s case, to make it the subject of a public inquiry. Gove has declared his belief in promoting “beautiful” structures and limiting “ugly” ones, which echoes a number of government pronouncements about “building beautiful”. If he is serious, he should support an inquiry into 72 Upper Ground, to establish what such statements mean. The location of the proposal is prized. One end of Boris Johnson’s ill-fated garden bridge was, for this reason, going to land nearby. It is a gift of nature – the bend on the river – and public investment in infrastructure (bridges, the river embankment, transport) and in culture. The developers of 72 Upper Ground want to mine those assets for private profit. The planning system should demand that they give more back to the public in return. That is what it is for.

4/24/2022,"Since birth requires an overnight stay, and our daughter arrived at 9.20am, we had a minimum of 36 hours in hospital, getting to know her and giving staff the chance to do all the tests they do to make sure your child is a fully operational baby. We also spent five days in the hospital with my son, there are several workplaces we’ve spent less time in than Homerton hospital. We were there so long that time we ended up signing retirement cards for some of the nurses, and were probably only a few hours away from having Amazon packages delivered to the ward. It’s weird being in somebody’s workplace in any context, let alone dressing, undressing, and brushing your teeth there. Sleepless nights spent pacing and cuddling already have a surreal tinge, and more so when only a thin curtain separates you from the daily labours of an entire workforce, with all the soft footsteps and beeping and shift changes those entail. You’re also in a strange state of communion with a dozen other couples and their newborns, each believing your own curtain to be a magic noise-cancelling device, and each oblivious to the fact your every bicker and fart is audible to the whole group. This nearness was mostly pleasant; an odd auditory community bound by tiredness, parental love, and an urgent, passionate need to keep their curtains closed at all times so that no one could see the absolute mess we’d made of our cubicles. And sometimes it felt too intimate by half, as we heard the soft, quiet potentiality of bad news two curtains down – muffled petitions in sing-song sadness, delivered by people more tired than any of us, uttering dreadful words like, ‘Should we be worried?’ Mostly, it was a masterclass in watching healthcare workers at their godlike best. Nurses and midwives walking around with babies on their shoulders, like stockbrokers nonchalantly cradling phones in the crook of their necks in 80s movies. It’s calming to spend eight minutes attempting the perfect, safe-arm posture necessary to pick up your cooing infant, only to see a midwife pick one up, single-handed, as if it’s an avocado she’s checking for ripeness. I’m not even that calm at my job, which this week is sitting on my arse and describing their job. The rest of our stay is a blur. Little sleep, many cuddles, the rediscovery of all the miraculous fluids that flow in and out of a newborn child. Bad sandwiches, worse magazines, the deep, para-social exhilaration of hearing the couple two curtains down getting better news. Our daughter’s tests were exhausted by the following lunchtime, and she was judged safe to leave after her hearing test was conducted. This was done by fitting her with an earphone and playing a sequence of noises down her auditory canal, which had the added, pleasing effect of looking like the attending nurse was playing her a mixtape she just had to hear before she left. And then we were ejected, blinking, into the world, and in 20 minutes she was in her big brother’s delighted arms. ‘MY LITTLE SISTER,’ he cried, repeatedly, having clearly been well drilled by his grandparents in our absence. Soon there was shouting and laughing and crying in place of the beeping hush we’d become used to. We sat and blinked as exhaustion took hold. Where’s a decent magic curtain when you need one?

4/24/2022,"In May 1926, Anna Essinger opened a progressive co-educational boarding school at Ulm in Germany. When Hitler came to power in 1933, she realised that the new regime was opposed to everything she stood for and, writes Deborah Cadbury, “resolved to move her entire establishment, lock, stock and barrel, out of Germany, right under the noses of the Nazi authorities”. So Essinger set off with “an advance party of six teachers and six senior boys and girls to make preparations in England for the arrival of the others. Sixty-five children would follow two weeks later.” To ensure secrecy, each of the three separate groups “masquerad[ed] as day trippers on a picnic with a member of staff”. Thus was born Bunce Court school. It was inevitably a very “Germanic” institution – most of the teachers and pupils were German and, despite constant exhortations to “Speak English!”, some had strong accents – yet it operated in the Kent countryside and then in Shropshire throughout the second world war. Many of the staff, keen to escape Nazi Germany, were distinctly overqualified: the boiler man had been a director at the Deutsches Theater, while the maths teacher was a distinguished astronomer. And there was also a notable stress on traditional Germanic high culture. (The music teacher almost had a fit when pupils suggested a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan.) The initial intake was supplemented by some English pupils but also by children who arrived on the Kindertransport and then by an even more traumatised group who had survived concentration camps or a life in hiding in Nazi-controlled central Europe. One boy described by Cadbury, for example, “refused vegetables because they reminded him of the grass that he had had to eat to survive”. Keeping the school going was a constant challenge, as Essinger coped with outbreaks of polio, erratic electricity, inadequate heating, an official order to leave the original Kent location at three days’ notice and snowstorms that cut off the delivery of food. She had always believed that education should be about developing practical as well as academic skills, but in England a permanent lack of funds made it essential for pupils to muck in with chores such as gardening, carpentry and feeding the chickens. Local communities were not always sympathetic to the Germans in their midst, school inspectors applied the rules with unimaginative rigour and in 1940 all foreign-born staff and pupils over the age of 16 were interned as “enemy aliens”. Yet when the school closed its gates in 1948, it could point to remarkable achievements. It had helped children who had been through almost unimaginable horror build new lives for themselves. The 900 alumni included the painter Frank Auerbach; the cartoonist and provocateur Gerard Hoffnung; the immunologist Leslie Brent, whose work with Peter Medawar won the latter a Nobel prize; and Richard Sonnenfeldt, the chief interpreter for the American prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials. So what was the secret of its success? My mother attended Bunce Court and I once made a radio documentary about the last-ever school reunion, so I have myself interviewed many of the same people and heard some, though by no means all, of the stories cited here. Cadbury has constructed a lively and compelling narrative, although Essinger, deeply compassionate but strait-laced and outwardly rather severe, never quite comes to life as an individual. Many of the attempts to describe the “Bunce Court spirit” are also a bit vague and idealising but perhaps the most striking is the suggestion of one former pupil that the school was animated by “a complex amalgam of humanism, the Quaker faith, liberal values and Judaism, brought together by the mind of a woman whose one purpose in life seemed to be to serve children”. Another, who came from an English school where she had just learned about the Tudors and Stuarts, was amazed by a style of teaching that was “more like a conversation” and required her to write essays on urgently topical issues such as “American isolation and imperialism”. Cadbury also explores some of the techniques adopted at Bunce Court to try and get through to the more traumatised pupils. On one memorable occasion, gym teacher Hans Meyer was confronted by a boy who, we read, “responded to his inner turmoil by flying into frenzied rages”. When Meyer tried to restrain him “with a firm but loving embrace”, he spat in his face. So the teacher told him: “Go ahead and spit. Let everything out.” The boy just continued spitting, before breaking down into “uncontrollable tears”. Much of this book is fascinating and moving, yet there is something unsatisfactory about its structure. The second half alternates chapters largely about the school itself with accounts of how some of the pupils were persecuted by the Nazis before they reached Bunce Court. This material is often horrifying, but it inevitably packs an emotional punch whichthat rather overshadows Essinger’s otherwise heroic achievements.

4/24/2022,"Better Call Saul (Netflix) | netflix.comRussian Doll (Netflix) | netflix.comThe Thief, His Wife and the Canoe (ITV) | itv.comChivalry (Channel 4) | channel4.com What makes some TV characters so effortlessly cool? Take Saul Goodman, AKA Jimmy McGill, the grifting lawyer, returning to Netflix in the sixth and final series of Better Call Saul. Truth is, Goodman – garish suits, used-car salesman patter, the kind of clumpy comb-over last seen on Human League fans in 1981 – shouldn’t be cool. Goodman, magnificently played by Bob Odenkirk, is where cool capsizes into desperate, and perhaps that’s his secret: he is all of us at our best, our worst, our most vulnerably human. Delayed by the pandemic, and also Odenkirk’s on-set heart attack, the Breaking Bad prequel, led by showrunners Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, returns with a snap, as if it had merely broken for lunch. It eschews the usual black-and-white preamble showing Goodman’s listless BB-afterlife: hiding incognito, running a branch of Cinnabon. Instead, there’s a swirling ballet of his signature loud ties, followed by a forward-flash to the dismantling of his BB-era mansion, a bricks-and-mortar midlife crisis of tragic gold toilet, Viagra and a life-size cardboard cutout Saul that ends up tossed into a dumpster. The opening two episodes return to where series five left off: Goodman’s dogged (realistically tedious?) legal vendettas, aided by lawyer-wife Kim (Rhea Seehorn), shapeshifting into an underworld Grace Kelly, and a parallel Mexican drug cartel storyline, showing the aftermath of the failed assassination of Lalo Salamanca, played by Tony Dalton with sizzling sociopathic brio. News of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman (Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul) appearing in future episodes almost melted the internet, and certainly it’s thrilling when Breaking Bad-era characters appear: “chicken man” Gus (Giancarlo Esposito); glowering Hector (Mark Margolis); cartel-fixer Mike (Jonathan Banks), who takes his murderous orders with the impassive gaze of a depressed gargoyle, yet still conveys core decency. Prequels are strange, cramped beasts, robbed of crucial elements of surprise. We know that key characters survive; yet, just as crucially, we don’t know everything. What will happen to Saul and Kim’s brittle relationship? And to Kim? When do we first clap eyes on America’s most demented chemistry teacher? Better Call Saul is a small-screen masterpiece; in some ways – meticulous plotting; 3D characterisation; slow-release humour – superior to its predecessor. Savour every moment as it shuffles towards the endgame. Also returning on Netflix, for a seven-part second series, is Russian Doll. Starring Natasha Lyonne, who writes and directs some episodes and is a co-creator along with Leslye Headland and Amy Poehler, the first series served as a millennial Groundhog Day, a trippy, quasi-sci-fi mini-epic, with Lyonne’s character Nadia trying to get through her 36th birthday party, but repeatedly being “killed” and flung back to do it again. Adventurous, witty, disquieting, time-bending, Russian Doll was elevated by Lyonne’s bravura, wise-cracking performance. In season two, Lyonne carries on the good work, rasping out one-liners with hyper-Al Pacino New York delivery: “I am acutely aware that my lungs are essentially two shrivelled Nick Caves.” The inventive soundtrack – from Depeche Mode to Bauhaus to Janis Joplin – further signals that the production is deeply cared about. That’s the good news. Unfortunately, Russian Doll 2 is otherwise a bit of a tangled, overwrought mess. While trying to avoid a minefield of spoilers, I can report that, along with multiple time zones (1944, 1962, 1982), there is a Holocaust theme, an existential deep-dive into Nadia’s family history, as well as meditations on mental illness, drugs, death, and more. Lots more. Whisper it: too much. Nadia’s fellow time-looper Alan (Charlie Barnett) feels underemployed, and even appearances from Chloë Sevigny (Kids) and Annie Murphy (Schitt’s Creek) fail to mesh the overly scattered themes. While still watchable (ish), I’m not convinced this second series was necessary. ITV’s four-part true crime drama The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe, written by Chris Lang (The Unforgotten), focuses on the Hartlepool couple John and Anne Darwin, who collected the insurance money after he faked his death from drowning in a canoe. Eddie Marsan plays the dominant, absurd John Darwin – “What I am is a man who thinks outside the box” – while Monica Dolan is the overwhelmed, mousy Anne. We are invited to view Anne as the victim of her fantasist husband. Their relationship resembles a cult: John as the charismatic leader, Anne gulping down the marital Kool-Aid. Dolan and Marsan are both superb; she is near-hysterical with stress about lying to the police and to their sons, while he is variously abusive, delusional, comic, even sexually rapacious. At one point he intones: “It’s been a long three weeks, love … for both of us” with such a pointed look, it made me laugh out loud. The obvious comparison is 2021’s Landscapers, another true crime drama about a supposed “ordinary couple”. While far from mystical, The Thief … is nicely crafted in its depiction of dysfunction in a marriage in a dank, unpretty England of grey seas, fry-ups and peeling wallpaper. Anyone in the market for a post-#MeToo comedy? Actually, Channel 4’s Chivalry, co-starring and co-written by Sarah Solemani and Steve Coogan, is subtle and twisty. Set in Hollywood, it’s an examination of sexism and cancel culture in which neither side gets away entirely scot-free. Solemani plays a feminist indie director hired to save a film from a boorish anti-censorship auteur (“Why don’t you get a hammer and take it to the Venus de Milo? She’s got her fucking tits out”). As the producer, Coogan claims to understand the new culture but then moans: “You can’t even describe people with adjectives any more.” There’s a robust supporting cast – Wanda Sykes as a cynical producer; Aisling Bea as a clueless intimacy co-ordinator – and cameos from Paul Rudd and John C Reilly. Two episodes in (all six available on All 4), I like it. Think Episodes, but with added newsy, generational acid splashes. Inside No 9(BBC Two)This is the seventh outing for the blackly comedic anthology series from Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. The opener involves a reunion trip on a pedalo, and co-stars League of Gentlemen collaborator Mark Gatiss and the reliably sparky Diane Morgan.
