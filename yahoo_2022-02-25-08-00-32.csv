2/25/2022,"An international relations expert is warning that the attacks on Ukraine by Russian forces will lead to dire consequences unless the leaders of other nations change how they deal with Russia - and that includes Canada. Russia is in the midst of invading Ukraine from land, sea and air, zeroing in on cities and military targets. Aurel Braun is a professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto, as well as an associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies Harvard University. He says so far, leaders in countries like the U.S. have used tactics that are too soft, which is why Russia is escalating its presence in the Ukraine. Unless we change our collective approach to Russia, we’re not going to be able to stop this. It’s likely to get worse. Not because Putin is some mad aggressor who wants to conquer countries all over the world, but because he’s an opportunist who will take whatever he can if he finds weakness.
Aurel Braun, Professor of International Relations and Political Science, University of Toronto It appears sanctions against Russia haven’t been enough. Braun says the lack of defence armament from other countries makes Ukraine a soft target. Meanwhile, diplomacy talks with the US have only appeared to make Putin more emboldened. Ukrainians are fleeing the capital, Kyiv, as President Volodymyr Zelensky declares martial law in response to Russia's attack on multiple targets in the country. Domestically, Canada is close to Ukraine because of the large diaspora that live here. When it comes to our role in the current situation, Canada has sent $7.8 million for lethal military equipment, which Braun says would add up to roughly three hours of ammunition. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued a first round of sanctions against Russia and more troops have been sent to Europe. About 400 Canadian troops have been stationed in Latvia for the last several years, which Braun says puts Canada closer to the frontlines. If Mr. Putin decides to attack Latvia, Canadians soldiers will die, it’s that basic,” he says. “This is very real for Canada. We’re not bystanders.
Aurel Braun, Professor of International Relations and Political Science, University of Toronto Another thing to consider is Canada’s geographical position across the Atlantic Ocean from Russia. The Arctic has become an important and contested area, thanks to its vast natural resources – 20 to 30 per cent of the world’s hydrocarbons are there. It's also an incredibly fragile ecological area, so that if an accident were to occur there, it would be catastrophic. Though Canada has banned any exploration in most areas of the Arctic, Russia has moved full steam ahead with exploration, since 60 per cent of their exports are hydrocarbons. “They’re not restrained by the Glasgow or Paris Agreements,” says Braun. “They’ve paid lip service to it, but in reality they’ve disregarded it...any accident would have horrific effects to the Canadian Arctic coastline.” Russia has militarized the Arctic since it’s becoming more of a strategic area for them, which directly affects Canada. “If we don’t deter Russia, Canada’s is going to be affected directly,” Braun says. “Materially, ecologically, and strategically.”",News/Yahoo News Canada,"'If we don’t deter Russia, Canada is going to be affected directly': Attacks on Ukraine could threaten security of Canada",https://news.yahoo.com/canada-russia-ukraine-war-impact-arctic-security-172703258.html

2/25/2022,"PRAGUE (AP) — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shocked the former Soviet satellite states of Central and Eastern Europe, drawing strong condemnation even from the region’s most pro-Kremlin politicians. For some of the countries that fled the Soviet bloc following a series of anti-communist revolutions more than 30 years ago, footage of tanks and troops rolling in to punish a nation trying to pursue its own independent course looks painfully familiar. Two until now major pro-Russian voices in the European Union, Czech President Milos Zeman and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, didn't mince their words in criticizing Moscow’s most aggressive action since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Their countries experienced comparable brutality — the Czech Republic, as part of Czechoslovakia, in 1968 and Hungary in 1956. Zeman called Thursday's invasion “an unprovoked act of aggression.” “Russia has committed a crime against peace,” he said in an address to the nation. Zeman had previously made news by calling Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula “a fait accompli.” Many in the Czech Republic reviled Zeman as a “servant of Kremlin” after he sided with Russia and cast doubt on the findings of his own security and intelligence services on the alleged participation of Russian spies in a huge 2014 ammunition explosion. Until just days ago, Zeman was insisting that the Russians wouldn't attack Ukraine because “they aren’t lunatics to launch an operation that would be more damaging for them than beneficial.” “I admit I was wrong,” he said Thursday. Zeman has called for harsh sanctions against Russia, including cutting it out of the SWIFT financial system which shuffles money from bank to bank around the globe. “It’s necessary to isolate a lunatic and not just to defend ourselves by words but also by deeds,” he said. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also voiced full support for the strongest possible sanctions for what he called “an absolutely unjustified act of aggression against a sovereign state.” Prague ordered the closure of two Russian consulates in the Czech Republic and stopped accepting visa requests from Russian citizens. Pavel Rychetsky, the chief judge at the Constitutional court, the country’s highest legal authority, suggested that a European arrest warrant should be issued against Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said Putin should be tried at the International Criminal Court for “an unprecedented unleashing of war on the European continent for the first time since World War II.” In Hungary, high ranking officials had for weeks avoided condemning Russia’s actions directly. Under Orban, the country has pursued close ties with Putin, a point of concern for many of Hungary’s western partners. Hungary has historically deeply distrusted Moscow, which ordered the brutal repression of an anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. But Orban in recent years has pursued a diplomatic and economic strategy he calls “Eastern Opening,” which favors closer ties with countries to the east, and in his frequent battles with the EU has called the 27-nation bloc an oppressive imperial power similar to Hungary’s former Soviet occupiers. But on Thursday, Orban was clear in his condemnation of the Kremlin. “Russia attacked Ukraine this morning with military force,” Orban said in a video on Facebook. “Together with our European Union and NATO allies, we condemn Russia’s military action.” “Hungary’s position is clear: we stand by Ukraine, we stand by Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” his Foreign Minister Peter Szijijarto said. Bulgaria, Moscow’s closest ally during the Cold War, followed suit. “Having strategic bombers and missiles flying in Europe in the 21st century, assaults by air and sea against a sovereign state, is absolutely inadmissible,” President Rumen Radev said. Romania also stood staunchly with its western partners. “Through today’s cynical invasion, the Russian Federation is the architect of the worst security crisis since World War II,” the ruling coalition leaders said. Neighboring Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of the few former communist Eastern European countries not to have joined NATO so far, echoed these views. Moldovan President Maia Sandu stressed that Russia’s attacks were launched “in violation of international norms,” adding that the international community “unanimously condemns these military actions.” ___ Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, Veselin Toskov in Sofia, Bulgaria and Stephen McGrath in Bucharest, Romania, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"By invading Ukraine, Putin loses allies in eastern Europe",https://news.yahoo.com/invading-ukraine-putin-loses-allies-201605774.html
2/25/2022,"When it comes to protecting the rights of trans youth in Texas, stars are getting on their digital soapboxes. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a directive Tuesday ordering the state child welfare agency to investigate reports of “gender-transitioning procedures” as child abuse. The move comes one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a written opinion defining gender-affirming care as child abuse under state laws – and months after state lawmakers considered but did not pass similar bills when the Legislature met last year. Transgender advocates accused Abbott and Paxton of twisting state law to meet their political goals and biases, particularly after efforts to define gender-affirming medical care as child abuse died last year in the Texas House after passage in the Senate.

On Wednesday morning, one York County camera was also good for catching a pair of men who appear to be stealing a road sign. A state Department of Transportation employee was doing a routine camera check and saw two men taking a sign on Interstate 83 in the area of the southbound Shrewsbury exit ramp, according to safety press officer Fritzi Schreffler. The camera showed two men clearly taking one of two signs from that spot and placing it in the back of a silver pickup.

Schreffler said the PennDOT employee reported the incident to Pennsylvania State Police, who picked up the men. She said it’s highly unusual to capture something like this. “Usually we get stuff after the fact,” Schreffler said. “We get calls all of the time requesting video of crashes or whatever, but typically our cameras are facing the other way.” Each shift performs a run through all of the cameras to make sure they are working.

2/25/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Convicted killer Scott Peterson's chance for a new trial in the murders of his pregnant wife and unborn son 20 years ago hinges on whether a California juror who helped send him to prison in 2004 amid worldwide publicity was biased because she was a domestic violence victim. Though she is identified in court documents only as Juror 7, Richelle Nice used her name when she co-authored a book about the case with six other jurors. During the trial, her dyed red hair made her recognizable and earned her the nickname “Strawberry Shortcake.” She is expected to testify Friday under a grant of immunity from prosecution. Her appearance will come at the start of a weeklong hearing centered on whether she lied about her history with domestic violence to get on a jury so she could vote to convict Peterson. “This hearing is critical,"" said Pat Harris, one of Peterson's attorneys. “This is his chance to show that she did commit misconduct and to have the whole thing thrown out.” Nice failed to disclose during jury selection that she sought a restraining order while pregnant in 2000, saying she “really fears for her unborn child” because of threats from her boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend. She also failed to disclose that her boyfriend beat her in 2001 while she was pregnant with another child. Laci Peterson, 27, was killed when she was eight months pregnant with a son, whom the Petersons planned to name Conner. Investigators said that on Christmas Eve 2002, Scott Peterson dumped his wife's body from his fishing boat into San Francisco Bay. Peterson was eventually arrested after Amber Frey, a massage therapist living in Fresno, told police they had begun dating a month before Laci Peterson's death. She said he had told her his wife was dead. Peterson has maintained his innocence throughout. Although the state Supreme Court threw out Peterson’s death sentence in December and ordered Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo to decide if Nice tainted his trial, it said “there was considerable other circumstantial evidence incriminating Peterson.” If Peterson gets a new trial, Harris said they can present new evidence that burglars were nearby on the day Laci Peterson disappeared, that witnesses saw her alive that day, and that her fetus was “alive for at least another five to six days” based on an examination of the fetal remains. However, prosecutors said Peterson’s attorneys have presented no evidence to support their assertions that he deserves a new trial because Nice had a “darker motive” to be on the jury “and was in essence a stealth juror.” Depending on Nice’s testimony Friday, Peterson’s attorneys plan to put on witnesses including fellow jurors and co-authors of their book, “We, the Jury.” They also want People magazine reporter Johnny Dodd to testify about the “extraordinary” 17 letters Nice wrote to Peterson after his conviction and the eight letters Peterson wrote to Nice. Two filmmakers who worked on the post-trial television documentary “The Murder of Laci Peterson” are to testify that they noticed on Nice’s wall a photograph of a child wearing pajamas that said “Little-man.” Justin Falconer, a fellow juror before he was discharged, could testify that Nice talked a lot about Conner, referring to him as “little man.” Peterson’s attorneys say he would also testify that Nice said she was having financial problems and that they joked about post-trial book and movie deals. To have his conviction thrown out, Peterson’s attorneys must show Massullo that Nice committed misconduct and did so “based on a bias toward convicting Scott,” Harris said. Nice answered “no” on a juror questionnaire when she was asked if she had ever been a crime victim or involved in a lawsuit. She said in a sworn declaration last year that she didn't “feel ‘victimized’ the way the law might define that term,” and didn’t think the restraining order was a lawsuit. Her new attorney has told both prosecutors and defense attorneys that she will cite her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination until she is granted immunity from any prosecution for perjury. The attorney, Geoffrey Carr, said he insisted on immunity to protect his client from things that are stated with certainty in last year's sworn statement but where she might hedge on the witness stand. “Most of the substance of it is correct, but not all, and some of it is a matter of how you interpret stuff,” he told The Associated Press. Sometimes “the language is more assertive” in the sworn declaration than it was in reality. “I’m not anticipating bombshells” or “any surprises about what she's going to say,” Carr said. He said he's telling Nice that “her only obligation at this point is to tell the stone bloody truth.” Stanislaus County prosecutors are sparring with Peterson's attorneys over the significance of Nice's refusal to testify without immunity. “A juror’s refusal to cooperate in an investigation of her own misconduct may well evidence her bias,” Peterson's attorneys said in a court filing, adding that ""a witness has lied under oath is certainly relevant to credibility.” But prosecutors said that “should Juror No. 7 exercise her privilege against self-incrimination ... no inference be drawn as to the witness’s credibility.”",U.S./Associated Press,Scott Peterson's new trial rests on 'Strawberry Shortcake',https://news.yahoo.com/scott-petersons-trial-rests-strawberry-181437311.html

Videos from Monday and Thursday appeared to show the Russian president wearing the same clothes. The videos showed Putin wearing a black blazer with a white dress shirt and a maroon tie. Russian President Vladimir Putin's attire during his Thursday war declaration suggests his speech may have been pretaped. In a video that aired early Thursday in Russia, Putin said he would launch a ""special military action"" against Ukraine. During a televised address on Monday, Putin appeared to wear the same outfit as he denounced Ukraine's sovereignty, argued that Ukraine was a creation of the Soviet Union, and announced military intervention in eastern Ukraine. In both videos, Putin appeared to be sitting in the same spot at the same table, wearing the same outfit: a black blazer with a white dress shirt and a maroon tie. Multiple Ukrainian cities were hit by shelling after Russian President Vladmir Putin announced a full-scale military invasion. Emergency workers evacuated injured people from damaged apartment buildings. The similar attire and location prompted speculation that the declaration of a military assault against Ukraine had been taped earlier. Some analysts cited metadata from an official video as evidence that the address was pretaped. However, Aric Toler, an analyst with the publication Bellingcat, said that this was based on data from a different video and that the Kremlin video's data showed a creation date of February 24, leaving it unclear when the video was filmed. Other elements of Russia's actions on Ukraine have been scrutinized over apparent timing discrepancies. Documents from separatist leaders in Luhansk and Donetsk requesting aid from Russia made public on Wednesday bore signatures from the day before. The Kremlin also acknowledged that a dramatic Security Council meeting in Moscow this week about deciding whether to recognize the separatist regions as independent states had been recorded five hours before it was broadcast. At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council late on Wednesday, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, delivered a searing response to Putin's action. ""About 48 minutes ago, your president declared war on Ukraine,"" Kyslytsya said to Russia's ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya. Hours after Putin's declaration on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said the country was being targeted by airstrikes.   Read the original article on Business Insider",World/INSIDER,"Putin announced attacks against Ukraine on Thursday in the same suit he wore for his Monday speech, prompting speculation that his war declaration was pretaped",https://news.yahoo.com/putin-announced-attacks-against-ukraine-051653025.html
2/25/2022,"A retired police SWAT commander testified Thursday that he fatally shot a man in a movie theater eight years ago during an argument sparked by cellphone usage and escalated by a thrown popcorn bag because he feared he was about to be attacked by an “out-of-control” person who “looked like a monster.” Curtis Reeves, a 79-year-old former Tampa police captain, said he shot 43-year-old Chad Oulson on Jan. 13, 2014, because the younger, fitter man was cursing at him and about to attack him because he had complained about Oulson's cellphone use during previews. Testifying in Pasco County, north of Tampa, Reeves said he fired his .380 handgun because he believed he had no other choice, saying his seated position, his then-71 years and his poor health made it impossible to defend himself. He said something hit him in the face. He believes it was Oulson's cellphone; prosecutors say video shows Oulson grabbed Reeves' popcorn bag from his lap and tossed it at him. “He was so much above me and so full of rage ... that he was going to strike me with all the strength that he could put together. I figured this was the end of the line for me,” said Reeves, who faces a life sentence if convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Oulson's widow, Nicole Oulson, glared at Reeves throughout his testimony, rocking slightly back and forth. Her finger nearly severed by the bullet that killed her husband as she tried to get him to sit down, she testified earlier she never heard him curse at Reeves. She said Reeves started the argument by ordering her husband to put away his cellphone as he checked on their 22-month-old daughter at day care. Another witness testified that after firing the shot, Reeves muttered, “Throw popcorn in my face.” His defense invoked Florida’s “stand your ground,” which allows use of deadly force in the face of mortal danger or fear of serious injury, but that was rejected by Circuit Judge Susan Barthle. Since the shooting, Reeves has mostly been on house arrest as his attorneys’ arguments and the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the trial. Under questioning by his attorney Richard Escobar, Reeves testified Thursday that he and his wife, Vivian, had arrived early to see the Afghan War movie “Lone Survivor,” sitting in the back row. The Oulsons were sitting one row in front, slightly to Reeves' right. Dressed in a gray suit and speaking in a clear, calm voice, Reeves said as the previews began, he asked Oulson politely to put down his cellphone because it was shining in his eyes. He said Oulson cursed at him and refused. Turning periodically to face jurors, as police officers are trained, Reeves said he was not angry, but decided to head to the lobby and report Oulson to the manager. After he returned to his seat, he said Oulson glared at him and seemed to be speaking loudly to his wife or the audience in general. Reeves said he tried to “defuse the situation” by telling Oulson that if he had known he would put his phone away, he would not have involved the manager. He said he turned away, but when he looked back Oulson had stood up, he saw a reflection and something hit him in the glasses, knocking them askew. He believes Oulson threw his cellphone because it was found on the floor near Reeves' feet. Reeves said Oulson stood over him, “yelling a lot of profanities and threats."" “The F-word seemed to be his primary vocabulary,” using the word as part of a threat to beat him, Reeves said. “He is very volatile and active. He is trying to come over the seats. “I am looking up at this guy and he looked like a monster,” Reeves said. He said Nicole Oulson tried to hold her husband back, but Chad Oulson appeared ready to strike. “I was completely defenseless,” Reeves said. “I have never encountered someone exhibiting that amount of uncontrolled anger and rage.” He pulled his gun from his pocket and fired once, fatally striking Oulson in the chest. Sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested Reeves. Reeves appeared less confident under cross-examination by prosecutor Scott Rosenwasser, often struggling to understand and answer questions. Rosenwasser repeatedly tried to show Reeves was not as debilitated as he claimed, pointing out that shortly before the shooting he went on an archery hunting trip where he walked uphill and climbed 10 feet (3 meters) up a tree. Reeves also conceded that someone cannot shoot another person who simply threw a harmless item at them and that he had rejected his wife's suggestion that they move away from the Oulsons. Rosenwasser spent significant time with Reeves going through security video of the shooting, trying to show that the reflection Reeves saw just before shooting was light bouncing off reflective material on his own shoe.

2/25/2022,"Hours after eating leftovers from a restaurant, a 19-year-old was admitted to the hospital with multiple organ failure and later had both his legs and all his fingers amputated. The Massachusetts college student had eaten rice, chicken and lo mein from a restaurant. Soon after, he felt abdominal pain and his skin turned a shade of purple, according to a report by The New England Journal of Medicine. The teenager was admitted to a hospital for ""shock, multiple organ failure, and rash,” and his condition quickly declined. He experienced abnormal breathing, high blood pressure and vomiting. The student had been healthy overall with regular drinking and smoking habits, the report said. After further tests, he was diagnosed with meningococcal purpura fulminan disease, which caused his stiff neck, nausea, respiratory collapse, shock and organ failure, according to the report. Purpura fulminan is a rare complication that comes with septic shock, which the college student experience, according to the report. Throw those leftovers away: What to know about storing rice, noodles Alzheimer’s patients 'devastated': Alzheimer’s patients 'devastated' at Medicare limits on drug critics say need more testing The condition is caused by bacteria and brings symptoms such as sudden fever and vomiting. The Centers for Disease and Control Prevention warns it can “lead to death in as little as a few hours.” Over the course of his hospital stay, his condition worsened and he developed necrosis, the death of tissue and cells. At that point, doctors had to amputate his legs and fingers, according to the report. He also needed a pacemaker for 13 days to treat his cardiac dysfunction. Experts have warned against the dangers of improperly storing leftover rice because items such as rice and pasta contain a bacterium called Bacillus cereus. The bacteria produces a toxin when heated and left out too long, according to the CDC. In 2008, a teenager died in his sleep after eating leftover pasta that wasn't refrigerated overnight, a case that was reported in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. The medical team learned that although the Massachusetts student had received a first dose of the meningococcal vaccine, he never received the recommended booster. His roommate also ate the leftover food and vomited but didn't have life-threatening reactions.

2/25/2022,"On Wednesday afternoon, just hours before Vladimir Putin launched a long-planned attack on Ukraine, a top White House official joined Yahoo Finance Live to preview the planned sanctions against Russia. Daleep Singh, White House Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, underlined that the plan will be wide-ranging — and that crucial American economic allies will be on board to make the measures stick. His comments echo those made by White House press secretary Jen Psaki during her daily briefing on Wednesday afternoon. “What people need to understand is that we follow a set of guiding principles when we think about sanctions,” said Singh, who also serves as Deputy Director of the National Economic Council. “We're not cowboys applying arbitrary and capricious sanctions to the rest of the world.” President Joe Biden will provide more details early Thursday afternoon in a speech to the nation. In a statement Wednesday night, Biden said, “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.” On energy spikes as a result of the war, Singh underlined that American consumers will face higher prices — but he said the costs to Russia will be much higher. Russia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas and third-largest producer of crude oil. Singh said the U.S. sanctions wouldn't be designed to stop Russia oil exports — rather, cutting off the spigot there would be Putin’s choice. “It would be a terrible mistake for Russia to weaponize its oil supply,” he said. ""[Russia] depends on oil and gas revenues for its exports and for the Russian government's budget revenues.” If gas prices do spike more, one option would be releasing more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to alleviate prices, Psaki noted Wednesday. The sanctions to come are also set to focus largely on Russian finances — with more Russian financial institutions set to be targeted — as well as limits on the country's imports. For weeks, the Biden administration has suggested it could deploy export controls. Those controls would aim to ban foreign and domestic companies from sending Russia sought-after products like high-tech semiconductors. Speaking to Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Singh attempted to address a key question about those proposed sanctions. Can the White House actually exert influence in this area when 100% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors are manufactured overseas? Indeed, three-quarters of global chip manufacturing capacity is now concentrated in East Asia. The rules “can only work in tandem with our allies and partners in Europe, but also in Asia,"" Singh acknowledged. “We know almost all of the leading-edge semiconductor chips are produced in Taiwan and Korea and what this rule allows us to do is to move in lockstep with our European partners as well as our Asian partners.” While U.S.-based companies like Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) would fall directly under the controls, the focus in the coming weeks and months will likely be on whether companies like Samsung (based in South Korea) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company comply. The overall plan, says Singh, is “what we'll create is a negative feedback loop, a vicious feedback loop between capital outflows, a weaker currency, imported inflation, higher imported inflation, a hit to Russia's purchasing power, lower investment, and lower growth.” Ben Werschkul is a writer and producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.

Johnson couldn’t tell McClatchy News if Walker suffered any injures. He said that the blood and fluids oozing from the truck were likely due to decomposition since Walker’s body had been there for an estimated several days.

2/25/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The chief of the German army vented his frustration over what he sees as the long-running neglect of military readiness in his country in an unusual public rant a few hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, adding that the army was in bad shape. Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea on Thursday, confirming the worst fears of the West with the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. ""In my 41th year of peace-time service, I would not have thought that I would have to experience a war,"" Lieutenant General Alfons Mais said on LinkedIn on Thursday. ""And the Bundeswehr, the army which I have the honour to command, is standing there more or less empty-handed. The options we can offer the government in support of the alliance are extremely limited."" Commentators on LinkedIn praised Mais for his ""brutally honest"" words, many of them backing his veiled criticism of consecutive German governments that have been blamed for not fulfilling NATO's targets for military spending. Germany in January offered to supply 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine to help defend against possible invasion - an offer Kyiv mayor and former world champion boxer Vitali Klitschko dismissed as ""a joke"". ""We have all seen it coming but were not able to get through with our arguments to draw the consequences after (Russia's) annexation of Crimea. This does not feel good. I am fed up with it,"" Mais said in his post. NATO territory had so far not come under direct threat, he said, but Germany's partners in Eastern Europe were feeling constantly rising pressure. ""When, if not now, is the moment to put the Afghanistan mission structurally and with regard to our equipment behind us and overhaul our posture?"" Mais said. ""Otherwise, we will not be able to successfully fulfil our constitutional duty and our obligations in the alliance."" German forces were drastically scaled down after the end of the Cold War, and later trained mainly for missions such as in Afghanistan where the adversary was poorly equipped and not an armed force with the most modern weapons.

2/25/2022,"Many in Russia are shocked to see President Vladimir Putin escalate the country's conflict with Ukraine to a full-scale war, reports The New York Times. Even though Moscow's invasion of Ukraine was not entirely surprising after weeks of increasing military presence along the border, many analysts say some of Putin's strategy is seemingly out of character. ""A number of people in Moscow's foreign policy establishment, where analysts overwhelmingly characterized Mr. Putin's military buildup around Ukraine as an elaborate and astute bluff in recent months, admitted on Thursday that they had monumentally misjudged a man they had spent decades studying,"" writes the Times. Several prominent pundits in Russia had written off the idea of war as ridiculous given Putin's past handling of conflict. One notable change, experts told the Times, is Putin's demeanor after two years of the global pandemic. After Putin's long-term dedication to self-isolating, he ""appeared to become more aggrieved and more emotional, and increasingly spoke about his mission in stark historical terms."" Political scientist Gleb O. Pavlovsky, who was once a close adviser to Putin, said ""he's become an isolated man, more isolated than Stalin was,"" and described being stunned by Putin's ""dark description of Ukraine as a dire threat to Russia,"" per the Times. Another political analyst, Tatiana Stanovaya, agreed Putin has ""become less pragmatic, and more emotional."" After years of projecting calm strength, she and much of the ""ruling elite around"" Putin were astounded by the ""shift"" away from pragmatic strategy. Stanovaya said even Putin's inner circle did not realize Russia was actually hurtling toward war until it was too late. Read more at The New York Times.

2/25/2022,"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The government of economically-battered Syria decided Thursday to cut spending in an effort to reduce the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, concerned that oil and wheat prices could sharply increase, the state-owned news agency said. SANA reported that after an extraordinary Cabinet meeting, officials decided to manage reserves of main staples such as wheat, sugar, cooking oil and rice for the next two months, closely watch the distribution of the commodities and ration them. Syria’s economic minister, Mohammed Samer Khalil, said Crimea offered to export wheat to Syria. He said the Syrian government is considering the offer. SANA said the government also decided to closely monitor the exchange rate and to “ration public spending in a way that only covers priorities during this period.” Syria, struggling after more than a decade of war, relies mostly on wheat imports from Russia and oil shipments from its other ally, Iran. As Russia pounded Ukraine Thursday, Syrian authorities saw danger signs in rising oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic and wholesale prices jumped for heating oil, wheat and other commodities. Russia is a main backer of President Bashar Assad’s government and its military intervention in 2015 helped tip the balance of power in his favor. The Syrian government described the attacks on Ukraine as a “military operation by the Russian allies to preserve their national security and stability.” Russia's war effort turned Syria's government toward managing its own resources. SANA, the state news agency, said the issue was discussed during an extraordinary Cabinet meeting on Thursday about the path forward given the Russian invasion. The decision came as oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped toward or above $100 per barrel to their highest levels since 2014, up more than 6%. Syria's conflict that began in March 2011 has left nearly half a million people dead and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of 23 million people. The war has also led to severe shortages in fuel and wheat. The dollar today is worth about 3,600 Syrian pounds compared with 47 pounds at the start of the conflict. The country's largest oil wells are under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighter in the country’s east, depriving the government access to them. The country’s fertile agricultural areas, where wheat is planted, are also out of government control. Earlier on Thursday, Russia invaded Ukraine, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine’s government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a “full-scale war” that could rewrite the geopolitical order and whose fallout already reverberated around the world. The Syrian government move came hours after the U.N. warned that 14.6 million people are in need of aid in war-torn Syria, an increase of 1.2 million people compared with last year. The report by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs was released late Wednesday. The U.N. and its partners are reaching 7 million people every month, “but more support is required,” tweeted Mark Cutts, the U.N.

Find: 5 Smartest Things To Do With Your Spare Change The U.S. Sun recently reported that a rare quarter — minted in the year 2000 with an error on it — has sold for $216 on eBay. The coin is part of the state Washington quarters series featuring New Hampshire, but it was struck onto a Jefferson nickel. But that’s not the most expensive rare coin, the U.S. Sun reports. Rare Washington quarters minted in 1932 can sell for as much as $13,573, according to USA Coin Book. Errors and rare mintages give coins the highest re-sale value, per The U.S. Sun.

Error coins — like the Washington quarter which recently sold for $216 — are sometimes called double denominations or “planchet” errors. That’s because the mistake occurs to a blank coin (a “planchet”) during the minting process. The U.S. Sun explained that errors can happen when the wrong planchet is fed into the minting press, or the machine contains dies of different denominations, and a mix-up occurs. If you are the type of person who tosses your spare change into a jar, bowl, or piggy bank in your home, it could be worth sorting through your coins to see if you have any of value. If you don’t have a place where you keep your spare change, it’s worth searching under couch cushions, in your car, and anywhere change could collect.

2/25/2022,"Kenya’s permanent representative to the United Nations (UN) on Feb. 21 gave a scathing condemnation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, comparing it to colonialism in Africa. In a statement to the UN Security Council at an emergency meeting to discuss Russia’s decision to recognize the breakaway Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, Martin Kimani said Russia’s move breaches the territorial integrity of Ukraine and pointed out that Africa itself has had to contend with borders created by colonial powers because of the greater goal of peace. What is China’s stand on the Russia-Ukraine conflict? “Kenya, and almost every African country, was birthed by the ending of empire,” he said. “Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris, and Lisbon with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart.” Gabon and Ghana are the other African countries that also spoke out against Moscow’s actions in Ukraine. Martin Kimani, Kenya’s permanent representative to the United Nations. India’s banking loopholes paved the way for a shipbuilder’s $3 billion default Russia and Ukraine are embroiled in a crisis involving Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine’s east. Separatists backed by Russia in the regions broke away from Ukraine in 2014 and the two became self-proclaimed “people’s republics.” Putin claims that eastern Ukraine is ancient Russian land, and on Feb. 21 decided “to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic.” On Feb. 22, Russia ordered ordered “peacekeeping” forces into Donetsk and Luhansk, fuelling fears of war in Europe. Until 1991, Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union, a socialist state that had spanned Eurasia since 1922. The two countries and 13 others emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Kimani’s colonialism analogy stems from the controversial drawing of African borders by colonial powers. European powers imposed the ideas of states and borders on Africans by creating artificial boundaries based on resources and their other interests and with limited knowledge history and the ethnic composition of the continent. At independence, African states decided to stick with the colonial borders to avoid conflict. There have been disputes and changes since, such as Eritrea separating from Ethiopia in 1993 and South Sudan seceding from Sudan in 2011. But the continent’s borders have largely remained intact. “Rather than form nations that looked ever backward into history with a dangerous nostalgia, we chose to look forward to a greatness none of our many nations and peoples had ever known,” Kimani said. “We chose to follow the rules of the OAU (Organisation of African Unity) and the United Nations charter not because our borders satisfied us but because we wanted something greater forged in peace.” Sign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech, and innovation in your inbox.

2/25/2022,"By David Lawder and Jason Lange WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is poised to unleash a wider array of sanctions against Russia if Moscow escalates the conflict in Ukraine, denying key Russian financial institutions and companies access to U.S. dollar transactions and global markets for trade, energy exports and financing. But the United States and its allies have never before attempted to cut a $1.5 trillion economy out of global commerce, and it is unclear how much pressure even unified Western sanctions can put on Moscow. A review of World Bank and United Nations trade data shows that since lesser sanctions were imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea, China has emerged as its biggest export destination. New sanctions could prompt Russia to try to deepen its non-dollar denominated trade ties with Beijing in an effort to skirt the restrictions, said Harry Broadman, a former U.S. trade negotiator and World Bank official with China and Russia experience. ""The problem with sanctions, especially involving an oil producer, which is what Russia is, will be leakage in the system,"" Broadman said. ""China may say, 'We're going to buy oil on the open market and if it's Russian oil, so be it.'"" GRAPHIC - Russia's top export destinations https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/dwpkrlgjavm/chart.png Under an executive order signed by President Joe Biden on Monday, any institution in Russia's financial services sector is a target for further sanctions, the White House said, noting that more than 80% of Russia's daily foreign exchange transactions and half its trade are conducted in dollars. Biden, in announcing an initial raft of sanctions on Tuesday to penalize Russia for ordering troops into two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, said he would ""take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours."" That may be easier said than done, with Russia among the world's top exporters of oil, natural gas, copper, aluminum, palladium and other important commodities. Oil prices hit new highs not seen since 2014 on Tuesday. Russia accounted for 1.9% of global trade in 2020, down from 2.8% in 2013, according to the World Bank data. Its 2020 GDP 11th globally, between Brazil and South Korea. A review of Russian trade data in the World Bank's World International Trade Solution database shows that Russia's dependence on trade has declined over the past 20 years. GRAPHIC - Trade as a share of Russia's economy https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/TRADE/lgpdwamqmvo/chart.png Russia's export destinations have changed as well. The Netherlands was the top export destination a decade ago, due to oil trade, but it has been supplanted in that role by China. Germany and Britain's purchases from Russia have held largely steady, while Belarus' imports have risen. China remains Russia's top supplier of imports, with mobile phones, computers, telecommunications gear, toys, textiles, clothing and electronics parts among top categories. Its share of Russian imports has risen since 2014, while those from Germany have declined markedly. Ukraine's exports to China fell markedly over the past decade, while Belarus' shipments have changed little. Ukraine's top exports to Russia in 2020 were aluminum oxide, railway equipment, coal, steel and uranium, according to the World Bank data.
