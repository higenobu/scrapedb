1/24/2022,"Two fans of No Time to Die star Ana de Armas have started legal action against the studio behind the Richard Curtis-scripted comedy Yesterday, claiming they were duped into renting it after the US trailer contained a brief glimpse of her despite her character having been cut out of the finished film. A class action lawsuit was filed on 21 January in a California court by Conor Woulfe and Peter Michael Rosza alleging that Universal Pictures, the film’s US distributors, were “false, misleading, and deceptive” for releasing the trailer for the film, on which both claimants said they subsequently each spent $3.99 to watch on Amazon.  Yesterday stars Himesh Patel as a singer-songwriter who, after a mysterious global electrical blackout, is the only person who remembers the Beatles (and their songs); De Armas appears for a few seconds in the trailer while Patel sings the Beatles’ 1969 hit Something. In 2019 Curtis told CinemaBlend that her character was cut because test audiences felt that it undermined the central romance between Patel’s Jack and Lily James’s character Ellie. “‘[De Armas] was brilliant … And [that] turned out to be the problem [as] the audience did not like the fact that his eyes even strayed. Because then some people would go, ‘Oh, he really doesn’t deserve her. He really doesn’t deserve Lily.’” The lawsuit claims that Patel and James were “largely unknown” actors and that the distributors “could not rely on their fame to promote the movie to entice viewership” and instead “used Ms De Armas’s fame, radiance and brilliance to promote the film … Ms De Armas, in contrast to the actors playing Jack Malik or Ellie, is famous and is a viewership draw by herself.” De Armas, who was born in Cuba, plays CIA agent Paloma in the current James Bond release No Time to Die, and previously gained attention as the hologram Joi in Blade Runner 2049.

1/24/2022,"Even while deflated in defeat, Alex de Minaur tried to maintain his “positive vibes” mantra. It has been one oft-repeated at this tournament, and one he intends to carry with him throughout 2022.  On Monday, though, he allowed himself a small amount of frustration. The 22-year-old had threatened a deep run into the Australian Open, having made the fourth round for the first time in his burgeoning career. He had dropped only one set on his way there and was confident heading into Rod Laver Arena. Unfortunately for him Jannik Sinner had other ideas, which materialised in some big hitting and, eventually, a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-4 victory for the rising Italian star. At times De Minaur was his own worst enemy, creating eight break points but only converting one. “I think second set I had break points first game of the second set, and I didn’t convert kind of again,” he said. “So I think after that point I was maybe 0-6 on break points. And look, he started to lift his level as the court kind of had shade. There was no more sun, so he was able to really hit the ball through the court a lot more. “We all know the amazing firepower he has, so I felt like I played a loose game to get broken … he got the early break and kind of was able to run away. I still had a lot of chances on his service games. It just didn’t feel like it was coming.” Sinner is unbeaten in 2022, having emerged flawlessly from the ATP Cup and dropped only one set en route to the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park. The 20-year-old world No 10 will next play either fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas or American Taylor Fritz with an eye to a maiden grand slam semi-final appearance. De Minaur will take his “bittersweet ending” to his tournament and take learnings into the rest of the year. That begins next month at the Rotterdam Open, meaning he will likely return to his home away from home in Alicante, Spain, before a possible return to Australia in March for the Davis Cup qualifying round against Hungary. “It’s been a good start to the season bringing in some good momentum and I came up short today but I’m happy with where my level is going,” De Minaur said. “It’s definitely a big improvement from last year and I’m excited for what’s to come. “I knew I’d put in the work to really come out here and perform, so the goals kind of stay the same. I still want to keep improving, keep striving to get the most out of myself. That’s never going to change. That’s just the person I am, and in a way it’s how I’ve gotten to where I have gotten, just by constantly pushing myself. “So we’ll reflect on what I did well, what I can still improve, and we go again until the next tournament … it’s a long year, but my hopes and goals are to keep at least my attitude and my mindset throughout the whole year, or try to. It’s easier said than done, but that’s the focus.”",Sport/Sport,De Minaur exits Australian Open in frustrating straight-sets loss to Sinner,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/de-minaur-exits-australian-open-in-frustrating-straight-sets-loss-to-sinner
1/24/2022,"Enabled by Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, a united front of US Senate Republicans dealt American democracy a massive blow last week by blocking the Freedom to Vote: John R Lewis Act. The US Senate: a place where desperately needed federal voting rights legislation goes to die – a spectacle unworthy of what Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin called “the world’s greatest deliberative body”. Raskin was referring to the Senate’s reputation not necessarily in an affirmative, but in an aspirational way: he wanted to issue a challenge to the senators to live up to this glorious notion. Nevertheless, the mythical idea of the Ssenate as “the world’s greatest deliberative body” is widely held among the country’s political elite – the kind of American exceptionalism that still very much warps the perspective on US history and politics.  What we really need to grapple with is the fact that the current situation is not just a disgraceful aberration from the Senate’s supposedly noble past and true character. In some fundamental ways, the Senate is working as intended. It has always been one of the most powerful undemocratic distortions in the political system – and not by accident, but because that’s what it was designed to be. So far, much of the attention has focused on the filibuster as the most blatantly undemocratic tool of obstruction. It is true that the frequency of filibuster use has increased dramatically in recent years. Still, what Republicans did last week was well in line with the longer-term historical norm. The filibuster has consistently been an instrument of white Christian domination: during the 20th century, it was used predominantly to block civil rights legislation and measures such as anti-lynching bills. Since the filibuster was not part of the Senate’s original design and only came to be by accident in the early 19th century, it is tempting to portray it as the real culprit – a stain on an otherwise admirable institution. Let’s remember, however, that just like the electoral college, the Senate was always intended to be a layer of insulation between those in power and the people – which is why senators were initially appointed by state legislatures. The senate was supposed to help stave off what many of the founders saw as the “threat” of too much democracy. So, what we see today is not just an institution hijacked by a radicalized Republican party (although it is that too) – but an institution badly in need of structural reform that should go well beyond getting rid of the filibuster. In the current political situation, reforming the Senate, just like protecting voting rights, is considered a “partisan” idea – and it is, but only because democracy itself has become a partisan issue. Of the two major parties, only the Democratic party is a democratic party. Let’s be specific about how undemocratic an institution this is – something that is best captured in numbers: in the current 50:50 Senate, Democratic senators represent 40 million more voters; by about 2040, 70% of the country will be represented by just 30 senators, while less than one third of the electorate will get to determine 70 out of 100 members of the Senate. The issue of disproportionate representation is deeply intertwined with the problem of white Christian patriarchal rule. The Senate privileges conservative white voters who dominate in small, less populous states, it is biased towards white people, with or without the filibuster. Here are two more numbers everyone should know: out of about 2,000 US senators in the country’s history, 11 have been Black. Over 150 years since the civil war, over half a century since the civil rights legislation of the 1960s – 11 Black senators. And to date, 58 women have served in the Senate. Over a century since Congress passed the 19th amendment, finally granting women the right to vote – 58 female senators. Whenever someone says the Senate is “the world’s greatest deliberative body,” remember that it is deliberately and inherently undemocratic – an anti-democratic distortion that stands in the way of America finally realizing the promise of multiracial, pluralistic democracy. The legislation Republicans are blocking in the Senate is the minimum needed to push back against the state-level authoritarian onslaught on the system. But beyond such immediate measures, a more structural approach to democracy reform is required – and Congress’s upper chamber needs to be at the center of those debates. America can have the Senate in its current form or liberal democracy, but probably not both. The good news is that serious reform is eminently possible. There certainly is no filibuster requirement in the US constitution, and there are ways to alleviate the Senate’s anti-democratic character – by adding DC and Puerto Rico as states, for instance. The tension between white male elite rule and aspirations of true democracy has always shaped the American project, it is inherent in the nation’s founding documents and its political system. The existing institutional order is in conflict with the promise that all people deserve to participate as equals in a democratic polity – and that situation requires a decision. “The world’s greatest deliberative body”? If it were true, it would be quite the indictment of the world’s other deliberative chambers. Let’s abandon such vestiges of mythical exceptionalism that make it harder to acknowledge the anti-democratic threats and deficiencies in American politics and culture. The fact that a shrinking minority of white conservatives is consistently being enabled to hold on to power against the will of the majority of voters is destined to cause a massive legitimacy crisis. And unless the system is properly democratized, it is only going to get worse.

Nowadays, it means something different to those who grew up with it (vinyl records in general) from what it does to those who have only known digital music. Now, an individual record can be “a vinyl”, creating a generation gap reminiscent of the Not the Nine O’Clock News sketch that today comes across as a curious period piece. We’ve talked before about how the guitar became an “acoustic guitar” after the appearance of its electrical cousin. Likewise the “conventional oven”, “corn on the cob”, and so on. If the usual pattern had been followed, we would now have an expression such as “circular album” or “flat song”. I can’t think of another example; no one calls, say, a conventional cigarette “a tobacco”. Can you think of one? And have you spotted any evidence in the wild of “vinyl” as a verb? Incidentally, anyone tempted to harrumph at “vinyls” should check that they have never said “three-album boxed set” or “double album”, since the original albums were, as the name suggests, very much collections of records rather than individual discs.

1/24/2022,"This weekend’s March for Life rally, the large anti-choice demonstration held annually in Washington DC to mark the anniversary of the Roe v Wade decision, has the exuberant quality of a victory lap. This, the 49th anniversary of Roe, is likely to be its last. The US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health, which is set to be decided this spring. For women in Texas, Roe has already been nullified: the court went out of its way to allow what Justice Sonia Sotomayor called a “flagrantly unconstitutional” abortion ban to go into effect there, depriving abortion rights to the one in 10 American women of reproductive age who live in the nation’s second largest state. These victories have made visible a growing cohort within the anti-choice movement: the militias and explicitly white supremacist groups of the organized far right. Like last year, this year’s March for Life featured an appearance by Patriot Front, a white nationalist group that wears a uniform of balaclavas and khakis. The group, which also marched at a Chicago March for Life demonstration earlier this month, silently handed out cards to members of the press who tried to ask them questions. “America belongs to its fathers, and it is owed to its sons,” the cards read. “The restoration of American sovereignty must follow the restoration of the American Family.”  Explicit white nationalism, and an emphasis on conscripting white women into reproduction, is not a fringe element of the anti-choice movement. Associations between white supremacist groups and anti-abortion forces are robust and longstanding. In addition to Patriot Front, groups like the white nationalist Aryan Nations and the neo-Nazi Traditionalist Worker Party have also lent support to the anti-abortion movement. These groups see stopping abortion as part of a broader project to ensure white hegemony in addition to women’s subordination. Tim Bishop, of the Aryan Nations, noted that “Lots of our people join [anti-choice organizations] … It’s part of our Holy War for the pure Aryan race.” That the growing white nationalist movement would be focused on attacking women’s rights is maybe to be expected: research has long established that recruitment to the alt-right happens largely among men with grievances against feminism, and that misogyny is usually the first form of rightwing radicalization. But the affinity goes both ways: just as the alt right loves the anti-choice movement, the anti-choice movement loves the alt right. In 2019, Kristen Hatten, a vice-president at the anti-choice group New Wave Feminists, shared racist content online and publicly identified herself as an “ethnonationalist”. In addition to sharing personnel, the groups share tactics. In 1985, the KKK began circulating “Wanted” posters featuring the photos and personal information of abortion providers. The posters were picked up by the anti-choice terrorist group Operation Rescue in the early 90s. Now, sharing names, photos, and addresses of abortion providers and clinic staff is standard practice in the mainline anti-choice movement, and the stalking and doxing of providers has become routine. More recently, anti-abortion activists have escalated their violence, returning to the murderous extremism that characterized the movement in the 1990s: In Knoxville, a fire that burned down a planned parenthood clinic on New Year’s Eve was ruled an arson. Maybe the anti-choice crowd is taking tips from their friends in the alt right. It’s not that the anti-abortion movement’s embrace of white nationalism is totally uncomplicated. When the Traditionalist Worker Party showed up at a Tennessee Right to Life march in 2018, the organizers shooed them off, and later issued a statement saying they condemned violence both from the right, and from left wing groups like “antifa”. Hatten was fired from her anti-choice job after a public outcry. The anti-choice movement has even started trying to appropriate the language of social justice. They posit “equality” between embryos and women, try to brand abortion bans as “feminist”, incessantly compare abortion to the Holocaust, and claim that abortion is “an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation”, in the words of supreme court Justice Clarence Thomas. Anti-choice groups are eager to claim the moral authority of historical struggles against oppression, even as they work to further the oppression of women. But the link between the anti-choice movement and white supremacy is much older and more fundamental than this recent, superficial social justice branding effort. Before an influx of southern and eastern European immigrants to the United States in the latter half of the 19th century, abortion and contraception had only been partially and sporadically criminalized. This changed in the early 20th century, when an additional surge of migrants from Asia and Latin America calcified white American racial anxieties and led to white elites decrying the falling white birth rate as “race suicide”. Abortion bans were quickly introduced nationwide. As the historian Leslie Raegan put it, “White male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white Protestant women.” The emerging popular eugenics movement supported this campaign of forced birth for “fit” mothers, while at the same time implementing a widespread campaign of involuntary sterilization among the poor, particularly Black women and incarcerated women. Meanwhile, white women who sought out voluntary sterilization were discouraged or outright denied the procedure, a practice that is still mainstream in the medical field today. In the current anti-choice and white supremacist alliance, the language of “race suicide” has been supplanted by a similar fear: the so-called “Great Replacement”, a racist conspiracy theory that posits that white Americans are being “replaced” by people of color. (Some antisemitic variations posit that this “replacement” is somehow being orchestrated by Jewish people.) That the way to combat this, the right says, is to force childbearing among white people, to severely restrict immigration, and to punish, via criminalization and enforced poverty, women of color. These anxieties have always animated the anti-choice movement, and they have only become more fervent among the March for Life’s rank and file as conservatives become increasingly fixated on the demographic changes that will make America a minority-white country sometime in the coming decades. The white supremacist and anti-choice movements have always been closely linked. But more and more, they are becoming difficult to tell apart.

1/24/2022,"Just under a year ago, right in the heat of another Australian summer, Danielle Collins was reduced to a level of pain that she would not wish on another soul. By the third set of her match against Daria Kasatkina in the Philip Island Trophy, an event held at Melbourne Park during the second week of the Australian Open, she fell to the ground while severely cramping in her abdominal muscles and pelvis. Through her pained tears, Collins had to resort to hitting underarm serves and throwing up desperate moonballs but she fell 6-1 in the final set. A week later, she withdrew from a tournament in Adelaide with severe back pain that flared up around her cycle but would not show up on MRI scans.  One year on, Collins has returned to the scene of those brutal moments and on Monday she continued one of the most impressive and heartening stories in the sport by reaching the quarter-final of the Australian Open, defeating Elise Mertens 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in nearly three hours. During those days when Collins was in constant pain, she did not know what was causing it. Her consultations with doctors all yielded the same unconvincing responses - that her period pains were normal and that anti-inflammatory medicine would help. Eventually, they did not. Her health became progressively worse and in April 2021, Collins underwent emergency surgery to treat endometriosis. Endometriosis is an extremely painful condition in which tissue similar to the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of it, and affects an estimated one in ten women. For Collins, it marked the second major health diagnosis of her short professional career as she also was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2018, an autoimmune disease that causes painful swelling in the joints. “Super satisfying and rewarding,” said Collins of her quarter-final run a year on. “Because I think any time you’re going to have a surgery like I had, I think any athlete would find it less than ideal and nerve-racking knowing how your body is going to recover after that type of surgery. It’s extremely painful and scary.” Despite all of the obstacles before her, an athlete fighting her own body, Collins continues to rise. Since returning to the court following her surgery, her quality of life has improved significantly and she has played some of her best tennis of her career. Collins is a former Australian Open semi-finalist but she has never been as consistent as in recent months. She won her first two WTA titles in consecutive weeks last summer and since mid July she has compiled a 27-6 (82%) record. “Before my surgery and before I was on the proper medication, I was always having to adjust my training around my cycle, because of how painful my periods were,” said Collins. “And now with things being more consistent, I’m able to kind of train more consistently and not have to have such drastic changes, especially the week of my cycle.” On Monday, Mertens and Collins duelled in a deciding set of the highest quality. Collins is armed with one of the most destructive, versatile two-handed backhands in the game and she combines her high-octane shotmaking with dynamic athleticism. With the match finely balanced at 4-4, 30-30 in the final set, Collins took control. She obliterated winners off both forehand and backhand wings, punctuating them with trademark cries of: “Come on” as she successfully reached her third career major quarter-final. “I’m just very relieved that the surgery went well for me, and that now I’m able to perform more consistently from a physical standpoint,” she said. “I think that’s helped me a lot mentally, knowing that. It’s given me a lot more confidence on court. I just feel, as a person, more consistent on a day-to-day basis, because I’m not having such terrible fluctuations and such painful, really just awful days around those periods.” Collins is a singular character in professional tennis and her exuberance on the court has not always meshed well with everyone. But the fire she exhibits on court is the exact same toughness that has allowed her to face the many obstacles before her and keep moving on.",Sport/Sport,Danielle Collins ends year of pain with quarter-final place in Australian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/danielle-collins-ends-year-of-pain-with-quarter-final-place-in-australian-open-tennis
1/24/2022,"Good morning. As fears of a Russian invasion are heightening in Ukraine, the US and UK are withdrawing diplomats’ families.  The US state department told the dependents of staffers at its embassy in Kyiv that they must leave the country. It also said non-essential embassy staff could leave Ukraine at government expense. The EU has said their dependents will stay put for now. US officials said the embassy would remain open and Sunday’s announcement did not constitute an evacuation. The move had been under consideration for some time and did not reflect an easing of US support for Ukraine, they said. What’s happening in Ukraine? There are rising tensions about Russia’s military buildup on the Ukraine border that have not been eased during talks between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva. What has the US embassy said? “Military action by Russia could come at any time,” a statement said. Officials “will not be in a position to evacuate American citizens in such a contingency, so US citizens currently present in Ukraine should plan accordingly”, it added. Stormy Daniels, the porn actor who catapulted herself and the lawyer Michael Avenatti to fame with lawsuits against Donald Trump, will have a starring role in a court in Manhattan when prosecutors try to prove the attorney cheated her of $300,000 in book proceeds. Daniels’ testimony in the federal court will be pivotal for prosecutors trying to prove Avenatti engaged in wire fraud and aggravated identity theft to keep from giving his client money he had received from her publisher. Opening statements are to be made on Monday. Daniels is not expected to testify until Tuesday, at the earliest. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to the charges in what will be his third criminal trial in two years. What has the once popular lawyer said? After his arrest, Avenatti stated in Twitter posts that no money related to Daniels was ever misappropriated or mishandled and that he mostly worked unpaid for Daniels with an agreement that he would receive a proportion of any book proceeds. He said he looked “forward to a jury hearing the evidence”. Tonga has previously been hit by several natural disasters but residents have never experienced anything like the last week. On Saturday 15 January, at 5,10pm local time, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai undersea volcano erupted in a blast 600 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It could be felt as far as away as New Zealand and Alaska, and triggered a tsunami. “We’ve experienced tropical cyclones but this is so new and no one will ever forget this, ever,” said Marian Kupu, a journalist for BroadCom Broadcasting FM87.5 in Tonga. “We didn’t know what to do or what to expect.” There had been signs that something was wrong. All summer there was a stench of sulphur in the air across Tonga, signalling that the undersea volcano, which lies about 65km north-west of the country’s capital of Nuku’alofa, was active. There had been small eruptions, and on the Friday, the day before the eruption and tsunami, the water in Nuku’alofa’s harbor was spinning in eddies and whirlpools, something no one had seen before. How many people have died? So far, three people have been reported dead in Tonga as a result of the tsunami, while two others drowned in Peru after abnormally big waves from the blast reached the coast of South America. Conservative groups across the US, often linked to deep-pocketed rightwing donors, are waging a campaign to ban books from school libraries, often focussed on works that address race, LGBTQ issues or marginalized communities. Librarians and teachers warn the trend is on the increase. The trial of three former police officers involved in the George Floyd murder begins today. Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane face their turn in the courtroom after the former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering Floyd. A senior French surgeon faces legal action after attempting to sell an X-ray of a victim shot during the Bataclan attack in Paris. The item was on sale for about $2,776 on the OpenSea website, which specializes in so-called NFT digital images. The surgeon, Emmanuel Masmejean, says the attempted sale was a mistake. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, is facing calls to launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party after the former minister Nusrat Ghani said she was told her “Muslimness” was making colleagues uncomfortable. Covid cases are rising rapidly among US nursing home residents and staff, causing shortages in admissions, exacerbating bed shortages at hospitals, and in some cases requiring the national guard to be called in. There were more than 31,500 cases among nursing home residents in the week ending 9 January, nearly as many as last winter’s peak, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Cases among staff are even higher – more than double last year’s highest record, with more than 57,000 confirmed cases in the week of 9 January, a tenfold increase in three weeks. Forty years after his breakthrough role in Little House on the Prairie, Jason Bateman is thrilling TV audiences as a drug cartel money launderer. But he almost threw his career away by indulging in all-night booze and drug binges in the 90s. “Having thought, ‘This is really fun’, and staying at the party a little bit too long, I’d lost my place in line in the business; it was a case of trying to claw that back towards the end of the 90s, and not getting a lot of great responses.” Before the 1950s, as many as 1,000 rhinos roamed the grasslands and forests of Nepal. But by 1965, rampant hunting, poaching and changes in land use brought the species close to extinction in the country. The national park was established in 1973 and thanks to concerted conservation efforts the rhino population began to bounce back. But a new threat has emerged. Police officers called to a Maryland residence by a concerned neighbour found a 49-year-old man dead – and surrounded by more than 125 venomous and non-venomous snakes held in tanks on racks. The discovery by Charles county sheriff’s deputies and emergency responders at the house in Pomfret became even more bizarre when they established that none of the reptiles, including a 4.3-metre (14ft) Burmese python, had escaped or were slithering free.

We never found out how the message was relayed, but assumed it was a knock on the wall or a secret bell. Then, when you asked for the bill, la signora Maria would come over with her pad, unclip the ballpoint from her housecoat pocket and do the sums between the oil and crumbs on a paper cloth. There was a time when we’d go to Trattoria Zampagna in San Paolo at least once a month. Occasionally it was my idea, but generally it was Vincenzo who pushed for lunch at Maria’s. He loved everything about the place. Its form, function, frank attitude and the steady food from local ingredients. And the fact that it was always full of the mechanics who work under the arches farther down Via Ostiense. There was a menu, but between the daily specials and limited quantities, it was usually better just to let Maria tell you there were three portions of lasagne, two of breadcrumbed cutlets and one of pollo dorato left.  Portions were served with two courses in mind: a pasta or minestra primo and a meat or fish secondo, with vegetables on the side – cicoria, dice-sized roast potatoes or broccolo romanesco. Chartreuse-green and fantastically fractal, broccolo romanesco is more closely related to cauliflower than to tree broccoli, although sweeter and nuttier. If there was pollo dorato (golden chicken) on the menu, I had that. Like the coffee, I never found out how they got skin that was not just crisp but shattering over such tender flesh; I assume it was roasted and then finished in a pan. The broccolo was boiled, and testament to well-salted water. On the other side of Rome, in a restaurant run by Francesca Barreca and Marco Baccanelli, they also boiled broccoli. In many ways, Mazzo, with its communal table, natural wine and innovation, was a different dimension to Zampagna. In others, it was exactly the same viscerally Roman dimension, with a frank attitude and steady food from local ingredients. I remember with joy the time we got the last portion of triple-dipped and fried cotoletta di broccolo romanesco, a recipe they shared in Laura Lazzaroni’s book, La Nuova Cucina Italiana. Marco and Francesca suggest making your own breadcrumbs by putting three thick slices of good, stale bread in the oven until lightly baked, then pulsing them to rubble in a food processor. I have also used fine crumbs, and am sure panko would work, too. At Mazzo they served their broccoli cutlets with garlic and chive mayonnaise, but they are also great with salted yoghurt or a slice of lemon, and dice-sized roast potatoes are never a bad idea. It is Vincenzo who reminds me, every time we drive past, that Zampagna has changed hands, and that Mazzo has closed, although only until they find a new venue (I am holding out for somewhere on via Ostiense). But, until then, I will boil at home. Serves 4 2 small or 1 medium broccolo romanescoSalt and black pepper2 bay leaves3 juniper berries200g flour3 eggs , beaten200g fine breadcrumbs60g pecorino, or parmesan, gratedOil, for frying Cut away the base of the broccoli and remove the leaves. Cut the head in half through the core, then cut into quarters. Working carefully, and again cutting though the core, cut each quarter into wedges that are 3cm thick at their widest point. Bring a large pan of water, with the bay leaves and juniper berries, in it, to a boil. Add salt, stir, then drop in the broccoli wedges and boil for five to seven minutes, or until the core is tender to the point of a knife. Drain. Prepare three bowls: one of the flour, well seasoned, one of the beaten egg and the third of the breadcrumbs mixed with cheese. Dip the broccoli wedges first in the flour, then in the egg and finally the breadcrumbs, lay the coated wedges on a plate and chill in the fridge for at least 20 minutes, or as long as overnight Bring a deep pan of oil up to 180C, or until a cube of bread sizzles. Working in batches, fry the wedges for four to six minutes, turning them once halfway, or until they are deep gold.

1/24/2022,"American democracy is in a state of emergency. Without federal voting rights legislation, discriminatory voting laws will continue to pass unchallenged and harm millions in their wake. Following the US Senate’s recent failure to pass the Freedom to Vote: John R Lewis Act, civil rights leaders urged senators to continue pressing for the bill. But understanding how deeply the absence of its protections will continue to affect voters is key to the bill’s success. Arguably the most crucial measure of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was section 5’s pre-clearance requirement that states with a recent history of voter discrimination get approval from the justice department before implementing voting changes. However, the US supreme court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v Holder struck down the pre-clearance requirement claiming that voting conditions for racial minorities had improved and that its use was outdated. Since then, numerous states passed laws they had previously abandoned due to the threat of pre-clearance. Other states continued to enact laws restricting voting that were already under way before Shelby. These statutes are so restrictive they would have never seen the light of day if pre-clearance was still intact. New voter suppression laws in Texas, Georgia and Florida are the most recent examples of these efforts.  The Freedom to Vote: John R Lewis Act (FTV) – which combines two previous bills to defend voting rights and democracy more broadly – would restore the section 5 pre-clearance provisions and create protections against the most common obstacles faced by voters. Those of us on the frontlines in the fight for voting rights know the immediate impact these bills would have on our communities. Last year in Iberia parish, a rural community on the Louisiana Gulf coast that is one-third Black, election officials closed eight polling locations – five of which were in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Voters were not properly notified of this change and, even more troubling, the closures were implemented just weeks before an election. At least 20,000 voters were affected, many of whom did not discover their polling location had changed until they arrived at the location they had been voting at for years. Under FTV, election officials would be required to publicly announce all voting changes at least 180 days before an election, allowing voters adequate time to become familiar with their new polling location, secure child or adult care, and notify their employer, if necessary. In Texas, FTV would immediately reduce the challenges voters of colors face. Nearly all the population growth from 2010 to 2020 in Texas was from communities of color, yet the map that the state legislature enacted reduced the number of districts in which voters of color make up the majority of eligible voters. If FTV were enacted, the redrawing of districts would be the responsibility of a non-partisan redistricting commission that would prevent elected officials from choosing their own constituents. States would also not be able to enact racially discriminatory maps without first submitting them for approval to the DoJ. Mississippi, the state with the largest percentage of Black voters, offers no opportunity for early voting and voters must get documents notarized to vote by mail. When every voter is forced to vote in-person on election day, it often leads to long lines at polling sites and heavy traffic. When voters are forced to get signatures on both the application to vote by mail and the ballot itself, it is especially difficult for elderly voters who often live alone to have their ballot counted. In 2020, this requirement’s burden increased dramatically due to the pandemic, particularly for the elderly, whose increased vulnerability to Covid meant attaining these necessary signatures risked exposure. During the 2020 general election, elderly Mississippians were forced to risk their health to vote in person on election day, unless they met the standards for one of the limited qualifications that allowed someone to vote by mail. FTV would require all states to have at least 15 consecutive days of early in-person voting, including two weekends, giving voters in states like Mississippi another option to cast their ballot. Without pre-clearance, states and localities will continue to suppress votes by enacting restrictive voting changes that target voters of color. While we still have section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting practices that dilute minority voting strength, this measure is reactive, meaning advocates can only challenge a voting change after its implementation. However, section 2 was also weakened by the supreme court in 2021 by creating new and additional atextual burdens to the Voting Rights Act’s primary mechanism for challenging voting laws that have a discriminatory result. Until pre-clearance is restored, discriminatory changes will continue to be enacted – and will affect every election. The Senate must act to protect the fundamental right to vote and pass federal voting rights legislation by any means necessary – before it is too late.

1/24/2022,"The bitter arctic blast, which had Minnesota temperatures below 0F last week, didn’t stop protestors from hosting a rally as the three lesser-known police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd faced their turn in the courtroom.  A caravan of two dozen cars occupied the length of the block outside the courthouse in the state capital St Paul last week, as jury selection began in the federal civil rights trial of Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane. Opening statements are expected on Monday, in the second trial of the closely-watched process of legal accountability after white former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, and admitted violating his civil rights in May 2020, sparking the largest racial reckoning in America’s recent history. “The day that George Floyd was killed, in addition to Derek Chauvin as the officer that took George Floyd’s life, there were three other human beings that were there. They wore badges and guns, too. They were officers, too,” local activist Toshira Garraway told the bundled-up protesters standing in a tight circle outside of their cars. She added: “Not one of the four officers that was there had compassion and empathy enough to intervene.” The twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul are now braced for the latest trial. “Today is another milestone in the long, slow journey to justice for George Floyd,” Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer who represented his relatives, said in a statement: “This trial will be another painful experience for the Floyd family, who must once more relive his grueling death in excruciating detail.” It took only one day for 12 jurors and six alternates to be seated in the three former officers’ federal trial inside the heavily-barricaded courthouse. Fifteen minutes away, Chauvin’s murder trial last spring was one of the most momentous social justice cases of the century. “I don’t even count it as justice,” Steve Floyd, a community leader in Minneapolis and no relation to George, said. “I count it as accountability because I look at justice in another way: they [shouldn’t] have done that.” A wide radius of security fences, tight police patrolling and road closures are in operation outside the federal courthouse amid concerns of mass protest. Floyd’s murder ignited huge demonstrations across America and in many other countries, as the US Black Lives Matter movement revived and spread, although some of the protests against police brutality and entrenched racism more widely were often harshly curtailed by the police. Chauvin, 45, and the principal protagonist in Floyd’s death had denied murder at his trial last spring, then, having been convicted and sentenced, pleaded guilty in the additional federal case in December. His case had been separated from that of his three fellow officers earlier on after all four were swiftly arrested and fired in 2020 as the terrible facts of the killing became known. Thao, 35, Kueng, 27, and Lane, 38, have pleaded not guilty in both their civil rights case and their state case accusing them of aiding and abetting murder and, unlike Chauvin, their federal case is up first. The three ex-officers have been indicted by the Department of Justice for willfully depriving George Floyd of his right “to be free from a police officer’s deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs”, according to the charges. Thao and Kueng are also accused of willfully failing to “intervene to stop Defendant Chauvin’s use of unreasonable force” when Floyd was unresponsive on the ground. In nine minutes-plus of viral bystander video capturing Floyd’s final moments, Chauvin fatally knelt on Floyd’s neck while he was handcuffed and pinned on the street. Lane and Keung held the lower portion of Floyd’s prone body down while Thao kept back members of the public who were begging the officers to spare the man as he pleaded for mercy. The video, captured by teenager Darnella Frazier, who was on her way to a corner store where Floyd had been accused of trying to use a counterfeit bill, was instrumental in Chauvin’s conviction. It will undoubtedly be used as evidence against the three officers in the federal case. “The defense is going to have to ask [the jury] not to believe their eyes. That’s the problem with this case because the elements are shown,” Robert Bennett, a prominent civil rights lawyer in Minneapolis specializing in police brutality cases, said. The outcome of the federal trial may have a bearing on the three men’s state trial, scheduled for June. “If they’re convicted on federal crimes, it may obviate the need for the state trial, although they can go ahead with both. Or if they are convicted [in the civil rights case], it might engender a [guilty] plea in the state case,” Bennett added. Keung and Lane had been police officers for less than six months on 25 May 2020, Thao for more than eight years. As concerns were raised last week about the perceived white majority jury, larger questions surround the race of the three defendants. While Lane is white, Kueng is Black and Thao is of Asian descent. “The fact that two thirds of the officers are officers of color reflects the fact that diversity alone cannot solve the problem of police violence,” Michelle Phelps, associate professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota, said. Steve Floyd said he believes an officer’s race makes less of a difference when they all “become blue” and join what’s known as the blue wall of silence when law enforcement close ranks over the misconduct of their own. The initial anodyne police press release after George Floyd was killed was headlined “Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction”. But once Frazier’s mobile phone video surfaced, it became the heart of what Floyd’s family last spring called a “slam dunk” case against Chauvin, and a series of officers, from then-police chief Medaria Arradondo on down the ranks, testified against the ex-cop in a noticeable, rare turn of events in favor of a Black victims of police violence. But while some may think that the criminal and civil rights trials of these four former officers is a first step in holding police officers accountable, others are less optimistic. “If you were to show the video – that I’ve never seen – of George Floyd being choked out for over nine minutes to a Black person living in the US under slavery, they would probably take a wild gamble that nothing has changed,” Toussaint Morrison, a Minneapolis activist, said. “So locking those boys up doesn’t mean justice to me.” Unlike Chauvin’s murder trial, which was streamed and viewed across the globe, cameras are not allowed in federal courtrooms. But that doesn’t undermine the significance of Thao, Kueng and Lane’s civil rights trial. And while voters ultimately rejected proposals to replace the Minneapolis police department with a public safety unit after Floyd was killed, demands for equity and law enforcement reform persist. “You can’t un-know or unsee the extremes of public violence and modern day attempts to lynch people of color in Minnesota – and that goes for Black and Native folks and folks of color,” Morrison said.",News/US news,‘Slow journey to justice’: trial of three ex-police officers involved in George Floyd murder begins,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/trial-george-floyd-murder-minneapolis-three-ex-police-officers
1/24/2022,"The Covid pandemic has entered a perplexing phase, challenging our beliefs about what the best responses are and how we should behave. Is Omicron now “just like the flu”, meaning we can relax – or does that overlook the continuing crisis in hospitals, the record hospitalisation rates for children, the continuing deadly danger for elderly and clinically vulnerable people, and the lengthening shadow of long Covid? Is it time, as the government has decided in England, to throw away our masks and perhaps to abandon self-isolation rules, or is that recklessly optimistic (if not just politically expedient for the prime minister)? Our pandemic narratives are splintering. Once, aside from a handful of noisy libertarians who insisted that lockdowns and mask mandates were violations of civil liberty, most people accepted that restrictions were necessary to prevent the health system from imploding and to reduce the risks for vulnerable people. Now, even some experts who previously advised caution and criticised lax and tardy government strategy, such as the public health expert Devi Sridhar of Edinburgh University, have suggested that the virus has been largely “defanged” and that it’s time to “move forward” with our lives. Others react to such suggestions with horror, pointing out that this isn’t an option open to all. There’s much talk of the virus having become “endemic” – a nonsensical suggestion if you know what the word actually means, but one that reflects an increasing sense that, one way or another, we will have to learn to live with the virus, as the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said this week.  All of this shows how unwise it is to try to tell a simple story about where we are. As Mark Honigsbaum concluded from his magisterial historical survey The Pandemic Century, the way pandemics end is “never quick and never neat”. Yet, he argued, we yearn for “narrative closure”: hence the allure of “herd immunity”, floated even by the government’s chief scientific advisers as the promised land in the early days of the pandemic and subsequently advocated with misplaced confidence by the Great Barrington declaration. The fantastical nature of such narratives is now coming home to roost. That deluded dream of closure is encouraged, too, by the military narrative the government has adopted. From the outset, as the sociologist Franziska Kohlt of the University of York has written, “government and its representatives ‘declared war on coronavirus’, framed themselves as a ‘wartime government’, and described their response as a ‘battle plan’”. Boris Johnson evidently fancied himself as the pandemic’s Churchill, although his promise in July 2020 that it would all be over by Christmas recalled instead the misguided belief voiced in 1914 about the first world war. Blind to warnings of the harm that warfare metaphors can wreak in medicine – “war on AIDs”, “battle against cancer” – politicians have clung to them; even last week Javid insisted that the Omicron variant is “in retreat”. All this jingoistic battlespeak, Kohlt says, is not only distinctively British – the pandemic narrative in Germany was framed more in terms of building dams, for instance – but dovetails perfectly with the exceptionalist ideology of Brexit. Among other things, it enabled the deaths of health workers on the “frontline” to be framed as a noble sacrifice by “heroes” in the line of duty, rather than the avoidable cost of negligence and neglect. The wartime rhetoric reached surreal proportions with the government advice to “stay alert”, as though we should be on the lookout for sneaky viruses lurking in the shadows. This war narrative also encouraged the idea that there would eventually be a victory: an armistice day when the foe was vanquished. Hence the full relaxation of restrictions on 19 July last year being dubbed Freedom Day (and how did that turn out?). Now that we are forced to accept that – as experts always knew – there will never be a triumphant declaration of “herd immunity”, much less of “surrender” from a virus perfectly capable, as far as we know, of still generating variants worse than Omicron, we are left casting around for new ways to tell the story. The favourite candidate seems to be “living with the virus”. It’s equally flawed. For Javid and others who believe “personal choice” should be society’s guiding principle, the phrase carries an implication that it’s time to get real, man up and stop hiding behind masks. “Sadly people die of flu as well,” Javid said. “In a bad flu year you can sadly lose about 20,000 lives, but we don’t shut down our entire country.” Indeed not, but this doesn’t mean we eschew other preventive measures and simply take it on the chin. Perhaps instead we might accept that routine mask-wearing to reduce any airborne infection is not just a weird thing people do in Asian countries, and that maybe mild, minimally inconveniencing measures like better ventilation and some degree of social distancing at the height of the flu season might reduce that death toll too. The idea we should just be getting on with our lives plays along with the narrative that, if victory isn’t an option, we need to be more stoical. That’s all very well if you’re not on chemotherapy, or compelled to cram on to trains every morning, and won’t lose income when you’re off work with the virus. Yet by the same token, lockdowns and other restrictions also hit disadvantaged people hardest. In short, there are no perfect solutions or tidy endings while inequality persists; pandemics are political, and we’re evidently not all in this one together. We need to reject simplistic stories about where we are with Covid. None can be universal and none captures the whole picture: they may conceal and mislead more than they illuminate. We’ve been living with the virus for two years, and we’ll keep doing so as best we can. But spare us the slogans. Philip Ball is a science writer.

1/24/2022,"Nato is reinforcing its eastern borders with forces on land, sea and air, the military alliance’s secretary general has said, as a Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared increasingly likely. Jens Stoltenberg said the “deteriorating security situation” had led Nato allies to ready frigates, fighter jets and troops for their “collective defence”.  The US administration was also ready to increase its military presence in eastern Europe, Nato’s chief, a former prime minister of Norway, warned in a statement that appeared designed to further raise the stakes for the Kremlin. “I welcome allies contributing additional forces to Nato,” Stoltenberg said. “Nato will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the alliance. We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, condemned the Nato deployments, saying that the military alliance was “demonising Russia” in order to “justify military activity on [Nato’s] eastern flank.” “The language of Nato is the language of threats and military pressure,” he said in remarks published by Russian media. “This is nothing new.” The development came as the White House and Downing Street said they had started withdrawing diplomats’ families from Ukraine, and EU foreign ministers gathered to discuss the escalating crisis with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Blinken is to brief the ministers by video link on his talks last week with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. More than 100,000 Russian troops and heavy weapons have been mobilised on the Ukrainian border. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc would consider removing its staff after the talks with Blinken but that he was not yet aware of an urgent need. The new Nato military capability announced for the east includes Denmark’s deployment of a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 fighter jets to Lithuania. Spain has said it is sending ships to join Nato naval forces and is considering sending fighter jets to Bulgaria. Emmanuel Macron has expressed his government’s readiness to send French troops to Romania under Nato command. Nato increased its presence within the territory of its eastern member states in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. There are currently four multinational battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, led by the UK, Canada, Germany and the US. At their meeting in Brussels, EU ministers are expected to reiterate their warning of a severe economic price to be paid by Russia should it invade Ukraine, after a wobble in Berlin. Germany’s navy chief, Kay-Achim Schönbach, resigned his position after it emerged that he has said that Vladimir Putin deserved respect. Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister, said the new German government was in a “difficult situation” having started just “a month ago”. But he warned that the EU and the US needed to show a unified front. “We are convinced that real war is a likely possibility,” he said. “The sanctions have to be unbearable.” Arriving in Brussels, Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said he would inform his counterparts that Russia planned to hold war games 240km (150 miles) off Ireland’s coast, within international waters and the country’s exclusive economic zone. He said: “We don’t have a power to prevent this happening but certainly I’ve made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that it’s not welcome. “This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine. The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks”. Russia continued preparations for sweeping naval exercises on Monday as the Baltic Fleet announced that two corvettes had set sail to join in the military drills. The Kremlin has also dispatched six amphibious landing ships to the Mediterranean Sea as part of the exercises, which will include 140 ships and more than 10,000 Russian troops. Russia is also set to hold joint military drills in Belarus in February. The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Monday he would deploy a “whole contingent of the army” to the border with Ukraine, alleging that “Ukrainians have begun to gather troops [there].

1/24/2022,"Britain could grow up to eight times its current production of fruit and vegetables if all available urban and under-used green space were turned to cultivation, new research has shown. Only about 1% of urban green space is made up of allotments, but if gardens were used, along with parks, playing fields, watersides and other overlooked open spaces, the area would add up to enough to grow nearly 40% of the UK’s fresh fruit and vegetable consumption, most of which comes from overseas, according to the study.  While researchers were not seriously suggesting ploughing up parks and recreation areas, the first nationwide study of urban growing potential, by Lancaster University, demonstrated how much potential lies in areas that are currently often undervalued and overlooked. Using just a fraction of the nation’s scraps of urban green land for communal growing could provide a useful amount of fresh fruit and vegetables that would improve people’s diets, help vulnerable people and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Jess Davies, professor of sustainability at Lancaster University and principal investigator of the study, said the UK had the potential for an urban agricultural revolution, by looking at ways to bring even a small amount of the available land into food production. “The UK is really bad for not eating enough fresh fruit and vegetables, and this could make a real difference,” she said. “Even if you just put a small amount of it to use, you can boost fresh fruit and vegetable availability by a meaningful amount.” This could have numerous benefits for people’s physical and mental health, from better nutrition but also from the exercise and time spent outdoors, and the satisfaction of producing healthy things to eat. Davies foresees other benefits too, from giving people on low incomes access to cheap fresh food to learning new skills, and providing improved habitat for wildlife and pollinators. At a time when allotment waiting lists around the country are vastly oversubscribed, looking afresh at neglected sites could bring new possibilities, according to Davies. “This could be about communal activity – growing clubs, local societies, communal plots,” said Davies. “People engaged in growing have better diets, and healthier behaviours. Food growing is recreational, it counters loneliness and creates social cohesion.” More than a third of the UK’s food in total, and much more in the case of fresh fruit and vegetables, comes from overseas, and as the pandemic and Brexit have shown, the import of food can be vulnerable to shocks. But British farmland is already under pressure, from intensive agriculture, urbanisation and the need for new homes, and biodiversity on farmland has fallen sharply, prompting calls for rewilding and less intensive farming practices. “You don’t want to convert more land to agriculture, as that drives biodiversity loss and climate change,” said Davies. “But we have shown that you don’t need to: there is a lot of urban resource out there that is overlooked. We hope this research will spark conversations about the potential.” Other studies have shown the potential for urban food production at a local level: a recent two-year pilot in Brighton, for instance, showed that urban plots can be as productive as conventional farms. The new study from Lancaster is the first to take a nationwide view and establish the upper limit for how much urban green space in the UK could theoretically produce if turned to fruit and vegetable cultivation. Davies said problems on some brownfield sites, of soil contamination or pollution, could be overcome by using raised beds and growing screens of trees or hedges to trap airborne pollution. The researchers used Ordnance Survey master maps to identify urban green spaces, and estimated how much food they could produce using comparisons with UK agriculture. The paper, co-authored by scientists from Teagasc Ashtown Food Research Centre in Ireland, the University of Liverpool and Cranfield University, is published in the peer-review journal Environmental Research Letters.",Lifestyle/Food,UK could grow up to 40% of its own fruit and vegetables by using urban green spaces,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/24/uk-could-grow-up-fruit-and-vegetables-urban-green-spaces
1/24/2022,"Polish senators plan to draft a law that would regulate the use of surveillance technology in the country, after hearing testimony of how the invasive Pegasus spyware has been used against a number of government critics. Poland is the latest country where Pegasus, a surveillance tool developed by Israeli company NSO, appears to have been used for political purposes. Pegasus allows the operator to take control of a target’s mobile device, to access all data even from encrypted messaging apps, and to turn on audio or video recording.  Gabriela Morawska-Stanecka, deputy speaker of the senate and a member of a commission set up to investigate the allegations, described Pegasus as a “cyberweapon” and said the way it had allegedly been used in Poland was completely inappropriate. “It should only be used for the most serious crimes such as terrorism,” she said, in an interview in her senate office. “It shouldn’t be the case that you can’t feel safe in your own home, your own bathroom or your own bedroom.” The Polish Pegasus scandal was first reported last month by the Associated Press, after an investigation by the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which found Pegasus had been used against at least three people, including opposition senator Krzysztof Brejza. Forensic analysis of his device showed it had been compromised numerous times in 2019 while he was running the electoral campaign of the opposition Civil Platform party. Brejza told the commission last week that the dates of the attacks “coincided 100% with the election calendar” and stopped a few days after the vote. Law and Justice, the lead party in the current ruling coalition, has boycotted the commission in the opposition-led senate. Citizen Lab also confirmed that the devices of lawyer Roman Giertych and prosecutor Ewa Wrzosek had been targeted. Wrzosek is a member of Lex Super Omnia, an association of prosecutors fighting for the independence of the prosecutors office. “In my opinion, there was no legal or factual basis to authorise the surveillance of me with the Pegasus, and the secret service officers who did so committed a crime,” said Wrzosek. Wrzosek said she infuriated the government by attempting to launch an investigation into the circumstances of holding a presidential election during the early stages of the Covid pandemic in 2020. “The investigation was taken away from me and discontinued after three hours, and because of this I was facing harassment,” she said. In January last year, she was transferred to a prosecutor’s office several hours’ drive away from her home. Poland has been embroiled in a long-running battle with Brussels over changes which have undermined the independence of the judiciary. “Wrzosek is one of only a few independent prosecutors, and she had a media profile. Probably she simply became a personal enemy,” said Adam Bodnar, dean of the law faculty at SWPS University in Warsaw and Poland’s former human rights ombudsman. Poland’s Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, the CBA, bought Pegasus in 2017 using funds from the Ministry of Justice, according to documents presented to the hearing by the former head of the supreme audit office. The CBA, in a statement, declined to confirm whether the agency had acquired Pegasus, or whether it was used against Wrzosek and others. However, it said any use of surveillance would have “obtain[ed] the legally required consents, including the court’s consent”. An NSO spokesperson declined to say if the company had sold Pegasus to Poland, citing a company policy of not confirming or denying its clients. It claimed the company had “zero tolerance” for the use of its spyware against political targets. Jarosław Kaczyński, the chairman of Law and Justice, admitted in a recent interview with Sieci magazine that Poland had acquired the tool, but dismissed allegations that it had been used for political purposes as “nonsense”. Some have argued that all use of Pegasus is illegal according to current Polish law, but rights advocates say the real issue is broader, and fits into a pattern of Poland’s government trampling on democratic norms. “Judges have no tools to realistically check whether the services are abusing their powers, and there is no one who could verify it later,” said Wojciech Klicki of the Panoptykon Foundation, a Polish NGO focusing on technology and surveillance. Poland’s government is one of many now faced with calls to regulate the use of Pegasus and similar tools. Dozens of rights organisations have called on the European Union to impose sanctions on NSO Group. In November, the Biden administration announced it was putting the Israeli company on an export blacklist, saying its tools had been used for “transnational repression”. Last year, a group of media organisations, including the Guardian, reported on the use of Pegasus against journalists, activists and politicians in numerous countries across the world. Forensic analysis of telephones showed that in Hungary, journalists, activists and lawyers had been targeted with Pegasus. In Poland, Klicki said he hoped the senate commission would draft “a comprehensive reform of control over secret services”. There is little chance of such a law passing through the government-led lower chamber of parliament, but the opposition-controlled senate could draft a law that would allow a future government to adopt it. Morawska-Stanecka said the commission planned to work on this new draft law, and would also hear from legal experts about whether the use of Pegasus against Brejza, while he was running the opposition campaign, meant the 2019 election result could be deemed to have influenced the fairness of the vote. “We knew the 2019 elections weren’t a fair fight, because of the abuse of public media in favour of the ruling party, but we couldn’t have guessed that the secrecy of campaign work could be stolen using secret surveillance,” she said.",News/World news,Polish senators draft law to regulate spyware after anti-Pegasus testimony,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/polish-senators-draft-law-to-regulate-spyware-after-anti-pegasus-testimony

1/24/2022,"My brother-in-law Nicholas Donnelly, who has died aged 83, was an actor best known for the role of Mr MacKenzie in the BBC television series Grange Hill. From 1985 to 1993, he played the Scottish woodwork teacher in the fictional north London comprehensive, a popular character for a generation of children. His other roles included 16 years as Sgt Johnny Wills in the BBC television police series Dixon of Dock Green, from 1960 to 1976. This began as a walk-on part but he persuaded the director to let him develop the role.  Nick was a Londoner, born in Kensington to Irish parents. He enjoyed telling stories of how at the start of his career he waylaid directors for parts. If they had said casually they would see him, he held them to it. His contemporaries and friends included Tommy Steele and Lionel Bart, young men enjoying the jazz clubs. A lifelong supporter of Queens Park Rangers, Nick was amused one day, taking his sons to a match, when the fans started whistling the Dixon theme tune: An Ordinary Copper. He was also in The Saint, the 1960s television thriller series starring Roger Moore, and his film roles ranged from the horror thriller Venom (1981) to the comedy Carry on Sergeant (1958). Nick was the second of four children born to Margaret (nee Barry) and James Donnelly, who had left Waterford and Carlow respectively for west London, where they met. James had a window cleaning business in Bayswater, Maida Vale and Little Venice, and Margaret was catering manager at a girls’ prep school. The family was bombed out twice in the blitz. Nick aged two was dug out of the rubble. His mother steeled herself as she told a rescuer: “If he is dead, you can tell me.” When someone said a toddler had asked for “Kinkie”, Nick’s name for his sister Peggy, she knew he was alive. He went to what was then Cardinal Vaughan grammar school in Holland Park. Surprisingly for those of us who knew Nick as a gentle soul, he is still on the disciplinary ledger. He threw something in a lesson at a bully who had made fun of a pupil who did not know the answer to a question. Nick got the cane. But later the headmaster gave him an apple because he had immediately owned up to the crime. While stationed in Germany for national service in the late 1950s, Nick met his wife, Alrun Sauré, a Berliner. They married in 1959 and settled in Twickenham, where they had two sons and twin daughters. They were married for over 62 years. In 1993, he and Alrun retired to Hastings, where he became a special minister of his Catholic church, St Mary Star of the Sea. He was a member of the Knights of St Columba and the Catenians. Nick died suddenly. He had not been ill. He went to sleep on a Saturday night, and did not wake up. A happy man, he was a gracious host and great raconteur. Nick is survived by Alrun, his sons, James and Barry, his daughter Abigail, five grandchildren, his sister, Peggy, and brothers, John and Martin. His daughter Alexandra died in 2016.",Arts/Television & radio,Nicholas Donnelly obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/24/nicholas-donnelly-obituary
1/24/2022,"The actor Evan Rachel Wood has accused the rock musician Marilyn Manson of raping her on the set of the music video for his 2007 single Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand). In Phoenix Rising, a new documentary about her life and career which premiered at the 2022 Sundance film festival, Wood said that during a previously discussed “simulated sex scene”, Manson “started penetrating me for real” once the cameras were rolling.  “I had never agreed to that,” she said. She said she was fed absinthe on the set of the video, in which she plays a character styled as Lolita, and was barely conscious to object to Manson’s alleged actions. The Guardian has contacted representatives for Manson, born Brian Warner, for comment. Wood said that she had “never been on a set that unprofessional in my life up until this day. It was complete chaos and I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me.” She said she didn’t know how to advocate for herself or say no “because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back – to just soldier through” and claimed that the crew “was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do”. She said the alleged incident made her feel “disgusting and like I had done something shameful”. “I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretences. That’s when the first crime was committed against me and I was essentially raped on camera.” She said that Manson gave her “really clear” instructions on how she should describe the video to journalists. “I was supposed to tell people we had this great, romantic time and none of that was the truth,” she says. “But I was scared to do anything that would upset Brian in any way. The video was just the beginning of the violence that would keep escalating over the course of the relationship.” Manson, however, teased the media with the notion that there was truth to the video’s apparent “realism”. Wood previously accused Manson, with whom she was in a relationship from 2007 to 2010, of grooming her when she was a teenager and said he “horrifically abused me for years.I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.” Wood met Manson in 2006. She was 18, he was 38. She is among a number of women, including Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco, who have accused Manson of sexual and physical violence involving torture. Manson has denied the charges made against him, calling them “horrible distortions of reality … my intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual”. He is facing up to four lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, battery and harassment as well as an investigation into allegations of domestic violence incidents by the Los Angeles County sheriff’s department, which raided his home in November 2021. After Vanity Fair published an article detailing the first of these allegations in February 2021, Manson was dropped by his record label, Loma Vista. Manson has received support from the rapper Kanye West, who brought him out at a livestream event for his album Donda, on which Manson appears, and at one of his Sunday Service events. Manson shares in the Grammy nominations for Donda, which is up for album of the year and best rap song for Jail, on which Manson appears. Following controversy over his recognition, Recording Academy president and CEO Harvey Mason Jr said that personal and legal matters would not affect artists’ eligibility. Phoenix Rising, a film by Oscar-nominated director Amy Berg, will air on HBO in the US in March. It also follows the creation of the Phoenix Act, legislation led by Wood that extends the statute of limitations for survivors of domestic violence to pursue charges against their abusers, which was signed into law in October 2019.",Arts/Music,Evan Rachel Wood accuses Marilyn Manson of raping her on music video set,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/24/evan-rachel-wood-accuses-marilyn-manson-of-raping-her-on-music-video-set
1/24/2022,"The UK economy grew at its slowest pace in almost a year in January as hospitality, leisure and travel businesses felt the impact of the Omicron variant. The monthly flash PMI (purchasing managers’ index) estimate of activity from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply reported a two-speed recovery with an easing of supply-chain bottlenecks for manufacturing offset by weakness in consumer-facing service companies.  Service sector growth eased for a third month, according to the survey, amid reports from businesses of a loss of momentum caused by pandemic disruptions and very subdued demand. Amid widespread reports of severe cost pressures, the IHS Markit/Cips measure of output fell from 53.6 to 53.4 in January – its lowest level in 11 months. Any finding above 50 denotes that the economy is expanding rather than contracting. Chris Williamson, IHS Markit’s chief business economist, said: “A resilient rate of economic growth in the UK during January masks wide variations across different sectors. Consumer-facing businesses have been hit hard by Omicron and manufacturers have reported a further worrying weakening of order book growth, but other business sectors have remained encouragingly robust. “Looking ahead, while the Omicron wave meant the hospitality sector has sunk into a third steep downturn, these restrictions are now easing, meaning this downturn should be brief. Many business and financial services companies have meanwhile been far less affected by Omicron, and saw business growth accelerate at the start of the year.” The gloomy picture for consumer-facing parts of the service sector contrasted with a report from Lloyds Bank showing spending on debit cards in the first two weeks of 2022 up by 27% on the same period in 2020, before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. While less was spent on commuting and holidays, there were sharp increases in payments in restaurants and bars, shops and cinemas, the bank said. Flash PMI estimates for the eurozone showed activity in the service sector affected by Omicron, with growth slowing to its weakest in 11 months. Germany, France, Italy and Spain – the four biggest economies – have all tightened restrictions in recent weeks.",News/Business,UK business growth hits 11-month low as Omicron chills service sector,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/uk-business-growth-omicron-covid-variant-january
