1/19/2022,"A South Florida police sergeant has been taken off the street after a video of him choking a fellow officer emerged last week. Sgt. Christopher Pullease has been relieved of his supervisory duties with the Sunrise, Florida, police department and is now under investigation after local news station WSVN, acting on a tip, began asking about an incident in which Pullease grabbed a female officer by the throat. The incident occurred on Nov. 19 when officers were called to a convenience store on Sunset Strip after complaints about an individual committing aggravated battery. A man identified as Jean Bernard Similien, reportedly attacked several people outside the business sunrise police, Chief Anthony Rosa told Local 10 News. Cops were trying to place Similien inside the patrol car, but he resisted. Rosa told the news station that once Similien was inside but refusing to allow the doors to close, Pullease “approached and engaged in a verbal altercation with the suspect in a manner that I feel was inappropriate and unprofessional.” He noted, “This supervisor escalated the encounter instead of de-escalating an emotionally charged situation.” Audio in the body camera clip released by the Sunrise Police Department has been removed. However, Pullease can be seen leaning into the car in front of Similien while holding his can of pepper spray in front of Similien as if he’s about to use it. Soon afterward, a nearby officer whose face in the video is blurred and whose name has not been released, comes running toward Pullease and grabs him by his belt, pulling him away from the Similien. That’s when the sergeant is captured turning around and aggressively grabbing the officer by the neck while pushing her backward toward another police car. He then returns to the patrol car and slams the door before turning back to continue yelling and pointing at the female officer who stopped him. Rosa, who said last week Pullease is on desk duty pending an internal affairs investigation — but did not say whether Pullease was taken off the street immediately after the incident or only when news of the incident came to llight — described the sergeant’s behavior in the clip to WSVN last week as “disgusting” when asked about his initial reaction. “I think the video speaks for itself,” Rosa added. When asked why he wasn’t the officer arrested, citing that had a civilian done the same, they’d be arrested, Rosa said that at the moment he was unable to disclose more on the case but would keep the public updated. Rosa also noted that Sunrise officers are required to “de-escalate and intervene” if an officer appears to lose control or display inappropriate conduct. “This officer intervening and stopping a situation from getting any worse is a direct reflection of the training that we do do with the police department, and I think that it’s important to note that the behavior is very unacceptable by the sergeant, but the behavior of the officer that intervened is exactly what society’s asking their police officers to do right now,” he said. Elsewhere, Rosa commended the actions of the 28-year-old police officer. “I am very proud of the officer involved in this incident and believe that the actions taken were definitive and demonstrative of good leadership during a tense situation,” he shared. Pullease has been with the Florida police department for 21 years, while the subordinate personnel has been there for two.

1/19/2022,"By Tom Hals WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shareholders urged a judge on Tuesday to find Elon Musk coerced the company's board into a 2016 deal for SolarCity and asked that the chief executive be ordered to pay the electric vehicle company one of the largest judgments ever of $13 billion. ""This case has always been about whether the acquisition of SolarCity was a rescue from financial distress, a bailout, orchestrated by Elon Musk,"" said Randy Baron, an attorney for shareholders, at the start of his closing arguments. The closing arguments recounted key findings from a 10-day trial in July when Musk spent two days on the stand defending the deal. The lawsuit by union pension funds and asset managers alleges that Musk strong-armed the Tesla board into approving the deal for the cash-strapped SolarCity, in which Musk was the top shareholder. Musk has countered that the deal was part of a decade-old master plan to create a vertically integrated company that would transform energy generation and consumption with SolarCity's roof panels and Tesla's cars and batteries. Evan Chesler, one of the lawyers representing Musk, told the hearing that the deal was not a bailout and SolarCity was far from insolvent and its finances resembled many high-growth tech companies. ""They were building billions of dollars of long-term value,"" Chesler said of SolarCity. The all-stock deal was valued at $2.6 billion in 2016, but since that time Telsa's stock has soared. Shareholder attorney Lee Rudy urged Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware's Court of Chancery to order Musk return the Tesla stock he received, which would be worth around $13 billion at its current price. Musk said in court papers such an award would be at least five times the largest award ever in a comparable shareholder lawsuit and called it a ""windfall"" for plaintiffs. Rudy said Slights should consider Musk's contempt for the deposition and trial process, in which he repeatedly clashed with and insulted shareholder attorneys. ""It would be a windfall for Elon Musk if he got to keep shares he never should have gotten in the first place,"" Rudy said. Chesler called the request to order Musk to return the stock from the deal ""preposterous"" and said it ignored five years of unprecedented success at Tesla. Tesla's stock was flat at around $1,049. Telsa acquired SolarCity as the electric vehicle maker was approaching the launch of its Model 3, a mass-market sedan that was critical to its strategy. Shareholders allege the deal was a needless distraction and burdened Tesla with SolarCity's financial woes and debt. Shareholders claim that despite owning only 22% of Tesla, Musk was a controlling shareholder due to his ties to board members and domineering style. If plaintiffs can prove this, it increases the likelihood that the court will conclude the deal was unfair to shareholders. Musk has consistently told the court that the Tesla board primarily handled the SolarCity deal and that he recused himself from price negotiations. Musk repeatedly defended the SolarCity deal by saying the company had to be quickly acquired or find financing to solve its dangerous cash shortage. Slights said last week he intends to retire in the coming months and a related shareholder lawsuit challenging Musk's record pay package was transferred from Slights to another judge.

1/19/2022,"Sonia Sotomayor attended oral arguments remotely because Neil Gorsuch didn't wear a mask, NPR said. Chief Justice John Roberts asked the court to wear masks on Sotomayor's behalf, the report said. All of the justices are fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has diabetes and is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, has been participating in Supreme Court oral arguments remotely from her private chambers after Justice Neil Gorsuch refused to wear a mask, NPR's Nina Totenberg reported on Tuesday. Sotomayor hasn't taken the bench this year amid the nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant. The remaining justices have appeared in the courtroom for arguments, with each of them wearing masks, except for Gorsuch. After the onset of the pandemic, the nine justices first returned to in-person arguments last fall. At the time, none of the justices wore masks during oral arguments besides Sotomayor, NPR reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said either type of diabetes could make a person more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19. As infections began to spike recently, Chief Justice John Roberts ""in some form"" asked the entire court to wear masks on behalf of Sotomayor, NPR reported. All of them did, with the exception of Gorsuch. Based on the court's tradition, Sotomayor, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009, sits next to Gorsuch, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017. Sotomayor does not feel safe around unmasked individuals and has been participating remotely, per NPR. All nine justices are fully vaccinated and have received booster shots against COVID-19. ""[Gorsuch's] continued refusal since then has also meant that Sotomayor has not attended the justices' weekly conference in person, joining instead by telephone,"" NPR reported. A Supreme Court spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Gorsuch's behalf. Totenberg, a longtime Supreme Court reporter, also described an institution that's overflowing with animosity. The court's three liberals, including Sotomayor, are increasingly upset with their conservative colleagues, especially over the possibility that Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, could soon be overturned.  The justices recently split along ideological lines in a 6-3 decision blocking the Biden administration's mandate that would have required private companies with over 100 employees to get their workers vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested weekly. The court's conservative majority expressed skepticism of the Biden administration's power to impose a sweeping mandate on workplaces without direct authorization from Congress. The three liberals disagreed, writing in a dissenting opinion: ""When we are wise, we know enough to defer on matters like this one. When we are wise, we know not to displace the judgments of experts, acting within the sphere Congress marked out and under Presidential control, to deal with emergency conditions. Today, we are not wise."" In a separate 5-4 ruling, the court allowed a Biden administration mandate requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for healthcare workers at federally funded facilities to take effect. Two of the court's conservatives, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh, joined the liberals in the majority.

1/19/2022,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' swine inventory increased by about 700,000 heads over the last 12 months owing to a repopulation programme, following two years of declines due to African swine fever outbreaks, an agriculture official said on Tuesday. The inventory has risen to 9.8 million heads, from 9.1 million a year ago, said Reildrin Morales, director of the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Industry. The increase was ""substantial"", he said in a virtual briefing, citing official data, after the industry suffered a decline of more than 3 million heads between 2019 and 2020 mainly due to massive culling. The Philippines, the world's seventh-biggest pork importer before local demand was hammered by the pandemic, has been hit hard by such outbreaks and forced to ramp up pork imports to address an acute domestic shortage and temper food inflation. As of Jan. 13, 45 villages across the country still had active cases of African swine fever, a small fraction of the 3,582 villages hit by the disease since the first outbreak was reported in 2019, data from the department showed. Morales said the private sector has taken a lead role in the government-funded repopulation programme, and he expects the increased domestic supply to help stabilise pork prices eventually. ""By the third quarter of 2022, if the momentum and our repopulation and other initiatives continue, we can expect our pork supply to be on the positive side,"" he said.
