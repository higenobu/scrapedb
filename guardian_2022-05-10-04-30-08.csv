5/10/2022,"Rugby chiefs are poised to hold key discussions on Tuesday over the proposal to radically shake up the international calendar and introduce a new global competition to be staged every two years. Representatives from the Six Nations, Sanzaar (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) and World Rugby are poised to meet for crucial talks in Dublin over a biennial north v south competition, which would fully launch in 2026. It would be the sports’ biggest overhaul since the dawn of professionalism in 1995. The competition, which would not be played in World Cup or British & Irish Lions years, is a revamp of the Nations Championship which was proposed in 2019. While that was doomed to failure, a well-placed source said the latest format has been “broadly agreed by all parties”, including the players. In 2019 there was significant opposition from the players’ union amid welfare concerns, and while there are hurdles to be overcome, there is optimism progress will be made this week. The competition would involve the Six Nations – England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales – in the north while Australia, Argentina, Fiji, New Zealand and South Africa would be joined in the south by Japan, even though it is in the northern hemisphere. European teams would play three matches on their summer tours against three different opponents and face the remaining three southern nations at home in November. The top two in each pool would meet each other in a fourth week in November and it is understood there is some support for a finals day involving all teams, rather than a single fixture between the top two sides. Remaining stumbling blocks include the fact that there are only three official Test weeks in November at present – a finals day would require four and need agreements over player release with the French and English clubs. Insiders believe, however, that because of greater ongoing collaboration with the clubs there is likely to be less opposition from the Premiership and the Top 14 than three years ago. Other issues to be ironed are believed to be over revenue sharing, while it does not help that the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, will be absent from Dublin, after a recent pulmonary embolism, given his role in formulating the proposal to date. There are also concerns in some quarters over promotion and relegation from the competition with a second-tier tournament including nations such as the USA, Tonga, Samoa and Georgia also set to be introduced, possibly from 2024. It had initially been hoped that the top tier league would also launch in 2024 but, as previously revealed by the Guardian, that had come to been seen as overly optimistic. One of the major fears over the new tournament is that it would mean fewer matches between established and developing nations but it is believed that is not considered something that will torpedo the proposal. Equally significant is that both the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship would remain unaffected, removing the thorny issue of promotion and relegation being introduced to the former.",Sport/Sport,Rugby powers to hold talks on new global north v south tournament,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/rugby-powers-talks-new-global-north-v-south-tournament
5/10/2022,"People suffering from long Covid have reacted with alarm to comments by government’s equalities watchdog that the condition should not be treated as a disability. Under the Equalities Act, anyone with a physical or mental impairment that has lasted for longer than 12 months and has substantially impacted their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities, qualifies as disabled and is entitled to protection to ensure that they aren’t discriminated against in the workplace. This includes requesting that their employer makes “reasonable adjustments”, such as flexible working hours or home working, to ensure that they can continue working. In a tweet posted on Sunday night, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which was set up to promote and enforce equality and non-discrimination laws said: “Discussions continue on whether ‘long covid’ symptoms constitute a disability. Without case law or scientific consensus, EHRC does not recommend that ‘long covid’ be treated as a disability.” The statement prompted immediate concern and confusion from long Covid support groups and unions. Alice Arkwright, policy and campaigns support officer for the TUC, said: “We are concerned that this tweet may give license to employers to not provide those reasonable adjustments, when actually, there is a very clear definition of who is disabled under the Equalities Act.” Dr Jenny Ceolta-Smith, an employment advocate for Long Covid Support, and co-founder of Occupational Therapy for Long Covid, said: “There is already disbelief of workers’ long Covid symptoms within the workplace, and this harmful announcement by the EHRC may make it much harder for workers to gain the support that they need from colleagues and line managers. It may even mean more jobs are lost.” According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), an estimated 1.7 million people in the UK (2.7% of the population) were experiencing long Covid symptoms lasting longer than four weeks as of 5 March 2022. Of these, 784,000 said they’d been affected for longer than one year, and 74,000 had been experiencing symptoms for at least two years. Of those affected, 322,000 reported that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been “limited a lot”. Within this group, there will almost certainly be people who would qualify as disabled, however “it’s not like a lottery ticket; just because you say something could be considered as a disability, it doesn’t automatically get people blue badges and benefits,” said Lesley Macniven, an HR consultant and founder of Long Covid Work, which supports long Covid sufferers with workplace issues. “All it does is it puts a little bit more pressure on employers to make sure they try and help that person. People that we support want to get back to work, they want to stay in work, and be able to pay the bills and keep a roof over their head.” Catherine Hale, founder and director of Chronic Illness Inclusion, which advocates for people with chronic illness and energy-limiting conditions, said being able to access reasonable adjustments was critical to people staying in work. “They should be able to confidently go to their employer and have those conversations,” she said. A spokesperson for the EHRC said: “We would recommend that employers continue to follow existing guidance when considering reasonable adjustments for disabled people and access to flexible working, based on the circumstances of individual cases. “Given that long Covid is not among the conditions listed in the Equality Act as ones which are automatically a disability, such as cancer, HIV and multiple sclerosis, we cannot say that all cases of long Covid will fall under the definition of disability. “This does not affect whether ‘long Covid’ might amount to a disability for any particular individual. This will be determined by the employment tribunal or court considering any claim of disability discrimination.” However, Arkwright said asking someone who is suffering from Covid-associated fatigue to take their employer to a tribunal if they felt they’d been discriminated against, was unreasonable. “The TUC is asking for the government to automatically treat long Covid as a disability, so that people wouldn’t have to go through this process,” she said.",News/Society,Alarm after EHRC says long Covid should not be treated as disability,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/alarm-after-ehrc-says-long-covid-should-not-be-treated-as-disability
5/10/2022,"Authorities in Nevada have recovered another set of human remains from Lake Mead as a devastating drought has depleted the massive reservoir outside Las Vegas. Two sisters paddle boarding in the lake on Saturday spotted the bones, which they initially thought were the remains of a bighorn sheep. “For the longest time I was in disbelief, like I did not think that we actually found human remains,” Lynette Melvin told KLAS-TV. After spotting a jaw bone, they realized the remains were human and contacted park officials. National Park Service rangers collected them from Callville Bay, part of an area that is popular for boating and other water recreation. Las Vegas police said they are not investigating the case as a homicide. The Clark county coroner’s office is examining the remains as officials try to determine the identity. The discovery came a week after dwindling lake levels unearthed a barrel containing the body of a man who authorities said had been shot decades ago. Police estimate the man was probably killed between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s because he was wearing shoes made in that period. The Clark county coroner’s office is also trying to determine that person’s identity. Police said they planned to enlist experts at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to determine when the barrel started eroding. The grueling drought that has battered the American west hasdepleted the lakeone of the largest reservoirs in the US, so much that a water intake became visible two weeks ago. Las Vegas is now pumping water from deeper within the reservoir, which is part of a system that provides water to more than 40 million people and agriculture across the region. Officials have warned that the drought would likely bring more human remains to the lake’s surface. “I would say there is a very good chance as the water level drops that we are going to find additional human remains,” Ray Spencer, a lieutenant with the Las Vegas police, said after the discovery of the first set of remains.

5/10/2022,"For Boris Johnson, the safe place was a fridge. A space to chill out and hide away from unfriendly members of the media. Reporters who couldn’t be relied on to treat his every dishonesty with grotesque indulgence. Keir Starmer was rather bolder than that. He chose to give a mini press conference to the three main broadcasters, none of whom held back from asking the difficult questions. There again, the Labour leader probably had no choice. To have said nothing was to have played into No 10’s hands, making Starmer look defensive and shifty. Hell, it had even reached the point where some of Downing Street’s more servile hacks were writing stories about parties Keir had considered having and then reconsidered when the regulations changed. We’re now on to thought crimes. Hold the front page. Next we’ll be hearing about how Starmer once thought about going through an amber light before thinking better of it. Far better for him to go down fighting. It wasn’t ideal, mind. In hindsight, Starmer probably wishes he’d never had that beer or bought a curry for his staff. Let the bastards starve next time. But what’s done is done and he’d have to live with the consequences. So shortly after four in the afternoon, the Labour leader chose to launch his own counter-offensive to nearly two weeks of “Beergate” headlines orchestrated by No 10 and the rightwing tabloid press. Starmer began by reminding everyone of the sacrifices people had made during lockdown. The people they couldn’t see or even say goodbye to. He knew how that felt: he hadn’t been able to attend his mother-in-law’s funeral. The country had a right to expect their politicians to obey the same rules, so the idea that he had broken any rules was just absurd. What’s more, he didn’t believe that even Johnson really believed he, Starmer, had broken any rules. Almost certainly true, that. The Convict wouldn’t recognise any rule-breaking even if he was to walk in on No 10 staffers doing lines of coke in the toilets. One beer in Durham wouldn’t even begin to register on his conscience. If he had one. All that Boris really wanted was to drag everyone down to his level in the public’s mind. A morally relativistic race to the bottom. So that when he inevitably received further fixed-penalty notices for the Abba party in No 10 and the “bring your own booze” bash in the Downing Street garden that had gone on for hours and ended with the empties and the staffers getting mopped up from the flowerbeds, he could spin the narrative that all politicians were just the same. Beergate was no different to getting trashed at a karaoke night the day before the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral. But Starmer did want to draw a line between him and Johnson. If he was fined, he would resign. Promising to resign is never the best of looks – you don’t want to give people ideas – but Keir was calm and dignified throughout. This may not have been the presser he wanted to give, but he conducted it with integrity. Something that may not matter to some Tories or the Convict – anyone who thinks Starmer’s promise to walk in any way makes it more likely that Johnson will rethink his decision not to resign hasn’t been paying attention – but it does to Starmer. He’s old-fashioned that way. He won’t have to be dragged kicking and screaming away from his position as party leader. He won’t stoop to lies to brazen things out. If it turns out he’s made a mistake, he’ll take the rap. Unlike the Convict, who has never taken responsibility for anything. Not even his children. And maybe the less myopic would see in him the possibility of what a leader could look like. Not a pallid-faced narcissist with a toddler haircut whose only sincere belief is in his own exceptionalism. There were inevitably a few lacunae in Starmer’s narrative that the media were quick to pounce upon. Hadn’t he only promised to do what he was always going to have to do anyway if he was fined? Yup, but he’d done it with style and taken hold of the storyline. Already some Tory MPs who had previously called for his resignation were getting a bollocking from Conservative central office. They hadn’t been quite bright enough to see where this one logically concluded. Step forward the ever loyal, ever half-witted Micky Fab. But hadn’t Starmer also called for Johnson to resign when he had only been under police investigation? Much the same as he was now. Here the Labour leader wriggled uncomfortably. Because he was buggered if he was going to serve his own head up on a plate. That would be to play into the Convict’s hands. Months and months of Labour infighting while Johnson took the FPNs and inflation into double figures. So if it was all the same, he could live with a bit of hypocrisy. Just not the full-blooded corruption within No 10. So he was going to rewrite this one. He’d stay, if it was all the same. Not least because he had done nothing wrong. Unlike Johnson. Almost as an afterthought, Sky’s Beth Rigby shouted out a question to the retreating Starmer. To his credit, he turned to answer it. What would he do if the Durham constabulary said he’d committed a minor breach, as with Dominic Cummings’ eyesight test, but chose not to fine him? That wasn’t going to happen, he said. The penalty for a breach of the law was a fine. If he didn’t get a FPN, which he was sure he wouldn’t, then he was in the clear. Over to the Old Bill. No 10 and the tabloids may have been leaning on the Durham plods for the last fortnight. Now it was his turn. You’ve got to ask yourself one question: do I feel lucky? It seems that Starmer does. Or lucky enough. Politics is a messy, dirty business. Things get said that can’t be unsaid. The trick is to style them out. It turns out that honour and integrity aren’t black and white. They are a continuum. And Keir is on the side of the angels with dirty faces. Lord, make me pure. Just not quite yet.",News/Politics,Starmer draws a line as he launches Beergate counter-offensive | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/starmer-draws-a-line-as-he-launches-beergate-counter-offensive
5/10/2022,"Keir Starmer dramatically pledged to quit if he is fined for breaking lockdown rules, as Labour prepared to present police with a dossier of evidence to show his team worked beyond 1am on the night he was pictured drinking a beer. The Guardian can reveal Labour has compiled time-stamped logs of WhatsApp chats, documents and video edits – which it will provide to the investigation by Durham police. The party claims it proves the curry and beers shared between his team came as part of a long working day preparing for the Hartlepool byelection, meaning it was permitted under Covid rules at the time. In a speech on Monday after hours of agonising with his aides, Starmer took the gamble of his career by saying he would resign if police issued him with a fixed-penalty notice for what happened on April 30 last year. His deputy, Angela Rayner, who was also at Durham Miners Hall, also said she would resign if penalised. Starmer said he was determined to prove he had “different principles to the prime minister”, who has already been given a fixed-penalty notice for breaching lockdown rules in Downing Street. He said he was confident he had not broken the rules but would resign if fined, saying: “The British public deserve politicians who think the rules apply to them.” Detectives investigating the circumstances of the takeaway curry are considering interviewing the Labour leader face-to-face, the Guardian understands. Durham’s police’s investigation is set to extend into at least June and any of the at least 15 people present could face a penalty if deemed to have broken laws by detectives. Starmer is said to be confident he will not be fined because of the evidence that the takeaway was part of his working day, though a leaked memo showed the order was pre-planned at the end of a Zoom quiz organised by the local MP. In messages seen by the Guardian, at least two senior aides who were present at Durham Miners Hall sent queries about script edits and video editing between 10.30pm and 1am after the takeaway was ordered for the campaign team, which included Starmer, Rayner and the Labour MP Mary Foy. Labour sources said they would insist Starmer had not broken the rules regardless of whether work continued after the meal – but said the evidence added weight to Starmer’s case and gave them the confidence he would not have to resign. A party source said: “We have been totally clear that no rules were broken. We will provide documentary evidence that people were working before and after stopping to have food.” Starmer and his team will provide police with evidence from WhatsApp groups, including one set up for the visit, where tweets, scripts and video edits were being discussed until the early hours. In a speech on Monday, Starmer said he had “simply had something to eat whilst working late in the evening, as any politician would do days before an election.” Not all participants in the WhatsApp group were at the hall – and Starmer is not a member of either group – but one message the following day says “Keir woke up this morning with some queries about the video”. A source said Starmer was given overnight briefing papers to work through for the following day’s visit. The Labour leader filmed a video in the hall with timestamps on the video showing filming took place until 9.07pm – and WhatsApp messages then show aides corresponding about the edits. In a message at 10.52pm, an aide says they are “only just editing” a message for International Workers’ Day and warns they “won’t have something through for an hour or two”. They also say a script for Starmer’s visit to Liberty Steel in Hartlepool still needs to be completed. Labour will also show police edits made to a Google document containing a script for a clip Starmer would film at Liberty Steel, which show changes being made from 10.41pm until 11.19pm. One WhatsApp message with the final edit – from an aide who was with Starmer – sends the final edit at 1.56am with the message “sorry it’s so late”. The messages do not make it clear whether aides remained in the venue until that time or if they returned to work at their hotel. Starmer’s decision to announce he would resign if the police found he had broken the rules was criticised by some Conservative MPs as putting unnecessary pressure on Durham police. The minister Chris Philp suggested Stamer could be “attempting to pressure the police into clearing him”, describing the move as “deeply inappropriate”. Tory MPs had previously been warned by whips to stop short of calling for Starmer’s resignation because of the pressure it could put on Johnson. Starmer said it had been entirely his decision, amid rumours from Labour MPs that he had faced calls to make the declaration from members of his shadow cabinet. “This is my decision about what is the right thing to do in these circumstances,” he said. “This is about me. It’s about what I believe in in politics. It’s about integrity, and I believe in integrity, and integrity requires me to take the course of action I have set out if, in the event, I get a fixed-penalty notice.” Earlier on Monday Starmer pulled out of a speech at the Institute for Government as he wrestled with how to respond to the renewed pressure on him over the conduct at the gathering in Durham of Labour aides, some of whom were reported to have been drunk – which was denied by Foy. Starmer has a loophole where he could potentially be criticised by the police but not fined – an approach the Durham force took after an inquiry into alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings, who was then the prime minister’s senior aide. Answering questions from the media, Starmer indicated he would not necessarily step down if police did not fine him yet said the event could have breached rules. “The penalty for a Covid breach is a fixed-penalty notice,” he said when asked about that situation. “That’s a matter of law. And I’ve set out what the position is in relation to that.”",News/Politics,Labour says it can prove Starmer’s team worked past 1am on Beergate night,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/labour-says-can-prove-starmer-team-worked-past-1am-beergate-night
5/10/2022,"Female performers in British variety acts have long been termed “showgirls”. For the illusionist Marisa Carnesky, this demeans them. “What happens when the showgirl grows up?” she asks. A performance artist and creator of the interactive show Ghost Train – which was in residence at Blackpool for five years – Carnesky is using first-hand testimony, archival research and a healthy dose of guesswork to conjure the world of late 19th and early 20th-century female circus performers. The lives explored in her new production, Showwomen, include those of a sword climber, a clown, an aerialist and a daredevil. “The British seaside was always this extraordinary melting pot,” Carnesky says with glee. “Women weren’t just mute leg-kickers in a lineup.” First: the women who work with swords. Making the show with Carnesky is sword swallower Livia Kojo Alour, who was naturally drawn to the story of the sword artist, crocodile charmer and glass-walker Koringa. Working in the 1930s, Koringa was rumoured to hypnotise farm animals on enemy lines so soldiers could cross unnoticed. “There’s this picture where Koringa climbs up a high ladder of swords,” Kojo Alour says. “I do the same. I have a ladder of swords. I swallow swords; I lay on beds of nails.” She moves her hands as she speaks, occasionally flashing an intricate tattoo of a sword from elbow to wrist. In pictures, Koringa has dark skin, but it is uncertain whether she was an Indian performer, as touted by the Bertram Mills Circus posters, or whether she was encouraged to lean on a racist British fascination for the “exotic”. This is a term Kojo Alour has had to deal with often. “When I was starting out, I had a hard time. I was one of the very few Black performers on the London scene. I was constantly searching for something that made me stand out, and not in an exotic way, which is how I was described a lot back in the day.” She was drawn to extremities in performance. “The only way to carve my way was to do something dangerous that nobody else could do.” Another of the show’s main characters is the pioneering 1930s clown Lulu Adams. Her act would have felt something akin to drag kinging, Carnesky suggests, as clowning was only done by men. Carnesky and Kojo Alour will also be performing with the self-taught hair hanger Fancy Chance, who will explore the 1880s aerialist Miss La La, whom Degas painted hanging from her teeth. In some shows, they will be joined by the fire artist Lucifire, who will look into the life of the 1920s stuntwoman and Wall of Death rider Marjorie Dare. Throughout her research, Carnesky has been supported by Prof Vanessa Toulmin, director of the National Fairground and Circus Archive, whom Carnesky refers to reverentially. But even with this expert knowledge, so much detail of these performers’ lives remains unknown. “Did they know each other?” Carnesky wonders of Lulu Adams and Koringa, who at one point worked in the same circus. “Were they friends? When something went wrong, did they stay with each other?” In order to piece together a better idea of what the pioneering performers’ lives might have looked like, she has been speaking to some of their contemporaries. “I want to create a tapestry of retired performers,” she explains, “to bring these women back to life.” The next two interviews she has lined up are with a 93-year-old foot juggler and a member of a historic family of Romany clairvoyants. She has also been uncovering glimpses of the past through the Posh Club, a social club for “swanky senior citizens” run by the performance art collective Duckie. Just before the pandemic, Carnesky gave a lecture about her collated circus troupe, and was greeted at the end by a dapperly dressed gentleman in his 90s. He wore a pentagram, a sign of the occult. “I knew her,” the man said, “Koringa. I was a stuntman and she was quite a girl.” He asked Carnesky to come back for lunch, but almost immediately the pandemic hit. “By the time lockdown was over,” she says, “he had died.” She found his obituary: Count Harvey, circus showman, escapologist and wiccan high priest. Whatever he knew of Koringa, it will remain unshared. The elusiveness is part of what makes all this so exciting. Kojo Alour draws on this as she describes the thrill of the life-threatening performances that she and Koringa have made their living from, nearly a hundred years apart. “Learning these skills is a secret,” she says. “It’s almost impossible to find a teacher for sword-swallowing, so these secrets remain in the sideshow.” Throughout history, rare skills like these have been overlooked, a fact Carnesky is attempting to counter with a new undergraduate degree in contemporary and popular performance, which champions acts that have emerged from circus and the sideshow. Through Showwomen and the new BA, she wants to elevate these sidelined forms of mass entertainment, “to take away the snobbery and the hierarchy from spectacle”, she says. These skills, and the women who have performed them, deserve their time centre stage. Showwomen is on tour from 17 May to 18 June.",Arts/Stage,‘It’s hard to find a teacher for sword-swallowing’: the thrilling skills of circus showwomen,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/09/its-hard-to-find-a-teacher-for-sword-swallowing-the-thrilling-skills-of-circus-showwomen
5/10/2022,"If you polled the audience at New York’s Ambassador Theater on Saturday night, there’s a good chance many were there to see one person: Pamela Anderson, the 90s icon who’s been having a moment this spring. The Playboy cover model turned Baywatch babe turned tabloid fodder made not only her Broadway but her stage debut last month as Roxie Hart, the canny murderess in Bob Fosse’s burlesque romp Chicago, for an eight-week run in the show’s 25-year strong revival. The stunt casting served as somewhat of a tacit rejoinder to renewed attention on Anderson’s marriage to Motley Crue dummer Tommy Lee, and the sex tape marketed without their permission, brought on by the Hulu show Pam & Tommy. The eight-part limited series, released in March, stars Lily James as Anderson (wearing prosthetic breasts) and Sebastian Stan as Lee and reimagines the theft of their sex tape as gonzo pop culture history, complete with an animatronic penis and an in-vogue feminist revision of Anderson’s public shaming. Anderson did not participate in the series, nor did she lend her support to its portrayal of what by all accounts was a traumatic violation of her privacy. There’s been much press about the show’s queasy (in my view) lack of consent and our collective interest in redeeming shamed women; sources have expressed her discontent, but Anderson has said nothing. Instead, she has returned to the spotlight for work, bending the redemption narrative arc her way. (Ticket sales jumped 9% during her first week.) Chicago has a long history of stunt casting, and for good reason. The role of Roxie Hart – a woman who shoots her lover and tries to leverage her status as a celebrity criminal – can accommodate such Broadway interlopers as Ashlee Simpson, Brooke Shields and the Real Housewives’ Erika Jayne because it is fundamentally about misunderstood striving. Outside celebrity context only adds to the bit. Thus much of Anderson’s greenness – she’s open about learning to sing and dance for the job – can be folded into the role of Roxie, a fame-hungry nobody who dreams of vaudeville stardom. Anderson may not demonstrate great talent for singing (her voice is feathery and soft, at times difficult to hear even in the orchestra) or dancing (good enough), but she has what she needs: an unserious self-awareness and an excellent grasp on winking camp. With her glittery side pout and exaggerated smirks – her face took on the most hyperbolic vaudeville mugs like wax puddy, and I mean that in a good way – Anderson appeared to be both playing the floozy and poking fun at her own image at the same time. Lines such as “I’m older than I ever intended to be” drew laughs, while “I can still have my own act” elicited cheers. The enormous wink she gave while singing “What if the world slandered my name?” could probably be seen from Times Square. (The audience, myself included, laughed.) It helps that Broadway veteran Lana Gordon carries the burden of the show’s singing as star turned murderer Velma Kelly (and also appeared to enjoy sharing the spotlight with Anderson.) Freed up by an excellent cast in a revival that runs like a well-oiled machine, Anderson can afford to simply try her best. She may be new to Broadway but she’s working in familiar territory here – fluttering eyelids, ruby reds lips, a bustier that accentuates the contrast between her most famous assets and her tiny waist. Her Roxie Hart is a temptress, but one that’s putting on the show with a knowing eye toward the challenges of reputation and scandal, the balance of exploiting oneself and potential opportunities. “The story and my life are so parallel,” she told Vogue in March, while in rehearsals. “I always say … 30 years of therapy or just one Broadway show, then I’ll be fine.” Since Pam & Tommy’s release, Anderson has promised to tell “the real story” of her life in a forthcoming memoir and authorized Netflix documentary. Until then, perhaps the best way to subvert what Vulture critic Kathryn VanArendonk called “the limits of the women’s redemption plot” is not to make a point about it, but to simply have a good time. In Chicago, Anderson seems to be doing that before an audience rooting for her – and thus we had fun, too.",Arts/Stage,Razzle dazzle: Pamela Anderson takes back the narrative in Chicago,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/09/pamela-anderson-chicago-broadway-roxie-hart
5/10/2022,"Listen carefully and you may hear one of 60 pubs across the UK and Ireland playing anthems by the Beautiful South on Monday night. The venues have been selected by northern music legend Paul Heaton in honour of his 60th birthday, and by way of celebration he has put £1,000 behind the bar at each one. The former Housemartins and Beautiful South frontman used his Facebook page to invite fans to celebrate with him, explaining that his original tour plan involving cycling between venues around the UK had to be shelved after the pandemic caused delays to the recording of his new album. “The next best way to celebrate this coming of age is to hand-pick 60 pubs across the UK and Ireland and put a given amount of money behind the bar of each one,” he said. To celebrate my 60th birthday (on Monday 9th May) I’d originally intended to do another bicycle tour, visiting & performing at 60 pubs across the UK & Ireland. However, due to recording delays caused by the pandemic, I’ve had to shelve these plans for the time being… pic.twitter.com/lB3cJjf06m “The hope is to bring people together on the day, while recognising that many folk who bought my records or showed me support over the years could do with a wee party.” Heaton, who still performs today, shot to fame in the early 1980s with the Hull-based group the Housemartins. They produced two albums and several hit singles including Happy Hour and a cover version of Caravan of Love, which reached No 1 in the UK charts in December 1986. After the band split, he formed the Beautiful South in 1988, releasing 10 studio albums over 17 years. The Briton’s Protection, a central Manchester pub dating from 1750, is one of Heaton’s regular drinking spots. Two hours after opening at lunchtime, the bar manager John Burke couldn’t pull pints fast enough for the fans pouring in, eager to raise a glass to their favourite singer-songwriter. “He loves it here,” Burke said. “He always sits in the same spot when he comes and chats to people.” Grace Leape and Holly Roberts came to grab a drink in the sun after seeing Heaton’s birthday announcement. “We’re big fans, despite not having been old enough to remember lots of his biggest hits being released!” said Leape. “But I’ve been to a few of his gigs with my mum and I love the music.” Angela Lewis, a fellow fan, was wearing a Beautiful South T-shirt and hat as she sat enjoying a glass of wine. “I’ve been to one of his gigs almost every year since 1984,” she said. At the Orion pub in Withington, Phil and Cathy Gordon were reminiscing about the 1986 Housemartins gig they attended in the city. “He’s always seemed like someone who, in addition to being mega-talented, is also a really lovely man. He hasn’t let the fame go to his head,” Phil said. Just down the road at the Albert, the barmaid, Janine Renee, said she had seen quite a few new faces at the bar. “We’ll have to track him down and buy him a drink in return!” said Paul Conaghan as he and his partner Yvonne Clarke enjoyed a “birthday bevvy”. Hundreds of Heaton’s Twitter followers posted pictures of themselves in the pubs. John Richmond tweeted: “Fab idea. I’m sure it’ll make loads of people happy in difficult time,” with another adding: “Your music has brought me happiness and made me think for 30 years.” João Souser, originally from Faro in Portugal, shared fond memories of his brother learning to play Housemartins tunes on the piano when they were growing up. “We had the cassette!” he said. “I still remember the cover.” “The northern English music from that time is so nostalgic for me, and it’s part of the reason I moved to Manchester.” Then, as more people arrived for what looked likely to be the busiest Monday night the pub has seen for a while, Souser surveyed the room and added: “This is a city where music really brings people together, and you can see the proof of that here today.”",Arts/Music,"Grand gesture: musician Paul Heaton puts £1,000 behind bar at 60 pubs",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/09/grand-gesture-musician-paul-heaton-puts-1000-behind-bar-at-60-pubs
5/10/2022,"Keir Starmer has rarely before caused a moment of intense drama in national politics. But his televised statement that he would quit if Durham police issue him with a fine for breaching Covid rules was a highly compelling moment, and an unexpected gamble for someone that colleagues sometimes refer to as “cautious Keir”. It will have serious consequences, whatever the outcome of the investigation. If he is cleared by the police inquiry, he has drawn a moral line in the sand – one which Boris Johnson is on the wrong side of . Contrasting his own conduct with that of the prime minister, Starmer is attempting to pitch himself as a politician that the public can rely on to tell the truth and abide by society’s rules. If he is found by Durham police to have broken the rules, then he is showing that the Labour party believes politicians must take accountability. Once again, the difference will be clear compared with Johnson, who has refused to resign in the face of a police Covid fine. Johnson is still facing the prospect of potentially more fines from the police. And if the prime minister was to continue to refuse to stand down despite more penalties, when Starmer had already done so for more minor breaches of rules that he did not make, then the prime minister’s position would look increasingly untenable. The clear calculation behind Starmer’s statement is that this high stakes move makes him look bold and will win him praise for being decisive – two qualities he is not best known for. Some supporters of the move also believe it would have been impossible for him to do anything else when Labour MPs were being asked daily questions about his position, distracting from their focus on the prime minister’s misbehaviour. However, there is a counterargument. Some Labour insiders were incredulous that he would even talk of resigning before it became necessary, worrying that it would cause people to start writing him off too early. There are also concerns that it leaves Starmer in a difficult position if Durham police fudge their findings, as they did with former No 10 aide Dominic Cummings. If they issue a statement saying he may have broken the rules, but it is too historic to issue a fine, then Starmer will come under huge pressure to abide by the spirit of his statement. In the event that Starmer’s gamble backfires, ending in his resignation, it is not clear cut who else benefits. Starmer’s strongest supporters will be devastated to see the departure of someone they believe was rebuilding Labour’s support after a catastrophic 2019 election result and dealing with the antisemitism problem that had dogged the party. But there will be others in Labour who are pleased – both those wishing for a more charismatic leader, perhaps Wes Streeting or Lisa Nandy – or those who resent his decision to move Labour’s policies away from the Corbyn era. Equally, several Tory MPs said on Tuesday that they felt No 10 and Conservative party headquarters should be careful what they wished for. They would claim a scalp if Starmer were to go, but some Conservatives said they are fearful he could be replaced by someone punchier, with even further distance from Corbyn’s tenure. The move would also only serve to pile pressure on Johnson to take a similar course, though he is far from susceptible to feeling the need to emulate others doing the right thing. Starmer’s team clearly believe this is a very unlikely outcome, and are presenting evidence to Durham police that they say will prove he and his team did nothing wrong. The force now knows the fate of the Labour leader and his deputy is in its hands, which may make officers think twice before issuing either of them with a fine. So far, all the political pressure has come from a handful of Tory MPs – and the Daily Mail – demanding they act. With the potential for further fines for Johnson in the coming days, and more clear cut evidence of partying in No 10 than took place in Durham, the heat is still on the prime minister – for now.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer’s moment of drama is an unexpected gamble,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/keir-starmer-gamble-resignation-labour
5/10/2022,"A US firm known for betting against companies’ share prices has said Elon Musk could submit a lower bid for Twitter, owing to a slump in tech stocks and a weak financial performance at the social media platform. Hindenburg Research said there was a “significant chance” that the Tesla chief executive will seek to pay less than the agreed bid price of $54.20 (£43.90) a share, which values Twitter at $44bn and has been accepted by the company’s board. “We are supportive of Musk’s efforts to take Twitter private and see a significant chance the deal will close at a lower price,” said Hindenburg in a note published on Monday. It said the tech-dominated Nasdaq stock market had fallen sharply since the world’s richest person revealed he had taken an initial stake in Twitter on 4 April, implying a lower share price for the social media plaform, whose value has been held up by the takeover situation. Hindenburg said that if Musk walked away, Twitter’s shares could be caught up in the negative sentiment surrounding the Nasdaq and fall by 50%. Hindenburg added that Twitter’s recent quarterly results had been poor and had not been priced into the stock, while Musk could pay a $1bn breakup fee to walk away from the deal. The investment research firm also dismissed speculation that Twitter could enforce a clause in the takeover agreement that required the multibillionaire to complete the deal. “Musk has incredible leverage to renegotiate should he choose to,” said Hindenburg, which said it had taken a short position on Twitter. A short position is where an entity borrows shares in a company in the expectation that the price will fall. The entity sells those shares and then expects to buy them back at a lower price before returning them to the lender – pocketing the profit. Shares in Twitter fell 2.6% at $48.50 in afternoon trading in New York. Hindenburg said the deal as structured would leave Twitter with a high amount of debt and would make it difficult for Musk to achieve his goal of reducing the company’s reliance on advertising. Adverts account for 90% of Twitter’s $5bn in annual revenue. The deal is being part-funded through $27.25bn of cash, $7.1bn of which is coming from a group of investors and the rest from Musk. A further $6.25bn is in loans secured against Musk’s shares in Tesla, with $13bn provided in debt financing. The bank debt will cost Twitter around $800m-$900m per year in interest payments. Hindenburg rose to prominence last year by taking an aggressive stance against special purpose acquisition companies, or Spacs, which are blank cheque vehicles that raise money from investors first and seek businesses to buy afterwards.",News/Technology,"Elon Musk may try to reprice $44bn Twitter bid, says US short-seller",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/09/elon-musk-may-try-to-reprice-dollars-44bn-twitter-bid-us-short-seller-lower-offer
