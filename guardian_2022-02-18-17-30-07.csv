2/18/2022,"Yoko Ono is one of the biggest names in rock history – and yet her music is frequently overlooked, if not actively ignored. Years of frustration at this state of affairs motivated Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard to helm this tribute album, intended to demonstrate the breadth, charm and brilliance of her output. Gibbard is not the first person to attempt to rescue Ono’s reputation, but the crack team he has assembled to cover her songs – David Byrne, the Flaming Lips, Sharon Van Etten, US Girls, Sudan Archives, Japanese Breakfast – will appeal to listeners previously unaware of the source material.  In the same vein, many of the covers make Ono’s strongly idiosyncratic, almost outsider songs more palatable. Sometimes this merely entails exposing the crowd-pleasing loveliness lingering just below the surface, as on Jay Som’s sublime dream-pop rework of Growing Pain. Others iron out some of the essential weirdness: Byrne and Yo La Tengo’s sonorous, barbershop-style version of Who Has Seen the Wind is far less jarring than the hauntingly childlike vocals and Elizabethan-style instrumental of the original. It is only the Flaming Lips that manage to make Ono odder, adding extra trippiness to Mrs Lennon. Whether Ocean Child’s tendency to replace the startling strangeness of Ono’s originals with something easier on the ear is doing her a disservice is debatable: in 2016, she said she thought her “music was beautiful all along”. This album proves there is appeal to her songwriting that goes far beyond her own inimitable presence – but it’s hard not to miss that presence. In fact, it’s impossible not to repeatedly turn Ocean Child off, and instead seek out the originality and uniqueness of the genuine article. Presumably, it’s what Gibbard would want.",Arts/Culture,Various artists: Ocean Child: Songs of Yoko Ono review – tribute to brilliance of rock icon’s music,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/18/various-artists-ocean-child-songs-of-yoko-ono-review-canvasback-music-atlantic-records
2/18/2022,"Retail sales rebounded in January as shoppers returned to the high street after the disruption caused by the Omicron variant eased. Official figures showed that sales increased by 1.9% in Great Britain last month, with much of the boost to sales credited to an increase in the sales of furniture and DIY tools as households refreshed their homes.  Food sales fell below their pre-pandemic level for the first time, as more people returned to eating out, and online sales and the proportion of online sales dropped to its lowest level since March 2020 because people ventured out more. The sales uplift was stronger than City economists had forecast, and compared with a 4% fall in the run-up to Christmas, after the Office for National Statistics downgraded its previous estimate of a 3.7% drop in sales. Analysts warned, however, that sales were likely to be hit over the coming months and send more shops closer to the edge of bankruptcy, as the cost of living crisis intensifies and the squeeze on wage packets weighs on consumer confidence. Inflation increased to 5.5% in January, driven by a rise in the cost of energy and clothing and footwear. The energy regulator, Ofgem, has said the cap on household energy will increase in April, sending average bills up by almost £700 a year. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG, said: “The retail sector started the year in relatively good health and not facing further Covid restrictions on the ability to trade.” He warned, though: “Retailers will be acutely aware that the cost of living squeeze could see consumers scrutinising their spending more over the coming weeks and months, impacting trade. “This picture will be compounded if those who managed to save during the pandemic decide the time isn’t right to spend what they’ve accrued.” Petrol and diesel sales also rebounded in January after workers began to return to the office and consumers made more trips to out-of-town shopping centres. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that while official figures showed sales volumes above pre-pandemic levels, sales volumes were still 0.5% below their average level in the fourth quarter of 2021, “and the near-term outlook remains overcast”. He said: “Households’ real disposable income looks set to fall by nearly 2% this year, the most since 1977. And while high-income households have amassed considerable savings, we judge they are more likely to splurge them on big-ticket items, such as cars or foreign holidays, than on retail store purchases. “In addition, the below-average level of consumers’ confidence suggests that households will be reluctant to borrow more to smooth out the real income shock, unlike in 2017, when sentiment was higher.”",News/Business,Retail sales bounce back in Great Britain as Omicron fears ease,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/18/retail-sales-bounce-back-great-britain-omicron-fears-ease
2/18/2022,"Western Australia’s hard border will come down on 3 March, as premier acknowledges that sealing off the state has become “ineffective” in the face of a surging local outbreak. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, announced the new border reopening date on Friday, allowing quarantine-free travel for those who have received three vaccine doses.  The announcement comes four weeks after backflipping on his initial promise to ease entry requirements from 5 February due to the spread of Omicron in other jurisdictions and WA’s low booster rate. The state’s reopening will happen nearly 700 days after WA first sealed itself off from other states in April 2020, with its international border remaining tightly controlled since the federal government initially shut Australia’s borders in March 2020. WA had been the last Australian state to succeed in avoiding significant community transmission of Covid. However, local cases have surged in recent days, with a record 194 new local infections reported on Friday. McGowan explained on Friday that the new date had been chosen as daily Covid numbers in eastern states had fallen from their peaks in January and WA’s third dose vaccination rates was increasing. He also acknowledged the inevitable surge in cases from the current outbreak in his state. “I firmly believe saving West Australian lives has been worth every effort over the past two years,” McGowan said. “Eventually there comes a point where the border is ineffective when you get to high case numbers within the state,” he said. “It is plain to see that four weeks of caution has paid dividends. It means it is now far safer to relax our hard border settings,” McGowan said. From 12:01am on 3 March, travellers who have had three doses of Covid-19 vaccine will able to enter WA, however they will still have to complete a G2G border pass prior to entry and take a rapid antigen test within 12 hours of arrival. Unvaccinated travellers from interstate will not be able to enter WA. The reopening of the international border will be in line with the Commonwealth government’s previously announced plan that is already in place in all other jurisdictions – which requires two doses of Covid vaccine. In WA, unvaccinated returning Australians will have to undergo seven days of hotel quarantine, with a smaller cap of 70 people per week. New mask rules, as well as density and gathering restrictions, will also be introduced ahead of the 3 March reopening, to protect the state’s health system from being overwhelmed by current local spread of the Omicron variant. Amber-Jade Sanderson, WA’s health minister, said health authorities were expecting a peak in local infections at the end of March. Modelling predicts this will 10,000 daily infections. After “peak immunity” is reached in March, the modelling predicted that four people will die each day as a result of ongoing transmission of Covid. From 21 February, masks will be required for indoor settings across the state. In Perth, Peel, South-West, Wheatbelt, Great Southern and the Pilbara, additional settings include a two person per square metre rule that will apply to gyms, hospitality and entertainment venues. Home gatherings will also be limited to 30 people, and outdoor gatherings limited to 200 people in those regions. On Friday, McGowan said “this date [3 March] is locked in and I can’t foresee a situation where it would change”. Today we announced the new date for WA’s full border opening – and it’s worth talking through how we got here.Four weeks ago, on January 20, we took the difficult decision to delay Western Australia’s full border opening. pic.twitter.com/zEpV2tQRoR “I know removing the hard border is a step that some in the community have been looking forward to for some time,” he tweeted. “I note there are also Western Australians who will be apprehensive, but I want them to know – WA is prepared.” “We have the supplies, we have the policy settings. We have one of the most vaccinated populations in the world,” he said. McGowan said the notice period “of nearly two weeks gives the community and businesses time to prepare and make plans”, and urged residents not yet boosted to get their third vaccine dose.",News/Australia news,Western Australia to reopen 3 March to triple-vaccinated travellers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/western-australia-to-reopen-3-march-to-triple-vaccinated-travellers
2/18/2022,"What price, hype? When does publicity turn into crushing expectations that can make Mikaela Shiffrin or Simone Biles develop a sudden case of the yips or withdraw from competition altogether?  And is society getting any better at recognizing the humanity of those who walk the high wires of elite sports, where one momentary slip can undo a lifetime of work – if we define their work solely by what happens when people tune into the Olympics every four years? We’re still obsessed with “busts” and those who “choke”. Great athletes’ careers are considered unfulfilled if they don’t win the biggest prizes – even in team sports, where one athlete can only do so much. One 2012 list of biggest disappointments included LeBron James, reasoning that he had never won a championship. Oops. More disturbing is the tendency to apply the “bust” label to people who suffered serious injuries. Greg Oden, the No 1 pick in the 2007 NBA draft, has recognized that he’ll always be known as a “bust” even though his career was derailed not by a lack of skill but by seven knee surgeries. Bobby Hurley is sometimes considered an NBA “bust” rather than someone who was lucky to be alive after a horrific car accident early in his rookie season. A lot of baseball “busts” are pitchers whose arms were worn to death by demanding coaches well before they could reach the major leagues. In some respects, we’re getting better. When we apply the term “GOAT” to Shiffrin or Biles, it means “Greatest of All Time,” not someone who gave away a victory. But this is, of course, the era of social media. Shiffrin has made it known that she appreciates the widespread support she has received during her troubles in China, but she also notices the haters, most of whom are surely compensating for their own shortcomings by tearing down someone who has accomplished so much. Dealing with trolls is a skill she developed well before these Olympics. Patriotism also feeds Olympic pressure. Lindsey Jacobellis was reviled by many Americans after a showboating move at the end of the 2006 snowboardcross final cost her a gold medal. Had such a move occurred in the X Games, it would’ve been seen as just one of those things snowboarders do. But she did it in the jingoistic setting of the Olympics, where fans are far less forgiving. She’s also the GOAT in her sport, but it took an unlikely gold medal this year to make people realize it. The sports world also may not have fully appreciated the strains that top athletes face and given them the support systems they really need. In the combined event on Thursday, Shiffrin set herself up for what would be, under typical circumstances, a surefire win. She finished the downhill with a significant margin over those who were good enough in the slalom to challenge her. But she also gave an interview with NBC, saying it was difficult to shake visions of missing a gate as she had in the giant slalom and the slalom. Her attitude seemed chipper, but are those the words anyone would want to hear from someone whose only true opponent at that point was herself? In recent years, the mental side of sports has moved far beyond fire-and-brimstone halftime speeches. The US women’s soccer team credited much of their success in their breakthrough years to one Colleen Hacker, a psychologist who won over the players with unusual tactics such as duplicating Rocky Balboa’s famed run up a series of concrete steps, drawing both humor and inspiration from what has become a sports cliche. Did any US coach see Shiffrin speak and place a call to someone like Hacker? We don’t know right now, in part because Shiffrin graciously refuses to make excuses. Search social media long enough, and in addition to those who spout their ignorance and hate, you may find people blaming the fake snow at Beijing 2022. Shiffrin says nothing of the sort, demonstrating far greater toughness than supposed tough guys like former MMA fighter Tito Ortiz, who would report to postfight press conferences with a sudden revelation of some phantom injury that kept him from winning. In the case of the Olympics, athletes face greater pressures because the spotlight is so much greater every four years than it is in the rest of their careers. Shiffrin thankfully already has three Olympic medals to show to a public that knows little of her six world championships and three overall World Cup season trophies. She considered retiring after her father’s sudden death in February 2020, and if she had, her career legacy would’ve still been complete. Any medal, any world championship and any World Cup win she receives for the rest of her career just makes it more difficult for any future skier to match what she has done. Such success, though, can make us think all of this is easy. Clearly, it’s not. Many Olympic sports require confidence in being able to deliver clutch performances without error. That’s why we watch so nervously when a Nathan Chen or Simone Biles takes to the ice or beam. Chen has three world championships but fared poorly in the short program in the 2018 Olympics, ruining his chances at the podium despite a stellar free skate. Who watched Chen in Beijing without fretting that one slip of the skate would define his career in the eyes of people who don’t know what else he has accomplished? By comparison, American team sports stars have much more leeway. An interception can always be followed by a touchdown pass. The best basketball players still miss roughly half their shots. Baseball greatness can be defined by 50 home runs over 162 games. In the Olympics, we remember moments, and our minds often drift toward the negative. Dan Jansen’s falls in the 1988 Olympics, just after learning of the death of his sister, may linger in the collective consciousness more than the gold medal he won in 1994. Decathlete Dan O’Brien rebounded from his Olympic trials miscue in 1992 to win gold in 1996, but the former was a shocking result after a media blitz by Reebok featuring him as one half “Dan and Dave,” two favorites for 1992 gold. Star athletes deserve the hype. It builds up their names and stories before we see them in the Olympics. It may even provide them with belated recognition for their accomplishments on stages most casual observers don’t see. But these athletes also deserve support – first, to help them remain calm and confident in pressure-packed environments, and second, to empathize when their quests fall short for any reason we can or can’t find.

2/18/2022,"Kumanjayi Walker could have survived being shot the first time by Constable Zachary Rolfe, a court has heard, but the second bullet fired by the police officer likely caused the Warlpiri man’s death. Rolfe is charged with murdering Walker in Yuendumu, a remote community 300km from Alice Springs, on 9 November 2019. He has pleaded not guilty.  The court has heard Rolfe shot Walker three times, but the first shot is not subject to any charges. It occurred only moments after Walker stabbed Rolfe with a pair of small scissors and happened while the pair were about a metre apart. The murder charge relates to the second and third shots fired by Rolfe, which the prosecution allege were fired at point-blank range while Walker was being controlled by another officer. Dr Keith Towsey, a trauma surgeon at two Brisbane hospitals, told Rolfe’s trial on Friday that a review of Walker’s injuries showed the second bullet passed from one side of his body to the other. It penetrated Walker’s liver, spleen, a kidney and right lung while doing so, he said, and likely proved fatal. Towsey said that while the injuries caused by the first and third shots were still serious, they were unlikely to have proved fatal if Walker had received hospital treatment. All three shots hit Walker in the torso. Towsey also said the first shot was unlikely to have incapacitated Walker to the extent he would have no longer posed a threat with the scissors, as it would not have diminished the function of his right arm, which had been holding the weapon. Under cross-examination by David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, Towsey was asked if he had previously been approached by the Northern Territory police or director of public prosecutions to express an opinion about whether the pair of scissors used by Walker could cause a fatal wound. He said he was asked his opinion by an NT police officer, and also emailed a photo of the scissors, but after expressing his opinion he did not provide a formal report. Edwardson called for any record of the communication between Towsey and NT police, including the email containing the photo of the scissors, to be presented to the court. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The prosecutor, Philip Strickland SC, said he was not aware of the police approach to Towsey. Senior Constable Anthony Hawkings, the only direct witness to the shooting of Walker who has appeared at the trial, also continued his evidence on Friday. He was asked about an earlier statement he gave to police about the moment he described as when “the shit hit the fan” – the 2.6-second gap between the first shot and the second shot at a property known as House 511. Hawkings was asked by Strickland about his previous statement where he described a moment seemingly before the second shot was fired when he looked in the doorway to the house.

The prosecution allege Walker no longer posed a threat as the arm that had been carrying the scissors was pinned under his body, and Eberl was on top of him. Hawkings told the court on Friday that because the incident happened so quickly, he could not be sure that when he made that statement he was referring specifically to the time between the first and second shots, or to his general impression of the overall event. Under cross-examination by Edwardson, and after again watching body-worn camera footage of the incident, Hawkings clarified that he did not believe Walker had been contained, even after being shot on the second and third occasions. He also said Walker was still holding the scissors after he had been shot for the third time.

2/18/2022,"The return of Leatherface, the Ed Gein-inspired mass murderer who’s never happier than when he’s chainsawing nubile youngsters in half, might not be much of a return for hardcore horror fans (he’s been in at least one film every decade since the 70s, the last as recently as 2017) but in Netflix’s new franchise restarter, he’s back with a particularly modern brand of vengeance. Following in the sluggish footsteps of Michael Myers, who stabbed his way back to relevance in 2018 after we were insisted upon to ignore the mostly heinous Halloween sequels (H20 remains an underrated bright spot) and allow for a clean slate, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series is going down a similar retcon route.  Rather than expecting us to have endured the three direct sequels, the remake, the prequel to that remake and the 3D sequel to the original that had previously tried to ignore the other sequels (and the prequel that then came after), the makers of Texas Chainsaw Massacre only ask that our knowledge be as simple as the back-to-basics title. It has never been a series steeped in particularly complex mythology – a silent lug kills and cuts up outsiders while wearing a mask made of human skin – but the exhausting attempts to resurrect and retell have expanded and confused the universe to a point of exasperated weariness. There’s been a similarly messy route to the screen for this latest iteration – an early Covid shoot, a change of director after production began, rumours of unimpressed test audiences, a big screen release cancelled, a sell-off to Netflix – enough to make one wonder if it’s time to retire, disable and bury the chainsaw for good. But against considerable odds, a very, very low bar has been met and then shuffled over with this mostly effective and incredibly nasty update, a jolting little slasher that should repulse and satisfy those with a suitably depraved idea of what they are clicking into. It is almost 50 years since a group of teens were brutally murdered by Leatherface, a refresher provided by OG narrator John Laroquette in the opening scene, served with a reminder that the massacre was survived by Sally (now played by acclaimed Irish stage actor Olwen Fouéré after Marilyn Burns died in 2014), who has been trying to track down the killer of her friends ever since. Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Dante (Jacob Latimore) are bullish San Francisco-based Gen Zs, heading south for a business opportunity who have purchased the derelict town of Harlow with the idea of auctioning off retail space and turning it into a hipster haven for those bored of big city life (a local refers to them as “gentri-fuckers”). But on arrival, with Melody’s sister (Eighth Grade breakout Elsie Fisher) and Dante’s girlfriend (Nell Hudson) they encounter a resident who refuses to be turfed out, a former orphanage-runner (Alice Krige) who insists that she still retains the deed for her property and so will not be going anywhere. A stand-off ensues, albeit a short-lived one when the elderly woman collapses, being rushed to hospital with her one mysterious grown-up charge alongside. But when she dies on the journey there, all hell breaks loose. It will not take a series expert to figure out who her grown-up charge turns out to be and what might be on his mind as he returns to the town but it’s a little foggier as to who exactly we should be rooting for as blood and guts hit the fan. The script, from up-and-coming horror writer Chris Thomas Devlin (who has two Seth Rogen-produced films in the offing) views the invading twentysomethings as thoughtlessly disrespectful rather than maliciously so, but makes it clear that theirs is a situation of their own making (they make for an incredibly hard-to-empathise with ensemble). He’s not exactly asking us to cheer Leatherface on as he dispatches them in a variety of disgusting ways but each death is backgrounded with the knowledge that this really didn’t need to happen. Never is this clearer than in a much-ridiculed trailer scene, where a party bus of potential investors decide to film Leatherface on their phone so he can get cancelled, rather than, you know, try to run away. It’s as remarkably stupid as it sounds and the ebulliently vile, shockingly staged carnage that follows feels tailor-made for eye-rolling older viewers, even if some original fans might find the brief lapse into absurdist comedy a little jarring. The limp return of Sally, a shameless piece of post-Halloween remodelling, is mostly a dud, the character never really meaning much to us in the first place, and instead, Devlin tries to give his film heart through Fisher’s troubled sister. But her backstory – a school shooting survivor – and journey – her phobia of guns is overcome in order to take on Leatherface – is in quite astonishingly poor taste, a nasty taste in the mouth that feels closer to NRA propaganda than Texas Chainsaw sequel. It doesn’t help that Fisher is also an unlikely fit, the same out-of-place awkwardness that made her so very perfect in Eighth Grade making her feel simply miscast here. In a breathlessly brutal 83-minute runtime, there’s little time for thinking, probably for the best, given the thinness of the material and some of the mistakes made within it, but first-time director David Blue Garcia finds ample time for suspense, making the most of his unique location and milking just about enough seat-edge frights from the reheated ingredients. It’s staggeringly gory, following on from last year’s equally sadistic Halloween Kills, but also sprightly enough for it not to feel too grim (an attention-grabbing final shock is both horrendous and hilarious). In a franchise that has been close to death for many years, it doesn’t take much for Texas ’22 to shock it back to life.

2/18/2022,"Peter loves his bikes; we now have a garage, but he still keeps one in the houseWhen I first met my husband Peter, he lived in a flat and kept a large, powerful motorbike, a Kawasaki Z1, in the hall. Trying to squeeze past it with shopping was a nightmare. Then there was a smaller vintage bike, called a Gilera, in the living room and another huge bike, a Ducati, in the bedroom. I was surrounded by them.  We recently bought a house together with a beautiful garage and I thought: great, the bikes will be happy and comfortable there. But then a storm approached. Peter began to get agitated and worried that a branch would crash through the roof and damage the bikes. Before I knew it, the Gilera had snuck into the house again. He said it would only be there for a few days. But after the storm passed it was still there and ended up staying for weeks. A few months later, we got a puppy. It started biting everything – that’s when Peter finally returned the Gilera to the garage. I think the only reason he did it was to protect it from the puppy, not because I wanted it gone. After it disappeared I felt joy. I thought: I’m not going to trip over it or find bits of it in my kitchen. I often say Peter loves his Gilera more than he loves me. He’s had it since he was 16. The two bigger bikes stay in the garage, but once the puppy stops biting, Peter wants to bring the Gilera back into the house. But it creates a mess. I’ve had a lot of stains on our carpets and flooring. One time, Peter hung lights around one of the bikes to make it look like a nice art display, but something happened and he burned a hole in the carpet. We’ve also bought a posh dishwasher – and Peter loves to stick bits of his motorbike into it, which I find alarming. I’m not against Peter having his bikes – we’ve taken several trips with me on the back, and I go to his vintage motorbike shows. But bikes in the house are a hazard. The Gilera really needs to stay in the garage unless there’s a real emergency. The bigger bikes stay out entirely. Sandy’s paperweight collection is on display; it’s only fair I can bring in one little motorcycle Vintage motorbikes are things of beauty, they make the house a better place. It’s also widely accepted that they work better when you store them in dry, warm places so I really feel they should be allowed in the house. After we bought this house, we learned that a branch from the walnut tree above our garage had once blown off during a gale and crashed through the roof. I really didn’t want that to happen during the storm when the Gilera was in there, so I moved it inside. Sandy wasn’t pleased. She said: “What the heck is this doing in my house?” The Gilera is the only bike I really want inside. It was built in 1973 and it’s a gorgeous little thing. With the Z1, I do admit that it was difficult to walk past in my old place. I remember one time my bag got caught on a hook and split and the shopping went everywhere. But when you’re careful it’s usually not a problem. I’ve also never put any bike parts in the dishwasher that are greasy or oily. There’s actually a lot more grease from a tray you cook chicken on. Sandy’s extensive paperweight collection is displayed in our home – it’s only fair that I’m allowed to bring in a precious little motorcycle. People have preconceived ideas of what should be in houses, and they can be unfair. My wife feels that houses are for “nice” things. Her friends agree with her and gang up on me. But in my eyes, motorbikes have the same status as a work of art. The time I tried to hang lights around the bike was a terrible accident. The lights swung on to the carpet and burned holes in it – but I was attempting to treat the bike as an art display. It’s not true that I love bikes more than I love Sandy. I have told her: “If it came between the Gilera and you, the Gilera would be gone in an instant.” She’s never asked me to get rid of it, though. I think to compromise I can ask Sandy before I need to move a bike inside the house next time, but I can’t promise there won’t be a next time. Should Peter move his bike out once and for all?The ridiculousness of Peter’s first sentence says it all. Unless they can build an extension for the bikes, the garage should be adapted to make it suitable. To compromise, Sandy should reduce the number of paperweights on display.Alison, 61When Peter lived alone, he was free to store his bikes wherever he wanted. Now that he and Sandy own a home together, there should be some compromise. Sandy’s paperweights aren’t really a comparison; they aren’t obtrusive and haven’t caused damage to the home.Sam, 33 They clearly love each other, though Sandy has made it clear that she simply doesn’t want the bike in the house (or the dishwasher) for cleanliness and clutter reasons. Perfectly understandable.Michelle, 50It’s reasonable that Sandy doesn’t want to feel as if she’s living in a garage when there is one outside. Why not trim that tree branch and turn the garage into a shrine for the Gilera and other bikes to really shine?Olivia, 33 Sorry Peter, but you’re guilty. I can’t agree with many of the things you said, not least that bikes “make the house a better place”. Why not develop the garage into a garden house, or even build a small cabin that could serve as a place to not just store but display them as well?Charlie, 44 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Peter move his motorbike out once and for all?

2/18/2022,"It is a memorable photograph. Outside the Old Bailey on 14 March 1991 stand the Birmingham Six, free at last after 16 years in prison for a mass murder in which they played no part. At the centre of this happy band, scarf askew and beaming with pleasure and pride, is the man whose diligence as an investigative journalist and later MP has led to their victory in the court of appeal. Now, more than 30 years later, that same man, Chris Mullin, will himself be back at the Old Bailey on 23 February facing an action brought against him under the Terrorism Act of 2000 to make him reveal the sources of his information all those years ago. The Birmingham Six were jailed for life in 1975 for an IRA bomb attack on two pubs the previous year, which killed 21 people and injured more than 200. It was a grim, unforgivable crime and understandably the police were anxious to nail those responsible. They swiftly arrested five men on their way to Ireland for a funeral and a sixth the following day. After days of brutal interrogation, four “confessed”, admissions that were immediately retracted once their violent ordeal ended. The government’s forensic scientist claimed that at least two of them had been in touch with the explosive nitroglycerine. That evidence was discredited by the time of the trial – many household products and notably the pack of cards with which the men had been playing on their train journey before their arrest gave similar results – but the Six were convicted and jailed for life.  The late Peter Chippindale, who covered the trial for the Guardian, told his journalist friend Mullin that he felt that the police had got the wrong people. A spark was lit. While working for Granada Television’s World in Action programme, Mullin set about trying to discover the truth by tracking down those really responsible. If it was possible to prove that others had carried out the attack, the Six could be shown to be innocent. Eventually he found the real men involved and interviewed them on the understanding that he would not identify them. In 1986, he published his account, Error of Judgement, and the following year became an MP for Sunderland South and continued to campaign. The Sun noted his persistence thus: “Loony MP backs bomb gang”. Other Irish cases – the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven, Judith Ward – were also being exposed as miscarriages of justice. At their appeal on that fateful day in 1991, the Six were cleared. Some of them, Billy Power and Paddy Hill, in particular, have since lent their names and energies to free others wrongly convicted. Then in 2018, under pressure from relatives of those killed and the organisation Justice 4 the 21, came a decision to reinvestigate the case. The West Midlands police, a very different crew from the disgraced Serious Crime Squad of the 1970s, embarked on a fresh inquiry. Mullin was asked to surrender all his data: notebooks, manuscripts and so on. He provided the notes of his interview with one of the men, Michael Murray, who was the bomb-maker and who had died 20 years ago, but declined to provide anything that would break his agreement. The police now seek a court order from a judge to force him to comply or face jail. There are precedents. In 1963, Reg Foster, the Daily Sketch’s crime reporter and Brendan Mulholland of the Daily Mail were jailed for contempt of court for three and six months respectively for refusing to reveal the sources for stories about John Vassall, who had been convicted the previous year of being a Soviet spy. At the inquiry into the affair Foster delivered an impassioned speech in which he said: “I have been in journalism for 40 years. From the first I was taught always to respect sources of information.” He added that he had lost many Fleet Street colleagues in the second world war and “I would feel guilty of the greatest possible treachery to them if I were to assist … in this matter.” The Guardian faced its own crisis in the case of the civil servant Sarah Tisdall, who was jailed for six months in 1984 after leaking details to the paper about the arrival of American cruise missiles in Britain. The then editor of the Guardian, the late Peter Preston, was prepared to go to prison to defy a court order to provide material that would identify her, but was advised that it was more likely that an ever-increasing fine would be imposed on the newspaper. He described passing on the information as the “worst day” of his editorship and offered his resignation. While Mullin has the strong support of the National Union of Journalists and from politicians ranging from Labour’s Jack Straw and Charlie Falconer to the Conservatives’ David Davis, he has been called “scum” by relatives of the victims and asked, “How do you sleep at night?” While one has great sympathy for the bereaved, the betrayal of sources – which in this case would be very unlikely to lead to any convictions – is not the path to be taken in any pursuit of justice. Journalists already enjoy little public respect. An Ipsos Mori poll in 2020 put the percentage of people who trust journalists to tell the truth at 23%; only politicians rank lower. Mullin is absolutely right to stand firm – especially at a time when attempts are being made to amend the Official Secrets Act to make punishing whistleblowers easier. If journalists routinely betray sources and break their word why should anyone ever trust them and how will scandals like that of the Birmingham Six – the likes of which continue to this day – ever be uncovered?

2/18/2022,"With Vladimir Putin’s troops massed on the Ukrainian border, governments in the US and Europe have vowed to retaliate by imposing harsh economic restrictions. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has warned of “the toughest sanctions regime against Russia we have ever had”. Of all the countries threatening economic retaliation, the UK has an outsized ability to inflict damage. There is thought to be more Russian gold in London than in any other city in the world. Not only in the Chelsea mansions that house the families of oligarchs, but on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).  Since the 1990s, companies whose shares are traded in Moscow have turned to London to raise money through what are known as secondary listings. They range from state-backed oil and gas producers Rosneft and Gazprom, to state-run banks VTB and Sberbank, to independent mining companies like Norilsk Nickel that have no state ownership. In total, 31 Russian companies are listed on the LSE, with a combined market value of £468bn, according to the data company S&P Global. The companies are not only a crucial part of the Russian economy, they also directly fund a large part of the Russian state. London-listed Russian oil, gas and mining companies paid their government £39bn in taxes in 2020, according to a Guardian analysis of payments to government disclosures. That revenue is hugely important to the Putin regime: Russia spent £41.7bn on its military in 2019, 11.4% of government spending, according to the World Bank’s latest figures. Now those companies are under the spotlight, as legislators in London and Washington ponder what form sanctions should take. A statutory instrument laid before parliament last week has given the UK government the power to impose sanctions on those “carrying on business of economic significance to the government of Russia” as well as companies supportive of the Russian government, and sectors of strategic significance, including energy, mining and financial services. While not every Russian-linked company will be a target for sanctions, the reality is most of the London-listed companies potentially fall within the definition of having economic or strategic significance to the Russian government. A draft US sanctions bill that is thought to have the backing of the White House explicitly names 12 Russian banks as potential targets for sanctions and would also give powers to hit companies in the oil and gas and mining sectors. If carried out, the US threats would represent “massive sanctions at a level we’ve not seen before”, including after Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, said John Smith, a partner at US law firm Morrison and Foerster who led the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac), the department’s key sanctions enforcement body, until 2018. No companies or individuals have yet been designated, but the new legislation now allows for the speedy designation of a very broad range of individuals and entities. Under the most extreme scenario, companies operating in the UK, US or EU – including most of the world’s major financial institutions – could be forbidden from any transactions with sanctioned entities. That could mean the indefinite suspension of their shares, and an inability to issue new debt or shares in London. Asked whether the UK was likely to impose sanctions that would damage the interests of big British companies, Bernardine Adkins, a partner at the London law firm Gowling WLG, said: “I’ll believe it when I see it.” “The modern way of sanctions tends to be very focused, and they’re not sweeping to hurt the economy,” she added. Even if sanctions are imposed, there can be ways around them. Smith said he expected some “flexibility” in the US approach to the energy sector in particular, given the importance of Russian gas to the EU economy. Governments can take a “facts and circumstances” approach to allow limited licences for work with sanctioned entities. The most obvious companies of economic significance to the Russian government, based on tax take, are Rosneft, Gazprom and Lukoil, who together paid 3.2tn roubles (£31bn) in tax and other payments to the Russian government in 2020. All three are primarily listed on the Moscow Exchange, but have secondary listings in London. A spokesperson for Rosneft, the large oil company run by the former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Sechin, said the company was “a commercial organisation” that had no “political agenda”. The spokesperson highlighted a list of major institutional shareholders ranging from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock in the US to British asset managers such as Schroders, abrdn and Marshall Wace, and said it made “a notable contribution to the sustainability of the UK energy market”. Gazprom, Norilsk Nickel and Sberbank did not comment. Lukoil and VTB did not respond to requests for comment. Some companies with primary London listings also operate in sectors deemed by the UK government as strategically significant to Russia. The FTSE 100 steelmaker Evraz is incorporated in London but has significant operations in Russia. The company is 29% owned by Roman Abramovich, the Russian owner of Chelsea football club. Lawyers for Abramovich disputed that he or Evraz fitted the criteria for potential designation for sanctions. They added: “It would be ludicrous to suggest that our client has any responsibility or influence over the behaviour of the Russian state.” The London-based aluminium miner En+ Group, which raised $1.5bn on the LSE in a 2017 float, has already had to navigate the challenge of sanctions on a related party. It is part-owned by Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who has been on the US sanctions list since 2018. En+ managed to escape US sanctions by reducing Deripaska’s ownership to 45% and appointing other directors in a plan devised by Greg Barker, a former UK energy minister and Conservative peer who is the company’s chair. The company is still thought to make monthly reports to Ofac. En+ declined to comment. However, Deripaska has taken legal action to challenge US sanctions. He has denied any wrongdoing and said US allegations against him were based on “false rumour and innuendo”. At their peak in 2007, Russian companies raised $19.7bn on London’s equity markets, according to the data company Dealogic. Roman Borisovich, a former investment banker and founder of the anti-corruption group ClampK, said the London listing is particularly valuable because it gives an “independently verifiable measurement of their capitalisation”. “Traders are more likely to trust the London price than a quote from the Moscow exchange, where you don’t know what the liquidity is like or what market manipulation is there,” he said. “That’s really valuable when you’re looking to raise money by issuing bonds or shares, or enter any other financial transaction.” The possibility of sanctions for London-listed companies poses tricky questions for the London Stock Exchange Group, as well as the City investment bankers, lawyers and accountants who serve them. Russian companies are likely to account for only a small portion of the LSE’s fee income, but it has in the past enthusiastically welcomed Russian money – even going so far as mounting a roadshow to Moscow in 2011 to drum up custom. That mood has changed along with the geopolitics since the Crimea annexation, but Russian companies have still raised an average of $1.8bn a year on the LSE between the 2014 Crimea invasion and 2021, or £14bn in total, according to data from Dealogic. There were five equity capital raises by Russian companies in 2021, dominated by Fix Price, a Russian retailer (albeit incorporated in the British Virgin Islands), which raised $1.8bn. Sanctioned companies can, depending on the details, be suspended from trading and removed from the LSE’s stock market indices – although there is little in the rules on what would happen if suspensions were to last years. The London Stock Exchange Group declined to comment. Whether the UK will clamp down is an open question, says Thomas Mayne, a visiting fellow in the Russia and Eurasia programme at the thinktank Chatham House. “London is open to business and this has produced a two-faced approach to Russia,” he says. “We’re happy for the money to stay here but we’re not happy with its foreign policy priorities. We’ve somehow not made the link.”",News/World news,Which London-listed Russian firms could be hit by sanctions?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/which-london-listed-russian-firms-could-be-hit-by-sanctions
2/18/2022,"A key rule that bars people with temporary or fluctuating conditions from getting the disability support pension should be reviewed, a Senate inquiry has found. The Labor-Greens-dominated committee’s report, published on Friday, said the evidence pointed to “serious flaws with the [disability support pension], its underlying policy framework, the way that it is administered, and how applicants are able to access it”.  Eligibility for the disability support pension, currently set at $967.50 a fortnight for a single person, was significantly tightened by the Gillard and Abbott governments, meaning thousands of people now find themselves on the lower jobseeker payment. Guardian Australia has reported extensively on how the rules – particularly a requirement that a condition is “fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised” – mean many people are left to survive on the $45-a-day dole, despite Centrelink and job agencies acknowledging they are too sick to work. Among those affected is 65-year-old cervical cancer patient Lynette Penfold, who was denied the pension and forced to live on jobseeker until she was diagnosed as terminal, and George Upjohn, a 29-year-old former pilot who has been left on the dole despite battling brain cancer. In another case revealed by Guardian Australia, Doug Reidy, who developed severe PTSD after the black summer bushfires, had his claim rejected because he could not access mental health services in his regional community, which he needed to be considered “fully treated”. The Senate inquiry report also said the process to apply for the pension was “long, complex and not well understood” – a common complaint among benefit recipients – with the evidence required to make a claim “difficult to obtain and cost-prohibitive”. “The committee heard that the challenges for people with disability navigating this system are varied, and can be exacerbated by their condition, and personal and financial circumstances,” the report found. It recommended the government review the rule that “a condition be ‘fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised’” and how it is “preventing people with conditions that are complex, fluctuating, or deteriorate over time” getting the pension. Under the rules, applicants must score 20 “points” for a particular condition on the “impairment tables”, meaning those with several conditions that might add up to 20 points generally have their claims rejected. The report recommended the government consider reforming the rules to allow people to accumulate 20 points across several impairments. It also called for the department of social services to review the program of support requirement, which has forced thousands of pension applicants to first undertake up to 18 months of job search and training before they can get on to the payment. The inquiry chair, Greens senator Janet Rice, said the report set a “clear blueprint for action by whoever forms government after the election”. “Many of those who’ve been unfairly denied access to the DSP have been forced to wait years. They must not wait any longer,” Rice said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Aside from a commitment to scrap the cashless debit card, federal Labor has been tightlipped about welfare policy ahead of the upcoming election. It is yet to indicate whether it will make changes to the disability support pension or raise the jobseeker rate. Government senators said in additional comments to the report that while they supported consideration of practical improvements to the disability support pension, ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of the social security system was a key focus. Kristin O’Connell from the Antipoverty Centre, who co-authored a joint submission to the inquiry with People with Disability Australia, called out the failure of the report to explicitly call for an increase to the “appallingly low DSP rate”. There are currently about 752,000 people in receipt of the disability support pension. Of the 96,000 people who applied in 2020-21, 59.4% were rejected.",News/Australia news,Senate inquiry calls for review of rule that excludes cancer patients from disability support pension,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/senate-inquiry-calls-for-review-of-rule-that-excludes-cancer-patients-from-disability-support-pension
2/18/2022,"The way 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva was treated by her coach after her two falls in her figure skating routine on Thursday evening was “chilling” and does not inspire any confidence in her entourage, the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach has said. In an unusually strong intervention, Bach admitted that he was shocked to see the controversial Russian Olympic Committee coach Eteri Tutberidze berate Valieva as she came off the ice, barking at her “why did you stop fighting?” even though she had been under enormous mental stress ever since her positive drugs test was revealed last week.  “I must say I was very disturbed yesterday when I watched the competition on television,” said Bach. “First in her performance, how high the pressure must have been on her. I know from my athlete time a little bit about pressure. But this pressure is beyond my imagination, in particular for a girl of 15 years old.“To see her struggling on the ice, seeing how she tries to compose herself again and finish her programme, you could see in every movement in the body language, you could feel this was an immense mental stress.“But this was not all,” Bach added. “When afterwards I saw how she was received by her closest entourage, with what appeared to be a tremendous coldness, it was chilling to see this.“Rather than giving her comfort, rather than trying to help her, you could feel this chilling atmosphere, this distance. And if you were interpreting the body language, it got even worse because there were even some dismissive gestures I saw on TV.”The gold medal was won by world champion Anna Shcherbakova, who narrowly pipped her Russian compatriot Alexandra Trusova despite a more conservative free skate routine. Both are 17 years old and also coached by Tutberidze. Afterwards Trusova was visibly upset by the judging but appeared to get little support from Tutberidze – something Bach also spotted.“I am pondering whether you could really be this cold to your athlete,” Bach said. “All of this does not give me much confidence in this closest entourage in Kamila, neither with regard in the past nor in the future.”The World Anti-Doping Agency is now investigating Valieva’s coaches, doctors and other adults around her but Bach admitted that the IOC’s options were “extremely limited”.“We are not the police,” he said. “We can not interrogate. We can not have a formal prosecution procedure and therefore we need the support of governments. We need to reinforce our efforts to speak to governments so they take disciplinary measures regarding entourages.”Valieva was allowed to compete in the women’s event after the court of arbitration for sport ruled against re-imposing a provisional suspension on her.That decision came after a week of media scrutiny that followed the news that she had tested positive for angina drug trimetazidine on 8 February, a day after she helped the ROC win the team event.However Bach accepted that Valieva was unlikely to have taken the banned drug in isolation and stressed it was of “extreme importance” that those around her be properly investigated given her age. On Saturday Tutberidze insisted that her skater was clean but accepted that the situation was “very controversial and difficult”. When asked if Tutberidze had any place in the Olympics, Bach said: “This is why we have asked for the inquiry to shed light on all this. We trust this will come to light and we will not hesitate to implement the appropriate measures. And these will be tough measures.”Bach also signalled that the IOC would look into rules regarding age limits for adult competition, as well as whether minors should face the same doping penalties as senior athletes. But he added “this needs careful deliberation”.",Sport/Sport,‘Tremendous coldness’: IOC president condemns Kamila Valieva’s entourage over skater’s treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/tremendous-coldness-ioc-president-slams-kamila-valievas-entourage-over-skaters-treatment
