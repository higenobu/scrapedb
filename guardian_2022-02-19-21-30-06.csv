2/19/2022,"Today in a nutshell: Silver for Team GB in the men’s curling and New Zealand’s second gold makes it their greatest ever Winter Olympics Next up: Women’s bobsleigh, and bronze-medal matches in women’s curling and men’s ice hockey wrap up today. Tomorrow, the final day of sport and the closing ceremony  You know what they say, you wait 70 years for a gold medal at the Winter Olympics and then two come along at once. New Zealand’s Nico Porteous won the country’s second ever gold and second gold of this Games in the men’s freeski halfpipe. Conditions were intense, with the air temperature down to -22C (-7.6F). Brrrrr. The rest of the podium was filled out with the US team – defending champion David Wise took silver and Alex Ferreira took bronze, describing the conditions as “super difficult”. “Pretty gnarly,” was the verdict of Gus Kenworthy, the 2014 silver medalist, who finished eighth. Having previously competed for the US, this year he was representing Great Britain. Drawing the curtain down on his career he revealed a T-shirt saying “Openly British”. He said: “This sport has changed my life in ways I could have never imagined. I’m gay. I felt like I didn’t fit in, in sport. To be out and proud, competing at the Olympics, and all of the opportunities that have come my way since the Olympics, I couldn’t be more thankful.” He also had a swipe at the hosts and the International Olympics Committee (IOC), saying: “It was never that I thought China couldn’t put on a good Games – I absolutely knew that they could and they have. But when there are human rights atrocities happening in the country and a poor stance on LGBTQ rights, then those things need to be taken into consideration by the IOC.” Team GB’s first medal of the Games came on the penultimate day and it was a silver for Bruce Mouat and his men’s curling team. They took Sweden to an extra end, but the Swedes had the hammer and the match ended 5-4 in their favour. They go one better than their silver in Pyeongchang. Irene Schouten of the Netherlands won her third gold and fourth medal overall from Beijing in the women’s mass start as the speed skating competition drew to a close. Bart Swings justified me bigging up Belgium’s uniforms yesterday by winning gold in the men’s mass start. We all missed the Alpine skiing mixed team parallel contest, which has been rescheduled until tomorrow thanks to the weather. It is unclear if all of the teams will be around to compete; some had planned to fly straight out of China tonight. The weather messed with the men’s mass start 50km as well; it was delayed by an hour and shortened to 30km. The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) and Norway staged a shut-out of the first six places. Alexander Bolshunov won his third gold of the Games for ROC. Teammate Ivan Yakimushkin was second, Norway picked up yet another medal with Simen Hegstad Krueger’s bronze. Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang has ordered an investigation into a Taiwanese speed skater who posted a video of herself wearing a Chinese uniform shortly before the Games began. Huang Yu-ting put the video on her Instagram page but removed it after attracting fierce online criticism in Taiwan. Taiwan is forced to compete as “Chinese Taipei” in the Olympics due to China’s dispute over its sovereignty.

But could there be a third? Brad Hall steered his four-man bobsleigh team to 0.31 seconds off Canada’s Justin Kripps’ time in the bronze medal place. Hall, Greg Cackett, Nick Gleeson and Taylor Lawrence sit in sixth position at the halfway stage, against what they say is quite an uneven playing field. “The Germans have got three sleds, three times the amount of runs to test everything and find the best way down the track, and make sure the equipment works. We’re against it, we’ve got less resources to pull upon, so we’ve just gone with what we know and we’ll see how it turns out,” Hall explained. Times are all in local Beijing time. For Sydney it is +3 hours, for London it is -8 hours, for New York it is -13 hours and San Francisco is -16 hours.

2/19/2022,"Husky-voiced soul singer James Morrison rose to fame in the mid-noughties, with his debut single, You Give Me Something, put him at the vanguard of a generation of male singer-songwriters. Raised in Rugby, Derby and Cornwall, he released his chart-topping album Undiscovered in 2006; it went on to sell 1.5m copies, and won him a Brit award. He has since released four more albums, and has two daughters with his partner, Gill. He tours his Greatest Hits album next month.  This was taken in Leicester at my cool older cousin’s house. He was looking after me and my brother and sister for the day, and as well as driving us around in his Mk1 Golf, his plan was to “get sweets, crisps and watch some films”. He sat us down in front of Alien; I loved it. I was seven! My mum would never have let me watch it. That day was fun, but life was tough when I was little. My mum and dad split up when I was four, and I lived in Rugby, which was one of the worst places I’ve ever been. There are a lot of mental health, alcohol and drug issues in my family, and from a young age I thought that was what life was. We struggled to pay the bills; Mum was always going on about the mortgage not being paid, and we never had food in the fridge. I’d often miss breakfast and lunch, and just have dinner when I got home from school. A lot of kids in the 80s and 90s had that kind of upbringing – it’s not as if I had it harder than anyone else from a single-parent family, but it wasn’t easy. When I got to about 10, I remember asking Mum, “What job do I need to do to get out of poverty?” She said I should get into graphic design, because I was good at drawing. I tried it for a bit but as soon as I picked up a guitar I binned off the art. Music was more expressive and allowed me to have an outlet for all my emotional shit. I’d actually had a guitar when I was five, but I’d smashed it up because my sister told me I was crap. This was the same sister who gave me whooping cough when I was a newborn. I am grateful for it now, because it gave me my voice, but I remember when I first started singing I hated that I sounded so husky. Mum loved music and used to be in a band. She was very bohemian and would have been a hippy if my dad had been around more to help. Instead, she had to be a bit more authoritarian, and I don’t think she liked that. I was super quiet and insecure at school, and probably a bit irritating to my mum. I reminded her of the same qualities that people held against her growing up. I was forgetful and disorganised with my thoughts, a bit of a dreamer. In the end, being a dreamer was the thing that saved me. When I was starting out, reality TV would have been the easy route to become a musician. I watched an episode of Fame Academy and thought I could sing as good as some of the contestants, so I sent a tape in. A few weeks later, the producers wrote me a letter saying they weren’t interested. “Please don’t contact us,” that sort of thing. I carried on playing gigs but I could easily have given up and got trapped in my van-cleaning job. I was a good worker, but it was disgusting tidying up after builders. I used to find a lot of horrible old pasties on the floor. Eventually I met a random guy in a pub who went on to become my manager. In a few weeks he’d got me meetings with loads of record labels. When I released my first album, the only singer-songwriters around were me, James Blunt and Paolo Nutini. It was a big time for bands like Keane, Razorlight, Snow Patrol and Scissor Sisters, and mainstream pop. I signed to Polydor, a pop label, and I worried it wasn’t the right place for my music. But I thought: screw it, I’ll go with whatever is on the table. I had to sell 100,000 albums to get my next contract to make another record. I thought: if I can do that, then I’ve made it. It went on to sell over 1m, which was pretty incredible. It was life-changing to go from having no money to having lots. It allowed me to ease the pressure off for a minute, although it still took me a while to get my confidence, and I had terrible impostor syndrome. If I went into a photoshoot, I had this paranoia that everyone would be laughing about me behind my back, saying, “Who is this lad? Who gives a fuck?” I would look at all the other musicians who had more of an attitude and for a few years I worried that people thought I was too “normal”. I didn’t have to always be so friendly all the time. It took effort. I’m quite real and make sure I never get above my station. Sometimes it does my head in to see how other people in the music industry act. I was on Jools Holland once and the singer Ray LaMontagne was performing on it, too; I was a huge fan and went up to him and told him how much I loved his voice. He looked up at me, then looked away. I was gutted. Then after I performed he came up to me and said, “You nailed it, man.” I thought: why couldn’t you have acknowledged me before then? I won’t say who it was, but I once approached a singer backstage and asked for an autograph for my daughter, and her security jumped in and said, “Not now! She’s just come off stage.” I was like… so? I don’t know what’s wrong with people. They want power and fame and don’t care how they get it. I love singing, but as soon as I get anywhere near super-confident, I’m like, nah, pull it back a bit. My girlfriend Gill is really grounded, too – if I ever come home from a gig like Bobby Big Bollocks, she’s like: never mind that, take the bins out. After my dad died [in 2010, from liver disease relating to alcoholism], it changed my brain. It made me realise that life can go by really quickly. I moved to the countryside and bought a big house with a pool in the Cotswolds, and we’ve been there ever since. I just need to be outside in order to drown out all the bullshit. When I lived in London, it was there all the time: what you look like, your followers on social media. Nature makes me forget about all that and levels me out. Apparently Kate Moss, Jamie Dornan, Sade and Lily Allen live nearby, too, but I don’t ever see them, which is a relief. I always get embarrassed when I have to meet other celebrities – just because we are both on the telly, it doesn’t mean we’ll get on. It’s taken me a long time to enjoy my job and to get out of survival mode. I’ve built my strength up, so it’s impenetrable now. Before, I wanted adulation, but now I make music for the love of being able to express myself. Singing is my superpower, and if I can make music that people will still listen to in 20 years, and they remember I wasn’t a dick – then job done.",Lifestyle/Life and style,James Morrison looks back: ‘I was paranoid everyone was laughing at me behind my back’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/19/james-morrison-looks-back-paranoid-everyone-laughing-behind-my-back
