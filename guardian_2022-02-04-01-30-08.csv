2/4/2022,"Future, the UK’s biggest magazine publisher that is home to titles from Country Life to Metal Hammer, has been forced into an embarrassing sit-down with investors after a bruising shareholder revolt in which 60% failed to support its annual pay report – including a controversial bonus scheme in which its chief executive could be awarded £40m. The board of London-listed Future has been forced to initiate a new consultation process with shareholders after failing to gain the 50% support required to pass its report on remuneration at the company’s annual general meeting on Thursday.  The level of executive pay at Future has been contentious for a number of years, with 40% of shareholders failing to back a scheme in which the boss, Zillah Byng-Thorne, could receive £40m in the coming years if the company continues to perform strongly. Byng-Thorne, who was paid £8.8m last year, has made almost £34m over the last five years as a remarkable turnaround in the company’s fortunes has paid off handsomely. The shares were down 9% after the pay revolt on Thursday, making Future the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. Future said the shareholder revolt was against the value creation plan (VCP), in which staff will share an annual pot of £95m for three years if its stock rises 10% a year from September 2020 to 2025, as well as the terms of a payout to the former financial chief Rachel Addison. While the vote is advisory and not binding – meaning the VCP which was passed by a separate vote last February cannot be unwound – the level of opposition forces the company into explaining and justifying its policies to shareholders again. “The approval of the directors’ report on remuneration did not pass,” the company said. “As a result, the board will initiate a new consultation process with shareholders regarding the matter.” There were also significant levels of voting against the reappointment of Mark Brooker, the chair of the remuneration committee, and the committee member Rob Hattrell, as shareholders vented their displeasure with the company’s decisions on pay. “The board remains of the view that the all-employee value creation plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2021 annual general meeting, incentivises and rewards the whole Future workforce and supports the long-term success of the business, and the continued creation of sustainable long-term shareholder value,” the company said. “The plan is directly aligned to shareholder interests and will only vest if the company delivers exceptional performance.”",News/Business,Country Life publisher reeling after shareholder revolt over executive pay,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/country-life-publisher-future-shareholder-revolt-executive-pay-investors-shares
2/4/2022,"The men’s FA Cup fourth round gets under way on Friday, and from Middlesbrough visiting Manchester United to Boreham Wood’s game at Bournemouth on Sunday, it is full of potential upsets. In theory this should be a normal week of preparation for the top players but when you are facing a side from a lower division things can change in training. Looking back I can see how it affected teammates I played with. Managers would often alter the side for a cup tie against a team who, on paper at least, are weaker and this could affect the squad in many ways. For a player who knows they will be given a chance to impress, it puts extra pressure on them to perform. They know it could be their one chance to prove to the manager they can be trusted more often and if they fail to seize the opportunity they might not be in the side for a long time.  Then there is the danger of regulars dropping their effort levels in training, knowing they effectively have a weekend off if they are being rested. If an individual does not operate at their usual standard on the training ground, it does not help teammates who need to be at their best at the weekend but could end up undercooked for a match that the opposition will be desperate to impress in. Squad players give it their all in training each week to ensure the regular starters are in the best condition to win, so if they are not shown the same respect when it is their time to shine, they will not be happy. It is down to the culture at the club to ensure everyone’s attitude is right throughout the season for the good of every player. It is the manager’s choice who is selected but they do need to get the balance right, especially when wanting to give squad players and youngsters a chance. The key thing for all the players is to maintain the intensity required for any fixture regardless of opposition, whether they are top of the league or struggling in the fourth tier. If a squad become complacent they are only helping their opponents, who will be desperate to knock them out. I remember losing a cup game when we did not apply ourselves throughout the buildup and therefore performed badly on the day. In those situations you can only blame yourself. We came into the tie not 100% match fit, our preparation was not at the right level and we performed poorly against a side we should have beaten. There will be a lot of external noise about the opposition and the potential for a shock. It can make a player apprehensive when they hear about the risk of failure or the prospect of 90 minutes of being kicked up in the air by an opponent. This is another reason to ensure the buildup does not change and a player carries out their usual process to prepare for a match. With the resources available to top clubs, they will be able to prepare fully for any opponent, so it should not be a case of not knowing about the skillset of the striker they are set to come up against. When I played it was possible to turn up to games against lesser sides and have no understanding of who we were facing. That can be a strength as well as a weakness, because sometimes players can be fed too much information which can overwhelm them. At Arsenal, for example, we would always focus on ourselves and what we could do as a team, with the emphasis on us performing to the best of our ability to win, regardless of the opposition. When playing away from home as the favourites in a cup tie it is important to silence the crowd early because they can make a huge difference if they are vociferous inside a tight stadium. It is imperative to start well by keeping things simple, moving the ball quickly and not reacting to any feisty tackles as opponents look to rile you. I’ve been an underdog, too, where the mantra is to get into the opposition because they will not like it – so you have to expect it. The opponents need to know you have reached a higher level for a reason. It is key to prepare for all eventualities to avoid being put off your gameplan. If you are a team that like to pass and you turn up at the ground to find the pitch is in poor condition after training all week on good surfaces, it can mean you have to adapt quickly. This is not a regular occurrence in an era when pitches are pretty good across the board but there are still underhand methods for lower-league sides to earn an advantage, such as slowing down the pitch by not watering it. The key is to know what is coming. If a team do not prepare and perform to their maximum, it is their fault and no one else’s when they become a victim of a shock.",Sport/Football,When giants fall: the dangers of playing in a cup tie you are expected to win | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/03/dangers-of-playing-in-cup-tie-you-are-expected-to-win
2/4/2022,"Standing next to the snowy Belarusian border, Vladislav Gorban showed off Ukraine’s latest defences against Russian attack. New wooden posts topped with coils of gleaming razor wire ran alongside a slush-covered road. There was a shallow defensive ditch, dug some time ago, and a yellow and blue customs post. Plus a dog, used to sniff out narcotics. Gorban, a border guard, admitted Russian tanks would be able to smash through this flimsy ensemble of barricades and continue towards Kyiv, 140 miles away. But he had a warning. “If the Russians come, they can expect a nasty surprise,” he said, hinting at the new portable anti-tank weapons sent by the UK to Ukraine’s embattled pro-western government.  He and his colleagues would try to hold off any attack using light arms, he said. They would summon help from operative reserves located in bases nearby. “We are all military-trained. We have enough weapons. Morale is high. We will defend our country,” Gorban said as a waiting truck driver stretched his legs in the cold. An arrow-straight road leads south from the border village of Novi Yarylovychi to the capital. It goes through dense pine forest. There are deer, elk and wild boar. The route offers perfect cover for the Ukrainian army to ambush and harry any trundling military columns. In Belarus, the Kremlin has brought together the largest concentration of soldiers and modern weapons since the cold war. According to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, Russia has deployed 30,000 combat troops, elite Spetsnaz units, Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 missile defence systems. It is a formidable force. The soldiers have been moved to Belarus ahead of military exercises due to begin on 10 February and to finish on 20 February. Russia’s hawkish defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, arrived in Belarus on Thursday. In total there are now 135,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s border. Experts believe these are not sufficient numbers for a full-scale invasion. But the Ukrainians worry about an operation to encircle and then overwhelm Kyiv, possibly beginning when the Russian exercises and the Beijing Winter Olympics finish in 17 days’ time. But what about the weather? Could armoured vehicles operate in the muddy conditions of spring? “This isn’t the first world war,” Gorban said, swatting aside claims by some pundits that the Russian army needs frozen ground. “The weather doesn’t make much difference. It isn’t a problem for any 21st-century tank.” Putin insists he won’t invade Ukraine. At the same time, Russia’s president has made a series of unrealistic and maximal security demands: that Nato rules out Ukrainian membership for ever and pulls out of eastern Europe. The west’s refusal to agree to these terms gives Putin a pretext for offensive military operations, couched as self-defence. In response to the unprecedented Russian military buildup, the Biden administration has decided to send more than 3,000 troops to Germany, Poland and Romania. Moscow has condemned the move as a “destructive step”. Tensions between Ukraine and Belarus are growing, too. On Thursday the Belarusian foreign ministry summoned Ukraine’s ambassador to protest at what it said was Kyiv’s use of a drone to spy on a military training facility across the border. Ukraine dismissed the accusation, widely reported by Russian state media, as provocative and false. Yet another provocation by Belarus. We categorically reject accusations that Ukraine used a UAV on its border with Belarus. We call on Minsk to refrain from playing along with Russia's destabilising activities. Calm on Ukraine-Belarus border is in the interest of the whole region Those who live in the crumbling village of Novi Yarylovychi, seem indifferent to what Boris Johnson, visiting Kyiv this week, called “a clear and present danger” posed by Russia. One shopkeeper said he saw nothing wrong with Moscow’s military exercises. “Nato does the same thing in the Baltics,” he said. Another owner of a general store, Natasha, said she wasn’t worried. “War won’t happen,” she predicted. “Why would Russia attack us”? Natasha said her sister lived across the border in Gomel, Belarus’s second city, about 25 miles up the road. “It’s a big place, very clean, with lots of monuments. Everyone there has a car,” she said. Natasha said her brother-in-law worked in Belarus’s security services. Her sister’s family lived better than she did, she said. She pointed to her clunky Ukrainian-made Stork bike, rusting and with a ponderous frame, propped up against the window. “That’s my Mercedes,” she joked. “We don’t have work here. My pension is small. In Belarus they have collective farms.” In the event of an invasion, Russian tanks would advance through Polissya, a primordial natural area of swamps, forests, grasses and lakes. It includes Chernobyl, an exclusion zone after the 1986 nuclear disaster. Forty miles south of Novi Yarylovychi is Chernihiv, an ancient city that was once part of the original Slavic dynasty known as Kievan Rus’. History is never far away. Novi Yarylovychi’s war memorial features a gold-painted Soviet soldier holding a helmet in one hand and a laurel crown in the other. Below him is a tablet with the names of those who died in the second world war. Side by side in Russian and Ukrainian are the words “never forget” and a hammer and sickle medallion. If Russia attacks from the north, Ukraine’s first tank brigade would swing into action. It is located in a former Soviet barracks close to the Belarus border and within the Mizhrichynskyi landscape park. It has a crisscross of forest tracks used for training, as well as a shooting range and box-like accommodation blocks, visible from the road. The Guardian’s scheduled visit to the base was cancelled because of a local outbreak of Covid. Security sources in Kyiv believe a similar epidemic has swept through the Russian soldiers and conscripts due to participate in next week’s Belarus exercises. It is one more variable that may affect Putin’s thinking on when – if at all – to attack. The same officials suggest that while the world has been looking anxiously at Ukraine, the Kremlin has in effect militarised and taken over Belarus. After Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014, Belarus’s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, rejected the idea of giving up his country’s sovereignty in exchange for a closer union with Russia. His calculation changed in the summer of 2020 when there were massive street protests after a rigged presidential election. Moscow offered him political support and helped to quell the demonstrations. But there was a price: the seemingly permanent occupation of Belarus by Russia’s armed forces. Lukashenko has sided with Moscow in its fight with Kyiv. He recently agreed to give Russia nearly unlimited use of four airbases, a surface-to-air missile base, and approximately 30 storage sites on Belarusian territory. Russian forces now face off against Nato on a new eastern European front, encompassing the states of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. Few believe Russia will remove its troops from Belarus once this month’s exercises are over. They look to be a permanent presence along the 600-mile border with Ukraine and a new potential attack vector. Russian forces are also stationed in Crimea, in the breakaway republic of Transnistria next to Moldova, and – covertly, Kyiv says – in separatist-held territories in the east. Back in Novi Yarylovychi, Gorban said traffic had fallen dramatically since the start of the pandemic. About 1,000 people a day used the crossing, he said, compared with 10,000 a day in the pre-Covid era. For now, the vehicles that cross drag building materials and logs rather than missiles and artillery pieces. “Putin is wrong. Ukraine and Russia are separate countries,” Gorban said, surveying a scene, for now, of calm. He added: “We were founded first. It was a Kyiv prince who went to Russia and established Moscow. Back then it was just a few bogs.”",News/World news,‘We will defend our country’: Ukraine’s border guards brace for Russian assault,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/ukraine-border-guards-brace-for-russian-assault-novi-yarylovychi
2/4/2022,"A 17-year-old girl and two men have been found guilty of the sadistic homophobic murder of a consultant psychiatrist in a city centre park. The three “tortured” Dr Gary Jenkins by kicking and punching him and stamping on his head for up to 30 minutes as he begged them to stop.  During the attack and robbery in Bute Park, Cardiff, Jenkins was subject to homophobic abuse and the three left him with his trousers pulled down. Afterwards, Dionne Timms-Williams, who was 16 at the time and had not met her fellow attackers before that night, said: “I needed that.” The prosecution said that Jason Edwards, Lee William Strickland and Timms-Williams were motivated by a combination of homophobia, greed and a liking for violence. After the verdict, a statement from Jenkins’ family said: “Gary was such a kind soul who would never hurt anyone. He was an incredibly generous and creative man who had only good intentions.“Gary’s private life being put on display through a crown court trial has only intensified the impact of this event on our family, friends and colleagues.“It has been horrible to have to listen to the details of what happened.“Gary’s untimely death has also had an impact on his patients. Gary was one of the most humane, kind, compassionate doctors one could ever come across.” The charity Stonewall expressed deep concern. Iestyn Wyn, the campaigns, policy and research manager at Stonewall Cymru, said: “Lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer people should be free to go about their lives without fear or restriction, but the tragic death of Dr Jenkins is reminder of the hate our communities face for simply existing.” Stonewall also raised concerns at the way the prosecution presented the case, telling the jury that the victim’s “sexual predilections would be his undoing” and that he was well liked despite his “lifestyle choices or peccadilloes”. Wyn said: “Remarks made during the trial have further eroded the trust that our communities have in our justice system – where four in five (81%) of LGBTQ+ people already do not report hate incidents to the police. As people across the UK mourn the heartbreaking loss of Dr Jenkins, the government must take urgent action to challenges anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes and ensure all our communities are safe and free.” Edwards, 25, Strickland, 36, and Timms-Williams pleaded guilty to manslaughter and robbery but denied murder. They also admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a man who tried to save the psychiatrist. The jury at Merthyr Tydfil crown court was told that Jenkins, a 54-year-old father of two teenage girls, had separated from his wife six years before his murder and moved back to his home city of Cardiff. He was in the park in the early hours of 20 July last year when the three, who had been drinking, pounced on him. Audio of part of the attack was picked up by a CCTV camera in a shuttered cafe. He could be heard crying out: “Please help me” and repeatedly called out: “Stop it” and “Why?” One of the men could be heard subjecting him to homophobic abuse and one urged: “Stamp on his head.” A man who tried to help described the tone as “bullying … like they were having fun, like they were right to do it, like they think it’s funny and it’s just enjoyment for them. It seemed like they were loving what they were doing.” He said Timms-Williams had seemed “evil, sadistic and weird”. Dafydd Enoch QC said the assault could be seen as “torture” because of its prolonged nature, and claimed the killers saw it as “sport”. After the attack, Edwards and Timms-Williams embraced. Strickland bought a bottle of whisky using a card stolen from Jenkins. The girl appeared cheerful, contacted her mother to say she did not need picking up and stayed the night with a friend. When he was arrested, Strickland told police he was a beggar and had taken the drug spice that night. Edwards told the police the park was “dirty”. Timms-Williams, who lived with her mother, a company director, in a village in the Vale of Glamorgan, claimed she joined in the attack because she was scared that the other two would hurt her if she didn’t. Jenkins suffered a brain injury and fractures to his face and ribs, and died 16 days later. Wales’ education minister, Jeremy Miles, expressed concern over the language used by the prosecution, tweeting: “He was not ‘undone’ by his ‘sexual proclivities’. He was brutally attacked and died. We have a long way to go.” A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said: “The only people responsible for this horrific crime were those convicted today by the jury. The suggestion that Dr Jenkins was in any way to blame is completely wrong. We apologise for inappropriate and insensitive remarks made during the opening statement.”",News/UK news,Three found guilty of murdering Cardiff doctor in homophobic attack,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/three-found-guilty-of-murdering-cardiff-doctor-gary-jenkins-in-homophobic-attack

2/4/2022,"The 1967 NFL Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys is the single most famous sporting event ever held on US soil, a statement The Fiver makes with the caveat that we don’t know what we’re talking about but have decided to run with it anyway. The match has become immortalised as the Ice Bowl, on account of temperatures being -26C, with a wind chill as low as -57. The field turned into a skating rink, the referee’s whistle stuck to his lips and several players lost toenails due to frostbite. Green Bay won, and afterwards there were snacks.  By comparison, soccer’s version of this meteorological lunacy, the semi-legendary Snow Clásico between the USMNT and Costa Rica in 2013, was positively balmy. A thick blanket of white powder covered the pitch, the lines required constant clearing, and a yellow ball was required, but while there was certainly quite a nip in the air, at least there was no sense of extremity-bothering doom. However, on Wednesday night in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the soccer world finally put on a show to rival the Ice Bowl for notoriety, when the USMNT were sent out to face Honduras in temperatures of -16C with a wind-chill factor of bloody hell. Visiting coach Hernán Gómez described the conditions as “inconceivable”, before bringing his pre-match interview to a dramatic end by stating he was off outside and may be some time. OK, what Gomez actually said was: “The game hasn’t started, but I can’t wait for it to end. Because it’s not for enjoying, it’s for suffering.” He was spot-on in that analysis, because Honduras, bedecked in tights, gloves and balaclavas, went on to lose the Human Rights World Cup qualifier 3-0, with a couple of their players substituted so they could be treated for hypothermia. USA! USA!! USA!!! head coach Gregg Berhalter insisted the game was played in a “safe environment”, which was a slightly more charitable reading than the National Weather Service’s “dangerously cold”, and ignored the fact his unoccupied keeper Matt Turner was at one point farcically reduced to warming his hands in a quarterback’s pouch. Berhalter went on to point out that fixtures in “those countries” are contested by “dehydrated” players in “unbearable humidity”, so all’s fair in love and war. You can sort of see his point, but then again this sort of sharp practice really should be beneath one of the major nations in the federation. It’s also storing up trouble for the future, and The Fiver looks forward to the USA! USA!!

2/4/2022,"Boris Johnson’s longstanding policy chief Munira Mirza has dramatically quit over the prime minister’s attempt to associate Keir Starmer with the failure to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile. In a strongly-worded resignation letter obtained by the Spectator, Mirza told Johnson: “This was not the usual cut and thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case” of child sexual abuse.  The prime minister sought to row back from the claims on Thursday, saying “a lot of people have got very hot under the collar”. Hours after Jacob Rees-Mogg said the remarks were “perfectly fair and reasonable”, Johnson said: “Let’s be absolutely clear, I’m talking not about the leader of the opposition’s personal record when he was director of public prosecutions and I totally understand that he had nothing to do personally with those decisions. “I was making a point about his responsibility for the organisation as a whole. I really do want to clarify that because it is important.” The clarification was apparently not enough to placate Mirza, however. In her resignation letter, she told him: “You tried to clarify your position today but, despite my urging, you did not apologise for the misleading impression you gave.” She told Johnson he was “a better man than many of your detractors will ever understand”, adding that it was “so desperately sad that you let yourself down by making a scurrilous accusation against the leader of the opposition”. Mirza, often seen as a proponent of Downing Street’s “war on woke”, worked with Johnson at City Hall when he was mayor of London, and he previously identified her as one of the five most inspiring women in his life. Her partner, Dougie Smith, is also a senior Tory adviser. Johnson’s former adviser Dominic Cummings claimed Mirza’s departure was, “an unmistakeable signal the bunker is collapsing and this PM is finished”. He urged ministers to show a similar “flicker of moral courage,” and resign. The controversy began on Monday, when Johnson launched an attack on Starmer during a testy Commons exchange about a damning document on alleged Covid rule-busting parties in No 10 and across Whitehall. In response to the Sue Gray inquiry, Starmer called on Tory backbenchers to “end this farce” and oust Johnson. The prime minister replied by accusing Starmer of trying to “prejudge a police inquiry”, adding that as director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013, Starmer had “spent most of his time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. Starmer later accused Johnson of “parroting the conspiracy theories of violent fascists” for political gain. A Tory MP and former chief whip, Julian Smith, also said the “smear” was “wrong and cannot be defended”. Several cabinet ministers, including Nadine Dorries and Michael Gove, have since defended the remarks, however, with the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, calling it part of the “cut and thrust” of parliamentary debate. Before prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, reminded MPs of the importance of being truthful in the House of Commons.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s policy chief quits over PM’s ‘scurrilous’ Savile remark,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/boris-johnsons-policy-chief-quits-over-pms-scurrilous-savile-remark
2/4/2022,"The actor Jo Kendall, who has died aged 81, was catapulted to fame as the only woman alongside a group of six male Cambridge University students – including John Cleese, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Bill Oddie – in a revue that wowed the critics in the West End of London and transferred to Broadway in the early 1960s. A decade later, she spoke the first words in the television soap Emmerdale Farm (now titled Emmerdale), in the role of Peggy Skilbeck, Annie Sugden’s daughter.  In 1963, Kendall – although not a Cambridge student – successfully auditioned to perform in the university’s Footlights Club revue A Clump of Plinths, staged first at the city’s Arts theatre, then the New Arts theatre in London, and directed by another Cambridge student, Humphrey Barclay. The Guardian described it as “full of high spirits and delightfully fresh, original and funny”, and devoid of the political satire of its famous predecessor Beyond the Fringe. David Hatch, later a BBC radio producer and executive, was also in the cast. Retitled Cambridge Circus, the show then transferred to the Lyric theatre, in the West End. By the time it reached Broadway in 1964, via a tour of New Zealand, Graham Chapman and Jonathan Lynn were among the septet. The New York Times, in a mixed review of the production at the Plymouth theatre, noted the male-female imbalance – Kendall herself always bemoaned the lack of opportunities for women – observing that she was “one lass with six young men” and the circus’s “glamorous ringmistress” in the opening sketch. Out of Cambridge Circus came two future “silly” TV comedies, with Cleese and Chapman going on to create Monty Python’s Flying Circus, while Oddie and Brooke-Taylor formed the Goodies. The BBC was quick to pick up on this new array of talent. Barclay, by then a radio producer, hired the cast to continue their antics in what was billed as “a new kind of laughing” for the show I’m Sorry I’ll Read That Again (1964-73). Kendall’s popular sketches with Cleese as “John and Mary” were based on a routine from Cambridge Circus in which they played a married couple in the Malaysian jungle swatting flies and talking nonsense. When the unscripted I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue began its long run as an “antidote” to panel games in 1972, Kendall appeared in the first series. In the same year, she joined the original cast of the Yorkshire-set Emmerdale Farm as Peggy, and was given the first episode’s opening line: “Matt, who’s she?” The question was directed at her husband, the farm labourer Matt Skilbeck, and referred to a woman in the distance, riding a horse and watching the cortege for the funeral of her father, Annie’s husband. The woman was Marian Wilks, daughter of the newly arrived Henry Wilks, an old friend of the matriarch Annie who helped to map out a future for her farm. They turned it into a limited company with Peggy as secretary, using her previously untapped talents to keep the books in order. The character also gave birth to the soap’s first babies, the twins Sam and Sally, in 1973. Just three months after that, Kendall decided to leave, tired of the routine. “I didn’t like waking up on a Monday and knowing what I was going to do all week,” she said. She was born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, to Martha (nee Charlton) and Bernard Robinson; her parents split up when she was a child. Jo attended Leicester Collegiate school and, on graduating from Central School of Speech and Drama in London in 1961, taught English and drama in a Cambridge secondary school. Taking the stage name Kendall, she acted with the university’s Amateur Dramatics Club in the ADC theatre, playing Desdemona in Othello (1962) and Maisie King in Expresso Bongo (1963). Barclay said she was “the obvious choice as the female component” when he was casting A Clump of Plinths. On radio, she then had a prolific 35-year career in dramas (1964-99), as well as taking over from Denise Coffey to appear, from 1977 to 1980, in the sketch series The Burkiss Way and playing Lady Cynthia Fitzmelon in The Hitch-Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (1978-80), who christens the bulldozer that knocks down Arthur Dent’s house in the first episode. She also had a 1974-75 stint as Kay Munro in the serial Waggoners’ Walk and starred as the parish council leader Mrs Roberts in the satirical soap Little Blighty on the Down (1988-92). On television, Kendall was reunited with some of her Cambridge Circus cohorts in the surreal sketch series At Last the 1948 Show (1967) and Broaden Your Mind (1968-69), and voiced the Queen in a 1980 Goodies episode. Her other roles included Anne Stanhope in The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970), Mrs Joe in The Good Companions (1980-81), a 1982-83 run as the mother of Roland Browning in Grange Hill and the spirited Aunty Maud in the children’s comedy series Marlene Marlowe Investigates (1993). Although she retired in 1999, Kendall was persuaded by the producer Barnaby Eaton-Jones to make two guest appearances, alongside Brooke-Taylor and Garden, on a 2017 stage tour of I’m Sorry I’ll Read That Again. She was unable to join a 2020 tour after suffering a stroke.

2/4/2022,"For the most part, Netflix’s top 10 makes a lot of sense. The shows and films that occupy that list tend to be big and splashy and trailed to death. Don’t Look Up is a perfect case in point. Look at the orgy of attention that film was given when it came out a few weeks ago. Look at all the fawning over the stars and the director and the themes that accompanied the release. It was genuinely inescapable.  Anyway, Don’t Look Up is currently the fourth most watched English language film on Netflix. The first is The Royal Treatment; a film with no big names, no urgent message and barely a publicity campaign. And yet in the last week of January, people around the world spent 26 and a half million minutes watching it. That’s two and a half times more than they spent watching Don’t Look Up. So what’s going on? Now, your first thought might be that The Royal Treatment is a brilliant film, and it has risen to the top because Netflix is a meritocracy. But if you think that, it’s a pretty good sign that you haven’t actually watched The Royal Treatment. Because, while it isn’t terrible, anyone who claims that The Royal Treatment is actively good probably needs to have their assets seized by the state. The Royal Treatment is a film about a hairdresser who falls in love with a prince. That’s it. She cuts hair, she meets a prince, they fall in love and then the film ends. It is absolutely rote in every conceivable way. I don’t want to make assumptions, but there is every chance that The Royal Treatment achieved its 26.5 million minutes because 160 million people watched the first minute of the film, figured out exactly how the rest of it would go and then turned it off. It’s the sort of film that can only exist because of Netflix’s ability to capture audience data. Somewhere deep in Netflix’s basement, an algorithm figured out that millions of people like aggressively inoffensive films about girls who fall in love with princes, and now this exists. Nobody wanted it, nobody expressed an interest in it, but the algorithm decided that there’d be an audience for it, and now here it is. It isn’t a terrible film by any means. Some of the performances are perfectly watchable. In particular Laura Marano, who plays the hairdresser, does an amazing job of dancing right at the very edge of parody, like she knows the film isn’t up to much and has decided to just have fun instead. In that regard, she reminded me of a young Fran Drescher, and I mean that entirely as a compliment. True, it isn’t perfect. Films like this require a moment of high emotion at the end of the second act, and the speed at which this is brushed over is a possible sign of lack of care. Another, more obvious, sign is the moment where a character receives a call on a landline, and then checks the caller ID by looking at the receiver as if it was a mobile phone, even though it’s just a plastic landline telephone receiver. But, hey, no film is perfect. Perhaps, then, the success of The Royal Treatment is yet more proof that critics and audiences have wildly different values, and something charming and populist can still be a mainstream success even if critical praise eludes it. But this doesn’t seem to be the case either, because barely anyone is talking about it. On Twitter the bulk of the scant chatter regarding The Royal Treatment concerns all the dodgy accents. If you search for the film on TikTok, which you would assume would be the home of this sort of discourse, you mainly get only filming updates from the cast. Yes, there is one video by a teenage girl absolutely losing her mind over a still of the lead characters kissing, but she alone can’t be responsible for all those millions of minutes, can she? Can she? So the mystery remains. The Royal Treatment – a bland little nothing that doesn’t exist for any clear purpose, and has failed to achieve any meaningful discussion anywhere – is still a wild, out of control success story. Maybe thousands of computers are all streaming the film, muted and on a loop, to get the views up. Or maybe I’m more out of touch than I thought. Who am I kidding, it’s the last one.",Arts/Film,The Royal Treatment: why is a bland romcom a Netflix smash hit?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/the-royal-treatment-netflix-bland-rom-com-smash-hit
