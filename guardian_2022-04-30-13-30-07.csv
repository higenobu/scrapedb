4/30/2022,"What’s been astonishing about the Australian election debates is how they have completely sidelined the terrible disasters inflicted by climate change on our country over the last few years – indeed the past few months. Right now there are residents of towns up and down the east coast whose homes have been destroyed by terrible floods – some of them twice in just a few short weeks. The Liberal National Coalition now appears to be completely divided on net zero – at a time when the UN secretary general’s high-level expert group, of which I am a member, began discussions on the best way for non-state actors to achieve net zero. The establishment of this group follows very closely on the recently concluded IPCC report that many view as the last warning we’ll get from the scientific community about the need to act before it’s too late to avoid catastrophe. As the world moves forward on climate action, the Ukraine crisis looks set to be push the world into accelerating the adoption of both renewables and hydrogen by about a decade. But here in Australia the narrative from conservatives and the gas industry is that to deal with the present energy crisis we have to expand gas and, to some extent, coal: a total nonsense. Many don’t have insurance, but even if they do, they’re wondering if rebuilding in the same place is sensible. Where do they go? What do these people think when they see the politicians out on the campaign trail arguing for more fossil fuels, more emissions? And yet the ABC’s vote compass shows that climate change is a top issue for Australians in this election. Many of the same regions were, just a few short years ago, evacuating from hellish bushfires that tore through seven million hectares, burning down homes, farms, sending species into near-extinction. Over here in the west, we have experienced record heat and unprecedented wildfires in the south-west over the last summer The Great Barrier Reef is undergoing another major bleaching episode, and scientists studying it are beside themselves with worry – and frustration at the lack of action on climate change, not least from their own government. This is Australia with just over 1.1 degrees of global warming. If all governments had climate targets matching those of Australia, we’d be heading to at least three degrees of warming, if not four. The climate change debate exploded into the Australian elections this week after Matt Canavan trashed the Morrison government’s so-called net zero target – and pushed the continued use of coal. The federal government’s net zero target is a sham. Its plan would only get emissions to 66% of what’s required, and reductions to 84% would be achieved via offsets and carbon sequestration, and as yet unheard of new tech. The rest, who knows? And what a disaster carbon sequestration has turned out to be. Australia National University’s Andrew Macintosh, a man who helped develop the system, used the word “fraud” to describe this dodgy scheme. His investigations have revealed a rort that has seen millions paid out for carbon credits for forests that have actually declined, increasing emissions – the opposite of what they’ve been credited for doing. But relying on offsets is exactly what the gas industry wants politicians to do. And it appears to be getting its way, which is not surprising, given the cash it has stumped up for political parties.Not only dodgy carbon credits, but it’s also promoting the magic technological fix of carbon capture and storage (CCS), an entirely unproven industrial application that is supposed to store carbon emissions underground so the industry can keep pumping them out. Except it isn’t. Australia has its very own poster child of CCS failure: Chevron’s Gorgon project in Western Australia. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis put it so well in releasing its investigation into the Gorgon project this week: “If Chevron, Exxon and Shell can’t get Gorgon’s carbon capture and storage to work, who can?”The project has failed to meet any of its targets, by a margin of 50%. And as IEEFA points out, offsetting its carbon dioxide target shortfall may cost Gorgon US$100-184m – but ultimately it’s the Australian taxpayer who will pay the price. Yet the government’s “low carbon emissions plan” includes funding four new CCS projects across the country, in some kind of blind allegiance to an industry dead set on destroying all of our futures. All at taxpayers’ expense, with hundreds of millions in subsidies. What’s very interesting is that those of us in the UNSG’s net zero group are getting feedback from stakeholders, globally, and we’re getting a clear message: the use of offsets must be very strictly limited. Governments – and companies – must come up with targets aligned with 1.5 degrees of warming – with no “overshoot” (warming more than 1.5 and somehow bringing it back down) and focus on the critical issue of real emission reductions. The other message we’re getting is that net zero targets for companies need to also include the emissions caused by their products – so-called “Scope 3” emissions. So the likes of Woodside Energy would be liable for the emissions caused by its export markets burning the gas it sells them. Another message is that we need a clear phase-out date for fossil fuels. We already know, for coal, that needs to be 2030 for the OECD, and gas should also be phased out on a fast track. Indeed the International Energy Agency’s net zero scenarios show Australia’s emissions from gas should be peaking by 2025, around the same time that Woodside’s Scarborough-Pluto expansion is set to take off. Scott Morrison’s attitude to this whole question is clearly seen in the little jig that he did when the company reached financial closure on the Scarborough project, huge fossil fuel emitting project for which he “could not be more thrilled”. Words fail me in responding to sentiments such as this, and the re-emergence of the destructive climate wars this week in the election campaign spearheaded by Morrison himself provide no sense of “thrill”, but one of sheer dread that this election is the last chance our political class has to reset its attitude to climate change. Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the chief executive of Climate Analytics",Opinion/Opinion,"Politicians are basking in the ‘thrill’ of fossil fuels, but this election is Australia’s last chance to reset our climate attitude | Bill Hare",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/30/politicians-are-basking-in-the-thrill-of-fossil-fuels-but-this-election-is-australias-last-chance-to-reset-our-climate-attitude
4/30/2022,"Headteacher Natalia Pałczyńska was in a state of shock after the heating and hot water at her primary school went off without warning on Wednesday. “We were completely taken aback,” she said. Unless the gas starts flowing again soon, she said, “we’ll have no choice but to close our doors until it does”. The school, in Mieśisku, a village in western Poland, was in one of about 10 administrative districts in which homes, health centres, kindergartens and local businesses – as well as thousands of residents – lost heating after Moscow halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria at 8am on Wednesday. The affected area was relatively small, and unusual in that it was solely dependent on Russia for gas. But it was seen as an indication as to what could happen on a wider scale if Moscow turned off supplies to countries far more dependent than Poland which, while it gets 40% of its gas needs from Russia, only uses gas for 9% of its energy requirements. Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister, complained of a “direct attack”, accusing Russia of “putting a pistol to our heads”, but said Poland would “manage so that the Polish people will not feel any change”, and urging Poles in a televised address: “please don’t be afraid”. But in Mieśisku at least, the fear was palpable. The phones of the mayor’s office were ringing constantly as residents called in to say they had been, as one local woman told Polish TV, “shut down by Putin”. The Kremlin said it had halted supplies because of Warsaw and Sofia’s failure to respond to its demand to pay for gas in roubles. The two EU members, which are among the most vocal supporters of a swift withdrawal from Russian gas, said they would not give in to blackmail and that the provocative step was one they could handle. But it has pushed Europe to the brink of an energy crisis, prompting a 20% increase in the already rising wholesale gas price. There is anxiety that Russia could do the same elsewhere, such as to Gazprom’s most important customer in Europe, Germany – which takes 55% of its gas from Russia and has paid it €5bn for gas and oil since the start of the Ukraine conflict – or to others, such as Italy, Finland, Croatia or Latvia, which are also heavily reliant on Moscow. Industry in Poland is putting on a brave face. “We are quite well prepared for this,” said Tomasz Zieliński, president of the board of the Polish Chamber of Chemical Industry, which represents about 13,000 businesses and more than 320,000 jobs. In his office in downtown Warsaw, he cited the fact that Poland’s gas storage facilities were 76% full, compared with an EU average of only 30% (33% in Germany). The government had spent years working with businesses to reduce their dependency on Russia, he said. In 2015 a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal was opened in the north-west port city of Świnoujście, close to the German border, capable of covering a quarter of Poland’s gas needs. It is being extended to increase intake by about 10%. Shots of its yellow, snaking pipes have frequently provided the backdrop for recent TV reports and government interviews in which attempts are made to reassure Poles. It has become something of a symbol of the nation’s hope in bezpieczeństwo energetyczne(energy security), the new buzz phrase. This autumn, the much-hailed Baltic pipeline, viewed as a response to the German-Russian Nord Steam 2 project, is scheduled to go into operation. Running from Norway through Denmark to Poland, it will be able to carry about 10 billion cubic metres of gas every year, about half of the national requirements. Another pipeline nearing completion will connect Poland to the LNG terminal in the Lithuanian port city of Klaipeda, and existing pipelines connect Poland with Germany and the Czech Republic. “Poland was not surprised by what’s happened, it was something that was always expected,” said Joanna Maćkowiak-Pandera, head of Forum Energii, an NGO spanning business, administration and science, which focuses on energy transition. She hoped it might speed up Poland’s slow decarbonisation efforts not least, she said, because “it’s now clear to most people that sales of fossil fuels have literally fuelled Russian aggression”. The image being projected by business and politics may be one of stoicism, and it has helped to unify a polarised country, but “the atmosphere is extremely nervous”, she said. Interview requests to 12 manufacturers highly reliant on gas, from glass to cardboard producers, were rejected, with one admitting the “issue is right now too delicate” to talk about. The government has downplayed Poland’s dependence on Russian coal, said Maćkowiak-Pandera, which supplements inadequate domestic supplies and is used to heat a large percentage of Polish homes. “Only recently have people become aware that it’s Russian coal that gives us our dirty air and there is a lot of pressure to stop this,” she said. “In a way, this is more significant for us than the gas issue.” She asked whether the national drive for derusyfikacja (de-Russification) would push the issue of dekarbonizacja (decarbonisation) down the agenda, further increasing the demand for coal, or – as she hoped – help to wean Poland off it. Support for phasing out Russian coal is high – 94% of citizens in a recent poll said they were ready to pay more in order to switch from Russian supplies. “But no one says how much they would be prepared to pay,” she said. Household coal prices have already risen by 300% in the past year. “So, as a consequence, we expect to see a lot of energy poverty this coming winter.” There is speculation that the frenzied effort to meet the rising demand for coal may have caused two deadly explosions last week at mines in Silesia, southern Poland, killing 18 miners, while seven others are still missing. Bernard Swolzyna, a power engineer with the progressive thinktank Instrat, said that while he could not but be shocked by the events that have driven it, “a dramatic shifting of the window of discourse is taking place in Poland right now”. The idea of “diverting from fossil fuels from Russia was until recently a fringe idea, and now it’s viewed as a baseline scenario”, he said. Poland has spent years telling its neighbours Europe must move away from Russian supplies. The word niepodleglosc (independence) has a deeply emotional meaning linked to Poland’s past under the yoke of foreign powers, most recently the Soviet Union. Nowadays it is often used in relation to the energy debate. History means that trust towards Russia was low from the outset, but everyday experience did not help. Over the past 18 years, Russian gas stopped flowing at least seven times, sometimes for a few days, once for half a year. “We were keen to be independent, for which we were sometimes accused of being Russophobe, particularly by German politicians. But this idea never flew in the financial markets, because the low price was the driving force,” Maćkowiak-Pandera said. Pawel Rozynski, an economic commentator in the conservative daily, Rzeczpospolita, said Russia was “like Pablo Escoabar”. “Gas was like our drug and turned out to be very addictive because it was cheap, efficient and more ecological than other sources of energy. Poland has been forced to get sober very fast … but we have lost a lot of time defending coal because we thought it protected our sovereignty … and one of the side-effects will be much higher energy costs.” For Wojciech Mróz, the cut is most important from a moral and ethical point of view. The 24-year-old student of spatial economics, who runs his own payment start-up, Pagaspot, has been at the forefront of efforts through a Catholic youth organisation to help some of the three million Ukrainian refugees who, border police report, have arrived in Poland since the start of the war. About 20,000-25,000 people still arrive each day, and the numbers are not expected to stop any time soon. “It’s a good thing this has happened now as it saves our government from having to take this step themselves. And even if it won’t end the war, if we had kept taking the gas, it would not have stood well next to Poland’s huge national effort to help Ukrainian refugees and to save lives,” he said. Maks De Doliwa Zieliński, 23, an economics student from Kraków, whose recent plans to take up a job with a German chemicals company in eastern Ukraine were scuppered by the war, said the situation was causing friction at home. “My father, a businessman, said we and Europe made a mistake by trusting Russia at all. We never should have.” His German mother, he said, thinks otherwise, arguing that Germany had nursed the naive hope of helping Russia move to a democracy through its close trade ties, (the Wandel durch Handel – or “change through trade” policy). “Poland was screaming at the Germans for a long time about the need to diversify, saying Russia was too unpredictable. But as we can see now, business has driven politics into a dark corner.”",News/World news,‘Gas was like our drug’: defiant Poland vows to wean itself off Russian energy ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/30/gas-was-like-our-drug-defiant-poland-vows-to-wean-itself-off-russian-energy
