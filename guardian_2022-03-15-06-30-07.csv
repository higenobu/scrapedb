3/15/2022,"Somehow the memo never reached Priti Patel. Ever since Boris Johnson asked her to be home secretary, Priti Vacant had confidently assumed the government’s default position had been to be unpleasant to foreigners. Wave machines to push back refugees trying to cross the Channel in rubber boats? That will do nicely. But since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Patel has failed to read the room. The Conservatives have now picked up the national mood of compassion for people fleeing a war zone and are falling over themselves to extend a welcome. Well, up to a point. But Vacant has remained steadfastly old school. Only refugees with close family ties to someone in the UK could apply for a visa, she insisted. That’s if they could find a visa application centre that was open. Patel had had a lot of fun opening and closing centres in Calais and Lille with no warning and watching the distress of refugees pointlessly commuting between the two cities. Eventually enough was enough, even for the most hardline Tory MPs. Their constituents were demanding the UK did more and the only concession they were getting from Patel was that refugees could fill in their visas online. Assuming they had access to the relevant documents they had probably left behind in Ukraine. And internet access. Otherwise they were screwed. It reached the point where the Home Office was considered to be a failed state in itself. No one had any confidence that Patel could organise an adequate humanitarian response and so no one even bothered to ask her. Instead, The Suspect has now handed over responsibility for immigration to Michael Gove, the levelling up minister. Not because his department is ideally suited for handling a refugee crisis, but because he is just about the only cabinet minister who can be trusted not to mess up such a sensitive, logistical problem. Or to at least give the impression of not messing it up. So it was Gove who came to the Commons to make the statement on homes for Ukraine, the government’s plan to welcome more refugees to the UK. Patel was conspicuous by her absence. Too much, even for someone as thick-skinned as her. To complete her humiliation, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, made a guest appearance even though she wouldn’t get to speak. Just to rub salt in the wounds. Johnson might just as well have done the decent thing and fired her there and then. This was death by a thousand cuts. But Gove likes nothing more than someone else’s discomfort, so he put in one of his trademark Commons performances. One that oozed self-promotion and insincerity in equal measure. This wasn’t personal. He would have been just as happy stabbing any of his cabinet colleagues in the back. So he began by praising the work of the Home Office. Patel had done such a marvellous job so far that it would have been a mistake to pile on the extra pressure of supervising the new homes for Ukraine scheme. There was only so much you could expect a totally incompetent home secretary to concentrate on. The Govester then went on to outline the details of the scheme before praising the generosity of the British people. We had taken in Jews fleeing Nazi persecution and now we would extend the same offer to the Ukrainians. Which wasn’t quite true. We had taken in the children of Jews in the late 30s. We hadn’t been quite so welcoming to adult Jewish men and women. The ability of every country to rewrite its own history is undimmed. The shadow minister for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, gave the scheme a cautious thumbs up. Though she had a few practical issues. How were Ukrainian applicants supposed to find a family to sponsor them? By advertising themselves on Twitter and Instagram? And how were traumatised women and children necessarily going to get the support they needed? Nandy had rung loads of local authorities and none of them had been contacted by the government department. Gove couldn’t conceal his irritation. He had personally spoken to every local authority 10 days ago and had thought through every possible problem that could arise. And though he couldn’t divulge any of the details he could assure everyone that it was all going to work brilliantly. There was nothing that could go wrong. Things going wrong was what happened under the Prittster. Now he was in charge, people should just shut up and bow down to his superior wisdom and intellect. And that was pretty much how the rest of the session played out. MPs from both sides would say the new scheme was a vast improvement on last week’s iteration of the government’s refugee policy – a compliment received by Gove with an oleaginous smile – only to be rebuffed when they dared question the logistics. After all, we haven’t even yet managed to properly house all the Afghan and Syrian refugees we have taken in, so why was he so certain this one was going to work? A little humility would do Gove a big favour. And what if you were a family unlucky enough to be taken in by Matt Hancock who had already signed up for the scheme. Imagine being forced to listen to the most beautiful love story ever told night after night. How you were once just a humble health secretary who just happened to fall in love with Gina. And one thing led to another and you couldn’t help breaking the rules and having a grope in your office. That almost ranks as a war crime in itself. It took Labour’s Tan Dhesi to really raise the stakes. Look, he said. This may be a bit better but we’re still well behind the rest of Europe. Hell, we were still insisting on asking for visas. This was just another legacy of the Conservatives’ hostile environment. Now the Govester lost it. The hostile environment had been something dreamed up by Labour, so there was no point in blaming the Tories for implementing it, he snapped. Theresa May and Priti Patel had never wanted anything but the best for all the immigrants they had tried to kick out of the country. It was a view.",News/World news,Gove steps in to fill empathy gap after Home Office declared failed state | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/gove-steps-in-home-office-uk-refugees
3/15/2022,"All remaining Covid travel restrictions are to be dropped across the UK from later this week, despite a concerning rise in cases and hospitalisations. Ministers approved the scrapping of passenger locator forms and the requirement for all unvaccinated arrivals to get tested, with the changes to come into force from 4am on Friday. Quarantine hotels, which have not been used since the “red list” of countries was emptied in December but have been kept on standby, will also be fully stood down from the end of March. Tory MPs and the aviation industry had put pressure on the government to make the move before April, given all domestic restrictions have already been repealed. Announcing the change, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Monday it would “mean greater freedom for travellers ahead of the Easter holidays”. The decision will be welcomed by the travel industry. On Monday, Heathrow announced that air passengers travelling through the airport will no longer be required to wear a mask from Wednesday. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic said they were also preparing to drop the requirement onboard, when flying to destinations that do not require face coverings on planes. Heathrow said it would still strongly encourage people to continue to wear masks at the airport, in recognition that the pandemic was not over, but it would no longer be a firm requirement – mirroring the practice around UK transport. BA and Virgin said rules would depend on the destinations with masks required on many routes, including to the US until at least 18 April. Virgin flights to the Caribbean from both Heathrow and Manchester will see optional mask-wearing. It comes as Britain’s Covid situation deteriorated further, with health officials concerned that the number of people being hospitalised with the virus was also growing at a fast rate. In the past week, 444,201 positive cases have been recorded – an increase of 48.1%. The number of patients admitted to hospital has also risen steeply to 10,576 in England as of 8am on 14 March – 19% up on the previous week. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson on Monday insisted there was no need for any fresh restrictions to help curb the spread of the virus. He said the prime minister was “keeping a close eye on the data” but that “at the moment, we don’t see anything nearing any of the sorts of pressures we saw at the peak of the pandemic, when such large proportions of the population weren’t vaccinated or boosted”. He added: “We obviously will always have contingency plans, but the prime minister and others have talked about how the vaccination and our therapeutics mean we will not need to return to the lockdowns of the past that saw such significant measures be necessary.” The health secretary, Sajid Javid, also said the UK was in a “very good position” given the take-up of vaccines, and that a rise in infection rates was to be expected. In a bid to appease those concerned about the dropping of border measures, he vowed: “We will continue monitoring and tracking potential new variants, and keep a reserve of measures which can be rapidly deployed if needed to keep us safe.” The Department for Transport said that the “default approach will be to use the least stringent measures” and that contingency measures “will only be implemented in extreme circumstances”. Last month, Johnson significantly loosened remaining Covid restrictions, announcing that those with the virus were no longer required to isolate and that free mass testing would end from 1 April. Self-isolation support payments were also jettisoned, while sick pay rules reverted to less generous pre-pandemic arrangements.",News/World news,UK’s Covid travel restrictions to be dropped despite rise in cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/covid-travel-restrictions-for-england-to-be-dropped-despite-rise-in-cases
3/15/2022,"The four protesters who occupied the home of a Russian oligarch in London’s Belgravia have ended their demonstration and have been arrested by police. The squatters, who said they were opposed to Vladimir Putin and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and wanted to open the mansion up for Ukrainian refugees, got into the property around 1am on Monday morning. Dozens of police including officers from the Territorial Support Group and a climbing team spent hours trying to persuade them to come down from a balcony at the front of the building. They refused police negotiators’ repeated attempts to “collect” them from the balcony using a crane, saying that they wanted to be treated in the same way as the prime minister. Referencing the “partygate” inquiry, they said they wanted to be sent a questionnaire to ascertain whether they had done anything wrong rather than being arrested. But on Monday evening they left the balcony. A spokesperson for Westminster police said: “The four people protesting on the balcony of a building in Belgrave Square have come down and been arrested. A police presence will remain at the scene.” The street had earlier been cordoned off and at least 10 police vehicles and dozens of officers were on the scene. Speaking to the PA news agency over the phone during the afternoon, one of the protesters, who refused to give his name but said he was from Lithuania, said: “All our group made peace with arrest because this was always one of the options. I’m ready to take the consequences for something I believe.” The protesters said they felt their countries were also under threat from Putin. They said they wanted to open up the mansion – which they say “has too many rooms to count”, including a cinema and a wine cellar – to Ukrainians fleeing the war, along with other refugees needing shelter. In a message to Russian oligarchs, the squatters said: “You occupy Ukraine, we occupy you.” This part of London has been nicknamed “oligarchs’ quarter” because so many wealthy Russians have bought properties in the area, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace. Deripaska is an aluminium magnate. He has called on Putin to make peace with Ukraine. He was among seven Russian oligarchs put under UK government sanctions last week. The squatters also criticised UK banks and parts of the establishment that they say have allowed oligarchs to launder their billions in London. They declined to say how they got into Deripaska’s property but said “it required climbing skills” and “squatters’ magic”. “This is not ordinary squatting, this is property liberation,” one of the squatters said. In a statement sent to the Guardian, the squatters said the invasion of Ukraine was the latest in a long line of human rights abuses by Putin’s government, including the bombing of Syria and mistreatment of LGBT people. “This mansion will serve as a centre for refugee support for Ukrainians and people of all nations and ethnicities,” they said. The squatters said they were invoking the spirit of Nestor Makhno, a Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary. They said they would not leave the property willingly and planned to barricade themselves in if police or bailiffs tried to remove them. Before the group were arrested, a Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “Police were called shortly after 01:00hrs on Monday 14 March to a residential property in Belgrave Square, SW1. Officers attended and found that a number of people had gained entry and hung banners from upstairs windows. Officers remain at the location.” This is not the first time squatters have occupied an oligarch’s London mansion. In 2017 a group occupied the mansion of Andrey Goncharenko in nearby Eaton Square, which they said they wanted to open as a homeless shelter. Goncharenko is not currently under UK government sanctions.",News/UK news,Four arrested after protest at Oleg Deripaska’s London mansion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/squatters-occupy-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-london-mansion
3/15/2022,"Burning apartment blocks across Mariupol; shattered buildings in Kharkiv. Film and photographs circulating on Monday show the brutal consequences of Russia’s onslaught in eastern Ukraine, the result of a succession of air, missile and above all artillery strikes that frequently fall on civilian targets. Russian forces are still struggling to capture more of Ukraine’s cities – but while the defending forces are stocked with shoulder-mounted anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, they do not appear to have a counter to the indiscriminate artillery shelling from which civilians are desperate to escape. Part of the problem is that the endless bombing reflects the overall superiority in numbers of the Russian forces: the Kremlin began its campaign with, on the simplest measure, more than 2.5 times the artillery that Ukraine possessed, according to figures from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). “Russian artillery and counter-battery fire still overmatches Ukrainian capability, so Ukraine will probably be on the losing side of any traditional artillery duels that it gets into,” said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. In other words, Ukraine’s forces have little hope in winning long-range shootouts. One option is for the west to upgrade its supplies of arms to give Ukraine a better chance, although it has to offer kit the defenders are familiar with. Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow with the IISS, said the US and others could supply Ukraine with more US-made AN/TPQ-36 anti-artillery radars. Such systems are designed to detect and locate hostile mortars, artillery and rocket launchers on the battlefield – and the US supplied Ukraine with at least 13 by 2019. But they are so vital to the country’s desperate defenders that the Netherlands said it would supply five more a week after the war began. “There is some circumstantial evidence that these systems have been used quite effectively judging from videos of devastated Russian battery sites and they seem to be in very high demand and operational security is very tight with little publicly available info,” Gady added. Beyond that – unless the west is willing to supply heavy guns that match Russia’s – Ukraine’s options are to either attempt high-risk raids on Russian artillery, should its forces be able to break out of the cities, or to “punch a hole in the Russian air-defence umbrella”, Gady said, by deploying more Turkish TB2 drones to attack Russian artillery in the rear. After starting the war with up to a dozen such drones, a further delivery was made at the beginning of the month. Most still remain, according to the US, but despite the propaganda value that drone-strike videos generate online, it is unclear whether the numbers available to Ukraine can turn the tide. Whatever impact western counter-artillery kit has had, it clearly has not yet been enough. A video produced by a 19-year-old from Kharkiv shows a series of shattered buildings in his local neighbourhood, including “the same five-floor building where my father grew up” and “the cinema where every week I went to see new movies with my friends and family”. Ukraine estimates that 2,500 civilians were killed during the two-week siege of Mariupol. While its forces battle to prevent Russian armour from seizing the coastal city, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that in retaliation the Russian were “wiping the city out” with their shelling. It remains the case that Ukraine’s armed forces can, to a considerable extent, negate Russia’s numerical advantage by retreating into cities. But that only sets the stage for more grisly attritional urban warfare, unless Nato members are willing to dramatically step up the arms they supply, and halt the shelling.",News/World news,Grisly urban warfare looms unless west beefs up Ukraine arms supply,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/grisly-urban-warfare-looms-unless-west-beefs-up-ukraine-arms-supply-russia
