1/27/2022,"A witness told federal prosecutors he was there when Matt Gaetz was told he had sex with a minor, The Daily Beast reported. Joe Ellicott was in the room when Joel Greenberg conveyed the information to Gaetz in a phone call in 2017. Ellicott struck a plea deal and is among several people cooperating in the sex crimes probe into Gaetz. A witness has confirmed to federal prosecutors that Rep. Matt Gaetz was informed in 2017 that he had sex with a minor, sources told The Daily Beast. In a letter obtained by The Daily Beast in April of last year, Gaetz's associate Joel Greenberg said he discovered a girl he and the congressman had engaged in ""sexual activities"" with was 17 at the time. ""Immediately I called the congressman and warned him to stay clear of this person and informed him she was underage,"" Greenberg wrote, according to the outlet. He added Gaetz was ""equally shocked and disturbed by this revelation"" and that ""there was no further contact with this individual until after her 18th birthday."" According to The Daily Beast, someone else was in the room when Greenberg called Gaetz to convey that information: Joe Ellicott, Greenberg's close friend and a former employee at the Seminole County tax office. Both men are now cooperating with federal investigators in the sex crimes probe into Gaetz. Ellicott's decision to cooperate is likely bad news for the embattled Florida congressman, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection to the sex-trafficking probe. ""After nearly a year of false rumors, not a shred of evidence has implicated Congressman Gaetz in wrongdoing,"" his chief of staff told ABC News on Wednesday. ""We remain focused on our work representing Floridians."" Among other things, Ellicott and Greenberg reportedly exchanged text messages via the encrypted messaging app Signal, in which Ellicott disclosed that a woman they both were associated with ""knew [the minor] was underage the whole time, had sex with her, and they both went to see other guys."" Greenberg pleaded guilty to sex trafficking in May and agreed to cooperate with fully with the government on other investigations. Ellicott agreed to cooperate this week and will plead guilty to two federal crimes, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and distribution of a controlled substance, in a separate case from the Gaetz investigation, ABC News reported. No charges have been brought against Gaetz. But several recent developments indicate the investigation is heating up. Among other things, Gaetz's ex-girlfriend testified before a federal grand jury earlier this month. NBC News reported that the ex, whose name Insider is withholding to protect her privacy, has been talking to prosecutors for months and was granted immunity in exchange for her testimony. NBC also said prosecutors are investigating Gaetz for three separate crimes: if he sex-trafficked the 17-year-old; if he violated the Mann Act, which prohibits the transportation of ""any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose"" across state lines; and if he obstructed justice. With respect to the obstruction probe, investigators are said to be scrutinizing a three-way call after the investigation started between Gaetz, his ex, and another woman who was cooperating with federal authorities and who was reportedly recording the phone call. NBC reported that authorities suspect Gaetz of obstructing justice during that conversation; he's denied the allegation. An attorney for Ellicott declined to comment on reporting about his client's cooperation deal. A spokesperson for Gaetz and a lawyer representing Greenberg did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1/27/2022,"Sen. Ron Johnson said it's not ""society's responsibility"" to ""take care of other people's children."" Instead, Johnson backed slashing unemployment benefits to alleviate the ongoing labor shortage. He previously said he was ""not a real fan"" of the child tax credit. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson argued against government efforts to make child care cheaper for parents during a visit on Tuesday to Kwik Trip's headquarters in La Crosse. ""People decide to have families and become parents. That's something they need to consider when they make that choice,"" Johnson told local Wisconsin TV station WKBT. ""I've never really felt it was society's responsibility to take care of other people's children."" Speaking to WKBT, Johnson said that he did not support moves by the government to help families find child care options. Instead, Johnson told the news station that he would support slashing unemployment benefits to get more people back to work and alleviate the ongoing labor shortage. He told WKBT that he would back more efforts to help people get jobs that would allow them to support their own families. Johnson has historically not been a supporter of childcare-related legislation. In May 2021, Johnson remarked on WKOW-TV that he supported slashing Wisconsin's $300 per week federal unemployment subsidy. During the interview, Johnson pushed back on a suggestion from WKOW-TV host A. J. Bayatpour that many women cannot re-enter the workforce because their wages do not cover the cost of childcare. ""Unemployment benefits are not meant to provide replacement wages. That was provided during COVID when it was nobody's fault that they were losing their job or they were being encouraged to stay home so they wouldn't spread the disease,"" Johnson said. ""Wages are set in the marketplace. Businesses pay what wages they can afford based on the competitive situation, whether it's in a restaurant, whether it's in manufacturing, where they're competing against foreign manufacturers versus domestic suppliers,"" Johnson added. ""I just have greater faith in the marketplace setting appropriate wage rates."" Johnson also admitted he was ""not a real fan"" of the child tax credit which offers parents up to $3,600 per child. ""In general, I don't like to use the tax code for either economic or social engineering. I think we do a terrible job. I prefer a tax code that was simple, that was rational, that treated all income equally,"" Johnson said in response to a question about the child tax credit. President Joe Biden conceded in January that he was ""not sure"" that he would be able to keep monthly checks to parents going due to resistance from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to the Build Back Better plan. Build Back Better is now stalled while Democratic lawmakers try to negotiate with Manchin, one of the lone holdouts against the plan, whose support is essential for them to get the bill over the finish line in the 50-50 Senate.

1/27/2022,"Two days after the first cases of an offshoot of the more transmissible Omicron variant was discovered in the U.S., 11 cases of the strain, dubbed BA.2, were reported in California on Tuesday. Two of those cases were identified in one of the state’s most populous counties, Santa Clara, according to multiple reports. It’s early days, but based on the rate of spread in countries such as Denmark and the U.K., some experts are saying that BA.2 is likely to be at least a bit more transmissible than the original Omicron (BA.1). More from Deadline Los Angeles Omicron Hospitalizations Finally Begin To Fall; New Covid Cases Down 46% In Past Two Weeks 15-Month-Old Child Dies Of Covid On Two-Year Anniversary Of First L.A. Case Elton John Postpones Dallas Shows Of Restarted Tour After Testing Positive For Covid “The consistency of BA.2 growth across several counties means that it’s more transmissible than BA.1,” wrote epidemiologist Dr. Katelyn Jetelina of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston on Tuesday. “It’s likely nothing like the huge transmissibility jump we saw from Delta to Omicron,” however. Denmark has been hardest hit by BA.2. On Monday, it accounted for nearly half of the test samples sequenced in that country. In the final week of December, according to data from Statens Serum Institut under the auspices of the Danish Ministry of Health, the subvariant accounted for 20% of all Covid cases in Denmark. By today, BA.2 accounted for more than 60% of the cases in that country, per data gathered by GISAID. GISAID That means, per Dr. Jetelina, the new version of Omicron seems to be out-competing the first in Denmark, just as that variant out-competed Delta. BA.2 earned the name stealth because officials suspect the offshoot may be harder to identify from other variants than the original Omicron, not because it evades the current testing regimes. BA.2 does not display a telltale sign in PCR tests which often indicates Omicron. While a PCR test would still come up with a general positive result, such samples would need to be genomically sequenced — a much more costly and time-consuming process that is less common — to ID the specific variant involved. The first cases of BA.2 in the U.S. were announced on Monday in Washington State. At least three cases have been found at Houston’s Methodist Hospital, where genomic sequencing is more robust than elsewhere. Great Britain, Norway, France, India, Sweden and dozens of other countries are also experiencing cases of the Omicron offshoot. “New variants will continue to evolve as long as there are large pockets of unvaccinated people,” the California Department of Public Health observed in a statement to the Mercury News. “Strengthening our protection against Covid-19 through vaccination and boosting is more important than ever.” Best of Deadline Cancellations/Renewals Scorecard: TV Shows Ended Or Continuing In 2021-22 Season What's New On HBO Max For January 2022: Day-By-Day Listings For TV Shows & Movies New On Prime Video For January 2022: Daily Listings For Streaming TV, Movies & More Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

1/27/2022,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — The U.S. government plans to capture more wild horses on federal lands this year than ever before, drawing sharp criticism from mustang advocates who hoped the Biden administration would curtail widespread gathers of thousands of horses annually across the American West. Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning, known as an ally of conservationists on several public land fronts when she was appointed in the fall, says the agency plans to permanently remove at least 19,000 horses and burros this year. That's 70% more than the previous high a year ago. Critics say it’s a continuation of a decades-old policy that kowtows to ranchers who don’t want horses competing with their cattle and sheep for limited forage on agency rangeland in 10 states. “It didn’t take long for Tracy Stone-Manning to sell out America’s wild horses,” Friends of Animals President Priscilla Feral said. In Nevada, home to about half the 86,000 horses roaming federal lands, three groups have filed a lawsuit challenging what they say is the illegal, inhumane roundup of more than 2,000 horses that's already underway near the Utah line. Of the hundreds gathered so far, 11 have died, according to the agency's website. At least one death was a colt that continued to be pursued by a low-flying helicopter driving the herd toward a holding pen even though it had a “clearly broken” leg, according to the lawsuit. It says the colt suffered for at least 29 minutes before it was euthanized. “It is more than disappointing that BLM will continue the charade that they care about wild horses,” said Laura Leigh, president of the Reno-based Wild Horse Education, one of the plaintiffs. Bureau spokesman Jason Lutterman declined to comment in an email to The Associated Press. Stone-Manning said in announcing the 2022 roundup plans earlier this month the animals' population has declined since 2020 but is still triple what the government claims the land can sustain ecologically — something horse advocates dispute. The agency permanently removed 13,666 animals from the range in 2021. The lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Reno says the agency is exaggerating drought conditions and exploiting legal loopholes with 10-year plans that combine multiple horse management areas without the necessary site-specific assessments. Meanwhile, it says taxpayers continue to finance subsidies for the livestock industry through below-market grazing fees for millions of cattle and sheep causing more ecological harm than horses. “Using drought as a fig leaf for its illegal actions, the bureau ... is depopulating the West of its wild horses and burros herd by herd and burning through taxpayer dollars with their endless roundups and holding facilities,” said Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action, lead co-plaintiff with the New York-based CANA Foundation. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association says the horse activists are threatening the future of rangeland ecosystems and the well-being of the horses themselves. “Groups who file lawsuits like this continue to prove that they’d rather draft emotional press releases than contribute to meaningful solutions,"" said Kaitlynn Glover, the association's director of natural resources. Roundups are an important part of the process of bringing the horse herds into balance with the range, she said. The agency’s 2022 strategy includes treating at least 2,300 animals with fertility control and releasing them back to public lands — an approach supported by some but not all horse advocates — to stem the growth of herds that otherwise double about every five years. That's nearly double the previous high of 1,160 in 2021, the bureau said. The agency acknowledges that, due partly to a sharp decline in demand for captured horses offered for public adoption over the past 10 years, it has been left in “the unsustainable position of gathering excess horses while its holding costs spiral upward.” The lawsuit says the environmental assessment the bureau approved in May for the Nevada roundup described plans for a series of “phased gathers to remove excess animals” over a 10-year period, not “at once.”",U.S./Associated Press,US plans more wild horse roundups this year than ever before,https://news.yahoo.com/us-plans-more-wild-horse-225437063.html
