5/17/2022,"Donald Trump Jr. slammed Biden's plans to cancel student debt in comments to The Washington Post. He said the plans will bail out those with ""worthless gender study degrees."" Republicans are ramping up criticism of debt forgiveness as Biden comes closer to making a decision. Donald Trump Jr. isn't shy about his thoughts on President Joe Biden potentially forgiving some student debt. ""Biden essentially wants blue-collar workers like truck drivers — who didn't have the luxury of going to college to get drunk for four years — to bail out a bunch of upper-middle-class kids who chose to spend tens of thousands of dollars that they didn't have on worthless gender study degrees,"" Trump told The Washington Post. According to the Post, Trump's comments came after his criticism of student-loan forgiveness during a rally for Senate candidate J.D. Vance in Ohio last month — and he joins the growing number of Republicans worried Biden might actually cancel student debt. The president recently indicated a decision on loan forgiveness will be made in the coming weeks, but it's unclear what that relief will actually look like. He said he is not considering $50,000 in debt reduction for every federal borrower, and while multiple reports have suggested the relief might be targeted to those making under $125,000, Politico reported that capping relief based on income isn't something the Education Department alone has the ability to do. Trump's concerns that student-loan relief will go to the wealthy is not only repeated by many Republican lawmakers — it's one Biden himself has shared. ""The idea that you go to Penn and you're paying a total of 70,000 bucks a year and the public should pay for that? I don't agree,"" Biden said last year. And top Republican on the House education committee Virginia Foxx said in a statement last month that ""taxpayers have been footing the student loan bill for graduate students and Ivy League lawyers to the tune of $5 billion every month while their wallets are being drained by skyrocketing inflation,"" referring to the cost of the pandemic-long pause on loan payments, now set to expire after August 31. But when it comes to who student-loan relief will benefit, and how it will impact the economy, many Democrats believe the opposite. A report from the Roosevelt Institute found that the relief would benefit low-income earners most, and while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told senators last week the impact of forgiveness still needs to be analyzed, she said it ""could be good for the economy."" For now, federal student-loan borrowers can expect relief to hit their account balances at some point this summer, and Democrats want to ensure it gets done right. Politico reported that three leading voices for debt forgiveness — Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, and Raphael Warnock — are requesting Biden to hold off on issuing an executive order on loan forgiveness until they can meet with him one last time and push him to go big on debt cancellation.

5/17/2022,"By Alexandra Ulmer (Reuters) - A former Republican minority leader of the Colorado legislature is among the recipients of a trove of sensitive voting data leaked by a county official working with an activist seeking to prove President Donald Trump's false stolen-election claims, the secretary of state's office told Reuters on Monday. The revelation indicates the breach of ballot data in Elbert County was wider than previously understood. The case, now being investigated by the Colorado secretary of state, is one of at least nine unauthorized attempts to access voting-system data around the United States, at least eight of which involved Republican officials or activists seeking evidence to delegitimize Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory. The clerk in Elbert County, Dallas Schroeder, previously testified that he copied voting data from the county's election server onto two hard drives and gave the drives to two individuals, both of them lawyers. Schroeder, responding to the investigation and a related lawsuit by the secretary of state, disclosed that one of the recipients was his own attorney, John Case, and refused to name the other lawyer. But Schroeder actually gave the data to two other lawyers, in addition to Case, according to secretary of state's spokesperson Annie Orloff. Affidavits by the two attorneys were expected to be released on Monday. One of the lawyers was Joseph Stengel, a former state lawmaker who served as Republican minority leader until he resigned in 2006. Stengel, based in Denver, is a former law partner of Case, who is representing clerk Schroeder in the state lawsuit. The other was Elbert County-based attorney Ric Morgan, who is also listed as the county's Veteran Services Officer. Reached by Reuters, Stengel declined to answer questions about his role in the voting system breach. Morgan did not respond to multiple calls and emails. Schroeder did not respond to requests for comment. He has stated in legal filings that he believed he had a ""statutory duty"" to preserve records of the 2020 election. In a statement to Reuters last week, Schroeder's lawyer, Case, said that the clerk had acted legally and argued that the information on the hard drives should be public record. The copied material includes ballot images, Case said, but ""no voter information."" He said the information could have ""immense historical value."" ""Dallas Schroeder violated no law or election rule,"" he said in the statement. Asked for a response to Case's statement, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold's office told Reuters that Schroeder had violated rules prohibiting ""unqualified individuals"" from accessing voting systems equipment. He also violated rules prohibiting the use of certain ""removable storage media,"" Griswold's office said, referring to the device Schroeder used to image the systems. Griswold's office said it was still examining the data contained on the hard drives. Schroeder has testified that he was receiving instructions on how to copy the system's data from a retired Air Force colonel and political activist, Shawn Smith, a Trump supporter bent on proving there was election fraud in 2020. Smith's organization, the U.S. Election Integrity Plan (USEIP), has been pressuring local county clerks in Colorado to investigate unfounded allegations of 2020 election fraud and to give USEIP unauthorized access to voting data to perform forensic audits, according to interviews with clerks and the Colorado County Clerks Association.

5/17/2022,"Shoppers at a Florida Walmart got a little more action than they bargained for Saturday night. A woman on an electrical shopping cart caused a major scene at the Largo store and ended up arrested, police say. According to Pinellas County court records, Asia McClendon, 29, entered the store around 6:30 p.m. on the motorized vehicle. The St. Petersburg woman then began to tear through the aisles, knock over displays and damage merchandise, according to an arrest affidavit from the Largo Police Department. When a Walmart employee asked her to leave, McLendon reportedly slapped the worker and cursed. Police say an employee followed McClendon around the store at a distance while on the phone with law enforcement. Surveillance cameras also recorded the attack. McClendon was charged with battery and disorderly conduct and booked into the Pinellas County Jail. She was later released on $750 bond. The extent of the employee’s injuries is unclear as is the amount of damage to the store.
