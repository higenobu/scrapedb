1/26/2022,"Vaccination could reduce the risk of long Covid, research by the Office for National Statistics suggests. The study, of more than 6,000 adults, found that those who were double-vaccinated had a 41% lower likelihood of self-reporting Covid symptoms 12 weeks after first testing positive.  Overall, 9.5% of the double-vaccinated group reported experiencing long Covid, defined as symptoms lasting more than four weeks, compared with 14.6% of a socio-demographically-matched group who were unvaccinated. David Strain, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school and the British Medical Association’s lead on long Covid, said the ONS findings fit with research published this week that showed low levels of certain antibodies were more common in those who developed long Covid than in patients who swiftly recovered. “We know that the vaccines trigger these immune responses,” he said. “If you approach a Covid infection with higher levels of these immunoglobulins it’s less likely to [become long Covid].” Strain added that it was reassuring that vaccination appears to mitigate the risk of long Covid. A limitation of the study was that, due to the timing of the vaccination rollout, the double-vaccinated participants were sampled at a later time point – 238 days on average – than those in the unvaccinated group. So changes in dominant Covid variants in circulation and other factors that varied over the course of the pandemic could have influenced the results. The study was also observational and, while the two groups were matched for age and other socio-economic factors, there may have been other differences between the two groups meaning the study cannot conclusively prove that vaccination caused the different rates of illness. Separately, the ONS found that differences in death rates between people from different ethnic backgrounds have persisted since the start of the vaccination programme, with the rate of death involving Covid highest for the Bangladeshi group (five times greater than the White British group for males, and 4.5 greater for females), followed by the Pakistani (3.1 for males, 2.6 for females) and Black African (2.4 for males, 1.7 for females) ethnic groups. In most cases, the different rates were explained by where people lived, social disadvantage, occupation, overall health and vaccination status. However, the Bangladeshi group and Pakistani men remained at higher risk than average even after adjusting for these factors. Previous research highlighted a gene, more common in South Asian populations, that could place this group at higher risk from Covid. Vahé Nafilyan, of the ONS, said: “Today’s analysis shows that since the vaccination programme began, the risk of Covid-19 death has continued to be higher in most ethnic minority groups than in the White British group. For the first time, we show that the lower vaccination coverage in some ethnic groups also contributes to the elevated risk of Covid-19 death, particularly in the Black African and Black Caribbean groups.”",News/Society,"Coronavirus vaccines may reduce risk of long Covid, ONS study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/26/coronavirus-vaccines-may-reduce-risk-of-long-covid-ons-study-finds
1/26/2022,"A man has been cleared of killing a suspected thief who died after he pinned him down and knelt on his back for nine minutes during a citizen’s arrest. Nathan Smith, 38, was accused of using “excessive force” as he restrained Craig Wiltshire, 43, but insisted he was only trying to hang on to him as he waited for the police to arrive.  Smith told the jury at Bristol crown court that he thought Wiltshire was faking when he twice told him he could not breathe. As he left the dock, Smith thanked the jury, which took just over four hours to clear him of manslaughter, by making a prayer sign with his hands. Wiltshire was believed to have been behind a string of thefts and break-ins in the Bristol suburb where Smith was employed as a live-in carer. The court was told that despite repeated complaints to the police, there was no active police investigation into the break-ins. The jury was shown CCTV footage of the incident in the early hours of 20 November 2019, in which Wiltshire can be heard telling Smith, “I can’t breathe,” and his captor replies, “I don’t give a fuck.” Wiltshire died two weeks later, with a postmortem giving the cause of death as cardiorespiratory arrest and brain damage. The prosecution alleged that Smith used unlawful force on Wiltshire and wanted to punish him for crimes he believed he had committed in the neighbourhood. However, Prof Jason Payne-James, a leading expert on restraint techniques, said he believed the force used was “reasonable”, arguing that while police and prison officers would have known that detaining someone in a prone position could lead to positional asphyxia, an untrained person would not have realised this. Payne-James said he believed “a perfect storm” of conditions and factors contributed to Wiltshire’s death, including his small build, an existing heart condition, the presence of the heroin substitute methadone and the sedative diazepam in his bloodstream and the fact that he was struggling. Kimberly Lock, a neighbour, had told the court that the community had been “terrorised” by the break-ins, and had extra locks fitted to her house, including a sliding bolt for her bedroom. Smith’s employer, Michael Crooks, 51, is also seen in the CCTV footage adding his weight to Wiltshire for a few minutes, while his son Ben Crooks, 27, is seen kicking the prone man twice. They have admitted common assault and will be sentenced at a later date. The jury was told to assume that Wiltshire was the man suspected of committing burglaries in the neighbourhood over the previous weeks, and that the arrest was not a case of mistaken identity. Speaking after the verdict, Det Supt James Riccio, of Avon and Somerset police, said: “This has been an extremely complex and sensitive investigation into the death of a 43-year-old man. “Members of the jury have concluded Mr Smith is not guilty of manslaughter. We respect and accept the jury’s verdict. “We recognise these legal proceedings will greatly impact the affected community and we would urge anyone with worries or concerns to speak to their neighbourhood policing team.”",News/UK news,Man cleared of killing suspected thief during citizen’s arrest in Bristol,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/26/man-cleared-manslaughter-citizens-arrest-bristol
1/26/2022,"Name: Winter Olympics condoms. Age: 34.  Status: Confusing. Why do they need condoms at the Winter Olympics? Don’t be so naive. Imagine for a moment that you are an Olympian. Wow, I’m suddenly so much sexier. That’s right. And during the Winter Olympics you’re going to live in a village populated by thousands of other sexy, hard-bodied human gods who have also spent half a decade denying themselves any pleasure at all in the pursuit of glory. Logically, how would you spend your free time there? Ah, OK, the condoms are a very good idea. Correction: they are usually a very good idea. Why not now? Oh my God, read the room. Oh, right. Covid. That’s right. The upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics will operate under some incredibly strict social distancing rules to prevent the Games from becoming an international super-spreader event. As such, athletes have been instructed to minimise hugs, high-fives and handshakes at all times. That sounds sensible. And yet journalists entering the Olympics bubble found five individually wrapped commemorative condoms in their hotel rooms. In fairness, most people can have sex without high-fiving each other. But all the other stuff that goes on, all those exchanged fluids. It’s basically a Covid breeding ground. This is an ethical nightmare. It is. Since the 1988 Seoul Games, the Olympics has made it a point of pride to promote safe sex to all visitors. The policy has become a fundamental part of the institution. But at the same time, it has a responsibility to keep people apart in the pandemic. It’s a tricky spot to be in. Luckily – or unluckily – these are not the first Olympics to be held during the Covid crisis. Last year’s delayed 2020 Games in Tokyo have already set a precedent for this exact scenario. Which was? It still dished out 160,000 free condoms to athletes, but at the same time warned them that breaching social distancing guidelines could result in disqualification or deportation. A-ha, so they were mementoes. Exactly. Everyone’s consignment of five condoms was reframed as a souvenir. That’s quite sweet. Unbelievably sweet. An athlete might not have returned home with a medal, but at least they would always have a tangible reminder of that time they could have had sex with several of the most perfect people alive, but didn’t. Isn’t that what memories are made of? I hope we never have to go through this again. Me too. Call me old-fashioned, but the Olympics simply aren’t the Olympics if none of the athletes get to cheat on their spouse with a Scandinavian triple-jumper.

1/26/2022,"Keir Starmer has called in parliament for Boris Johnson to resign immediately for misleading MPs over Downing Street parties, saying the prime minister’s continued attempts to save his career were causing “immense damage to public trust”. During a prime minister’s questions so unruly that at one point the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, warned shouting MPs that they may be removed from the Commons, Starmer said the decision of police to launch an investigation meant the weight of evidence about the parties was now clear.  While Johnson refused to discuss either the police inquiry, or the imminent civil service report on the alleged lockdown-breaching gatherings, he agreed with Starmer’s question that under the ministerial code, if it were found he had misled parliament he should resign. “I think the prime minister said yes, he agrees the code does apply to him. Therefore, if he misled parliament, he must resign,” the Labour leader told MPs. Starmer reminded Johnson of statements in the Commons in December in which the PM said Covid guidance “was followed completely in No 10”, and that he had been “repeatedly assured” there were no parties. This was clearly untrue, Starmer said, adding: “Since he acknowledges the ministerial code applies to him, will he now resign?” The inquiry, led by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, is expected to be handed to Downing Street shortly, possibly on Wednesday, and will be published soon after. Challenged by Starmer to commit to publishing it in full, Johnson gave an ambiguous answer, saying he would “do exactly what I said”. The Met police announcement on Tuesday that they would look into the claims said this had happened because there was “little ambiguity” about the possibility that Covid regulations might have been broken, Starmer said. “The police had to take a decision as to whether what they had before them was the most serious and flagrant type of breach in the rules,” he told Johnson. “Does the prime minister really not understand the damage his behaviour is doing to our country?” Johnson replied by saying he had “got all the big calls right” on Covid, dismissing Starmer’s questioning as ignoring the main issues of the day, and repeating his name-calling of the Labour leader as “Captain Hindsight”. In response, Starmer noted Johnson’s apology to the Commons a fortnight before in which the prime minister had said he had attended an event in the No 10 garden in May 2020, but had believed at the time it was a work function: “This is the guy who said in hindsight he now appreciates it was a party. We’ve discovered the real Captain Hindsight, haven’t we?” Efforts to defend the PM were doing “immense damage to public trust”, Starmer said, adding: “The police say the evidence meets the test. Frankly the public have made up their minds. They know he’s not fit for the job. How much damage are the prime minister and his cabinet prepared to do to save his skin?” Starmer continued: “We now have the shameful spectacle of the prime minister of the United Kingdom being subject to a police investigation – unable to leave the country, incapable of doing the right thing. And every day his cabinet fail to speak out, they become more and more complicit.” Johnson, who was cheered loudly by some of his backbenchers, repeated his charge that Starmer was ignoring more relevant issues, and added more personal abuse, calling him, “a lawyer, not a leader”.",News/Politics,Starmer tells Boris Johnson to resign immediately for misleading parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/26/partygate-starmer-tells-boris-johnson-to-resign-immediately-for-misleading-parliament
1/26/2022,"Kayla Levering’s twin daughters just celebrated their first birthday, a momentous milestone for a family who just survived a challenging year involving long stays in the neonatal intensive care unit: two months for one daughter, five months for the other.  It was a trying time, filled with surgeries and procedures and complications – and it was made more stressful by the pressure Levering felt to produce more breast milk for both babies. When a nutritionist finally mentioned donor milk, she felt as though a light had pierced the dark. “A godsend, really,” is Levering’s description of the donations she now receives from Mothers’ Milk Bank in Austin, Texas, where she lives. “For my girls and the rough start that they had and everything, it’s just been really great to have this option to give them the best nutritional value that I can.” Levering isn’t alone. Across North America, milk banks are seeing a surge in interest. Unfortunately, they’re also seeing a plunge in supply, which has them sounding the alarm that shortages are imminent. “​​Demand has been surging in hospitals, primarily,” said Lindsay Groff, the executive director for the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA). “At the same time, supply has dipped.” At all 31 milk banks in the US and Canada associated with HMBANA, milk donations are declining, down as much as 20% in some places. Milk bank directors say they’re not at a crisis point yet, but they will be if shortages continue. “There’s no need to panic,” Groff said. But if “you feel compelled to help someone [by donating breast milk] – now is the time. Now, now, now, we need help now.” Donated breast milk can help medically fragile infants – those that are “too small and too soon and too sick” as Kim Updegrove, executive director of Mothers’ Milk Bank at Austin, puts it – to overcome a range of potentially devastating conditions, from prematurity complications to heart and stomach problems. Necrotizing enterocolitis, an inflammation of the intestines, is a leading cause of death for premature babies, but breast milk can help prevent it. “Babies that are in the NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] do so much better if they have human milk,” O’Connor said. “They have less infections, less sepsis, less risks for retinopathy of prematurity, which is a major cause of blindness in preterm babies.” Yet at the milk bank in Austin, for example, the number of donors dropped by 30% and the quantity of milk donated fell by 20% in 2021. “We are back to a number of milk donors that we haven’t seen here in Austin since 2015,” Updegrove said. “This comes after a year of tremendous expansion of both milk donors and milk volume donations, which happened in 2020 as the pandemic gained momentum.” Early in the pandemic, milk banks saw an “almost unprecedented” level of donations, Groff said. More working parents were spending time at home, allowing to more easily nurse their children instead of giving them bottles. That helped them build their milk supply; some also kept pumping to save up milk for the return to childcare. Soon, facing full freezers, parents turned to donations. “Also, the pandemic really inspired people,” O’Connor said. “People want to be the helpers.” Now, many parents have headed back to work – and to once again saving up frozen milk for daycare. “Supply has also dipped because people are going back to work. There’s a tremendous amount of stress,” Groff said. Many workplaces are also unequipped to deal with the needs of breastfeeding parents. Many nursing parents are back to stealing away for a few minutes to pump in supply closets or empty offices. “We have the issues of employers not understanding how lactation happens and how intermittent the need to express your breast milk happens throughout the workday. And the separation of the mothers from their infants,” Updegrove said. “We’re back to ground zero, with moms back to work and us not budging the culture.” The length of the pandemic may also be wearing even on those with the best intentions. “As we enter, now, a third year of dealing with a pandemic, personal stress levels are high,” Updegrove said. “The difficulty of not knowing whether you’re going to the office tomorrow or whether school will be opened or whether daycare will be opened or whether you or your child or children will be exposed to Covid tomorrow or develop coughs for which you have to be suspicious – that’s all a really difficult way to live.” Meanwhile, the pandemic has also increased the need for donor milk. Studies have shown that contracting Covid-19 during pregnancy when you’re not vaccinated increases the chance of having a premature baby, who might then benefit from donor milk. Parents who become very ill from Covid are often unable to care for their babies or to pump milk for them. Parents might also not be able to spend as much time in NICU with their infants and with specialists because of safety precautions, making it more difficult to establish a habit of breastfeeding. “Giving birth in a pandemic is just one of the hardest, most isolating experiences. And when you’re having trouble breastfeeding your baby, it’s really hard to get access to resources that feel safe,” said Sara Muncey, parent of a 10-month-old baby. When Muncey’s daughter was born three weeks early, the NICU team said donor milk might help her gain weight. “That was my very first time having ever heard that donor milk was a thing,” she said. Muncey was able to pump successfully, but she recalled those words months later when she faced a freezer full of extra milk, looked up her local milk bank and began donating regularly in September. “I know how hard it is to become a mom during this pandemic. I know how stressful it is to feed your baby,” Muncey said. “If I can sit here in my chair and pump for 45 minutes and have extra to give a NICU mom just a little bit of a breath, like a sigh of relief, even for just a moment – of course I’m going to do that. It is my honor to be able to do that for somebody else.”",News/US news,"‘Now, now, now.

1/26/2022,"The court of appeal has ruled that the UK government acted unlawfully when it stripped a British woman of her citizenship without telling her. By a two to one majority, the justices upheld a high court ruling that the failure to notify the woman, known as D4, that her citizenship had been removed until the government was contacted by her lawyers nullified the decision.  The home secretary had argued that notification had been given to D4, who has been detained in the Roj camp in Syria since January 2019, by simply placing a note on her Home Office file, relying on regulations introduced without parliamentary approval. However, the court of appeal said the British Nationality Act 1981 required written notice to be given to someone of a decision to strip them of their citizenship and only parliament could decide to alter that requirement. Lady Justice Whipple said: “The 1981 act does not confer powers of such breadth that the home secretary can deem notice to have been given where no step at all has been taken to communicate the notice to the person concerned and the order has simply been put on the person’s Home Office file. To permit that would be to permit the statute to be subverted by secondary legislation.” The court of appeal ruling, published on Wednesday, came as the government attempts, through clause 9 of the nationality and borders bill, to remove the requirement to give notice in a wide range of circumstances, including retrospectively. The clause has prompted heavy criticism and protests outside parliament. Whipple said the purpose for requirement to give notice in the 1981 act was that “the person needs to know that a decision has been made; the person is entitled to know the reasons for that decision; and the person is put on notice of their appeal rights”. Maya Foa, the director of Reprieve, said: “Today’s decision confirms that stripping a British national of their citizenship in secret is illegal. But the government is already cynically attempting to circumvent the courts by using clause 9 of the nationality and borders bill to render this ruling moot, making a mockery of the rule of law. Ministers should change course and recognise that depriving people of their citizenship without even telling them is an affront to British principles of justice and fairness.” D4 was born in the UK in 1967 and had British nationality from birth. She also has Pakistani nationality. The decision to strip her of British citizenship was made on 27 December 2019. However, her solicitors were only informed of the decision when they wrote to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in September 2020 asking for help in repatriating her. In a dissenting opinion, Sir Geoffrey Vos, master of the rolls, said: “There is, in my view, no substantive difference between a regulation that allows valid service of a notice by sending it to an address at which it is known the person will not receive it and serving it to file.” The Home Office said it intended to seek permission to appeal from the supreme court.",News/Politics,UK unlawfully stripped woman of citizenship without telling her – court,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/26/uk-unlawfully-stripped-woman-of-citizenship-without-telling-her-court

1/26/2022,"Russia does not currently have enough troops on the border with Ukraine to carry out a full-scale military invasion and occupation of the country, according to western experts and senior officials in Kyiv. They believe a Russian attack to capture most or all of Ukraine in the near future is unlikely, despite an unprecedented buildup of about 125,000 Russian soldiers, and military exercises due to take place next month in Belarus, within striking distance of the capital.  In an article published on Monday, Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said the Kremlin has not yet amassed the several hundred thousand troops necessary for a large-scale operation, on the border and in Russian territory behind the frontline. Several elements for an invasion were missing, he argued. These include completing the formation of battalion tactical groups including tank and airborne, setting up and testing a system of wartime administration, and deploying and staffing mobile hospitals. “If Russia was conducting preparations for a large-scale invasion, it would have been much more noticeable,” Zagorodnyuk said, in a paper written with colleagues from his Kyiv thinktank, the Centre for Defence Strategies. The analysis is supported by others. Konrad Muzyka, an open source intelligence specialist and president of Rochan Consulting, estimates that 66-67 Russian battalion tactical groups, the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, are in place near the border, including 11 battalion that have moved to Belarus. Nevertheless, the US has suggested a full invasion would require at least 100 battalion, and western analysts familiar with the difficulties in holding Iraq have suggested twice that number or more would be needed to fight any counterinsurgency. That larger force could be ready “if they maintain the current pace, in two to three weeks”, Muzyka said, particularly if airborne troops were brought up closer to the border. But Muzyka is sceptical that the battalions are full strength, with an average of 800 personnel. “Satellite imagery shows that there are too few tents,” he added. If the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, wanted to target Kyiv with a lightning attack, the most direct route would be from Belarus, although any attack on the capital with more than 3 million people would risk large numbers of civilian casualties. It would, also be larger in scale than anything that Putin has attempted, or indeed Russia since the second world war. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst with the Rusi thinktank, believes it would stretch Russian logistics to their limit. “I question their ability to coordinate on this scale,” he said. Supply is a particular issue, Reynolds added. “Russian units tend to hold a large stock of supplies and ammunition, using them until they run out. It makes them dangerous at first, but as they push deeper into hostile territory, their effectiveness drops quickly,” he said. Fresh units have to come forward and take over, because there is no immediate supply capability. On the other hand, moving forces to Belarus, under the cover of the Allied Resolve joint exercises, also lengthens the territory Ukrainian forces have to defend and create openings for Russian tanks elsewhere. “They don’t have the manpower to cover it all,” Muzyka said. “It isn’t difficult to get to Kyiv. The problem is to hold territory. To control it Russia will need a lot of troops,” said Gen Sergey Krivonos, the former deputy secretary in Ukraine’s national security and defence council. He added: “Russian soldiers have been fed a lot of propaganda that doesn’t correspond to reality. They would quickly discover the population is deeply hostile. It’s an information failure.” In the face of such obstacles, military and western sources believe the Kremlin is more likely to launch a more focused attack in the east and the Donbas region, where a war between the Ukrainian army and Moscow-armed separatists has gone on for nearly eight years, with 14,000 people killed. This could be coupled with “hybrid” measures designed to demoralise the Ukrainian population such as cyber-shutdowns and attacks on critical infrastructure. The US has warned Russia is preparing a “false flag” operation inside separatist territory, which might be used as a pretext for war. A British defence minister, James Heappey, said on Tuesday that the UK had intelligence to suggest efforts were being made to prepare the ground for a possible Russian attack. “We are becoming aware of a significant number of individuals that are assessed to be associated with Russian military advance-force operations and currently located in Ukraine,” he said. The two sides face one another across a 155-mile (250km) “line of contact” around the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Last week Ukrainian military intelligence agency said since the beginning of January Moscow has supplied the separatists with additional tanks, self-propelled artillery, mortars and more than 7,000 tons of fuel. Their numbers are roughly estimated at 34,000, but reliable figures are hard to come by. The Kremlin has been actively recruiting mercenaries at centres inside the Russian Federation, the agency added. These unofficial soldiers go through “intensive training courses” before being smuggled across the Russian border to occupied Donetsk and Luhansk, it said. Russia’s armed forces have been present covertly in separatist areas since 2014, according to the Ukrainian government. They could openly enter the conflict and then attempt to break through Ukrainian lines, amid a general intensification of hostilities. Speaking privately, Ukrainian government insiders concede Moscow could easily target the port of Mariupol, which is 15 miles away from the frontline. The city is economically prosperous and home to a large metallurgical factory, the Illich iron and steelworks, named after Lenin. Expanding territory controlled by the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) would make the Russian-backed enclave more viable. Putin already effectively controls these areas and may take steps to recognise them legally or even annex them. “It would be extremely hard for Russian troops to seize major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv or Odessa. There would be enormous resistance,” one former senior Ukrainian government official said. The person added: “A takeover of Mariupol would be easier. You could do it in two days and provoke a political crisis in Kyiv.” A potential window for any offensive in the Donbas would be after 4 February, when Putin is due to attend the opening of the winter olympics in Beijing and to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The military exercises in Belarus are due to finish on 20 February, the most obvious moment for an offensive operation. Any push to seize Mariupol could be carried out under a DNR flag, allowing the Kremlin deniability. It could claim fighting was part of a “civil war” in which it was not involved. However, it also has the option of encircling the port, by landing tanks and soldiers from the Sea of Azov. Analysts agree that the situation is unpredictable, with many scenarios possible. But the consensus is Ukraine’s army consisting of 145,000 troops, according to the IISS thinktank, and 300,000 to 400,000 veterans with combat experience would offer significant resistance, even if outgunned by Russian forces with a superior air force and navy. Along the existing frontline, Ukraine has deployed surface-to-air missile systems, officials are keen to stress, and a range of anti-tank weapons, including portable US Javelins, with a range of 1.6 miles, Ukrainian-made Stugna, and thousands of NLAW (next generation light anti-tank weapons), delivered to Kyiv last week by Boris Johnson’s government. In the past week, Latvia and Lithuania, with the endorsement of the US, also dispatched Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Germany, however, has so far declined to supply Ukraine with arms, holding up potential re-export of German-made artillery from the Baltic States. Russia can deploy several thousand battle tanks and fighting vehicles, if its often cautious commanders are willing to tolerate losses in battle. Yuriy Dumansky, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s army staff, said soldiers were better prepared than in 2014, when they suffered humiliating military defeats, including in the eastern city of Ilovaisk. “They have learned how to fight. Psychologically they are much stronger,” he said. Dumansky said the Kremlin’s recently deployment of troops to Kazakhstan showed its ability to react to political events quickly and decisively. But he said he was sceptical Russia had “sufficient” soldiers for a large-scale Ukraine invasion and said a “low intensity” conflict was more probable. “It was Machiavelli who pointed out it was easy to seize territory but much harder to hold it,” he said.",News/World news,Focused Russian attack on Ukraine seen as more likely than full-scale invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/focused-russian-attack-on-ukraine-seen-as-more-likely-than-full-scale-invasion
1/26/2022,"Terry Pratchett’s estate has authorised Jack Monroe to use the “Vimes Boots Index” as the name of her new price index, which is intended to document the “insidiously creeping prices” of basic food products. The author’s daughter Rhianna Pratchett, a video games journalist, said her father would have been proud to see his work used in this way by the anti-poverty campaigner. Monroe was prompted to create her index after inflation jumped to 5.4% last week, and she found herself “infuriate[d]” that the index (the Retail Price Index) used for this calculation “grossly underestimates the real cost of inflation as it happens to people with the least”. She laid out how the prices of “value” product ranges in supermarkets had soared over the last decade – rice in her local supermarket had increased in price from 45p for a kilogram bag last year, to £1 for 500g, a 344% increase – and how the number of value products has shrunk. She was soon working with economists, charities and analysts to compile her own index.  “One,” as she wrote in the Observer, “that will document the disappearance of the budget lines and the insidiously creeping prices of the most basic versions of essential items at the supermarket” and “serve as an irrefutable snapshot of the reality experienced by millions of people”. The index, Monroe said, would be called the Vimes Boots Index – in honour of Pratchett’s creation Sam Vimes, who in the Discworld novel Men at Arms lays out the “Sam Vimes ‘Boots’ theory of socio-economic unfairness”. “The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money,” wrote Pratchett. “Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of okay for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.” The Pratchett estate has authorised the use of the name, tweeting its own Pratchett quote in support of Monroe’s campaign. “Sometimes it’s better to light a flamethrower than curse the darkness,” wrote the late Discworld author in Men at Arms. Rhianna Pratchett said: “My father used his anger about inequality, classism, xenophobia and bigotry to help power the moral core of his work. One of his most famous lightning-rods for this was Commander Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch - a cynical, but likable, man who attempts to better himself whilst railing against the injustices around him. Some of which he’s had a hand in perpetrating in the past. “Vimes’s musing on how expensive it is to be poor via the cost of boots was a razor-sharp evaluation of socio-economic unfairness. And one that’s all too pertinent today, where our most vulnerable so often bear the brunt of austerity measures and are cast adrift from protection and empathy. Whilst we don’t have Vimes any more, we do have Jack and Dad would be proud to see his work used in such a way.”",Arts/Books,Terry Pratchett estate backs Jack Monroe’s idea for ‘Vimes Boots’ poverty index,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/26/terry-pratchett-jack-monroe-vimes-boots-poverty-index
1/26/2022,"Damian Lewis has spoken publicly for the first time about the loss of his wife, Helen McCrory, who died last year from breast cancer aged 52. During an evening of poetry dedicated to McCrory at the National Theatre, Lewis paid tribute to the “one person whose thunder would absolutely not be stolen”.  The show, called A Poet For Every Day Of The Year, was based on the poet Allie Esiri’s latest anthology of the same name, and featured readings from some of McCrory’s colleagues and friends, including Simon Russell Beale, Lesley Sharp and Fay Ripley. “This evening is dedicated to her and it’s perfect, because Helen loved the National Theatre. One person whose thunder would absolutely not be stolen,” Lewis told the 900-person audience, which included the couple’s two teenage children. The actor read the evening’s final verse, the Irish poet Derek Mahon’s Everything Is Going to Be All Right. It included the lines: “There will be dying, but there is no need to go into that … The sun rises in spite of everything … Everything is going to be all right.” The event concluded with a video of McCrory reading Wild Geese by Mary Oliver at a previous year’s event, the Daily Mail reported. Other poems performed included comic verse such as Spike Milligan’s You Must Never Bath in An Irish Stew and the former poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy’s Mrs Icarus. Esiri told the audience that “learning from adversity is something many people have experienced over the past two years during the pandemic. My mantra during this difficult time has always been to tell myself ‘everything is going to be all right’.” She added: “We dedicated the evening to Helen, and Damian said a few words, but we just wanted to get on and do the show. It’s what she would have told us to do – ‘OK, enough already, get on with the show!’ She loved poetry and I think she would have been pleased to be kind of here with us. It felt right. “Damian and Helen really helped to get poetry out to people. When you are stuck at home with Covid but can’t quite take on a novel, a lot of people have been turning to poetry. Tonight we chose poems that will hopefully have chimed with people who have been going through a lot over the last two years.” As one of the UK’s leading actors, McCrory was known for her roles in Peaky Blinders, James Bond and Harry Potter. She was awarded an OBE in the 2017 new year honours for services to drama. She swore her friends to secrecy about her illness as she underwent treatment. Two days after her death in April, Lewis shared a tribute to his “beautiful and mighty wife”, recalling her “fearlessness, wit, curiosity, talent and beauty”. He wrote at the time: “She has exhorted us to be courageous and not afraid. As she said repeatedly to the children: ‘Don’t be sad, because even though I’m about to snuff it, I’ve lived the life I wanted to.’” He noted that the the funeral of Prince Philip had not eclipsed the grief for McCrory. “On a weekend when the papers, rightly, will be paying their respects to the Duke of Edinburgh, thousands of others around the world have been remembering m’duchess, my little one, royalty in her own right.”",Arts/Culture,‘Her thunder would not be stolen’: Damian Lewis speaks about loss of Helen McCrory ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/26/damian-lewis-speaks-about-loss-of-helen-mccrory
1/26/2022,"Writers often say that content dictates form. But it seems less than obvious that a bio-drama about Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover from 1970 to 2019, would feature multiple numbers from music hall and Broadway songbooks, as if the Dennis being honoured were the Potter of Pennies from Heaven. Playwright Kevin Fegan’s rationale is Skinner’s comparison of the Palace of Westminster to a music hall variety venue, and this makes surprising sense. As a parliamentary sketch writer, I was struck that, beneath Skinner’s visceral ex-miner and working-class snarling at Thatcher and Heseltine, there was a twinkle, as if he relished double acts with another big name. Skinner, 90 next month, even earned a variety bill style nickname, The Beast of Bolsover, through defences of workers and the jobless and inventive heckling of the right wings of both his own party and the one opposite.  The songs are just one of the imaginative ways in which Fegan and director Jimmy Fairhurst manage historical exposition. The 1980s are staged as a soap opera cart race (a Derby sporting challenge) between Gareth Williams’s Skinner and Lisa Allen’s Thatcher. Skinner’s Westminster endgame – he lost his “red wall” seat over Brexit (even though he supported it) and immigration (because he did) – is a joke-telling contest between Skinner and Jack Brown’s Boris Johnson. Left eloquently unsaid is that, whereas the member for Bolsover never sought more than bottom-of-the-bill of power, the other clown took over the tent. A medley of remarks that caused Skinner’s regular expulsions for “unparliamentary language” also has topical resonance when Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is enforcing verbal decorum, re-energising Skinner’s complaint that the Commons risks caring more about what members are called than calling them to account. Shows about local legends are often hagiographic but Fegan includes tragedies, dubious jokes, private and public misjudgements. The subject will surely enjoy that the actor who plays him was in the socialist pop group the Flying Pickets. Their biggest hit isn’t staged but many will leave thinking about Skinner, a true public servant who always had the lowest expenses and highest attendance rate in Westminster, “Only You.” The Palace of Varieties is at Derby theatre until 5 February.",Arts/Stage,The Palace of Varieties review – the Beast of Bolsover snarls at Thatcher and spars with Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/26/the-palace-of-varieties-review-boris-johnson-derby-theatre
1/26/2022,"Ukrainian and Russian representatives are due to meet in Paris on Wednesday, together with France and Germany, in the latest diplomatic effort to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s top official on Ukraine, Dmitry Kozak, will hold talks with Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, together with French and German officials.  Before the meeting, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow was willing to take unspecified “appropriate measures” if its security demands were not met. The US is due to give a written answer later this week. Russia wants assurances that Ukraine and Georgia will never be allowed to join Nato and has called for a pullout of Nato forces from eastern Europe, including Romania and Bulgaria, and a return to 1997 levels of deployment. Joe Biden’s US administration has dismissed the demands, which amount to a cold war-style zone of influence for Russia, as a non-starter. The White House has placed 8,500 troops on heightened alert to deploy to Nato countries in eastern Europe if necessary. On Tuesday President Biden said he would consider personal sanctions against Vladimir Putin if Russia further invaded Ukraine, as well as “enormous consequences” that would damage the Russian economy. The talks in Paris are taking place under the Normandy format, a forum set up after Russia kickstarted a separatist conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Previously they have made little progress. Moscow was not ready to include the EU and OSCE in negotiations, Lavrov said on Wednesday. On Tuesday the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Olaf Scholz, the new German chancellor, met in Berlin to coordinate their stances after reports of rifts among the allies. Macron said he was due to speak by phone with Putin on Friday to “clarify” the Russian position. He said France and Germany would never abandon dialogue with Russia, but added: “If there is aggression, there will be retaliation and the cost will be very high.” Since the autumn Russia has assembled a potential invasion force of more than 100,000 troops on the Ukraine border. It held military drills on Wednesday and moved soldiers and fighter jets to Belarus before exercises next month, within striking distance of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Interfax news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying it deployed a paratrooper unit to Belarus as well as Su-35 fighter jets as part of the Allied Resolve exercises. Separately, Russian artillery forces in their country’s southern Rostov region, which borders Ukraine, were to practise firing later on Wednesday as part of a combat readiness inspection of the southern military district, the defence ministry said. In the far north, Russian warships entered the Barents Sea to practice protecting a major shipping lane in the Arctic, the Northern Fleet said. Moscow announced sweeping naval exercises last week. Talks earlier this month between Russia and the US, Nato and OSCE ended without significant agreement. Moscow has threatened “military-technical” measures if the west fails to make concessions. Ukrainian leaders have called for calm, with the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, telling parliament on Tuesday that an invasion was not imminent. He said the Russians had yet to form a combat battle group of the sort it would need, and “as of today, there are no grounds to believe” Russia would invade imminently. “Don’t worry, sleep well,” he said. “No need to have your bags packed.” In a video address Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Russia was trying to sow panic in Ukraine. Echoing Reznikov, he said it had not massed enough troops for a large-scale offensive but made clear that did not mean it could not do so later. “The number of Russian troops gathered along the Ukrainian border and in the occupied territories of Ukraine is large. It poses a direct threat to Ukraine. However, this number is currently insufficient for a full-scale offensive against Ukraine along the entire Ukrainian border,” Kuleba said. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has expressed irritation with the US and UK decision this week to withdraw non-essential staff from their embassies in Kyiv. The move was “over-cautious and premature”, officials said.",News/World news,Ukraine and Russia to hold Paris talks in latest effort to ease tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/ukraine-and-russia-to-hold-paris-talks-in-latest-effort-to-ease-tensions
1/26/2022,"There is nothing that cannot be corrupted, nothing good that cannot be transformed into something bad. And there is no clearer example than the great climate land grab. We now know that it’s not enough to leave fossil fuels in the ground and decarbonise our economies. We’ve left it too late. To prevent no more than 1.5C of heating, we also need draw down some of the carbon already in the atmosphere.  By far the most effective means are “nature-based solutions”: using the restoration of living systems such as forests, salt marshes, peat bogs and the seafloor to extract carbon dioxide from the air and lock it up, mostly in trees or waterlogged soil and mud. Three years ago, a small group of us launched the Natural Climate Solutions campaign to draw attention to the vast potential for stalling climate breakdown and a sixth mass extinction through the mass revival of ecosystems. While it is hard to see either climate or ecological catastrophe being prevented without such large-scale rewilding, we warned that it should not be used as a substitute for decarbonising economic life, or to allow corporations to offset greenhouse gases that shouldn’t be produced in the first place. We found ourselves having to shed a large number of partner organisations because of their deals with offset companies. But our warnings, and those of many others, went unheeded. Something that should be a great force for good has turned into a corporate gold rush, trading in carbon credits. A carbon credit represents one tonne of greenhouse gases, deemed to have been avoided or removed from the atmosphere. Over the past few months, the market for these credits has boomed. There are two legitimate uses of nature-based solutions: removing historic carbon from the air, and counteracting a small residue of unavoidable emissions once we have decarbonised the rest of the economy. Instead, they are being widely used as an alternative for effective action. Rather than committing to leave fossil fuels in the ground, oil and gas firms continue to prospect for new reserves while claiming that the credits they buy have turned them “carbon neutral”. For example, Shell’s Drive Carbon Neutral scheme tells businesses that by buying fuel on its loyalty card, the “unavoidable” emissions from their fleets of vehicles can be offset “through Shell’s global portfolio of nature-based solutions projects”. It assures customers that, by joining the programme, “you don’t even have to change the way you work”. Similar claims by Shell in the Netherlands were struck down by the country’s advertising watchdog. The French company Total is hoping to develop new oilfields in Congo and off the coast of Suriname. It has sought to justify these projects with nature-based solutions: in Suriname by providing money to the government for protecting existing forests, and in Congo by planting an area of savannah with fast-growing trees. This project is extremely controversial. If the drilling goes ahead it will help to break open a region of extremely rich forests and wetlands that sits on top of the biggest peat deposit in the tropics, potentially threatening a huge natural carbon store. The rare savannah habitat the company wants to convert into plantations to produce timber and biomass has scarcely been explored by ecologists. It’s likely to harbour a far greater range of life than the exotic trees the oil company wants to plant. It is also likely to belong to local people though their customary rights, which are unrecognised in Congolese law, were not mentioned in Total’s press release about the deal. In other words, the offset project, far from compensating for the damage caused by oil drilling, could compound it. These are not the only issues. In all such cases, an extremely stable bank of carbon – the fossil fuels buried below geological strata – is being swapped for less secure stores: habitats on the Earth’s surface. Last year, forests being used as corporate offsets were incinerated by the wildfires raging across North America. It’s also hard in some cases to prove that offset money has made a real difference. For example, two of Shell’s projects have been criticised on the grounds that the forests they claim to defend may not be at risk. These schemes often rely on untestable counterfactuals: what would have happened if this money had not been spent? While there are international standards for how carbon should be counted, there is no accounting for the moral hazard of carbon offsets: the false assurance that persuades us we need not change the way we live. There is no accounting for the way companies use these projects to justify business as usual. There is no accounting for how they use this greenwashing to persuade governments not to regulate them. Nature-based solutions should help us to avoid systemic environmental collapse. Instead, they are helping to accelerate it. And then there’s a small issue of land. There is simply not enough land on Earth to soak up corporate greenhouse gas emissions. Oxfam estimates that the land required to meet carbon removal plans by businesses could amount to five times the size of India – more than the entire area of farmland on the planet. And much of it rightfully belongs to indigenous and other local people, who in many cases have not given their consent. This process has a name: carbon colonialism. During the Cop26 climate summit in November last year, the government of the Malaysian state of Sabah announced a carbon credits deal with foreign corporations covering an astonishing 2m hectares (5m acres) of forest. Indigenous people say they knew nothing about it. In Scotland, Shell is spending £5m extending the Glengarry forest. While Scotland needs more trees, it also needs a much better distribution of land. As big corporations and financiers pile into this market, land prices are rising so fast that local people, some of whom would like to run their own rewilding and reforestation projects, are being shut out. A better strategy would be to spend money on strengthening the land rights of indigenous people, who tend to be the most effective guardians of ecosystems and the carbon they contain. Where communities don’t own land, they should be funded to buy it back and restore its missing habitats. But none of these projects should be counted against the fossil fuels we should leave in the ground. Yes, we need to restore life on Earth. Yes, we need to draw down as much carbon as we can. But we cannot let this crucial tool be turned against us.
