2/26/2022,"Russian forces have tightened their stranglehold on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and carried out amphibious assaults on the country’s Sea of Azov coast in an attempt to topple the government. Almost exactly 30 years after the devastating siege of Sarajevo, another major European capital came under heavy bombardment with shells hitting apartment blocks, driving up the civilian death toll. After the second day of the invasion, it was clear that it was being fiercely resisted, but also that Russian had much more military might yet to be unleashed on its neighbour. Ukrainians prepared a last-ditch defence of their capital, with barricades, and called for civilians to arm themselves with molotov cocktails. According to US estimates, Russian has fired 200 ballistic and cruise missiles at Ukraine, mostly hitting military targets but some landing in residential areas. As human rights groups accused Russia of war crimes, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court issued a reminder he has jurisdiction to investigate atrocities committed inside Ukraine. US defence officials said that the Russian offensive was facing stiffer resistance than its commanders had anticipated. They had so far not established unchallenged air superiority, for example. But the US estimates that Moscow had only committed a third of the attacking force it had mustered around Ukraine’s borders in recent months. According to the Pentagon, 10 amphibious landing ships unloaded thousands of naval infantry to the west of Mariupol, potentially cutting off the port city. In a televised address marked by more of the extreme rhetoric that has accompanied the invasion, Vladimir Putin described the the government in Kyiv as as “terrorists” and “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video of himself and his aides outside the presidential office to counter Russian media rumours that he had fled. “We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.” Western intelligence agencies have predicted that Zelenskiy and his top officials could be targeted for assassination as Russia seeks to decapitate the country. “It’s clear the kind of vitriol coming from Russia about the Ukrainian leadership, so I think we can expect that they would be targets for Russian forces coming into the city,” one western official said. Tremors from the invasion continued to spread around the world on Friday, demonstrating the potential for the already disastrous conflict to spill over Ukraine’s borders. Nato activated its rapid response force which had been established as a contingency in the event of a serious threat on the alliance’s flank. The Kremlin also issued a direct threat to Finland and Sweden, which have been openly contemplating Nato membership as a result of the invasion. “Their accession to Nato can have detrimental consequences … and face military and political consequences,” the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said. In Kyiv, barricades went up around the city as its defenders set up positions on bridges prepared for an onslaught, more Russian troops converged on the city from three directions, and Putin urged Ukraine’s military to seize power from the elected government, and bow to his demands to disarm and rule out Nato membership. Streams of people – mostly women and children, since Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave – crossed into Hungary, Poland and Romania, with 15-hour queues reported at border points. Guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv’s central station as thousands tried to force their way on to evacuation trains. Ukrainian officials claimed nearly 3,000 Russian servicemen had been killed so far, but warned that advance enemy units had already entered the Obolonskyi district of northern Kyiv. The defence ministry advised residents to “prepare molotov cocktails”. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered “a defensive phase”. He added: “Shots and explosions are ringing out … and saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us.” In video footage thought to be from south Ukraine, near Crimea, a Ukrainian civilian was shown standing in front of an advancing Russian military convoy, in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Square in 1989, in which a lone Chinese protestor stood in front of a tank, stopping its advance. US officials estimated Russia had launched more than 200 missiles at Ukraine, including both ballistic and cruise weapons. They said most had been aimed at military targets but that some had landed in residential districts, and that it was unclear whether that was accidental or deliberate. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, issued a reminder that he had the authority to investigate war crimes inside Ukraine and Amnesty International accused the Russian military of “indiscriminate attacks” after investigating several incidents, including a missile strike on a hospital building in Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, which killed four civilians and wounded 10 more. In another sign of the war’s potential to spin out of control, two more merchant ships were hit by errant missile strikes in the Black Sea, a Japanese bulk carrier and a Moldovan chemical tanker. Zelenskiy earlier on Friday accused Europe of not being hard or quick enough in sanctioning Russia earlier, urging citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putin’s invasion. “Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,” he said. “You have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.” The Ukrainian government continued its appeals to the EU to step up its sanctions, expressing bitter disappointment that the measures taken so far had not included Russia’s exclusion from the Swift global electronic payments system. The German finance ministry said on Friday that it was open to the proposal of including Swift sanctions, while the EU and the UK moved to freeze the foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The initiative was largely symbolic, as the Russian president is not thought to have identifiable personal wealth abroad. In Kyiv, Zelenskiy said in a televised address that Putin was targeting civilian as well as military sites. “They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie; they do not distinguish in which areas to operate,” he said, vowing to continue defending his country and criticising world leaders for “watching from afar”. In Russia, thousands of people defied tough anti-protest legislation to stage anti-war rallies across the country on Thursday night. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 1,800 people in 59 cities had been detained. Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, the UK’s head of defence intelligence, released a statement to reporters about the state of the fighting in Ukraine: “Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv. Their objective is to encircle the capital, to secure control of the population and change the regime. Russia continued to conduct strikes across Ukraine. Overnight, Russia launched a concerted series of strikes on targets in Kyiv. Rocket launchers have been employed in Chernihiv and Kharkiv. Ukrainian armed forces continue to offer strong resistance, focusing on the defence of key cities throughout Ukraine.”",News/World news,Russian forces tighten hold on Kyiv in attempt to topple government,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/kyiv-attack-latest-russia-invasion-ukraine
2/26/2022,"From a distance, it feels like Oscar Piastri was destined for the pinnacle of motor-racing. “My dad’s dad and my mum’s dad, my pop and my granddad, they were both mechanics,” the 20-year-old Australian says. “And my dad – his business is a car-tuning business. So I think it was naturally running in the family.” When Piastri was six, his father Chris returned from a business trip with a remote-controlled monster truck. “I was just fanging around with that in the backyard,” he says. Remote control racing led to go-karting, which led to Formula Four, Three, Two and now, this year, a reserve driver spot with BWT Alpine in Formula One. “That [monster truck] led to the journey I have taken so far.” But for all it may seem as if Piastri was preordained for motor-racing greatness, it has taken considerable sacrifice – and millions of dollars – for that goal to be within reach for the Melbourne-born driver. And despite winning the F3 and F2 championships in consecutive seasons, the Australian has not yet made it to the heights of F1. “It has been an awesome run in the junior categories,” he says. “I think the results speak for themselves.” But in the cut-throat world of motor-racing, results alone are not enough. Ahead of the season opener next month, an F1 seat remains so near, yet so far for Piastri. The prospect of becoming the 18th Australian F1 driver in history, and joining compatriot Daniel Ricciardo on the grid, eludes him – for now. The late afternoon sun shines on Piastri as he speaks over Zoom, from a backyard in Portsea on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, at the end of his summer break. A return to Europe beckons (he is based in Oxford, England) ahead of his first year globe-trotting with the international circus that is Formula One. The Australian intends to give it his all; he is a few minutes late to the interview, having been sprinting up and down the nearby sand dunes by way of pre-season training. “I’m looking forward to the challenge,” he says. “It’s going to be a different year to what I am used to, as I won’t be doing any racing. It is a new challenge, another step towards my goal of becoming a full-time F1 driver.” F1 reserve drivers spend most of their time working with the team to support the two primary drivers: on simulators fine-tuning the car, doing testing, sometimes driving in practice sessions. But Piastri will only get an opportunity to race if one of his teammates, Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon, is sick or injured. Which means that after spending his teenage years racing as much as possible, 2022 will be an adjustment. “There’s still a lot of work I can do behind the scenes, trying to learn as much as I can about the F1 world,” he says. “How the [race] weekend works, how the season schedule works with all the flying around, getting used to different time zones and so on.” Having won F2 last year, there was nowhere for Piastri to go but up; champions are not permitted to compete again. Yet with only a handful of seats up for grabs across the 10-team, 20-driver grid, Piastri always knew that a year on the sidelines was likely. In the end, the final spot – with Alfa Romeo – was taken by Chinese driver Guanyu Zhou (despite Zhou having finished third, behind Piastri, last year). Motor-racing is not cheap. In an interview with The Age last year, Chris Piastri estimated that his family, together with sponsors and supporters, had put about $6m into Piastri’s pursuit of his F1 dream. When the driver was just 15, Piastri senior was outlaying half a million dollars as his son travelled on the international go-karting circuit. The costs only increased: $1.5m to race F3, and a similar amount for his lone season in F2. (Piastri senior is the founder of an automotive software company.) Piastri speaks openly about this substantial investment in his future. “My parents never, ever, put pressure on me from a financial point of view,” he says. “But I’m quite a realistic person. I was aware of how much money was being spent. I never felt guilty, I guess … I was extremely grateful to be given that chance, that opportunity. A lot of people in life and in racing never get that kind of opportunity. So I felt I owed it to myself, and to my parents and other people investing in me, that I should do well.” He has done exceptionally well to date. “I don’t think the pressure ever really mounted up on me, but of course there were a few moments where you go: ‘This is a lot of other people’s money. So this first reserve driver role, while I haven’t made it to my ultimate goal yet, it was quite a relief to be getting paid, to finally turn professional. “I’d be lying if I said that [$6m sum] wasn’t an extraordinary amount of money. The entry barrier to F1 is very, very high.” The corollary of the costs is that, even at the highest level, the financial backing behind a driver can be the difference between earning a seat, or not. Zhou is expected to bring Chinese commercial interest to the sport; Nikita Mazepin and Lance Stroll both race for teams bankrolled by their fathers. “This year is a tricky situation because there weren’t many seats available,” Piastri explains. “In Zhou’s case, specifically, it’s a very big commercial drawcard, for the sport, and sponsors, to have the first Chinese driver in F1. I know Zhou got quite a lot of criticism for being in F1 – and I thought that was quite unfair [Piastri has been vocal in defending Zhou]. I knew that we couldn’t bring that kind of money.” The Victorian concedes that being Australian, he could never compete with the commercial potential of a Chinese driver. Nor, says Piastri, would he want to pay to play. “I want to get to F1 purely on merit, not because we could buy myself a seat. It’s been part of the game for a long-time, but I didn’t want to get to F1 because I paid to get there. I wanted to get there because I had the results.” Most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Piastri, who turns 21 in April, is driving in F1. He will spend this year learning from Ocon and Alonso; the latter, a two-time champion, is expected to retire at the end of the season, which may leave an opening. “Working with Fernando, it’s a great privilege,” Piastri says. “Certainly I can learn a lot off him this year. I want to learn as much as I can for when it’s my turn to get in the race seat.” Piastri is also guided by his agent, Mark Webber, the Queanbeyan-born driver who collected nine F1 wins during a glittering career. In the F1 paddock, Piastri will find himself alongside a crop of talented young drivers that have considerably lowered the grid’s average age. The likes of Ocon, Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, Haas’s Mick Schumacher, McLaren’s Lando Norris, Mercedes driver George Russell and Yuki Tsunoda of Scuderia AlphaTauri are all 25 or younger. “These guys are proving that they can perform almost straight away – they’re already fighting for wins,” says Piastri. “Every time that happens, it opens the door for more young guys, such as myself.” The most prominent young star is, of course, Max Verstappen, the 24-year-old F1 champion. The Red Bull driver beat rival Lewis Hamilton to the 2021 title in controversial fashion in Abu Dhabi in December. Months on, the drama of that race still lingers – governing body the FIA recently moved aside its race director, Australian Michael Masi, in an attempt to end the furore. Piastri is diplomatic when asked about the incident. “It definitely was very hectic,” he says of the final race. “I don’t really have much of an opinion, to be honest, I think maybe the rules could have been followed a bit better. But I for one am happy that the race actually got underway again for a lap, rather than finishing under safety car. I think there would be a much more negative reaction if the world championship … was decided under safety car. There you go – I won’t say any more on that.” After the dramatic conclusion to last season, there will be much anticipation when the F1 begins in mid-March in Bahrain, before it heads to Saudi Arabia and then Melbourne, for the first-time since the pandemic began. Even on home soil, Piastri will be sitting on the sidelines. “It’s never ideal not to be racing, but it’s just the way the cards have fallen,” he says. For now, at least. “I feel like I deserve a chance in F1.”",Sport/Sport,"Australia’s next F1 star Oscar Piastri: ‘I want to get there on merit, not buy a seat’ | Kieran Pender",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/australias-next-f1-star-oscar-piastri-i-want-to-get-there-on-merit-not-buy-a-seat
2/26/2022,"BP has been warned of government “concern” about its involvement in Russia, in a telephone call between business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and the oil company’s boss Bernard Looney on Friday. Kwarteng is understood to have spoken to Looney in the light of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which has increased scrutiny on British business ties to the Kremlin and led to sanctions against Russian firms. Speaking after the call, a Whitehall source said: “BP left the meeting with no doubt about the strength of the business secretary’s concern about their commercial interest in Russia.” The British oil “supermajor” has been deeply entwined with Russia for years: it has a 22% stake in Russian state oil firm Rosneft and holds two seats on the 11-strong board of the company. Rosneft is run by Vladimir Putin’s de facto deputy, Igor Sechin, who has been nicknamed Darth Vader due to his fearsome power. The two firms operate a “strategic partnership” that sees them cooperate on research, as well as on oil and gas projects such as Taas-Yuryakh in Eastern Siberia. The arrangement is the legacy of a $55bn deal in 2013 that saw the Moscow-based firm take over BP’s joint venture, TNK-BP. In BP’s most recent set of annual results the state oil company contributed $2.7bn in underlying profit to BP’s bottom line last year, up from just $56m the year before, or just over 21% of its bumper $12.8bn profit for the year. Sources familiar with the situation said Looney and Kwarteng discussed BP’s extensive Russian interests during a call on Friday. While the UK has imposed a range of sanctions on Russian businesses, including the airline Aeroflot and banks Sberbank and VTB, partnerships involving BP and its UK rival Shell have been unaffected. BP boss Bernard Looney and his predecessor, Bob Dudley, both sit on the board of Rosneft, which is chaired by former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The relationship has long been mired in controversy: when he was boss of TNK, Dudley fled Russia in 2008 amid fears over his safety and what was described by BP as an “orchestrated campaign of harassment”. BP has already been under fire for soaring profits and dividends amid an intensifying cost of living crisis, as well as pressure to slash emissions and move away from oil and gas exploration. A spokesperson for BP declined to comment on discussions with the government.",News/Business,BP’s ties to Russia draw UK government ‘concern’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/bps-ties-to-russia-draw-uk-government-concern
2/26/2022,"It was 12.48am on Monday morning, and a fully crewed train with passengers on board was preparing to leave Sydney’s Central station, bound for Wyong on the New South Wales central coast. That’s when an order arrived for the service to be cancelled. A few minutes earlier, at 12.43am, the chief executive of Sydney Trains, Matt Longland, had ordered the immediate shutdown of the state’s entire rail network. Following a weekend of increasingly fraught negotiations with the Rail, Tram and Bus Union over planned industrial action, the senior bureaucrat’s decision would see Sydney’s entire train network closed all day Monday, leaving thousands of commuters across NSW stranded and costing the state’s economy millions of dollars. Meanwhile, the state’s transport minister, David Elliott, was at home asleep. It was only when he woke up on Monday morning that he learned about the shutdown, Elliott has insisted, despite evidence revealed in Fair Work Commission hearing transcripts showing the department had been planning for the possibility of a shutdown since at least the previous Thursday. The release of the transcripts was enough for the NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, to call for Elliott to be sacked, the first time Labor has called for a minister to lose their job since Minns took over from Jodi McKay in May last year. Minns said it was implausible to suggest Elliott had not known the shutdown was coming. “At the very least, he’s an incompetent minister, not in charge of his portfolio,” he said. And while the premier, Dominic Perrottet, insists he retains confidence in the transport minister, not all of his colleagues agree. Many were bemused by Elliott’s survival this week. “It’s a fucking debacle,” one government MP told the Guardian. “As far as a defence goes, ‘I was asleep’ has to rank quite highly in terms of pure incompetence.” It’s by no means the first time that Elliott has caused headaches for the government. In his previous role as the state’s police minister, he made headlines for telling a 17-year-old P-plater that he “worked for the cops” during a road incident in 2019; posting photographs online of himself firing two banned firearms; and defending the practice of strip-searching children as young as 12. That Elliott has managed to survive has much to do with factional convenience. A key member of the Liberal party’s centre-right faction, a demotion from cabinet would be difficult for Perrottet to achieve without setting off an unwanted internal brawl. In a government dominated by moderates and Perrottet’s right faction, Elliott’s position is important at a time when the NSW division of the Liberal party is beset by a maelstrom of factional infighting. There is also no doubt Elliott inherited a troubled portfolio. After 11 years in power the NSW government has found itself dealing with multiple transport debacles, from project delays and cracked trams to an ongoing controversy over a $40bn rail asset holding entity which saw the auditor general delay signing off on the state’s finances for months. Elliott has made no secret of his displeasure at the department’s recent history and he quickly sought to take ownership of the long-running dispute with the union after he was sworn in as minister. On Christmas Day he was quoted in a Daily Telegraph story blasting his own officials for a “ludicrous” refusal to allow transport staff to wear shorts to work and vowing to shake up the portfolio. Such confidence apparently extended to his staff. In a post on social media his chief of staff, Tanya Raffoul, wrote glowingly that Elliott was best placed to negotiate an end to the industrial dispute.. “As he turns his attention to a portfolio riddled with industrial action, delays and infrastructure issues, I’m certain that he is the only cabinet minister who could successfully tackle this portfolio,” she wrote after he was sworn in. Communications between Elliott’s staff and the department could prove crucial in who gets held accountable for Monday’s fiasco. The minister’s denial of any knowledge of the shutdown has left colleagues – and reportedly the premier himself – furious. Perrottet made his displeasure known when asked about Elliott’s decision to go to bed as the situation evolved on Sunday night. “The minister will reflect on that and realise that all ministers are available 24/7,” he said. “That’s my expectation as premier.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But it has also stretched the credulity of some government insiders, who say that it’s unlikely such a major decision would have been made without the knowledge of the minister or his office. Who knew what is now the subject of an internal investigation, due to the legislative requirement for the department to inform the minister before making substantial decisions regarding the network. In a statement to the parliament this week, Elliott conceded the department believed it had fulfilled its requirements before making the decision. “Transport considered it had discharged those obligations, however my office remained of the view until approximately 1.30am that there would be a significant disruption to services but not a total network shutdown,” he said. “What is clear is that the communication between the department and my office was not sufficiently precise.” Elliott has insisted that the 10.43pm text message from Raffoul saying he had been “briefed” does not prove he was aware of the shutdown, because it only referred to “significant interruptions”. He also appeared to goad Labor on that fact in parliament this week. When Minns first revealed the existence of the text during question time on Tuesday, Elliott challenged him to show written evidence contradicting his claim that he did not know about the closure: “I have not seen anything in writing to suggest that what I have said in the house is any different,” he said. A day later, Elliott told parliament that after a meeting with Perrottet and the NSW transport secretary, Rob Sharp, he had been told “that in future [any] significant developments in the activities of the department must be the subject of a written briefing and written endorsement”. The evidence released by the Fair Work Commission raises further questions. Affidavits filed during the tense weekend negotiations reveal that as early as Thursday last week the department had flagged the possibility of a shutdown if the industrial action went ahead. Ahead of the planned action, a risk assessment conducted by Sydney Trains completed on 16 February concluded that the “risks associated” with the union’s planned action meant the rail system would need to be shut down. While Elliott has said it was only a “contingency”, the existence of the document places further pressure on his version of events. “The transport minister needs to go, otherwise there is absolutely no accountability in the NSW government at all,” Minns said.",News/Australia news,Has the Sydney trains fiasco derailed David Elliott’s career for good?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/has-the-sydney-trains-fiasco-derailed-david-elliotts-career-for-good
2/26/2022,"If you watch politics closely, you’ll recall this moment. In 2018, Scott Morrison draped his arm around Malcolm Turnbull and declared: “This is my leader and I’m ambitious for him!” Two days later, Turnbull was out and Morrison was prime minister. That moment popped into my head this week as I watched Morrison out on the hustings in Tasmania. The more recent circumstances were quite different, but the vibe was similar. Morrison was flanked by Bridget Archer, the moderate Liberal, who has made a name for herself in Canberra by (wait for it) saying what she thinks and doing what she believes is right. A journalist asked the prime minister whether he continued to support her. If this seems like a strange question, let’s contextualise quickly. Archer was one of five MPs who torpedoed Morrison’s signature religious discrimination bill in part because the package failed to protect transgender children in religious schools. Before that, Archer also worked with the independent Helen Haines to bring on an unscheduled debate about a federal integrity commission – the anti-corruption body Morrison promised voters but failed to deliver. She’s capital-T trouble, in other words. But Morrison was having none of this naysaying. “You know, we love Bridge,” he enthused. “We really do. And I’m really pleased she’s on my team, and she’s on my team and she’s a fiery member of my team and she’s a fiery member for Bass.” But before anyone could grab a fire extinguisher, or order an “I heart Bridge” campaign T-shirt, there was a plot twist. Still in Tasmania, Morrison went on to endorse a private senator’s bill being spearheaded by Claire Chandler. Chandler, a conservative, is Archer’s Tasmanian colleague. Chandler’s bill would allow sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. Sporting codes seem either bemused or openly hostile towards this proposal. Chandler says she pursued it to save women’s sport, and because Tasmanian parents want it. If we track back to Archer and the religious discrimination proposal, she crossed the floor in an effort to protect and support trans kids because she knows they are a vulnerable cohort. She didn’t do it to be liked, or to be thanked. Archer did it because if you believe God is love, you really can’t stomach doing anything else. She told parliament she feared doing anything other than what she did would “risk lives”. In the days following her decision, there’s been gratitude. But there’s also been hostility. So Morrison’s effusive on-ground endorsement of the Chandler proposal looked pretty pointed. Almost like a prime minister’s love of “Bridge” might be a teensy bit conditional. In any case, the personalities don’t matter as much as the signal. Morrison at the moment is like a truffle-hunting dog, sniffing out his path to election victory. He has spent this past week hot on the trail of two wars: one lethal, the other cultural. Obviously, the lethal conflict is the horror playing out in Ukraine. We’ll get to that war, and its local political implications, shortly. But first, let’s consider Morrison’s experimental culture war: a war on wokeness improvised during a campaign stop in Tasmania. Ever since his religious discrimination legislation hit the fence, Morrison has been throwing red meat to the right of his party. The prime minister has to do this, because safeguarding religious freedom was what conservatives (including the prime minister himself) wanted in return for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Morrison failed to deliver. As losses go, this was a bad one. Morrison rolled out of the setback by launching a sonic boom on China. He would be more Dutton than Peter Dutton, which, let’s be honest, takes some doing. Then, more protein for conservatives the following week. This full-throated endorsement of the Chandler bill. It was a “terrific” proposal. “Claire is a champion for women’s sport and I think she’s been right to raise these issues in the way that she has,” Morrison said. “Well done, Claire.” Morrison is singularly focused shoring up his own position – and apparently reckless enough to lurch from reds under the bed to casual transphobia to land that objective. But his project is bigger than holding out any last-minute regicidal brain explosion by raging rightwingers during budget week. Morrison is very plainly on the hunt for disaffected but highly motivated voters. Perhaps it’s simplest to think of Morrison’s tactics this way. If the 2019 election was about him whispering sweet nothings in the ears of “quiet Australians”, the 2022 contest is about the prime minister picking up a loud hailer so he can be heard by the noisy folks. He’s courting a noisy, minority of voters alienated from the major parties, from government as a construct, and in some cases, from rapidly shifting societal and cultural norms. People in politics report there is a cohort of Australians right now who are riled, and emotional. Call that the legacy of the pandemic. While Australian society has moved a measurable distance in favour of inclusion and tolerance, MPs say constituents uncomfortable with the idea of people transitioning are energised and motivated by their discomfort. For some – often people who have had no lived experience of loved ones in crisis – the whole trans conversation is the practical manifestation of cultural relativism and progressivism gone mad. When hackles are raised you get othering. Tribalism. Shunning and shaming. We see similar raised hackles in the public protests against vaccination mandates – this existential sense that powerful forces have shifted a known centre of gravity in an unfavourable direction. Morrison thinks he needs to engage that cohort of voters because he can’t trust that preferences from disaffected rightwingers will flow back to the Coalition on election night. Now we need to think about Ukraine. Australians have been watching the dead-eyed Vladimir Putin creeping towards lethal aggression for some weeks now. Russia’s escalation on Thursday wasn’t a shock, but it is one thing to understand intellectually that something bad can happen and another thing to watch an invasion of another country happen on live television. It would be an understatement to say the times are deeply disconcerting. The events of this past week lay the foundations of Morrison’s khaki election. The prime minister very obviously believes the Coalition can prosper politically in this uncertainty. But to do that, Morrison has to bring that sense of threat, or dread, back home. If you watch what the prime minister is saying, you’ll already have worked out how he’s doing that. The bridge between Ukraine and Australia is China. His political messaging is happening at two levels. The big picture Morrison is painting is if Putin can do this – ignore the sovereignty of a peaceful neighbour and grab what he wants – so can the regime in Beijing. This could happen in our neighbourhood is the point. Morrison is speaking about China almost as much as he’s speaking about Ukraine at the moment. Why won’t China condemn Putin? Why is China at odds with the west? Why is China easing trade with Russia? What is China hiding? All very reasonable questions, of course. But this post-invasion posture from Morrison is also part two of the China frenzy from the week before – the wild talk of Manchurian candidates, and Anthony Albanese being Xi’s candidate to win in May. Morrison’s political objectives are blindingly obvious. What is less clear is whether his current tin hat foray can cancel out the accumulated domestic disaffection of the past 12 months. Is come to daddy an automatic vote winner for the Coalition in 2022? Our latest Guardian Essential poll suggests voters are inclined to see complexity where Morrison is intent on packaging aggressive simplicity. Morrison spent last week telling voters China was bad, and bad China wants Labor to win. Voters responded by telling the pollsters at Essential that Australia’s relationship with China was complex. Disapproval of the prime minister also ticked up, suggesting voters are now sceptical about Morrison and his relentless shtick. But that survey was taken before Russia stormed over the Ukrainian border. When it comes to fighting Australian elections in the shadow of war, or substantial geopolitical realignments, or security threats, I can tell you what recent history shows us. But I can’t yet tell you how this story ends.",News/Australia news,"From a China frenzy to casual transphobia, PM is on the hunt for disaffected but highly motivated voters | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/from-a-china-frenzy-to-casual-transphobia-pm-is-on-the-hunt-for-disaffected-but-highly-motivated-voters
2/26/2022,"Rod Sims says he was “in two minds” when he met Josh Frydenberg last year to discuss seeking another term as head of the market watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Although the verdict to go was later reported as his choice, Sims, 71, says he had gone into that chat with just a few concerns about continuing. “We talked it through and we came up with a joint view”: it was time to move on. Needing a nudge hasn’t been Sims’s style during his almost 11 years as ACCC chair, a role that officially ends 20 March. This past week, he launched a farewell tour a month early with a flurry of media interviews and a National Press Club address to highlight unfinished business. Lawyer Gina Cass-Gottlieb, Sims’s successor, will become the first woman to head Australia’s main competition regulator since the Commissioner of Trade Practices began in 1966. In the past decade, the ACCC has taken on new tasks, including monitoring electricity and gas markets, financial services, agriculture and digital platforms. That five “made a big job, a very big job”, Sims says, adding, “I love the variety. I love the complexity.” It’s a job that absorbs Sims 12 hours a day Monday to Thursday and seven to 10 hours for the other days. One measure of his term’s success is whether Australia is a more or less competitive economy than a decade ago. “It’s a very good, tricky question,” Sims says. “Certainly Australia has a lot of sectors where they’re very concentrated and because of that, we’re not very competitive,” he says. “You see that when Australian companies who’ve got a very strong position in Australia go overseas and end up making a mess of it,” says Sims. He agrees that banks often struggle while tech firms are among those more likely to be “competitively fit”. Tougher fines have been one way the ACCC has sought to encourage business behaviour that benefits consumers, with penalties soaring from $1m to as much as $50m. Breaches can climb to 10% of a firm’s turnover. The commission can’t take much credit for the introduction of new technology that has shaken up some industries, such as Uber’s entry into the taxi business, but its intervention – with strong support from Frydenberg – to take on the power of digital behemoths, such as Google and Facebook (now Meta), had a huge impact. “The 2019 digital platforms survey was a good report but I never thought it would have that level of, I guess, admiration all around the world,” Sims says, listing inquiries from US and Canada, the European Union and the UK, Indonesia and Africa. Of particular pride for Sims are the news media codes, just one of 23 key elements in the report. Forcing Google and Facebook to negotiate with media companies for use of their content has reaped more than $200m a year for publishers, Guardian Australia included. “It has, I think, meant a lot more journalists are getting hired, a lot [fewer] journalists are getting put off,” Sims says. However, while the media code has helped “even up the bargaining imbalance”, market information remains far from perfect. Most deals are three to five years, and Sims has tallied up the $200m-plus figure himself. “How do I know the numbers? Just by talking to chief executives at different times; sometimes just judging the mood, and putting some parameters around it,” he says. “[It’s] very much a personal calculation but I’m certain I’m right.” He’s less sure about why Facebook continues to resist sharing their spoils from advertising with SBS and the Conversation. That stance “is just inexplicable”, and something Treasury will look at when it reviews the code “fairly soon”, Sims says. The two publishers are “vitally important sources of news information”, and may lead to Facebook being “designated”. That outcome would require the US company to negotiate “with faith” or be put into arbitration, he says. “I don’t think there’s any threat of designation sitting over Google’s head,” Sims said. “But there is with Facebook.” For its part, Meta says it will “continue to engage with publishers” and that commercial deals were just one of the ways it “provides support” to them. In some ways, it would be handy if the ACCC earned a commission from its success. When taking on business miscreants, staff are typically paid far less – sometimes half – of what their adversaries make. Stopping the gamekeepers from joining the poachers can be a challenge. “We try to make up for that with good quality work and a lovely working environment and so far that’s sort of working,” Sims says. On other matters, the behaviour gas producers have exhibited in misleading state and federal governments over the effects of sucking up east Australian gas for LNG exports remains a sore spot. “If you’re confronted by companies wanting to invest $20bn in a project and they say they have the gas, and they say it won’t affect domestic prices, it’s just hard to say ‘no’,” Sim said. By building three of those huge LNG export trains when they had only secured enough gas for two, producers ended up more than doubling domestic gas prices. (Subsequent reports suggest the cost to the wider economy were significant.) “The companies are also liable because some of their executives told governments that domestic prices wouldn’t increase,” Sims says. “That was clearly wrong.” More lately, ACCC reports have called for additional onshore gas production, arguing extra supply would push down prices. That’s because once the LNG export plants are at capacity, producers can’t export more and “the link with the overseas markets is broken”, he says. Sims doesn’t intend to fade into the regulatory sunset. He plans to write “a decent article” about the news media bargaining codes, and “think about international issues facing antitrust”. He also has links to a London-based competition policy research network, for which he will chair its steering committee, and he’s hoping to land a university perch in Australia, although nothing is settled. There might even be spare time to cheer on his AFL team Hawthorn and catch up with friends. “It would be nice not to have me working so many hours,” Sims says. “So if somebody says ‘come for a visit’, you actually can.”",News/Australia news,Reining in the digital giants: Rod Sims on the trials and triumphs of a decade as head of the consumer watchdog ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/reining-in-the-digital-giants-rod-sims-on-the-trials-and-triumphs-of-a-decade-as-head-of-the-consumer-watchdog
2/26/2022,"Victorians have poured a record amount of money into poker machines since Covid-19 restrictions lifted, losing $251m in December last year – the highest monthly loss in the state since records began. It surpassed the previous record set in ​​December 2008, when $250m was lost to electronic gaming machines (EGMs) after the first wave of stimulus payments as part of the federal government’s response to the global financial crisis. Pokies losses data released by the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) on Friday revealed the state’s residents lost another $224m using EGMs in January, despite the havoc that record high Covid infections wreaked on the hospitality industry that month. The worst losses were concentrated in areas ranked as most disadvantaged, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ index of relative socio-economic disadvantage (IRSD), which calculates disadvantage based on factors including employment and income levels, and access to education and services. Losses were highest in Brimbank, which is Melbourne’s second-most disadvantaged LGA and the third-most disadvantaged in the state. Over November, December and January, $42m was lost to pokies in Brimbank, with almost $15m lost in December alone. At the time of the last Census, the median household income for Brimbank residents was $487 a week for an individual and $1,263 a week for a household – significantly below the state median incomes of $644 and $1,419 respectively. Brimbank has also been hit hardest by the state’s Omicron wave, reporting the highest number and rate of deaths from Covid in the state since December. Just five of the 79 local government areas in Victoria that contain poker machines accounted for more than a quarter (25.81%) of the state’s pokies losses in the past three months. Those five LGAs – Brimbank, Hume, Greater Dandenong, Whittlesea and Casey – are some of the most disadvantaged, with Greater Dandenong ranked second-most disadvantaged in the state overall. Losses in Casey between November and January tallied $37.9m. In Hume, $34.8m was lost. In Greater Dandenong, $34.7m was lost. Whittlesea’s losses added up to $33.7m. Gambling reform advocates estimate that about 40% of losses from EGMs come from high-risk gamblers, which means revenue levels for pokies licence holders – that is, gambling losses – is a rough measure of levels of harm. Reduced revenue, conversely, is a sign that harm minimisation measures are working. Poker machines were first installed in Victoria in 1991, under Labor premier Joan Kirner. EGM losses in the state have been increasing in the decades since, but monthly losses began frequently exceeding $200m from 2004. In the 2019 calendar year, prior to the onset of the pandemic, Victorians lost $2.7bn on EGMs in total. December’s record losses were “a sobering reminder” of the dangers of gambling and “a record that should never have been broken”, said Tim Costello, chief advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform. The alliance has called for tougher regulation to hold the broader industry accountable in the wake of the damning royal commission into Crown Resorts, which continues to operate the lucrative Melbourne casino. In August 2021, in the midst of the royal commission, the Victorian state Labor government announced it would overhaul the regulatory body, the Victorian Commission for Liquor and Gaming Regulation, and the new VGCCC would have greater oversight in monitoring gambling harm-minimisation measures in both the casino and broader gambling industry. “Yes, people are waking up to the harm being done by this predatory industry,” Costello said. “Yes, the Victorian government has committed to first steps in holding Crown accountable. But what about the hundreds of millions lost every month in pubs and clubs? What action is being taken to address this crisis?” Costello pointed to measures such as pre-commitment systems that require gamblers to set limits on their gambling spending in advance, reduced opening hours for pokies venues and abolishing losses disguised as wins – when a player wins less than they bet – as key to reducing the amount of gambling harm felt in the community. Samantha Ratnam, leader of the Victorian Greens, said the record-breaking losses were “unfortunately really shocking but also not surprising”. “The longer we wait to protect people from the predatory pokies industry, the more families are likely to be preyed upon and the more it’s going to cost Victorians,” she said. The Greens have advocated for harm-minimisation measures including $1 bet limits, $20 pre-loading maximums, and jackpots not exceeding $500. The Victorian government has been approached for comment.",News/Australia news,‘Sobering reminder’: Victorians lose record $251m to poker machines in a month,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/sobering-reminder-victorians-lose-record-251m-to-poker-machines-in-a-month
2/26/2022,"As I unsubscribe from the ninth email in three days urging me to “refinance now!” if I don’t want to miss a “special rate!”, I curse my email doppelgänger. She’s landed us on a marketing database again and now I’m being inundated with spam. My email doppelgänger is the person whose emails I receive in error, presumably due to an extra vowel or missing dash. I don’t know if she’s actually a “she”, but I’ve constructed an identity for her from the bits and pieces I think I’ve gleaned: female, teacher, resides in the US. Despite the spam, I’ve become quite fond of my email doppelgänger, who is generally an inoffensive character. This feeling is just another example of the kind of one-sided parasocial relationship that is so ubiquitous in this era of mass media and digital communication. These people are strangers to us, but through small glimpses of their lives we feel as if they’re not. That’s due to a media psychology phenomenon called the media equation, according to Elizabeth Cohen, an assistant professor of communication studies at West Virginia University. “We tend to process things socially, even if they’re not really social,” Cohen says. “So, for instance, we act polite and considerate to machines such as computers and cars, even though we know they aren’t human. “We also empathise with celebrities even though we’ve never met them before, and we grieve for fictional characters even though they’re not even real. This occurs because we are, as a matter of human nature, hardwired to be social.” Not everyone is so lucky when it comes to their email doppelgänger. Take Katie*, who, as an early Gmail adopter with a very common name, has dozens of them. There’s Katerina in New York who didn’t show up for her second Covid vaccine, Ashley in Texas who owes her chiropractor $3,000, and the one who has a friend in North Carolina who likes to send photos of hamburgers. Katie has been getting these emails for years and admits they can be a drag. “It reaches a point where it’s so absurd,” she says. “I got caught up in this email thread of a kid’s soccer team … and they were fighting over who was picking up who from soccer practice. That one was probably the worst.” There was also the woman who bought a Nissan Pathfinder in Las Vegas. “I was getting reminders for her to service her vehicle. I felt kind of bad for her because I wondered if she just couldn’t afford it,” Katie says. This makes me think of the kind of narrative you might construct about a stranger passing in the street. There is something innately fascinating about catching a glimpse into someone else’s world and imagining what their life is like. In the online world, we are constantly surrounded by a kind of digital version of people-watching, only instead of a particular attitude or sense of style, we read people through their digital ephemera: what they subscribe to, where they live, or their travel and eating habits. “In digital media environments, there’s often not a lot of identity cues that you can gather about other people, compared to face-to-face communication at least, so the cues that you do get carry a lot of weight,” Cohen says. “When you get a small little snapshot of somebody’s life – somebody who shares something similar to you, like a name, by getting a misaddressed email – it’s pretty intriguing. It might not be much knowledge, but it kind of feels like an intimate knowledge because it’s personal.” So what do you about these people? Perhaps the ultimate response to an online doppelgänger was that of Josh Swain of Tucson, Arizona. In April 2020, Swain created a Facebook Messenger chat of all the Josh Swains he could find on the platform and challenged them to fight for the right to use their common name. there can only be one pic.twitter.com/VPamxjJ0yL “Precisely, 4/24/2021, 12:00 PM, meet at these coordinates, (40.8223286°N 96.7982002°W) we fight, whoever wins gets to keep the name, everyone else has to change their name, you have a year to prepare, good luck,” Swain wrote. A year later, hundreds of people named Josh turned up at Air Park in Lincoln, Nebraska. Five-year-old Joshua Vinson Jr was crowned the winner of a pool-noodle competition open to anyone with the first name of Josh, while the original Josh Swain from Tucson won the right to keep his name via a heated game of rock, paper, scissors with Josh Swain from Omaha. Of course, if you don’t have the energy to organise a mass pool noodle fight, there are other ways to make the best of things. Katie once signed into the Hulu account of one of her doppelgängers, watched a few movies listed in the premium subscription and logged out – but not before changing the password in a bid to alert the user to their error. Another time, when she was really fed up, she had the confirmation of a restaurant reservation go to her account. “I was like: ‘Why did you make a reservation during Covid?’ And so I cancelled the reservation. I felt terrible, but you know it was the height of Covid and I was like, ‘Don’t be going’.” Without these juicy options in the case of my own doppelgänger, I’ll have to content myself with the judicious use of the delete button for now.

2/26/2022,"“There was no struggle, nothing. And then he just slipped away ... the river swallowed him.” This is how a witness described the final seconds of Dr George Duncan’s life, as told to the ABC in 2005, 33 years after the 41-year-old University of Adelaide academic drowned in the River Torrens and posthumously set in motion the zeitgeist of gay law reform in Australia. The 10 May 1972 death of Dr George Ian Ogilvie Duncan – suspected to be at the hands of Adelaide’s police vice squad, at a time when homosexuality was outlawed in every state in Australia – is an event enshrined in the narrative of the South Australian LBTQI community. Writer Christos Tsiolkas and his partner Wayne van der Stelt first learned of Duncan’s revered place in SA’s legal history back in the mid-1980s, when the two young Melbourne university students made their first road trip together to Adelaide. “I remember us going to the Candlelight, which was one of the old queer clubs there, and hearing the story about what happened down at the river – hearing about the gay bashings and police bashings,” he says. “There was still a real sense of being in a frontier town … we were in the bourgeois, nice part of Adelaide, but we were getting warnings from gay men we were talking to in pubs, saying just be really careful. It was still going on, that was still part of the story of the city.” On 3 March, Adelaide festival goers will witness the multi-award winning Melbourne writer’s debut as a librettist, with Watershed: The Death of Dr Duncan, co-written with Sydney playwright Alana Valentine. Marking the 50th anniversary of Duncan’s death, the production, directed by Neil Armfield, will be delivered in the form of an oratorio, created by Queensland opera and composer Joseph Twist. Tsiolkas and Valentine agreed that the traditionally sacred form of oratorio – opera without the sets, costumes and staging, and deemed appropriate by the church for tackling religious material – was the most fitting medium to tell Duncan’s story. “One of the things about being queer is being sequestered from the sacred,” Tsiolkas says. “There’s a sense of being exiled from religious traditions and Duncan was a religious man [he was high church Anglican]. “That was what was great about writing an oratorio … doing it but not denying our queerness, because that’s what religious texts have done – deny that our bodies are part of the sacred. “Duncan died at a gay beat and we wanted that world to be communicated in the words of the music … That’s been exciting, working on those two things, the sacred and the illicit together.” The background story documenting Duncan’s life is compelling, as historian Tim Reeves can attest. The white upper middle class, Australian raised and Oxbridge educated history academic lived a secret life, as most gay men were forced to do, growing up in the 1950s and 1960s . Reeves has spent the better part of three decades documenting the Duncan case, he served as a consultant on the Watershed project and will be releasing his book The Death of Doctor Duncan at the Adelaide Writer’s festival on 9 March, where it is being launched by David Marr. The death toll from Australia’s long-standing criminalisation of homosexuality – through murder, manslaughter and suicide – was far from unique in the English speaking world, he says, but the rapidity of legislative changes following Duncan’s death was a world game changer. Three police officers were early suspected as the culprits who tossed Duncan, a man who despite his education at Melbourne Grammar – an exclusive school which prided itself as much on its athletic prowess as its scholastic rigour – was unable to swim. After an internal police investigation prompted widespread public skepticism, Scotland Yard detectives were called in to investigate independently – but the subsequent findings tabled in a parliamentary inquiry found that “there was no real intention of causing anyone’s death – this was merely a high-spirited frolic which went wrong.” In Watershed: The Death of Dr Duncan, the oratorio features a work with the chorus: “We thought faggots could float”. Within seven weeks of Duncan’s body being retrieved out of the Torrens, however, a private members bill was introduced into South Australian parliament. And in one of the more surprising details in Reeve’s book, it was not SA’s celebrated reformist premier at the time – Don Dunstan – who led the charge. It was a conservative in opposition to the incumbent Labor party, Murray Hill – then a member of the Liberal and Country League party, later to become the SA liberals – who pushed for legislation to decriminalise sex between two consenting adult males in the southern state. Reeve’s book reveals other disturbing details that are unlikely to make it into the oratorio’s libretto: the witness to Duncan’s drowning, Roger James, who first told his story to the ABC in 2005, was also tossed into the Torrens that night (he was never able to identify his assailants). James crawled out of the water with a broken leg and was rescued by a passing motorist who took him to hospital. That seemingly good samaritan was Bevan Spencer von Einem, subsequently convicted of the abduction, sexual torture and murder of 15-year-old schoolboy Richard Kelvin, and the suspected killer of at least two other gay men whose cases have never been solved. Von Einem remains incarcerated in a high security SA prison, marked never to be released in his lifetime. And in a final indignity to Dr Duncan himself, when the police finally retrieved his rigid body from the Torrens, the local TV news cameraman was running too late to capture it; the police returned Duncan’s body to the river and fished it out again for the broadcast. Hill’s legislation was modest. It only prevented police from raiding – without a warrant – private homes where two adult men were living together. But within three years, SA became the first jurisdictional territory in the English-speaking world to legalise equal age of consent for sexual intercourse at 17 years, regardless of gender. Tsiolkas was only 10, but remembers it well. “I didn’t have the words to express it at that age – about my identity and my sexuality. But I remember hearing the news…it must have on television, and I remember this quiet thrill – like it started in my belly. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. But that change was huge.” Valentine says the LGBTQI community today still remains profoundly aware of the way the law governs their lives. “All gay and lesbian and transgender people are uniquely aware of the fact that we live our lives subject to the law, and that the laws have a profound influence on the way you can behave publicly – what the limits of your love are and how they are defined legally.” Spending decades delving into the life of Dr Duncan – a man who has no surviving relatives to speak on his behalf – Reeves admits to the Guardian he is conflicted about the role he has played in the sudden resurgence of public interest in the academic’s life and death. “He was an extremely shy, intensely private and taciturn man, he may never have identified publicly as homosexual,” Reeves said. “And yet he has become a gay martyr, a queer icon in modern day parlance. I can hear him muttering darkly from the grave … if he is an icon, it is not because of his own actions, but because of his cowardly killers, who thought it was OK to throw poofters into the Torrens and then flee as they sank to the riverbed.” In his conclusion in the book, Reeves writes: “I am the person most responsible for placing Dr Duncan on a pedestal that would not have been of his choosing. I ask now that he be remembered as more than just an epithet.’’ Tsiolkas is more ambivalent. “Dr Duncan was a man whose life was taken in 1972. He hasn’t done what all of us sitting around this room have done … move through time. “I wonder, if he hadn’t been killed, would he have eventually found a way to find joy? To find pleasure, find love in the tumult of change that started to emerge? What kind of life could he have lived? And I think that’s the tragedy of the story, that’s the life that was taken away.”  The Death of Dr Duncan by Tim Reeves is out now through Wakefield Press.

2/26/2022,"Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has ridiculed the idea that by signing up to a Facebook account he signed away his rights. After years of attacking Facebook’s refusal to remove scam ads featuring his face, Forrest launched civil proceedings against the social media behemoth in California. He alleges the company’s failure to stop cryptocurrency-related scam ads were “negligent” and a “misappropriation of likeness”. In response, Facebook argued it was protected from liability because Forrest had a Facebook account, and had therefore agreed to the site’s terms and conditions. Forrest has now hit back at that claim, saying it must have come from a “junior lawyer” and emphasising that he launched the suit to protect victims, not himself. “That was obviously a junior lawyer who didn’t know jack about what he was talking about,” Forrest told Guardian Australia. He said when fake pages claiming to be him started proliferating on the site, his cybersecurity team worked with Facebook to clear them out, and to do that had to create an official Andrew Forrest page. “There were ‘Andrew Forrest’ pages appearing everywhere, particularly Andrew Forrest saying he’s lonely and if you’re out there, and you’re a rich, lonely (woman) … This was ages ago,” he said. So he “joined” Facebook when an official page was set up to counteract the fake ones, to “stop a crime”. He said he was taking action in California “not on behalf of myself … which is obviously why a junior lawyer made the comment [that he had signed away his rights]”. “They’ve obviously said that hundreds of times to thousands of victims,” he said. “I’m taking it on behalf of victims, for them, so nothing to do with me. I’m not bound by anything from Facebook if I’m taking action on behalf of victims, not on behalf of myself.” Social media ads falsely using Forrest’s and other high-profile Australians’ faces are being used to sell overpriced goods, or simply to take people’s money without providing anything in return, particularly when selling cryptocurrency. In one case, a Bunbury woman lost $670,000 to the scam, making payments to Australian and German bank accounts and to a credit card after she saw the fake ads on Facebook and LinkedIn. Forrest has argued since then that Facebook should be regulated as a publisher and made to take responsibility for the scams. He has launched separate criminal proceedings in Western Australia, alleging that Facebook has breached federal money laundering laws by failing to stop the ads. In the case lodged in the United States, he said Facebook was using its algorithms to allow alleged fraudsters to target vulnerable users, so it was “not simply providing neutral tools”. “Facebook is directly involved with developing and enforcing a system that subjects its users to illegal content,” the court filing states. Facebook argued that it has limited liability and that its terms of service make it clear that Facebook makes no guarantees it will always be “safe, secure, or error-free”, and that it does not control and is not responsible for third parties. In its response, filed in court, Facebook has argued that it cannot be held liable on a number of grounds, including that it is protected by section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act, which limits the liability of websites for third-party content posted on those websites.” Although it will not comment on the cases, Facebook has previously told the Guardian that it takes “a multifaceted approach to stop these ads” and is “committed” to keeping these people off the platform.

2/26/2022,"Our mother passed away this month. She was diagnosed with breast cancer five years ago. In 2021, it spread to her bones. That part I didn’t know. She kept it from me and my siblings. I guess she was trying to protect us. She’d started a new course of immunotherapy to bring the cancer under control. I can’t imagine the despair she felt when the oncologist told her the treatment had failed. I wish I was there to give her love and support. But I wasn’t. Our mother was a sweet, caring woman with an eccentric personality. She loved to read and had a vivid imagination. I took her for long country drives and we had lunch together. She’d spend the day at my place and play with the dog. Our relationship was strained from a difficult childhood, but we’d made great strides to repair it. She was a heavy drinker for a long time with a history of domestic violence and unhealthy relationships with men. Our mother lived in poverty most of her life. Her sixties and seventies were spent in boarding houses. At the time of her death she lived in a decrepit caravan park in regional Australia. The caravan park was rough and dreary and I hated going there. It was the last place a woman aged 77, battling cancer, should be. Our mother suffered a fall just before new year. It was the height of the Omicron wave in NSW and she was taken to the local hospital. She spent close to a month in that place. Visits were highly restricted due to Covid, and our only contact was via text messages. She spoke of feeling like a prisoner in the ward. She spoke of atrocious food she couldn’t eat. She spoke of getting no rest in a busy hospital overwhelmed with patients. Our mother was discharged with no follow-up support from social workers, or home-care measures put in place. When I spoke to her on the phone she was a frail woman who could hardly speak. I drove to the caravan park and found her curled up in a blanket. It was a shocking scene. She had lost half her body weight and was gray in the face. Her arms were swollen with bruises from botched blood tests. She was barely lucid and couldn’t hold a conversation. Her partner was exhausted and said he no longer had the strength to carry her to the shower and toilet blocks outside the caravan. Our mother was clearly dying, but she was terrified to go back to the hospital. I didn’t want her there either, and I didn’t want her to die in a decrepit caravan park. So I borrowed a wheelchair and bundled her into the back of my car. She lay in my lap and a friend drove us to another town. It was hot and humid and we plonked through potholes to a small community hospital where I prayed our mother would receive better care. We pulled up in the ambulance bay and several nurses rushed to the car. They were stunned by her condition. They feared they couldn’t provide the care she needed in the small facility. I was very pleased and grateful they admitted her. They gave her a private room and treated her with the dignity and respect she deserved. After a phone call to the oncologist and a review of her patient records, it was clear our mother had little time. The cancer had spread to her bones and her liver was failing. Nothing could be done to save her and palliative care was the only option. I spent hours at her bedside, spooning custard into her mouth and encouraging her to sip protein shakes. I bought her comfortable pyjamas and showed her photos of our dog on my phone. I told her I loved her again and again. I told her she was a wonderful mother and a beautiful person. I ached with grief for not knowing the cancer had spread, and not spending more time with her. I desperately wanted a conversation with our mother, but she was unconscious most of the time. Very rarely, she opened her eyes and I rushed to her side. She no longer recognised me and needed morphine for pain. It was so cruel to be there each day, unable to speak with her. Our mother’s death left me angry and full of questions. Why was a woman her age with cancer forced to live in a decrepit caravan park? Where were the social workers and home-care support services? Why has the affordable housing crisis in this country dragged on for years, with no intervention from this government, particularly the minister for housing, Michael Sukkar? I know our mother was terrified of going into aged care. It’s no surprise with an aged care system in absolute chaos and a minister, Richard Colbeck, who has repeatedly neglected his duty to reform the sector. Most of all I’m angry at the way the government handled the Omicron wave in the new year period when our mother was admitted to hospital. She was discharged from that place a battered, bruised and withered woman because of the dreadful care she received by an overwhelmed health system. Yes, she had cancer and her prognosis wasn’t good, but I’m convinced that what she endured hastened her death, and took her before we had the chance to say a proper goodbye. The protests by nurses in NSW over conditions in the healthcare system confirmed it. The federal and state governments failed our mother. It failed in its duty of care to protect a vulnerable elderly woman, and she’s not the only one. There are thousands of them. This mean, incompetent government must go. It’s failing our society and neglecting our welfare, housing, health and aged care systems.

2/26/2022,"A fund established to help farmers fight nationally significant court cases will pay for some of the legal costs of a company part-owned by Angus Taylor to challenge a finding that it destroyed critically endangered grasslands. The Australian Farmers’ Fighting Fund, which is administered by the National Farmers’ Federation, is providing financial support for the federal court case, which was launched by Jam Land in December. Jam Land is part-owned by the energy minister and his brother Richard Taylor, who is also one of the company’s directors. Late last year, a ministerial review affirmed that Jam Land had illegally cleared up to 28.5 hectares of natural temperate grassland on a property in Corrowong in southern NSW and was required to remediate. It also found the clearing to be in breach of a civil penalty provision of the environmental protection legislation. Jam Land was ordered to restore 103 hectares of grasslands on the property in the Monaro region of New South Wales. The company is challenging the remediation determination and is seeking a declaration that the listing of the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands as critically endangered in 2016 by the then-environment minister, Greg Hunt, was invalid.

While Angus Taylor’s interest in Jam Land is through an indirect shareholding, it puts him in the unusual position of being connected to a case challenging the decision of one of his government’s own ministers. Richard Taylor, who has previously described the legal action as a matter of principle, said the costs of the case were expected to amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. He said through discussions Jam Land initiated via the NSW Farmers Association that the Australian Farmers’ Fighting Fund (AFFF) had agreed to make “a significant contribution”. He declined to put a figure on value of the contribution. “One of the reasons that we’re pleased they have supported the case is that they support cases that are of significance to farmers,” Taylor said. “It just demonstrates that the case is of great importance to agriculture.” The fund, whose involvement in the case was first reported by the Weekly Times, has previously supported legal actions such as the successful class action launched by farmers in response to the 2011 ban on live cattle trade to Indonesia. The fund did not answer specific questions from Guardian Australia but its chair, Hugh Nivison, provided a statement saying the fund had approved an application from Jam Land “for support in a matter concerning the interpretation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act”. “In approving the application, the trustees determined the matter was a clear demonstration of the ambiguity and uncertainty in the act, and how the government’s approach to its implementation could have massive ramifications of farmers,” Nivison said. “In supporting this case, the AFFF seeks to resolve that ambiguity and uncertainty so Australian farmers can manage their land for balanced production and environmental outcomes, knowing with certainty what rules they have to follow.” The Jam Land investigation has been controversial because Angus Taylor sought meetings with senior environment officials about the grasslands while the investigation was under way. Documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws in 2019 revealed treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s office subsequently sought advice about whether laws protecting the grasslands could be changed. Angus Taylor has repeatedly stated that he sought the meeting with departmental officials on behalf of constituents in Hume who were concerned about the grasslands listing. He has previously said: “I did not make any representations to federal or state authorities in relation to any compliance action being undertaken.” The department has previously said officials did not discuss the compliance matter with Taylor. Both Taylor and Frydenberg have said the meeting was focused on the “technical aspects” of the grasslands listing. Guardian Australia has been told Angus Taylor has had no involvement in the legal action, the decision to launch the appeal or the decision to seek support from the AFFF.

2/26/2022,"Nigel Ng’s comedy career skyrocketed under lockdown, when his Uncle Roger persona, policing other people’s Asian cookery for laughs, went viral on YouTube. A fair few of his five million subscribers will form the audience to the 30-year-old’s current tour, and Ng doesn’t scruple to give them exactly what they want. Jokes about rice, jokes about inadequate British cooking, jokes that – no matter how they begin – tend inexorably towards generalisations about east Asian behaviour. Fair enough: we’re not exactly oversaturated with Asian immigrant perspectives on life in the UK. And many of Ng’s are amusing enough. In character as Uncle Roger, he takes down Boots-branded sushi and western food allergies. As himself (which is pretty much Roger minus the exaggerated accent) he contrasts British versus Asian dating and British versus Asian child discipline, a routine that founders on an over-attenuated gag about John Lewis’s returns policy. Throughout his show, Ng maintains a lively relationship with his enthusiastic crowd. Occasionally the material rises above the generic: Ng addresses a recent breakup and a shocking experience of (it is assumed) racist assault. But even these routines soon swerve back into his Asians-do-this comfort zone. Latterly, it can feel a bit barrel-scraping (“Asians don’t pay for our TV licences, do we?”). And not tremendously edifying, as Ng jokes about the quality of Asian faeces, chuckles at his own unlovely jokes about paedophilia and mocks the environmental beliefs of a 12-year-old in the front row.

2/26/2022,"Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe which are part of the alliance, but UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an “existential” war between Russia and the west. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, chaired a virtual summit of 30 leaders on Friday, where the agreement was made to amass forces in eastern Europe. “No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies,” the leaders said in a joint statement. “We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the alliance.” Stoltenberg said Russia’s invasion was “the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades”. “Russia has shattered peace in Europe. The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom in the face of Russia’s unprovoked invasion. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction.” James Heappey, a UK defence minister, earlier said the UK would send further armed forces to Estonia “earlier than planned” to reinforce the Nato ally. The Royal Welsh battlegroup will be arriving in the country to double force levels. Heappey also revealed that a total of 1,000 UK troops were on standby to support Ukraine’s neighbours with refugee responses. “The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine,” he said. However, Heappey also warned against any potential meeting between Russian and Nato troops, saying it could become “existential”. Speaking in parliament, he said: “We must all in this house be clear that British and Nato troops should not, must not, play an active role in Ukraine. We must all be clear what the risk of miscalculation could be and how existential that could very quickly become if people miscalculate and things escalate unnecessarily.” During the debate, Heappey was pressed by MPs to support a no-fly zone across Ukraine, which he rejected because of the risk of Nato forces encountering Russian ones. In an earlier exchange on BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme, the Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko pleaded with Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, for the UK and the US to close airspace above Ukraine “in order for these casualties not to escalate”. However, Wallace said this would constitute a direct act of aggression towards Russia, which would prompt a response and result in “war across Europe”, as any attack on the UK would implicate all other Nato members. Wallace said: “To do a no-fly zone I would have to put British fighter jets against Russian; Nato would have to declare war on Russia.” He added: “I cannot and won’t trigger a European war but I will help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can support them.” Wallace said the UK had supported accelerating Ukraine’s Nato membership, which would have triggered military intervention from fellow members, but that other countries had been concerned by the pace. He added that other democratic countries had a “moral duty” to continue to arm the Ukrainian forces since it was widely acknowledged that Putin “won’t stop at Ukraine” and would proceed to train his sights on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as he “doesn’t believe the Baltic states are countries”.He told Sky News: “What you’re seeing on your cameras today is illogical. Putin didn’t need to do this, he didn’t need to occupy a sovereign country. None of the reasons why he would do that stack up. He’s not doing something that’s logical, he’s doing something about his ego and his legacy.” As the EU and UK decided to bring in sanctions against Vladmir Putin, the Russian president, and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Boris Johnson and allies from the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance including Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands agreed on the need to go further after a meeting on Thursday morning. Downing Street said the leaders “agreed that more sanctions were needed, including focusing on President Putin’s inner circle, building on the measures that had already been agreed”. It said Johnson had made clear to Nato allies that the UK “stood ready for any further request from Nato’s supreme allied commander Europe to go further with military support to Nato from UK armed forces”. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he believes “further financial restrictions” against Russia are needed. He said if Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through parliament “very, very quickly” with Labour’s support. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, briefed MPs on the prospect of further sanctions next week and also summoned the Belarus ambassador to London, Maxim Yermalovich, to the Foreign Office. He was told members of its ruling elite would be sanctioned as a result of their role in facilitating the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. James Cleverly, the Europe minister, said afterwards: “The UK condemns the role Belarus is playing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Belarus must stop supporting Russia’s illegal and unprovoked actions.”",News/World news,Nato to deploy extra troops to alliance nations in eastern Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/nato-deploy-extra-troops-eastern-europe-ukraine-russia-war
2/26/2022,"As Boris Johnson told parliament that Europe must wean itself off Russian gas – to loosen Vladimir Putin’s “grip on Western politics” – the Nikolay Zubov tanker was making its way back from British waters to the port of Sabetta, in northern Siberia. The 300m-long vessel had recently dropped off a consignment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the Isle of Grain terminal, in the Thames Estuary, operated by the National Grid. Steaming north under a Cypriot “flag of convenience”, it charted a course for Russia’s Artic coast, near the vast $27bn Yamal gas facility, personally inaugurated by Putin in 2017. Britain gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, either flowing through subsea interconnector pipelines or arriving by boat at the Isle of Grain and two further LNG facilities at Milford Haven, South Wales. In the EU, whose gas market is so intermeshed with Britain’s that it effectively determines the prices paid by UK end users, the picture is very different. Russia exports between 150bn and 190bn cubic metres of gas to Europe each year, typically fulfilling 30-40% of demand across the continent. It accounts for 65% of imports into Europe’s economic powerhouse Germany and 100% for countries such as Latvia and Czech Republic. The obstacles to replacing Russian supplies are logistical, financial and political. So, if Europe – and by extension the UK – want to reduce their reliance on Putin’s pumps, what are the options and how feasible are they, particularly in the short term? LNG is super-chilled gas, condensed into liquid form and transported by ship and “regasified” at specialist terminals. Ports including Milford Haven and Grain – Europe’s biggest LNG terminal – take regular shipments. In 2020, Russian LNG accounted for 3% of total UK gas supply and, so far at least, there is no sign of shipments being affected by sanctions. European ports including Montoir in France, Zeebrugge in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands have also welcomed Siberian visitors of late. Figures provided by Argus show that Russia has supplied 16% of Europe’s LNG since February 2020. But Russia doesn’t come close to being one of the biggest LNG exporters, a list headed by the US, Australia and Qatar. Qatar is reportedly willing to increase LNG exports to Europe and, even now, shipments of LNG from the US are moored off Milford Haven, at the South Hook and Dragon terminals. On paper, Europe has the capacity to import an extra 147 billion cubic metres of LNG a year, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie, enough to replace Russian pipeline gas entirely. But Wood Mackenzie’s European gas analyst Graham Freedman said the switch would take “at least a decade” in practice, not least due to a lack of onward infrastructure in the right place. Germany, Europe’s biggest gas market, has no LNG import terminals. Even a temporary switch would be hugely expensive. Tom Marzec-Manser, lead European gas analyst at energy consultancy ICIS, pointed out that LNG production is limited and consignments go to the highest bidder. European countries already wrestling with sky-high prices would have to outbid increasingly gas-hungry Asian economies. “It’s an incredibly expensive short-term gap filler,” he said. Britain and Norway’s North Sea fields, not to mention onshore resources in the Netherlands, contain sizeable reserves but scope for upping the flow is limited. Marzec-Manser says Norwegian state energy firm Equinor has raised production but there’s “not much more they can do”. UK North Sea output is already on the decline, with limited headroom for a short-term increase. Holland’s vast Groningen field is an option in theory but probably not in practice, say analysts at Jefferies. It could provide 13 billion cubic metres, equivalent to 9% of Russian supply. But the Dutch government is winding down production after drilling was found to be causing earthquakes. Reversing that decision looks politically unpalatable. Nuclear power reduces reliance on gas for electricity and the UK generates up to 20% of its power that way. While much of the fleet is due to be retired by 2025, the government has thrown its weight behind rebuilding that capacity. But doing so takes time and does little to replace gas in cooking or heating homes. France gets 70% of its power from nuclear energy, affording it much more protection from volatile gas prices. But Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants. Those decisions have left it more dependent than most major economies on Russian gas. In practice, Germany is unlikely to change its mind on decommissioning nuclear power stations. Given the climate crisis, few European countries are minded to turn back to coal. The government ordered a moratorium on all new fracking wells in 2019 but the gas price crisis has brought advocates out of the woodwork. They include Lord Frost – who presided over the UK’s Brexit negotiations – and Viscount Ridley, who chaired Northern Rock when it collapsed. The idea is that the UK could mimic the shale gas revolution that has transformed the US into a net energy exporter. Experts say otherwise – that fracking our way out of the Ukraine crisis doesn’t make geological, logistical, economic or political sense. Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School, points out that the UK’s reserves are harder to tap geologically than the US’s. Unlike the US, potential sites are surrounded by densely populated areas that are governed by strict planning laws and full of people who don’t actually support fracking, making it politically impossible. Concerns about water and noise pollution persist and even if those were overcome, fracking would have vanishingly little impact on European wholesale prices, while also taking years to develop. “By the time we did it, we probably wouldn’t need the gas,” said Bradshaw. Ultimately, renewable energy and decreased demand, by improving home energy efficiency through better insulation, offers the most obvious long-term solution. However, this depends on major investment and improvement in technologies such as battery storage, which makes up for the intermittency in supply from technologies such as wind power. Marzec-Manser says that the Ukraine crisis might well motivate Europe to go hell for leather for a renewable future but that it is already moving faster than any other part of the world. “It’s like trying to move into sixth gear when your car only has five gears,” he said.",News/Business,How can Europe wean itself off Russian gas?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/how-can-europe-wean-itself-off-russian-gas
2/26/2022,"Charities and opposition parties have urged the government to do more to help with an expected surge in refugees fleeing Ukraine after the Russian invasion, with concerns also raised about the issuing of visas now UK diplomats have left the country. With the UN refugee agency warning that as many as 5 million Ukrainians could be forced to flee, the Liberal Democrats called for a comprehensive and fully funded refugee scheme. Mark Drakeford, the Labour Welsh first minister, said he wanted his country to be a “nation of sanctuary”. Dozens of refugee charities have jointly called for an evacuation and resettlement plan similar to the one that housed thousands of families in the UK after the Balkans conflicts in the 1990s. However, asked whether it planned to take any Ukrainian refugees, Downing Street said it was instead “working incredibly closely with Ukraine’s neighbours” to support them in coping with Ukrainians fleeing the country, and 350 extra UK troops were in Poland assisting. Foreign Office teams have been sent to countries including Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova to help with immigration efforts, primarily for UK nationals, now British staff have been withdrawn from its embassy in Ukraine, but can also assist other nationalities. In a letter to Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, the Lib Dems called for a full resettlement scheme, including a five-year funding package for councils that take Ukrainian nationals. Drakeford said he had discussed the likelihood of large numbers of refugees being pushed across Europe, adding: “We have an ambition in Wales to be a nation of sanctuary.” In contrast, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the UK should help refugees find assistance in countries neighbouring Ukraine. She also called for efforts to ensure Ukrainians with family members in the UK could join them. The Home Office has already said that Ukrainians in the UK on temporary visas can extend them or switch to another type of visa while still in the country. Caroline Coombs, from the campaign group Reunite Families UK, said the package of measures did not go far enough. She said: “The Home Office has provided emergency visas for family members of British citizens, which has at least given some British citizens and their families the chance to get out, but with the visa application centre in Kyiv and the airspace now closed we’re concerned about how this all plays out for those still left in the country and who urgently need to get across borders.” “Under normal circumstances, the UK spouse visa rules are very harsh and a minefield for people to navigate,” Coombs added. “If they were more humane and fair in the first place, many more British citizens and their families could have safely been back in the UK already.” Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, said that while the concessions were “useful”, there was more the government could do to help those fleeing the Russian attacks. “The nationality and borders bill the government is pushing through parliament right now will criminalise any Ukrainians seeking refuge here and there are already huge backlogs in the asylum system, which have more than doubled during Priti Patel’s tenure as home secretary.” Alex Piletska, an immigration lawyer, said that the concession “clearly does not go far enough and excludes, in particular, elderly relatives of British citizens. The Home Office should update its policy or risk stranding British citizens in a war zone.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government’s priority remains supporting British nationals and their families who want to leave Ukraine. We are working around the clock to process visa applications.”",News/World news,Charities and opposition parties urge UK to do more for Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/charities-and-opposition-parties-urge-uk-to-do-more-for-ukrainian-refugees
2/26/2022,"Just a few weeks after its 30th anniversary, the Russian Federation has gone to war with Ukraine, a country proud of its history, but which spent 700 years largely under foreign rule. The initial Russian offensive began on three fronts on Thursday to the sound of a missile barrage. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, sent tanks to pound Ukraine’s cities. His warships attacked from the sea. Innocent civilians are being killed, their homes reduced to rubble. With Russian forces closing on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and the government asking its three million people to take up arms, Mr Putin’s war “to stop genocide” may promote one. Mr Putin is acting like a thug. He is threatening the international system by taking what he wants, irrespective of the human cost. A humanitarian crisis looms as tens of thousands of refugees cross into eastern Europe. The images beamed from the streets of Ukraine have rekindled memories of the wars of the 20th century – of a kind that once seemed unimaginable in 2022. Many have been left to wonder: is this a new cold war? Or the beginning of a third world war? Of the two, the former is unwanted but preferable to a global conflagration. This explains why Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s pleas for help from the west have gone unanswered. Mr Zelenskiy may get more weapons. There is also diplomatic condemnation against Russian aggression. But Ukraine will not receive any military assistance – such as a Nato-enforced no–fly zone – that would shift the odds decisively in Ukraine’s favour. Mr Putin’s threat to those who try to intervene with nuclear retaliation is dangerous and reckless. Only someone prepared for a war of extinction would utter such a warning. Western nations have decided, for the moment, that tough sanctions would hurt them more than they would hurt Russia. In the 24 hours after Mr Putin signed a decree recognising two breakaway Ukrainian territories, the Bloomberg financial news service calculated that the EU, the UK and the US spent $600m on Russian oil and gas products. This would explain why the west’s sanctions package against Moscow’s banks is designed to allow energy payments to continue. But the dependence on Moscow is unsustainable – as is a wider economic war of attrition. Instead, the west, and Europe in particular, must start managing without Russian gas by ramping up supplies of greener sources of energy. Russia’s determination to impose a military solution to the political problem of Ukraine is a criminal mistake resting on a might-is-right argument. Russian officials claim to be open to talks, but Mr Putin’s description of the Ukrainian government as “a band of drug addicts and neo-Nazis” shows Moscow is not serious. The world is sliding into a protracted international struggle for spheres of influence between great powers. A Ukrainian defeat would see Washington pivot to a Europe where potentially Russia and the US see each other as enemies. Yet hostilities would have to remain below a certain threshold. Even if Mr Putin achieves quick success, parts of the Ukrainian military that are not defeated are likely to continue fighting – raising the prospect of grinding guerrilla warfare against Russian occupation or a puppet government. Mr Putin’s primary goal is for Ukraine never to join Nato. His other demand would limit Ukrainian sovereignty so that the country would be firmly in Moscow’s grip. Without compromise, the Russian president will isolate himself and his country from the European continent. Ukraine’s people should be able to choose their governments and these ought to be able to face both east and west without hostility. Mr Putin’s war is putting paid to this, which is a tragedy of immense proportions. But history does not end when victory is declared. Wars are never won forever.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on Putin’s Ukraine war: promoting bloodshed, not ending it | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-putins-ukraine-war-promoting-bloodshed-not-ending-it
2/26/2022,"In his 1939 poem The Unknown Citizen, WH Auden imagines a composite of a working man built of public records – union lists, social psychology notes, health-card, insurance policies. A man so well-behaved and average and compliant (“he held the proper opinions for the time of year … our teachers report he never interfered with their education”) that he must be happy: “Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.” The state erects a marble statue of him, calls it JS/07 M 378, and moves on. But of course the point is that statistics cannot capture the warp and weft of actual lives lived, the things that matter. It is true that the so-called everyday is now far more noticed and celebrated in literature, music, drama, academia and politics than before (though the recent Brexit-driven attempt to set “ordinary” in opposition to “elites” and “experts” cannot be called an especially positive advance). And Auden’s poem was in fact written two years after the launch of that extraordinary testament to ordinary lives, the Mass Observation project. However, it is still the case that the nation’s monuments – stately homes, castles, statues – overwhelmingly memorialise the small percentage of the population with a lot of money, for whom official history is a family affair. Auden’s ironies still bite. This week Historic England launched an attempt to further redress the balance, soliciting applications for Everyday Heritage Grants. Sums of up to £25,000 will be awarded to projects that highlight the hidden histories of places where “ordinary people” have worked, lived or socialised. The initial focus is specifically on working-class experience and culture; if it is successful, subsequent rounds may have slightly different emphases. Selina Todd writes in The People: The Rise and Fall of the Working Class, 1910-2010 (which began out of frustration at the invisibility of people like her parents in the historical record) that this group, “composed largely of manual workers and their families … and lower grade clerical workers”, accounted for “more than three-quarters of British people until 1950, and more than half as late as 1991”. There is also what has been called a “working class of the mind”: Historic England refers to 2016 research that found 60% still identified themselves as working class despite a marked decline (to 25%) in people working in routine and semi-routine occupations. The “ordinary” has good claim to be the dominant history, and is certainly as colourful. Part of the international success of working-class-set series Peaky Blinders, its creator Steven Knight argued this week, came from rejecting the “cultural cringe” that means the English do not “write songs about Huddersfield or Bolton or Birmingham”. He took “the experiences of ordinary people and made them as big and vivid and wild as they really are”. The money offered by Historic England is not for passive plaques or effigies. The intent is for the ordinary to be brought into view through art projects, oral histories and as-yet unthought-of interventions, to reveal the hidden histories of streets and factories and fields, and by doing so to rescue the unknown citizen’s individuality and idiosyncrasy from the smoothed marble of statistics.

The news agencies, most of which are government-sponsored, say that Putin did the right thing. They are trying everything to show us that Ukraine does not deserve to exist as an independent country. And they say that the Russian government did everything to stop Ukraine. But stop them from what? That is the question. My family tree spreads across many countries including Russia and Ukraine. I don’t know what my national identity is. I was born and raised in a very small town in Russia near the Ukrainian border. My mother still lives there. On the morning of 24 February, she woke me and my brother up with a call. I picked up the phone, but I couldn’t answer properly. My stammer, which had not bothered me since I was 17, came back in December, when the geopolitical situation began to deteriorate sharply. She said that the war had started. She was woken up by a loud explosion at around 6am. The windows in her house rattled. She said that she was packing her things and documents to go to my grandmother who lives in the city, which is further in from the border. I felt that something was irrevocably broken. As a child, my family and I often went to Ukraine, to the Kharkiv and Sumy regions, to my grandmother’s relatives and for shopping. In 2014, Putin began destroying Donbas and our visits became impossible. My father was afraid that they would burn our car because of the Russian licence plates. My grandma was afraid that the US would attack her home in Russia if she visited Ukraine again. My siblings and I were not afraid of anything at all. Ukraine was, is and will always be our second home. Now, 25 February, I am sitting in the office but, just like yesterday, I can neither work nor think about anything except my mother, all the defenceless Russian and Ukrainian people, and the Ukrainian and Russian soldiers. Many of them will be brought home in closed coffins. I have already seen this in 2014, when my aunt’s sons died in Donbas. She turned grey. I do not wish this on any mother in Ukraine, Russia, or any country in the world.

2/26/2022,"The father of a young teacher who killed himself after experiencing years of gambling problems has told an inquest that the addiction “destroyed” his son. Jack Ritchie died in Hanoi, Vietnam, aged 24. His parents, Charles and Liz Ritchie, from Sheffield, believe that failures of UK authorities to address gambling issues contributed to their son’s death. Ritchie’s parents believe the hearing is the first Article 2 inquest – an enhanced inquiry that probes the role of the state – in a case relating to suicide following gambling. This means its scope will include an examination of whether any part of the state breached its duty to protect his right to life. The couple believe an undiagnosed gambling disorder lay behind their son’s death and have argued there were no public health warnings about the risk to life posed by gambling products. They say their son was not diagnosed or offered treatment that linked his symptoms to a gambling disorder. The inquest heard on Friday that Ritchie’s parents “regard gambling as the root cause and trigger of Jack’s death”. Charles Ritchie told the hearing in Sheffield: “It took this happy, healthy 16-year-old and gradually, over the course of seven years, it destroyed a part of him. “The very essence of that amazing young man was torn apart, was destroyed by gambling so that he could see himself as being the villain, as being the bad person, as being the weak person, as being the irresponsible person, and he took that on because he was a nice guy.” Ritchie was working as an English teacher in Vietnam when he killed himself in November 2017. Earlier this week, the Sheffield coroner David Urpeth heard that the teacher began playing on fixed-odds betting terminals when he was about 16 or 17 years old. His father said that before he left for Vietnam, he “was very positive” and “starting to find his way into adult life”. He told the inquest: “He probably thought he had escaped gambling, was free of it and going to lead the amazing life that was ahead of him.” Charles Ritchie said the addiction “killed him” over the “final four days of his life”. He said his son had “crashed out” after coming to the end of his overdraft. Jack’s mother said their son “blamed himself for harming us”. She told the inquest: “He had been told by the lack of information that gambling is normal, that it’s only a tiny proportion of people who are addicted and there’s something wrong with them, that it was all his fault for not only doing the gambling but harming us because of it.” The inquest continues.
