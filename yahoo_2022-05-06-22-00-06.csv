5/6/2022,"By Maki Shiraki TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's airlines are betting on a travel recovery this summer after the COVID-19 doldrums, as many Japanese look to head overseas for the first time in years now that fully vaccinated residents no longer face quarantine curbs on their return. After encouraging demand for flights to Hawaii during a just concluded popular holiday season, Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) and ANA Holdings Inc are hoping the outbound rise will help fill some of the gap from Japan's ongoing ban on foreign tourist arrivals. Japan on March 1 waived all quarantine and isolation requirements for triple-vaccinated residents returning from the United States and a range of other countries. It also lowered its U.S. infection travel warning from April 1. ""The fact that you don't have to quarantine upon return is a big reason why we chose Hawaii,"" said Masahiro Sugiyama, who was travelling with his wife and two children. An upswing in demand for flights to Hawaii, a long-favoured destination for many Japanese, is seen as a bellwether for the overall travel sector. It also shows that the airlines are keen to capitalise on pent up demand - even though higher fuel costs, a weak yen and expensive testing requirements are driving up costs for travellers. ""If I don't go when I can, I don't know when I'll have another chance,"" said Kaori Sato, a college student about to depart on a week-long trip to Hawaii with her mother and sister. ""I'm still worried about corona, but I've had three vaccine shots, so I think I'll be fine."" BOOKINGS JUMP Last year, just 510,000 Japanese went abroad, according to government statistics, down from more than 20 million in 2019. But international bookings before the start of the recent holiday break, known in Japan as 'Golden Week', surged: At ANA they jumped more than five-fold and JAL more than four-fold, the airlines said before the start of the holidays. ANA said it aims to bring back more flights to Los Angeles, New York and other destinations popular with Japanese tourists. There are also hopes a ban on inbound tourists could be lifted soon after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Thursday that border measures would be reviewed next month. JAL plans to resume daily flights to Hawaii from June, while ANA said it will return to using its largest planes, the 520-seater Airbus A380, for some Hawaii routes from July. Meanwhile, customers will have to pay as much as 62,000 yen ($475) per ticket as a fuel surcharge. Hawaii-bound Angie Matsuo said she and her parents also had to pay more than 100,000 yen combined for PCR tests required before leaving, equating to more than $250 each. Another test is needed before returning home. ""The testing is a hassle because it takes a lot of money, time, and effort,"" Matsuo said. ""The depreciation of the yen and various price hikes are also a pain. But I don't know when I'll be able to go again, so it's now or never.""

5/6/2022,"Russia's most advanced tank in service was destroyed by Ukraine this week, according to reports. The military vehicle had been in Ukraine for less than two weeks before it was hit, officials said. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the tank was hit by a Javelin anti-tank missile system. Russia faced yet another military setback this week following reports that one of the country's most advanced tanks in service, the T-90M, was destroyed just days after it was deployed to Ukraine. Ukrainian journalist Andriy Tsaplienko first posted a picture of the charred vehicle on Wednesday from the Kharkiv region, which he said was recently liberated by Ukrainian forces. Tsaplienko shared a photo of himself standing in front of the ruined tank, jokingly telling his followers that the destroyed vehicle is ""hot, it's smokin' hot."" The journalist said Russian troops on Wednesday attempted to reclaim the territory but failed to make headway. Tsaplienko reported that the scraps of Russia's destroyed tank will be displayed in an upcoming May 9 parade commemorating the end of World War II. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine confirmed the T-90's destruction in a Thursday statement, saying the battle vehicle nicknamed the ""Breakthrough"" had arrived in Ukraine just one week prior to its demise. ""Thus, the image of the Russian army, which many in the world feared, has degraded and fallen over the past two months to such an extent that few could have imagined it,"" the statement said. According to Newsweek, the machine's presence in eastern Ukraine was first reported on April 25. The Defense Ministry said the tank was hit by Ukrainian forces with an American Javelin anti-tank missile system near Izyum. The agency reported that an MT-LB armored personnel carrier and an infantry fighting vehicle were also destroyed in the attack. In its statement, the Defense Ministry said the missile system ""turned a super-modern Russian tank into a pile of scrap metal."" The T-90M tank, which is one of the newest additions to Russia's T-90 series, is the most technologically advanced battle vehicle within Russia's frontline arsenal, according to The Drive, and was first issued to Russian military divisions in the spring of 2020. The outlet estimated that only about 100 models are currently in service. Russia's T-14 Armeta is newer than the T-90M, but still in production. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the T-90M is equipped with a powerful engine, panoramic sight with rangefinder, a thermal internal imaging channel, and a fire control system. The new design also features multi-layered armor and ammunition placed outside the unit, according to the ministry. Multi-channel sight in the tank allows it to fire at all times of the day. ""All these upgrades do not seem to have helped the T-90M, which is already seen as the first confirmed loss of a tank of this type in Ukraine,"" the Defense Ministry said in its statement. Last month, Russia suffered another embarrassment after its Black Sea flagship ""Moskva"" sunk after being hit by a Ukrainian missile.

5/6/2022,"U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, responded to a man claiming COVID vaccines give people AIDS by telling him ""everything you say may be true."" Johnson was speaking to Todd Callendar, who bills himself as an ""international lawyer"" and ""leader of a group trying to stop the Biden regime's effort to destroy the U.S. military via injections of the so-called vaccine that contains HIV."" During Callendar and Johnson's conversation on the rightwing video-sharing platform Rumble, Callendar again claimed the various COVID vaccines give users AIDS and that health officials need to be ""held accountable."" ""You've got more than a hundred doctors here, all of whom will tell you these shots caused vaccine-induced AIDS,"" Callendar said, even though no reputable doctor has made such a claim. ""They purposefully gave people AIDS...this is criminal intent."" Johnson interjected, but not to refute Callendar's lies about the vaccines. Instead Johnson said Callendar and other anti-vaxxers have to continually spread falsehoods about the shots so they can convince people they give people HIV or AIDS. ""That's way down the road,"" Johnson said about criminalizing health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to the president. ""You got to do one step at a time. Everything you say may be true but right now the public views the vaccines as largely safe and effective.""  Johnson, up for reelection this year, is one of the most rightwing members of the Senate. He has pushed for the veterinary drug Ivermectin to be used to fight against COVID — though no evidence exists of its efficacy — and he even suggested mouthwash could defeat the disease that has killed nearly 1 million Americans, reports the Wisconsin Examiner. Johnson's conspiracy theories and delusion have touched on HIV and AIDS before his discussion with Callendar. He infamously said in December that Fauci ""overhyped HIV"" and AIDS in the 1980s.

5/6/2022,"The Fed may no longer be a friend of investors, pros say, and that could be a major headwind to stocks in the near-term. ""What’s dangerous about yesterday’s huge market slump is that there must be an element of doubting the ability of there to be an effective 'Fed Put' in this cycle following a 30-40 year period where the central bank has almost always been able to come to the market's rescue,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,120 points on Thursday, or 3.3%. The S&P 500 tanked 3.7%. As for the Nasdaq Composite, it tanked 5.2% for its worst day since 2020. Amazon shares hit a fresh 52-week low. ""As bad as today was, the VIX Index is not showing sufficient 'fear' to indicate a near term bottom,"" said the team at DataTrek. The VIX settled at 32.85 on Thursday. Thursday's brutal session represented a swift sentiment reversal from Wednesday, when traders breathed a sigh of relief after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank was not considering a 75 basis-point increase in interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 932.27 points and the S&P 500 gained 2.99% on Wednesday, the largest gains for the two indices since 2000. Even the beaten-up Nasdaq Composite popped 3.19%. As Reid suggested, it now appears that traders have formed a more lasting near-term view that the Fed is far from dovish, has let inflation get out of control, and is still poised to dramatically slow down the economy through a series of 50 basis point rate increases. ""I can't help but think that a great deal of the reaction yesterday was the appreciation that whilst the Fed can make soothing pronouncements, they are starting from an extraordinary difficult starting point and with limited flexibility to respond to market or economy concerns whilst they fight inflation,"" Reid added. ""The only conclusion you can draw is that the market quickly realized that the Fed really aren't going to be able to control this cycle very easily.""

5/6/2022,"One of the hallmarks of Biden Administration press conferences has been the ongoing repartee between Fox News White House Correspondent/gadfly Peter Doocy and press secretary Jen Psaki. Doocy’s carefully-crafted questions often take surprising turns and seek to frame events in a politically-disadvantageous way for the administration. They’re meant to to elicit a TV moment.

So with Psaki announcing she will leave her post this month, Doocy tried one more time to catch her off guard with the most disarming tactic of all: He played nice. When the press secretary called on him, Doocy started with, “Sorry to see you go.” Psaki shot back with a sideways glance and a biting, “Are you?” which elicited laughter across the briefing room, even from Doocy. “Yes,” he responded, “and you’ve always been a good sport. On behalf of everybody,” he continued, waving his hand around the room, “thank you.” “Thank you. As have you,” she replied. Doocy then launched his opening salvo, “Do you think that the progressive activists that are planning protests outside some of the [Supreme Court] justices’ houses are extreme?” Psaki responded curtly, and things were back to normal.

5/6/2022,"After being berated with racial slurs for not wearing a mask, an Indian man is pursuing charges against a Taiwanese man for “public insult, embarrassment, and verbal abuse.”

On April 29 at 2:40 p.m., the Indian man, a 36-year-old entrepreneur who asked to be identified only as “Mike,” was grabbing a coffee with an Indian national friend at Louisa Coffee in Hsinchu, Taiwan, reported Taiwan News. A Taiwanese man sitting near Mike then approached him, demanding that he put on a mask.

When Mike explained that he was not wearing one in order to drink his coffee and questioned the Taiwanese man for yelling at him, the man responded, “I’m Taiwanese.”

After the 36-year-old told the Taiwanese man to call the police if he felt that a pandemic regulation had been violated, the Taiwanese man became increasingly aggressive, yelling: “You Indian, Indian man, black man, get out of Taiwan.”

According to Mike, he has been living in Taiwan for seven years with his Taiwanese wife and two children. The man in the video can also be seen criticizing Mike for being unable to speak Chinese.

“You don’t speak Chinese but you have been living here for seven years?” the Taiwanese man said to Mike.

Mike recorded parts of the incident, which occurred for over 10 minutes, and after the Taiwanese man called the police, who arrived at the scene around 15 minutes after the incident began.

 

After checking both of the men’s identifications, the Taiwanese man was let go, and Mike was told to file a report at the police station. Officers reassured Mike that he did not violate any law and would not be charged with fines. Under the criminal code of Offenses Against Reputation, Mike pressed charges for “public insult, embarrassment, and verbal abuse.”

Mike told Taiwan News that the incident was the first time he had faced racism while living in Taiwan and was disheartened that “people like him are destroying Taiwan’s reputation.”

“But I won’t let it go, I’m giving my voice on behalf of every single person who is being insulted or abused,” Mike was quoted as saying.

After revealing that she had her breast implants removed, the former professional driver is opening up about body image and what led to her decision to go under the knife.

""These were my reasons and to me these narratives are the problem. Implants just feed into it. Culture feeds into it. Social media feeds into it. Filters feed into it. Unhealed trauma feeds into it."" She went on to say that ""the work is always an inside job"" but ""the real question is - how can I do the emotional work to see myself as perfect, having it all, and feminine? When we do that, we won’t seek outside validation or a way to get it."" She concluded, ""Super grateful to be feeling better so quickly. To be clear, the transparency of the dangers of implants are an issue. I also understand that mastectomy’s require options. However, all I’m saying is, if we don’t have an insecurity issue... any potential risk or danger go away."" Patrick claimed she was suffering from breast implant illness, which motivated her to have the implants removed. While breast implant illness is not considered an official medical diagnosis, patients have reported a variety of symptoms ranging from chronic pain to brain fog. In April, Patrick opened up about her decision to get her breast implants removed following a long list of health complications that started in 2018 and intensified by the end of 2020.

5/6/2022,"The 17-second video shows the moment drones hit two Russian Raptor fast-attack craft. The Russian patrol boats were destroyed in the Black Sea near Snake Island, a strategic and symbolic location for Ukraine. The drone used to sink the Russian ships is known as Bayraktar TB2, built by Turkey. Ukraine said on Monday its drones sank two Russian ships in the Black Sea near Snake Island, which the Russians had captured the day the war broke out on February 24. ""Two Russian Raptor boats were destroyed at daybreak today near Snake Island,"" Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi wrote on social media platforms. ""#bayraktar is doing its job,"" he continued, referring to the Turkish unmanned combat aerial vehicle known as the Bayraktar TB2, that reportedly helped sink the two Russian Raptor fast-attack craft. Along with the message, Zaluzhnyi posted a 17-second video that allegedly shows the moment the drones hit the Russian raptors at 4:51 am local time. Russia made no comment on Ukraine's claim, the Wall Street Journal reported, but said it destroyed three Bayraktar drones without providing any evidence. Raptor-class boats are 55-foot-long vessels armed with machine guns that are used for patrol missions, with a crew of three and space to ferry up to 20 troops. Although it is small – only 42 acres – Snake Island is strategically important because it sits at the edge of Ukraine's territorial waters in the Black Sea. A report last year from non-partisan think tank the Atlantic Council called Snake Island the ""key to Ukraine's maritime territorial claims"" in the Black Sea. Snake Island has also become a legendary symbol of resistance for Ukraine, as military defending the island refused to surrender to Russian forces on February 24, radioing ""Russian warship go screw yourself,"" when the Russian flagship cruiser Moskva approached. The patrol boat losses add to the mounting toll for the Russian Navy. In April, the Moskva sank after being hit with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile, the Pentagon confirmed.

5/6/2022,"Chechen troops in Ukraine loyal to Ramzan Kadyrov have claimed a reputation for being the most brutal in Putin’s war, but a new report says they’re actually suffering major losses and going to great lengths to cover them up. According to an investigation by Russia’s independent news outlet IStories, the official figure of 13 Chechen soldiers killed in Ukraine is a major undercount; a source in the Chechen Health Ministry tells the outlet the true death toll of the so-called Kadyrovtsy at least matches that of the Dagestani troops killed in Ukraine, which totals 123. A source involved in sending the bodies of Chechen fighters back home told IStories the Chechen battalions are incurring injuries and deaths every single day. One would never know that from looking at the social media chronicles of Kadyrov, who has sought to cultivate an image of Chechen troops as both fearsome fighters and compassionate rescuers, with images and videos shared to Telegram and the social networking site VK that often seem blatantly staged, showing troops being greeted with open arms by elderly villagers and firing weapons at invisible targets. The One Mistake Putin Is Dying for Us to Make Kadyrov’s troops have also been accused of some of the most heinous war crimes in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with many survivors of the Bucha massacre identifying the soldiers who indiscriminately murdered and tortured civilians as members of Chechen battalions. But the PR campaign by Kadyrov has at times backfired in spectacular fashion, such as when the strongman leader appeared in a video in mid-March purportedly being briefed by his men in a basement in the Kyiv region, only for Ukrainian journalists to use phone data to prove that he was actually in Belarus, followed by even the Kremlin and a source in the Chechen government confirming he was not, in fact, in Kyiv. Or the now notorious photo of Kadyrov supposedly on his knees praying in Ukraine—in front of a gas station owned by a company with no presence in the country. Ukraine’s Security Service said at the time that the “clown and coward” Kadyrov was just trying to scare Ukrainian troops by suggesting he had come to join the war. One of Russia’s Most Heinous War Crimes in Ukraine Was Worse Than We Thought  Behind the scenes, Kadyrov’s image campaign is said to have masked his own dysfunction, such as when he reportedly threw a hissyfit over Russia’s decision to retreat from Kyiv. When Russia’s Defense Ministry decided mid-March to pull troops back from the region after an unsuccessful bid to seize the capital, Kadyrov lashed out, fuming that his men were too prestigious to be moved to Mariupol, according to IStories. He is said to have butted heads with both the leadership of Russia’s Defense Ministry and the National Guard, getting back at them by ordering his men return to Chechnya to get some “rest,” sources told the news outlet. And in his latest attempt to flaunt Chechen military prowess on social media, Kadyrov proudly declared Thursday that his men had “liberated” the village of Svetlichnoye in the Luhansk region—a village that had already been under the control of Russian proxies in the Luhansk People’s Republic since 2014.

5/6/2022,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan signalled on Thursday that it had abandoned a plan to buy advanced new anti-submarine warfare helicopters from the United States, saying they were too expensive. Taiwan had earlier said it was planning to buy 12 MH-60R anti-submarine helicopters, made by Lockheed Martin Corp unit Sikorsky, but domestic media said the United States had rejected the sale as not being in line with the island's needs. Asked in parliament about recent changes to Taiwan's purchases of new U.S. weapons, Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng mentioned the helicopter case first. ""The price is too high, beyond the scope of our country's ability,"" he said. Two other arms purchases have also been delayed - M109A6 Medium Self-Propelled Howitzer artillery systems, and mobile Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. The Raytheon Technologies' Stingers are in hot demand in Ukraine, where they have been used against Russian aircraft, but U.S. supplies have shrunk and there are significant hurdles to producing more of the anti-aircraft weapons. Chiu said they had already signed the contract for the Stingers and paid for them, and they would press the United States to deliver them. ""We don't view arms sales as a trifling matter, and we have back-up plans,"" he added, without elaborating. Taiwan says the United States has offered it alternatives to the M109A6, including truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin called the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS. Chiu said they were still considering their options on that. A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment on specific platforms but said: ""The United States' swift provision to Taiwan of defensive weaponry ... is essential for Taiwan's security, and we will continue to work with industry to support that goal."" Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, is undertaking a military modernisation programme to improve its capabilities to fend off a Chinese attack, including with precision weapons like missiles. President Tsai Ing-wen has championed the concept of ""asymmetric warfare"", which involves developing high-tech, highly mobile weapons that are hard to destroy and can deliver precision attacks. U.S. officials have been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so it can become a ""porcupine"" that is hard for China to attack. China has been ramping up its own military modernisation and pressure against Taiwan as it seeks to force the democratically governed island to accept Beijing's rule. Chiu said that recently - without giving a timeframe - there were many ""enemy ships"" in the waters around Taiwan, which ""in principle stand off"" with Taiwanese forces. He did not give details. Eight Chinese naval vessels, including the aircraft carrier the Liaoning, passed between islands in Japan's southern Okinawa chain on Monday, an area that is to Taiwan's northeast.

5/6/2022,"Chief Justice John Roberts called it ""absolutely appalling"" that a draft Supreme Court opinion could be leaked. Roberts comments come just days after Politico published a draft opinion in which the court overturns abortion rights. The chief justice was making his first public appearance since the report. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts called the leak of a draft opinion ""absolutely appalling"" on Thursday during an address to federal judges, according to CNN. Roberts told his fellow federal judges that it was ""foolish"" for the unknown leaker to believe they could affect the court's work. He also chalked up the breach to ""one bad apple."" The chief justice was making his first public appearance since Politico's extraordinary publication of a draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would explicitly overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, ending a federal right to an abortion. Roberts, according to CNN, was speaking to ""lawyers and judges at the 11th Circuit Judicial Conference."" The court has since confirmed the authenticity of the draft decision that was published on Monday. Roberts also condemned the leak and announced an investigation to find out how the secretive high court suffered such an embarrassing breach. ""I think this situation right now is Chief Justice Roberts' worst nightmare,"" David Lat, a close court watcher, previously told Insider. At the time, Roberts called the leak a ""betrayal of the confidences of the court."" Some Senate Republicans have called for the FBI to be involved in the investigation, although it's unclear what federal law could have been violated. Republicans have also openly speculated that the opinion was leaked by someone with liberal views, but there's no evidence to that effect and it's not yet clear what the person who leaked the opinion was trying to achieve. In its initial report, Politico described the source of the opinion as only ""from a person familiar with the court's proceedings."" The Supreme Court is currently considering a challenge to Mississippi's anti-abortion law that effectively bans almost all abortions after 15 weeks. The law was one of a series that was specifically designed as a way to get the high court to potentially overturn Roe completely. A spokesperson for the court did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle. Danica Patrick is the latest celebrity to share her story about getting her breast implants removed after suffering from medical issues. In a recent post to her Instagram account, the former NASCAR driver describes her history with breast implants, which she originally had done November 2014. “I got them because I wanted to have it all. I was really fit, but I didn’t have any boobs,” she writes. ""So I got them. Everything went well, and I was happy with them.” In the same post, Patrick details the physical symptoms she experienced, which she says began in 2018 and intensified in 2020 when the ""wheels came off."" “I had cycle irregularity, gained more weight, my hair wasn’t looking healthy at all and my face was a different shape (weird I know),” she says, adding that she went down a “rabbit hole” to try to figure out what the issue was. “I did every test that could be done.” Patrick isn’t the only celebrity to open up about breast implant removal. In August 2021, former ""Bachelorette"" Clare Crawley revealed she was also going through with the explant procedure after suffering autoimmune issues, swollen lymph nodes and strange rashes on her body. In her message, Patrick says her health symptoms were related to a condition called breast implant illness, adding “the common denominator” is having issues you “can’t resolve.” Dr. Stephen Nicolaidis, a plastic surgeon at Contour Clinic in Montreal, was not involved in Patrick’s case, but says he has people from all over Canada, even as far away as Brazil, travel to see him to remove their breast implants due to breast implant illness. Breast implant illness is a term used by doctors and women to “refer to a wide range of symptoms that can develop after undergoing reconstruction or cosmetic augmentation with breast implants.” Symptoms can occur with various types of implants, including silicone filled and saline filled. Breast implant illness is not currently an official medical diagnosis, and some experts describe it as a “diagnosis by exclusion.” “Diagnosis by exclusion means that there is no test for it, but there are tests for other things that have the same symptoms or similar symptoms,” Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research tells ABC News. “If there is no other reason for this array symptoms, then there are doctors who will call it breast implant illness.” Breast implant illness is much more recognized than it used to be, but there are still stories online of women with medical issues going to see their doctors and having their symptoms dismissed. Nicolaidis tells Yahoo Canada that he has colleagues who are surprised that he believes in breast implant illness. However, in his experience, patients who have their implants removed ""come back saying they feel better."" Doctors agree that social media is a huge part of the awareness and also offers support to women who are experiencing similar health problems. One of the largest Facebook groups, Breast Implant Illness and Healing by Nicole, was created several years ago by a woman who says she also suffered from breast implant illness. It now has more than 160,000 members. Patrick herself turned to the internet throughout her medical ordeal, saying she watched over 100 stories on YouTube. All of this attention has led to more discussions in the medical community. “It’s recognized enough that the FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] now talks about it,” Nicolaidis says. In October 2021, the FDA updated its safety requirements regarding breast implants, including new label warnings added on implant packaging and making a patient decision checklist for patients so they can understand the risks before the surgery. Symptoms may vary for each person. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons lists the more common ones as the following: Fatigue Muscle and joint pain Memory and concentration problems Hair thinning/loss Skin rashes Depression Migraines As for when someone will experience these symptoms, that also depends on the person. “I’ve had patients come and ask me, it breaks my heart because it’s literally two months after their augmentation, and they’re feeling so sick they want them out,” Nicolaidis says. “That’s the quickest within a month or two.” However, Nicolaidis adds that majority of patients won’t experience symptoms for at least a couple of years, if not longer. Nicolaidis estimates that one to 10 per cent of breast implant patients will suffer from breast implant illness. When asked who exactly is at risk of getting sick, the Canadian specialist says that is “not 100 per cent clear.” Generally, doctors say women have a greater risk of developing breast implant illness if they have a personal or family history of autoimmune disease, suffer from a chronic condition like fibromyalgia, have multiple allergies, or have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. Nicolaidis was performing breast augmentation surgeries up until a year ago because he says he wanted to learn more about risk factors that cause the illness. “Then I started seeing patients who had no risk factors and still developed breast implant illness,” he explains. “That’s when I decided OK forget it, I’m not implanting anymore.” A common treatment option for people suffering from breast implant illness is having both implants and the surrounding scar tissue removed. Patrick says she felt better almost immediately after surgery, noting her face “had more colour and less dark circles,” her face started producing oil again, she could take deeper breaths and she had more energy. While some effects are felt much quicker, other issues may take longer to resolve. “[Patients] who have developed full blown autoimmune illnesses from their implants, those ones are slower to get better,” Nicolaidis explains. “They often require not just removal of the implants and the capsule, but they also require medical care in order to improve.” When it comes to advice he offers his patients, Nicolaidis believes the risks of breast implant surgery should not be downplayed and says the decision should not be made “light-heartedly.” “There are many complications that can arise,” he advises. “For patients who have enough breast tissue you’re better off probably having a lift than an augmentation cause then you have your own tissue, you’re not going to have to have other surgeries.” As for Patrick, she says she will continue to share her progress as she goes along. “If this post helps just one get to the root of their issues, it did its job,” she says.

5/6/2022,"The U.S. Air Force’s Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter will be the most expensive fighter jet ever built. NGAD will also be the first sixth-generation fighter, designed to fight China in the Pacific. The crewed fighter will also control robotic wingmen, each of which will cost more than an F-35. The U.S. Air Force is bracing the public—and Congress—for the highly anticipated Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter and the sticker shock wave the world’s first sixth-generation jet will leave in its wake. The NGAD fighter, set to begin replacing the F-22 Raptor in 2030, will cost “multiple hundreds of millions of dollars,” easily two or three times the cost of the F-35. The fighter is being optimized for the Asia Pacific theater and will be accompanied into battle by robotic sidekicks. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, in remarks reported by Defense News, told lawmakers that the crewed version of the NGAD fighter jet would cost “multiple” hundreds of millions of dollars. NGAD includes both crewed and uncrewed fighters; the uncrewed version would cost no more than half as much as the crewed version. A per-unit cost of $200 million would easily make crewed NGAD fighters the most expensive fighter jet of all time. And to be clear, Kendall’s statement leaves plenty of room for the jet to actually cost in excess of $300 million. For context, the F-35A costs $77 million, while the new, updated F-15EX Super Eagle costs $80 million. If a crewed NGAD costs $300 million and the uncrewed version $150 million, that same pot of money could buy nearly six F-35As. NGAD is a fundamentally different aircraft than the F-35A. The F-35A was designed in the 1990s as an economical replacement for several fighters, including the F/A-18C, AV-8B Harrier, F-16, and A-10 Thunderbolt. The F-35 was designed to fulfill multiple missions, including traditional fighter air-to-air roles, air-to-ground strike roles, and close air support. The new fighter is better compared to—and will replace—the F-22A Raptor, the world’s first fifth-generation fighter, designed purely for the air superiority mission. We don’t know a lot about NGAD other than that it was designed and flown in less than a year. The strategic environment has changed a lot since the late 1980s, when the Raptor was first envisioned, and NGAD will reflect that. The aircraft is likely to be laser-focused on China, which means operating over the sweeping expanse of the Asia-Pacific region. A war with Beijing will involve moving tactical aircraft across thousands of miles; operating from remote bases carved out of tiny islands; and flying long-range missions against enemy air and ground defenses. An NGAD might, for example, fly 1,400 miles from Guam to Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa. There, it could bolster the island’s air defenses, protecting the American and Japanese bases on the island from Chinese fighters attempting to establish air superiority and strike aircraft pummeling allied bases. On the way there and back, it could use its range to skirt around Chinese warships with long-range surface-to-air missile systems.  The F-35 can’t do that, but that’s not what the F-35 was meant for. The F-22, however, can’t do that either, and that’s what the F-22 was meant for in the first place. What will NGAD look like? Stephen Trimble, defense editor at Aviation Week & Space Technology, spelled out some ideas at the Check Six podcast. Trimble suggests a long-range fighter with the ability to cruise at 70,000 feet—much higher than current fighters—above the speed of sound, using breakthrough technologies such as daytime or optical stealth. One thing we can infer about the new fighter is that it will be big. Previous-generation fighters used external fuel tanks to extend their range on combat missions, allowing aerial refueling tankers to stay out of harm’s way. External fuel and weapons, however, ruin an aircraft’s stealthy profile, making it much more visible to radar. As a result, NGAD will have to store a large amount of fuel and air-to-air missiles under the skin, buried within the fuselage of the aircraft.  Trimble suggests NGAD could be as large as the F-111—a large, long-range strike aircraft that served from the late 1960s to the 1990s. The F-111 was 73 feet long, could fly from treetop level to 60,000 feet, had a maximum takeoff weight of 100,000 pounds, and with internal fuel alone had a range of 2,600 nautical miles. The F-22 is 62 feet long, flies at up to 65,000 feet, has a maximum takeoff weight of 83,000 pounds, and has a range of 1,600 nautical miles while carrying 10,000 pounds of fuel in external tanks. This number suggests that, if the Air Force wanted an air superiority fighter with a 2,000-nautical-mile range (enough to fly from Guam to Okinawa), an F-111-sized aircraft is not far from the mark. No matter what NGAD actually looks like, it will probably be unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. It will also cost a lot more than we’ve ever paid for a fighter jet before. But in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which many predicted would never happen, it seems likely that the U.S. will indeed pay whatever it costs—both to deter China from launching a similar attack on Taiwan or, if deterrence fails, clearing the skies of People’s Liberation Army Air Force fighters.

5/6/2022,"By Kirsty Needham SYDNEY (Reuters) -Fiji authorities searching a yacht they seized on behalf of the United States as it presses Russia over the invasion of Ukraine have found documents implicating its suspected owner, Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, in breaking U.S. law, the FBI said. The Amadea arrived in Fiji on April 13, after an 18-day voyage from Mexico, and has since been the focus of a U.S. bid to seize it as part of U.S. sanctions against Russia. Fiji police and FBI agents seized the Amadea at a wharf on Thursday, two days after a Fiji court granted a U.S. warrant that linked it to money laundering. Fiji's High Court on Friday refused a stay application by the vessel's registered owner, Millemarin Investments, to stop U.S. authorities removing it from Fiji, Fiji's public prosecutor said in a statement. The $300 million superyacht had been handed over to U.S. authorities, it said. The FBI said in an affidavit attached to the U.S. seizure warrant that Fiji authorities had found documents on the Amadea showing breaches of U.S. law because Kerimov was sanctioned by the United States in 2018. ""There is probable cause to believe that Kerimov and those acting on his behalf and for his benefit caused U.S. dollar transactions for the operation and maintenance of the Amadea to be sent through U.S. financial institutions, after a time which Kerimov was designated by the Treasury Department,"" the FBI said. The vessel had running costs of $25 million to $30 million, it said. Lawyers for its registered owner, Cayman Islands company Millemarin Investments, have denied it is owned by Kerimov. The vessel's lawyer, Feizal Haniff, declined to comment to Reuters on Friday. The U.S. alleges Kerimov has beneficially owned the Amadea since August 2021 but evidence for this claim was redacted in the warrant. The FBI said the Amadea had tried to avoid being seized ""almost immediately"" after Russian troops entered Ukraine. ""Amadea turned off its automated information systems (AIS) on February 24, 2022, almost immediately after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" the FBI said. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and that the war is an unprovoked act of aggression. The vessel's paperwork showed the next destination would be the Philippines but the FBI believed it was headed to the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok. Many Russian oligarchs have attempted to move their yachts to Russia to escape U.S. sanctions since March, the FBI said. The U.S. Justice Department's Taskforce KleptoCapture has focused on seizing yachts and other luxury assets to put the finances of Russian oligarchs under strain in a bid to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. FBI Director Christopher Wray, commenting on the seizure of the Amadea in Fiji, said in a statement: ""The FBI, along with our international partners, will continue to seek out those individuals who contribute to the advancement of Russia's malign activities and ensure they are brought to justice, regardless of where, or how, they attempt to hide.""

5/6/2022,"Russia's forces have performed far worse than anticipated and, 70 days after the start of the country's invasion of neighbor Ukraine, Ukraine's air force is still holding its own -- thanks, in part, to American military equipment supplying the country with anti-air defenses. Ukraine's forces have destroyed at least 26 Russian planes and 39 helicopters since the beginning of the invasion, according to Oryx, an open-source intelligence blog that keeps tabs on Russian military losses. That success led to media reports of a legendary flying ace dubbed ""The Ghost of Kyiv,"" a mythical pilot whose supposed exploits downing dozens of Russian aircraft spread like wildfire in the early days of the campaign when Ukrainian forces were looking for signs of hope. Read Next: Ukraine Repels Russian Attacks; Mariupol Plant Battle Rages But after reports began to surface this week that the Ghost had been shot down and killed in combat, the country's air force was forced to confess that he was never real. ""The information about the death of the The Ghost of #Kyiv is incorrect,"" Ukraine's air force wrote on Twitter. ""The #GhostOfKyiv is alive, it embodies the collective spirit of the highly qualified pilots of the Tactical Aviation Brigade who are successfully defending #Kyiv and the region."" Ukrainian Maj. Stepan Tarabalka was identified as the ""Ghost of Kyiv'' by multiple media outlets last week, but the news was later clarified by the country's air force. He was a pilot who died in combat March 13 and was posthumously awarded the title Hero of Ukraine, but he was not the mythical flying ace. But even without the Ghost, Ukraine's ability to hold its own against Russia's massive fleet has been notable. One Ukrainian pilot interviewed by CNN on Wednesday, identified only by the call sign ""Moonfish,"" told the news organization he believes Ukraine's pilots have had to get clever to push back against Russia's modern aircraft in the skies. ""We're still operating freely in the airspace that we control and, even though they are a massive fleet of more advanced aircraft, we're able to keep them away from the area we maintain,"" the pilot told CNN. ""We did learn a couple of tricks on how to fight with that technological advancement."" Russia has been touting its Sukhoi SU-57 stealth fighter jet and has more than 120 SU-34 bombers, 360 attack helicopters and hundreds more jets in its fleet, according to a report from CNA, a nonprofit research organization that tracks military strength for the U.S. Navy. But Russia has not been utilizing its full force, focusing less on air-to-air warfare and opting for long-range missiles to attack stationary targets. In part, this has to do with the surge of anti-aircraft weapons the U.S. has given to Ukraine to aid in its fight against Russia. So far, weapons approved to send to Ukraine include more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, upward of 5,500 Javelin anti-tank missiles, 700 Switchblade drones, and more than 120 Phoenix Ghost tactical drones. The war is shifting to a new phase, with tough fighting expected in the east of the country as Russia tries to solidify its claims to separatist regions. How Russia's air strategy will change isn't yet clear, but Ukrainians don't appear to be relying on myth anymore. Their pilots are seeing real-world success in what continues to be a brutal, hard-fought campaign. -- Thomas Novelly can be reached at thomas.novelly@military.com. Follow him on Twitter @TomNovelly.

5/6/2022,"MIAMI (AP) — A little-noticed federal appeals court ruling this year threatens a key weapon in the United States’ war on drugs: A decades-old law that gives the U.S. broad authority to make high-seas arrests anywhere in the world, even if the drugs aren’t bound for American shores. It’s a law that’s used to round up and imprison hundreds of foreigners every year, mostly poor, semi-literate fishermen from Central and South America who make up the drug trade’s lowest rungs. “It is a waste of U.S. taxpayer dollars to have these costly misadventures as we play drug police to the world,” said Eric Vos, head of the public defender’s office in Puerto Rico that brought the court challenge. At issue is the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, which defines drug smuggling in international waters as a crime against the United States and gives the U.S. unique arrest powers anywhere on the seas — whenever it determines a vessel is “without nationality.” But how a vessel is deemed stateless sometimes gets messy. The was the case for the Costa Rican plaintiff Jeffri Dávila-Reyes, whose appeal prompted the ruling. The Coast Guard chased down his speedboat in the western Caribbean in 2015 as he and two cousins were allegedly transporting five to 15 kilos of cocaine. They identified their vessel as hailing from Costa Rica, according to the FBI’s summary of the investigation, but they lacked any documentation. When the U.S. asked the Costa Rican government to confirm the vessel’s registry, it responded 12 weeks after the bust that it could neither confirm nor refute the claim. A few weeks later the men were charged and eventually pleaded guilty to possessing narcotics “on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” But a three-judge panel of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled in January that one of the law’s provisions — disavowing a captain’s claim of nationality — were an unconstitutional extension of U.S. policing powers beyond America’s borders. Tellingly, almost none of those arrested under the law had ever set foot in the U.S. nor were they charged with trying to import cocaine. In Dávila-Reyes’ case, the cocaine he was accused of transporting was purportedly headed to Jamaica. Despite the ruling that threw out his conviction, Dávila-Reyes remains behind bars seven years into a 10-year sentence as the Justice Department seeks reconsideration by all of the First Circuit’s nine judges. In a series of recent letters to The Associated Press from federal prison, Davila-Reyes reflected on how he only got involved in smuggling as a way to escape poverty in his homeland after years of hand-blistering construction work for $10 a day. He said taking a chance on smuggling offered him $6,000. “Nobody can be blamed for being born poor,” he wrote. From the moment President Richard Nixon declared “war on drugs” in 1971, the U.S. Coast Guard has been at the forefront of the campaign to stop illegal narcotics from entering the U.S. Today, it spends more than $2 billion annually as part of that effort. But, almost from the start, that goal has proven elusive. Cocaine prices, a gauge of supply, have been hovering at historical lows for more than a decade as cocaine production from Colombia has soared to record highs. In a good year, barely 10% of cocaine shipments in the waters off Central and South America — where the bulk of the world’s cocaine is trafficked — are actually seized or destroyed, according to the U.S. government’s own estimates. Despite that poor record, U.S. officials continue to tout their success at sea. A 2020 Coast Guard report said at-sea interdictions are the most effective way to combat cartels and criminal networks. Since 2017, the amount of cocaine it has seized or destroyed exceeds 959 metric tons. Prosecutions under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act exploded last year to 296 — nearly five times the number a decade ago, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which collects Justice Department data. But since each case involves multiple defendants, the actual number of foreigners detained at sea last year was 635 — the highest tally since 2017. Critics of U.S. drug policy say most such smugglers fell into the job because of poverty and are hardly worth locking up for so long when legions of their poor compatriots stand ready to take their place. “These are not masterminds like Pablo Escobar or Chapo Guzman,” said Kendra McSweeney, an Ohio State University geographer who has spent years researching U.S. drug policies. Neither the Coast Guard nor Justice Department would comment on Dávila-Reyes’ appeal but experts say it’s too early to judge the fallout from the landmark ruling. Currently Vos’ office in Puerto Rico is preparing 14 motions for dismissal in other boat cases on behalf of jailed defendants from Colombia, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. The ruling has also been cited in at least five proceedings outside the First Circuit. “It’s definitely a chink in the armor,” said Roger Cabrera, a court-appointed attorney in Miami seeking who has filed one of the appeals. “But like most chinks, I’m sure the federal government is already looking for a workaround.” For now, U.S. law enforcement continues to conduct regular search and seizures on the high seas with little indication of concern. In court filings, attorneys for the U.S. government have argued in part that holding up interdictions to wait for an unequivocal denial of registry from a foreign nation before declaring a vessel stateless would be impractical. “Anyone involved with bringing dangerous drugs into the United States will be held accountable, no matter their position in the drug-distribution network,” said Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman. ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/",U.S./Associated Press,Ruling threatens US power as world's high-seas drug police,https://news.yahoo.com/ruling-threatens-us-power-worlds-162955758.html

5/6/2022,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's air force scrambled on Friday to warn away 18 Chinese aircraft that entered its air defence zone, Taiwan's defence ministry said, part of what is a regular pattern of incursions that has angered the government in Taipei. Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has complained of repeated such missions by Chinese aircraft, which have become a common occurrence over the past two years or so. Taiwan is currently in a heighten state of alert due to fears China could use Russia's invasion of Ukraine to make a similar military move on the island, though Taipei's government has not reported any signs Beijing is about to attack. The number of aircraft involved was well off the last large-scale incursion, 39 Chinese aircraft on Jan. 23, and since then, such fly-bys have been with far fewer aircraft. The ministry said the latest mission included six Chinese J-11 and six J-16 fighters as well as two H-6 bombers. There was no immediate comment from China's Defence Ministry. China has described previous such missions as to defend the country's sovereignty and to counter ""collusion"" with foreign forces - a veiled reference to U.S. support for Taiwan. The bombers, accompanied by a Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft, flew to the south of Taiwan through the Bashi Channel which separates the island from the Philippines. The other aircraft flew over an area to the northeast of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the top end of the South China Sea, according to a ministry map. Taiwanese fighters were sent up to warn the Chinese aircraft and air defence missiles were deployed to ""monitor the activities"", the ministry said, using standard wording for how Taiwan describes its response. No shots have been fired and the Chinese aircraft have not been flying in Taiwan's air space, but in its Air Defence Identification Zone, a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols that acts to give it more time to respond to any threats. Japan this week reported eight Chinese naval vessels, including an aircraft carrier, passed between islands in Japan's southern Okinawa chain, to the northeast of Taiwan. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and the Taiwan Strait remains a potentially dangerous military flashpoint.

5/6/2022,"Paul Murdaugh’s former girlfriend detailed in court papers how the Murdaugh family enabled Paul’s binge drinking while underage, prior to a deadly boat crash in 2019. In a sworn affidavit filed Thursday in Hampton County, Morgan Doughty stated she has first-hand knowledge of how her ex-boyfriend Paul Murdaugh drank excessively, how Murdaugh’s parents funded and allowed him to do so while he was underage, and how Doughty has videos to prove it. The February 2019 boat crash, which killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach and shed the first harsh spotlight on the Murdaugh legal dynasty, prompted a civil lawsuit against the Murdaugh family and Parker’s convenience stores. It’s been over three years since the lawsuit was filed. The Doughty filing comes a day before a Friday hearing in Lexington County on the boat crash case, where jailed patriarch Alex Murdaugh’s attorneys are expected to argue to remove the “receivership” which is controlling and examining Murdaugh’s finances. Alex Murdaugh is incarcerated awaiting trial on charges he stole $8.4 million belonging to clients and colleagues. The boat crash lawsuit accuses the Murdaughs of negligence in enabling Paul Murdaugh’s drinking prior to the boat crash and Parker’s for allowing him to purchase beer using his older brother’s ID. But since then, Paul, 22, and Maggie, 52, Murdaugh were both found shot to death on June 7, 2021 at the family property “Moselle” in Colleton County. Their still-unsolved murders have caused every aspect of the Murdaughs’ lives to be picked apart by police, prosecutors, media and the public. Doughty’s filing further illuminates the behavior that led up to the fatal boat crash that first brought scrutiny on the Murdaugh family name. Paul Murdaugh, son of Alex Murdaugh, “consumed alcohol on an almost daily basis and regularly drank to the point of becoming grossly intoxicated,” a fact known by his family members, according to Doughty’s affidavit. Murdaugh would regularly drink to the point of drunkenness while in front of his family members, the affidavit said. He drove cars and boats while under the influence, and Murdaugh’s parents gave him money to purchase alcohol, according to the document. In the affidavit, Doughty lists out 22 videos, and screenshots from those videos, that she took prior to the boat crash where Paul Murdaugh was intoxicated with his family or was enabled by his family. They include: ▪ A video taken on July 4, 2018, where Doughty is administering a shot to Murdaugh’s father, Alex Murdaugh. She said Paul Murdaugh was on the boat and also grossly intoxicated. ▪ A video taken on Dec. 31, 2018, where Paul Murdaugh was intoxicated from alcohol provided by his father, the affidavit states. Afterward, “Paul drove Alex’s truck, with Alex’s knowledge, and wrecked into one of his Paul’s friend’s BMWs. Alex paid cash to fix the car after the collision,” the document states. ▪ A video taken in December 2017, where Paul Murdaugh is intoxicated at Moselle, from alcohol he used his brother’s ID to buy and “with his parents’ knowledge,” Doughty said. “Paul’s mother picked us up that night because Paul was so drunk and acting crazy,” the document said. ▪ A video taken in Arizona in 2017, where Paul Murdaugh’s brother, “Buster,” is arm wrestling with Alex’s friend, lawyer Cory Fleming, the affidavit says. Fleming has since faced indictments in the Murdaugh saga and also provided Paul with alcohol that night, the document states. ▪ A video, without a date, taken of a party at Moselle where “Alex provided a keg of beer for a number of minors,” and Buster saw his brother intoxicated. ▪ A video taken at the Boathouse restaurant on Hilton Head Island, where Paul used his brother’s ID to buy alcohol, while Buster used his passport. “Paul’s parents were present and knew and paid the bill for the alcohol,” the affidavit states. ▪ The last two videos came from a wedding in 2018, where Paul had become intoxicated and his parents were there and knew of his condition, the document states. “Alex and Maggie argued on the way home that night because Alex also took a pain killer and became aggressive. We dropped Alex off at his parents’ house on the way home because of his aggressive behavior.” The behavior detailed in the legal filing is consistent with the picture revealed of Paul Murdaugh when he was taken to the hospital following the boat crash that killed Beach on Feb. 24, 2019. He was belligerent, unruly, and appeared intoxicated, according to prior reporting by the Island Packet & Beaufort Gazette newspapers. Why such behavior matters now is because of how police deviated from regular practice when investigating the offense of boating under the influence and how Paul Murdaugh’s father, Alex, attempted to interfere with the police investigation, prior reporting revealed. His actions prompted speculation in the community that the powerful family was attempting to use its influence to cover up for Paul Murdaugh’s actions. Paul Murdaugh came from a long line of lawyers, most of whom controlled the prosecutor’s office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit. His father, Alex, formerly a partner of the Hampton law firm his great-grandfather started, found himself the subject of a lawsuit brought by the Beach family after the crash. Paul Murdaugh’s behavior allegedly continued even after he was charged, while his family fought the Beach’s lawsuit. Then Paul Murdaugh was killed. It’s unclear how his prior actions fit into his murder. Police have announced no suspects or motives. Alex Murdaugh has been labeled as a person of interest in the murders of Paul and Maggie. Since then, the patriarch has been on the receiving end of dozens of lawsuits and criminal charges involving financial wrongdoing. But, according to the latest affidavit, it can all be traced back to drinks on a boat and a family that allowed binge drinking to occur.",U.S./Hilton Head Island Packet,Ex-girlfriend says Paul Murdaugh’s parents enabled binge drinking prior to SC boat crash,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-girlfriend-says-paul-murdaugh-195501460.html
5/6/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan should do more for peaceful diplomacy with China and not just focus on arms deterrence as tensions rise around Taiwan to the west of Okinawa, said the southern island prefecture's governor Friday, demanding further reduction of its security burden and its risk hosting U.S. military there. “We are strongly alarmed,” Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki said, by discussions at parliament about a potential Taiwan emergency — particularly on the premise that Okinawa would be embroiled because of its relative closeness 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of Taiwan across the East China Sea. Tamaki was speaking online from the prefectural capital of Naha ahead Okinawa's 50th anniversary of its reversion to Japan on May 15, which came 20 years after most of Japan regained independence from the post-war U.S. occupation of 1945-1952. Instead of celebratory mood, there is concern on Okinawa, with its heavy burden of hosting American troops amid escalating tension in the region over China’s increasingly assertive military actions and rivalry with the United States. There is also concern that Russian invasion of Ukraine may embolden China. In what it calls a warning to Taiwan independence supporters and their foreign allies, China has been staging threatening exercises and flying military planes near the island’s airspace, including on Feb. 24, the day Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. Despite that, Chinese officials including leader Xi Jinping say they are committed to using peaceful means to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. The U.S. has consistently expressed its support for ensuring that Taiwan can defend itself, and Chinese military action against the island in the short- to medium-term is generally considered a remote possibility. But the ongoing tension has rekindled fears among Okinawans that they may be sacrificed again by mainland Japan, as in the Battle of Okinawa that killed some 200,000 people, half of them local civilians. “Any escalation of problems over the Taiwan Strait and the contingency of Okinawa being a target of attack must never happen or be allowed to happen,” Tamaki said. Noting that China is Japan's biggest trade partner and Japan being China's second-largest, Tamaki said their close economic ties would be indispensable. “I call for the Japanese government to always maintain calm and peaceful diplomacy and dialogue to improve its relations with China, while working toward easing U.S.-China tension,” he said. Okinawa at the time of reversion asked Japan to make it a peaceful island free of military bases. Today, it is still burdened with the majority of about 50,000 U.S. troops and their military facilities in Japan under the bilateral security treaty. Because of the concentration of U.S. military, Okinawa is faced with noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops and their bases on daily basis, Tamaki said. In addition to those “visible problems,"" he said, “there are also the problems hindering economic development of Okinawa and structural problems. That excessive U.S. base burden is still unresolved 50 years after the reversion.” Tamaki urged the government effort to raise awareness of Okinawa's overburden of security that he says should be shared by all of Japan. Okinawa called on Tokyo and Washington last year to gradually halve U.S. military presence on Okinawa, speed up the removal of the Futenma air station from a crowded neighborhood and abandon the ongoing construction of runways at Henoko on the eastern coast, he said. ""Okinawa's burden of the U.S. military bases is a key diplomatic and security issue that concerns all Japanese people. We need to return to the basic principle of sharing the burden throughout Japan,” he added. The biggest sticking point between Okinawa and Tokyo is the central government’s insistence on the relocation of Futenma to Henoko. Japan’s central government says the Henoko plan is the only feasible plan and has been forcing it forward despite yearslong rejection by Okinawan people. While Okinawa's development projects over the past five decades have helped the the economy, the average Okinawan's income has remained the lowest among 47 Japanese prefectures, Tamaki said. If lands taken by the U.S. military are returned to the prefecture for economic use, it would triple Okinawa's U.S. military-related income, Tamaki said. Japan considers China’s military rise as a regional threat and has increasingly shifted its troops to defend southwestern remote islands, including Okinawa and its outer islands, deploying missile defense systems and other facilities, while increasing joint drills with U.S. military and other regional partners.",World/Associated Press,Okinawa seeks Tokyo's help lowering tensions with China,https://news.yahoo.com/okinawa-seeks-tokyos-help-lowering-093615478.html
