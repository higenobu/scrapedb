3/18/2022,"Ben Stokes reflected on one of the most memorable hundreds of his career at the close of day two in Barbados, with the all-rounder putting West Indies to the sword in fine style after a year of personal difficulties. The England vice-captain’s incendiary 120 from 128 balls in Bridgetown was his first century since the passing of his father, Ged, in late 2020. It also hinted at a return to his best form after he took a four-month break from the game last summer and then struggled on his return in Australia. Though keen to heap praise on others – chiefly Joe Root’s latest score of 153 with the bat, a stylish 91 from Dan Lawrence on the opening day and a maiden Test wicket for the debutant, Matthew Fisher – Stokes opened up about the celebration that followed his 11th Test century. “It was a very special feeling,” said Stokes, after he blitzed 11 fours and six sixes. “Of the hundreds I’ve got personally, that’s probably one of the more memorable ones with everything that’s gone on over the last 18 months. “I got 99 in India last year and it was a bit of a dagger in the heart but it was nice to get there and remember [his father] that way. I don’t like to speak selfishly but it was a nice feeling to look up to the sky.” Stokes was typically positive about England’s prospects when West Indies resume on 71 for one this morning, 436 runs in arrears. This was prompted by a couple of balls from Jack Leach that misbehaved, including a grubber that saw Shamarh Brooks given out lbw on the field, only for it to be overturned due to an inside edge. He added: “We’d have liked a couple more but signs are quite exciting. I don’t want to be eating my words here but I can’t see it getting any better. I think the spinner is in the game and the seamers feel in the game too.” During 150.5 punishing overs in the field for the hosts there was at least a milestone for Kemar Roach to remember, with the wicket of Joe Root the 236th of his Test career. Only six West Indian bowlers have taken more, the 33-year-old having now overtaken his fellow Bajan, Sir Garfield Sobers, on home soil. “It’s amazing,” said Roach. “It’s good to be among the greats. “To write my name on the wall above Sir Garry is a fantastic achievement. There’s no better place to do it, this is the home of cricket in the Caribbean.”",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes remembers late father after ‘special’ century against West Indies ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/england-ben-stokes-remembers-late-father-special-century-west-indies
3/18/2022,"A 12-year-old boy has denied carrying out a 10-month burglary spree at prestigious hotels in London and the BBC Television Centre complex, a court heard. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with 14 counts of burglary. His 13-year-old brother, who also cannot be named, is accused of being involved in three of the burglaries between April 2021 and February 2022. The pair pleaded not guilty to all charges at Westminster magistrates court in south London on Thursday. The boys are accused of carrying out burglaries at locations including Claridge’s hotel in Mayfair, the Four Seasons in Park Lane, the Corinthia hotel in Whitehall and the BBC Television Centre complex in White City, including at the offices of retailer the White Company. Due to their age, the siblings from west London were joined in the dock by their mother. The 12-year-old is also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit burglary during the alleged spree. His brother is charged with three counts of burglary between September 2021 and February 2022 and one count of conspiring to commit burglary between April 2021 and February this year. An adult co-defendant, Shane McCarthy, 19, faces 11 charges: nine counts of burglary, one of theft and one of conspiracy to commit burglary between April 2021 and February this year. He also denies all charges. His case was sent to Isleworth crown court where he is due to appear on 14 April. Alan Elias, the magistrate, released him on unconditional bail until then. Elias said: “Before that date, you really, really, really need to stay out of trouble, do you understand?” he asked McCarthy, who nodded. Jonathan Bryan, prosecuting, argued that the boys’ cases should not be sent to the crown court alongside McCarthy’s because of “the disparity in their age” and their “limited” criminal record. Adel Buckingham, defending, welcomed the prosecution’s submission to separate the cases. She said the young brothers both have special needs and “their age and lack of maturity are both important factors to consider”. Elias said: “Having listened to both parties, we are convinced that in the interest of justice this should be separated and there should be a trial in youth court.” The boys were released on bail until 28 March when they will appear at Highbury Corner youth court.",News/UK news,"Brothers, 12 and 13, accused of burglaries at top London hotels",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/brothers-12-and-13-accused-of-burglaries-at-top-london-hotels
3/18/2022,"The Australian government has imposed sanctions on two Russian oligarchs who have assets in the country, after facing questions about why they were omitted from an earlier round of economic measures triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Oleg Deripaska, who has a stake in an alumina refinery in Gladstone, Queensland, run by Rio Tinto, and Viktor Vekselberg, who has an interest in a gas project in the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory, were not among 41 oligarchs and family members hit with sanctions by Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Monday. The head of Ukraine’s embassy in Canberra, Volodymyr Shalkivskiy, said on Wednesday: “We hope that those Russian oligarchs will be included in the next round of sanctions.” Deripaska and Vekselberg were among oligarchs sanctioned by the US in 2018 for reasons including Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, and last week the UK government included Deripaska among seven influential business figures who have had sanctions imposed on them over the war in Ukraine. The Australian government had not ruled out further expanding sanctions to include the pair, but has always insisted it would not speculate on potential targets. An update to Australia’s consolidated sanctions list, published on Friday, shows Deripaska and Vekselberg have been added. In addition, several Russian banking entities and the country’s ministry of finance were added to the Australian sanctions list on Friday. As Guardian Australia has previously reported, Vekselberg has an interest in an exploration project in the Beetaloo basin – touted by Scott Morrison’s government as a key part of a gas-led recovery from the Covid crisis – through his shareholding in a London-listed company, Falcon Oil & Gas. Falcon is the junior partner in a joint venture to explore gas tenements with Australia’s Origin Energy. Vekselberg’s representative on the Falcon board, Maxim Mayorets, stepped down on 1 March. At the time, Origin said it had raised concerns about Vekselberg’s 16% stake in Falcon with the company. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The EN+ Group, a company founded by Deripaska, owns 20% of Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL), which operates a plant in Gladstone that refines bauxite into alumina. The remainder of the shares are owned by Rio Tinto. Deripaska formerly controlled EN+, but after he was hit with sanctions by the US in 2018 he reduced his stake to 45% so that it was not captured by the measures against him. Rio Tinto and an EN+ subsidiary, Rusal, pay QAL to refine the bauxite in proportion to their ownership of the plant. Rusal also buys its share of the bauxite refined by QAL from Rio. In addition, the partners provide debt finance to QAL, also in proportion to their ownership, and in return receive interest payments from the refinery. The federal government is also considering sanctions against the military junta in Myanmar, more than a year after it seized power in a bloody coup – a delay that has frustrated community figures in Australia. Foreign affairs department officials last month consulted community and aid groups about proposals that would allow it to impose sanctions on members of the junta, their families and the state-owned enterprises that help to finance the regime. A fortnight ago the government put the new regulations in place, allowing it additional options for sanctions targeting the junta and its interests. “As far as I know, the minister of foreign affairs and Dfat are reviewing the sanctions,” said Tun Aung Shwe, the representative in Australia of the National Unity Government (NUG) – a government-in-exile formed after last February’s coup. “I do think they are now preparing but I haven’t heard about the extent of any sanctions,” he said. He said he had consistently advocated for targeted sanctions against the junta on behalf of the NUG since being appointed its Australian representative in July last year and was frustrated by the lack of progress. “Then when I saw the Australian government’s response to the crisis in Ukraine, overnight the Australian government imposed targeted sanctions on the Putin regime,” he said. “Why not for Myanmar?”",News/Australia news,Australian government extends sanctions to Russian oligarchs Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/australian-government-extends-sanctions-to-russian-oligarchs-oleg-deripaska-and-viktor-vekselberg
3/18/2022,"This will go down as one of the greatest wins in West Ham’s history. It was an occasion to rival the night they said farewell to Upton Park and it could not have been more fitting that the decisive touch came from Andriy Yarmolenko, who was the calmest person in the stadium when the ball fell to him in front of goal with eight minutes of extra time left. They were all off the bench when Yarmolenko put the rebound away after Sevilla’s goalkeeper, Bono, pushed Pablo Fornals’s shot into his path. The noise, the sheer emotion, took the breath away. This crowd had seen Yarmolenko mark his return from compassionate leave with a goalscoring cameo against Aston Villa last weekend and now they had witnessed the Ukrainian provide another moment of incredible drama, sending West Ham through to the last eight of the Europa League by overturning a first-leg deficit to beat Sevilla. West Ham had not experienced anything as big as this since moving to Stratford in 2016. It was a night that called for perfection from all of Moyes’s players and it helped that the home fans knew they had a part to play, the ground a wall of noise as the game began and the hosts pushed forward in search of the goal that would draw them level on aggregate. Yet Sevilla, streetwise and organised, had seen it all before. Nobody can match their expertise in this competition and they were not surprised by West Ham’s early robustness. Jules Koundé and Nemanja Gudelj were ready to battle with Michail Antonio, who was available to start after shaking off a groin problem, and West Ham struggled to create much at first. Their threat was limited to set-pieces and their best moment during the opening 20 minutes was a half-chance for Pablo Fornals. There was a discipline to Sevilla, who were boosted by the return of Thomas Delaney, Ivan Rakitic and Anthony Martial, and they soon began to create chances. Jesús Navas shot over from 20 yards and the opener looked certain to arrive when Martial cleverly released Ludwig Augustinsson on the left, only for Alphonse Areola to deny Youssef En-Nesyri with a magnificent save. West Ham breathed a sigh of relief and soon hit back. Moments later Saïd Benrahma pushed a deft pass through to Antonio, anticipation rising until Koundé charged across to take the pace off the striker’s shot. Bono was able to make the save and the danger passed when Gudelj beat Soucek to the rebound. Yet it was encouraging for the hosts. Declan Rice began to exert himself in midfield. Benrahma, lively on the left, grew in influence. After 39 minutes the Algerian linked with Antonio, who showed the unselfish side to his game by driving past a clutch of defenders before moving left and crossing to the far post. It was a lovely ball and Soucek, who had pulled on to Augustinsson, rose above the left-back and guided a fine header beyond Bono. The noise was extraordinary when the ball went in and Sevilla took a while to regain control. En-Nesyri complained bitterly after being roughed up by Craig Dawson and the Sevilla forward was furious with himself after wasting a good headed chance. Back came West Ham, Rice storming through at the start of the second half, Bono saving smartly from Soucek. Increasingly uncomfortable, Sevilla realised that they had to slow the pace of the game. The Spaniards began to weave pretty patterns and they went close again when En-Nesyri lashed wide. The tension was growing, with neither side on top for long. West Ham were not overawed and they had a glorious chance just after the hour, only for Bono to repel them with a cracking double save from Manuel Lanzini. Soon it was Sevilla’s turn, En-Nesyri teeing up Jesus Corona to fire wastefully over from just inside the area. It seemed that West Ham had run out of steam. They needed a spark from somewhere, fresh ideas, but Moyes was short of gamechangers on the bench and it became nervy as West Ham sat back and absorbed pressure, Dawson and Kurt Zouma heading plenty of dangerous crosses from Sevilla away. Extra time beckoned, West Ham bringing on Yarmolenko for Benrhama, a ruthless touch still eluding both sides. West Ham thought they had it when a corner reached Soucek; he headed agonisingly wide. And then it happened. Fornals cut in from the left and shot. Bono tipped it away and Yarmolenko was there to convert the rebound.",Sport/Football,Yarmolenko strikes in extra time to sink Sevilla and send West Ham through,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/west-ham-sevilla-europa-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report
3/18/2022,"Gareth Southgate has described his decision to drop Marcus Rashford, continue to exclude Jadon Sancho and keep faith in Harry Maguire as “fairly straightforward” as he reflected on his squad announcement for the Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast. The England manager has given a first call-up to the Crystal Palace centre-half Marc Guéhi, recalled the Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope and the Arsenal centre-half Ben White and omitted Kyle Walker, although he said the Manchester City defender would return for June’s Nations League ties. It was the status of Rashford, Sancho and Maguire – the Manchester United trio – that dominated the discussion. Rashford and Maguire are in dreadful form but Southgate said it had never crossed his mind not to select the latter, mainly because the centre-half has been so dependable for him over the past four years. It felt a little pointed when Southgate referenced how Rashford had regularly withdrawn from squads since the beginning of last season. According to Southgate, Sancho has been “better” for United of late, having struggled to settle after his £73m move from Borussia Dortmund last summer. But he still remains behind a clutch of wide attacking players, including Emile Smith Rowe, who has scored nine Premier League goals for Arsenal and has retained his place in Southgate’s squad for the games on 26 and 29 March. Southgate has spoken to Rashford but he said that he wanted to meet him face-to-face after the camp. The forward has made eight appearances for England since November 2019, totalling only 320 minutes. “From time to time I do go and do that with players [meet them], especially when a player is with us as often as he [Rashford] has been over a period of four years,” Southgate said. “But in the last eight squads, he has ended up pulling out of five [actually six] while Maguire has been in the team and a key part of the team for massive matches over a long period of time. “For various reasons, Marcus has dropped out of that a little bit. We have players in that area of the pitch playing at a better level, so it is harsh but that is the nature of elite sport unfortunately.” It was put to Southgate that he had made some big decisions with his selection. “I don’t think they are big decisions, really,” he replied. “I think they’ve been fairly straightforward.” Rashford has scored only twice for United since November, has lost his place in the starting XI and is considering his future at the club. The 24-year-old remains his own harshest critic and Southgate suggested that the answers had to come from within. “Marcus is very realistic,” Southgate said. “He will be searching as much as anybody to get that form back. It is important, perhaps after this camp, for me to go and sit with him and find out a bit more what is going on. But also there is a reality that we are not working with him every day so there is a limit to what that is probably going to achieve. “Ultimately there is a big responsibility for any player. I often hear that this coach or that coach has got the best out of somebody but the very best players play well for pretty much every coach they play for. Always as a player you look at yourself first.” Maguire, who has struggled for form at various points during the season, endured a new low on Tuesday when the Old Trafford crowd cheered his substitution in the Champions League exit against Atlético Madrid.

I’m not sure who else would be coming in to play at a higher level who we could really hang our hat on in a World Cup situation [at the end of the year]. I’ve got great faith that we can get him into a structure to accentuate his considerable strengths and protect, like all players, the areas where they need protecting.”",Sport/Football,"England drop for Marcus Rashford not ‘big decision’, says Gareth Southgate",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/marcus-rashford-dropped-england-squad-jadon-sancho-gareth-southgate-marc-guehi
3/18/2022,"When the reaction of so many people within rugby league - a sport which never fails to divide opinion - to an incident is almost unanimous, you know you have a talking point on your hands. The Rugby Football League have made it their intention to crack down on late tackles this season more than ever before, underlined by the spate of yellow cards and suspensions we have seen handed out in the first month of the new Super League season. Here, that issue was shone under the spotlight once again. There is nothing concrete to suggest Castleford would have avoided a fifth defeat in six games, their worst start to a season in a decade, had Mahe Fonua not become the latest victim of laws many feel are overzealous and simply too harsh on the players. But the facts are that Fonua’s yellow card led to a ten-minute period when Wigan had a man advantage, and they certainly exploited it. A 10-6 half-time lead quickly became 22-6 and despite a spirited second-half Castleford fightback, they ultimately fell short as Wigan held their nerve for a fifth win in six. The big talking point, however, was the Fonua sin-bin, the latest in a line of incidents which, in any other sense, would have barely merited a penalty. “It’s boxing without being able to throw a punch,” the Castleford coach, Lee Radford, said. “It’s not the game of rugby league. Not what we were brought up on and what we love.” Castleford had their moments in that first half, but a glut of possession on the Wigan line could only yield one try, to Greg Eden. By then, Wigan had scored two of their own, with the outstanding Jai Field - the headline act on any other night - setting up Liam Farrell just after Zak Hardaker crossed against his former club. But the Fonua sin-bin, for a supposed late hit on Field as he visibly attempted a tackle, was decisive. Would Wigan have scored with Fonua still on the field? Perhaps. But their task was made easier without him, and when Ethan Havard crossed, Field then scored a superb solo try. Shortly after Fonua returned, Field was again involved as Farrell scored his second. “His moments of brilliance helped bring the game home,” Peet said of Field, the competition’s outstanding player so far in 2022. But even he could not defend the bizarre sin-binning of Fonua. “I didn’t really see what it was for,” Peet said. “In live I think it was harsh, and seeing it back, I feel it was harsh too.” Castleford rallied late on, with tries from George Griffin, Jake Trueman and Jake Mamo threatening to set up a grandstand finish, but when Brad Martin was sent off for the visitors, it quelled the Tigers’ momentum. From there, Wigan had the wherewithal to close the game out courtesy of two penalties from the boot of Hardaker. However, there is no doubting what the talking point here is once again: and rugby league has to get to grips with it fast.",Sport/Sport,Five-try Wigan fend off late Castleford comeback to win thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/wigan-castleford-super-league-match-report-rugby-league
3/18/2022,"Even the latest goal in a Premier League game for 18 months was not the end of the remarkable, ridiculous drama. As the scorer of over 300 goals, Frank Lampard is sufficiently accustomed to celebrating that he ought to be able to do it safely but Alex Iwobi’s 99th-minute winner prompted such delirium that his manager broke his hand bouncing around in joyful abandon. Lampard’s bones may have cracked but Everton’s season might have been revived on a night abounding with the surreal. Down to 10 men, without a league goal, let alone a victory, since early February, on a run of four straight defeats, they required a rescuer and found an improbable hero. Iwobi ranks among the worst buys of the Farhad Moshiri era but if terrible signings account for their plight, one may have changed the course of their season. For once, they could reflect happily on his £28m move from Arsenal. Three seasons into an Everton career that had only produced top-flight goals against Wolves, Iwobi showed every misfit can have his day. Allan’s dismissal appeared to have ended their chances of victory in a must-win game but then the Nigerian exchanged passes with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and displayed a predatory instinct he has often kept hidden in his time at Goodison Park to slot a shot past Martin Dúbravka. Goodison was euphoric. For Lampard, the agony was to follow the ecstasy. “I did it in the celebrations of the goal,” he said. “I think I just connected with something and then I realised about two minutes later my hand was shaky. My bones must be going soft.” Yet even an Iwobi strike was not the strangest goalmouth action of the night. The reason the game spanned 106 minutes was a lengthy hold-up after a protestor tied himself to a post. It prompted quips he had spent longer in the penalty box than many an Everton attacker while a steward emerged with bolt cutters to remove him. “I have never seen anything like that,” said Eddie Howe. Perhaps Newcastle, the better side before the break, lost their momentum then. “The second half is a big disappointment for us,” Howe said. Yet if quality was rationed, commitment was evident from Everton. Just a third win in 21 league games stemmed from a third clean sheet since September. The recalled Michael Keane showed a solidity he has lacked of late while inspiration stemmed from leaders on and off the pitch. Everton were buoyed by a half-hour talk by chairman Bill Kenwright on Wednesday and a tour de force from their ageing captain. Seamus Coleman won the challenge to set up Iwobi’s goal and provided two of the abiding images, first in outpacing Ryan Fraser to make a last-ditch challenge in the first half. If it was scarcely the quickest race Goodison has witnessed, Coleman was seen sprinting again at the final whistle, hurtling towards the Gwladys Street End in celebration. “He is a legend of this club,” said Lampard. He could claim some of the credit for just his second league win, sending on the influential Calvert-Lewin. Newcastle had their own impact substitute in Allan Saint-Maximin, who was caught by Allan, in a late and cynical challenge. The Brazilian was booked by Craig Pawson, but the card was upgraded to a red after the VAR, Stuart Attwell, instructed him to review the incident on the monitor. “It is a strong yellow,” argued Lampard, who called for specialist VAR officials. Everton could have crumbled. Instead, they were galvanised by a sense of injustice. “We were all waiting for this,” said Lampard. A night of togetherness and fight and spirit. We got what we deserved, against the odds.”",Sport/Football,Ten-man Everton stun Newcastle with Alex Iwobi’s last-gasp winner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/everton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report
3/18/2022,"Day two in Barbados was one to savour for the England supporters who have landed on the island seeking sun and fun. First came a destructive and emotional 11th Test century for Ben Stokes, followed by the sight of Matthew Fisher wheeling away in delight after claiming a wicket with just his second ball on debut. Come stumps, as thoughts turned to evening plans, this combination had left the visitors in the ascendancy. England had declared on 507 for nine after tea, a total built on Joe Root’s eight-hour 153 and Stokes plundering 120 from 128 balls, with West Indies then reaching 71 for one after 27 overs of graft. With a huge slab of runs on the board, shadows lengthening on the outfield and a wall of noise from the stands, this was always going to be a tricky period for the hosts. They were facing a refreshed England attack too, with Fisher and Saqib Mahmood straining for their first bowl in international cricket. Mahmood had to wait, a lively four-over burst arriving before stumps, but Fisher was thrown the new ball and delivered an instant return. Bounding in from the Joel Garner End, the 24-year-old saw his first delivery sliced to the boundary by John Campbell, only for its follow-up to be loosely snicked behind. It was a golden moment for the young Yorkshireman as he pointed skywards in memory of his father, Phil, who died 10 years ago. It was also a bright start overall. During five brisk overs Fisher got good carry and nearly claimed a second when Sharmah Brooks edged millimetres short of slip. The No3 will resume on 31 first thing, with his captain, Kraigg Brathwaite, 28 not out. Whether Root’s bowlers can prise out 19 wickets on this benign pitch remains to be seen but the return of Stokes the destroyer is a boon after a rushed and unsuccessful comeback during the Ashes. It followed a four-month break last year to address both a broken finger and his mental health, with the loss of his father, Ged Stokes, the previous December a contributing factor. Ged, the former rugby league international, was his first thought when he dabbed Jayden Seales for a single that turned 99 into 100 after lunch. Dropping the bat and removing his helmet, Stokes looked to the skies and bent the middle finger on his left hand, denoting the digit his father had amputated during his playing days. Having smoked 11 fours and four sixes by this point, it was a rare moment of peace out in the middle. Things had started sedately, in fairness, Root resuming on 119 and England adding 39 runs to their overnight 244 for three in the first hour. You could sense Stokes was bristling, however. Fresh to the crease after the loss of Dan Lawrence the night before, the account was opened with a sumptuous on-driven four past Seales and a couple more carved square off Kemar Roach. When drinks came he was 22 not out from 44 balls and, it transpired, ready to erupt. Chris Gayle is on the island this week, enjoying himself in the party stand, and what followed out in the middle was straight from the Universe Boss playbook. While Root continued his cool accumulation, Stokes went into overdrive, ransacking Veerasammy Permaul and Alzarri Joseph, threatening a rare century inside a session and sending Gayle’s new friends into raptures. Stokes was particularly disdainful of Permaul’s left-arm spin, reverse-sweeping fours and launching three mighty sixes. The second of these sent the ball onto the roof of the Worrell, Weekes and Walcott Stand before trickling into its gutter, forcing a box of replacements to come out and bringing up his half-century from 73 balls. Barely sated, the left-hander then set about vandalising Joseph’s figures, plundering 20 runs off one over with a hat-trick of cracked fours, two leg byes and an outrageous six heaved down the ground. The salvo also took Stokes past 5,000 Test runs, joining an elite club of all-rounders alongside Jacques Kallis, Ian Botham, Kapil Dev, and Garfield Sobers to ally this with 150-plus wickets. One half-chance came when Stokes was on 58 and Joshua da Silva was slow to spot a stumping opportunity. Instead he went into the break 11 runs short of three figures with Root, scarcely able to suppress his smile at the other end, having quietly brought up his 12th score of 150 or more. West Indies had been as powerless to resist Stokes as their Australian equivalents at Headingley three years ago or the South Africans he took for 258 in Cape Town in 2016. This innings most resembled the latter and, after Roach finally winkled out Root lbw on review, it similarly ended with self-destruction, Stokes holing out when attempting a third straight six off Brathwaite. From 373 for four at the demise of Root, England continued the charge. Frisky cameos from Jonny Bairstow (20), Ben Foakes (33) and Chris Woakes (41) helped them pass the 500-mark for the first time since they compiled 578 all out in Chennai 13 months ago to set up a rare away victory in India. Just one win from 15 Tests has come during the intervening period. Nevertheless, through the class of Root, the returning fire of Stokes and Fisher’s bright arrival, the clouds are beginning to part a fraction.",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes’ England fireworks light up second Test against West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/ben-stokes-england-fireworks-light-up-second-test-against-west-indies

3/18/2022,"A senior Conservative MP has raised concerns about the lack of checks on wealthy Russians donating money to the party, and expressed disbelief at Boris Johnson nominating the son of a former KGB officer for a peerage. Bernard Jenkin said a “change in attitude” was required to improve transparency around attempts to curry favour with politicians.

Jenkin said there was a “problem in political donations” because MPs are only required to declare the name of the benefactor but that the true person or group behind them could remain a mystery. Fresh concerns have been raised about Evgeny Lebedev being given a peerage by Johnson following media reports that said the prime minister overrode intelligence agencies’ security concerns. Johnson dismissed the reports as “simply incorrect” and Lebedev has insisted he is not an “agent of Russia” and claimed to have been subjected to “farcical” Russophobia claims. But Dominic Cummings, a former top adviser in No 10, claimed this week that he was “in the room when the PM was told by Cabinet Office officials that the intelligence services and other parts of the deep state had, let’s say, serious reservations about the PM’s plan”. Revealing his own concerns about the appointment, Jenkin said MPs should work properly to identify the true source of hospitality or donations, rather than just declare the “front organisation” that provided them. According to an official transcript released on Thursday, Jenkin said: “That is far more than the Electoral Commission required, by the way, which is why we end up with all these Russian donors giving money to the Conservative party, and indeed to other parties, because nobody is obliged to say, ‘Who is this guy? What business is he in? Is he, in fact, a crook? You can’t accept money from him.’ “Mind you, he gave a peerage to Lebedev – I can’t believe it. It seems to me that that is part of the change in attitude that is required.” Lebedev, who joined the House of Lords in November 2020 as a crossbencher, said he was “not a security risk to this country, which I love”. Jenkin suggested two lists of countries be drawn up from which MPs could and could not accept hospitality. “The Five Eyes countries are not a risk,” he said, referring to the intelligence alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US. “France – bit of a risk. There are Italy and Germany. When it comes to Russia and China, that is an absolute no-no.” Downing Street was approached for comment. During the session, MPs were warned that all party parliamentary groups (APPGs) – a type of unofficial cross-party organisation focusing on specific causes or countries – were “a very attractively accessible” way for foreign governments to wield power in the UK parliament. Giles said the groups were “relatively unregulated and, crucially, dependant on outside interests for funding and support makes them very easy to engage with”. “Many APPGs will be actively looking for the kind of support that foreign entities and governments would be only too pleased to provide,” she said. “My impression is that current disclosure obligations are relatively superficial … Given how I described how foreign entities tend to operate now, that does not get to the risk, which is at one or two removes from the front person operating. Given how easy it is to set up shell companies and to obfuscate funding sources, I do not think that that goes far enough.” Giles said current declarations about the groups were “relatively superficial” and that she had a “top 10” of APPGs she was interested in. But she added: “There are so many APPGs and they are so unregulated that it would be difficult to make headway even if you had unlimited resource.” The House of Lords appointment commission was encouraged by Labour leader Keir Starmer this week to review Lebedev’s peerage and publish the advice it gave about the appointment to Johnson. But the commission’s chair, Lord Bew, said on Thursday that he had “no role in assessing the propriety of sitting lords” and added: “Although the commission seeks to be as transparent as possible about its criteria and processes, its formal advice to the prime minister is confidential.”",News/Politics,Senior Tory MP warns about lack of checks on wealthy Russian donors,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/senior-tory-mp-warns-about-lack-of-checks-on-wealthy-russian-donors
3/18/2022,"Baker Mayfield’s career with the Cleveland Browns could be coming to a messy end after the quarterback demanded a trade away from the team that selected him as the No 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft. “It’s in the mutual interest of both sides for us to move on,” Mayfield told ESPN’s Adam Schefter on Thursday. “The relationship is too far gone to mend. It’s in the best interests of both sides to move on.” Baker Mayfield just told ESPN: “It’s in the mutual interest of both sides for us to move on. The relationship is too far fine to mend. It’s in the best interests of both sides to move on.” Mayfield’s comments came the day after the Browns met with Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson to see if he would be interested in a trade to Cleveland. Watson is understood to have rebuffed the Browns. Cleveland now appear to have alienated Mayfield, who has no wish to continue with a team where he was considered expendable earlier this week. Watson is reported to still be a target for the New Orleans Saints, Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers. #Browns have told Baker Mayfield's agent they are NOT accomodating his request, a league source tells clevelanddotcom Mayfield may be stuck in Cleveland for the time being though. On Thursday, ESPN’s Jake Trotter reported the team told Mayfield that they “are not accommodating his request”. That could change if the Browns receive an enticing trade offer for the 26-year-old. The Indianapolis Colts, who recently traded Carson Wentz to the Washington Commanders, could be one option for Mayfield. On Tuesday night, after news of the Browns’ interest in Watson emerged, Mayfield wrote a thank you note to Cleveland fans on social media, in what many interpreted as a farewell note. “Cleveland will always be a part of Emily [Mayfield’s wife] and my story,” he wrote. “And we will always be thankful for the impact it has had and will have in our lives.” While Mayfield has hardly been a failure in Cleveland, the Browns have not made a deep playoff run with him under center despite having a team packed with talent on both sides of the ball. The 2021 season was particularly disappointing, with the Browns failing to make the postseason and Mayfield struggling after suffering an injury in his non-throwing shoulder.

3/18/2022,"The leftwing Congressional Progressive Caucus unveiled its highly anticipated list of suggested executive orders on Thursday, outlining a strategy for Joe Biden to advance Democrats’ policy priorities in the US while much of his legislative agenda has stalled on Capitol Hill. The move reflects pressure from the left of the Democratic party to try to keep Biden pushing an ambitious program of action, despite setbacks and as November’s midterm elections are widely expected to favor a resurgent Republican party. The list covers a wide range of progressive wishlist items, including lowering healthcare costs, canceling federal student loan debt and reducing America’s dependence on fossil fuels. The agenda also calls for raising wages by increasing the threshold to be eligible for overtime pay and reducing police violence by establishing national standards for law enforcement officers. “Taken together, these actions will have an immediate and meaningful impact on people’s lives: lowering costs and raising wages for working people to provide urgently needed economic relief, advancing racial and gender equity by investing in communities that have historically been neglected, and delivering on our promises,” said Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, chair of the CPC. The list was crafted in consultation with the 98 members of the CPC, as well as a number of progressive grassroots groups. Dozens of progressive organizations have endorsed the agenda, calling on Biden to act quickly to sign the suggested executive orders. “As we face a historic crossroad in the fight to protect democracy and defeat white supremacy, it’s beyond time for Biden to use the full powers of the presidency to deliver for the people who elected him and address the interlocking crises of our times,” said Lauren Maunus, advocacy director for the climate group Sunrise Movement. “If he doesn’t, Biden risks not only alienating his own base, but failing to stop the worst of the climate crisis while he had the chance.” Jayapal said the CPC and the White House have had many conversations over the past several months as the caucus worked to develop its list, with the hope of avoiding potential legal challenges to the orders. Jayapal told reporters she planned to discuss the newly released agenda with Biden as early as this week. “The reason it took us so long to put this together, from when we first started talking about it at the end of December, is because we did want to make sure that these are things that the White House can do,” Jayapal said on a press call on Thursday. If Biden takes the CPC’s advice and signs more executive orders in the coming months, they believe it could help Democrats’ prospects in the midterm elections this November. As of now, Republicans are heavily favored to retake control of the House and possibly the Senate as well. With the Build Back Better Act stalled in the Senate, executive action may be Democrats’ best hope of enacting meaningful change between now and November, making it easier for members to campaign for re-election. “If we cancel student debt, that would be a huge thing all across this country,” the progressive Congresswoman Cori Bush said on Thursday. “We keep saying that Democrats deliver, but people don’t know we’re delivering if they can’t feel that difference, and people need to feel the difference.” Jayapal emphasized progressives were not giving up on implementing portions of the Build Back Better Act, the $1.7tn spending package that includes significant investments in healthcare, childcare and climate-related initiatives. But she argued the executive orders proposed by the CPC could provide immediate aid to families struggling to financially recover from the coronavirus pandemic, while also boosting Democrats’ midterm prospects. “We’ve got to make sure that we’re addressing the increase in housing costs, in childcare, in gas prices, and all the things that we’re seeing right now – and addressing that for people who are on the margins,” Jayapal said. “Let’s deliver some relief quickly for people. And yes, anything we do between now and November helps us.”",News/US news,Progressive Democrats set out list of executive orders to push Biden agenda,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/democrats-progressives-executive-orders-list-biden
3/18/2022,"The Australian government’s planned appointment of the foreign affairs minister’s chief of staff to the helm of an influential policy thinktank is yet to be approved, amid speculation the official was not the preferred candidate. The delay in appointing Marise Payne’s top adviser, Justin Bassi, to lead the government-funded Australian Strategic Policy Institute has prompted Labor to warn against “a political captain’s call” on the eve of the election. The Australian reported in December that Bassi, a foreign policy hawk who also previously advised Malcolm Turnbull, was “set to be named” as head of ASPI. It reported the defence minister, Peter Dutton, had recommended the appointment to Scott Morrison’s cabinet. However, Guardian Australia understands Bassi was not the preferred candidate of all of the members of the ASPI council, and that there have been ongoing discussions between the chair, former army chief Kenneth Gillespie and Dutton’s office on the matter. A Defence spokesperson confirmed the appointment process was not yet finalised. “A process is underway to appoint a new executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute … and a decision will be announced when the process has been completed,” the spokesperson said on Thursday night. Dutton’s office responded with a similar comment. Neither Dutton’s office nor Defence answered direct questions about whether the government would make an appointment that is consistent with advice from ASPI or the department. They also did not explain why it was taking so long to formalise the replacement for the incumbent executive director, Peter Jennings, who is due to finish up next month. Labor’s defence spokesperson, Brendan O’Connor, called on the government to rule out a pre-election political decision. “There is no greater responsibility than the security of our nation, and part of that is restoring the integrity, trust and transparency of our institutions,” O’Connor said. O’Connor submitted freedom of information applications to both the department and to Dutton’s office in late December seeking all documents related to the selection of the new executive director, including correspondence with ASPI. Both decisions are overdue. “Considering the appointment for ASPI’s CEO is imminent and we are on the eve of an election, the defence minister has an obligation to respond to the FOI request and demonstrate that a candidate recommended by an apolitical body has not been overlooked in favour of a political captain’s call,” O’Connor said. Government insiders are acting on the assumption that Bassi will be formally appointed, although he may stay in Payne’s office until the election, due in May. The ASPI council had set up a subcommittee to oversee the selection process in conjunction with a recruitment firm. Several internal contenders had been in the running. In a field of potential candidates to lead the organisation, Bassi had been assessed as suitable for the position, but the preferred candidate is said to be Michael Shoebridge, currently a director of the thinktank’s defence, strategy and national security program. While previous media reports had said the decision would have to go to cabinet, the ASPI constitution is not as definitive, saying the organisation’s directors may appoint a person to the top position “in consultation with the minister” and on terms “as the directors see fit”. The Howard government created ASPI in 2001 to “provide alternative sources of input to government decision-making processes” and to “nourish public debate and understanding”. But it stressed at the time that the organisation should operate independently of government, with ministers believing “the perception as well as the reality of that independence would need to be carefully maintained”. According to the Howard government’s charter letter, ASPI should also “take steps to avoid becoming identified with any narrowly defined lines of thought on specific issues, and attention should be paid to publishing a range of views on contentious topics”. In recent years, ASPI has taken on a prominent role in public debate about how Australia should position itself relative to a more assertive China, and Jennings has been a prominent voice calling for a Chinese company to be stripped of the long-term lease over the Port of Darwin. The organisation has attracted the ire of Beijing, particularly for its research documenting human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The now-infamous list of grievances issued by the Chinese embassy in 2020 included criticism of the Australian government for funding what it called an “anti-China thinktank”. More than half of ASPI’s funding comes from either the Department of Defence or other federal government agencies. Defence has earmarked $20m in total funding for the period 2018 to 2023. Last year the government poured in an extra $5m to allow ASPI to set up another office in Washington DC. A portion of ASPI’s funding also comes from defence contractors. The organisation has always insisted that it is transparent about its funding but it “remains independent in the content of our research and in all editorial judgements”. Bassi, who also previously held a senior role at the Office of National Intelligence, is credited with driving the government’s increasingly firm policies on foreign influence and interference and cybersecurity. Payne’s office was contacted to offer Bassi an opportunity to comment.",News/Australia news,Labor warns against ‘political captain’s call’ as Dutton’s choice to head defence thinktank delayed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/labor-warns-against-political-captains-call-as-duttons-choice-to-head-defence-thinktank-delayed
3/18/2022,"Rising numbers of people entering hospital with Covid are leading to other patients becoming infected, staff absences, delayed operations and long waits in emergency departments, experts have said. In recent weeks, Covid infection levels have been rising in the UK and hospitalisations are also increasing. The number of people in hospital with Covid in Devon has doubled in a fortnight and is higher than at any other point in the pandemic, according to the NHS Devon clinical commissioning group (CCG). “The last time Covid-19 numbers were this high was in January 2021, before most people had the benefit of Covid-19 vaccines,” it said in a statement. While far fewer Covid patients were in intensive care, the rise in patients with Covid was having a significant impact, it said. “Many people have tested positive for Covid-19 while in hospital for other conditions, and this has led to patients who are already vulnerable becoming more unwell and also impacted on the ability to admit other patients.” According to data for England, the number of people in hospital with Covid increased from 8,210 on 3 March to 11,346 on Thursday. Meanwhile, data released by the UK Health Security Agency on Thursday revealed that the overall weekly hospital admission rate in England for Covid in the week ending 13 March was 13.38 per 100,000 compared with 11.67 per 100,000 the previous week. The highest rates were in the south-east and south-west, at 19.31 and 19.30 per 100,000 respectively, with the West Midlands the only region in England to show a decline. The highest admission rate was among those aged 85 and older. While rising infection levels in the community mean the number of people in hospital who have an “incidental” Covid infection is likely to be rising, the number of those who are being treated primarily for Covid rose from 3,445 on 3 March to 4,475 on 15 March, according to NHS England. In addition, analysts have suggested hospital-acquired Covid infections are rising. Ian Currie, the medical director of Torbay and South Devon NHS foundation trust, said: “While it is encouraging that the majority of our patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 are in hospital for other conditions and are asymptomatic or experiencing mild symptoms, the impact that the presence of Covid-19 has in our hospitals is really significant. “Under current infection prevention and control guidelines, one patient testing positive for Covid-19 can result in the closure of the whole ward, meaning that beds are unavailable for emergency admissions and for planned operations. This means people waiting longer for treatment in the community and operations being cancelled or postponed and long waits in emergency departments for people needing a hospital bed.” Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, told the Guardian the situation was continuing to deteriorate. “What we are seeing here is what we’re expecting the rest of the country to be seeing over the next week to 10 days,” said Strain, adding that the pressure on hospital beds had coincided with the rise of the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron. Strain said a key difficulty was in maintaining the option for people to visit patients in hospital. “For now, our solution is we are giving them all the face masks and asking them to do their lateral flow test before they come to visit,” he said. “But of course, when lateral flow tests cease to be free in 10 days’ time, that’s going to be a big issue.” Last week the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS trust announced it would be suspending visiting immediately because of a rise in the number of patients with Covid.",News/World news,"Rise in UK Covid admissions leading to hospital illness, absence and delays",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/17/rise-in-uk-covid-admissions-leading-to-infections-absence-and-delays
3/18/2022,"All the company’s ferry services are currently suspended. P&O normally operates 14 services a day between Dover and Calais, three between Liverpool and Dublin, and seven on the increasingly important freight route between Larne in County Antrim and Cairnryan in Dumfries and Galloway. There is also normally an overnight ferry from Hull to Rotterdam. This has been cancelled, along with all other services. On the Dover-Calais route there is plenty of capacity for those looking to take a car over to France. Rival operator DFDS has ferries running every 40 minutes or so to Calais or Dunkirk. P&O ticket holders are being directed to these services, and DFDS is accepting P&O tickets. In its latest posting, P&O says: “If travelling on our Dover/Calais route please arrive at the port as booked and we will arrange to get you away on an alternative carrier as quickly as possible. Once at the port please make your way to the DFDS check-in booths.” Those hoping to take ferries to Ireland face having to switch ferry company, and to buy a new reservation. Stena Line runs from Cairnryan to Belfast while Irish Ferries operates from Holyhead to Dublin. Those travelling from Hull to Rotterdam face the biggest disruption and longest drives. Stena offers Harwich to the Hook of Holland – the nearest replacement for those needing to travel urgently. P&O will have to refund passengers for crossings not taken. With not many car drivers travelling on ferries right now, the biggest disruption to services will be to truck operators. Queues of trucks have already built up in Kent. The company accounts for about 15% of UK freight movements so some knock-on effects can be expected, and trade to Ireland will be affected. P&O Cruises is owned by Carnival, and is therefore completely unaffected by this. P&O has said the disruption will last several days. It is unclear how long it will take the company to remove existing staff who are understandably furious at their treatment. The RMT union has instructed members to stay onboard their vessels once they have docked or risk being “locked out” of their jobs. “We are digging in for the long haul. We are determined to fight,” RMT spokesperson Geoff Martin said. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen how long it takes the company to train up the new agency staff that have reportedly been brought in to replace them. If other support workers at the affected docks refuse to work with the company, this could easily escalate into a protracted dispute. The company is still trading, and has made it very clear that it is not going into liquidation. In theory this means nothing has changed and the company should honour your summer booking and allow passengers to use credit vouchers that they accepted in lieu of cancelled trips last year. If the company did collapse, future reservation and voucher holders would then face a battle to recoup their funds. Travel insurers and credit card companies would be expected to step in for some (but not all) customers. Possibly. Passengers who booked the company’s most expensive Fully Flexi, and the medium priced Standard Flexi tickets are refundable, meaning passengers could cancel without financial penalty. Those who booked the cheapest Saver tickets are stuck with non-refundable tickets. There would be nothing to stop you cancelling but it would be at your expense. It is highly likely. By Thursday afternoon many had expressed their outrage on Twitter. Car drivers are important, but for a boycott to really have an effect it would have to include freight operators. They typically care less for employee rights but equally many will be frustrated at the way the company has gone about this.

3/18/2022,"This radical reimagining of Jonathan Swift’s 18th-century tale of a shipwrecked surgeon is less a biting social satire and more a journey into imagination and fantasy as a refuge from the real world. Writer Lulu Raczka revives Lemuel Gulliver as a student whose mother is seriously ill, and who decides to be “someone else” to escape her pain through make-believe. So she imaginatively enacts the voyages that comprise Swift’s four-part book from the confines of her bedroom. Directed by Jaz Woodcock-Stewart, there is a lovely, scrappy form of storytelling here as scenes are quickly created and dismantled before our eyes, often with bewitching use ofvideo and projections. An enormous back screen resembles a white sheet pinned up against a nursery wall. The video design by Jack Phelan is thrilling, and perspectives are changed with the use of cameras, model figures, a doll’s house for the Lilliputians and clever camera angles for the giants in Brobdingnag, plus a host of other tricks on Rosanna Vize’s ingenious set. A water-filled tank becomes a sloshing ocean storm for Gulliver’s first shipwreck and the special effects become more sophisticated yet never lose their charming DIY quality. The technical games occasionally distract from the story’s emotional grip but at other times it all comes together. Both the script and performances are full of delightful humour. The musical composition by Ben and Max Ringham, and sound design by Owen Crouch, combine with the projection and movement so magnificently that the show feels most energised in these moments. But the spoken drama feels like an interruption or anticlimax against this spectacle, and the technical inventions distract from the emotional grip of the story, although the script and performance are full of humour. Its pace flags a little and it ends up feeling drawn out, even at an hour and a half. Too long is spent in Lilliput, too, with the same games played around scale. It becomes more surreal as it leaves Brobdingnag and enters Laputa, whose society appears complicated and opaque, with scenes cutting away quickly so it is not easy to make sense of it all for a younger audience. But this section is darker and pacier, the shadowy, haunted set evocative. There is a brush with the Houyhnhnms (or horses) of Gulliver’s final voyage, though this world is only glimpsed, with no sign of the Yahoos. Leah Brotherhead, Mae Munuo, Sam Swann and Jacoba Williams form a strong ensemble as joint storytellers and characters. Munuo leads as a lovable Gulliver and has a great singing voice to boot, while the others double up as the motley characters she meets. Gulliver’s musings about life and death when she is in fear of drowning are beautiful for their dark melancholic interiority, and adults might be left wishing for more of this before the tone snaps back to lightness. But at its high points, it is magnificent – a voyage well worth taking, which could do with a bit of tightening up, but grows with emotional power and punch at the end.

3/18/2022,"Assessment of this Rangers team refuses to get any easier. Domestically in 2022 there have been dropped points against Dundee United, Ross County and Motherwell and a humbling at Celtic Park. Yet this success over Red Star Belgrade, ultimately a comfortable one despite Serbian opportunity – and opportunity, and opportunity – over two legs, takes Rangers to the quarter-finals of a European competition for the first time since 2008. When the previous round’s victory over Borussia Dortmund is factored in, it is wholly legitimate that supporters of Rangers can dare to dream. At the same time, that is, pondering how last season’s Scottish Premiership dominance feels so far away. Their 2008 Uefa Cup run, which ended with them as runners-up, was similar to this in that they played efficient rather than routinely dominant football. There should be no embarrassment attached to that. Rangers’ currency is results, not the painting of pretty patterns. If Ryan Kent grabbed attention by scoring the goal that settled Rangers’ nerves in Belgrade, Allan McGregor is due most of the plaudits. The 40-year-old goalkeeper, who saved a Red Star penalty in the first leg, again produced heroics just as it appeared his teammates may wilt. It is fitting he will make his 100th European appearance for Rangers in a high-profile domain. “At moments where he needs to be there, he is there,” said the Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst of his veteran custodian. “Even at his age, he is important for us.” Red Star’s opening to this game, in front of a raucous home support, looked ominous for Rangers. Mirko Ivanic capitalised on sloppy defending from the visitors to chest down and slam home a Guelor Kanga cross. Rangers had failed to apply any pressure at all on or from a short-corner. McGregor’s first excellent intervention of the night came to deny Ivanic. His second arrived immediately before the interval, with Cristiano Piccini’s curling effort tipped wide. In between those Red Star chances, a mix-up in the Rangers defence afforded Milan Pavkov a clear shot which he completely miscued. Red Star started the second period with renewed vigour. Strangely, their finest opportunity of the night actually had no McGregor involvement at all. Instead, having drawn the goalkeeper and outpaced Calvin Bassey, Ohi Omoijuanfo failed to find Pavkov. Had he done so, Pavkov was staring at an open goal. Rangers seized upon this profligacy. Ryan Kent, who has been criticised for his lack of scoring influence this season, marauded forward to collect a clever Glen Kamara flick. Rather than pass to Alfredo Morelos, the former Liverpool winger took on a shot at goal, which flicked off Aleksandar Dragovic and over Milan Borjan. With more than half an hour to play, the restoration of Rangers’ lead and Red Star’s frustrations in front of goal endorsed the theory this night belonged to the Scottish champions. Ivanic prodded a shot wide. McGregor’s next act was an impressive double save. Red Star did receive the consolation of winning on the night, Kamara having stood on Filippo Falco’s foot inside the penalty area before El Fardou Ben Nabouhane stroked home. That moment, in stoppage time, meant nothing in context of the tie’s outcome. “I’m very proud, it’s a great achievement,” added Van Bronckhorst. “The belief here is only getting stronger.” The Dutchman said attention will immediately turn towards Sunday’s league trip to Dundee. Therein lies the tale of Rangers’ curious year to date. This could yet be a season that delivers so much, or so little.",Sport/Football,Rangers reach Europa League last eight despite Red Star Belgrade defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/red-star-belgrade-rangers-europa-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report
3/18/2022,"Good morning. The west is now supplying Ukraine with a range of military weapons, as six countries accuse Russia of war crimes. Residents in Kyiv have been documenting evidence of possible war crimes at great personal risk. And hundreds of Ukrainians fleeing the conflict are expected to arrive in Australia within the coming days. Russia has been accused by Britain, the US, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway of war crimes in Ukraine, as Paris claimed Vladimir Putin was only pretending to be interested in negotiating a peace deal. The six nations challenged Russia before a UN security council meeting as the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said there was now “very, very strong evidence” of war crimes being committed by Russian forces. The US president, Joe Biden, has announced an $800m package of arms to Ukraine as the west steps up military aid against invading Russia forces. The west’s military assistance to Ukraine began cautiously with helmets and flak jackets but now includes drones that can destroy Russian tanks and artillery from 80km away. The west has repeatedly refused to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine but is now supplying a range of powerful weapons. There is “nowhere on Earth” where people are more at risk than the isolated region of northern Ethiopia, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has urged the world not to forget the humanitarian crisis in Tigray. The UN has been unable to get emergency food supplies into Tigray since mid-December. And while in recent weeks medical supplies have started to trickle in, after a six-month hiatus, the WHO and doctors on the ground have said the amount arriving is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of the population. Often there is not enough fuel to get supplies to where they need to go. Alluding to the Russian invasion of its neighbour, Ghebreyesus said: “Just as we continue to call on Russia to make peace in Ukraine, so we continue to call on Ethiopia and Eritrea to end the blockade, the siege, and allow safe access for humanitarian supplies and workers to save lives.” Motor homes intended for Lismore residents whose houses were inundated in this month’s eastern Australia floods are lying empty because linen and water sources have not been organised, while housing “pods” promised by the New South Wales government are yet to materialise. The measures were announced as part of a temporary housing package last week but, three weeks on from the flood, thousands of locals are still living in evacuation centres due to the lacklustre speed of official support. More than 3,600 homes across the NSW northern rivers have been deemed uninhabitable due to floods by State Emergency Services assessors, and the premier, Dominic Perrottet, has said recovery could take years. Bundaberg mayor and former Queensland LNP minister Jack Dempsey has described the Morrison government as being “obsessed by coal” and out of step with almost everybody on the climate crisis “except the big polluters”. Former chief of the defence force Chris Barrie says defence personnel are not allowed to speak out on the national strategic threats posed by climate change without prior approval from Peter Dutton’s office. About 220 Aboriginal men, women and children were killed in reprisal for the spearing of a prominent pastoralist in Western Australia in 1886, in possibly the biggest and most enduring massacre in WA and Northern Territory history.

3/18/2022,"Joe Biden has selected a new White House Covid-19 response coordinator to help lead the US’s fight against the virus, the US president announced on Thursday. Dr Ashish Jha has been named as the new response coordinator. Jha, who is the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, is a well-known public health expert. In 2014, Jha co-chaired an international investigative commission that looked into the failures of the global response to the Ebola outbreak. “Jha is one of the leading public health experts in America, and a well-known figure to many Americans from his wise and calming presence,” Biden said in a written statement. “As we enter a new moment in the pandemic – executing on my national Covid-19 preparedness plan and managing the ongoing risks from Covid – Dr Jha is the perfect person for the job,” he added. Jha will be replacing Jeff Zients, the current White House Covid-19 response coordinator. Biden praised Zients, calling him “a man of service and an expert manager”. When Biden first appointed Zients 14 months ago, less than 1% of Americans were fully vaccinated, fewer than half of schools across the country were open and the US lacked any at-home Covid tests. Today, nearly 80% of adults are fully vaccinated, over 100 million are boosted, nearly every school is open and hundreds of millions of at-home tests are distributed every month, the president said. “The progress that [Zients] and his team have made is stunning and, even more important, consequential. Lives have been saved. “I will miss his counsel and I’m grateful for his service,” Biden added.",News/World news,Biden names Ashish Jha as new White House Covid-19 response coordinator,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/ashish-jha-covid-response-coordinator
3/18/2022,"Ministers and trade unions have condemned P&O Ferries’ mass sacking of 800 British seafarers to replace them with agency crew as shameful and “completely unacceptable”, amid furious calls for action against the company’s Dubai owners. P&O Ferries’ services could be suspended for up to 10 days, disrupting its cross-Channel and Irish Sea routes, after an extraordinary day in which the operator sacked its entire British seafaring staff without notice. They learned the news of their redundancy via a pre-recorded video message this morning. Politicians on both sides called on the government to act to stop what Labour and trade unions called a “scandalous betrayal”. Staff were told by P&O to discharge passengers and freight before being sent a video message telling them P&O “vessels will be primarily crewed by a third-party crew provider … Your final day of employment is today.” Long-serving crew were removed from ships by security guards in Dover, Kent, and in Larne, near Belfast. Replacement agency workers, typically a cheaper option and believed to have been recruited in the UK and Europe, had already boarded some vessels in Dover on Thursday afternoon. Unions had instructed members to stay onboard as they demanded urgent government intervention, but by the evening the potential for prolonged standoffs ended, when crew in Hull left their ship. Earlier, the Dutch captain of P&O’s Pride of Hull had supported crew who refused to leave. In Dover, one 46-year-old crew member of 30 years’ service, said he was worried about how he would support his family. He said: “There were grown men in tears worrying what to do about their mortgages. We’ve been treated abysmally. This was planned for ages; it’s not off the hoof.” Legal experts raised questions about whether there had been a breach of employment laws, which stipulate that any employer planning to sack more than 100 staff must give ministers 45 days’ notice. The government said it was given no notice of the plans. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “The way these workers were informed was completely unacceptable. Clearly the way that this was communicated to staff was not right and we have made that clear.” The RMT union’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said it was seeking urgent legal action over “one of the most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations”. Speaking in the Commons, Robert Courts echoed Downing Street’s condemnation of the manner in which P&O crew were fired, saying he was “extremely concerned and frankly angry at the treatment”. The maritime minister added: “Reports of workers being given zero notice and being escorted off their ships while being told that cheaper alternatives will take up their roles shows the insensitive way P&O have approached this issue.” But he stopped short of describing the action as illegal or promising any action, saying: “Their finances are a matter for them alone.” Courts said the supply of critical goods and services should not be affected by the temporary suspension of P&O’s ferries on the Dover-Calais crossing, as well as from Hull to Rotterdam, Liverpool to Dublin, and Cairnryan to Larne, which he said could last a week to 10 days. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said P&O Ferries’ dismissals, including the use of “handcuffed-trained security, some wearing balaclavas, marching British crew off their ships” were “the actions of thugs”. She said it was a scandal that a Dubai-owned company, which had taken British taxpayers’ money during the Covid pandemic, should act in such a way, and demanded the government review DP World’s contracts, including to run freeports in the UK. DP World, one of the largest port operators in the world, is owned by Dubai’s sovereign wealth fund, and chaired by Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who also heads Dubai’s customs authority. The group owns London Gateway port – the centrepiece of the first of the controversial freeports championed by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and established by the government last year. P&O Ferries was given £33m in emergency support by the UK government to ensure freight kept sailing in May 2020, and it also furloughed 1,100 staff with taxpayer help. Conservative MPs joined calls for the government to act. Huw Merriman, the transport select committee chair, said: “The government must do everything it can – including tabling emergency legislation if needed – to ensure that this appalling employment transaction cannot be completed.” The Dover MP, Natalie Elphicke, urged the minister to discuss “what more could be done to hold DP World and P&O Ferries to account for their disgraceful behaviour”. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was deeply concerned at the news. A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said it had to take a “very difficult but necessary decision” to “secure the future viability of our business, which employs an additional 2,200 people, and supports billions in trade in and out of the UK”. They said P&O Ferries was not a viable business in its current state. “We have made a £100m loss year-on-year, which has been covered by our parent [company] DP World. This is not sustainable. Our survival is dependent on making swift and significant changes now.” The maritime union Nautilus International said the news was “a betrayal of British workers”. The head of the European seafarers’ union ETF, Livia Spera, said it was “astonishing that this can happen in a major developed country like the UK”. P&O initially told customers on Twitter that services would be “unable to run for the next few hours” and that port teams would arrange travel via an alternative operator. Cross-Channel ferry passengers and truck drivers were expected to be diverted to DFDS or Eurotunnel services. Passengers on Irish Sea crossings have been sent to Stena Line. But a number of passengers were left stranded and unable to rebook immediately on alternative services on Thursday morning. A driver in Calais due to return to the UK told the PA Media news agency he had been waiting for a ferry since 6am, adding: “More than anything I’m frustrated at the fact nobody from P&O was there to help and advise. I’ve never had such shoddy service from anybody.” DP World bought P&O Ferries for a second time in 2019, for £322m, after selling it earlier in the decade. The business is believed to have been making escalating losses, with the rising cost of diesel adding to disruption from Covid and post-Brexit paperwork in cross-Channel traffic. DP World said it had never taken a dividend from P&O Ferries. DP World has also come under fire for a £146m deficit in the Merchant Navy Ratings pension fund, which includes retired P&O crew. Sources said the taxpayer could be liable for the shortfall if it was left unpaid. DP World last year agreed to sponsor the European golf tour – at a cost of £147m.",News/Business,‘Scandalous betrayal’: MPs condemn P&O Ferries for mass sacking of 800 staff,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/politicians-condemn-p-and-o-ferries-mass-sacking-staff
3/18/2022,"What quiet, splintering performances. Starting as a light-hearted portrait of a charming family, this 1978 play devolves into a deeply felt character study of three individuals pulling unhappily in different directions. Written by German playwright Franz Xaver Kroetz and translated by Estella Schmid and Anthony Vivis, this production of Tom Fool is a gentle exploration of the way money wriggles its way into the existing rifts of everyday life, adding pressure until they crack. At the head of the family is aggravating Otto, a car mechanic played with a remarkable elasticity by Michael Shaeffer, at once utterly proud and deeply unhappy in himself. Putting up with him is Anna Francolini’s unrufflable Martha, longing to find a life beyond housework and orders. Lounging around them is son Ludwig (Jonah Rzeskiewicz), desperate to forge his own path. Kroetz beautifully writes jolts of everyday life in this family, as days are derailed by the ordinary things that worry away at us. These fragments start sparse and comedic, but gain weight as we go on, with work and worth becoming inextricably intertwined. Conversations about money run through every outing and argument, with every single mark accounted for. Special meals out are ruined by fears of being duped by the waiters, and when they watch the royal wedding on television, all Otto can think of is how much it cost. Pride is a key player too, as Ludwig wants to get a job as a bricklayer to start earning his own money, but Otto refuses to let his son become “just” a worker like him; they have to be seen to be going up in the world. When Otto rages and messes up the house, Martha measures the financial damage. Diyan Zora’s production is soft and tactile, with every nervous glance adding to our understanding of the family’s shifting dynamics. On a naturalistic set designed by Zoë Hurwitz, with brown fold-out sofa and ceiling fan, the realism is interrupted with flashes of projected scene titles. These add another touch of humour to the already sharp comedy of their conversations. Tom Fool is an astute realisation of the limits of class, of dissatisfaction, and the failure to achieve childhood dreams. But as the characters focus increasingly on the way their jobs define them in this capitalist world, Martha and Ludwig start to break out of the other boundaries they’re restricted by. Equal parts bleak and funny, Zora has staged a tender portrayal of a finely drawn family struggling to weigh up what their love is worth.

3/18/2022,"A pub that was the setting for a novel by Daphne du Maurier has banned hunts from meeting on its land after 100 years of the practice. The Jamaica Inn in Cornwall – immortalised in the 1936 novel of the same name about smuggling – announced the decision after the East Cornwall Hunt invited the Beaufort Hunt to meet there on Saturday, a move the pub called “extremely ill-advised”. Both hunts said the venue on Bodmin Moor, its staff and customers had been targeted by “activists” online. The Jamaica Inn, which was built in 1750 as a coaching inn for travellers, wrote on Facebook that it had never supported hunting but had allowed “hunts to start from the inn because of the 100-year tradition of doing so”. It said: “Last Saturday the local hunt invited the Beaufort Hunt to join their usual modest gathering which the owner sees as extremely ill-advised. Taking this fully into account and the passionate views of some of the inn’s customers, the owner has decided to no longer allow any future hunt at Jamaica Inn.” The inn’s owner, Allen Jackson, said some people had cancelled hotel and restaurant bookings since Saturday because of the association with hunting. He said that after hunts, “hundreds and hundreds of people, seemingly reasonable and rational, were telling us they were anti the hunt”. Jackson told the BBC: “These were not extreme views but reasonable views. We have always lost money because some people won’t come here because of the association with hunts. There are no pluses, all we get is minuses. They never spent any money here – they never came in. “The hunting fraternity want to make it seem we have been browbeaten and bullied into this decision but it is nothing like that whatsoever.” Chris Luffingham, the director of external affairs at the League Against Cruel Sports, said: “We welcome this move by the landlord to ban hunts from his pub – it ties in with the mood of the general public, the vast majority of whom are sick and tired of this cruel and barbaric activity.” He called on “more businesses across the UK to enhance their ethical credentials by breaking all ties to fox hunts”. The Beaufort Hunt, one of the largest and oldest hunts in the UK, said the decision was “a result of activists targeting a rural business and attacking their customer base”. It added: “We hope the hunting community continues to show support for this local business as they have done for many years.” The East Cornwall Hunt said it understood there had been “an orchestrated attempt online to intimidate pub staff” by “anti-hunt fanatics”.",News/UK news,Jamaica Inn calls time on 100 years of hunts meeting on its land,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/cornish-pub-calls-time-on-100-years-of-hunts-meeting-on-its-land
3/18/2022,"Under the banner of Inclusive Britain, the equalities and levelling up minister, Kemi Badenoch, on Thursday set out a raft of measures (68 in all) aimed at reducing disparities between black and minority ethnic people and the white population. She also committed the government to a new approach to data and language in this area: the term BAME will no longer be used in Whitehall. Instead, more attention will be paid to the specific experiences of different groups. That has raised concerns that broader issues of racism will be overlooked or dismissed. This much was expected, and had been trailed in last year’s report from the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities to which her announcement is the official response. The report earned well-deserved criticism for its Panglossian view of race relations and lack of enthusiasm for the term “institutional racism”. Ms Badenoch’s response marks an improvement on the report itself, although she shares its authors’ determination to take a broadly positive view of multicultural Britain. This week’s news of a grotesquely inappropriate strip search carried out by police on a 15-year-old black girl in an east London school vividly conveys the limitations of this approach. Investigators decided that racism was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the way the girl was treated, and she remains extremely distressed. While the details of this incident are shocking, its basic features are familiar. There is a wealth of evidence, in both individual cases and statistics, revealing racial disparities in experiences and outcomes across all walks of life – education, health, and the criminal justice system. These have been explored in detail by numerous previous government-ordered reports. Of course, there are good things about multicultural Britain and other factors than race that determine life chances. Class, economic and other inequalities overlap in important ways. But minimising racism – whether societal, institutional or individual – will not make it go away. We need to embed understanding of the way it operates – including in organisations such as the police, or in the Home Office’s handling of the Windrush scandal – and not pretend that this is all in the past. The new emphasis on enforcement and litigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission announced by Ms Badenoch could be constructive, if adequately resourced. Currently, the burden of proving discrimination rests heavily on complainants. Her promise to improve alternative provision, where children excluded from school are taught, is also welcome, along with firmer guidance on exclusions. A new model history curriculum could be a useful tool, though not if it becomes another battle in the divisive “war on woke” being promoted by some ministers. Other measures appear vague and unanchored in existing policy. Local panels to scrutinise police, including the use of force and stop and search, are unlikely to build confidence until well-founded concerns about institutional discrimination have been dealt with. There is no sign of the resources that the NHS will need if it is to reduce health inequalities, or of the poverty-reduction strategy that would underpin any serious move in this direction. Educational inequalities are widening rather than narrowing. Against this backdrop, it is hard to believe that “inclusive Britain” will amount to more than warm words.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Tory anti-racism: warm words and denial | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/17/the-guardian-view-on-tory-anti-racism-warm-words-and-denial
3/18/2022,"The European Space Agency has suspended its €1bn (£844m) ExoMars mission, a joint project with Russia that was due to launch a robotic rover in September. Member states of the ESA voted on Thursday to cancel the launch because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “The decision was made that this launch cannot happen, given the current circumstances and especially the sanctions that are imposed by our member states,” said agency director general Josef Aschbacher. “This makes it practically impossible, but also politically impossible to have a launch of [the rover] in September.” The Mars rover, named Rosalind Franklin, was assembled in the UK for a planned launch onboard a Russian rocket. After travelling to Mars on a German-built spacecraft, it would have been shepherded to the surface by a Russian lander. Instead, the rover will be placed in storage for the foreseeable future. The decision was viewed as inevitable but is a significant blow to Europe’s space programme. The next available launch window, based on the alignment of the Earth and Mars, will be 2024, but the technical and political issues may take longer than this to resolve. The Esa has commissioned a feasibility study of how to get ExoMars off the ground without Roscosmos involvement. Working with Nasa is one option and Aschbacher said the US agency had expressed a “strong willingness to support” the mission. Rosalind Franklin is the second stage of the joint European-Russian mission. The first part, a satellite called the Trace Gas Orbiter, was launched in 2016 and is studying the planet’s atmosphere. It was also supposed to act as a telecommunications relay for Rosalind Franklin when the rover arrived. The rover was intended to drill 2m into the surface of Mars to look for signs of life. There are no comparable missions slated in the next decade and the rover should remain viable for several years in storage. However, keeping the mission alive is likely to add significantly to its more than €1bn price tag. The Esa also said on Thursday that five satellite missions expected to be launched by Soyuz had been cancelled after the decision by Roscosmos to withdraw their personnel from Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana. However, Aschbacher said that the situation aboard the International Space Station (ISS) – currently home to four Americans, two Russians, and one German ESA astronaut – remained stable. “Astronauts are working nominally. They are doing well and doing their operations as planned,” he said. Earlier this week, Nasa confirmed that one of its astronauts will still share a ride back from the ISS with two cosmonauts aboard their Soyuz capsule later this month.",News/Science,European Space Agency suspends €1bn Mars mission with Russia ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/17/european-space-agency-suspends-1bn-mars-mission-with-russia
3/18/2022,"Attacks on hospitals and healthcare workers. Escalating strikes claiming the lives of civilians, including children. A growing humanitarian crisis, with vast numbers forced to flee their homes. A flagrant disregard for human life. These terrible scenes are witnessed not only in Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has transfixed the world, but in other wars across the globe that have largely slipped from the public’s attention – in Myanmar, where the military tries to crush resistance to its seizure of power just over a year ago; in Ethiopia, where the prime minister believed he could win a swift victory against the Tigray region’s leaders, but fighting continues 16 months on; in Yemen, riven by conflict since 2014; in Syria, where the war entered its 12th year this week. Ukraine’s war was once in the shadows too: the long-running conflict in the Donbas had been largely forgotten until Russian troops began massing at the country’s borders late last year. In each of these cases, the parallels or connections to what is happening there now go beyond suffering, death and mass displacement. For Syrians in the rebel enclave of Idlib, who saw Russia save Bashar al-Assad, its tactics in Ukraine are painfully recognisable: “Fortify your hospitals with cement blocks; the enemy Putin does not distinguish between civilians, wounded people and fighters,” one medic said. Syrian troops are being recruited to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. In Ethiopia, too, health workers have been attacked and grotesque violations of the laws of war have become the norm: this week a horrifying video emerged on showing armed men burning a Tigrayan man to death in western Ethiopia. As many as half a million people have died from the violence and hunger caused by the war, researchers said this week. In Yemen, more than 4 million people have been displaced, and escalating violence made January the deadliest month for civilians since 2018. The World Food Programme warned it was already forced to take food from the hungry to feed the starving, and might soon be unable to feed even the starving. Yet Wednesday’s UN funding conference raised less than a third of the $4.2bn desperately needed. In Myanmar, military and security forces have committed systematic and widespread abuses, bombarding populated areas with airstrikes and heavy weapons and deliberately targeting civilians. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, on Monday urged the international community to take “concerted, immediate measures” to halt the spiral of violence. Some supporters of the deposed civilian government hope that the unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia will help to make the case for further action against Myanmar’s junta. While the EU recently expanded sanctions to a state-owned oil and gas company, the US has been slow to act. Yet others fear that the conflict in Ukraine will drag away the political attention and resources needed to put the generals under pressure. Meanwhile, aid agencies find the multiple conflicts, the disastrous conditions in Afghanistan and what is described as the worst-ever hunger crisis in South Sudan have left them torn between grim choices. More humanitarian funding is needed, alongside political will and diplomatic energy. The victims of these other wars deserve the same level of support and solidarity rightly seen for the people of Ukraine. Those already too often overlooked must not be pushed further into the shadows.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on forgotten wars: we must not neglect conflict’s other victims | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/17/the-guardian-view-on-forgotten-wars-we-must-not-neglect-conflicts-other-victims
3/18/2022,"A Conservative MP has backed calls for dozens of Marks & Spencer stores across Russia to be shut immediately, suggesting Vladimir Putin is funnelling every rouble made in the country into the invasion of Ukraine. Alicia Kearns, who hosted four Ukrainian parliamentarians in the House of Commons on Thursday, said any profits generated would be tainted by the killings and war crimes committed during the conflict. Two weeks ago, M&S stopped supplying its Turkish franchisee’s businesses in Russia, which has 48 shops and 1,200 employees. However the stores remain open and continue to sell their existing stock. Some other chains that operate in Russia by franchise, such as McDonald’s, have been able to close their doors, given the agreements differ between companies. Alyona Shkrum, a Ukrainian MP who met senior UK government figures including the prime minister, Boris Johnson, on Thursday, called for Britain to put more pressure on firms still operating in Russia. “The UK has been very active in leading – they were one of the first countries with a lot of companies to leave, but there are still three big companies who haven’t left,” she said, adding: “Marks & Spencer has not left Russia.” Shkrum said all money generated in Russia “goes just to the army” and added that there had been several reports of invading troops raping Ukrainian women. Another Ukrainian MP, Maria Mezentseva, added: “Everything that is contributed to the Russians is coming back severely with bloody bullets to innocent Ukrainians.” Kearns backed the call for all M&S shops in Russia to close and raised concern about the reports of “sexual violence” committed by soldiers. Referencing the M&S advertising slogan, she said: “This isn’t just any food, it’s blood and rape food.” Speaking to the Guardian, Kearns added: “It is wrong that some British businesses continue to operate, because all they are doing is buttressing Putin’s brutality and funding his war coffers.” M&S said in a statement that it did not operate stores or have any employees in Russia and the franchise licensee held the rights to trade under the firm’s banner in both Ukraine and Russia. A spokesperson added: “We suspended deliveries to our franchise licensee’s Russian business two weeks ago and have no plans to reinstate them. We are actively discussing the future of the business with our franchise licensee.” Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and chair of the parliamentary group on Russia, told the Commons that other multinational companies still doing business in Russia included the fast food chain Subway and the tax advisory firm Baker Tilly. Subway said it had no corporate operations in Russia and that its 450 franchised restaurants in the country were all independently owned and operated. Baker Tilly International said it would “separate member firms in Russia and Belarus from our global network” and not “serve government clients or state-owned enterprises of Russia or Belarus, or sanctioned entities and individuals”. No 10 reiterated its call on businesses to “do nothing that could potentially support Putin’s regime and indeed do everything to put pressure on him to change course”.",News/World news,Tory MP backs calls for Marks & Spencer stores in Russia to close,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/tory-mp-backs-calls-for-marks-spencer-to-shut-stores-in-russia
3/18/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has vowed to intensify his overhaul of France’s welfare state, tax system and labour market if he wins a second term as president next month, arguing that transforming French society would protect people at a time of crisis when the war in Ukraine marks “a return of tragedy in history”. The 44-year-old centrist leader has risen in the polls since Russia’s invasion and is a clear favourite to win April’s election – which would make him the first French president to win re-election in 20 years. But he has been under pressure from opponents to explain his economic and social policy. “We are at a tipping point where we can make a real difference,” Macron said during a four-hour press conference at a former warehouse in the northern suburbs of Paris, warning of a mix of global crises including Ukraine, the Covid pandemic, climate change and the challenges of self-sufficiency in farming. Macron vowed to step up his changes to the welfare state and the benefits system, raising the pension age and continuing to cut taxes for businesses and households. Brushing aside the potential for widespread street demonstrations, he said people must “work longer” in order to protect France’s generous pensions system. Although Macron has been boosted by his stature on the international scene, voters are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and pollsters fear abstention could be significant if the election is seen as a foregone conclusion. Macron said that if re-elected he would move swiftly to carry out the pensions overhaul that he had failed to put in place in his current mandate. He would gradually increase the pension age from 62 to 65, bringing it into line with countries such as the UK and Germany, while setting a minimum pension rate at €1,100 a month. He said he had “learned the lessons” from his past difficulties. In 2019, Macron’s proposed pensions overhaul sparked protests that lasted longer than any strike since the wildcat workers’ stoppages of 1968, and the measures were shelved during the pandemic. Macron said he would also radically overhaul the unemployment benefits system to push people back to work. This would include requiring unemployed people to undertake 15 to 20 hours of work or training a week. In another politically risky change, all social benefits – for unemployment, housing or childcare – would be centralised in a single system, affecting up to 20 million people. “It’s quite normal, especially when you consider the state of public coffers, that we work more,” he said. Macron has gained five to six points in opinion polls over the past month, and is well ahead of the far-right Marine Le Pen, who is currently in second place. He is favourite to win the first round on 10 April by a wide margin. But it is not clear which candidate will face him in the final round on 24 April. Le Pen is being trailed in the polls by three candidates: the rightwing challenger Valérie Pécresse, the far-right former TV pundit Éric Zemmour and the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose campaign is gaining momentum. Polls show Macron beating all of them. Despite that, Macron remains a divisive figure in France. When he came to power five years ago he was a former banker who had served as economy minister under the left and promised a new kind of “pragmatic” centrist politics that he said would liberalise the economy. He loosened strict labour laws, but his pro-business moves – cutting corporate taxes and transforming the wealth tax into a property tax – swiftly led to him being labelled “president of the rich”, a tag he has struggled to shake off. His reform programme was hit by two major crises. First, the gilets jaunes protest movement over fuel prices that turned into an anti-government revolt. Then the Covid pandemic, which has killed more than 138,000 people in France and exposed strains on the health service. In response, Macron turned to state interventionism and vast public spending. He boasted of “nationalising wages” to keep the country afloat. Macron now faces accusations from critics including Gérard Larcher, the rightwing head of the senate, that he could be re-elected too easily. Larcher said Macron could win re-election “without ever really having been a candidate, without a campaign, without a debate, without a competition between ideas”, leaving questions over his mandate to govern during a second term. Macron angrily brushed aside Larcher’s comments and stood by his record in office. “I promised lower unemployment … despite the crises, we did it,” he said, adding that if re-elected his aim was to wipe out unemployment entirely. He also said France could be one of the first countries to wean itself off fossil fuels, and he wanted to build a “European metaverse” to compete with US tech firms and make Europe more independent. He promised greater protection for children online by increasing regulation of social networks, and a consultation on changes to the education and health systems.",News/World news,Emmanuel Macron vows to step up welfare reforms if re-elected,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/emmanuel-macron-vows-to-step-up-welfare-reforms-if-re-elected
3/18/2022,"Thousands more undergraduates have pulled out of their studies since the start of the academic year, amid suggestions that the pandemic is continuing to take a toll on British universities and students. New figures from the Student Loans Company show that more than 18,000 students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland withdrew from university courses and stopped receiving loans by February this year, an increase of more than 4,000 compared with the same point in 2021, and 3,000 more than in pre-pandemic February 2019. The figures cover full-time and part-time students who have notified the Student Loans Company that they have withdrawn, and excludes those who never started their courses or have been suspended. In England there was a 28% annual increase in withdrawals by the fourth week of February, with the rate increasing as the academic year progressed. Higher education providers in Wales saw a 62% annual increase in withdrawals by late February. The figures come as lecturers and academics said they were seeing higher rates of absence among their students, as many staff and students continued to be affected by Covid. The Department for Education (DfE) cautioned that the SLC’s figures were experimental, open to wide fluctuation, and should be treated with caution. It also noted that the 18,321 withdrawals accounted for less than 1.5% of the more than 1 million undergraduates receiving student finance, based on the SLC’s data for the 2021-22 academic year. Official figures published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) showed that student drop-out rates in 2020-21 were well below those of previous, non-pandemic years. Just 5.3% of UK students who first enrolled in 2019-20 failed to continue their courses in 2020-21, compared with 6.5% or more in each of the previous five years. Michelle Donelan, the minister for higher and further education, said: “I have long argued that when it comes to university, getting on is every bit as important as getting in, and that universities must focus on tackling drop-out rates among students. “That is why it is so greatly welcome to see that for the first time, it is projected over 90% of students will complete a qualification – the highest rate ever recorded.” Based on the 2020-21 continuation rates, the DfE calculates that just 9.4% of full-time first degree entrants in the UK are projected to leave HE with no award. The change was particularly marked in Scotland, where non-continuation rates fell from 7% – above England and Wales – to 4.5% in the space of a year. The Hesa data also showed sharp falls in drop-out rates at some of the worst-affected institutions. The University of Suffolk saw non-continuation rates among school leavers plunge from nearly 25% in 2019 to 13.6% in 2020. Goldsmiths College, University of London, was unusual in seeing its non-continuation rate of young undergraduates continue to rise, from 10% to 11.6%.",News/Education,Thousands of students drop out of university as pandemic takes its toll,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/17/thousands-of-students-drop-out-of-university-as-pandemic-takes-its-toll
3/18/2022,"Ministers have made a U-turn on a pledge to limit the time or earnings on MPs’ second jobs, one of several rule changes promised by Boris Johnson last year in order to stop abuse of the system. The proposed changes were announced after there was a public outcry when the former cabinet minister Owen Paterson was censured for breaching lobbying rules and another, Geoffrey Cox, was found to have been voting by proxy when doing work for law clients in the Caribbean. MPs have objected to some of the proposals which are being considered by the Commons standards committee, including on time limits, declarations of their contracts, and to new rules that would add “respect” as a principle for the MPs’ code of conduct and aim to limit abuse in the chamber. Here are some of the MPs’ views submitted to the committee: Complexity brings errors, which then bring the house into disrepute – contrary to the code’s purpose. Limiting time or limiting income does not improve the honesty and integrity of the system – it just creates more opportunity for errors. The consequences of even the smallest transgression are public and humiliating, both personally and politically. Therefore, it is absolutely worth getting this right. Sadly, this report and consultation I fear leads us in the opposite direction by creating greater complexity, more rules and increased subjectivity. It seems to me that the principal concerns here are about potential conflict of interest and neglect of constituents. Arbitrary limits on time spent on, or reward earned from, outside interests do not necessarily mirror either concern. Time spent as a nurse also has the same impact on time available for constituents as time spent as a hedge fund manager. Again, transparency is the most effective way for constituents to determine whether they find the arrangements of their member of parliament acceptable or not. … The code should be kept as brief as possible and enable MPs to take responsibility for themselves within broad boundaries. The baseline assumption as a new MP seems to be that I am on the scrounge and should be treated like a child and punished at the first opportunity. If we were treated like adults we would be far more likely en masse to act like them. We are not compensated for the huge invasion into our private lives that comes with this job, the security we have to live with, or the abuse we have to tolerate, and that our place of work treats us like young offenders makes the job nearby impossible. The revised system should not disincentivise people who would be an asset to the Commons from applying in the first place, nor encourage those with experience of their field to leave. Equally, any new rules should not reduce the likelihood of those with professional experience seeking to enter the house. Setting an arbitrary time limit on paid and unpaid outside interests would involve the commissioner policing an MP’s personal life and free time. This is not a desirable, nor a practical use of the commissioner’s time, and these matters are almost impossible to police, and could result in vexatious complaints against members. Frankly, I find the politics and personal behaviour of some politicians abhorrent. As an elected representative I have a right to make my opinions about them known, perhaps even a duty to do so. That is why I cannot support your determination to police the comments of MPs in any medium: it might be necessary to express contempt for hateful political positions. The stated intention of this proposal [regarding ‘respect’] is to protect against bullying and harassment in committees and divisions. Clearly, such behaviour would be wholly unacceptable and guarding against it is an entirely worthy aim. However, this proposal has unintended consequences that damage the workings of the house. It is foundational to our parliamentary democracy that we are not subject to investigation and sanction from outside bodies.",News/Politics,‘It’s assumed I am on the scrounge’: MPs’ views on second-job limits,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/its-assumed-i-am-on-the-scrounge-mps-views-on-second-job-limits
3/18/2022,"George Russell has insisted that there is no rivalry with his teammate Lewis Hamilton, as he prepares for his first race as a full-time driver with his new team Mercedes. The 24-year-old from King’s Lynn said he felt only excitement for the challenge ahead in working with Hamilton whom he looked up to as a “superhero” as a child, when he takes to the track for the Formula One season-opener in Bahrain this weekend. Hamilton has multiple championships and is entering his 16th season in F1 and has been world champion seven times, while Russell is very much at the start of his career. He is highly rated and expected to present a genuine challenge to Hamilton but views their relationship as collaborative rather than combative. “We are at different stages of our careers. Lewis has nothing to prove, he is statistically the greatest driver of all time, I think he wants me to succeed and he truly wants to help me,” he said. “It’s incredibly exciting that I find myself in a win-win scenario. You’re going up against the greatest of all time who has beaten everybody. I can only learn from him.” With Mercedes on the back foot, their car suffering from the “porpoising” downforce problem on straights causing the car to bounce violently, Russell insisted the pair were committed to working together as they face strong opposition. “There is really good respect between Lewis and I,” he said. “We both recognise we need to work together to push forward because our competition isn’t with each other, it is against Red Bull, Ferrari, McLaren. If we start battling internally, trying to be secretive about set-ups, it’s not going to benefit anybody. We are all here to win, and beating your teammate is not the sole goal for any of us.” Russell began karting when he was eight in 2006 and a year later Hamilton made his debut in F1. He has been part of the Mercedes junior driver programme since 2017 and toward the end of last season Mercedes signed him to a race seat to replace Valtteri Bottas, a move he admits his younger self would have found hard to believe. “It is surreal in a way,” he said. “When you’re a kid you believe they are superheroes. It’s funny when I look at it now that I am lining up alongside Lewis.” Russell impressed during his three seasons with Williams, repeatedly outperforming the car which was mired at the back of the grid. He was outstanding in wet conditions to take second on the grid at Spa last year and similarly in taking third in qualifying for last year’s Russian GP. He also proved entirely confident in stepping up to the big stage when he stood in for Hamilton, who had contracted Covid, at the Sakhir Grand Prix in 2020. Russell was second on the grid at the Bahrain International Circuit in his first drive for Mercedes and having taken the lead was entirely in command of the race and set for a win until a team pitstop error and then a puncture denied him the top spot. He will have no fears of opening his full-time drive with Mercedes at the circuit where he made such an impression two years ago. Mercedes took a bitter blow to their morale when Lewis Hamilton was denied an eighth title in controversial circumstances at last year’s season finale, according to a pivotal member of the team. Anthony Davidson, the former F1 driver who has been Mercedes’ simulator driver since 2012, witnessed the striking change in atmosphere after the Abu Dhabi result and the steely determination that followed from the team and Hamilton in preparation for this weekend’s Formula One season-opener in Bahrain. Davidson describes a team rocked by Hamilton’s defeat, when the race director, Michael Masi, took decisions under the safety car that allowed Max Verstappen to overtake on the final lap to win the race and drivers’ championship. “I came back in for the first day [after Abu Dhabi] and the atmosphere, well, they were hurting badly, they were bruised. Suddenly the tone had changed,” Davidson said.",Sport/Sport,George Russell looks to be a teammate and not a rival to Lewis Hamilton ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/lewis-hamilton-and-mercedes-driven-by-sting-of-defeat-says-davidson
3/18/2022,"Boris Johnson is understood to be open to accepting an invitation to attend the European Council next week when EU leaders meet to discuss the war in Ukraine, though one has yet to be extended. A Downing Street source said Johnson would be in Brussels next week for a Nato summit, along with the US president, Joe Biden, who will attend the council meeting later that afternoon. They said it remained a possibility for Johnson to attend the council meeting – which would be a major symbolic step post-Brexit. However, the decision on whether to invite Johnson to the EU summit is for the European Council president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium. EU sources said that no such invitation had been sent to Downing Street and that this was not expected to change. A spokesperson for Michel said: “No comment.” Officially, Johnson’s spokesperson said his presence at the summit was not confirmed. “At this stage we haven’t confirmed plans for next week with regards to either the council or Nato,” he said. “We expect he will be attending the Nato summit but at this stage we haven’t confirmed anything. Asked specifically about whether he was considering attending the EU summit, the official added: “I’m not going to speculate. I think we’ve seen throughout this crisis in Ukraine, the invasion of Ukraine, that the UK is working extremely closely with European allies on that.” A precedent for a UK minister to attend special meetings in Brussels was set by Liz Truss earlier this month, when the foreign secretary attended a special meeting of the EU foreign affairs council. The US, Canada, and Ukraine were also invited to attend. Nato leaders will meet in Brussels on 24 March as EU leaders also gather for their regular spring summit, which Biden is also expected to attend. Leaders will convene for a session on security and defence, including humanitarian assistance and refugees, according to the official schedule. Earlier this week, MPs from across the continent voted to expel Russia from the Council of Europe, the continent’s leading human rights organisation, over the invasion of Ukraine. The vote has huge symbolic value, although it became something of a formality after Russia announced earlier on Tuesday that it was quitting.

3/18/2022,"The parents-in-law of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe have joked that their son’s home needed to be tidied as it was in an “appalling” state, and said they hoped to see their daughter-in-law at the weekend. On BBC Breakfast, John Ratcliffe described his son Richard’s home as “appalling”, to which his wife, Barbara, replied: “It is, but if you can think about it, it was a three-bedroom flat when Nazanin got taken and they’d only got a baby in it. Well, that baby’s grown up.” They said Nazanin, Richard and their daughter, Gabriella, would be staying in accommodation provided by the Foreign Office for a couple of days – their own home is full of campaign material and Gabriella’s toys – before spending time with other family at the weekend. The following Sunday Gabriella would be able to give her mother a Mother’s Day card for the first time in her life, according to Richard Ratcliffe. He said their seven-year-old, who does not remember her mother as a free woman, had all her craft equipment ready to start making it. Three years ago he himself laid a card and 155 bunches of flowers – one for each week his wife had been in prison – outside the Iranian embassy in London. It is a modest ambition for a family forced apart by Nazanin’s wrongful six-year detention in Iran, but Ratcliffe said normal was what the family craved. “We can’t take back the time that’s gone. But we live in the future not the past,” he said. “We’ll take it one day at a time. I think it is going to be the beginning of a new life, a normal life and hopefully a happy family, with all the bumps and all the normal squabbles we had before.” He said the first thing Nazanin had said she wanted him to do for her on her return home was to make her a cup of tea. “So we will do that,” he said, adding that as she drank it, she could supervise a bit of tidying up around their flat. “I think, actually, we were looking at the house and it needs a bit of tidying, so there might be a bit of tidying, perhaps directed by mummy.” Clearly lurking at the back of his mind, however, was awareness that normal life is not a simple thing to recapture after the extraordinary experiences that the family have endured. “We’re both in our own way a bit battered, and that won’t play out today but it will manifest in different ways,” he said. “I’m not dwelling on that now, but it lurks at the back of your mind after six years apart: ‘How long will it take to really get back to normal?’” Gabriella, however, seemed to have clear ideas how to reintroduce her mother to her life. Ratcliffe said she had picked out which toys to take to show her mother when her plane landed, and wanted to play the piano for her and show off her craft equipment. “She wanted to show her mummy the things she can do now that she couldn’t before,” he said. According to Nazanin’s sister-in-law, Rebecca Ratcliffe, Gabriella spent Wednesday night sleeping between her parents in the safe house the family have been taken to for a couple of days to give them a chance to adjust. “It’s difficult for [Gabriella] to comprehend,” Rebecca told ITV. “It’s something she’s wanted for a long time but probably doesn’t know how to cope with. I just heard from Richard that [Gabriella] slept in the bed between them all last night. That’s a really special moment for all three of them.”",News/News,"Tea, toys and tidying as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe reunites with family",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-reunited-with-family
3/18/2022,"This week, two years after Black Lives Matter protests prompted by the death of George Floyd, and the prime minister’s promise of an urgent examination into the state of racism in the UK, the government has put forward an action plan in response to the controversial Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (Cred) report. Cred was widely criticised by politicians, journalists, campaigners and the British public for downplaying the prevalence of institutional racism in Britain, to the extent that commission chair Dr Tony Sewell denied there was any evidence of its existence. Not only that, even its commissioners and contributors distanced themselves from its processes, questioned the report’s academic rigour and expressed concern about the tailoring of evidence to conform to a predetermined political narrative. No 10 was alleged to have spent three months rewriting its findings. A working group from the United Nations, an organisation usually defined by diplomatic reserve, went so far as to label the report an attempt to “normalise white supremacy”. Understandably, then, expectations of the response from the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, were low. Matters were scarcely helped when, in her foreword to the action plan, the minister decried “the lazy consensus” around disparity. Perhaps this was the minister attempting to engage compassionately with the 75% of Black and Black British citizens who see discrimination in their everyday lives, whether through their experiences at school, in accessing housing, at work or when engaging with public services and the criminal justice system. In the 97-page plan, the government has committed to revamping the history curriculum for schoolchildren, issuing advice to employers on how to measure and report on ethnicity pay gaps, and clamping down on online racist abuse through new legislation. There are other positive developments, including the recent establishment of the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, which could have real benefits after the disproportionate number of Covid deaths in minority ethnic communities. However, the government could have gone further to improve the parameters by which we assess racial equality, to help achieve more positive outcomes. It would have been a quick win to introduce legislation to make ethnicity pay gap reporting mandatory, as occurred with the gender pay gap in 2017. There is also the problematic issue of the government making progress on the one hand while eroding the rights of minority ethnic communities on the other, not least with a swath of planned restrictive legislation from a combination of the policing, borders and elections bills to an overhaul of the Human Rights Act. In its response to Cred, the plan says: “We do not agree with those who think that lack of opportunity should be seen solely through the prism of ethnic minority disadvantage.” It would seem politically convenient to reduce the struggles of life down to these terms, allowing the government to distract from the need to improve conditions for communities in the UK. I certainly don’t know one member of the minority ethnic working class, including my parents, who would couch their experiences in this language. Our communities are made up of individuals of different ethnicities who all share overlapping commonalities that bind us, including – in addition to class – age, gender, faith and sexual orientation. These identities impact every aspect of our lives in complex ways that move beyond a singular discussion of race. It is on this basis that for more than a decade the Runnymede Trust has been calling for all members of the working class to be offered protections under the Equality Act, regardless of their ethnicity, in acknowledgment of the vulnerabilities that exist across society. There are reasons to be optimistic about the government’s action plan. In much of the offer there is a more conciliatory and considered tone than Cred’s report – which downplayed the impact of racism on inequality and lauded Britain as “a model for other white-majority countries”. Indeed, say it quietly and call me an optimist, but on early review we may even consider the government position a discreet repudiation of some of the more divisive aspects of the Cred report – maybe it is even a calling a truce in the contrived “culture war”, at least in the context of race. In particular, the government response does not appear to make any direct reference to the term “institutional racism”. Cred’s original position on the issue was deeply flawed, with Sewell repeatedly insisting on the record that there was no evidence to support such a concept. I am acutely aware of the timing of the response, in a week in which the Royal Society for Chemistry confirmed that the field has an institutional problem with racism, and that there is only one Black chemistry professor in the entire country. And it’s the same week that a 15-year-old Black girl was reported to have been strip-searched at school by the Metropolitan police without the presence of an appropriate adult, in an incident that the authorities are clear would not have happened had the child been white. And it comes hot on the heels of the revelation that the Cabinet Office reached a six-figure settlement for racial discrimination in a bullying case at the heart of Whitehall, which the former deputy cabinet secretary Dame Helen MacNamara linked to “systemic issues” within our country’s government apparatus. The UK has made great strides towards achieving equality, but as Boris Johnson himself said when launching Cred: “It is no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism. There is much more that we need to do.” As always, I think of future generations in these moments. We owe it to them to act.

3/18/2022,"An inquiry has been launched after an apparent hoax caller claiming to be the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, was able to get through and speak directly to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. After Wallace revealed news of the call on Thursday, Priti Patel said something similar had happened to her earlier in the week. Both government ministers expressed solidarity with Ukraine. A defence source told the Reuters news agency Wallace had ordered an immediate inquiry to find out how the apparent impostor was able to speak to him. The incident raises security questions, particularly as Wallace suggested that Russia was behind the effort. The shadow Home Office minister, Holly Lynch, said: “For individuals to be able to fraudulently gain access to two of the most senior government ministers with responsibilities for our national defence is worrying. “There are questions that need answering as to why the basics in due diligence appear not to have happened, especially at a time of heightened security concerns around disinformation and cyberattacks. “An urgent investigation must look into how this happened so the necessary steps can be taken to avoid anymore such incidents.” Wallace is not the first British minister to fall foul of a hoax call. In May 2018, Boris Johnson – then the foreign secretary – talked about international relations and rude poetry with a hoax caller who pretended to be the Armenian prime minister. And, in 2015, it emerged that the authorities had been the target of two hoax calls. In one, an impostor claiming to be the head of GCHQ Robert Hannigan managed to get through to the then prime minister David Cameron on his mobile. In the other, a caller rang GCHQ and managed to obtain Hannigan’s mobile phone number. A government spokesperson said at the time that departments had been told to be more careful and that such incidents were taken seriously. Cameron, however, seemed less disturbed, recounting the story in lighthearted fashion during a pre-election visit to the Liberal Democrat-held marginal seat of Eastleigh in Hampshire. Explaining how he had rumbled the hoax caller, he said: “My BlackBerry went in my pocket, I answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established, which I do very frequently, between the head of GCHQ and some of the staff in my office.

3/18/2022,"Ayoung girl gets run over at the beginning of Suresh Triveni’s Jalsa, a brutal event that brings to mind Paul Haggis’s Crash, and not in a good way. Just like the painfully unsubtle Oscar winner, here a car accident and coincidences throw a group of people from different backgrounds into difficult dilemmas, forcing them to confront tough moral questions. Vidya Balan, who also stars in Triveni’s debut Tumhari Sulu, plays Maya Menon, a tough-as-nails reporter priding herself on her unwavering honesty. Her introduction suggests that the film might be a female-driven character study, as Maya is torn between her work and her disabled son. But Jalsa then changes gears dramatically, revealing that Maya is the driver behind the gruesome hit-and-run. To make matters worse, the young girl is the daughter of Maya’s trusted cook Ruksana (Shefali Shah), who has become an integral part of the family. As Maya hides her terrible secret from Ruksana, the film attempts to make some half-hearted commentary on wealth inequality as it cuts back and forth between swanky apartment condos and grimy working-class dwellings. But the critique is diluted as more characters are integrated into the already overstuffed plot, each representing a particular social stereotype: corrupt cop, obstinate trainee and so on. Like checking off items on a grocery list, Jalsa is more interested in weaving together as many pressing issues as possible, without investing any analytical attention to their causes. It’s a shame, since Jalsa could have been an effective two-hander for Balan and Shah, who are beautifully effective in the rare moments that they get to share the screen. Instead, what we have is a baffling drama that says very little about either inequality or morality.

3/18/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is already more than three weeks old, and the death toll in the bitter conflict is already likely to have exceeded 10,000. But there is also no sign of a decisive military breakthrough on either side, which could have important consequences for what is to come. On the one hand, Russia’s attack on its neighbour has been so poorly coordinated that it has left many military experts baffled. Yet while Ukraine’s defence has been exceptionally determined, it is also clear that it cannot force out the 150,000 invading troops from its territory. “The thing that has surprised onlookers is just how average the Russian military has been and how they have struggled with a complicated military operation,” said Phil Osborn, a former air marshal and chief of British defence intelligence. “If you look at the current position, Russia is struggling to maintain the tempo.” A US estimate released earlier this week suggests as many as 7,000 Russian soldiers have already died in the fighting, a tally partly confirmed by the growing number of death notices of uniformed young men appearing in Russian media. Its forces are estimated by western governments to have lost 10% of their armour. Many Russian soldiers were so poorly briefed they were surprised even to be invading Ukraine, and even more surprised to be shot at once they crossed the border. Special forces “were told it was a three-day excursion”, according to one account. So naively optimistic were Russian forces that some units dashed ahead to try to drive into Kyiv and Kharkiv, only to meet unexpected resistance. Chaotic logistics led to a vast, stalled 40-mile convoy outside Kyiv and fighting vehicles stuck in the early spring mud. But it took less than a week for the Russians to change tack. That was signalled by a cruise missile strike on the government building in the heart of Kharkiv, and has since been played out brutally in Mariupol, once a city of 450,000 people, where the past week has seen Russia bomb a maternity hospital and on Wednesday, a theatre where desperate people had been taking refuge below ground. Ukrainian officials estimated earlier this week that 2,500 civilians had been killed in Mariupol. Yet despite the fearful losses, neither it nor Kharkiv have fallen. Ukraine’s military has also lost between 2,000 and 4,000, according to the US, while the official UN estimate of civilian casualties is 780, a figure certain to rise. The first Russian forces arrived at the towns just north-west of Kyiv on the first day of the invasion, but since then they have become bogged down, failing to progress from Irpin and Bucha just outside the capital. Progress has also been stymied on the east side of the city, and western officials are beginning to question if Russia wants to fight its way through. “I think there is a question as to whether Moscow now intends to try to assault Kyiv or not, and I don’t know the answer to that,” said one on Thursday. Unlike Kharkiv or Mariupol, the capital has not been subject to heavy bombardment from the air or long-range artillery; and with three weeks to prepare the city’s defences any assault would be very costly – for both sides. Nato may not be willing to intervene by imposing a no-fly zone – a stance that has not shifted since fighting started – but western weapons have flooded into the country. On Wednesday night the US said it would send a further 9,000 anti-tank weapons and 800 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, after an appeal by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Congress on Wednesday. That has allowed Ukrainian forces to mount some ambushes of Russian tanks and armoured forces, in which light infantry have used shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapons to thwart the invaders’ advance. But Ukraine has no real answer when Russian forces turn to relentless bombing. Russian forces have also made significant gains in the south of the country, are already enforcing a naval blockade from the Black Sea, and, according to two analysts at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, are beginning to threaten Ukraine’s principal regular army formation, the Joint Forces Operation (JFO), which faces the Donbas region in the east. Sam Cranny-Evans and Sidharth Kaushal said that while Ukraine had held up the Russians in the north, the position of the JFO was “looking increasingly precarious”. Russian forces are continuing to push north from Crimea, to Beryslav along the Dnieper River, while other forces are bypassing Kharkiv and trying to join up with them as they head south. If Russian forces can succeed in encircling the Ukrainian army in the east it might, the authors argue, lead to a defeat of the country, as happened to France in 1940. “The destruction of armies tends to lead to a broader collapse of will that makes sieges unnecessary,” they said. Others argue that the broad strength of the Ukrainian resistance, the size of the country, and the course of the fighting so far demonstrate that Russia is unable to achieve a victory of conquest and occupation. “I think what we’ve learned is that Russia cannot win an outright victory – and that Ukraine cannot expel the Russians either,” said Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser. As the fighting becomes increasingly attritional, peace talks between the two sides have gathered pace in the last 48 hours, with Zelenskiy offering to abandon Ukraine’s quest to join Nato and seek a neutral status along the lines of Sweden or Austria. But, Lord Ricketts argued, that “wouldn’t be nearly enough for Putin to accept, given all the mayhem and suffering that has happened so far”. Given Putin’s political need to secure a significant victory, a more likely scenario, Ricketts said, could be an uneasy halting of combat operations, and an effective repartition of the country in Russia’s favour. “It would be ceasefire on a hold-what-you-have basis, which for Russia would include the ground its forces have flattened and occupied in the south and the east.

In July 2019, Louis Sojo and a few other officers were asked to confront a woman who was suspected of shoplifting at a Whole Foods grocery store in New York City. Sojo found food containers in the woman’s bag, filled with food from the store’s hot food bar. The woman told Sojo she was hungry. The officers proceeded to pay for the woman’s food, each providing $10 to cover her meal. Despite receiving nationwide praise for his act, Sojo said he faced years of scorn from his superior, Capt Julio Delgado. In a new federal civil complaint, Sojo alleges that Delgado “was incensed, and berated and belittled him for the effort … by stating in front of Sojo’s subordinates that ‘you are not a real cop’”. Sojo, who is of Puerto Rican descent, also alleges that Delgado repeatedly referred to him by the derogatory term “spic”. Delgado also disparaged Sojo for owning a landscaping business, called him a “slumlord” and the “Spic Trump”, all while in front of other members of the police force, the lawsuit said. On numerous occasions, Sojo attempted to ask Delgado to stop his behavior and was instead faced with threats, according to the filing, and Delgado threatened to eliminate Sojo’s overtime, refused to assign him to desk duty, and refused to grant him the right to a meal and bathroom breaks. Sojo tried speaking to his supervisor, Chief John D’amo, as well as a lieutenant from NYPD’s special operations division, who oversaw complaints from Sojo’s unit, both to no avail. When Sojo first encountered Delgado as a fellow sergeant, he said that Delgado claimed Sojo’s locker as a “hazing antic” and “mutilated it such that Sojo had trouble getting into his locker each morning, causing Sojo to be late for roll call every tour”. “Sojo has suffered extreme economic, physical, mental and emotional damages as a direct result of the aforementioned discrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation,” the lawsuit said. Sojo is not the first person to file a lawsuit against Delgado. According to the lawsuit, “Delgado along with the city have been subjected to civil lawsuits concerning discrimination and retaliation, with respect to discrimination against other subordinate members of the service, one of whom was Muslim.” Sojo is currently suing the NYPD, Delgado and the City of New York for race discrimination and unequal treatment, color discrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment. He has demanded compensatory and punitive damages, the amounts of which have not been disclosed.",News/US news,"NYPD officer was harassed by superior after good deed, lawsuit alleges",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/nypd-officer-harassed-good-deed-lawsuit
3/18/2022,"The abusive treatment of Child Q in a school in London by the police (Racism cited as factor in police strip search of girl, 15, at London school, 15 March) must serve as a turning point in the discriminatory and harmful treatment of Black children and young people in schools and by police officers. The local child safeguarding practice review into Child Q’s case presents deeply distressing details about the way she was treated. Such traumatic experiences can cause lifelong harm to a child’s mental health. And they create distress and fear across whole communities. In this case, the lack of justice for Child Q sends out a message that Black lives still don’t matter, adding to the distress and trauma. Racial aggression and injustice are toxic to mental health. We know that racism is systemic and ingrained in our culture and institutions. Tackling it requires systemic change and concerted action at every level. School should be a safe place for everyone. Today, many Black girls will feel unsafe at school. This has got to stop.Sarah HughesChief executive, Centre for Mental Health  While the police’s behaviour has clearly been despicable, racist and probably unlawful in the case of Child Q, recent history has already, sadly, highlighted such traits in the Met. What we didn’t expect, and is profoundly shocking, is the reported behaviour of the schoolteachers involved. In loco parentis, their role of protecting, guiding and supporting their students was paramount, yet catastrophically betrayed in this incident. We learn the strip-search officers were women, and would hope the teachers in attendance outside the room were too. What on earth were they doing? How would they expect a daughter of theirs to be treated? A child arriving at school smelling of cannabis is a child needing support and family engagement. Instead, she was swept off to a medical room and placed in a hostile and intimidating situation when she was markedly vulnerable already, receiving no parental or in loco parentis protection or support. The teachers’ responsibility to involve a parent, to call a lawyer and, above all, to show care and compassion was jettisoned to the point that no parent or pupil can in future trust them. They should go and the headteacher and governors must be re-evaluated.Sue EvansLondon  There are two issues being overlooked in the case of Child Q. First, if you think that someone might have drugs hidden inside their body, they need to be taken to hospital immediately. There is a risk that a package could burst, creating a medical emergency. Examining the person can increase the risk of that happening. Hospitals also have the scanning equipment to establish if there is a foreign body present without the same level of risk. More importantly, an adolescent who might have drugs hidden in this way is much more likely to be a victim of coercion than a willing operative. Informed consent is essential at every stage. If relevant physical evidence is found, it needs to be clear that it will be used to prosecute the true perpetrator rather than their victim.Dr Michael PeelLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/18/2022,"Employment lawyers reacted with surprise after P&O Ferries sacked 800 seafarers out of the blue, warning it may have broken several laws and could be hit with claims for unfair dismissal. As staff staged sit-ins on the company’s boats, with the backing of their trade unions, experts cast doubts over the legality of P&O’s plot to replace them with cheaper agency workers. The affair could end up costing P&O “hundreds of thousands” in unfair dismissal payouts and penalties for legal breaches, they said. What laws is P&O accused of breaking? Employers are legally required to consult workers during a statutory notice period before making them redundant. P&O did not do this, so trade unions believe that its actions are likely to be unlawful. “For those staff who have been, or are about to be dismissed, they will certainly have claims for unfair dismissal,” said Rustom Tata, chairman and head of the employment group at law firm DMH Stallard, adding that elements of employment law appeared to have been “wholly ignored”. Further, employers wishing to make more than 100 redundancies must notify the business secretary at least 45 days in advance of those dismissals. On Thursday afternoon, a No10 spokesperson said: “We weren’t given any notice to this.” Failure to notify the secretary of state would be a breach of the Trade Union & Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, the TUC said. Unions representing P&O workers have been consulting lawyers with a view to taking legal action. Redundancy notices are being issued, with the P&O apparently having recognised the unlawfulness of its actions with comments that enhanced compensation will be paid. P&O’s offer of “enhanced” redundancy packages indicates that it may have “recognised the unlawfulness of its actions”, according to Tata. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “If P&O breached the law they must suffer severe consequences – with ministers increasing the legal penalties if necessary. If one employer gets away with this, every worker is at risk.” Is this “fire and rehire”? Fire and rehire is a hugely controversial method used by some companies, usually – but not always – when in dire financial straits. It involves sacking staff and then telling them they can apply for their old jobs on less favourable terms. Companies that have deployed the tactic include Weetabix, Tesco, British Airways, Heathrow and British Gas. Trade unions and the public support a ban on the practice but ministers last year blocked a bill that aimed to do just that. The government would be “dismayed” if P&O were doing this, a No 10 spokesperson said. But what P&O is trying to do looks slightly different. Rather than rehiring staff to their old jobs, it is replacing them with agency workers and saying that sacked staff could, if they wanted, join those agencies. “That is effectively seeking to avoid having to renegotiate terms with staff and their representatives,” said Tata. The TUC said it was not yet clear if P&O was planning to rehire staff on inferior terms but warned it was a growing trend, with 9% of workers affected by such a scheme in the first year of the pandemic. What now for P&O workers? Some are staging sit-ins aboard the company’s ferries, with the support of unions such as the RMT and Nautilus International. Kathryn Evans, head of employment at law firm Trethowans, reckons staff could end up being paid “hundreds of thousands of pounds in failure to consult and unfair dismissal awards.” But Tata warned that the sit-ins could prompt a backlash from the company too. “The question may become whether it is lawful and reasonable for the employer to require the employee to leave the vessel and what the impact will be of an employee refusing to do so,” he said. “Might any unfair dismissal compensation be reduced to nil? Given the employer’s approach it is quite likely that the employees will find considerable sympathy in the employment tribunal – albeit when any case is finally heard.”",News/Law,What are the legal implications of P&O Ferries sacking 800 staff?,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/17/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-po-ferries-sacking-800-staff
3/18/2022,"Polly Toynbee is so right (The Tories railed against ‘green crap’. Why trust them to solve the energy crisis now?, 15 March), but it is unfair to describe those opposing gigantic windfarms and solar farms as “shire nimbys”. There are many environmentalists who don’t feel such massive industrialisation of our land and seascapes is necessary. Insulting anyone who opposes ugly and often highly profitable developments in the name of progress by calling them nimbys has a long history – those fighting to save Covent Garden from demolition, Welsh mining communities opposing windfarms, communities saving swathes of east London from elevated motorways, and in Brighton it was local people who rejected the wholesale demolition of now thriving neighbourhoods through the creation of conservation areas. As Joni Mitchell said, “You don’t know what you’ve got till its gone”. Let’s focus on insulation to keep people warm and lower their costs (and create skilled jobs), and on reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy security, not vanity projects for politicians and private developers.Diane OrdishBrighton  George Monbiot is right that agricultural land should not be given over to biomass energy production, which may be carbon neutral long term, but still releases lots of CO2 when burned (There are solutions to the food crisis. But ploughing up Britain isn’t one of them, 16 March). Plus, as he says, we need that land for food. While Polly Toynbee, also rightly, excoriates the Cameron administration for shredding progress towards renewable energy, she complains that “local protesters … fight large solar farms”. And so they should, for the same reason Monbiot challenges biomass farms. I’m all for solar panels (my roof is covered in them), but that’s where they should be – on roofs. There are enormous roofs on every warehouse, industrial estate and factory in the country, but hardly any are used for solar generation. Surely solar farms should use this large built acreage first before invading agricultural land?Anthony ChekeOxford  How ironic that Boris Johnson calls on the west to wean itself off its addiction to Russian energy supplies (Report, 15 March) the day after Polly Toynbee described so clearly how David Cameron spent a decade weaning the UK off renewable energy sources.Francis CreedHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
