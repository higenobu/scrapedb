3/11/2022,"As the portmanteau suggests, Deltacron is a Covid variant that contains elements of Delta and Omicron – in other words, it contains genes from both variants, making it what is known as a recombinant virus. “These recombinants arise when more than one variant infects and replicates in the same person, in the same cells,” says Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick. “Deltacron is a product of both the Delta and Omicron variants circulating in the same population.” This week Gisaid, a global community of scientists that shares virus information, posted that the first solid evidence for this variant had been shared by the Pasteur Institute in France. Gisaid says the variant has been identified in several regions of France and appears to have been circulating since the start of the year. “Genomes with a similar profile have been also identified in Denmark and the Netherlands,” Gisaid says. There have also been reports of Deltacron being detected in the US, and about 30 cases have been detected in the UK, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The i newspaper said the first cases of person-to-person transmission of Deltacron in the UK were expected to be confirmed this week. Experts have been quick to stress that recombinant variants are not uncommon, and that Deltacron is not the first and will not be the last to occur for Covid. “This happens whenever we are in the switchover period from one dominant variant to another, and is usually a scientific curiosity but not much more than that,” says Dr Jeffrey Barrett, who formerly led the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. However, with only a small number of cases of Deltacron so far identified, there is not yet enough data about the severity of the variant or how well vaccines protect against it. Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist at the World Health Organization, tweeted on Tuesday: “We have known that recombinant events can occur, in humans or animals, with multiple circulating variants of #SARSCoV2. Need to wait for experiments to determine the properties of this virus. Importance of sequencing, analytics & rapid data sharing as we deal with this pandemic.” Young agrees. “We need to keep an eye on the behaviour of this recombinant in terms of its transmissibility and its ability to escape vaccine-induced immune protection,” he says. “This also serves to reinforce the need to maintain genetic surveillance. As the virus continues to circulate, particularly in under-vaccinated populations and in people whose vaccine-induced immunity is decaying, we are very likely to see more variants including those generated through recombination.” But that doesn’t mean the variant is a reason to panic: according to the UKHSA, the variant is not exhibiting a growth rate of concern. “It has been seen in the UK a small number of times, and so far seems to be very rare anywhere in the world, with only a few dozen sequences among the millions of Omicrons,” says Barrett. “So I don’t think it’s anything to be concerned about at present, though I’m sure it will continue to be monitored.” Previous waves of Delta and Omicron, as well as vaccinations, mean there is likely to be at least some protection against this variant.",News/World news,What is the Deltacron variant of Covid and where has it been found?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/what-is-deltacron-covid-variant-uk
3/11/2022,"Pearson’s market value jumped by as much as a fifth after a US private equity group said it was considering making a cash offer for the educational publisher. News of the possible offer from Apollo sent shares in Pearson, which is finally emerging from a seven-year slump marked by a string of profit warnings and a record £2.6bn loss, up 20%, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 on Friday. “Apollo is in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible cash offer by certain of Apollo’s affiliated funds for Pearson,” the private equity company said. “There can be no certainty that any offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made.” Pearson’s market value increased by nearly £1bn to £6bn after Apollo’s announcement. Apollo now has until 8 April to announce a firm intention to make an offer or to withdraw, according to UK takeover rules. Pearson has been on a steady recovery path since being caught out by the seismic shift of students in the US, its biggest market, away from buying its new academic titles to snapping up secondhand titles and ebooks. The shift to a digital-first model began under its previous chief executive, John Fallon, who stepped down in 2020 after almost eight years. Its new head, Andy Bird, the former chair of Walt Disney’s operations, has doubled down on that approach, launching a Netflix-style subscription service, called Pearson+, at the heart of the company’s strategy. Bird has said Pearson also plans to take advantage of the pandemic-induced “great resignation”, as more employees leave jobs and learn new skills. Pearson reported an adjusted operating profit of £385m last year, an increase of a third over 2020.

3/11/2022,"Western governments are drawing up plans to impose punitive tariffs on Russian trade amid efforts to further isolate Moscow from the global economy after the invasion of Ukraine. In a development aimed at ratcheting up the pressure on Vladimir Putin, the G7 group of wealthy nations is considering options to strip Russia of “most favoured nation” (MFN) status under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Such a move would mean imposing tariffs – border taxes paid by importers – on Russian products such as vodka and other goods. Designed to raise the price of goods to discourage trade, tariffs hit exporters but can also add to consumer costs. Sources said an announcement by the G7 could come as early as Friday, although they also stressed that a desire to maintain international unity and to coordinate sanctions could see the details announced at a later stage. It comes as the US pushes for tougher action against the Kremlin, with sources telling the Reuters news agency that Joe Biden would use a statement on Friday to remove Russia’s “permanent normal trading relations” with the US – the term used by Washington for MFN status. The US currently only excludes two countries from this designation: Cuba and North Korea. Rather than tariffs at the current applied rate in the US of about 3% on average across Russian goods, the border tax would increase to more than 10 times that level. Imposing punitive tariffs on goods sold by Russia to the west would be designed to increase the pressure on the Kremlin, in a move similar to tactics used by the former US president Donald Trump to exert pressure on China amid a bitter dispute between Washington and Beijing. The move would be largely symbolic for the US given the relatively limited export volumes involved, with the world’s biggest economy importing less than $30bn (£23bn) from Russia last year. Western leaders have also already announced plans to phase out Russian oil and gas imports. The consequences would, however, be bigger in the EU, which is Russia’s biggest trading partner accounting for more than a third of total imports and exports. Russia sold about €95.3bn (£80bn) of goods to EU nations in 2020, with more than 70% of this figure dominated by fuel and mining products. Trade with the UK is also limited outside of oil and gas, with Russia accounting for 1.5% of total imports and 0.7% of exports. Nevertheless, those imports include popular products such as vodka, meaning higher tariffs would push up the cost of goods for British consumers. The development follows steps taken by Canada to remove MFN status for Russia, while experts said other nations following suit could prelude a broader push to rescind the country’s membership of the WTO – the global arbiter for trading disputes. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that just over three-quarters of WTO members supported a UN resolution censuring Russia, although they said this might not guarantee they would vote the same way on stripping the Kremlin of membership. A spokesperson for the UK Department for International Trade said: “Russia’s assault on Ukraine is a barbaric attack against a sovereign democratic state, and the UK has implemented wide-ranging sanctions that are inflicting significant economic pain on Vladimir Putin’s regime. “We are discussing further steps to ramp up pressure on Russia’s economy and nothing is off the table until Russia reverses its illegal invasion of Ukraine.”",News/World news,G7 nations draw up plans to impose heavy tariffs on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/g7-nations-drawing-up-plans-impose-heavy-tariffs-russia-ukraine
3/11/2022,"Over the past fortnight, the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag has become a familiar sight of solidarity – from stands at football stadiums to posts on social media. And now it has hit the red carpet. At the SAG awards, celebrities including Tyler Perry, Michael Douglas and Shari Belafonte wore ribbons or pocket squares in yellow and blue, while actor Greta Lee wore a blue skirt and yellow polo neck. With the Baftas taking place in London this Sunday, this trend is likely to grow. At Balenciaga’s fashion show last week, each seat had a Ukrainian flag, and the show ended with a model wearing a full yellow outfit, followed by one wearing all blue. They were mirrored by celebrities attending – Salma Hayek wore a half yellow-half blue tunic – while Isabel Marant took a bow after her show wearing a yellow and blue sweatshirt. Outside the Prada show earlier this month, a group of Ukrainian influencers staged a protest – with street style photographers snapping them posing with their flag rather than for their outfits It’s an idea that has even reached royalty. To visit the Ukrainian Cultural Centre in London this week, the Duchess of Cambridge wore a sweater in the blue of the flag, combined with a badge of the colours. If these gestures come from a place of support, the clash between the glossy world of non-Ukrainian celebrities and the grim reality of what is happening in Ukraine could be seen as insensitive. “[It] could not be more at odds with current political situation,” says Grazia’s Hannah Banks-Walker. “I totally get that people might think it’s an empty gesture.” She does believe there is some merit to the fact that the crisis is referenced even in this world of high glamour. “It is a very visual signifier of standing in solidarity with Ukraine,” she says. Rose Forde, who will be styling several clients for the Baftas, says “visual statements always hold an amount of power but are best when paired with direct action such as donations”. Making a political statement on the red carpet has become something of a trope in recent years. After the Harvey Weinstein revelations, women at the Golden Globes in 2018 wore black as a way to, as actor Alison Brie said, show solidarity “with all the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused”. While the awards ceremonies after the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 were from home, actors on video calls, including Regina King, Sandra Oh and Uzo Aduba, wore clothes in support of the campaign, and bringing the killers of Breonna Taylor to justice. Sunday’s Bafta red carpet may see a more subtle way to support those in Ukraine, suggests Banks-Walker, through celebrities wearing items by Ukrainian designers. “I feel like that’s actually even more of a statement because you’re not making a big song and dance. It’s more like you’re actually financially contributing to their economy and society.” Anna October is a Ukrainian fashion designer, now in Paris. She has mixed feelings about the red carpet trend. “I understand for them it’s not their war, sometimes they just want to show solidarity and bring the audience’s attention to a war,” she says. “It’s also good but I would more appreciate the collaborative kind of support.” Forde is making a stand by “only working only with the luxury brands that are taking action by either closing stores in Russia and or supporting Ukraine-based employees”. Forde points out that “Ukraine is an important cultural and artistic force in the modern fashion industry”. October is one of a number of Ukrainian designers who have built an international profile over the last few years. For her, working with designers would be a more meaningful way to help. “I urge all members of [the fashion industry] to collaborate with our creatives. Throughout the last eight years we managed to prove that we deserve being put on the international fashion scene and right now it’s the best time to build tighter connections for a collective benefit.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Snazzy solidarity: is celebrity and fashion support for Ukraine crass?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/11/celebrity-fashion-ukraine-support-blue-yellow-awards-season
3/11/2022,"Russian airstrikes hit three cities in Ukraine on Friday – including two in the country’s west – as the scope of its military offensive widened. The raids hit airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, far from the main areas of conflict, and residential buildings in the strategically important city of Dnipro, which sits on the Dnieper River. The air raids came as new satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed that a 40-mile convoy that had been approaching the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, had dispersed as tanks and artillery moved to what appeared to be firing positions to the north-west of the city. The Ukrainian military warned Russia was trying to “block” Kyiv by taking out defences to the west and north of the capital, adding that there was also a risk to Brovary on the east. As the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said that about 2 million people, half the population of the metropolitan area, had left the capital, preparations continued for its defence. “Every street, every house is being fortified,” he said. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.” Ukrainian soldiers described fierce fighting for control of the main highway leading into the capital, while missile strikes were reported hitting Velyka Dymerka just outside Kyiv’s city limits. “It’s frightening, but what can you do?” said Vasyl Popov, a 38-year-old who works in advertising sales. “There is nowhere to really run or hide. We live here.” Despite heavy losses of personnel and equipment in the third week of Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine – which has seen cities placed under siege and subjected to bombardment – Vladimir Putin’s forces were pushing ahead with their campaign. The Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russia used high-precision long-range weapons on Friday to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk “out of action”. The airstrike on the Lutsk military airfield early on Friday left two members of the Ukrainian forces dead and six people wounded, according to the head of the surrounding Volyn region, Yuriy Pohulyayko. Images of the aftermath showed what appeared to be a massive explosion that set fire to what looked like fuel storage tanks and cratered the runway. Residents in Lutsk said they were woken at 6.45am on Friday morning when four Russian rockets hit the city’s military aerodrome. One said: “We live 2kms away. The rockets woke us up. We had been living in Kharkiv and left the city last week. The Russians bombard Kharkiv 100 times a day. Compared to that, this wasn’t as bad.” The strikes also targeted an airport near Ivano-Frankivsk, where residents were ordered to shelters after an air raid alert, the mayor, Ruslan Martsinkiv, said. Three Russian airstrikes also hit the eastern industrial city of Dnipro on early Friday, killing at least one person, according to the Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Heraschenko. They hit an area near a chemical plant, leaving a shoe factory completely destroyed, and breaking the windows on a nearby kindergarten. The new wave of strikes came as clear skies on Friday made Russian air operations easier. Despite claiming to have “neutralised” the Ukrainian air forces and air defences in the first few days of the war, in the last week Russia has hit Ukrainian airforce sites a number of times, including striking an airfield in Vinnytsia – the city that is the headquarters of the Ukrainian airforce – with eight cruise missiles in a single attack. The focus on Ukraine’s air assets appears to be part of a continuing effort by Russia to gain uncontested control of the air, which it has so far failed to achieve, but which would allow more air support to forces on the ground. The latest strikes came amid contradictory assessments of Russian progress around Kyiv, with the Ukraine general staff saying the Russian advance had been halted and the Petangon suggesting that it had moved forward about 3 miles in the north-west. The satellite photos of Russian concentrations around Kyiv, meanwhile, appeared to show a massive convoy previously detected outside the Ukrainian capital had fanned out into towns and forests near the city with artillery pieces raised for firing, in another potentially ominous movement. A US defence official speaking on condition of anonymity said Russian forces moving toward Kyiv had advanced about 3 miles (5km) in the past 24 hours, with some elements as close as about nine miles from the city. It appeared the convoy forces were moving west around the city, trying to encircle it to the south, according to Jack Watling, a research fellow at a British defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute. “They’re about halfway around now, to be able to close off on the south,” he told BBC radio. He added they were likely preparing for a “siege rather than assault” on Kyiv because of continuing low morale and logistical problems. While a move to a more static approach of shelling Kyiv from outside might be less costly for Russian forces in the first instance, it is not without risk. The Ukrainian use of Turkish-supplied combat drones has been effective against Russian vehicles, and more static positions would be vulnerable to other Ukrainian aircraft, perhaps explaining the recent stepped up effort to knock Ukrainian airfields.",News/World news,Russia widens attack with airstrikes on western Ukraine cities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-widens-attack-with-airstrikes-on-western-ukraine-cities

3/11/2022,"You probably don’t know what happened when Barbara met Alan, but you should. Barbara Lisicki – the UK’s first disabled female comic – and Alan Holdsworth – AKA musician Johnny Crescendo – were two rebellious, punk-inspired performers on the 1980s cabaret scene when they met, fell in love and changed the course of civil rights history. The couple were the force behind the disabled people’s Direct Action Network (DAN), which successfully convinced the Conservative government to pass the Disability Discrimination Act in 1995. It was a landmark bill, the first of its kind in the UK. So when it came to televising the story, a landmark approach was also required. “There’s never been a story about disability told like this onscreen before,” says Ruth Madeley, who plays Lisicki in the new BBC drama Then Barbara Met Alan. “There was one moment when we were filming, we had hundreds of disabled people on set, and it was one of the most surreal moments of my career. I thought: ‘Why does this feel different?’ It’s because I’ve never been surrounded by so many disabled actors and creatives in one space. It felt so incredible.” Madeley (who played Rosie Lyons in Russell T Davies’s Years and Years) is joined by Arthur Hughes (Help, The Innocents) as Holdsworth in a one-off drama with groundbreaking authenticity. The tale of how the pair went from having post-cabaret sex in a London hotel room to changing the course of history doesn’t just feature disabled talent in front of the camera – they’re also the creative force behind it. “I just remember thinking this cannot be – I will not let this be – the only time I feel like this on set,” says Madeley, of a production that had 16 disabled crew members and 13 of the real-life members of DAN as part of its 55 disabled supporting artists (plus a main cast with 17 disabled actors out of 24). “It felt really revolutionary. It shouldn’t have felt that way. But it did because it happens so rarely.” On the surface, it is a relatively simple civil rights story, in the same vein as Pride or Made in Dagenham – a tale of oppressed people banding together to create social change. But it is not solemn or sad. Instead, it is driven by Alan and Barbara having such a punk-ish sense of mischief that one of their iconic slogans was the phrase “Piss on pity”. They sing while they struggle. And the fun they have along the way is infectious – we’re shown two people who live life with full conviction and at full speed. “It was so empowering. It was fun. It was real,” says Hughes. “It did feel like a watershed for this type of film being made.” We see Alan, Barbara and their disabled comrades begin with a joyful invasion of a bus station to daub “transport for all” across a wall while having a paint fight – only to end up shouting through megaphones atop police vans, handcuffing themselves to public transport and being repeatedly arrested in their quest for accessible buses, the end of ITV’s “pity-porn” annual charity Telethon, and the eventual codifying of disability rights in law. We also witness the opposition they faced, from a government that thought mandating accessibility would be too much of a burden for businesses, and from the non-disabled activists who wanted DAN to be less radical, with DAN finally having to storm the Houses of Parliament to make their point. The drama uses historical protest footage to remind us that disabled people were not given rights by some benevolent society, but had to prise them out of institutions steeped in ableism. Wheelchair users threw themselves in front of traffic to block roads, manacled themselves to vehicles and were hoisted from their chairs by police. Given the brutal consequences this had for some protesters, commemorating this is especially important. Some got sick. Others died (“because of what they put their bodies through on these protests,” says Madeley), and the names of many of those who made such sacrifices are now forgotten. The sight of hundreds of disabled people descending on a maddeningly inaccessible Parliament is one of the most moving scenes in the show, reminding us of the power of a group fuelled by righteous anger. Yet beneath the riotous action, the drama makes a revolutionary decision to be, above all, a love story. Crucially, a disabled love story – something completely ordinary but somehow still a societal taboo. With the couple eventually torn apart by their differences over how to pursue their political goals, the fact it is not a fairytale with a made-for-TV ending makes it all the more compelling. Instead, it is raw, sexy, thrilling and heartbreaking. In other words, it is real life. For both Madeley and Hughes, this is what drew them to the characters – and what they are most passionate about. “Take everything else away and you’ve got these two characters who are so strong and magnetic and fiery that you automatically want to learn more about them,” says Madeley. “I’ve been very lucky to have played a love story on screen in the past, but this was next-level stuff. To show these two characters, who both had disabilities, fight and laugh and kiss and make love and have children … There’s so much that disabled actors and disabled characters don’t get to do on screen. We did it all.” Bafta-winning screenwriter Jack Thorne, who co-wrote the script with the actor Genevieve Barr, credits the production company Dragonfly with putting Alan and Barbara’s relationship at the heart of the show: “We were brought the story by [executive producer] Tom Pullen and he had a really simple and glorious pitch – they changed the world but in doing so destroyed their relationship. Two arcs that dovetail – you can’t hope for more as a writer,” he says. “But they’re people too, and while we felt the burden of telling the story of DAN, capturing their truth was most important.” That truth makes the wider story more emotionally resonant. The audience are desperately rooting for DAN to win against their powerful foes, but the more visceral rooting is for Alan and Barbara – for them to face down their demons and heal their relationship. The knowing look they share when the law is finally changed conveys it all: love, loss, sacrifice and the profound sense of comfort found only in the people who really know what you have been through. Madeley has described the depth of their partnership as a gift: “You’re there to make people feel things … And this film does it in spades.” The importance of not just showing disabled love on screen, but more broadly, showing disabled characters as rounded, full people is something essential to Madeley and Hughes. Particularly given that disabled characters are often secondary parts – the best friend, the brother, the lonely girl the hero takes to the prom instead of his actual love interest. “This is a story about two civil rights leaders,” says Hughes, “but they weren’t just that. They were parents, musicians, comedians, entertainers, friends. There’s so much more.” One scene springs to mind: Barbara and Alan hosting friends to hate-watch the Telethon. There’s banter, friendship, disagreement, frustration. Tensions are high but so is determination. “These guys were angry and wanted rights but they did it with big hearts and such style,” says Genevieve Barr. She says the characters’ inherent unconventionality allowed the writers to play with form. The drama could have got tangled up trying to explain history through hammy dialogue, but instead happily bulldozes the fourth wall and has Barbara speak directly to the audience, guiding them through the narrative. “The story lent itself to a way of telling, and a way of doing, things differently,” says Barr. “And I hope it does push people to look at things differently – the spaces around them and the people who inhabit them.” The stars and writers believe that all the ways this drama is different – its fully disabled crew, its disabled love story – will allow audiences to see that change is possible. They can choose to be part of Barbara and Alan’s legacy, joining the fight for better accessibility in our physical world and richer, more diverse narratives in our culture. Let’s hope the drama spurs viewers to unpack the boxes disabled people are put in, and see us in our complexities: determined, flawed, feisty, scared. And that they’re left with that memorable DAN slogan ringing in their ears: it’s time to piss on pity. Then Barbara Met Alan is on BBC Two on 21 March",Arts/Television & radio,Let’s storm Parliament!

3/11/2022,"Saturday 30 October, Tottenham versus Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium: Marcus Rashford is a picture of lissome menace, leaving Eric Dier and Emerson Royal in a different postcode as, on 86 minutes, he glides on to Nemanja Matic’s ball and, with zero doubt, beats Hugo Lloris to seal a 3-0 win. This Saturday, Manchester United versus Tottenham, Old Trafford: Rashford does, now, harbour doubt. Will he be selected by Ralf Rangnick? Will he reverse the sputtering form that has yielded four league goals in 18 appearances at 217 minutes each. And, will he remain at his boyhood club beyond the summer? Rashford at a crossroads, debating whether his United career should end. There is a disconnect here, a dislocation. The lad from Wythenshawe’s living of the dream has soured. It was never meant to be this way. In the 18 months after his debut, Rashford won the FA Cup, Europa League and League Cup. He made his England bow, played at Euro 2016 and scored on his senior, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League and international debuts. All before turning 20 after Louis van Gaal first selected him in February 2016. Rashford has the armoury of the prototype elite forward. His is a vibrant cocktail of youth, a slim and powerful 6ft 1in inch frame and afterburner pace. He can dribble, he tries tricks, he is a leader – on and off the field. And, there is something else – it seemed. A hunger for, the revelling in, being asked to rise to the occasion as at Parc des Princes in March 2019. Rewind to then: the score is Paris Saint-Germain 1 United 2, the aggregate 3-2 in the final seconds of a Champions League last-16 second leg. Rashford has already hounded Thilo Kehrer into making the error that leads to Romelu Lukaku’s opener before later seeing the rebound from his shot finished by the Belgian. Now, Rashford is asked to convert a tie-winning penalty after a four-minute wait – two of these caused by Damir Skomina, the referee, consulting the touchline screen before awarding the kick in a dramatic VAR decision, and two by PSG players trying to distract Rashford. He does not care: the penalty hits the roof of the net. “Fearless” is Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s verdict afterwards. But, now, the fear at United is that the 24-year-old may view the future elsewhere. Rashford even considering departing is a black eye for the maligned Glazer ownership. It speaks of the £494.8m debt-mountain. The zero league titles in nine years. The zero teams who were challengers. The gang of four managers – David Moyes, Van Gaal, José Mourinho and Solskjær – who have been sacked. Of how United have had as many temporary managers: Rangnick is the fourth (after Ryan Giggs, Solskjær and Michael Carrick). Rashford is United’s ultimate poster boy. A wholesome, socially conscious footballer who has caused Boris Johnson to perform U-turns when campaigning for those in poverty to be fed, holding the prime minister and his government to account. And he is a sponsor’s dream, worth a fortune to United in image rights and copious other commercial spin-offs. A prime factor in the reason Rashford may depart – a lack of game time – is his own form: this season he has contributed two league assists to go with the paltry goal return, numbers which form part of a wider pattern. This is Rashford’s seventh campaign for United – in the previous six, double figures in finishes have been reached only three times, with two of these 10 and 11, in 2018-19 and last year respectively. Only once has there been a count – 17 – in the bracket consistently returned by the very best: in 2019-20. For a tall man, four headed league goals is underwhelming and shows a glaring gap in his game: one was on his league debut against Arsenal, and there have been none for two years. Caveat time. If Rashford has been dropped by Rangnick for a reason solely his responsibility – a lack of form – might there be another reason he is unhappy? That having been at the club since nine, a deep dismay has developed at the endless loop of mediocrity United are caught in? Such that he is pondering whether a short career is being stalled by waiting for an emergence from the doldrums on a tomorrow that may never come. Which throws up the next question: where could Rashford go? Last summer PSG identified him as a candidate to replace Kylian Mbappé if the latter left for Real Madrid. Yet should the Frenchman depart this close season Rashford is understood to have fallen down this list. Where else? Even if Liverpool were interested it seems incredible United would allow Rashford to go to their fiercest rival and/or he would want to go there for the same reason. Manchester City: doubtful – Pep Guardiola wants a proven prolific No 9; Rashford is not this. Fifty-eight league goals in 197 appearances (3.39 per strike) is his ratio. Chelsea? For now the club cannot buy anyone. This debate points to how Rashford has not yet developed as it was thought he would. He is still young. But the clock ticks. Mohamed Salah was 23 when he returned to English football two years after Chelsea sold him to Roma. His record at the west London club was moderate: two goals and an assist in 13 league appearances across two seasons. At Liverpool, though, the Egyptian has hit the stratosphere, plundering 32, 22, 19, 22 in his four complete league terms and 19 in this one. Can Rashford do this? First, he has to win back his place. Next, he has to start scoring – regularly. Then, he has to decide on his future. How it has come to this for Rashford should provoke serious soul-searching: for him and the club he grew up adoring.",Sport/Football,Rashford facing crossroads with Manchester United dream souring | Jamie Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/marcus-rashford-facing-crossroads-with-manchester-united-dream-souring
3/11/2022,"The founder of the housebuilder Redrow has promised to pay for 1,000 Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK, after criticising the government for its slow response to the humanitarian crisis created by Russia’s invasion. Steve Morgan, who set up Redrow in 1974 and is now one of Britain’s richest men, said there was no time for delays and urged the government to speed up the process of offering visas to Ukrainians. “Watching the humanitarian crisis unfold in front of our eyes is absolutely devastating,” said Morgan, a former chairman and owner of Wolverhampton Wanderers. “We have to stop the suffering and Boris Johnson and Priti Patel have to stop the delays.” The UK has issued about 1,000 visas while Poland has taken more than 1.2 million refugees, Hungary has accepted 190,000, Germany more than 50,000 and Italy almost 20,000. “Offering to sponsor 1,000 Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK through the Steve Morgan Foundation is one way we can help but we need to do more,” he said. “I felt so helpless watching the images of desperate families fleeing Ukraine that I knew I had to do something. This is not the time for delays. I hope other people will do the same.” The 69-year-old said he will meet the cost of bringing the refugees to the UK and paying for their accommodation for up to six months. On Friday, Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said the number of Ukrainian refugees had exceeded 2.5 million since the invasion began on 24 February. The number of refugees from Ukraine — tragically — has reached today 2.5 million.We also estimate that about two million people are displaced inside Ukraine.Millions forced to leave their homes by this senseless war. Earlier this week, ministers began considering a climbdown to allow Ukrainians with temporary visas to bring relatives to the UK after Ukraine’s ambassador called for an easing of restrictions. While Morgan’s initiative is being paid for through his foundation, which was set up in 2001, he said it does not have the facilities to handle the logistics of the relocation programme. Staff at the foundation, which distributed almost £26m to charities struggling with the pandemic last year, have contacted a number of MPs to ask for clarity on the sponsorship process. Morgan, whose fortune is estimated at close to £1bn, retired as chairman of Redrow, which has a stock market value of nearly £2bn, in 2019. The Liverpudlian received an OBE for services to the construction industry in 2012.

3/11/2022,"As the sun set on one of the most turbulent days in Chelsea’s history, there was still business to be done. There were few home comforts in store for the women’s team as they travelled to West Ham, on a night when those would have been keenly appreciated. Emma Hayes’s side were in need of a win to keep on the coat tails of Arsenal at the top of the Women’s Super League. Accompanied by so much uncertainty, their loyal legion of fans descended on Dagenham, decked out in royal blue, to offer unrelenting support. In the circumstances, the action on the pitch was a sidenote to more significant matters. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stunned the world and the government’s response felt close at home. The imposition of sanctions against Chelsea’s owner, Roman Abramovich, has been much discussed and was not wholly unexpected. But the instinct that something was going to happen sooner or later did little to lessen the blow for the fans, players and staff. “I thought: ‘This is going to be a very long day,’” said Tracy Brown of the fan group Chelsea Pride. “To be quite honest, we were all expecting it at some point. We know that it’s been fast-moving. At the same time, we all absolutely condemn everything that’s happening over in Ukraine and our thoughts go out to everybody over there. But as a fanbase, we know that this is obviously just going to be a difficult time for us.” This is the crux of the issue. The fans, for the most part, are understanding of the government’s strong measures. However, news that their club’s very existence could be under threat was sure to trouble even the most confident supporter. The anxiety was clear among those who follow Hayes’s side home and away. They have found themselves a target of anger and chants. Kerrie Evans of the Chelsea Women’s Supporters’ Group said: “It’s a mix of emotions. As a supporters’ group, it’s been a tough week. We’ve had all sorts of abuse and the whole situation has nothing to do with us. We’ve had no support really on how to handle it. So we’re all just teaming up together and supporting each other.” Thoughts will inevitably turn to the future of the women’s team. If the history of women’s football tells you anything, it is that funding is not guaranteed and is at an owner’s discretion. Hayes’s side have been heavily backed by Abramovich, leading to their incredible trophy haul. There will be lingering fears around whether a new owner will be so committed. “I would hope that whoever comes in will see that the whole club has a winning mentality,” Brown says. “So, when you’re buying it, you’re buying a complete Chelsea family. Hopefully, whoever comes in will see that we are more than just the men’s team. We have a youth team and a women’s team, and we win trophies across the board.” On Thursday Brown and Evans joined talks with the sports minister, Nigel Huddlestone, alongside the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust to ensure the women’s team’s fans are not easily forgotten. A journey to Dagenham followed in pursuit of some light relief. They supported their side vociferously, backing players with their customary playlist of songs and making everyone aware of their presence. Their team delivered. There was little drama on the pitch as Chelsea secured a routine 4-1 victory. Hayes, pleased with the performance, was keen to focus on the bigger picture: “There’s a war going on in Ukraine,” the manager said. “There are bigger situations. And yes, today is a big moment for the club. But I believe in giving both sides the time to get it right going forward. I think it is important for the players, the staff, and the fans to be patient.” With victory sealed and a challenging day drawing to a close, it was left to Brown to issue one more rallying cry: “We can understand why the sanctions have come in; we’re not denying that. But our club is based around the fans. Chelsea Football Club just turned 117 years old because of the fans. If it wasn’t for the fans, there wouldn’t be a club … As fans, we want to see that we and our club are protected.”",Sport/Football,"Abuse, fears and hope: Chelsea Women fans adjust to a new reality",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/chelsea-women-fans-abuse-fears-hope-new-reality-roman-abramovich
3/11/2022,"Covid-19 infections are rising in England, figures suggest, with about one in 25 people estimated to have had coronavirus last week – levels last seen in the middle of February. The trend echoes that in Scotland, where infection levels have been rising for weeks. In both countries the number of Covid patients in hospital is also increasing: in Scotland the number of Covid patients reached 1,636 on Thursday, surpassing the high of 1,571 on 19 January during the height of the Omicron wave. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs from randomly selected households, reveal that an estimated 2,073,900 people in the community in England had Covid in the week ending 5 March, equating to 3.8% of the population or about one in 25 people. The week before, the figure was about one in 30. In Scotland, the figures suggest about one in 18 had Covid in the most recent week, while in Northern Ireland and Wales it was one in 13 and one in 30 respectively, suggesting infection levels are rising in all countries in the UK. “Today’s data show an increase in Covid-19 infections across the whole of the UK, with a continued rise of BA.2 Omicron cases,” said Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey. “It is too early to say whether these increases have been driven by the easing of restrictions, recent school holidays or something else, but we will continue to carefully monitor the latest data.” The figures came after findings from the React-1 study, led by Imperial College London, suggested cases of Covid were rising in older people. Experts said the trend may be linked to a number of factors, including increased socialising, waning protection from booster jabs and the rise of the BA.2 variant of Omicron, which is more transmissible than the original version.",News/World news,"Covid cases and hospital admissions rising in England, data suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/covid-cases-england-omicron-levels-ons-data
3/11/2022,"Consumers are being duped into paying a premium for fashion products that make grand claims about their environmental credentials but have no evidence to back them up, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said as it prepares to name and shame high street clothing companies. Entire lines of clothing are being labelled “sustainable” and “eco-friendly”, without the company having proof that the whole process – from manufacture to delivery, packaging and sale – is good for the environment, according to the CMA. The CMA is investigating claims by Britain’s fashion sector and will shortly have a list of the worst offenders. It is investigating sector by sector, with the packaged food industry and supermarkets likely to be next. It is estimated that UK consumers spend £54bn annually on clothing and footwear, and this is expected to continue growing in the coming years. According to some estimates, fashion is responsible for between 2% and 8% of global carbon emissions, as well as causing waste and pollution. About 300,000 tonnes of used clothes are burned or buried in landfill each year in the UK. But buyers trying to do the right thing by buying sustainable products are being bamboozled by sweeping claims, according to the watchdog, resulting in a loss of trust which could stop the UK reaching its climate commitments. Cecilia Parker Aranha, the CMA’s director of consumer protection, said: “According to our research, something like 60% of people had said they were either likely to or fairly likely to be willing to pay more for products, and I think it was up to about 9% more [money] for products that were environmentally friendly. My impression is that people are willing to pay a premium.” This means companies have been quick to slap green claims on their products, sometimes without going to much effort to make the items more sustainable. “We have taken the view that the growing consumer demand for green products and their willingness to pay for those green products has increased the incentive for businesses to be seen to be green, whether or not they actually are green,” Parker Aranha explained. Claims being investigated by the CMA include unfair comparisons that individual items of clothing are “better for the environment” without qualifying how; claims about the use of recycled materials in new clothing; and entire ranges of clothing within stores being branded as “sustainable”. Parker Aranha said: “I was really sceptical about anybody that’s making a sweeping claim that a product is ‘eco’ or ‘sustainable’ because the business would be having to really show that every element of the product from production through to disposal will be good for the environment, not harmful to the environment. The other thing I would watch is if they say they’re ‘made with recycled fibres’. They are often only made with 16% to 20% recycled fibres. “For those very generic general claims, most businesses won’t be in a position to prove that the product is good for the environment every step of the way. If you use the word ‘sustainable’, I think that really means that you have to be sustainable throughout the whole lifecycle.” The CMA will name the companies it considers to be the worst offenders, as an example to the rest of the industry, and ask them to make changes. If they do not make changes to their advertising, they could be taken to court. Investigators pointed out that its ticket-touting crackdown led to a legal case against the website Viagogo, which then made changes to how it operated. It said that greenwashing fashion companies could face similar consequences. “If businesses don’t voluntarily undertake those changes, then we have the option to take them to court to force them to do that,” Parker Aranha said. This area is still relatively un-investigated, with companies free to call themselves “eco” and face little scrutiny. Parker Aranha added: “I think greenwashing and misleading environmental claims is not an area that a lot of regulators in the UK have looked into so far.” This could cause a loss of faith in sustainable products, with customers giving up on making eco-friendly choices. It could also cause companies that do make an effort to be green to face a competitive disadvantage. “This is a problem as a large amount of these claims are false, consumers are buying the wrong products, and the businesses [that] are doing the right thing are losing out,” said Parker Aranha. “It could also really undermine trust. And ultimately, if you undermine trust, consumers don’t believe what they’re seeing on any packaging as far as green claims are concerned. And that’s going to have an impact on the UK’s ability to do what it needs to do to tackle climate change and the other sustainability challenges that we face.” Eco Some ranges are named “eco” or have “eco” in the name, but it would be very difficult to prove whether the entire supply chain and manufacturing process was eco-friendly. Sustainable – labelling of an entire range Certain components of a product can legitimately be called “sustainable” – but check if there is a qualification. For example, it might be made using a non-toxic process, but if an entire range or garment is labelled “sustainable”, this raises a red flag because it is a sweeping statement. Made with organic or recycled cotton Many clothing lines say they are made with recycled or organic materials when these fibers only make up a small percentage of the fabric. Unfair comparisons If something is labelled “greener” or “more eco-friendly” but does not indicate what this comparison is with, it could be a greenwashing claim.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Greenwashing UK fashion firms to be named and shamed by watchdog,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/11/greenwashing-uk-fashion-firms-to-be-named-and-shamed-by-watchdog
