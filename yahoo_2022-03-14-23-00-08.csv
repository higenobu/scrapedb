Why do flocks of birds swoop and swirl together in the sky? – Artie W., age 9, Astoria, New York A shape-shifting flock of thousands of starlings, called a murmuration, is amazing to see. As many as 750,000 birds join together in flight. The birds spread out and come together. The flock splits apart and fuses together again. Murmurations constantly change direction, flying up a few hundred meters, then zooming down to almost crash to the ground. They look like swirling blobs, making teardrops, figure eights, columns and other shapes. A murmuration can move fast – starlings fly up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour). The European or common starling, like many birds, forms groups called flocks when foraging for food or migrating. But a murmuration is different. This special kind of flock is named for the sound of a low murmur it makes from thousands of wingbeats and soft flight calls. Murmurations form about an hour before sunset in fall, winter and early spring, when the birds are near where they’ll sleep. After maybe 45 minutes of this spectacular aerial display, the birds all at once drop down into their roost for the night. Unlike the V formations of migrating geese, murmurations provide no aerodynamic advantage. Scientists think a murmuration is a visual invitation to attract other starlings to join a group night roost. One theory is that spending the night together keeps the starlings warmer as they share their body heat. It might also reduce the chance an individual bird would be eaten overnight by a predator such as an owl or marten. This dilution effect might be part of the reason murmurations happen: The more starlings in the flock, the lower the risk to any one bird of being the one that gets snagged by a predator. Predators are more likely to catch the nearest prey, so the swirling of a murmuration could happen as individual birds try to move toward the safer middle of the crowd. Scientists call this the selfish herd effect. Of course, the more birds in a flock, the more eyes and ears to detect the predator before it’s too late. And a gigantic mass of whirling, swirling birds can make it hard to focus on a single target. A falcon or hawk can get confused and distracted by tricky wave patterns in the murmuration’s movements. It also must be careful not to collide with the flock and get hurt. Over 3,000 citizen scientist volunteers reported spotting murmurations in a recent study. A third of them saw a raptor attack the murmuration. That observation suggests that murmurations do form to help protect the birds from predators – but it’s also possible a huge murmuration would be what attracted a hawk, for instance, in the first place. Murmurations have no leader and follow no plan. Instead, scientists believe movements are coordinated by starlings observing what others around them are doing. Birds in the middle can see through the flock on all sides to its edge and beyond. Somehow they keep track of how the flock is moving as a whole and adjust accordingly. To learn what’s happening inside murmurations, some researchers film them using many cameras at the same time. Then they use computer programs to track the movements of individual starlings and create 3D models of the flock. The videos reveal that the birds are not as densely packed as they might appear from the ground; there is room to maneuver. Starlings are closer to their side neighbors than those in front or behind. Starlings on the edge frequently move deeper into the flock. Mathematicians and computer scientists try to create virtual murmurations using rules that birds might follow in a flock – like moving in the same direction as their neighbor, staying close and not colliding. From these simulations, it seems that each bird must keep track of seven neighbors and adjust based on what they’re doing to keep the murmuration from falling apart in a chaotic mess. And they do all this while flying as fast as they can. Large schools of fish can appear to behave like murmurations, as do groups of some swarming insects, including honeybees. All these synchronized movements can happen so fast within flocks, herds, swarms and schools that some scientists once thought it required animal ESP! Biologists, mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists and engineers are all working to figure out how animals carry out these displays. Curiosity drives this research, of course. But it may also have practical applications too, like helping develop autonomous vehicles that can travel in tight formation and work in coordinated groups without colliding. Hello, curious kids!

3/14/2022,"Elon Musk on Monday advised his Twitter followers to own ""physical things"" when inflation is high. He seemed to make an exception for bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin, saying he won't sell his holdings. Musk, the world's richest person, said in 2020 he wants to sell ""almost all"" his physical belongings. Elon Musk advised Monday that it's better to own ""physical things"" like homes and stocks – but added that he won't sell his bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin holdings. Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and the world's richest person, said it was better to own physical things instead of US dollars when inflation was running high. He appeared to make an exception for cryptocurrencies, though. In a Twitter thread discussing inflation, Musk said: ""As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high."" He added: ""I still own & won't sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw."" Inflation in the US hit 7.9% year-on-year in February, its highest since 1982, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Tesla and SpaceX were ""seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics,"" Musk said Monday. Musk announced in May 2020 that he planned to sell ""almost all"" his physical belongings, including his multimillion-dollar property portfolio. He sold his last remaining home in December 2021. The billionaire entrepreneur is an advocate of cryptocurrencies, albeit with caveats. He's regularly voiced support for dogecoin and discussed the merits of crypto with leading figures from the tech industry. Musk's Tesla said it bought about $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in early 2021, to be used a hedge against inflation. Tesla's share price has fallen about 35% this year, sending Musk's fortune down by about a quarter – but he's still the richest person in the world, with a net worth of around $206 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Commodity prices were already on the upswing on the back of supply chain disruptions as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month added to supply-side strains to the energy, metals, and grains markets, because both countries are leading suppliers.

3/14/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia could take full control of major Ukrainian cities and cautioned the West that it had sufficient military clout to fulfil all of its aims in Ukraine without any need for help from China. ""The defence ministry of the Russian Federation, while ensuring the maximum safety of the civilian population, does not exclude the possibility of taking major population centres under full control,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Peskov said that some of Ukraine's major cities were already surrounded by Russian forces. When asked by Reuters about remarks by U.S. officials who had said that Russia had asked China for military equipment, Peskov said: ""No."" ""Russia possesses its own independent potential to continue the operation. As we said, it is going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full.""

3/14/2022,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Monday, March 14, 2022 I would compare this week in the markets to that feeling when you passed your driver's test and were able to roam the open roads with freedom for the first time. So much anticipation on what's possible, and it all lived up to the hype (until you got into your first accident, then it sucked). This week the Federal Reserve meets! This is the interest rate-hike meeting investors have been waiting for since the third quarter of 2021. Jerome ""Big Money"" Powell — otherwise known as the Federal Reserve chairman — will hop on the mic Wednesday afternoon and try to show he lives in a few different worlds. It's a world where Powell will have to acknowledge again he is anti-inflation and will hammer it into the ground with more rate hikes besides the one he will sign off on. But, it's also a world where Powell doesn't want to sound too hawkish so as to not rattle a market already concerned with the Russia-Ukraine war and soaring energy prices. The difficulty threading the needle here for Powell is immense, underscored by the following commentary from Wall Street pros. ""In the face of a new crisis, the Fed put strike remains sharply lower than usual and actually adds negative convexity to the market at present. The more the situation in Europe progresses, and the higher the prices, the more the Fed has to add to the turmoil. As a result, things could get a lot uglier before the storm passes."" — David Zervos, Jefferies' managing director. ""We suspect that Fed officials will be reluctant to seriously consider a 50bp hike until downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish. But we do not expect the war to knock the Fed off of a 25bp-per-meeting tightening path. Inflation is likely to remain uncomfortably high at every remaining FOMC meeting this year, and we think Fed officials will want to deliver some tightening action in response unless they fear that another rate hike would risk pushing the economy into recession.""— Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius (who sees seven rate hikes this year) ""We believe that, like the original Volcker 'break inflation' tightening in 1979, stocks will be resilient. Growth is slower but remains positive, and the commodity market surge, absent nuclear escalation, may have peaked. The Fed does not want a recession."" — Evercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel ""There is certainly no reason to panic yet, but in light of the latest evidence, the Fed needs to remain very vigilant. Put simply, Powell can't afford to take his eyes off inflation, even in the face of geopolitical risks. Thus, we expect the FOMC to continue to lean hawkish."" — Jefferies Chief Economist Aneta Markowska We wish Powell well, no doubt he will earn every penny of his $203,500 annual salary. As for you traders out there, we wish you well too — remember don't get too complacent after the rally later last week. And in case you were wondering, that first-time driver exhilaration came by way of my 1987 Chevy Monte Carlo SS with T-tops, two amps and a giant subwoofer box in the trunk. I paid for the car with my own cash all saved up from caddying: thousands of dollars each year in insurance, thousands of dollars in gas (it was 8 cylinders) and thousands of dollars in early trips to the mechanics. My dad wasn't paying for any of it (like none of it, trust me), and years later I thank him for for putting me through the school of hard knocks for, well, 25 or so years. On that note, Happy trading! Go get 'em Big Money! Charts to watch: If you are worried $5-plus gas prices are going to put the U.S. economy into a recession this year, then keep a close eye on the number of miles driven by motorists. As the team at Jefferies points out below, so far soaring gas prices haven't led to a major slowdown in miles driven. Bets are off though if gas goes above $8 a gallon as seen in my tweet from one Chevron gas station in California. The Fed's geopolitical risk index hasn't been this high since the 2005 London bombings, details Goldman Sachs below. Whether this means the Fed will only lift interest rates just enough so the economy enters a mild recession later this year, who knows. It's just a good chart to observe. It's only Monday so roll with me here. And back to cars, the prices for used electric vehicles have surged 89.9% year-over-year as drivers seek out cheaper driving alternatives, says Thinkum (below chart). The research outfit cites Carmax inventory data. The prices for used Teslas on Carvana puts a finer point on this data. Trending tickers: One of the hottest tickers on our platform the past five days has been health care apparel maker Figs (FIGS). The company's earnings report last week hit all the right notes: 1) earnings beat; 2) profitable high margin business; 3) strong outlook. Yahoo Finance Live recently chatted with Figs co-founder and co-CEO Trina Spear. Making its way back atop the trending ticker list for the second time in two weeks is Occidental Petroleum (OXY). Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway scooped up another $1.5 billion of the oil giant's stock, per a new SEC filing. Buffett bought $4.5 billion in Occidental Petroleum the week before. And lastly two fresh names on the trending ticker page, both of which are having ugly months. FedEx (FDX) shares have lost 11% in the past month, likely on concerns about profit margins in a rising energy cost backdrop. As for GameStop (GME), its stock is down 24% in the last month — with the sell-off triggered by Chairman Ryan Cohen launching an activist campaign against Bed Bath & Beyond. The meme stock crowd apparently doesn't like sharing its beloved leader. Miscellaneous: Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" a fourth COVID-19 vaccine will be necessary. My colleague Julie Hyman will be sitting down live with Bourla from the South by Southwest conference this morning on Yahoo Finance Live. You'll want to watch. Speaking of watching, if you are an avid Uber user, watch your digital wallet more closely starting on Wednesday. Due to the rise in gas prices, that's when Uber will implement a ""temporary"" surcharge of 45 cents to 55 cents on each Uber ride and a 35 cents to 45 cents for an Uber Eats order. American Express hasn't held a traditional investor day in some time, but that will change on Wednesday with presentations from CEO Stephen Squeri, CFO Jeff Campbell and other execs at the company. Amex has been riding high from several solid quarters of new card clients, notably among millennials. It's reasonable to expect some pretty bullish longer term growth targets from the company. But, that could be balanced with near-term caution given the new stresses on U.S. consumers and businesses. More on gas prices: There are 1.4 million views and counting on this Yahoo Finance TikTok video of outraged gas consumers. Paying an arm and a leg for gas right now? Hit me with pics on Twitter @briansozzi — and let me know your feelings on it all. Let it all hang out, I can take it. While we are on gas prices, here is a nifty chart put together by our team showing gas prices from around the world. Rest easy you aren't paying $10.72 a gallon.
