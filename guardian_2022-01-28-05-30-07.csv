1/28/2022,"Aston Villa have signed the defender Calum Chambers from Arsenal. The 27-year-old, who can play at centre-back or right-back, is the fourth arrival since Steven Gerrard took over as manager, joining Philippe Coutinho, Lucas Digne and the goalkeeper Robin Olsen. Chambers, who has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal, has made only five appearances this season, with three of those in the Carabao Cup and his most recent Premier League game coming in late August.  The former Southampton player has been at Arsenal since 2014 and his deal was due to expire this summer. Arsenal said Chambers had moved for an undisclosed fee. Arsenal are close to a finalising deal to sign the goalkeeper Matt Turner from New England Revolution. The fee for the USA international is expected to be about £6m with up to £2.5m in add-ons and the intention is that he will join in the summer. The move could be accelerated if Bernd Leno leaves this month but New England are working on the basis that Turner will stay with them. Arsenal have agreed terms with the 27-year-old, who has played his whole career in the US and started 13 of his country’s 22 matches last year. Turner is viewed by Arsenal as cover for Aaron Ramsdale, who joined from Sheffield United last summer and has been preferred to Leno. Ramsdale’s form has restricted Leno to four cup appearances since late August and it appears a question of when, not if, the German leaves. Arsenal have also been pursuing the Juventus midfielder Arthur Melo but their proposal of a six-month loan for the Brazilian was turned down by the Italian club, who asked for any loan to last until the end of next season.",Sport/Football,Arsenal sell Calum Chambers to Aston Villa and close on keeper Matt Turner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/27/arsenal-sell-calum-chambers-to-aston-villa-and-close-on-goalkeeper-matt-turner
1/28/2022,"Good morning. There are concerns over the ability of home rapid antigen tests to detect the Covid Omicron variant, as issues over the supply of the tests to concession card holders rumble on. Covid is “out of control” in central Australia, representing a “catastrophic failure” by the Northern Territory government to carry out its own emergency plans, according to the three biggest Aboriginal organisations in the NT. The groups have accused the NT government of failing to adequately carry out emergency plans that had been made with them “well in advance” of the current outbreak. “Many of the issues we are facing were foreseen, and plans made to address them. But there has been a catastrophic failure by government to discharge its responsibility to all Northern Territory residents by implementing these plans in Central Australia,” they wrote in a scathing letter to the NT chief minister, Michael Gunner.  The world is facing an energy crisis, as Russia and Ukraine sit on the brink of war. Gas market prices have already surpassed record highs and threaten to saddle European households with a cost of living crisis. Russia is Europe’s largest supplier of gas, a third of which flows through Ukraine’s gas pipelines to countries across the continent. Russian gas flows have been a quarter lower than usual over the past year, but European leaders now fear that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could spell an energy catastrophe if gas exports are cut. Tensions over a possible war are one factor stoking energy costs, with global oil prices at their highest levels since 2014 with Brent crude, one widely cited gauge, topping US$90 (A$127) a barrel on Wednesday. But what do the higher prices mean for Australians and is there much we can do about it? A re-elected Coalition would pour $1bn into Great Barrier Reef conservation projects over the next decade, the Morrison government says, just months after campaigning to prevent the reef being listed as “in danger” by the world heritage committee. The announcement, to be made by the prime minister Scott Morrison in Queensland on Friday, comes a fortnight after Labor pledged $163m to protect the natural wonder. It highlights the reef as a key election fight in the Cairns electorate of Leichhardt. Only one of Australia’s 23 approved at-home rapid antigen tests explicitly states it will detect Omicron, as the Therapeutic Goods Administration carries out a review of all tests to check how they work with different variants of Covid-19. Pharmacies in some areas of Sydney with the highest rates of Omicron infections are struggling to provide rapid antigen tests to concession card holders despite participating in the federal government scheme. Aged care workers are being “pushed to the edge” amid a worsening Omicron crisis, a lack of rapid tests, dire staffing shortages and effective bans on essential visitors, unions and advocates say. Social media companies should commit to taking down unauthorised political material in agreed timeframes to combat misinformation in elections, according to the Australian electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers. Electricity demand hit a record low in several states during a milder-than-usual end to 2021, but average wholesale prices were up from a year earlier due to the higher cost of fossil fuels even as their share of the market dived. Humanitarian agencies have mounted an emergency response across southern Africa this week as the death toll from tropical Storm Ana reached 70. Officials reported that at least 41 people had been killed in Madagascar, 18 in Mozambique and 11 in Malawi. Russia has said it is willing to continue talks with the US over European security, but is not optimistic about their prospects after Washington and Nato allies again rejected a key part of Russia’s proposed new order for post-cold war security. British lawyers have cast doubt on the strength of Prince Andrew’s defence to Virginia’s Giuffre’s lawsuit and whether it can help him settle the case, thereby avoiding a “disastrous” court trial. The World Health Organization chief has backed the veteran rock star Neil Young in his dispute with the music streaming behemoth Spotify, thanking the musician for “standing up against misinformation and inaccuracies” around Covid vaccinations. Poland has started building a wall along its frontier with Belarus aimed at preventing asylum seekers from entering the country, which cuts through a protected forest and Unesco world heritage site. A letter written to a 12-year-old girl in Lithuania has been delivered 51 years after it was sent by a pen pal in Poland. The gap between Australian climate policy and the science is closing far too slowly, says Lenore Taylor, the Guardian Australia editor. She says Australians have to keep up the pressure. Tiny steps towards net zero are being undermined by new fossil fuel projects. But an election year offers the chance to hold our politicians to account, she says. In a road trip prompted by an Australian man’s imagination of America, Emily Bitto explores the literary trope of the masculine hero’s quest – through her novel Wild Abandon. In midlife and mid-pandemic, our connective ties can feel loose, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith. Rebinding them, she says, requires commitment. You may have struggled to find a rapid antigen test over summer – but what’s behind the empty shelves, and could the Morrison government have done more to anticipate demand?

1/28/2022,"Frank Lampard, Vítor Pereira and Duncan Ferguson will have their chance to land the Everton manager’s job on Friday when the club conduct a final round of interviews with the candidates to succeed Rafael Benítez. Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s majority shareholder, is expected to travel from his home in Monaco to hold the interviews in London alongside members of the board. The intention is to arrive quickly at a decision, albeit 12 days after Benítez was sacked, in order to strengthen the new manager’s squad before Monday’s transfer deadline.  Lampard and Pereira have been interviewed several times by the Everton hierarchy since Benítez’s departure and have impressed. Ferguson, in his second spell as caretaker-manager, will also be interviewed for the permanent role. Despite Wayne Rooney having his admirers at Goodison Park the Derby manager will not be interviewed. Lampard, out of work since being sacked by Chelsea 12 months ago, appeared to have the edge over Pereira after a hostile reaction to the Portuguese coach emerging as Moshiri’s preferred choice on Tuesday. The former Porto and Fenerbahce manager took the unusual step of pitching for the job and defending his record in a live television interview on Wednesday, but he remains in the running and no final decision will be made until after Friday’s interviews. Everton’s plan to finalise an appointment and move in the transfer market rests on the erratic Moshiri, however. The billionaire has had a late change of heart over several managerial appointments in the past, including David Moyes and Nuno Espírito Santo, but there is a pressing need for Everton to act swiftly with the club at risk of relegation. Benítez had wanted a central midfielder this month and that position requires reinforcing with Abdoulaye Doucouré sidelined for at least four weeks with a groin injury. His fellow midfielders Fabian Delph and Tom Davies are also out injured until March. Everton’s highly rated 19-year-old striker Lewis Dobbin has ended uncertainty over his future by signing a new three-and-a-half-year contract.",Sport/Football,"Lampard, Ferguson and Pereira face final interviews for Everton job",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/27/premier-league-everton-manager-frank-lampard-vitor-pereira-duncan-ferguson
1/28/2022,"British Sign Language (BSL) is on course to become a recognised language, after the government backed a proposal by a Labour MP. The private member’s bill, introduced by Rosie Cooper, aims to improve accessibility for deaf people and would see the promotion of BSL when making public service announcements.  It would also see the launch of an advisory board of BSL users to offer guidance to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on how and when to use it and look at increasing the number of BSL interpreters. It will encourage government departments and public bodies to follow the guidance, giving deaf people “equal access to education, employment, public services such as the NHS”, according to the British Deaf Association (BDA). DWP minister Chloe Smith said: “Effective communication is vital to creating a more inclusive and accessible society, and legally recognising British Sign Language in Great Britain is a significant step towards ensuring that deaf people are not excluded from reaching their potential. “Passing the bill will see [the] government commit to improving the lives of deaf people, and will encourage organisations across the nation to take up the BSL mantle, benefiting both themselves and the deaf community.” If the bill passes its reading on Friday, 28 January, it will have two more stages to pass before becoming law. The final reading is expected to take place in March. Rosie Cooper, the MP who proposed the bill and whose parents were both born deaf, said: “The deaf community have constantly had to fight to be heard. This bill sends a clear message that they deserve equal access and will be treated as equal.” Although BSL was recognised as an ‘official’ language by the UK government in 2003, it does not have the same legal protections as Welsh or Gaelic, for example. EastEnders actor Rose Ayling-Ellis made history as the first deaf contestant on BBC One’s Strictly Come Dancing and has urged people to back the bill. She told BBC News: “Why doesn’t this country legally recognise BSL? It’s our language. It feels wrong, it isn’t right, it should be accepted.” She added: “If I go to the doctor and there is no interpreter, it means I have to bring a family member with me – but I don’t want that, I want privacy.” In the wake of her celebrated Strictly win, research revealed more than three-quarters of deaf children thought the show has given the public a better understanding of deafness. There are an estimated 87,000 BSL users in the UK. David Buxton, chairman of the BDA, said: “Deaf people still do not have access to the same essential information and services that are available to the hearing population. “The Equality Act does not cover linguistic rights. We are forced to rely on inadequate disability discrimination legislation to access information in our own language. “British Sign Language is an indigenous language of the UK and should be accorded the same legal protection as Welsh and Scottish Gaelic.”",News/Society,British Sign Language to become recognised language in the UK ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/british-sign-language-to-become-recognised-language-in-the-uk
1/28/2022,"The UK competition watchdog has called for the power to fine social media influencers if they fail to tell followers when posts are paid for by advertisers. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) told MPs it needed stronger tools to enforce consumer protection laws and deal with an “endemic marketwide problem”.  This month the advertising regulator named six social media celebrities, including Jodie Marsh and five former Love Island contestants, for repeatedly failing to tell followers when they were paid to promote products in posts. The CMA’s senior director for consumer protection, George Lusty, told the digital, culture, media and sport committee in the House of Commons that court action, which could result in fines, took too long and called for his organisation to have the power to issue fines to enforce its rulings. “We think therefore there is a need for more powerful deterrents, and we really welcome what the ASA [Advertising Standards Authority] is doing, but ultimately we think that civil fines would be an important addition to the arsenal of regulators here,” he said. The government is proposing to give the CMA the power to fine influencers for breaches of consumer protection law, under changes to competition and consumer policy that are currently under consultation. Deceptive or “hidden” advertising is illegal in the UK. “The market has blossomed, the influencer marketing market has doubled in two years and it’s very, very effective,” Lusty told MPs. “It’s much more powerful than traditional advertising techniques and it’s particularly powerful with younger people in persuading them to buy things.” However, Lusty said there was a low level of enforcement by the social media platforms themselves. “We’re still seeing across all platforms a very low level of sanctions actually being applied and practised against influencers.” Last year Instagram, the photo and video sharing app, committed to a package of measures to crackdown on undeclared paid-for posts after an investigation by the CMA. This included Instagram vetting people’s posts if it appears that they have been paid to promote a business. In 2019 the CMA said it had secured formal commitments from 16 celebrities, including Alexa Chung and Ellie Goulding, to state clearly if they have been paid or received any gifts or loans of products that they endorse. The chief executive of the ASA, Guy Parker, told the hearing that the “scale and pace” of influencer advertising online and its “ephemeral” nature – some Instagram Story posts disappear after 24 hours, making them difficult to capture for monitoring purposes – contributed to difficulties with enforcement.",News/Media,Watchdog calls for fines for influencers who fail to declare sponsorship,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/27/watchdog-calls-for-fines-for-influencers-who-fail-to-declare-sponsorship
1/28/2022,"The government has sold assets at rotten prices many times over the decades, but the sale of Annington Homes in the dying days of John Major’s administration in 1996 was one of the very worst deals. Television’s Michael Portillo, the defence secretary at the time, was the man who approved the sale-and-leaseback of 57,400 Ministry of Defence homes to the Japanese bank Nomura for £1.7bn, a sum that a quarter of a century of house-price inflation has made look ridiculous. The worst part was that the MoD, in exchange for a 25-year discount on rent, took responsibility for maintenance and refurbishment, tasks that would normally fall to the landlord. When the National Audit Office reviewed the whole arrangement in 2018, it concluded that taxpayers were worse off by £2.2bn-£4.2bn during the first 21 years of a set-up intended to last for 200.  Hindsight is perfect, but details from the NAO report are excruciating. The MoD’s “preferred business case model” had assumed house prices would rise at only 1% a year excluding inflation for ever more. Ho, ho. Taxpayers got stuffed. The winners were Annington’s owners, who enjoyed a beautiful annual return of 13.4% until the end of March 2017, calculated the NAO. That yearly rate won’t have altered much since then. Only the owners of Annington have changed (sort of) since the original deal. Guy Hands, Nomura’s in-house deal-maker in 1996, bought the business in 2012 for his Terra Firma private equity firm. You can’t blame the MoD’s current incumbents for looking for an escape route. Jeremy Quin, defence procurement minister, thinks he’s spotted one: use “statutory leasehold enfranchisement rights” to buy out Annington’s interest in a portfolio now reduced to 38,000 homes. A test case has been launched. Cue screams of blue murder from Terra Firma, which reckons it will win in court but judges the manoeuvre “an appalling thing for the British government to do”. Think of the poor end-investors, it says – “UK pension funds and sovereign wealth funds representing strategic military allies of Britain.” Think also of Terra Firma: it’ll be first in line for a haircut on its equity stake if the MoD gets the right to buy “enfranchised” homes at attractive market prices. One can see Hands’ point, of course: it wasn’t his fault that Portillo & co suffered from privatisation mania in the mid-1990s and tapped bad numbers into their models. But it doesn’t mean one has to sympathise. Ministers are obliged to be serious about saving money for taxpayers and there may be the odd billion of value available at Annington. Quin may be right or wrong on the legality – the courts will decide – but he’s right to give it a go. Here’s an odd definition of success: easyJet made a loss of “only” £213m in the last quarter of 2021 and burned £450m of cash. Actually, one shouldn’t be too critical. A year ago, both scores were twice as bad. It is partial evidence that, in impossible Covid circumstances, the airline is trying to live up to its promise to trim capacity, find savings and minimise the financial pain for shareholders until the clouds clear. On that score, the rolling back of travel restrictions in the UK and the rest of Europe represents the first test of whether the much-touted pent-up demand for travel will be released. Johan Lundgren, chief executive, sees “a strong summer ahead”, but, since passengers are understandably booking later than they used to, all predictions come cloaked in caution. One can say, though, that easyJet’s board was 100% correct to dismiss last autumn’s cheeky bid approach from Wizz Air, whose last-quarter losses, unlike easyJet’s, did not reduce. Valuing airlines in the current climate is virtually impossible. Regain altitude first. EasyJet, after an embarrassing share price underperformance versus its main rivals, should have further to climb. Dr Martens is “a canvas for rebellious self-expression across generations,” or so the corporate blurb says. The stock market was certainly in an expressive mood on Thursday. The shares were kicked 9% lower on a trading update that showed a slowing in revenue growth to 11% in the Christmas quarter. Is the corporate promise of “mid teens” annual expansion into the middle distance still solid? Management says yes, but investors clearly want to see it to believe it. Floated at 370p a year ago, the shares hit 500p last February but are now 294p. Or maybe investors have remembered that private-equity backer Permira still has a pile of shares to sell. Its 36% holding is a serious overhang if the next numbers disappoint.",News/Business,Taxpayers lost billions on MoD housing – so I can’t feel sorry for Terra Firma,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/27/taxpayers-lost-billions-on-mod-housing-so-i-cant-feel-sorry-for-terra-firma
1/28/2022,"Boris Johnson has been told it is “time for the truth to be released” as he faced more calls to publish a long-awaited report into “partygate” in full and not “suppress crucial details”. Officials in the Cabinet Office are still wrangling over the final version of Sue Gray’s findings on a string of alleged Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street and other parts of government.  Despite anticipation reaching fever pitch earlier this week that the report on which the prime minister’s premiership could hang was close to completion, its publication was delayed when Scotland Yard opened its own investigation. Sources said on Thursday night that the senior civil servant’s findings had still not been sent to No 10, with government lawyers studying the document amid concerns that publishing some information could prejudice the new investigation. Gray is said to want to send it in a state that can then be published by Downing Street in full, without the need for any further redactions. Some Tories believe the report will not be released until early next week, given they think Gray will be mindful of criticism it is being sneaked out if publication came on Friday or the weekend, when most MPs will be back in their constituencies. Government insiders have rejected accusations they are responsible for the delay, and suggested instead it is because of the Metropolitan police’s discussions with the Cabinet Office. But Scotland Yard has not formally objected to full publication of the Gray report, sources said. Gray’s findings were sufficiently clear cut in their detailing of rule breaches to trigger a criminal investigation, according to the explanation about why police were acting, from the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick. Johnson claimed he had “absolutely not” been involved in delaying the report, stressing people should wait for the independent inquiries. He said “of course” it would be published in full, but Downing Street has made clear that is only the intention of No 10, as it is not yet aware what the format will be and whether any sensitive personal or security information would need to be redacted. “We are in no way seeking to block the report,” the prime minister’s spokesperson said. “It remains our intention to publish the report as it is received from the investigation.” But one Tory critic feared Johnson would “wriggle out of the scrutiny he deserves once again”. Another senior backbencher, Mark Harper, said: “The report must be published in full. Any attempt to conceal or suppress crucial details would be wrong.” Opposition parties also raised concerns over the handling of the report’s publication. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said in a letter to Johnson it “would be unconscionable that after the public has sacrificed so much in our collective effort against this pandemic, you would allow any obstruction of the truth or any unnecessary delay to the publication of this report”. She said it was time for the truth to be released, and pressed the prime minister for a commitment to publish the report in full along with any evidence also submitted to him, with any redactions accompanied with a full explanation. Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said photos, emails and messages should be released too. He said “any attempt to whitewash this matter or spike this report or to start to hide again” would provoke even more public anger. Davey said: “It would be a bitter insult to the public, especially to the bereaved, if the report was not now published in full.” Some Tory MPs are waiting to read the Gray report before deciding whether to submit a letter calling on Johnson to stand down. If 54 are sent, a vote of no confidence will be held. Allies of the prime minister believe the longer-than-expected wait for the official civil service investigation is proving helpful for him, because it is letting anger in the party ebb. Nevertheless, even some ministers who are being loyal in public admit they are preparing to reevaluate their support for Johnson in private once they have seen the full extent of Gray’s report. Even if Johnson manages to avoid or win a vote of no confidence, his restive backbenchers are concerned about the growing cost-of-living crisis, coupled with the planned national insurance hike due to come into effect in April, just when the energy price cap is also dramatically reduced.",News/Politics,‘Time for the truth’: MPs call on Boris Johnson to publish ‘partygate’ report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/mps-call-on-boris-johnson-publish-partygate-report-sue-gray
