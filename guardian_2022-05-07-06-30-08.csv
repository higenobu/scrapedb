5/7/2022,"Manchester City are considering signing Paul Pogba on a free transfer when the Frenchman’s deal expires at rivals Manchester United in the summer. The Guardian understands Pogba is open to crossing the city. Pogba is interested in working with the Manchester City head coach Pep Guardiola, who believes the World Cup-winner could operate in a deeper role in midfield. It would be a controversial move, following in the footsteps of Carlos Tevez, by leaving United for City and would see Pogba accept lower wages than he is currently on. City cannot make an official approach to Pogba until the end of the season, but the Guardian understands they are willing to offer the Frenchman a four-year contract, with the option of a further year. Academy graduate Pogba, 29, will not extend his contract at Old Trafford with the club following his £89m return from Juventus in 2016. The midfielder has struggled to make the desired impact at Manchester United, scoring 29 times in 154 league appearances across six seasons where he has won one League Cup and Europa League. The club offered him a new deal last summer, which was rejected, and they have not been back with another. Pogba shared an agent, prior to Mino Raiola’s death, with Erling Haaland who, the Guardian understands, will join City from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. City will pay the striker’s release clause and terms have been agreed with the Norwegian, whose father Alfe had a spell with City at the start of the century. City are set to lose one central midfielder this summer with veteran Brazilian Fernandinho announcing he will leave to return to Brazil to carry on his playing career, leaving the squad light in that position. It is rare a player of Pogba’s pedigree and commercial value comes on the market for nothing. Few would be able to afford Pogba’s wages – he is currently earning a reported £290,000 a week at Old Trafford – so he could be left with few options in the summer. Paris Saint-Germain are thought to be interested in acquiring his services, while Real Madrid have tried to sign him in the past. Pogba is likely to have played his last game for United after limping off during their defeat against Liverpool earlier this month with a calf injury.",Sport/Football,Manchester City consider signing Paul Pogba on free from Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/manchester-city-consider-signing-paul-pogba-on-free-from-manchester-united
5/7/2022,"The theory goes that teams seeking European success must first encounter failures and in the case of Sale it could just work in their favour on Sunday. Alex Sanderson’s side are the considerable underdogs when they face Racing 92 in their space-age stadium in Paris but, having fallen in France in the quarter-finals last season, Sale are hoping previous heartache will equip them to overcome one the favourites for the title. The aforementioned theory was repeatedly referenced by Saracens at the time they would reach the knockout stages, then the final in 2014, before lifting the title in 2016. They would call it “pounding the rock” – the idea being that it will eventually break – and if Sanderson is getting tired of talking about his European glory days with Sarries, there are lessons to be learned. In addition, Sale have this week been seeking permission to take control of the giant screen at one end of Racing’s La Defense arena and play motivational videos during their hour-long captain’s run there on Saturday. The idea is that catching yourself on a giant screen can be distracting if it is something you have not encountered before and Sale want to leave no stone unturned in their preparation to face Finn Russell et al. “I don’t think you have to [lose before you can win] but I think it is proven that most teams find it difficult, or statistically speaking there is an element of learning,” said Sanderson. “Of being able to not be distracted by the occasion, by the noise. The more you get used to it the less stressful it is. “If you have won once or twice before, and realise it doesn’t really matter in terms of your culture, your security of your job livelihood, it has less of an effect of stress and you are able to perform better for longer and make better decisions. There is the neuroscience behind it. The more you do it, the better you adapt to it, the less stressful it is, the better you perform. So I guess there is truth in it. If you have done it, been there before, you have got a better chance of doing better the time after.” Helping Sale’s cause, Tom Curry makes his first start for the club since picking up a hamstring injury during the Six Nations while Manu Tuilagi is back in the side, having been rested for last weekend’s victory over Newcastle. “He is well primed. Manu is an English-Samoan thoroughbred,” added Sanderson. “It was purely conservational on Manu’s part last week, just to keep him fresh and not risk injury and make sure his loading is up there. He is better than he would have been if he had played last week.” Dean Richards, meanwhile, is to step down as Newcastle’s director of rugby at the end of the season but will continue in a consultancy role. Richards has spent the last decade at Kingston Park as part of a managerial career that began in 1998 and has included successful spells at Leicester, Grenoble and Harlequins.",Sport/Sport,Sale hope ‘pounding the rock’ will pay off in quarter-final against Racing 92,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/sale-hope-pounding-the-rock-will-pay-off-in-quarter-final-against-racing-92-rugby-union
5/7/2022,"They still play the opening riff to Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple whenever Leicester run out at home. Coincidentally it was released in the first week of May some 49 years ago and it also feels a long time since the Tigers last hosted a more thunderous European knockout fixture. TodaySaturday’s quarter-final against Leinster seems unlikely to involve much peace or love. It takes more than a few pumped-up supporters, clearly, to beat one of Europe’s classiest sides but, equally, there is no question the Premiership leaders quietly fancy their chances inside their own noisily atmospheric lair. Drag the visitors from their comfort zone, hassle them in possession, kick smartly and turn the forward screw and maybe Leicester can dare to dream about making only their second Champions Cup semi‑final since 2009. There was certainly no hint of defeatism in the voice of the Tigers captain, Ellis Genge, on the eve of a game which will define how far the club have come under head coach Steve Borthwick’s stewardship. “We are not plucky losers, we are not that type of team,” muttered Genge this week. “I’m not going to let people build the manifestation of Leinster being the European giants that they are. They have got to come to our backyard. It’s our gaff.” Never mind if “Fortress Mattioli Woods Welford Road” does not exactly trip off the tongue and slightly interferes with the dark, forbidding vibe. As Genge says, this is not a contest for which anyone needs motivating – “I don’t think games get much bigger than Leinster at home in the European quarter-finals” – and years of painful exile from Europe’s sharp end is also intensifying local hunger. At this point it is worth recalling last year’s quarter-finals when Leinster flew over to England to play the defending champions Exeter and won 34-22. “They kept an intensity in the game which meant we never really settled,” lamented Exeter’s Rob Baxter, having seen his side ultimately outdone at the breakdown and physically nullified. There is a significant difference this time: Leinster will not be operating in an echoing, empty ground but, from Genge’s perspective, in one of rugby’s most intimidating cauldrons: “It’s definitely the best stadium I have played in in terms of atmosphere, hands down. “We’ve got a brilliant bunch of fans and I hope to see them there en masse because they really are a 16th man or woman for us. There are a few stats you look at that say home advantage is worth a few points. I am not sure many of their boys have had the opportunity to play here. So it’s a good challenge for us, to see where we’re at.” People were talking in similar terms about England prior to the visit of Ireland to Twickenham in the Six Nations, only for Charlie Ewels’ early red card to facilitate a 32-15 Irish win. On that day, though, the 27-year-old Genge had some scrummaging joy opposite the celebrated Tadhg Furlong and, with Leicester having earned more scrum penalties in Europe this season than anyone else, is again looking to set a no-nonsense tone. “We came up trumps at the scrum last time at Twickenham but by no means does that mean it is going to happen again. Tadhg is brilliant, he is obviously a British & Irish Lion twice and he is a world-class international. I’ll put my best foot forward and hopefully he meets me in the middle.” Nor does Genge reckon the English were too far short in other areas until their numerical disadvantage ultimately told in the final quarter. No one doubts the quality of Leinster’s Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris or the sharp young winger Jimmy O’Brien, all shortlisted for EPCR’s player of the season, but in the shape of Genge, Julian Montoya, Jasper Wiese and Tommy Reffell there is an undeniably steely core to Tigers as well. While the visitors, with James Ryan and Ronan Kelleher both starting, will look to pick away at the seams of Leicester’s defensive curtain and retain possession before striking with near-surgical precision, the Tigers will be focussed on disruption. Line speed, lineout homework and aerial pressure will all be key weapons, as will the continuing desire to channel the continuing emotion generated by the recent retirement of their former captain Tom Youngs. Genge and Youngs, in the early days of their relationship, were not natural bedfellows. “Off the pitch we really didn’t see eye to eye on a lot of things. Farmer boy meets city boy … I was quite chopsy as well and we just didn’t get on too well.” Gradually, though, they came to recognise they shared the same broad objective, namely a mutual willingness to put their bodies on the line for the collective Tiger cause. That same unflinching esprit de corps is what distinguished the great Leicester sides who won back to back European titles in 2001 and 2002 and poses the biggest barrier to Leinster’s progression this year. In the past two seasons the Irish province have been disconcerted by the power of Saracens and La Rochelle respectively but, like Ireland, they are well marshalled with the ability to push on even further. There is also the small matter of their less stressful build-up, with their senior players not required for recent United Rugby Championship games in South Africa while their Leicester counterparts have mostly had to soldier on through. “The central contract system over in Ireland is very beneficial for them whereas we obviously don’t have that perk,” observes Genge. “We have got a lot of minutes in our legs but I think the emotional state of the boys will definitely be enough.” And therein lies the rugged beauty of this intriguing Anglo-Irish summit. Leicester are not yet the finished article but they are fit and efficient. Give them some momentum and they are reliably tough to beat. “If we do what we have done all year then I think we’re going to be all right,” confirms Genge. “We’re happy with how we’re progressing but I don’t think we’ve peaked yet.” Crucially, they also love a scrap. “One thing you know about the Irish boys is they have a lot of dog in them so they will be coming for that battle. We relish opportunities like that.” Time to crank up Ritchie Blackmore’s classic guitar intro – Daa-Daa-Daah, Daa-Daa-Daa-Daaah! – to 11 and unleash some hardcore ruck and roll.",Sport/Sport,Ellis Genge: ‘Leinster have got to come to our backyard.

5/7/2022,"When Papua New Guinean fashion designer Yaku Ninich wanted to use tapa designs inspired by those of her grandmother, in her work, she first had to ask her mother for permission. Ninich, who is based in the US, but has roots in both Oro and Morobe provinces says that not everyone respects the connection between these ancient designs and the Oro people. “Tapa designs in the last three years have been commercialised uncontrollably,” said Ninich. “I feel like it should be appreciated and used ethically hence I only make small batches in each of my designs so it’s desirable by many.” Tapa, a traditional tattooed fabric, is one of PNG’s most distinctive artefacts and is particularly important to Oro people with each local tribe having its own unique designs. The cloth has been worn by men and women for centuries, used as traditional attire for dancing, for rituals, as valuable gifts for exchange in ceremonies and for everyday use, wrapped around themselves like skirts. But Indigenous people are concerned that the fabrics have been increasingly appropriated by non-Oro designers. “Our tapa and tattoo designs are now used everywhere,” said Frank Ginari, a chief from the village of Jebo in Tufi. “People use money to come and buy here and go to other provinces or sell it to the world when tourists come. This should be restricted to the Northern Province. Just like Sepiks have their crocodile tattoos and the Eastern Highlands have their mud-men and these are restricted to these places. We from Oro cannot participate in those and so our tapa and tattoo should be the same. It should be illegal to take from us and use for financial gain.” To make the cloth, the bark of the mulberry tree is extracted, beaten and soaked until soft and malleable. The beaten tapa is then dried and smoothed out. At this stage the material almost resembles parchment paper and this is when the tattooing process begins. A paint-like substance is taken from the bark of a particular tree and is beaten until it is broken down to a chalk-like consistency. The colour depends on the age of the tree but typically varies from crimson red to earthy brown. Each design represents the rich history of each tribe; each symbol and curve is significant and allows the history to be preserved for generations to come. Over the years however, the designs have taken on newer variations to adapt to the modern world. “Traditionally, the corners of tapa designs are usually slanted or curved and or have round edges. Newer variations have sharper edges. These are popular with our customers so we make what they like,” says one stall owner at the craft market in Popondetta, the capital of Oro. The popularity of the tapa and tattoo designs have led to all kinds of adaptations, printed on to modern shirts, bags and dresses; with the arrival of the pandemic they can even be found on face masks. While there is no law that protects the traditional designs, it has long been a cause for concern for Oro’s governor, Gary Juffa. “It is a question that many cultures and identities face. It is the cost of doing business. What we as a province need to do and what I am exploring, is how do we patent our unique Oro tapa and designs, so that it is specific to our province and those who wish to use that image or that design must fulfil a certain criteria. “Even when you go back to the province, tribes and clans have their own specific designs which is never shared and if someone were to use another clan’s design without their permission, that is a big offence.” Appreciating or being inspired by tapa cloth and designs is welcome and often encouraged, but it becomes an issue when the designs are taken and used by a person not originally from the tribe or clan for commercial purposes. This is when appreciation turns into appropriation. “The more our tapa and the designs are borrowed or stolen, the more its value is lost. Everyone will have it and it won’t be sacred or special to us,” Ginari said. He fears that the tapa could go the same way as the facial tattoos that are traditionally given to women when they reach marriageable age but which are now rare. “It is a rite of passage. The tattoo is taken from her clan or tribe’s distinctive design. So what you will see on their tapa, is what she will have on her face. Once she does the tattoo, when she comes out, she is ready to leave the home and go to her husband’s home, or she simply just has that freedom to get married,” Ginari said. Dorah Misirit was initiated and had her face tattooed when she was just nine. “I can remember the pain very well. When my mother used the siporo thorn [from a lemon tree] to tattoo my face.” But though it had profound significance at the time, as she has moved away from Oro, she has found herself neglecting the tattoo and it has begun to fade. “Our tradition is to apply coconut oil every day to keep the design clear so it doesn’t fade, but I moved to the town and I have done away with that so it is gradually fading,” she said.",News/World news,‘Our designs are stolen’: the fight to keep sacred tapa in the hands of PNG’s Oro people,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/our-designs-are-stolen-the-fight-to-keep-sacred-tapa-in-the-hands-of-pngs-oro-people
5/7/2022,"Sunderland’s former owner Sir Bob Murray once likened the team’s home to a fabulous theatre, filled with wonderful audiences who were consistently let down by some awful actors. Alex Neil’s players are striving to prove exceptions to that rule and did not disappoint a crowd of 44,742 at the Stadium of Light. It was a record attendance for an English Football League playoff semi-final and the majority present delighted in watching Ross Stewart give Sunderland a slender advantage ahead of Monday night’s second leg in South Yorkshire. Granted, after a slow start, they should have extended their lead during a much improved second half but much as Sheffield Wednesday harbour genuine hope of turning the tie round, Neil has tightened the Wearsiders’ defence appreciably in recent weeks. Significantly Anthony Patterson, his goalkeeper, was not required to make a single serious save. Two hours before kick-off the amount of traffic slowing to a crawl on the main approach roads to the stadium felt reminiscent of the days when Sunderland were a Premier League club. By the time the game actually got under way, the ground had filled to near capacity and the atmosphere felt electric. As hope and fear collided in the minds of supporters of two of England’s dozier sleeping giants no one could be quite sure whether this sense of occasion would shock the players into life or simply leave them suffocated by the pressure of endeavouring to escape the third tier. Sunderland had lost only once in the 15 games since Neil succeeded the sacked Lee Johnson, winning eight times, but they retain a certain mental fragility of the sort which quite possibly dictates it was for the best when the Stadium of Light board ended a brief dalliance with the idea of Roy Keane returning to Wearside to replace Johnson. Although Neil’s side had plenty of early possession, Wednesday initially looked more composed, with Barry Bannan using his intelligence, experience and sheer nous to slow things down in midfield and persistently frustrate the home side’s attempts to build tempo and momentum. If Darren Moore could be pleased with the way in which his visiting team – configured in 3-5-2 formation – retained their shape and organisation for much of the first half, Neil would presumably have been disappointed with Sunderland’s failure to properly test Bailey Peacock-Farrell’s reflexes. Granted Patrick Roberts did unleash an early shot from the edge of the area but if flew tamely into the goalkeeper’s arms. With Sam Hutchinson, once of Chelsea, making some important early interceptions in his role as the left-sided component of Moore’s defensive trinity and his teammates evidently conscious that there was no point in taking too many risks ahead of Monday’s second leg at Hillsborough, stalemate set in. It started to turn elements of the crowd slightly impatient before wholesale nervousness intruded as Wednesday’s Liam Palmer crossed in Lee Gregory’s direction. In the event Moore’s No 9 failed to make a true connection and Patterson gathered easily but Sunderland had received a reminder that, quiet as they seemed here, Gregory and Saido Berahino have latterly been two of the division’s foremost strikers. Perhaps that near miss galvanised Neil’s players because, very shortly afterwards, they assumed a morale bolstering lead. With half-time beckoning a strangely hesitant Hutchinson appeared to get his feet in a horrible tangle as he attempted to make a routine clearance near the halfway line and, sensing opportunity, Stewart seized the moment, pinching possession from the mortified defender. It left the striker clean through accelerating towards goal and although Bailey-Farrell saved his initial shot, Stewart made no mistake in steering the rebound home from a tight angle. The celebratory roar was so loud it could probably be heard 15 miles up the road in Newcastle. Stewart’s 25th goal of the season seemed to infuse his teammates with new found confidence and, early in the second period, Alex Pritchard, once of Tottenham, sent a shot bending and dipping on to the crossbar. With Roberts de-stabilising Wednesday’s rearguard, the suddenly busy Peacock-Farrell tipped another Pritchard shot to safety while Danny Batth went close with a header. Moore replaced the still anonymous Berahino with Josh Windass but, still, Sunderland dominated. Roberts, once a Manchester City winger, directed a swerving shot fractionally wide but there were to be no more goals at the ground Murray built.",Sport/Football,Sunderland’s Stewart taps in for playoff lead against Sheffield Wednesday,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/sunderland-
5/7/2022,"Swiss politicians have voted against loosening the country’s banking secrecy laws, drawing criticism from the UN and campaign groups who said the laws will continue to harm press freedom. A notorious law known as article 47 makes it a criminal offence to disclose information about a bank’s clients, even if it is in the public interest. It means whistleblowers and journalists who report on potential wrongdoing can be prosecuted. Switzerland’s parliamentary subcommittee on the economy and taxes voted against amending the law on Friday, saying Swiss banks had strengthened their controls on money laundering and white collar crime, and were meeting international standards. “An amendment to the Banking Act would run the risk of encouraging public prejudgements against private individuals,” the subcommittee said in a statement, adding that no media has been convicted under the law. The subcommittee was reviewing the law in reaction to the Suisse secrets investigation into Switzerland’s second largest bank, Credit Suisse. The leak, which included data for 30,000 clients, revealed that the bank held accounts for individuals involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption, and other serious crimes, over decades. Switzerland’s extreme banking secrecy laws meant that journalists who took part in the investigation risked potential fines or even imprisonment. Swiss media could not take part as a result. While the Swiss parliament still intends to discuss the matter at a later date, the subcommittee’s refusal to back the changes dashed hopes that the amendments could be fast-tracked. The subcommittee’s failure to amend the law drew criticism from the UN special rapporteur for freedom of expression and opinion, Irene Khan. She told Der Spiegel and Tages-Anzeiger that she was disappointed and “will continue to press the government of Switzerland to repeal the banking law”. Khan plans to escalate the issue to the UN human rights council on 24 June. Denis Masmejan, the secretary general of Reporters Without Borders Switzerland, said: “We deplore this decision, but we do not lose hope that other parliamentary interventions will eventually change the lines. “The application of article 47 to the media is absurd and incompatible with the freedom of the press … It will have to be corrected in one way or another,” he added, saying the issue could eventually be addressed by the European court of human rights.",News/News,Swiss politicians vote against loosening notorious banking secrecy law,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/06/swiss-politicians-vote-against-loosening-notorious-banking-secrecy-law
