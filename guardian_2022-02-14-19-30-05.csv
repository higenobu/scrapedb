2/14/2022,"Mounting fears of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine triggered a global share sell-off on Monday, and prompted oil prices to hit a seven-year high. European markets followed Asian shares sharply lower, with the UK’s FTSE 100 down 160 points, or 2%, at 7,501 in morning trading. Travel-related stocks were hardest hit, including the British Airways owner, IAG, which was the biggest faller on London’s blue-chip index, down 7%. The jet engine maker Rolls-Royce was down 4%, as only five companies on the FTSE 100 made it into positive territory.  There were heavy falls across Europe, led by Germany’s Dax, which was down 3.7%. Italy’s FTSE MiB, France’s Cac and Spain’s Ibex all fell by about 3.5%. Heightened expectations of a Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted renewed fears of disrupted energy exports at a time when the market is already tight. It drove the price of Brent crude oil to above $96 (£71) a barrel for the first time since September 2014, before easing back to $94. Analysts are not ruling out a breach of the $100 mark as tensions rise, with the price of oil up 23% since the start of 2022. Natural gas prices also soared 4.9%. Russia is responsible for a third of Europe’s natural gas and about 10% of global oil production. “Just as the storm of Covid appeared to be receding, the growing expectation of an invasion of Ukraine is the fresh threat now unnerving investors,” said Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Energy markets are clearly on edge and if supplies are threatened there is a risk oil will shoot up even higher, adding price pressure for companies.” The falls in European shares prices followed a sell-off in Asia. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index fell by about 1.7%, while Japan’s Topix and South Korea’s Kospi closed 1.6% lower. It comes as western nations withdraw diplomatic and military personnel from Ukraine, while the UK has told nationals based there to leave. “Markets are preparing for the risk of war in Europe, and it’s adding to the complex of issues driving uncertainty and volatility in global markets currently,” said Kyle Rodda, an analyst at IG. “The concern is about the impact such a conflict will have on fragile energy markets, European economic growth, and the broader financial system if sanctions are slapped on Russia.”",News/Business,Global markets tumble as Russia-Ukraine tensions hit shares,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/global-markets-tumble-russia-ukraine-tensions-hit-shares-ftse-100
2/14/2022,"Ukraine has quashed suggestions by the country’s ambassador to Britain that it could drop its bid to join Nato to avoid war with Russia, ahead of a busy day of diplomacy with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, heading to Kyiv. Ambassador Vadym Prystaiko told BBC Ukraine that the country was willing to be “flexible” over its goal to join the Atlantic military alliance, a move the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has warned would be a trigger for war.  “We might – especially being threatened like that, blackmailed by that, and pushed to it,” Prystaiko said when asked if Kyiv could change its position on Nato membership. Ukraine is not a Nato member, but was promised in 2008 that it would eventually be given the opportunity to join, a move that would bring the US-led alliance to Russia’s border. In 2019, an amendment was adopted that enshrined the ultimate goal of Nato membership in the country’s constitution. A spokesperson for the country’s foreign minister quickly quashed the remarks, claiming Prystaiko’s words had been taken out of context. “Ambassador Prystaiko rightly noted in his interview that the prospect of Nato membership is established in the constitution of Ukraine, although Ukraine is currently not a member of Nato or any other security alliance,” wrote Oleg Nikolenko on Facebook. “The key for us is the issue of security guarantees. Undoubtedly, the best such guarantee would be the alliance immediately accepting Ukraine. But the threats to Ukraine exist here and now, so the search for security guarantees becomes a fundamental and urgent task. At the same time, no decision can be made that contradicts the Ukrainian constitution.” Asked whether or not Ukraine may reconsider its ambitions to join Nato, Prystaiko told the BBC in English: “No this is not and I am quite happy that I have this chance to clarify my position.” Asked again if Ukraine was shifting its bid to become a Nato member, he said: “No.” Prystaiko said the earlier BBC report was the result of a misunderstanding. “We are not a member of Nato right now and to avoid war we are ready for many concessions and that is what we are doing in conversations with the Russians,” Prystaiko said. “It has nothing to do with Nato, which is enshrined in the constitution. “It is not a delay to our ambitions to be in Nato – what we are talking about is that we are not in the family now so we have to look for something else like bilateral agreements with the UK, with the United States,” he said. “So on top of Nato, we are looking for some other arrangements which would allow us to survive at this particular ordeal right now.” Putin has voiced concerns that if Ukraine grows its ties with the alliance further, it could be made a launchpad for Nato missiles targeted at Russia. He had said Russia needed to lay down “red lines” to prevent that. He has also claimed that accepting Ukraine into Nato would lead to military action by Nato to reclaim the Crimea peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014. “Do you want France to go to war with Russia?” an angry Putin asked a French journalist during the press conference after his recent Kremlin meeting with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. “That’s what will happen!” The UK armed forces minister, James Heappey, told the BBC that the UK government did not believe that suggestions of Ukraine giving up its goal of Nato membership was official policy. He said on Sky News that “any diplomatic solution shouldn’t be something that compromises Ukrainian sovereignty” and the country’s right to choose to be a member of Nato. However, he added that it was a decision for Ukraine to make, and that the UK would support whichever choice it made because “that’s what sovereignty is”. He cited the example of Serbia as a country that is not a Nato member but with which the UK has close ties.",News/World news,Ukraine quashes suggestion it could drop Nato plans to avoid war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/ukraine-quashes-suggestion-it-could-drop-nato-plans-to-avoid-war-with-russia-putin
2/14/2022,"As the French New Wave was starting to crest, and with the Cuban missile crisis just under a year away, Soviet film-maker Mikhail Romm directed what might have been the nuclear physicists’ version of Jules et Jim. This was the very intriguing Nine Days in One Year, now restored for its 60th anniversary. It’s a poignant love triangle, a story of broken hearts represented, in a rather David Nicholls-ish device, by the events of nine separate days over one year in the romantic lives of those whose duty was to the Soviet motherland – and to the great cause of the USSR gaining nuclear power. Dmitri Gusev, played by Aleksey Batalov, is a dedicated scientist working on thermonuclear physics in Siberia, whose work has for years taken him away from his humble family in the country. His more playful and worldly scientist friend Ilya (Innokenty Smoktunovsky) is back in Moscow. They are both in love with the same woman: the passionate, focused, beautiful scientist Lyolya (Tatyana Lavrova). At the beginning of the story, Lyolya and Ilya are engaged to be married, but a visit to her former lover Dimitri reveals to Lyolya his heroic dedication and the fact that he has endangered his life with potentially fatal irradiation. Aware of a certain kind of patriotic and personal vocation, Lyolya nobly resolves to marry Dimitri instead, but Ilya, masking his feelings with a certain kind of cynical gaiety, remains in their lives, perhaps sensing Lyolya’s frustration and unhappiness in her marriage.  There is a dark, shadowy expressionism in the film, an occult sense of mystery and danger in the underground corridors of the lab. Irradiation is maybe a metaphor for lovesickness, but perhaps the symbol only works if we understand love to mean love of science, or love of country. This is a story of people who unquestioningly sacrifice personal considerations for the Soviet nuclear cause, and yet this lost love looms alongside the Soviet Union’s nuclear destiny with equal potency.  Nine Days in One Year is released on 15 February on Klassiki.",Arts/Film,Nine Days in One Year review – enduringly powerful Soviet nuclear power drama,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/nine-days-in-one-year-review-enduringly-powerful-soviet-drama
2/14/2022,"“At what point do you think a relationship becomes a long-term relationship?” I ask my boyfriend, while sitting on the toilet having a post-dinner wee. He is in front of the mirror, trimming the single thick black hair that grows out from a mole on his cheek. Our son is in the bath next to us, squirting water from one stainless steel mixing bowl into the other using a Calpol syringe. “About here,” he says, gesturing towards the room, past my naked thighs, with a pair of nail scissors.  After nearly two years of intermittent lockdowns, working from home, reduced opportunities for travel, socialising and, in many cases, making money, and more illness, a lot of long-term relationships are looking a little tired, a little frayed. Tempers have run short; desire has faded. Especially on this most “romantic” of days, many us will be thinking that we need to address things. To freshen up. To repair. This calls for more than a box of chocolates and a bunch of flowers. But where to start? I’ve been gleaning advice from those who have gone before me – from friends, relationship counsellors, old colleagues, writers and philosophers, even my family. Your partner is not psychic: they cannot know what you think and feel and want at every turn. Nor is your partner an extension of you: they will frequently and unconsciously contradict you. So lower your expectations and try, as much as possible, to be kind. Standing at the hob, cooking yet another vat of soup (my partner and I have both decided that we need to eat fewer meals centred on butter and flour), I re-read Alain de Botton’s famous New Yorker essay Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person: “We need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us – and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. But none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce. Choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for.” I add some salt. And a knob of butter. Well, come on… My sister’s dad (who, for the genealogists in the room, is not my dad) once told me that people don’t break up over big things; they break up over how they talk to each other. Yes, in the end, your partner might sleep with someone else or steal your rent. But in most cases, the damage is done when you stop saying goodbye at the end of phone calls, stop saying thank you for dinner, stop asking the other person how their day was. However, blaming someone else’s behaviour is unlikely to change it. “People could really do with saying what they need, not what they think the other partner should do,” says Relate counsellor Josh Smith, who has been working with couples and families for more than five years. “Also, set a time and space when you’re going to talk about things but give it a time limit. A person who is feeling anxious might want to talk about an issue, but their partner might be more inclined to avoid difficult conversations and worried it will go on for ever. So you could say: ‘Let’s talk for half an hour and then stop.’” Smith also recommends giving yourself a timeout during those exhausting, essential conversations. “When our nervous system gets very aroused, we might say things we don’t mean, or not be able to say very much at all and disconnect emotionally. Being able to take a timeout, with a planned time to return to [the discussion], will help you listen.” When you hear counsellors talk about their clients, says Smith, the one thing that comes up time and time again is that they wish they’d come sooner – before the fight-or-flight response got so ingrained and the conflict so advanced that partners could no longer hear each other. So, to use a rather threadbare analogy, maybe treat relationship counselling like going to the gym: something that you use regularly to keep things healthy, to nip small problems in the bud, rather than turn to when things have seriously gone to seed. It is a privilege that many people can’t afford, of course, but it might also be money well spent. Sex is a pretty fundamental (and free) way to cement intimacy in a relationship. It can also act as a microcosm for the relationship: when people are feeling stressed, anxious, avoidant, low in self-esteem, bored or overlooked, it will almost inevitably lead to a drop-off in bouncing bedsprings. “For most of the couples I see, sex is an issue,” says Smith. “It’s not unusual for people in long-term relationships to have very little sex.” Well, who’d have guessed? “But that’s not a problem if it’s not a problem,” he adds. “Don’t let normative ideas about sex get in the way.” That doesn’t mean you have to give up just yet. When I asked my family WhatsApp group how to reboot a long-term relationship, one cousin replied: “Actively listen, be nice to each other and have sex even in times you might not feel like it (and then remember how much you do actually like it).” If you still need a little boost, remember what the psychotherapist Esther Perel says about desire in her Ted Talk, The Secret to Desire in a Long-Term Relationship: “If there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it’s ‘to have’. And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is ‘to want’.” The journalist Katie Antoniou puts it like this: “Go to a party and watch your partner flirt with other people and remember why you find them hot. And flirt with other people and remember people find you hot. Then go home together.” One of the great challenges in a long-term relationship is judging how much time to actually spend together. “During the pandemic, I noticed that people’s lives became a bit enmeshed,” says Smith, in possibly the greatest understatement of 2022. “Having different experiences and being able to bring those back into the relationship can be really healthy.” As Perel points out: “We come to one person, and we are basically asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide.” We want security, companionship, perhaps children, a best friend, a trusted confidante, a red-hot lover and someone to help us fulfil our daily domestic tasks. This is, probably, an unfair expectation of any single person. Put too many eggs in the long-term partner basket and cracks are going to show, if not yolk and leaking albumen. So don’t be afraid to look outside your relationship for other connections. It is not a criticism of your romantic relationship to go on holiday, share childcare, work, go to dinner, play football and watch films with other people. And, whether it’s a hobby, a shed or a separate bed, don’t be afraid to carve out a private sphere within your relationship. My greatest – and possibly only – bit of advice about sustaining a long-term relationship is to share a bed but have two separate duvets. The Germans, as is so often the case, have the answer. “Long-term relationships aren’t like warm baths; they’re like holding a tiger by the tail.” I’m on the phone to a friend who has been in his current relationship – I say “current” because, honestly, who am I to say? – for a mere 43 years. When it comes to relationship advice, as he admits, his understanding of dating, casual sex, breakups and asking people out is minimal. “She moved in when I was 19 and that was it, really.” But he is rather useful on the long-term front. “There are two main approaches, as I see it,” he says. “There is the passive state, which some people can find very sustaining, when it would basically be such a faff to split up that you’re staying together.” I think of my mortgage and our son and the fact that I still cannot replace my brake pads. “Or there is the active approach, where you’re always opting in. That’s what I chose.” The reason he and his partner didn’t marry for the first 42 years of their relationship, he says, is that they always wanted to know that they were together because they were choosing to be so. “I quite liked the jeopardy,” he says. “It’s a constant dialogue between exhilaration and exhaustion. At any time, I could have walked away. We had made no promise; there was no contract. Which meant that, every day, I knew I was there because I wanted to be there.” But what about the days when you don’t want to be there, I ask, picking a used teabag off the lid of the compost bin and putting it into the compost bin. “Well, that’s when the exhaustion comes in,” he says. “And you have to have those conversations about where you are and what you want.” A priest once told me that, over a lifetime, you will be married several times – and if you’re lucky, that will be to the same person. Children, work, where you live, money, health: the things that change your life will change your relationship too. So do the work to make those changes happen with, and in parallel to, your partner. Talk to each other about the ways you are developing and how you can adapt the dimensions and texture of your relationship to fit. Few of us would really want to be the person we were 10 years ago (in my case: single, recently redundant and staying in my mum’s spare room), so don’t expect your partner or your relationship to be held in aspic either. It is also worth pointing out that the things that bring you stress outside your relationship – money worries, illness, unemployment, housing insecurity, the demands of parenting, grief and moving home – will create stress within your relationship. So check if there are things you can do to improve your own situation before blaming your partner. Date nights worked for the Obamas, who once famously flew to New York, took a limo to dinner, watched a Broadway show and then flew home all in one night, during his presidency. And it was noticeable to me that the first time my partner and I spent a night away together since our son was born four years ago, we ended up not only sleeping in a bedroom covered in photographs of someone else’s whippets, but getting engaged. It doesn’t have to involve money, travel or Instagram. Time spent together away from your usual domestic coexistence – even if it’s just a swim, or a train journey, or a trip to a new launderette – can make a huge difference to how you see your partner. Finally, having picked up my partner’s socks from the floor, made the bed, rehung the damp, onion-smelling towel he had flung in a heap over the door, and wiped the peanut butter off my forehead, I asked my old English teacher for his advice. This, after all, is the man who taught Philip Larkin’s An Arundel Tomb, with its description of the stone earl and his lady countess, who rigidly persisted, “linked, through lengths and breadths of time”. More to the point, he’s been with his partner since they met at a party aged 20, more than 40 years ago. He must, I reasoned, have some ideas about what sustains and revives a long-term relationship. The reply comes back mere minutes later: “Amnesia, dogged optimism, a robust and shared sense of the contemptibility of public figures, alternating phases of heartfelt loyalty and shameless disloyalty with regard to friends and birth families, lonesome sheds with tools in them, compatible levels of existential angst, sunsets, recreational stimulants, utterly selfish projects, wholly unshared obsessions, a poor sense of smell, frequently sleeping in separate beds, frequently sleeping together, children, finding each other ridiculous, plant life, lakes, oceans, rock pooling, books, solvency, knowing who’s better at what, dreaming of elsewhere, avoiding all board games and exercising dictatorial authority over territories in different areas of daily mundanities.” His wife, he later tells me, probably had a better list. I would happily marry either of them. Oh, and one final note: in all my research, nobody mentioned shutting the door when you’re on the toilet. But I’d say give it a try.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Get into bed and see what happens’ – and nine other tips to revive a tired relationship,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/14/get-into-bed-and-see-what-happens-and-nine-other-tips-to-revive-a-tired-relationship
2/14/2022,"Donald Trump has endorsed rightwing Republican candidates who support his baseless claims of a stolen election for key posts in Michigan, raising the prospect of a Trumpist take over of how the key battleground state might run its elections. Trump and his allies are backing numerous candidates in the coming midterm elections across the US, including in other vital states like Arizona and Georgia.  But his intervention in the emblematic “rust belt” state of Michigan raises particular eyebrows due to its role in helping Trump to win in 2016, before flipping back to the Democrats in 2020 and helping oust him from office. The former US president and his close ally My Pillow CEO, Mike Lindell, are giving strong backing to a Michigan lawyer and key promoter of debunked election fraud charges who is seeking the Republican nod to be the state’s next attorney general. Trump plans to hold a fundraiser for lawyer Matthew DePerno on 8 March at his Florida Mar-a-Lago club, where Lindell told the Guardian he will speak to boost DePerno’s chances to be the Republican to take on Michigan’s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel. Kristina Karamo, a community college professor who also peddled conspiracy theories about election fraud and never held elected office, has gotten Trump’s backing to be the Republican secretary of state candidate to challenge incumbent Democrat Jocelyn Benson in the fall elections. The secretary of state plays a crucial role in overseeing elections and Trump loyalists are investing heavily to capture several of these posts this year. And early this month, Trump spoke at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago for the gubernatorial campaign of conservative commentator and business woman Tudor Dixon who has backed a vaguely defined “forensic audit” of the state’s election results which Joe Biden won by 154,000 votes. Although Trump called Dixon “very special”, he’s not yet made an official endorsement and she is one of twelve Republican candidates seeking to be the next governor. Trump’s varying embraces of DePerno, Karamo and Dixon is emblematic of how he is helping candidates who repeat his false charges that he lost due to widespread fraud and who could potentially help Trump sway results in key states should he run again in 2024. According to a report from the election watchdog group States United Action, at least 11 candidates who have denied the 2020 results are valid are running for AG posts in 10 states, and at least 21 election deniers are trying to win secretary of state races in 18 states, as of the end of January. “Statewide leaders from both parties who protected the will of the voters in 2020 are being challenged by election deniers,” said Joanna Lydgate, the CEO of States United Action. “Those candidates are campaigning on lies and conspiracy theories in determining whether the will of the voters is upheld – a dangerous contradiction.” Both DePerno and Karamo have already garnered checks for $5,000 dollars from a Trump super PAC, according to public records. A Michigan Republican convention in April will decide which candidates get on the fall ballot to take on Democratic opponents, and an August GOP primary will choose the party’s gubernatorial candidate to oppose incumbent Gretchen Whitmer. The Trump super PAC overall backed a total of 14 Michigan candidates who challenged the 2020 results and roped in $65,000 dollars from the PAC – more than any other state except Texas – according to campaign data. DePerno’s candidacy has been especially controversial given his legal efforts promoting false fraud charges in a lawsuit against 23,000 person Antrim county. The DePerno lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of a local realtor, sought to obtain a forensic audit, but was rejected last May when a judge noted that an audit had been done and dismissed the suit which alleged election machines were purposely designed to produce fraud. Antrim county, a Republican stronghold, was won by Trump after a preliminary tally that Biden won the county was quickly found wrong due to a clerical error, and corrected. Some of DePerno’s fundraising to help fund audits in Michigan and Arizona, and apparently pay for personal legal expenses, have prompted scrutiny for their size and unknown donors. One “Election Fraud Defense Fund” that DePerno used reportedly raked in $384,000 as of last July, and had an overall goal of $1m some of which was expected to pay for a Michigan audit. Lindell told the Guardian he has not donated funds to DePerno’s legal efforts or campaign and that he met DePerno when the lawyer was featured in Lindell’s film “Absolute Proof” that early last year drew criticism for promoting dubious theories about the 2020 election results. After the movie came out, DePerno and his family received “threats” according to Lindell, which prompted him to give the lawyer “about $20,000 for security”. Lindell has endorsed a few other candidates for attorney general and governor posts in states such as Arizona, Georgia and Texas who echo Trump’s false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. When Trump endorsed DePerno last fall he dubbed him a “super lawyer”, claiming falsely that he “exposed so much fraud in Antrim county, and many more places, in the 2020 elections”. The Trump bash next month at Mar-a-Lago to help DePerno could raise tens of thousands of dollars for his campaign coffers, according to reported ticket prices. For $25,000, a donor can get a photo standing next to Trump and DePerno, while for $10,000 dollars an attendee can have a photo taken next to Lindell and DePerno. Those funds could prove useful: a Detroit News poll last month showed DePerno running behind Tom Leonard, who Nessel defeated in 2018, and who is hoping to challenge her again. According to the poll, Nessel led both Leonard and DePerno. Although Trump’s backing for DePerno seems to have drawn the most scrutiny, Karamo and Dixon have also generated controversies. Karamo has said that Trump was the real winner of Michigan in 2020, and used her podcast on 7 January to push conspiratorial and false charges that far-left anarchists led the assault on the Capitol. Last October, Karamo was one of several secretary of state candidates from various states who have embraced Trump’s election lies to speak at a Las Vegas meeting that featured people with QAnon conspiracy links. Although Trump hasn’t formally endorsed Dixon, who has worked in sales and customer service at a steel company her father launched, Dixon has made no secret of her backing for Trump and hopes that he will bless her campaign. “I think that we would be kidding ourselves if we didn’t say that his endorsement will absolutely frame every race in America,” she said last August. Other Republican gubernatorial aspirants are also angling for Trump’s backing including ex-Detroit police chief James Craig who met with Trump last fall. With Trump backed candidates competing in Michigan and many other states, Lydgate of States United Action warned that it’s not a given any more that candidates for high office believe in “free and fair elections … the American people need to pay close attention to those races”.",News/US news,Alarm as Trump backs ‘big lie’ candidates for key election posts in Michigan,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/election-deniers-michigan-elections-donald-trump
2/14/2022,"Istart with my body in stillness: my eyes closed, my head bowed, my sternum soft, my pelvis weighted, my knees supple, my legs wide. The soles of my feet touch the dance floor. I widen my toes and my metatarsals, opening up the pathways between the Earth and my heart. I soften my joints – my ankles, my knees, my hips –making more space for freedom and possibility. I take in the deepest breath, expanding my lungs and rib cage to capacity, until I can feel the tiny intercostal muscles between my ribs begin to stretch. As I exhale, I allow my body to move as it needs. A small sway moves through my spine. My arms follow behind like fabric in the wind, sequencing from my shoulders to my fingertips. My pelvis starts to rise and fall, swelling and crashing like ocean waves, forcing my legs to follow suit to manage the momentum. I feel my thighs begin to awaken to the glorious burn of activity. It feels good. As my body continues on its journey, I feel those first beads of sweat arise: along my hairline, in between my breasts, on the small of my back. An indication that I am warming and opening.  I bring my attention to the music playing. Layers of percussion cue my body to get wide, get low, get deep, get earthy. I feel the urge to lean into tension … to say yes to the arrest of my muscles, then to break it apart, and arrest again. My shoulders rise to my ears, my spine curves forward, my biceps flex, my knees bend deeply, my fingers ball into fists. An explosion comes in the music. My arms and legs respond, erupting from my centre, sending me hurtling through the air, across the space. I land and feel my feet immediately connected to rhythm, digging and trudging forward as if the dance floor is soil. I let my body get lost in this foot chant that it’s building, enjoying the ride of the beat. Another explosion comes in the music. My feet slide outwards, escaping from underneath me, leaving me straight-legged, wide, splayed, cracked open, vulnerable with only my palm touching the Earth. I hold there and feel my abs begin to quake. I place my other hand to the Earth and follow the urge to crawl forward, feeling like a human morphing into an animal, uncomfortable and ripe with tension. I pause, hunched over the floor, like a cat ready to pounce. Then I exhale, I soften, melting into the floor, releasing that movement idea from my body. My breath is heavy and quick. Sweat rolling and dripping down my face and neck. I can taste the salt of it, the work of it. I relish in the discomfort, knowing that this is where I must go for honesty. I lie there in stillness, memorising the feeling, waiting to arise and go again.

On the pretext of annihilating the painful memories of his ex, Joel relives them, learning not just how much this elective amnesia will cost him, but also how much happiness is locked in the permafrost of the past, waiting to be thawed out. Inasmuch as any film this entertaining can be, it’s really an exhortation to listen to what your future self is screaming at you from another dimension right now: to turn off your TV, wrap your lover in your arms and notice this present, perfect moment as it’s happening.

Charming treasure hunter Nathan Drake has settled down with Elena, a fellow adventurer and photographer. The two both miss the excitement of their former lives, but we play through a moment of adorable domestic bliss when Nate picks up a PlayStation controller and proceeds to be absolutely terrible at Elena’s favourite game. Listening to their affectionate ribbing, this feels like a couple who have actually been through things. Uncharted 4 ends up being about a few different kinds of love – for family, for adventure, for your partner – and how that love can change us.

Its maker, Simeon Solomon (1840-1905), was a Victorian outlier, depicting gay desire for a public audience. Tragically though, he fell from art world grace following an arrest for having sex with another man in a public lavatory. Looking towards her viewers, Erinna’s hesitancy – the raised knee, the stilling hand – suggests a fear of exposure.

These 60 uproarious minutes find the Croydon comic reviewing her life so far in love and sex, from presenting smutty TV to flings with foot-fetishists and smack-addled bankers. Throughout, Hughes sends up and celebrates in lurid terms her will to power, glory and sexual success.

2/14/2022,"The Australian federal police commissioner has sounded a warning about disinformation ahead of the federal election campaign, telling a parliamentary inquiry police will use the “full force” of the law when conduct reaches a criminal threshold. Reece Kershaw used an opening statement to a Senate estimates committee on Monday night to tell senators he was concerned about the impact of disinformation “on the integrity of our institutions and the election itself”.  The commissioner said police were alert to heightened security risks, including domestic protests, as well as the risks of foreign interference and disinformation that incited violence. He said the objective was “protecting our community, high-office holders, our democratic institutions and democratic values”. Kershaw’s intervention followed a public vow last week by the director general of Australia’s domestic spy agency to counter any attempts by other countries to interfere in the upcoming federal election. The Asio boss, Mike Burgess, also revealed in his annual threat assessment a “recent” meddling plot had been disrupted. The police commissioner said during the past two months, Australian Capital Territory policing and the AFP had been maintaining public order in Canberra “in challenging circumstances”. Protests against vaccination mandates have been escalating in the national capital. Burgess warned last week more “angry and alienated Australians” could turn to violence after being exposed to “an echo chamber” of extremist messaging, misinformation and conspiracy theories during the coronavirus pandemic. When it came to foreign interference, Kershaw told senators the AFP was working closely with Asio. He said police were “aware of increased espionage and foreign interference threats”. The police commissioner noted the AFP had worked with Asio last year “to bring an individual before the courts on the first foreign interference charges laid since the new offence was introduced in 2018”. In November 2020, police charged Duong Di Sanh, also known as Sunny Duong, with preparing to commit foreign interference. Duong has previously vowed to fight the charge , saying he had “nothing to hide” and rejecting allegations he had worked on behalf of the Chinese Communist party. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AFP commissioner noted on Monday that foreign interference was an invisible crime for most Australians “but it has the potential to affect every Australian because it erodes democracy and our institutions”. Kershaw said Australia’s counter foreign interference taskforce had achieved a number of successful disruptions, “most significantly in relation to democratic institutions” during the past 18 months. In relation to disinformation, Kershaw noted police had charged a person with computer, carriage service and electoral offences, for their alleged role in an offensive spam email campaign and sending over 23m messages during the 2019 Wentworth and 2020 Eden-Monaro byelections. The individual will be sentenced later this year. The updates from the spy agency and the police chief come as the Morrison government is using the remaining parliamentary sitting weeks to set up an election contest where national security will be a significant theme. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, generated a furore last week when he motioned to the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, in parliament last week and declared: “We now see evidence that the Chinese Communist party, the Chinese government, has … made a decision about who they’re going to back in the next federal election, and that is open and that is obvious, and they have picked this bloke as that candidate.” The Nine newspapers last Friday reported “multiple security sources” had said a Chinese intelligence service was behind a recently disrupted foreign interference plot that had “attempted to bankroll [New South Wales] Labor candidates in the upcoming federal election”. Albanese said Asio had not raised any concerns with him about Labor’s federal election candidates. He characterised Dutton’s conduct as “desperate”, given the major parties had the same position on Beijing’s trade sanctions, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, human rights concerns, foreign interference and cybersecurity. On Monday, the Speaker of the lower house, Andrew Wallace, cautioned Dutton against repeating last week’s claim, ruling that it had been out of order. But the Speaker did not insist Dutton withdraw his remarks.",News/Australia news,"AFP on alert for domestic protests, disinformation and foreign interference as election looms",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/afp-on-alert-for-domestic-protests-disinformation-and-foreign-interference-as-election-looms
2/14/2022,"The first literary work to emerge from Myanmar since the military seized control of the country a year ago reveals the altruism and courage of a new generation of writers, its editor has said. Picking Off New Shoots Will Not Stop the Spring is an anthology of poems and essays, many of which were written during the military crackdown after last February’s coup. Others date from 1988 to 2020.  Since the coup, “scores of poets have been persecuted, executed or killed in resistance”, said Ko Ko Thett, poet and co-editor of the anthology. The deaths of Myint Myint Zin and K Za Win in March 2021 sent shock waves through Myanmar, he said. In the book’s introduction, Ko Ko Thett and co-editor Brian Haman wrote: “Many poets … have been jailed for taking part in the protests. We are honoured to include poems by a number of these poets, including some best-loved poems by Khet Thi who died at the hands of the junta’s inquisitors on 8 May.” After the military seized control, hundreds of people, including children, were killed in street protests. Security forces used water cannon, rubber bullets and live ammunition to disperse protesters. The military imposed restrictions, including curfews and limits to gatherings. “In the wake of the military’s overthrow of Myanmar’s democratically elected government in February 2021, we found the online literary outpouring of outrage, grief and dissent particularly generous, altruistic and courageous,” said the book’s editors. The relatively recent introduction of the internet and social media in Myanmar became a powerful vehicle for the circulation of what Ko Ko Thett terms “witness writing”. “The removal of so much of the censorship following the 2010 election in the so-called ‘transitional Myanmar’ coincided with the introduction of the internet and social media,” he told the Guardian. “Many poets and writers became active online overnight. In the instantaneity and virality of social media, protest poets who posted their poems online got easily known, easily identified and easily tracked down.” In the decade after, the internet became a “major vehicle for poetry and voices of protests,” he said. Witness writing was distinct from protest writing, said Ko Ko Thett, who was a student activist in Yangon in the 1990s and now lives in the UK. “All protest writings may be witness writings, but not all witness writings are protest writings. Witness writing is more subjective and does not usually have an explicit political agenda – however politicised it might be or become.” The book’s editors said there was an “urgently felt need to preserve these online writings in a more durable and enduring format. Not only does this corpus of writing demonstrate the power and possibilities of the written word when faced with the barrel of a gun, but it also reveals Burmese writing to be aesthetically accomplished and significant.” Among the pieces in the anthology is Portrait of the Need for Oxygen by Zeyar Lynn, which compares the suffocating grip of the military on the country with that of Covid on an individual. Residual Lives by Mi Chan Wai is a first-hand account of the terror the poet felt in her neighbourhood on the outskirts of Yangon. In Whose Footfall is Loudest, Thawda Aye Lei described how “flip-flops had always been important witnesses to our revolutions”. In 2021, “every time a group of people were chased by guns and batons, dozens of ownerless flip-flops would be left abandoned on the street … When the security forces were gone, people picked them up and organised them in pairs for their owners to come and collect them.” Last year was extraordinarily tragic for Myanmar, and there was “no sign of abating conflict in the year to come, if not years”, said Ko Ko Thett. “The stage is set for protracted conflicts, poverty beneath human dignity, human suffering and environmental degradation.” Picking Off New Shoots Will Not Stop the Spring was published on 29 January",News/Global development,Myanmar’s first literary work since coup reveals ‘courage and altruism’ of writers,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/14/myanmar-first-literary-work-since-coup-reveals-courage-and-altruism-of-writers
