4/29/2022,"How much does Waffle House pay its workers? That question is getting plenty of discussion on TikTok, thanks to one woman’s viral video. The clip comes courtesy of a 20-year-old Waffle House employee named Nirajah Taylor (@nirajah.t). According to her post, the TikToker has been working at the 24/7 diner chain since she was 16. In her video, Taylor shares photos featuring large stacks of money and checks with tips of up to $100. The clip took many viewers by surprise, although many Waffle House employees jumped in to comment that the job can be surprisingly lucrative. Been at the same job since I was 16 🙂 #fyp #foryou #wafflehouse #foryoupage Taylor’s clip is part of an ever-growing trend on the app, in which users post transparently about their jobs and pay. Recently, other TikTokers have shared similar videos, including NFL water boys, notaries and even online trivia hosts. Although Taylor’s post doesn’t specify exactly how much she makes, it does make it clear she’s happy with her situation. She even asked viewers to tag the official Waffle House TikTok account in their comments. While the earnings surprised many users, some said they’d learned firsthand how well the job can pay. “I miss working there,” one user wrote. “Was nothing to make $1,000-$1400 a week.” “I believe this 100%,” another agreed. “I know the ppl that work there make good money,” another added. “I be in there drunk tipping like I’m rich all because of the conversation.” Other commenters pointed out that some Waffle House employees earn minimum wage. However, there are countless roles at the company that pay much more than the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour. According to Indeed, the average grill cook makes $12.91 an hour, while the average server makes $13.33. Meanwhile, there are managerial roles that pay salaries averaging close to $60,000 per year. Some TikTokers claimed that the real struggle is learning Waffle House’s “language.” As another viral TikTok recently showed, employees at the chain use a set of secret codes to communicate orders.

4/29/2022,"A leading Kremlin mouthpiece has warned that the West’s overt backing for Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory could lead not to Russia’s defeat but to the “total annihilation” of Ukraine. The warning from Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, came after further Ukrainian strikes overnight on the border city of Belgorod, a key supply center for Russian military forces in eastern Ukraine. “Explosions and air defense sirens in Belgorod,” Simonyan wrote early Thursday in a message on Telegram. “The Anglo-Saxons publicly encourage Ukraine to take their hostilities into Russian territory. And they give them means to carry that plan out. “What choice do you leave us, idiots? The total annihilation of what remains of Ukraine? A nuclear strike?” In Putinist circles the term “Anglo-Saxons” can be used as a bit of a catch-all for malign Western influences, but there appeared to be little doubt that Simonyan’s message was referring to Britain. British defence minister James Heappey prompted outrage in Moscow earlier this week when he said he thought it was “completely legitimate” for Ukrainian forces to strike against targets in Russia and it was “not necessarily a problem’” if they used weapons donated by Britain. The British military has actively trained Ukrainian forces since Russia annexed Crimea and sent special forces into eastern Ukraine in 2014. The U.K. has also supplied large amounts of arms, including valuable mobile anti-tank weapons. In an interview with Times Radio, Heappey said: “Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country. “That started a war between Ukraine and Russia, and in war Ukraine needs to strike into its opponent’s depth to attack its logistics lines, its fuel supplies, its ammunition depots, and that’s part of it.” Putin himself joined in the barrage in a speech to lawmakers in St Petersburg on Wednesday. “If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside, and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast,” he said. “We have all the tools for this, things no one else can boast of having now. And we will not boast, we will use them if necessary. And I want everyone to know that.” It is not the first time that Kremlin leaders or propagandists have warned of a nuclear conflagration, although the threats have become ever clearer and less veiled as the war drags on. When he ordered the invasion on Feb. 24, Putin warned that those who tried to stop Russia achieving its aims would face “consequences that you’ve never faced in your history”—which was taken to mean nuclear weapons. At that point, the invasion still appeared to be an almost comfortable imperialist adventure for Putin and his generals, who were super-confident that Ukrainian resistance would soon be snuffed out and the government of Volodymyr Zelensky ousted. But out-thought and outfought by better-prepared Ukrainian forces, the Russians suffered a humiliating setback in the battle for Kyiv. Forced to retreat, the Russian military is now focusing its might on areas of eastern and southern Ukraine, where it is making costly but grinding progress as it tries to encircle Ukrainian forces in the east and take full control of the Black Sea coast up to Odesa. The Ukrainian defence ministry said on Thursday that the Russians, who are now fighting under a single commander, were stepping up their offensives in both eastern Ukraine and in the south and “exerting intense fire” on all fronts. In the early battle for Kyiv, Russia suffered painful losses at the hands of Ukrainian light infantry and special forces, who used their knowledge of the terrain to take out Russian columns—leaving behind the oxidised remains of Russian tanks and fighting vehicles, identifiable only by the letter “Z”. Military experts say the latest phase of the war—just as crucial for Ukraine's survival as a nation—is more conventional in terms of warfare, fought on flatter and more open terrain with the power of each side's artillery key to success. A number of Western nations are sending hundreds of artillery pieces, plus tens of thousands of shells, to Ukraine. The Pentagon on Wednesday published pictures of dozens of 155-mm howitzers being loaded onto an aircraft at the March Air Reserve Base in California. The ever-increasing flow of weaponry into Ukraine presents a huge issue for the Russians, whose own munition factories are largely sitting idle for a lack of foreign-made components because of international sanctions. Hence the growing chorus of nuclear threats from the Kremlin and its mouthpieces. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

4/29/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden has failed to integrate the vast numbers of immigrants it has taken in over the past two decades, leading to parallel societies and gang violence, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Thursday, as she launched a series of initiatives to combat organised crime. Many Swedes were shocked earlier this month after violent riots left more than 100 police injured. The violence erupted after a Swedish-Danish politician burned the Quran at a rally and sought to hold more in several immigrant-dominated neighborhoods. Andersson blamed criminals and said both Islamism and right-wing extremism had been allowed to fester in Sweden, in unusually frank and self-critical comments. ""Segregation has been allowed to go so far that we have parallel societies in Sweden. We live in the same country but in completely different realities,"" Andersson told a news conference. The number of people in Sweden born abroad has doubled in the last two decades to 2 million, or a fifth of the population. Andersson's Social Democrats have been in power for 28 of the last 40 years, including the last eight. Andersson said she wanted to introduce local youth crime boards where social services and police could collaborate. She also proposed tools to make sure that youths stayed in schools and off the streets without the consent of parents. ""Integration has been too poor at the same time as we have had a large immigration. Society has been too weak, resources for the police and social services have been too weak,"" she said. Sweden, which holds a general election later this year, has radically tightened its immigration policies since taking in more people per capita than any other European Union country during the migration crisis in 2015. It now has one of the bloc's most restrictive policies. Human rights organisation Amnesty International has been critical of Sweden's tightening of policies, claiming it is causing human suffering and making integration even harder for immigrants.
