3/30/2022,"Some of the UK’s most threatened butterflies weathered a poor year in 2021 thanks to conservation efforts, annual survey results have shown. The woodland-loving heath fritillary has doubled in abundance in the past decade, although it is 90% down on 1980 levels. The silver-studded blue also did well, recording its best year since 1996. The restoration of lost habitats enabled these species to do well despite bad weather, including a cold, drenching May in England. The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, comprising almost half a million records, showed 2021 was a difficult year for overall butterfly abundance, ranking 28th of 46 years in records dating to 1976. Many common species struggled, including the green-veined white, which had its fourth worst year on record, and the large skipper, which had its fifth worst. Even some widespread species that have increased over the long term fared badly, with the ringlet recording its lowest numbers since 2012. “We’re delighted to be seeing some positive signs for species such as the heath fritillary, especially when the general long-term picture for UK butterflies is one of great decline,” said Richard Fox, an ecologist at Butterfly Conservation. “It reinforces the importance of managing and restoring habitat. The heath fritillary is a good example of a species that almost certainly would have gone extinct in Britain by now, if it wasn’t for conservation efforts.” These efforts include recreating woodland clearings that were once common when people practised coppicing. “There are also grounds for cautious optimism in the results of many other threatened species that are the focus of conservation action,” Fox said. “The black and brown hairstreaks both had a good year in 2021, as did the glanville fritillary, dingy skipper, adonis blue and chalk hill blue.” The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme uses data collected by volunteers from more than 2,900 sites across the UK. When the weather is suitable, the butterfly spotters walk a specified route each week from April to September. Butterfly populations fluctuate naturally from year to year, largely owing to the weather. The adult insects need warm, dry weather to fly, while caterpillars need to avoid drought, which can kill the plants they feed on. “They are cold-blooded creatures and rely on the warmth of the sun to warm up to become active,” said Fox. “So if it is really cold, they can’t fly, feed or find a mate. The incredibly bad May will have impacted some butterflies that were in the adult stage then, such as the holly blue.” The long-term trends for British butterflies are mainly driven by human activity, in particular destruction and degradation of natural habitats by intensive farming. Of the 54 species with long-term data in England, 20 show declines and 12 are more abundant. The pearl-bordered and small pearl-bordered fritillary, for example, are at just a third of their 1970s levels. “The wholesale destruction of natural habitat has largely stopped now in the UK,” Fox said. “But there is ongoing deterioration of habitat, even on nature reserves.” That was caused by lack of funding as well as pollution and pesticides from farming, he said. Scotland is bucking the trend, with 12 monitored species showing long-term increases in abundance compared with three showing long-term declines. “The main reason is because there are a whole bunch of butterfly species that are spreading northwards with climate change,” Fox said. Sarah Harris, at the British Trust for Ornithology, whose volunteers also collect butterfly data, said: “Butterfly species are indicators of the health of our natural environment and therefore can also be used to help understand and protect the wider ecosystem on which so many birds, mammals and other species rely.”",News/Environment,Britain’s butterflies bolstered by conservation efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/30/britains-butterflies-conservation-species-2021

3/30/2022,"Competition investigators raided the offices of outsourcer Mitie and are examining the emails of senior staff, after the Home Office raised concerns about suspected anti-competitive behaviour, the Guardian understands. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is examining the relationship between Mitie and US firm PAE, who operate a joint venture for the Ministry of Defence but were also competing to run Home Office immigration removal centres, at Derwentside, in Coutry Durham, and Heathrow. Mitie’s shares fell more than 10% earlier this month after it informed investors that the CMA was investigating the competition process, despite the company saying it expected to be “fully exonerated”. The firm appeared to focus on the Derwentside contract in its statement, blaming Home Office bidding rules for its withdrawal from the bidding. But a source said investigators were focusing more on a separate competition between Mitie and PAE for the Heathrow centre. Both companies were bidding on the immigration contract until PAE pulled out last year, leaving the way clear for Mitie. The Home Office subsequently referred both companies to the CMA, the Guardian understands. The CMA, which is investigating whether breaches of competition law took place, is now thought to be looking into the wider working relationship between the companies. Mitie and PAE are partners on a separate joint venture called Landmarc, managing firing ranges, training and explosives handling facilities for the Ministry of Defence. Landmarc is one of five companies providing the services to the MoD, as part of a £1.5bn framework agreement, which will be up for renewal in March 2024. CMA officials are understood to have raided Mitie’s offices, on the 12th floor of the Shard skyscraper in London, earlier this month. They seized documents and are understood to be reviewing emails, including those sent by senior staff. The Guardian understands that the CMA has not so far made a request to interview the Mitie chief executive, Phil Bentley. The Mitie CEO earned £2.7m in 2021, up from £2m the year before, thanks to a £1.1m cash bonus and a £622,000 share award. A spokesperson for Mitie referred the Guardian to its statement to the stock market, in which the company said it had “no case to answer” and expected to be “fully exonerated”. “Mitie strongly condemns anti-competitive practices and is co-operating fully with the CMA and the investigation,” the company said in its statement. PAE said on Tuesday that it believed the CMA’s investigation was “unfounded” but said it was fully complying with the regulator. “Not all of what you propose to say is factually accurate,” it added. A Home Office spokesperson declined to comment on whether the department had itself referred the two companies to the CMA. “The Home Office is aware the CMA has launched an investigation into two suppliers involved in the procurement of contracts for Heathrow and Derwentside immigration removal centres,” a spokesperson said. “The investigation does not have any impact on Mitie’s current Home Office contractual obligations. We are co-operating with the CMA and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.” London-headquartered Mitie is a major contractor to both the government and the private sector, running facilities such as cleaning, security and waste management. Its latest annual report for 2021 shows that it derived £1.1bn, about 42% of its revenue, from its work for local and central governments. Its contracts include helping run Covid-19 testing centres for the department of health, accommodation and airfield maintenance for the Ministry of Defence and security at Home Office buildings. PAE is based in Virginia and manages a host of US government contracts, including providing power at Nasa’s mission control at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas.

3/30/2022,"If you’re making a list of Things That Are Not Surprising, then today’s news that public satisfaction with the NHS has fallen to its lowest level since 1997, as revealed in the 2021 British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey, might be near the top. Satisfaction with the health service has plummeted, with just 36% declaring they are content. In the previous year’s survey, this figure was 53%. Such a 17-point drop is unprecedented over the history of this multi-decade census. More people (41%) are now dissatisfied with the NHS than satisfied, and this holds across all ages, income groups, sexes and political persuasions. It’s worth pointing out that you almost didn’t know about this. As part of the coalition government’s disastrous health reforms of 2010-12, Andrew Lansley removed the Department of Health’s funding for this survey. You don’t have to be politically partisan to wonder why a government department would want less public knowledge about satisfaction with its remit. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the health economist Professor John Appleby and colleagues, this source of data wasn’t lost: the independent King’s Fund thinktank stepped in to sponsor it. In any case, the causes of the collapse in NHS performance, which the public has clearly noticed, are not mysterious. But here’s the key thing: they can’t be entirely attributed to the pandemic. Clearly, Covid-19 didn’t help matters, with its huge impact of fatigue and trauma on the staff who battled through its waves. But it is a matter of fact that at the end of 2019 (ie before the pandemic), the NHS waiting list in England was 4.4 million people long. It is currently 6.1 million and rising, having grown from 2.4 million in 2015. The point is that Covid did not help with a pre-existing trend. The single biggest cause of the fall in performance is a lack of resources. The decade from 2010-19 saw the lowest increase in NHS funding since the first decade of the service’s history. The Cameron-Osborne austerity era has been very costly. The most important resource is, of course, NHS staff. The fact that the workforce shortage recently hit 110,000 (after having hovered around 100,000 for several years) is not reassuring; neither is the government’s continuing unwillingness to accept former health secretary Jeremy Hunt’s proposal to mandate a regular independent publication of NHS workforce needs, and the progress being made to meet them. When the current health bill returns to the House of Commons later this week, expect to see battle resume on this issue. The willingness of doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff to work overtime in evenings and at weekends to tackle the backlog (which happened under New Labour too) is also being hit by pension tax changes introduced by Osborne to offset the costs of making family homes worth up to £1m free of inheritance tax. This means that NHS staff working overtime can become liable for unpredictable and huge tax bills, which must be paid immediately, and which can exceed the extra money earned. So what is the government going to do to fix all this? The answer is, frankly, nothing. The NHS elective recovery plan recently announced by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, will not fix the backlog. It is a masterpiece of evasive language, characterised by lots of “ambition”, “guidance” and “best practice”. So creating 30% more NHS elective capacity over pre-pandemic levels by 2024-25 is an “aim”. Other aims include to “make progressive improvements on long waits, with a goal to eliminate waits of over one year by March 2025, and waits of over two years by July 2022”. All this allows for a lot of wriggle-room, obviously. In the same vein, there are commitments that by March 2025 (which lies beyond the latest date for the next general election), there will be no 52-week waits for elective care. But, again, we soon get to caveats: “These ambitions are important for improving outcomes for patients, but they of course depend on returning to and maintaining low levels of Covid-19, enabling the NHS to restore normalised operating conditions and reduce high levels of staff absence”. Covid-19 is still very much with us, along with restrictions on NHS capacity because of infection control measures. The BSA survey has some good news: the vast majority expressed high levels of support for the founding principles of the NHS: that it is free of charge when you need it (94%), primarily funded through taxation (87%) and available to everyone (84%). And we know from the New Labour health reforms of the 2000s that the NHS is perfectly capable of delivering on increasing access and reducing waiting lists, if it is adequately resourced. Let’s end with a prediction: expect some on the political right to come out shroud-waving that the NHS just can’t deliver. For all of the above reasons, we can safely ignore such foolish assertions. The NHS is in its current bad state of health because of the culmination of political choices, over the past dozen years, made by Conservative-led governments. The next general election, which the chancellor’s promised 1p income tax cut effectively guarantees will be in 2024, will be a referendum on many things: the state of the NHS will be high up on that list.

3/30/2022,"The conversations always started the same way. A woman would get a message from a social media user. It would say: “Can I tell you a secret?” The messenger often, but not always, appeared to be a friendly young woman, peppering the conversation with words such as “hun” and signing off with a kiss. But the messenger would also claim to have information about the woman’s life. The victim’s partner was cheating on her; a friend was talking behind her back. If the woman blocked the anonymous messenger, another appeared. If the woman stopped responding, she would get incessant calls from someone breathing down the phone. This stalking could go on for years. Sometimes, the stalker spread lies about the victims to her friends, family and colleagues: that she was having an affair with her boss, or even her stepdad. The stalker would hack into the victim’s social media accounts, or create fake accounts in her name. He would pose as the victim to have sexually explicit conversations. He would even send stolen intimate photographs of her. Victims lost friends, family members, relationships and professional opportunities. One terrified victim slept with a baseball bat in her hand. Another kept a samurai sword beside her bed. Some were diagnosed with depression and anxiety and needed medication. Nobody, except the stalker, knows how many victims there were. The Guardian has spoken to 10 survivors directly and each knew of another half a dozen or dozen women who had been targeted. “We’re going to have hundreds of victims,” says PC Kevin Anderson of Cheshire constabulary. The person responsible for all this suffering? A 30-year-old unemployed man from Northwich, Cheshire, called Matthew Hardy. For more than a decade, Hardy behaved with near impunity. “Every time his name comes up, I hear other names,” says Zoe Jade Hallam, 31, a model and mechanical operative from Lincolnshire who survived Hardy’s stalking. One force alone, Cheshire constabulary, was contacted about Hardy more than 100 times by 62 victims over an 11-year period. During Hardy’s years of stalking, he was arrested 10 times. But the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) appeared unable to put a stop to his offending. Until January 2022, that is, when Hardy was sentenced to nine years in prison for five counts of stalking. The average custodial sentence for stalking is under 17 months. “It’s the longest sentence we’ve ever heard of,” says Violet Alvarez of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, an anti-stalking charity. For survivors, the sentence was the news they had been waiting for. But why was Britain’s worst‑ever cyberstalker allowed to evade justice for so long? Hardy did not have a good time at school in Northwich. Melanie (not her real name), a 30-year-old HR worker who lives in Cornwall and was in his class in the mid‑00s, says: “He was bullied. People thought he was strange.” Gina Martin, 30, a women’s rights campaigner in London, was another schoolmate. She recalls feeling sorry for Hardy and trying to be kind. “He was isolated,” she says. “I used to make an effort to say hi.” Social media was in its infancy. In 2006, Facebook opened membership to anyone aged 13 or older – and British teenagers rushed to sign up to the platform. It was around this time that Hardy began to stalk his female classmates and girls from neighbouring schools. Melanie was one of his first victims. It started in 2009, when they were students at nearby sixth-form colleges. “A random person would add me on Facebook and start messaging me,” she says. “They’d say my boyfriend was cheating on me and they just wanted to let me know.” Melanie’s classmates were also getting messages. “We all banded together and found out it was Hardy. Every time he messaged us, we’d say: ‘You’re Matthew Hardy, go away.’” Melanie says that Hardy harassed about 25 girls from her school. In 2010, Hardy messaged Melanie again, after the death of her mother: “Need word about your mum asap x.” Hardy told Melanie that her mother had been cheating on her father and he was going to tell him. She reported him to the police. “I couldn’t handle it any more,” she says. “He was coming for my deceased mother.” The police, she recalls, “said: ‘We can’t do anything. It’s online. We don’t know who it is.’” Amy Bailey, another pupil from Northwich, was 16 when Hardy began stalking her, in 2011. “He’d call 50 times a day,” says Bailey, an admin worker who now lives a few miles outside the town. At the time, she worked in a garage in Northwich. Hardy would text her, telling her what she was doing. “One time, he said he saw me washing a car,” Bailey says. “Another time, he commented on the colour of my top. I went in and started crying.” She reported him to Cheshire constabulary, who at first told her to delete her Facebook account and block his number. But Cheshire constabulary did appear to take at least one victim seriously. In October 2011, Hardy pleaded guilty to hacking and harassing a former classmate, Samantha Boniface; he had hacked her Facebook account and impersonated her online. On one occasion, Boniface had been approached by a member of the public, who had asked if she was the girl who had been “talking dirty” to him. Hardy received a restraining order, a suspended prison sentence and 250 hours of community service. The conviction scarcely seemed to dent Hardy’s resolve. In 2013, he acquired a new victim: Gina Martin, his former schoolmate. “He’d set up profiles pretending to be me,” she says. “Every single day, I would wake up to messages from people saying: ‘Is this you? This person just added me.’” She realised that Hardy was responsible after speaking with former classmates and comparing messages. Martin grew to dread visiting her parents’ house in Northwich. “I knew he lived five minutes away,” she says. “When I’d walk places on my own, I’d put on a hat and put my hood up. I was always scared of him.” Bailey, too, was unravelling. “I was going insane,” she says. “I lost the plot. I went crazy. I accused someone at work of being him.” In 2013, Bailey contacted Cheshire constabulary again and provided officers with screenshots of the accounts that had been harassing her. One included Hardy’s real name. Hardy pleaded guilty to harassment and hacking and was given a suspended sentence and a restraining order. By 2014, Hardy had breached the restraining order and started stalking Bailey again. “I’d ring the police up and say: ‘He’s breaching the restraining order,’” she says. “They’d look into it, but nothing would happen.” She reported him for breaches of his restraining order in 2014, 2015 and 2017. Martin reported Hardy to Cheshire constabulary in 2016. In September, Hardy was arrested and interviewed under caution. Officers submitted Martin’s case to the CPS, but, in April 2017, it declined to bring it forward. “It was implied to me that, until someone got hurt or he stalked someone in person, there was nothing they could do about it,” Martin says. In June 2017, a man took a photograph up Martin’s skirt at a music festival in London. Police told her the incident wasn’t illegal. Martin campaigned to change the law and “upskirting” was made a criminal offence in 2019. “People say that upskirting was the first thing I ever did,” Martin says. “But that’s not true. I took that incident so hard because three months previously the CPS dropped the case I had against Matthew Hardy. Being a victim of Matthew Hardy fed heavily into the reason I do this work.” Hardy stalked these three Northwich pupils periodically for a combined 25 years. Melanie escaped first, in 2016, when she married and changed her name and he wasn’t able to find her. With Bailey and Martin, he continued until 2021. “I feel like I missed my 20s because of it,” Bailey says. “I was constantly scared and paranoid. I ended up going on antidepressants. My anxiety was through the roof. I was too scared to go out. I thought that everywhere I went he would be watching.” Stalking was Hardy’s life’s work and there were three phases to his offending. First, he stalked girls he went to school with. Then, he stalked women in his surrounding area. Finally, he stalked women to whom he had no connection at all. Usually, they were vibrant young women, with thriving personal and professional lives. Often, they had large social media followings. Zoe Jade Hallam was in the third tranche of women caught up in Hardy’s net. It started in 2018. The first message was on Snapchat, she recalls. “He said: ‘Can I tell you a secret?’” It progressed to silent phone calls. When Hallam cried on these calls from stress and fear, he would message her afterwards, chiding her for “crying like a baby”. He would taunt her. “He’d say: ‘Guess who I managed to speak to. About 50 people. Even some of your family’s fellas. Bet you’re arsed now.’” Hardy pretended to be Hallam’s partner’s father online and initiated inappropriate conversations with teenage girls from a fake account. “My boyfriend’s dad was a doctor,” Hallam said. “It was really damaging to his professional reputation. And I felt to blame. It was me that drew Matthew Hardy to him.” This was a common sentiment among Hardy’s victims, who were sometimes blamed for his harassment. “He ruined so many relationships,” says Abby Furness, a 22-year-old dancer from Brighton. “Because people would associate me with drama. They thought I was causing it. It wasn’t me. But my name was on everything.” Hardy began stalking Furness in 2019. He impersonated her online and tried to initiate a sexual conversation with a colleague. He obtained intimate photos of Furness and sent them to her boss. Worst of all, he sabotaged her relationship with her boyfriend. “My boyfriend got a message from a fake Instagram account saying that they knew I’d been cheating on him,” Furness says. “It gave our relationship trust issues. We ended up breaking up a month later.” Hardy also harassed her family so badly that she remains blocked on social media by some of them. “I kept thinking it would stop,” Furness says. “But it kept getting worse and worse. He’d contacted more people. I’d lost more friends over it. More work.” Paranoid, Furness began to suspect the people in her life were responsible. “Could it be my closest friend?” she says. “My boyfriend?” She developed anxiety and depression. Hallam reported the harassment to Lincolnshire police in April 2019. She was petrified and at breaking point. She slept with a samurai sword by her bed, because she lived alone and thought whoever was harassing her would break in. She gave the police Hardy’s phone number, but they said they couldn’t trace it. “They said they only do that in high-profile cases, like a rape or a murder,” says Hallam. “I said: ‘So we have to wait for that to happen before you do anything?’” Her experience is not unusual, says Alvarez. “Online stalking behaviours are usually not addressed as seriously by police and prosecutors,” she says. “Police officers often tell victims to simply block their stalker, or come offline. This advice is not appropriate, nor does it stop the stalker.” In desperation, one of Hallam’s family members hired a private investigator, who identified Hardy as her stalker in July 2019. She supplied his name to Lincolnshire police, who told her that an officer would visit Hardy and tell him to stop. “He lasted two months before he did it again,” says Hallam. In July 2020, Furness was packing for a holiday to Ibiza. Hardy messaged. “You need to be very careful,” he said. “Beware.” Terrified, Furness called Kent police. “They said: ‘Do you really think you are in danger? Because we’re 20 minutes away from you and something might happen over here.’ I said: ‘OK, I guess it’s fine then.’ I felt really silly.’” While she was in Ibiza, Furness was on Instagram Live when an account by the name of Matthew Hardy started asking her questions. Afterwards, Hardy messaged her on Facebook and confessed that he had been the person stalking her. When she checked the messages again later, Hardy had deleted his Facebook account. She felt as though there was no point getting back in touch with Kent police. “When I phoned them, they made me feel like I was wasting police time,” she says. “[They thought] I was this blond, naive girl who had loads of followers on Instagram, posted where she was all the time and wanted attention.” Even after his confession, Hardy continued to stalk Furness until September 2021. “Nearly every day, I’d get a message from someone I hadn’t spoken to in years saying: ‘Abby, I got your WhatsApp message, has your account been hacked?’” she says. The women’s ordeal may have continued were it not for PC Kevin Anderson, a 22-year veteran of Cheshire constabulary. In December 2019, Anderson was assigned to a stalking case involving Hardy. Digging around in Cheshire constabulary’s internal systems, he found something shocking. There were more than 100 logs on the system about Hardy, from 62 victims. (Some of these logs may have been duplicate reports of the same incident.) Hardy had been arrested 10 times and voluntarily interviewed a further three times. One detail stood out: Hardy had almost ruined a marriage, by telling a woman that her fiance was cheating on her – on her wedding day. “I thought: this guy needs to be brought to book,” says Anderson. The reports, which went back to 2011, made for uncomfortable reading for the police. “I can’t speak for the officers that were speaking to the victims at that time … people maybe didn’t understand what was happening to the victims, or understand the legislation,” Anderson says. He contacted officers with active cases on Hardy and arranged for them to be transferred to him. One case concerned a 23-year-old boutique owner, Lia Marie Hambly, from Maidstone, Kent. Hardy began stalking her in 2019. He contacted Hambly or her family and friends hundreds of times. “He would say that he hates me, that I’m a bitch,” she says. “Or he’d pretend to be me and talk to them.” He would call 10 times an hour, from unknown numbers, in the middle of the night. She went to Kent police in November 2019. “They’d only ever email me and say: ‘Don’t worry, we’re looking into it,’” says Hambly. She made a complaint about their handling of the case. In February 2020, Anderson phoned Hambly and told her that he was taking on her case. “The relief that someone cared,” she says. “Someone wanted to do something about it. He said: ‘We’ll get there. I’m here to listen and help you.’ That was all I wanted to hear.” “What struck me with Lia’s case was the way she handled herself,” says Anderson. Hambly, a former paralegal, had used her expertise to compile a dossier of every contact she had had with Hardy. “Hardy had told me that screenshotting his messages was pointless,” she says. “Talking to the police was pointless. He said I’d never find out who he was, or what he knew.” But she felt differently. Her indexed dossier was a staggering 700 pages long and numbered by Hardy’s social media accounts. By now, the Hardy case had taken over Anderson’s life. He would lie awake at night, asking himself if he had read a report correctly, or obtained all the phone numbers Hardy was using. “I had to make sure that I got a conviction for these people,” he says. “They’d put their faith and trust in me.” Anderson had five victims on indictment and a further four on schedule, meaning that the judge would take the additional cases into consideration when sentencing Hardy, if he were found guilty of the charges on the indictment. “I had to take a pragmatic approach,” he says. “With so many victims, it was difficult to portray what was happening. It could dilute the case if there were too many. So the strongest things were what we had on the indictment.” Nonetheless, he contacted other victims to ask if they would like to support the case by providing evidence for the court to consider. In all, Anderson collated more than 100 incidents from 62 victims, which he used to show Hardy’s bad character in court. When Hardy was arrested in February 2020, he denied everything. Even after he was charged in March 2021, he carried on stalking. Martin’s grandmother died of Covid in 2020. The following year, she received a message from a profile pretending to be her dead grandmother. “It said: ‘Hello, Gina,’” she remembers. “I was crying. I knew it was him.” Hardy even found time to acquire new victims. He began stalking Jill, 42, a probation officer from Manchester, in June 2021. Hardy impersonated a young female relative of Jill online and attempted to initiate a sexual relationship with Jill’s husband. Jill contacted Greater Manchester police, but she says they did nothing to help her. The stalking left her so paranoid that she slept with a baseball bat in one hand and a phone in the other. Eventually, one of Jill’s relatives put the phone number that had been harassing her into a prank-caller website. The number had been looked up 349 times and six users had left comments. “Messaged family members trying to ruin relationships/start incestuous relationships,” one user wrote. “His name is Matthew Hardy and he has done this for years.” Jill spoke with Cheshire constabulary, who used her case as supporting evidence. In October 2021, Hardy pleaded guilty to stalking involving fear of violence and harassment at Chester crown court. In January 2022, he was sentenced to nine years in jail, which is believed to be the longest sentence handed out in a British court for a stalking offence. Anderson thinks it was necessary. “He would never have stopped,” he says. “Even on bail, he was still doing it.” Hambly was in court that day. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. “I thought he would only get a few months.” At home, Hallam got the news from a friend. “I was so emotional,” she says. Her voice breaks and she chokes back sobs. “I thought I would have to live with this for ever.” Hardy’s crimes have cast a long shadow. His victims are triggered by unknown numbers – which meant contacting survivors for this piece was challenging. When we spoke, many expressed fears that I was a stalker pretending to be a journalist. Hardy has completely shattered their sense of safety. “All I do now is worry,” says Furness. “It doesn’t leave you. It’s like a cut that keeps getting deeper and deeper over the years. It never heals.” In mitigation, Hardy’s defence barrister, Sara Haque, said that Hardy was autistic and had learning difficulties and mental health problems. “The defendant wishes to have a full, happy life,” she told the court. “He sees these people living their happy lives online and tries to make a connection with them … there is then a rejection that the defendant feels, which then triggers a lashing out.” Melanie believes his offending is connected to his school days. “He was always ignored by women,” says Melanie. “He never had a girlfriend. He never hung out with girls. I’m not a psychologist. But it seems to me that he was trying to get back at the girls who rejected him.” Alvarez says that cases like Hardy’s are mercifully unusual. “It’s rare for us to see a case where the perpetrator has multiple concurrent victims,” she says. “However, this does happen with particular typologies of stalker, such as an ‘incompetent suitor’, or intimacy-seeking stalker.” Such stalkers are typically motivated by loneliness and unknown to their victims, or have met them only briefly. All the victims are grateful to Anderson for working tirelessly to secure Hardy’s conviction. “Kev was amazing,” says Hambly. “I cannot fault him.” Despite finally being the officer to end Hardy’s campaign of terror, Anderson wishes he could have done more. “I still have a pang of guilt about not being able to bring the other victim accounts to court via a charge,” he says. But there is anger at how long it took to stop Hardy’s stalking and harassment. Martin says: “What worries me is that it’s not a sustainable solution – to hope that these cases happen to pass across the desk of a police officer who makes it their job to convict this guy. That is not how we are supposed to get justice.” Unfortunately, this is too often the case. Across England and Wales, police consistently fail to bring charges against stalkers. “Only 11% of reports of stalking result in a charge,” says Alvarez. Even when the stalker is charged, conviction rates are abysmal. “Just 0.1% of cases result in a conviction,” says Alvarez. This is despite the fact that many stalkers go on to commit further crimes. The criminologist Dr Jane Monckton-Smith places stalking at stage five of her eight-stage homicide timeline. A 2017 study of 358 femicides from the University of Gloucestershire found that stalking took place in nine of the 10 murders surveyed. “It’s therefore incredibly important for the safety of the victim that this risk is recognised as early as possible by police officers when they respond to a call,” says Alvarez. “Sadly, victims state that often police don’t believe them, or refuse to put the right protections in place.” Cyberstalking is on the rise. Calls to the National Stalking Helpline about it have increased 20% since the start of the pandemic. Stalkers are taking advantage of our increasingly digitised lives to target victims through spyware, drones and even smart kettles and CCTV. Alvarez is particularly concerned by the rise in stalking using Apple AirTags as tracking devices. To address this, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust has called for the creation of a national taskforce to examine low conviction rates, as well as multi-agency stalking intervention programmes to identify and monitor high-risk stalkers. For now, Hardy won’t be able to ruin his victims’ lives. But the chaos he wreaked may take a lifetime to unpick. “I used to say to my friends that this would be a good book one day,” says Melanie. “Because none of it makes sense. But it’s also like: why did we all have to suffer for so long? Why did it take so long to put him away?”",News/Society,"11 years, 10 arrests, at least 62 women: how did Britain’s worst cyberstalker evade justice for so long?",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/30/11-years-10-arrests-at-least-62-women-how-did-britains-worst-cyberstalker-evade-justice-for-so-long
3/30/2022,"Labour is calling for “a post 9/11” style increase in defence spending in response to the Ukraine crisis following forecasts that the budget could fall by up to 3% a year this parliament despite the outbreak of a war in Europe. The party declined to put a firm figure on the commitment sought, but, in the decade after 9/11, defence spending increased by more than £10bn a year in real terms, partly to pay for costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. John Healey, the party’s defence spokesperson, said Downing Street needed to urgently overhaul last year’s Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy, which had set out plans for an “Indo-Pacific tilt” to contain China. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demonstrated, Healey said, that significant threats lay much closer to home and that the UK needed to “honour our Nato obligations in Europe”, and reverse a 9,500 cut in the size of the British army by 2025. “‘Global Britain’ was the prime minister’s vanity plan, not a national strategy for Britain to be a force for good in the world. It took security and prosperity in Europe for granted,” Healey said. “Ministers must respond to new threats to UK and European security, just as Labour in government did after the 9/11 terror attacks with the largest sustained increase in defence spending for two decades,” the shadow defence secretary added. The government’s Integrated Review, published last March, did not forecast either “a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan or invasion of Ukraine”, Labour added. Instead, it proposed to cut tanks by a third and scrap the Hercules transport aircraft as well as cut the size of the army to its lowest level since 1714. Under Keir Starmer’s leadership, Labour has been increasingly keen to present itself as a party focused on Britain’s national security – with Healey telling the Guardian that Labour would support any future increases in defence spending if they were proposed by the Conservative government. Britain is expecting to spend £31.6bn on day to day defence spending in between 2021 and 2022, and a further £14.6bn on capital. But despite government promises of a four-year spending boost last year, rising inflation means spending is set to fall in real terms. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent thinktank, estimates that the day-to-day defence budget could fall by 3% a year in real terms for the rest of the parliament using the CPI measure of inflation and by 1.9% a year with capital investment included. Healey accused ministers of presiding over inaction while the war in Ukraine continued, after no significant change was announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak last week. Several other Nato countries, led by Germany, have pledged to lift their defence spending since the war began. “Putin isn’t operating to the Treasury’s timetable or the MoD’s five-yearly defence reviews. Russia is waging a war in Europe, so Britain can’t carry on with business as before,” the Labour MP said. Britain has agreed to double the 900 troops it bases in Estonia and send a further 450 to Poland since the crisis began, but eastern European members of Nato, nervous of Russian intentions, want the alliance go further in the coming months. Additional deployments will be agreed at the next summit of the military alliance in Madrid in June.",News/UK news,Labour calls for increase in defence spending,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/labour-calls-for-increase-defence-spending-response-to-ukraine-war
3/30/2022,"Public satisfaction with the NHS has sunk to its lowest level since 1997, with just 36% of voters content with the way the health service is run and performing. More people in England, Scotland and Wales are now dissatisfied (41%) with the NHS than are satisfied for the first time since 2002, according to research from the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen). Discontent then led to Tony Blair’s Labour government raising taxes to improve the service and introducing targets to ensure speedy care. Satisfaction has dropped 17% since 2020 – the biggest drop since records began in 1983. The collapse has been driven by frustration over long waiting times for all main types of NHS care, the service’s persistent staff shortages and a widespread belief that the government has denied it the funding it needs. NatCen’s British Social Attitudes survey found the lowest levels of satisfaction with GPs (38%), dentists (33%), A&E (39%) and both hospital inpatient (41%) and outpatient (49%) services since it began tracking public attitudes. The shift has occurred among people of all ages, income groups, sexes and party political affiliations. The King’s Fund and Nuffield Trust thinktanks, which published the findings, said they were unprecedented and represented “the most extraordinary set of results we have seen”. The Covid pandemic and the ensuing disruption to NHS services have deepened the fall in satisfaction but unhappiness – especially with access to GP appointments and routine surgery – was evident well before then. The NHS has seen a decade-long funding squeeze and a failure to address the chronic lack of staff, the thinktanks added. “People are often struggling to get the care they need, and identified access to general practice, waiting times for hospital care and staff shortages as areas that need to improve,” said Dan Wellings, a senior fellow at the King’s Fund. While the pandemic’s arrival in 2020 initially created “a halo effect” around the NHS, this gave way last year to more negative public attitudes when people “were seeing other services opening up [and] thinking ‘well, why isn’t the NHS opening up?’” he added. About four in 10 people in England are now either on the 6.1 million-strong waiting list for planned NHS care or have a family member who is. “That’s the story behind the frustration – people deteriorating and in pain, people visiting their GP because they can’t get into hospital because of the waiting lists,” Wellings said. In better news for the NHS, the representative survey of 3,112 Britons undertaken in September and October found strong enduring support across voting lines for its founding principles: that it is funded by general taxation and available free of charge. The public also remain happy with the quality of care they receive and with the attitude and behaviour of staff they encounter when being treated. “People can be very supportive of the NHS and be dissatisfied simultaneously,” said Prof John Appleby, the Nuffield Trust’s director of research and chief economist. Wellings declined to draw parallels with high public dissatisfaction now and the discontent that was a key issue in the 1997 general election, and which contributed to the defeat suffered by Conservative prime minister John Major. But the dissatisfaction could coalesce into a political problem for Boris Johnson, he added. “It’s a very worrying set of findings for the government, given the place of the NHS in the British public’s mind and fact that it’s one of the key issues that people vote on at election time.” The Department of Health and Social Care did not comment directly on the findings. A spokesperson said: “The pandemic has placed enormous pressure on the NHS, which is why we are focused on recovering from the impact of Covid and delivering reform. We have set out our plan to tackle the Covid-19 backlog, backed by our record multibillion-pound investment over the next three years. “We have seen record numbers of staff working for the NHS this year, with over 4,300 more doctors and over 11,700 more nurses compared to last year, and we recently commissioned the NHS to develop a long-term workforce strategy.” Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said he was “extremely disappointed and saddened” at the record low satisfaction with GP services. He highlighted family doctors’ key role in the Covid vaccine rollout and pointed to the major problems besetting the GP workforce as the key reason some patients struggle to get an appointment.",News/Society,Public satisfaction with NHS sinks to lowest level since 1997,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/30/public-satisfaction-with-nhs-sinks-to-lowest-level-since-1997
3/30/2022,"Senior Labor ministers have claimed Tuesday’s budget contains $3bn of “secret cuts”. Under close examination, this is mostly due to measures moved from “decisions taken but not announced” into other parts of the budget. In December, the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) update contained $16bn of decisions taken but not announced and other “mystery” spending, which Labor claimed was a secret election war chest. An explanation can be found on page 49 of budget paper 2 of Tuesday’s budget. It shows that the government updated that a further $1.4bn in decisions taken but not announced, or confidential spending, would take place in 2022-23. But in the remaining three years from 2023-24 to 2025-26, there appears to be a $3bn reduction in this line item. In at least four interviews on Wednesday, Anthony Albanese raised the spectre of “$3bn of hidden cuts”. The shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, claimed these were “secret cuts … coming after the election if you re-elect Scott Morrison”. REVEALED: $3 billion in secret cuts are coming after the election if you re-elect Scott Morrison.And they won’t tell you what they are going to cut either.#auspol #Budget22 pic.twitter.com/Zjxt8xwskl The shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, asked “what roads, rail, services and jobs” the Coalition plans to cut: $3b of cuts hiding in decisions taken but not announced.They promise one thing before the election, but deliver nothing but cuts after.What roads, rail, services and jobs does Scott Morrison plan to cut? pic.twitter.com/egqC29rYdX On Wednesday the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, responded that Labor “can’t even read the budget papers correctly” or was being “completely misleading”. “What they’re peddling around is a reduction in a budget line of decisions taken but not yet announced,” he told Sky News. “That’s because those were things that we budgeted for back in the [Myefo] that were decisions which we have subsequently announced.” Birmingham gave the example of the $1.3bn women’s safety package, which had money set aside in Myefo that was then allocated in the budget. “So we’ve provisioned for it in the responsible way – to do it now shifts from that budget line to the other one.” In question time, Labor asked about the “$3bn cuts”. Scott Morrison explained “when that number goes into the negative, other numbers go into the positive”. “It comes out of that column and it goes into another column.” The use of “cuts” is misleading, and implies that the $3bn represents previously announced programs that will be axed or slashed – when, in fact, they are still government policy and funded in the budget. Budget paper no 2 is littered with programs in this category, identified by the words “partial funding for this measure has already been provided for by the government”. These include: The $3.7bn skills package. $1bn investment in university research commercialisation. $468.3m for aged care. $423.7m for fighting cancer. $131.5m for the Medicare Benefits Schedule. $228.5m for school education support. $230.7m for strengthening primary health care. Infrastructure investment. Support for forestry and fishing, and the Great Barrier Reef. Australian export and trade support. The mental health package. Countering violent extremism and transnational crime. Advancing science, technology, engineering and maths. Energy and emissions reduction. Support for the space industry. Community development grants. This is not a list of programs that are being cut – it is a list of programs the government has committed to implement, that have already been partially funded in Myefo. The $3bn line item is, at least in part, a function of funding for these programs moving from “decisions taken but not announced” into the rest of the budget. Could the $3bn line item contain future cuts in 2023-34, 2024-25, 2025-26? Possibly. Is it all cuts? No – it represents spending that will occur, shifted from one part of the budget to the other. For the avoidance of doubt, the government should release the breakdown of the $3bn, before the misrepresentation of “$3bn of cuts” travels around the world and back.",News/Australia news,Factcheck: Does the federal 2022-23 budget contain $3bn of secret cuts?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/factcheck-does-the-federal-2022-23-budget-contain-3bn-of-secret-cuts
