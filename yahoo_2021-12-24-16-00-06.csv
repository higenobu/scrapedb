12/24/2021,"A retired NYPD officer has accused her former commanding officer of raping her in a new lawsuit. The NYPD told Insider on Wednesday that the incident is ""under internal review."" Calls made to numbers associated with the captain named in the lawsuit were not answered Wednesday. A retired New York City police officer accused her former commanding officer of serially raping her for more than a year while they worked together on the Yankee Stadium beat, according to a lawsuit filed in Bronx Supreme Court on Monday. In the lawsuit viewed by Insider, Gillian Roberts, who identifies as African-American, said she hoped to stay on the Yankee Stadium detail until her retirement, but decided to leave the department early last month when she could no longer handle the stress of becoming an ""unwilling sex slave"" to her ""perverted"" captain, Jeffrey Brienza. When reached for comment about Roberts' lawsuit on Wednesday, an NYPD spokesman said the ""incident is under internal review."" Insider also called several numbers associated with Brienza on Wednesday, but didn't get an answer. Roberts' attorney, Fred Lichtmacher, told Insider in an interview on Thursday that he expects more women to come forward soon. He added that a ""sexist"" culture exists at the NYPD, which left his client with no choice but to leave the department. ""The NYPD has a policy, not stated but very much in effect, where they protect their royalty,"" Lichtmacher said. ""They circle their wagons where there is a complaint about a supervisor. You're knocked down if you come out and say something about a supervisor. Gillian knew this and knew she had to leave."" According to the lawsuit, Roberts joined the NYPD in 1998, and in March 2020, secured a transfer to the Yankee Stadium Detail, which is considered an ""elite"" position within the department. Soon after joining the detail, she said her commanding officer, Brienza, started giving her preferential treatment — making comments to gain her trust and isolating her from the rest of the unit by making her his personal driver. A few months into the new job, in June 2020, Roberts said she was using the bathroom at the end of her shift when Brienza followed her into the room and grabbed her from behind ""very forcefully and tightly."" ""Ms. Roberts yelled, 'No!' and tried peeling her attacker's hands off of her, to which Captain Brienza responded by saying, 'Yes' as he forcefully turned her around,"" the lawsuit states. ""Captain Brienza placed his hands around Ms. Roberts' neck and forced her head down towards his waistline, where his penis was already out of his pants and erect, and forced Ms. Roberts to perform oral sex without protection."" Brienza then placed Roberts ""against the counter and raped her vaginally with no protection,"" according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit states Brienza began regularly calling Roberts into his office where he would ""shove her head down, forcing her to perform unprotected oral sex."" ""This occurred nearly every game day for a year, and most non-game days when they were on duty at the same time when he would arrange for them to be alone,"" the lawsuit says. She says he would also frequently make her drive him a certain route home, and pull over along the way to make her perform oral sex on him. If Roberts tried to avoid Brienza, she said he would assign her to undesirable posts and make comments about how she ""stood him up."" According to the lawsuit, Roberts ""felt as though her career and well being were on the line if she did not comply with the Captain's repeated assaults of her."" ""Because of his high rank, Captain Brienza worked frequently on internal instances of complaints, and went out of his way to remind Ms. Roberts that he 'knows how these things end,'"" the lawsuit states. ""On more than one occasion, Captain Brienza threatened Ms Roberts' job by telling her that is she were to say anything about what he was doing to her, 'she would be the one to get in trouble,'"" the lawsuit alleges. Roberts said she finally had enough after Brienza raped her in the women's locker room after a Yankees game in September 2021. After that incident, Roberts ""felt like she could no longer endure what was happening to her"" and ""feared that if she did not reach out to someone for help, her life could be on the line."" So she reported the alleged sexual misconduct to an inspector in the Internal Affairs Bureau. While Roberts had originally hoped to stay with the department, and on the stadium unit, until at least 2023, which would have marked 25 years with the NYPD, she ""felt that she had no choice other than to retire from the NYPD"" early, on November 30. Roberts' lawyer writes in the lawsuit that before working on the Stadium detail, putting on her NYPD uniform was the ""best moment"" of Roberts' day, because she ""was proud that as an officer she was able to help a lot of people."" ""That role, those feelings, and the love of her job were all taken away from her due to what the Captain did,"" the lawsuit says. Roberts asks for $35 million in compensatory damages in the lawsuit. Roberts' attorney told Insider on Thursday that he has two goals with the lawsuit: help make his client well again and make sure Brienza is never ""able to do this anymore."" He also hopes it will create change within the NYPD. ""The NYPD has got to get into the 20th century. It's still a sexist organization, a racist organization. It's not a coincidence that this is an African-American that this happened to, at the hands of a white supervisor,"" Lichtmacher said. ""Who could feel less powerful than a Black woman being raped by her white supervisor in the NYPD?""

12/24/2021,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly spent 18 months sparring with Kansas’ legislative Republicans over COVID-19 measures. In the early days of the pandemic she imposed and then extended a stay-at-home order, issued a brief statewide mask mandate and tried to limit in-person worship services – all while meeting growls of GOP protest. Then in November, two days after Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe to become governor of reliably blue Virginia, Kelly expressed her first opposition to Democratic President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates. A couple weeks later, she signed a bill aimed at helping Kansas workers resist vaccine mandates, a proposal that even the GOP-friendly Kansas Chamber of Commerce opposed. As Democrats shook their heads, Kelly’s moves signaled her efforts to appeal to moderate Republican and GOP-leaning independent voters who she will need to win a tough reelection race in a heavily Republican state next year. Like Democratic governors in Michigan and Wisconsin, Kelly will try to win a second term against midterm political headwinds blowing in Republicans’ favor. But she’s trying it in a state former President Donald Trump carried twice and where Republicans, energized in opposition to Biden’s vaccine mandates, look likely to avoid a serious primary fight. Her attempt to stake out ground in the political center has irritated some fellow Democrats in the short term. But others argue the tactic could work for her if she also hammers home a message that Kansas now has a stable budget and its public schools are considered fully funded. ""What Democrats need to remember is that she’s doing that to try to win reelection,"" said Mike Swenson, who has worked as a Democratic strategist and consultant in the Kansas City area for over four decades. He added: “We can appeal to the moderates — absolutely.” Kelly said throughout the pandemic that she would follow science in addressing it. But Republican lawmakers used their legislative supermajorities to force her to accept more local control over decisions about requiring masks and restricting businesses — a move that allowed many communities to reject recommendations from public health officials. She weathered their criticism for making prison inmates an early priority for vaccines. And so she surprised some Democrats and liberal activists by publicly questioning Biden's vaccine mandates and quickly signing Republicans' bill.  The new law provides unemployment benefits if workers lose jobs for refusing shots and allows them to claim religious exemptions, no questions asked. Also, to some Democrats, she seemed closer to Republican leaders: Multiple Democratic lawmakers said they learned of her plans to sign the bill from GOP colleagues' gloating texts. “It’s a huge, huge gamble,” said Christopher Reeves, a Kansas City-area consultant and former Democratic National Committee member. She signed the measure less than a week after the state health department's head abruptly resigned. Dr. Lee Norman was visible early in the coronavirus pandemic, appearing with Kelly at news conferences, often wearing a white lab coat. Internal emails showed an internal conflict this past summer over pandemic messaging, and Norman also recently said  Kelly's administration ousted him because of COVID-19 politics. Kelly positioning herself in the political center on vaccines contrasts with her strong support for abortion access and LGBTQ rights.  Kelly said during a recent Associated Press interview that her decision-making isn't driven by “what voters it’s going to keep in my camp.” She cited major bipartisan legislation on school funding and transportation funding as examples of her approach. “It’s the only way to govern and govern well,” she said. Even as Kelly and GOP lawmakers sparred early in the pandemic, she praised Trump's response to outbreaks in meatpacking plants enough that he later said she was doing a “fantastic job” in handling the pandemic. Environmental issues provide another example of appealing to Republican-minded voters. Her administration resisted Biden administration efforts to preserve the lesser prairie chicken’s habitat, which raises concerns that agriculture and energy production will be restricted. Kelly’s administration has also been skeptical of Biden’s push to preserve 30% of the nation’s land by 2030, which critics call a land grab. In addition, after forming a racial justice commission after the Minnesota killing of George Floyd last year, she didn't intervene this year when its proposals stalled in the Legislature.  And on Wednesday, Kelly proposed giving a one-time $250 rebate to every Kansas resident who filed a state income tax return last year, with $500 going to married couples who file jointly. The move came after Kelly vetoed three GOP proposals for permanent income tax cuts in three years, calling those measures fiscally irresponsible. “It’s just the reality of being a Democratic governor in Kansas,” said Bob Beatty, a Washburn University of Topeka political scientist. “You have to be in the middle and sometimes you have to be in the middle-right.” While Democrats haven't won a U.S. Senate race in Kansas in nearly 90 years, they've been successful in trading the governor's office back and forth with Republicans over the past half-century. Swenson said the formula is “simple”: Run up votes in the state's 10 most populous counties and avoid losing the other 95 by too much. Kelly essentially followed that path to victory in 2018. It also helped Kelly in 2018 that her GOP foe was polarizing conservative Trump ally Kris Kobach, whose take-no-prisoners style alienated moderate voters. Kelly's expected Republican opponent next year is Derek Schmidt, the state's three-term attorney general. Schmidt is running as an anti-abortion, small-government attorney general, but in the mold of Kansas Republicans like former U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts and the late Bob Dole — pragmatic enough to avoid alienating moderates. Kelly prepared for 2022 by hiring a reelection campaign manager who in 2020 led Democrats' successful effort to flip a Republican congressional seat in Georgia. Shelbi Dantic was also the deputy campaign manager in Montana for U.S. Sen. Jon Tester when he was narrowly  reelected in 2018. ___ Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna",Politics/Associated Press,Kansas governor breaks with Biden in appeal to GOP voters,https://news.yahoo.com/kansas-governors-break-biden-latest-151547635.html
