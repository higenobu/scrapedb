1/7/2022,"Kieran Trippier has completed his move from Atlético Madrid to Newcastle United, who are confident the England right-back will prove the first of several statement signings made by the Saudi Arabian-led regime at St James’ Park. Trippier flew to Newcastle on a private jet from Spain on Tuesday and passed a medical before completing a deal Newcastle claim is worth an initial £12m, rising to £15m with assorted add-ons but which Atlético have suggested is closer to the £25m mark.  Whatever the 31-year-old’s cost, Trippier’s reunion with Eddie Howe, the manager who signed him for Burnley, has come in time for his installation in the team’s defence for the vital Premier League home game against relegation rivals Watford on Saturday week. He may though make his debut during Saturday’s third-round FA Cup tie against League One Cambridge United at St James’ Park. He has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal. Trippier said: “I’m delighted to be joining this fantastic club. I really enjoyed my time in Madrid, but when I became aware of interest from Newcastle United, and having worked with Eddie Howe before, I knew this was where I wanted to be. “I’m aware there is a lot of work ahead of us but I know the demands of Premier League well and I know what an amazing club this is with very talented players. I can’t wait to get started and I’m excited to step out at St. James’ Park as a Newcastle player.” By the time of Watford’s visit Howe, whose side have won once all season and remain in the bottom three, will hope to have recruited a centre-half as well as a centre-forward to replace the injured Callum Wilson, whose torn calf muscle could sideline him for a couple of months. Although Newcastle have made a bid for Lille’s defender Sven Botman, the Ligue 1 club rejected it and, reluctant to sell, are believed to be holding out for more than £30m for the 21-year-old. It may be somewhat easier for Newcastle to secure Aaron Ramsey’s transfer from Juventus but although the Wales midfielder seems open to such a move and is very much on the way out in Turin, defence and attack appear more urgent priorities on Tyneside, where Trippier will earn more than £100,000 a week Howe covets a central midfielder and the idea of Ramsey arriving on loan does not seem entirely out of the question. On Wednesday the Juventus manager, Massimiliano Allegri, described Ramsey as an “outgoing player”. Newcastle have an interest in the Everton left-back Lucas Digne, who has fallen out with Rafael Benítez, but it is believed Digne is not enamoured of the idea of relocating to a club in a relegation skirmish. Howe, reflecting on the signing of Trippier, said: “A lot of hard work has gone into planning for the January transfer window long before the month began, which is clear in how quickly we have been able to complete this move.” Meanwhile Amanda Staveley and her fellow directors continue to talk to Brighton’s Dan Ashworth about a potential switch to the north-east, where he would work alongside Howe as director of football.",Sport/Football,‘I can’t wait’: Kieran Trippier seals Newcastle move from Atlético Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/kieran-trippier-signs-newcastle-move-from-atletico-madrid
1/7/2022,"I’m not against my sister going out and having fun, but she’s also got to respect my boundaries  Before Mariana, my older sister, moved in last summer, I had my own space and routine in this flat. I was nervous because she’s such an extrovert and I knew our lifestyles were different. Mariana loves going out, meeting new people and having parties, whereas I’m really not into any of that. We established rules right away, one of which was that we couldn’t have strangers here. I knew that when my sister lived at university she had parties that got out of control, so I said: “Only friends and friends of friends, no strangers.” She didn’t like it, and said whatever she does in her room should be her business, but I argued that it’s a shared space and I want to feel safe. Mariana is a lot more free than me, sexually and socially, but I told her she needed to compromise and eventually she agreed. The first night I left her alone, Mariana had a huge party with a band she met at a club. There were loads of people in our flat when I got back, and the floor was sticky. The morning after, Mariana was apologetic, saying things just got out of hand; she seemed so sorry I let it go. But then about two months later she brought a random guy back for the night. She had called at 2am that night to warn me and told me he was a friend of a friend who had lost his keys. She said he’d be stranded if we didn’t let him crash so I’d agreed. But when I started chatting to them, it quickly became clear the story didn’t add up. I was stewing all the next morning; then Mariana confessed she’d made up the story because she’d wanted him to stay over. We got into a huge fight. Mariana thought I’d overreacted but she broke my trust over a random guy, so what did she expect? Since then, Mariana hasn’t brought anyone back (that I know of). I’m not against her dating casually, but she needs to respect my boundaries. I also think it’s better if she gets to know someone before bringing them home. This rule isn’t about controlling her; it’s about protecting her and our shared space – why can’t she see that? I’ve had a few fights with my younger sister about my love life – I’m offended she doesn’t trust me My sister is particular about having boys in the flat. She’s younger than me, still at university, and has less experience with relationships. But I’m in my mid-20s, and the rule makes a big difference to my life. Before living with Mafalda, I lived with a friend and we did what we wanted. I’m sexually comfortable and used to bringing people to my space. After my sister and I agreed on the rule, I was still really defensive. I said it was my room and my space. When I had the party that first time, Mafalda wasn’t even there for most of the night. There wasn’t much to apologise for as I cleaned up the mess. I had planned on inviting just a few people but loads turned up at the door. I knew most of them though. We’ve had quite a few fights about my love life. Mafalda said if I had been dating someone for a while, she would be OK with it, but if it was the first or second date, she wouldn’t want them around. She would feel uncomfortable. I was offended that she doesn’t trust my judgment. Does she think I go for terrible, dangerous guys? She once said I shouldn’t be having casual sex, which annoyed me – it’s not her business. I tried to explain that I would never bring someone back who would put me in a dangerous situation, much less her. That one time I brought a guy back and lied to her was stupid. Mafalda bought into it for a while but we were clearly drunk and lying. Afterwards, she and I had a huge fight and she didn’t talk to me for days. I tried to apologise but she got really angry. Mafalda kept reiterating that I had no consideration for her wellbeing. She blew it out of proportion, especially when I’m the one cleaning the house and cooking dinners – she forgot about all that. After a few days we had a long conversation. Now, ideally, if I want to bring a guy home I’ll prepare Mafalda and make sure she’s heard of him before so it’s not a surprise. But there may be times when this doesn’t work or she doesn’t approve, and I can’t stop living my life to suit her. Should Mariana stop bringing strangers back to the flat? Mariana is guilty of reneging on the agreement she made with Mafalda. If Mariana feels the terms are proving too restrictive, she should either attempt to reach a new compromise or look for somewhere else to live.Julia, 67 Mariana should be allowed to bring randoms back to her room and, when her sister’s out, be allowed parties if she cleans up afterwards. Mafalda should realise that it’s safer for Mariana to bring random men back to her place than going to theirs.Poppy, 38 Mariana appears to have been forced into accepting a rule which doesn’t suit her needs. The time when she lied about the guy’s keys is a natural reaction – we break the rules we don’t agree with and didn’t make.Alex, 35 Of course Mariana wants to have fun in her twenties, but not bringing strangers back to the flat is a small compromise to make. She is also being naive if she thinks she can identify a “dangerous guy” on a first meeting.Miranda, 22 For all the talk of compromise, the rule is Mafalda’s, and Mariana’s “rule breaking” since makes clear this was no negotiation and no agreed truce. Perhaps the seeds of a true compromise lie in Mariana’s final statement – fair warning as often as possible, and trust where not.Richard, 39 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Mariana stop bringing strangers back to the flat?

1/7/2022,"During five years of breastfeeding, I have fed my babies on buses, trains and park benches, in cinemas, cafes and restaurants. I have a vivid memory of feeding my son, perched like an Elizabethan lady riding sidesaddle, on a fallen log in Richmond Park in London while my dad stood beside me, his eyes respectfully skyward, as I felt all the feelings known to humankind. A few years later, I breastfed my one-month-old daughter on stage at a book festival in Scotland while discussing Anne of Green Gables, which was like some divine coalescence of all my favourite things. Afterwards, the audience, mostly made up of women of a certain age, lined up to congratulate me and shake the newborn’s tiny hand. They would never have been able to do such a thing in their day, they said. What progress we have made. I look back on all this now and feel lucky that no one took a photo of my breasts mid-feed. At least not as far as I know. This is a strong indicator of how low the bar remains for us undervalued and oversexualised mothers: that one is genuinely pleased not to have been sexually harassed while feeding one’s baby. Had someone taken out an SLR camera, attached a telephoto lens, taken closeup photos, and, when approached, refused to delete them on the grounds that it’s a public place and therefore his right, I wouldn’t have been able to do a thing about it.  This is exactly what happened to Julia Cooper when she breastfed her baby in a Manchester park. She reported the incident to the police and was told no crime had been committed. The Voyeurism Act, passed in 2019, banned the taking of non-consensual photographs of genitals or buttocks (upskirting) but did not cover photographs of the upper body. Which itself tells a short, grim story about how the law, and the world it enshrines, delineates women’s bodies. Bit by bit. First buttocks, then breasts. Thanks to Cooper, who took the matter to her Labour MP, Jeff Smith, as well as Labour MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy, people who photograph or film women breastfeeding without consent now face being put on the sex offender register and jailed for up to two years. This is welcome and, like most incremental changes, bigger than it looks. In a more reasonable world you might even think the home secretary, Priti Patel, would thus be inclined, for the sake of consistency if nothing else, to take another look at, say, her nationality and borders bill, which will have a devastating impact on female survivors of violence. But this is not the world in which we live, nor the direction Tory U-turns tend to take. The proposed change to the law around breastfeeding in public follows a reform campaign led by Creasy and Smith to criminalise the behaviour under the slogan Stop The Breast Pest. Breast pest, unfortunately, is one of those catchphrases that the warped British brain can’t help but visualise as a mildly titillating tabloid headline. I don’t need a trivialising end-of-the-pier rhyme to give a damn about breastfeeding voyeurism. Can’t we just stop objectifying breasts instead? Creasy was also photographed while breastfeeding her baby, in her case by a “laughing” teenage boy on a train in north London. She spoke about the “horror” of it months before she was reprimanded for bringing her baby in a sling to a parliamentary debate. The two incidents together form a perfect microcosm of how mothers and their babies are treated in this country. Not welcome in the mother of parliaments. Not safe on a train. Or, for that matter, a plane. (Yes, KLM, I’m looking at you.) For those who haven’t experienced the joys and hardships of breastfeeding, it’s like riding a bike: really hard until it’s really easy. Mostly, the stage at which we do it out and about is when the baby is small, needs feeding at least every two hours (or is that two minutes?), and we’re still learning on the job. Going on a bus is an exploit of Everest-sized proportions. Nipple shields, creams and soul-destroying wrestles with muslins in an attempt at “discretion” might be involved, not to mention the baby in her infernal nest of buckles and straps. Then there’s the worst pain of all: the scorn of society, should your milk project on to the back of a stranger’s neck or, worse, your baby cry. The vulnerability factor is off the scale. For all this to coincide with the possibility of being stared at, laughed at, photographed and harassed, can be stressful to the point of off-putting. For some it means feeding in a toilet cubicle while trying not to bang your baby’s head on the loo roll holder. For others, it means not going out at all. The unending fetishisation of breasts, in whatever context they happen to be, is the mark of a misogynistic society that still hasn’t got to grips with the most basic facts of life. Babies need to be fed. And a woman’s breasts are, like the rest of her body, her own. Chitra Ramaswamy is a freelance journalist based in Edinburgh. She is the author of Expecting: The Inner Life of Pregnancy",Opinion/Opinion,Photographing breastfeeding mothers?

1/7/2022,"With towns and cities across the US increasingly deluged by ferocious storms and rising sea levels, a group of disaster survivors has pleaded with the federal government to overhaul a flood insurance system they say is ill-equipped for an era of climate crisis. A petition of nearly 300 people who have been flooded, and their advocates, is set to be sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to call for a drastic overhaul of the government-run flood insurance system that underwrites most flood policies in the US.  “We’ve lived without electricity, running water and secure shelter,” reads the petition, organized by Anthropocene Alliance, an environmental non-profit. “We’ve heard our children cry from the absence of friends, school and safety. And we’ve confronted homelessness, illness and mind-numbing red tape from insurance companies and government agencies.” The survivors are calling for a ban on “irresponsible” housing development in flood-prone areas, new rules that would provide buyers with the present and future flood risks of a property before purchasing it and a greater focus on relocating communities and elevating properties away from floodwater rather than simply funding rebuilding flooded homes in the same place as before. “To continue to build in vulnerable places does not make sense and needs to come to a halt,” said Stephen Eisenman, director of strategy at Anthropocene Alliance. “A lot of people are suckered into buying in these places because there’s no federal disclosure laws. This is turning into a crisis, especially for poorer people ... “We are beginning to see the start of a great American flood migration and that exodus is only going to accelerate in the next decade. To keep building in these areas is just crazy.” A particular controversy is a process called “fill and build” where developers heap soil upon flood prone areas, elevating them slightly before building housing upon the compacted dirt. Critics say this simply diverts floodwater to neighbors and is a short-term fix to a chronic problem. “We have developers building on wetland areas that can’t hold water anymore so it just flows off onto us,” said Amber Bismack, a petition signatory who lives in Livingston County, Michigan, which is a part of Detroit’s metropolitan area. Bismack moved to the area, close to a tributary of the Huron river, seven years ago and has seen her neighborhood flood on 15 occasions in this time. The flooding has become so bad at times that Bismack has had to don waders to carry her children home through floodwater. The family have had to temporarily move out of the house, too, when the drains stopped working because of the flooding. She said that the worsening floods are taking its toll on the local community. “I can’t tell you how much depression we are seeing in the community because it just floods over and over again, we’ve seen a real decline in people’s mental health,” said Bismack, who is part of a community group that is calling for Congress to mandate flood risk disclosure to all potential homebuyers. “I know someone who thought their flood insurance would be $1,000 a year but couldn’t find out the true risk until they bought and it was deemed by Fema to be high risk with a premium of $13,000 a year, which is unlivable,” she said. “People are just stuck.” The national flood insurance scheme was launched in 1968 and has become the default for millions of Americans unable to get mortgages without flood insurance, which is routinely denied by private providers. The system has been driven into debt, however, with some homes repeatedly rebuilt in the same place only to be flooded again. Fema deems homes at risk if they are in something called the 100-year flood plain, which means they have a 1% risk each year of getting a foot of water in flooding. This system does not account, however, for the proximity to water or the unfolding climate crisis, meaning that many of the flood maps are inaccurate and premiums do not reflect the actual risk. “Fema is a joke, it doesn’t update its flood maps,” said Jackie Jones, a resident of Reidsville, Georgia, a town that often floods following heavy rainfall. “I wouldn’t have bought this house if I knew I’d get so much water but based on Fema’s maps, there’s no flooding here. They need to step up and take some control.” In October, Fema unveiled a new system, called Risk Rating 2.0, that aims to address a situation where nearly half of the flood claims received by Fema are from people outside zones where insurance is required. Around three-quarters of the 4.9m federal insurance policyholders will pay more for their premiums. “We’ve learned that the old way of looking at risk had lots of gaps, which understated a property’s flood risk and communicated a false sense of security,” said David Maurstad, a senior executive of the national flood insurance program, told AP. The elevated premiums have been opposed by some members of Congress, who argue it will hurt people who require affordable housing, but Eisenman said the reforms do not go far enough as they do not actually curb new building on risky floodplains. “Much more profound changes are needed,” he said. Instances of ‘nuisance’ flooding, where high tides exacerbated by sea level rise cause streets and homes to fill with water, have increased dramatically along US coastlines in recent years and more powerful storms, fueled by a heating atmosphere, are bringing heavier bursts of rainfall to parts of the country. Rising sea levels alone could force around 13m Americans to relocate by the end of the century, research has found. For many people, however, moving is not an option, due to financial constraints or ties to home. “There is a great concern and fear because everything is at risk, even people’s lives,” said Rebecca Jim, who lives in the Cherokee nation in Oklahoma. Miami, a city in the area, has been regulary flooded by water that washes toxins from a nearby mining site onto homes, schools and businesses. “It’s foolish and criminal that more building is allowed on floodplains. But much of what is flooded here is tribal land and people here aren’t moving from that.”",News/Environment,‘Everything is at risk’: flood survivors urge Congress to change inadequate insurance,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/07/flood-survivors-congress-overhaul-insurance-policy
1/7/2022,"David Howell scored a rare English victory in high-class international competition this week when the three-time British champion won chess.com’s weekly Titled Tuesday. The Sussex 31-year-old had just returned from Warsaw, where he performed well in the World Rapid with 8/13, but faded in the World Blitz with 10/21. Titled Tuesday is free to enter for all Fide titled players, right down to 2200-rated Candidate Masters, and regularly attracts hundreds of entries, who play an 11-round Swiss with a three minutes per game time limit plus a one-second increment.  This week’s top seeds were the blitz No 1 and five-time US champion, Hikaru Nakamura, plus the Russians Ian Nepomniachtchi and Alexander Grischuk. Nakamura is Titled Tuesday’s most prolific winner, and competed despite still being stuck in Warsaw after testing positive and withdrawing from the World Blitz. Howell’s shrewdest move on Tuesday turned out to be his unintentional third-round loss to an outsider, creating for himself a “Swiss gambit” where a player is behind the pack on points but gets the benefit of weaker opponents while his rivals are paired together. The crunch came in the final round where Howell met the No 5 seed, Jeffery Xiong, in a sharp Scotch Game where Black chose the ambitious 12…Qg6? instead of the safe 12…f6. The queen looked active but Harry the h pawn and a white rook trapped it in just six moves and Howell soon wrapped up the game. His web handle is howitzer14, and he is believed to be the first English winner in all the years of Titled Tuesday, which began as a monthly event in 2014 and has since become weekly. It has been an unusual week for Nigel Short, who last month was hospitalised with coronavirus and Tweeted a selfie from his hospital bed with the caption: “Good morning everyone. How is your day?” This week Short felt recovered enough to accept an invitation to the Vergani Cup at Cattolica, Italy (Beniamino Vergani is best known for finishing 22nd and last with 3/21 in the great tournament of Hastings 1895). The 1993 world title challenger’s uncertain start could have been much worse: in round two he overlooked a tactic and was losing to a lowly rated 14-year-old, Lorenzo Candian, escaping only because the teenager’s mobile phone rang, triggering an automatic default under Fide tournament rules. Back in the 2008 European Union championship in Liverpool, Short had himself dropped a point to his mobile. He had switched it off at the start of the game and put it on the table in view of his opponent, Keti Arakhamia-Grant, but the low battery warning overrode the switched-off status. Next round at Cattolica was better and Short gained the point when his opponent, under pressure from both position and clock at move 36, missed that he could draw by Kg8 or Rf5 and instead blundered into defeat. Another win came in Thursday’s sixth round, which, despite a few inaccuracies, was played in the simple yet elegant style of Short’s best years. As a result, he jumped into a multiple tie for second on 4.5/6, behind Iran’s No 2, Amin Tatatabaei, on 5/6. The final three rounds will be testing, since so far Short has avoided the other top ranked players who are now congregated in the lead. Rounds seven and eight on Friday and Saturday (3pm start) and round nine (9.30am Sunday) should be interesting for online spectators. Hastings is cancelled, the London Classic had no Open, next weekend’s 4NCL league weekend is postponed, and England’s other 2600+ grandmasters have been inactive in major competitions. It seems like an echo of a century ago in the 1920s when the Bradford bank clerk Fred Yates and the badminton baronet Sir George Thomas were virtually alone as regulars on the European tournament circuit. In the latest Titled Tuesday, GM Gawain Jones (handle VerdeNotte), who normally does well, retired after starting with 1/4; and otherwise there were just two IMs and a CM from England. Yet Titled Tuesday is clearly an invaluable free training tool for some of the world’s fast rising stars. It has been suggested that English players dislike the event because of its 6pm GMT start and late-night finish, but time zone problems are far greater for Russian and Asian GMs and IMs, who compete in large numbers. It ought to be possible to encourage many more titled English players to take part in Titled Tuesday. ECF prizes for the best scores by English juniors and female players, groups for whom the national federation has dedicated funds; a requirement that the 2600-plus GMs should play at the event as part of their preparation for Olympiads and European team championships; awards for the highest placed sub-2600s – some or all of these could work. There would also be a knock-on effect as strong players without Fide titles would have an incentive to qualify for them. Some time in the near or distant future, when Covid-19 is a distant memory, there will be better alternatives for strong English players.than a masters online tournament. But for now Titled Tuesday is an inexpensive, available and useful experience which the ECF should be doing much more to support. If the event had been around in the 1970s, the golden English generation would have jumped at it. The new World Rapid Champion, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, helped hone the skills which defeated Carlsen et al by competing in Titled Tuesday most weeks for many months, This week, the 17-year-old was honoured in Uzbekistan with a €20,000 cash prize and the keys to a two-room apartment, at a ceremony held at the National Olympic Committee in Tashkent. 3797: 1 Nxf4!

1/7/2022,"The word Demerara probably means nothing to you, other than being the name of a large-grained golden brown sugar. But Demerara is a place, or it was. Part of what is now called Guyana, Demerara was a British territory rich in sugar plantations. It was one of the most lucrative colonies, owing to the high yield of the land and high productivity of the enslaved people who worked on it, productivity extracted via exceptional brutality. The enslaved outnumbered the white colonists significantly, so it was thought that their treatment needed to be particularly harsh, so as not to encourage rebellion. That came anyway, in 1823. Thomas Harding tells the story of one of the lesser known uprisings of the colonial era, but his book is not just a work of narrative nonfiction, it is an attempt to illustrate that Britain needs to acknowledge the country’s “white debt”, how much of its greatness it owes to the exploitation of enslaved people. For Harding, it’s personal. His ancestors, through trade in tobacco and other commodities grown on plantations, benefited from slavery. But Harding is also Jewish, and descended from Germans who either perished in the Holocaust or were forced to flee and had their property stolen. Harding received a sum in restitution from the German government, and these reparations compelled him to examine the other part of his family’s legacy. “If I was willing to identify as a victim in my father’s family, to receive reparations from the German government, then surely I had better understand Britain’s role in slavery,” he writes.  Harding understands how much of Britain’s history is skewed towards narratives that portray it as the virtuous protagonist in the account of slavery because the actual protagonists, the enslaved themselves, were never the centre of their own stories. He corrects this by carefully researching the characters of those enslaved on Demerara, and paying attention to how they are described. He replaces “slave” with “enslaved men and women”, as well as putting in quotation marks all markers of ownership – “purchased”, “belonged”, “owned”. Those who participated in the uprising he refers to as “abolitionists” – the term “rebels” implies that they were challenging a legitimate system. The effect is striking, demonstrating that slavery was not just the way things were, but a daily aberration in which one class actively suppressed another. With these small but considered edits, Harding delivers a masterclass in how authors of history can play an active role, for good and for bad, in how these moral questions are framed. The account of the uprising itself centres on its participants, their shattered bodies and shattered dreams, their domestic lives and stirring hopes for emancipation. As the uprising surges and then is violently suppressed, I found myself asking: why didn’t I know about this? Why are we so familiar (as Harding himself observes) with the drawl of the American slaveowner and the caricatures of slavery in movies such as Django Unchained, but not with the large cast of British characters? The answer is that it is those characters who got to write British history. And through slavery, they amassed such wealth and influence that, like John Gladstone, the largest slave “owner” in Demerara and a fierce anti-abolitionist, they managed to launch themselves from relatively humble beginnings intothe ranks of landed gentry and political aristocracy.. Gladstone’s fortune from slavery sent his sons to Eton, and one of them was prime minister William Gladstone. White Debt is written sparingly – there are no sanctimonious lectures on the evils of slavery or chastisements of the British establishment for promoting a false version of history. Harding is almost apologetic in his entreaties to consider reparations, which he believes are due both in financial terms, and as formal acknowledgment of the injustices of slavery. But the book is nonetheless infuriating for its wealth of information that should be common knowledge yet is not, buried under the celebratory propaganda of Britain’s abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. The uprising happened after that abolition, because despite the fact that the British parliament passed a law in 1807 prohibiting the Atlantic slave trade, the shipping and selling of enslaved people between British colonies was still permitted and Demerara became a thriving market. Harding argues that the Demerara uprising played a larger role than it is given in changing British attitudes towards slavery. But more broadly, the whitewashing of the violent suppression of the uprising at the time, in the British press and parliament, feels sickeningly contemporary. White Debt is full of details that will send a chill down your spine. Michael M’Turk, one of the most brutal slave “owners” in Demerara, who executed one of the abolitionists during the uprisings and strung up his body as a warning to others, cleverly anticipated when the tide against slavery would turn. He presented fake testimonials of his care for the enslaved to Queen Victoria, and managed to secure a knighthood and a place in the history books as someone who was on the right side of history. In his actions, there is no more fitting metaphor for the country as a whole. Britain not only expunged its own record of brutality towards the enslaved, it cast itself as their saviour.
