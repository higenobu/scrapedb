3/28/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an interview to five prominent Russian journalists in which the Ukrainian president discussed the Russian invasion and Kyiv’s conditions for a peace deal. The Russian journalists mostly came from media outlets openly critical of the war: Novaya Gazeta’s Dmitry Muratov, TV Rain’s Tikhon Dzyadko, author Mikhail Zygar, Meduza’s Ivan Kolpakov and Kommersant’s Vladimir Solovyov. Not all of them could publish the remarks. Both Novaya Gazeta and Kommersant complied with the Russian censor’s ban on publishing the remarks, while most of the other outlets have been banned in Russia. The easiest way for Russians to see what Zelenskiy said is on social media. More than 112,000 people have watched the interview in Russian on Zygar’s YouTube page and some quotes have been shared on Telegram. Russians need a VPN to read websites like TV Rain or Meduza. On Monday, Novaya Gazeta announced that it was halting operations because it had received a second warning for violating Russia’s “foreign agents” law, likely in retaliation for the interview with Zelenskiy. The newspaper would cease to publish new material until the end of the “special military operation,” the official term for Russia’s war in Ukraine. The decision marks the temporary closure of Russia’s largest remaining independent media. Zelenskiy has made several attempts to appeal directly to Russians about the war and has said repeatedly that they can best convince Putin to abandon his invasion of Ukraine. In an address shortly after the outbreak of the war, Zelenskiy addressed the Russian population in Russian (his native language): “If the Russian leaders don’t want to sit with us behind the table for the sake of peace, maybe they will sit behind the table with you. Do Russians want the war? I would like to know the answer. But the answer depends only on you, citizens of the Russian Federation.” Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine is ready to discuss a “neutral status” with Russia, presumably one that would preclude the country from joining Nato, in exchange for security guarantees from attack in the future. This is not a new statement from Zelenskiy, but it nonetheless generated headlines as Ukraine and Russia go into a new round of negotiations in Istanbul this week. Zelenskiy also said that any agreement about “neutrality” would need to be confirmed in a nationwide referendum that would include Ukrainians who have been forced to flee the country. More than 10 million people have been displaced by the Russian invasion according to some estimates. The referendum could not take place while Russian forces remained on newly-captured Ukrainian territory, he added, demanding Russian forces return to the territory they controlled before 24 February. “It’s a compromise,” he said. “Go back to where it all started, and there we will try to solve the issue of Donbas.” Probably not. Russia seems intent on capturing as much Ukrainian territory as possible before taking negotiations seriously. And Ukraine’s staunch defence of major cities has also galvanised the population, making it less likely that the public would accept any Russian ultimatum in a national referendum. Zelenskiy has already made similar offers to discuss the country’s neutral status. But the need for Russia to leave territory that it has captured by force and for the west to step in as guarantors of a new security agreement conflicts with Putin’s core goal in this war: a Russian sphere of influence in eastern Europe. Poorly. By Monday afternoon, the Kremlin claimed that Vladimir Putin still had not read what was said in the interview and said that any meeting between Zelenskiy and Putin at the moment would only be “counterproductive”. Meanwhile, the Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor had warned news outlets not to run the interview with Zelenskiy, part of a wartime censorship effort that has also forbidden local media from calling the events an “attack”, “invasion”, or “war”. Outlets like Meduza and TV Rain have already been banned in Russia, so they can run the material freely. But others like Novaya Gazeta and Kommersant have elected to toe the government line, meaning that the interview won’t appear in their publications. Russian society is polarised, so it’s unlikely an interview is going to change many minds. Those who read outlets like Meduza or TV Rain are far more likely to be opposed to the war, so they are likely receptive of Zelenskiy’s point of view and want the Kremlin to abandon its invasion of Ukraine. But the fact that it hasn’t been run by more mainstream outlets like Kommersant means that many Russians will not see Zelenskiy’s interview, or will only see what state media eventually chooses to publish from it.",News/World news,Will Zelenskiy’s interview with Russian media make a difference in war?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/ukraine-zelenskiy-interview-russian-media-make-difference-in-war
3/28/2022,"Ministers are to launch a new national behaviour survey as part of its plans to improve standards and lift attainment in schools in England. It is one of a package of measures outlined in a schools white paper unveiled on Monday, which also includes ambitious new attainment targets for all primary and secondary pupils across the country. The government says good behaviour is key to enabling effective learning and is currently consulting on new guidance for behaviour in schools, including the use of suspensions and permanent exclusions. The white paper, the first for six years, also announced plans to ensure that all schools in England offer a minimum school week of 32.5 hours, as well as an ambition for all schools to join academy trusts by 2030, with new powers for councils to establish their own academy trusts. Launching the schools white paper on Monday, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, promised to “spread brilliance” across the country, giving every single child, whoever and wherever they are “an outstanding education”. “I don’t believe that kids in Knowlsey are less talented than kids in Kensingston, they just haven’t had the same opportunity, that’s the difference – and I’m determined to make a difference to change that,” he said. At the core of the government’s plans is the ambition for 90% of children to leave primary school having achieved the expected standard in reading, writing and maths – a sizeable jump from just 65% in 2019. At secondary level, meanwhile, the government wants an increase in the GCSE average grade in English language and maths from 4.5 to 5. “This stuff is eminently doable,” Zahawi told an audience of parents and teachers at the launch of the white paper at Monega primary school in Newham in east London, where he drew parallels between the success of the coronavirus vaccine rollout and his plans for lifting educational standards. But research published simultaneously by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) , demonstrated the huge challenge still facing schools dealing with the continuing impact of the pandemic on learning, with children’s attainment still lagging behind because of lost learning. While learning losses for primary pupils in the 2021/2022 autumn term have shown some signs of recovery since the summer term, for pupils in secondary schools, the EPI said there had been further losses in reading over this period. Report author Jon Andrews said: “Our latest data shows a reduction in the extent of lost learning in primary maths since the summer. However, what is particularly concerning is the performance of secondary-aged pupils. “Far from showing signs of recovery, they appear to be showing a greater degree of learning loss than they did at the end of the last school year. Disadvantaged children in secondary schools also appear to be falling further behind their non-disadvantaged peers in their reading.” Teaching unions warned that the government’s vision for the future of education in England would not be realised without additional funding and resources. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “This is a white paper which does not reflect on the mistakes of the past, does not address the problems of the Covid present and does not have the answers for the future. “Its message is that the education of the future will be a souped up version of what we have seen over the last decade. Schools and their students need better than that. This is not the vision of education recovery which is needed for England.” She said schools were being “battered” by a storm of real problems with inadequate funding levels, increasing child poverty, a widening attainment gap, problems with teacher recruitment and retention and an outdated qualifications system. “The white paper does not recognise the seriousness and depth of these issues. Even where it points to important problems, such as mental health, support for SEND [special educational needs and disability] and behaviour, it does not commit sufficient funding to them.” Dr Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “The ambitions set out in the white paper will not be delivered unless they are matched with the funding and resources needed to meet the challenges facing the education system today.”",News/Education,Plans for England’s schools include national behaviour survey ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/28/plans-for-englands-schools-include-national-behaviour-survey
3/28/2022,"The ending of the UK’s first “zero-emissions street” scheme has led to a return to illegal pollution levels beside one of the country’s biggest cultural centres. Pollution levels had plummeted on Beech Street in London, which runs past the Barbican centre, after the City of London Corporation introduced an experimental traffic order restricting it to electric vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. But in September last year the City ended the order, welcoming diesel and petrol vans, cars and cabs back into the street. Levels of nitrogen dioxide, which damages the respiratory tracts of people and animals and causes lung disease, are once again above legal limits. The latest data from London Air shows that so far this year the average level of NO2 recorded at Beech Street has been 43 micrograms per cubic metre. The legal limit is an average of 40µg/m3 over the course of a year. The latest World Health Organization guidance suggests a limit of 10µg/m3. “Dirty air is back on show at the Barbican,” said Oliver Lord, the UK head of the Clean Cities Campaign, who commissioned the analysis of the air quality on Beech Street by Imperial College London. “Reopening Beech Street to polluting diesel vehicles has led to higher levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide, with the street at risk of breaching legal limits once again. “The City’s commitment for a zero-emission zone at the Barbican must be brought forward as soon as possible otherwise it is at risk of negligence by giving cleaner air and then taking it away.” Beech Street, a road tunnel passing beneath a section of the Barbican estate in the City of London, from which fumes cannot disperse easily, had for years been a notorious pollution hotspot. Before the scheme, the average air concentration of NO2 was 58µg/m3. “Beech Street experiences high levels of air pollution as it is a busy, enclosed thoroughfare,” the City had said as it launched the zero-emissions scheme in March 2020. “A significant improvement in air quality is expected, resulting in health benefits for the many pedestrians and cyclists that use the street.” Levels of NO2 fell 67%, to 19.5µg/m3, even without any enforcement beyond signs and markings. However, this was at the same time as the first coronavirus lockdown and a general fall in traffic. After lockdown restrictions were eased and life began to return to the city streets, and enforcement measures implemented, there was a slight increase in NO2 levels, to an average of 24.7µg/m3. Louise Mittal, of the Environmental Research Group at Imperial College London and a co-author of the report, said: “We found that there was a drop in NO2 concentrations when the zero-emissions street was in place. It went down more than other sites in London, then it went back up again when the street was removed. Basically we saw an improvement when the scheme was in place,” she said. Overall, only about 930 vehicles a day used Beech Street during the scheme, compared with 9,500 before restrictions began. About 34,000 penalty tickets were issued to motorists caught driving through the road in petrol or diesel vehicles. The City of London has said it ended the Beech Street scheme because the 18-month time limit for its experimental traffic order had expired. Last December, members of the corporation voted to launch a public consultation to make the Beech Street scheme permanent.",News/UK news,Pollution back at illegal levels on former ‘zero-emissions street’ in London,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/28/pollution-back-at-levels-on-former-zero-emissions-street-in-london
3/28/2022,"People living in some northern Italian towns face fines for wasting water as mayors ration supplies amid a severe drought. Italy has had one of its driest winters in the last 65 years, with rainfall 80% lower than the seasonal average. The situation has been more acute in northern regions, where some areas have been deprived of significant rainfall for three months or more. The Po, the country’s longest river, is at its lowest level recorded in winter since 1972. Mayors of towns in regions including Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy and Trentino have introduced water-rationing measures, ranging from fountains being switched off and nightly restrictions on tap water to bans on using water for gardens and allotments, for washing cars and filling swimming pools. Fines of up to €500 are in place for those deemed to be squandering supplies. “I don’t ever recall a situation of this kind in winter. We haven’t had any rain since 8 December,” said Francesco Pietrasanta, the mayor of Quarona, a town in Piedmont. “There are issues with water wells, some areas have had to be supplied by water tanks. The rule is to only use water for real necessity, such as for hygiene or food reasons.” In Bajardo, a village in Liguria, the water supply to taps has been switched off between 8pm and 8am. Its mayor, Francesco Laura, said he had no choice. “The springs have dried up,” he told La Stampa. “The water from the mountains no longer comes, and in the village the little that comes from taps is used for cooking and washing.” Laura said there had been little or no rain in the village since October 2020. The winter drought followed an intense, protracted heatwave across Italy last summer. In August, Siracusa in Sicily is believed to have broken the European record for the highest temperature when it recorded a figure of 48.8C. Snowfall has also been below average this winter. Scientists have long predicted that the climate crisis and global heating would lead to more frequent extreme weather. “It hasn’t snowed and it hasn’t rained in six months,” Massimo Niero, the mayor of Cisano sul Neva, in Liguria, told the local newspaper, Il Vostro Giornale. “There will be problems in the summer.” Rain is forecast in the north and the rest of Italy from Wednesday, although Pietrasanta said it would need to be significant to resolve the water shortage. “We might get some rain on Friday but I’m not sure it will be enough,” he said. “This situation ought to make us think about changing policy to manage water in a different way, especially with climate change.”",News/World news,Italians face fines for wasting water as supplies rationed amid drought,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/italy-fines-for-wasting-water-as-supplies-rationed-amid-drought
3/28/2022,"Face-to-face peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are likely to start in Turkey on Tuesday, the Kremlin has said, as Kyiv insisted that with Moscow’s invasion largely stalled it was not prepared to make any concessions on its territorial integrity. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed on Sunday that ceasefire talks would be held in Istanbul, possibly beginning as early as the following day. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday, however, that Tuesday was more likely. Further comment could “only hurt the negotiation process” but the fact talks were “continuing to take place in person is, of course, important”, he said. Officials have played down the chances of a major breakthrough, but observers said the two sides’ first in-person encounter since a bad-tempered meeting between the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in Antalya on 10 March was a sign that the dynamics may be shifting. Kyiv has suggested that with Russia’s invasion forces held up by stiff Ukrainian resistance, heavy losses and mounting tactical and logistical problems, Moscow may be more willing to compromise as its hopes of installing a new government fade. Having failed in its attempt to encircle the Ukrainian capital and force the government’s capitulation, the Russian defence ministry said last week that it was shifting its focus to expanding the territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Both sides have spoken of a possible formula under which Ukraine might accept some kind of formal neutral status, but neither has shifted on Russia’s territorial claims which include Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014, and the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said at the weekend that some form of compromise involving Donbas may be possible but did not suggest the region might be ceded, making clear that “territorial integrity” was Kyiv’s priority. Lavrov said a meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy – who have met only once, in Paris in 2019 – would be counterproductive at this stage, and that one would be needed “as soon as we are close to resolving all key issues”. He repeated that Russia’s demands included Ukraine’s demilitarisation, “denazification” and future neutrality, and said the current crisis had “been brewing so long, all these years, that a huge number of problems have built up”. Zelenskiy, who has suggested the question of neutrality should be put to voters in a referendum after Russian troops withdraw, said Kyiv “understands it is impossible to liberate all territory by force” but that his country’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt”. “Effective security guarantees are mandatory,” he said. Peskov said Russia “cannot see any substantial achievements or breakthroughs so far”, a sentiment Vadym Denysenko, a Ukrainian interior ministry adviser, echoed on Monday. Peskov also said comments on Saturday by the US president, Joe Biden, in which he described Putin as a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power”, as alarming. The White House has denied Biden was seeking regime change in Moscow. In an interview with the Economist, Zelenskiy said he did not think Putin “visualises in his own mind the same Ukraine we see. He sees Ukraine as a part of his world, his worldview, but that doesn’t correspond with what’s happened over the last 30 years.” He said Moscow was “throwing Russian soldiers like logs into a train’s furnace” and criticised the west’s sanctions as “incomplete”. “We believe in victory. It’s impossible to believe in anything else,” he said. “We will definitely win because this is our home, on our land, our independence. It’s just a question of time.” Russia’s invasion, which was launched on 24 February, has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million people from their homes, including almost 4 million who have fled abroad, mainly to Poland. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the situation in Mariupol was “catastrophic”, with about 170,000 civilians encircled by Russian forces and supplies of food, water and medicine dwindling fast. France, Greece and Turkey are hoping to launch a mass evacuation from the southern port city within days. Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said on Monday that the invasion had so far cost the country nearly $565bn (£431bn) in terms of damage to infrastructure, lost economic growth and other factors, with 8,000km (4,970 miles) of roads and 10m square metres of housing damaged or destroyed. Ukrainian forces went on the offensive last week, pushing Russian troops back in areas around Kyiv and in the north-east and the south-west. Russia’s armoured columns are largely bogged down, with trouble resupplying and making little or no progress, although they continue to pulverise residential areas. “As of today, the enemy is regrouping its forces, but they cannot advance anywhere in Ukraine,” the country’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, said on Monday. A senior Ukrainian military official said the country’s defence forces were holding back Russian troops trying to break through from the north-east and north-west, while in the south they were focused on defending the cities of Krivy Rih, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolayiv.",News/World news,"Ukraine and Russia likely to begin face-to-face talks on Tuesday, Kremlin says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/ukraine-and-russia-likely-to-begin-face-to-face-talks-on-tuesday-kremlin-says
3/28/2022,"The international players’ union has expressed “deep concerns” over the handling of the investigation into widespread sexual abuse in Gabon after it received allegations that individuals with close ties to the country’s football federation have issued threats against alleged victims and alleged witnesses “in an attempt to silence them”. Fifpro has called on Fifa to intervene after several alleged victims and multiple alleged witnesses gave testimonies that claimed there were “a series of high-profile and serial abusers, who are deeply embedded in Gabonese footballing structures”. The investigation into allegations of widespread sexual abuse in Gabonese football over the last two decades was opened by the Gabon federation, Fegafoot, in December after Patrick Assoumou Eyi – known as “Capello” – was accused of raping, grooming and exploiting young players. He and two other coaches are facing charges of raping minors and sexual assault after claims by alleged victims were reported by the Guardian, while Serge Mombo - a leading Fegafoot official - was arrested after being accused of sexually abusing young players and demanding sex as a condition of them securing places in national teams. All four have denied the claims. Last month, Fifpro wrote to Fifa outlining its concerns that Fegafoot had a conflict of interest and was “therefore not fit for purpose to investigate such serious allegations.” But in a statement on Monday, it said that it had received no satisfactory response to those concerns and had therefore initiated a preliminary and independent investigation last year. “The findings of those preliminary investigations are deeply concerning,” said the statement. “We have identified several [people] who spoke of a series of high-profile and serial abusers, who are deeply embedded in Gabonese footballing structures. These individuals were allowed to continue to abuse their position despite concerns being raised both publicly and privately with the most senior individuals at Fegafoot. Indeed, a review of public sources by our investigatory team show that senior Fegafoot officials acknowledged they knew about the allegations of abuse. In short, it was an open secret that was not addressed for years. “Further, we have notified Fifa of concerning allegations that individuals with close ties to Fegafoot have issued threats against players and witnesses who may have evidence relevant to any investigation in an attempt to silence them. Fifpro has therefore again called on Fifa to ensure a competent and independent investigation takes place. We will continue to use our position and influence to ensure that the courage of the whistleblowers does not go unnoticed.” Fifa confirmed in January that its independent ethics committee had opened an investigation into the allegations. A Fifa spokesperson subsequently told the Guardian that it had been in contact with Fegafoot and Fifpro regarding the investigation but would not comment further “since the matter is ongoing”. A spokesperson for Fegafoot told the BBC that Fegafoot itself “is also a victim” and said that its ethics committee would conduct an independent investigation. Fifpro’s statement also noted that Fegafoot has failed to restart football since the pandemic, “despite receiving significant financial assistance as part of the Fifa Covid-19 relief plan”. No top-tier football is currently being played in the country, while Fifpro said that non-payment of the women’s national team players is “a recurring issue”. “We have also received reports of a common practice in Fegafoot to retain and/or confiscate passports from players to make sure that players remain silent on various issues. Against this catalogue of failings, Fifpro has repeatedly expressed concerns about Fegafoot’s competence to manage a complex and sensitive investigation into sexual abuse.” Fegafoot and Fifa have been approached for comment.",Sport/Football,Concern grows over investigation into alleged sexual abuse in Gabonese football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/concern-grows-over-investigation-into-alleged-sexual-abuse-in-gabonese-football
3/28/2022,"One of the UK’s top universities is helping to bring hundreds of Ukrainians fleeing war to Britain in a groundbreaking scheme combining sanctuary with education. King’s College London is working with Citizens UK, an umbrella charity with hundreds of member organisations, on a blueprint to bring Ukrainian refugees fleeing war to the UK. It is aiming to bring hundreds of refugees to the UK by Easter. The government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme is based on community sponsorship but so far many of those who have come forward to help have been individuals. Prior to the Ukraine war a government community sponsorship scheme for refugees has operated for several years. However, this is the first time a university is acting as a community sponsor for a large number of refugees. King’s has a history of working on migration issues. Alongside academic research, its Sanctuary programme has helped refugees study while in camps in Jordan and Lebanon. The university worked with the Home Office and the UN high commission for refugees (UNHCR) to get itself approved as a community sponsor for the first time in December 2021 to help a Syrian refugee student and her family come to the UK. That student is due to start a degree in electronic engineering at King’s later this year. When Russia invaded Ukraine, King’s, working with Citizens UK, decided there was an urgent need to scale up the model. It is understood that about 20 other universities have expressed interest in getting involved. King’s and Citizens UK will be helping to bring Ukrainians to Britain as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, not only helping Ukrainian students who have had their university studies interrupted to find ways to continue with their education, but also providing at least six months of hosting with families working for the university. They will also assist with practicalities such as making applications for universal credit. King’s professor of global health and social medicine, Bronwyn Parry, (corr) said the first phase of the programme will match students with participating universities providing similar courses so they can try to keep in touch with their studies. The students and their families may be deeply traumatised on arrival in Britain so will not have make immediate decisions about whether they will do a degree in the UK or stay here long term. “As the UK’s first university to act as a community sponsor for a refugee student and their family displaced by the Syrian war, King’s is ideally placed to support other universities in their ambitions to host displaced students and academics,” said Parry. The second phase of the scheme will help students who decide they do want to stay in the UK to secure scholarships to do so. Jonathan Cox, the deputy director of Citizens UK, said his organisation has a target of bringing more than 1,000 displaced Ukrainians to the UK by Easter. Not all will be linked to the university community sponsorship scheme but it is hoped that about 250 will be. Cox described the initiative between Citizens UK, King’s and other universities as “absolutely groundbreaking”. He said his organisation was working with an organisation in Warsaw to match refugees to university hosts and that emphasis would be placed on carrying out appropriate disclosure and barring service (DBS) and other checks. “We are doing this in a way that achieves scale but is also safe,” he said.",News/Education,King’s College helping to bring hundreds of Ukrainian refugees to Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/28/kings-college-helping-to-bring-hundreds-of-ukrainian-refugees-to-britain
3/28/2022,"If this year’s Oscars had a spirit animal, you’d have to say it was Les Dawson. An uncharacteristically aggressive and unfunny Dawson, perhaps. But the 94th Academy Awards proved to be an evening unexpectedly rich in “her-indoors” gags for the lads, while women stood on the sidelines making abashed cracks about their own physical shortcomings. The most generous possible reading of Chris Rock’s joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, for instance, is that he simply finds the idea of a woman having short hair hilarious. This does not seem unlikely. After all, his preceding gag concerned the domestic nightmare which would await poor Javier Bardem should he win best actor but his missus, Penélope Cruz, fail to bag best actress. You know what women are like! Four years on from #MeToo, the Oscars’ feminism has turned flimsy and performative with whiplash speed. This was hard to predict: the dial only seemed to be turning one way. In 2018, Kevin Hart relieved himself from Oscars duties just days after he was announced as the host, following the discovery of homophobic tweets. This year saw the return to the podium of hosts for the first time in four years: all of them women, none of them known for taking prisoners. Yet, under the direction of incoming telecast producer Will Packer – a longtime collaborator of Hart’s, as it happens – nobody on stage on Sunday seemed as intent on undoing any progress as Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes. In one skit, Sykes dragged up as Venus and Serena Williams’ father, Richard, apparently for the sole purpose of complaining about how much hair she had to shave from her legs. Schumer’s routine majored on pointing out to the audience that she was still to shed all her baby weight, three years after the birth of her son. She then dangled from the ceiling in a skin-tight Spider-Man outfit that turned her into a floating punchline – a human piñata to be whacked with our best lines. This was the sort of shtick Rebel Wilson used to peddle prior to her recent radical health drive. As witnessed at the Baftas a fortnight ago, Wilson has traded it instead for a sort of angry horniness, with most jokes adhering to the template of her desperation to perform that particular sexual favour on this particular actor. The lucky recipient of the sexually desperate baton on Sunday was Hall, a dignified and interesting actor, who somehow mentioned she was single in her first appearance and, in her second, summoned hand-picked actors for a “naked” Covid test, eventually giving Jason Momoa a substantial pat-down. The longer the night lasted, the more Dawson’s influence waned. Next year, they should just refashion the statuette in the image of Benny Hill.",Arts/Film,"Four years on from #MeToo, the Oscars’ feminism has gone backwards | Catherine Shoard",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/four-years-on-from-metoo-the-oscars-feminism-has-gone-rapidly-backwards
3/28/2022,"It was the alt-history, the policy that didn’t get enacted. No-Covid, zero-Covid or elimination aimed to stamp out community transmission of Covid-19 in a given area, rather than just reduce it to “manageable” levels. Most of the world eschewed it, and it got bad press from the start. Only autocratic regimes could pull it off, one mantra went. Countries like China and ah, New Zealand and, oops, that notorious police state Davis in California. There was something of the self-fulfilling prophecy about this. Many people thought No-Covid was impossible, but the handful of places that embraced it proved them wrong. Now that some of those places are themselves shifting to a reduction or mitigation strategy, countries that opted for mitigation from the beginning are enjoying a “we told you so” moment. But No-Covid’s early champions had to shift in part because other countries let the virus rip. Even if their strategy didn’t remain the optimal one, it bought them time to prepare others. It’s important that we remember that when the next pandemic sidles along. The power of language is terrifying sometimes. We talk about pandemics “erupting” – I’ve done it myself – but sidling seems a more appropriate verb for something that grows quietly in the dark before exploding into the light. The concept of exponential growth is one we have trouble grasping, yet grasping it empowers us. It means that for a time the disease spread is limited and potentially controllable. It means that explosive growth falls off rapidly once it is deprived of fuel. And it means that not everybody has to pursue elimination for it to succeed – as long as a critical mass do. No-Covid was dogged by problems of definition. People confused elimination with eradication, for example. Only one human disease, smallpox, has been eradicated, but plenty have been eliminated. The UK was measles-free until 2017, when partly, due to low vaccine uptake, it lost that status. Elimination is not an unattainable dream, but it does require a concerted effort. In the current pandemic, the word often applied to such efforts was “restrictions”, as if the efforts themselves deprived us of liberty. No. The virus deprives us of liberty; the efforts preserve it. That’s why nobody in Davis is complaining, 18 months into their No-Covid experiment, and why they’re puzzled other US towns haven’t followed suit. Though lockdowns might have been necessary in the beginning, because we had no other shields against the virus, they soon stopped being synonymous with elimination. Cheap mass testing plus isolation of the infected, ventilation, masking, distancing and – importantly – social and financial support for those inconvenienced by these measures, became the preferred tools, used most effectively in combination. The claim that elimination exacerbates inequality is a red herring; it doesn’t, with the right support. A circulating virus certainly does, on the other hand, by preferentially encountering gig workers, keeping kids out of school, and closing mental health clinics. It’s true that some diseases are easier to eliminate than others. Many western countries assumed that Covid would behave like flu, and decided that elimination would be too difficult. China assumed that it would behave like Sars, which it successfully beat 20 years ago. It actually behaves a bit like both, but not exactly like either. Countries tended to get the outcome they aimed for. Last June, a study in The Lancet showed that those that chose elimination over mitigation did a better job of protecting life, the economy and civil liberties – the hat-trick. But no country is an island to a highly transmissible virus – even those that are islands – and the emergence of Delta and Omicron variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, combined with the rollout of vaccines that protect against severe disease and death, was bound to change the calculus. Some who favoured elimination previously now think it has outlived its usefulness. New Zealand, for example, has switched to a mitigation strategy. Epidemiologist Michael Baker expects his country’s high levels of vaccination will protect it from a wave of hospitalisations and deaths as Omicron sweeps the country. Hong Kong, which also pursued No-Covid until recently, has tragically not avoided that fate, due to its relatively low vaccination rates. The lesson from Hong Kong is not that elimination doesn’t work, it’s that you need a plan B in case the context changes. Baker and economist Donald Low, who has chronicled Hong Kong’s experience, agree that elimination was the right strategy for the first 18 months of the pandemic. Baker stands by his analysis of December 2020 that, “Elimination might be the preferred strategy for responding to new emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential and moderate to high severity, particularly while key parameters are being estimated.” What we’re learning about long Covid – or post-Covid-19 condition as the World Health Organization (WHO) now calls it – only strengthens that case, since it’s looking increasingly likely that countries that tolerated high infection rates, including the UK, are facing a sizeable burden of long-term disability. The vaccines do not stop transmission completely, and by abandoning the non-pharmaceutical interventions that do, those countries also increase the likelihood – far from trivial, as scientists highlighted again this month – that a variant more severe than Omicron or its “stealth” subvariant could arise. These emerging facts demonstrate how pointless it is to cost elimination, or any other containment strategy. How do you measure what it has saved you? In speculative fiction terms, what’s the counterfactual? The right way to respond to an unknown disease is to fix a goal and work towards it, adjusting your strategy as you learn. Because there’s another unknown in the equation, human determination, no response should be ruled out initially. As Nelson Mandela said, and the WHO itself likes to quote: “It’s only impossible until it’s done.” Laura Spinney is a science journalist and the author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World",Opinion/Opinion,"The ‘zero-Covid’ approach got bad press, but it worked – and it could work again  | Laura Spinney",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/no-covid-approach-bad-press-but-worked
