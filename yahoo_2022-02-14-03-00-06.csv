2/14/2022,"A Texas baseball coach was chased and beaten by a group of middle-school students in an act of retaliation against him, news outlets report. The attack was captured on cell phone video now circulating on social media, and shows a Houston high school employee running from four students, who can be seen punching the man and knocking him to the ground. (Warning: This video contains graphic language.) Officials with Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District confirmed to TV station KTRK that the assault took place at Langham Creek High School on Feb. 10. The attackers are students at Aragon Middle School, the outlet reported, and the victim is Michael Shott, an assistant baseball coach and physics teacher at Langham Creek High School. Shott suffered a broken arm from the attack and is recovering, his mother, Peggy Shott, told KTRK. “The reason it happened to him was because he was doing his job,” she said. Students and social media users say Shott was jumped because he told the students they couldn’t ride dirt bikes or ATVs on school grounds, outlets report. The students were arrested, but soon after threats to shoot up the school were made, and the district tightened security, KABB reported. “We couldn’t walk around unless we had an ID badge, they wouldn’t even let us in,” sophomore Alena Gonzales told the TV station. The district sent a letter to parents stating that the juveniles had been taken into custody and would be disciplined, according to the outlet. How they will be disciplined, or if they will face charges, is not clear. “These kids need to get into a whole lot of trouble,” one parent told the station. “I’m just speechless.” In a Feb. 11 release, district officials said the “safety violations that have occurred both on and off our campuses are extremely disappointing.” “Our campuses must be the safest places in our community for students, staff and visitors. We will not tolerate anyone compromising the safe environment of our campuses, and will address violations to the greatest extent possible,” the release said.

2/14/2022,"Sen. Mitch McConnell has been quietly steering a campaign to recruit potential Senate candidates. The New York Times reported on Sunday that it's an effort to gain a GOP majority in the upper chamber. McConnell does not want the ""goofballs"" backed by former President Donald Trump to win. Sen. Mitch McConnell is trying to thwart former President Donald Trump's efforts to shape the GOP, The New York Times reported on Sunday. McConnell and a team of allies have, for months, been leading a behind-the-scenes campaign in which they try to recruit potential Senate candidates who could go up against Trump-backed picks. It's an effort to gain a GOP majority in the Senate, The Times reported. The campaign consists of phone calls, meetings, and polling memos, the paper said. Even after Trump vacated office last January, lawmakers have continued to argue that he maintains a tight hold on the GOP. Last year, for example, Sen. Lindsey Graham said he wanted to leverage Trump's influence to ensure that the Republican party takes back the House and Senate in 2022. In December, Graham suggested that Trump will continue to shape the political sphere and party leaders need to find a way to work with him to avoid getting ostracized. ""If you want to be a Republican leader in the House or the Senate and you don't have a relationship with Donald Trump, you cannot be effective. So I hope we'll get on the same page here,"" The South Carolina lawmaker said. The Republican party can't ""grow"" without him, Graham said last year. And among Republican voters, support for Trump still remains strong. An October poll conducted by Quinnipiac University found that 78% of Republicans want to see Trump in the 2024 presidential election. That number went up from May by 12 percentage points. McConnell, however, believes that Trump is ""losing political altitude,"" The Times said. Since leaving office, Trump has been endorsing candidates running for office across the US. At least 100 people have so far received an endorsement from him since he left the White House, Insider's Warren Rojas and Jake Lahut reported. Those endorsements do not sit well with McConnell, per The Times, who characterized some of his picks as ""goofballs."" A few of McConnell's prospects, who were not identified by The Times, declined his invitation to run for Senate. According to the report, they did not feel comfortable with the possibility of angering the former president.

2/14/2022,"A First World War training round and a 15th century French jetton are among treasures to have been discovered by excavators at the Tower of London. Also found were a late medieval or Tudor buckle, likely to have come from a dagger belt, as well as a 17th-century half penny trade token, which could have been made at the tower's Royal Mint. The discoveries have shed light on the complex and varied history of the 14,000 square metre moat, which has previously been used as a medieval orchard, a grazing ground for Victorian livestock and allotments during the Second World War. A 13th-century moat at the historic site is being transformed into a wildflower meadow for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. This spring, 20 million seeds will be planted in the moat as part of the Superbloom project to celebrate the 70-year reign of Her Majesty. The aim is to create a colourful and vibrant field of flowers so bees and birds will flock back to the capital. The moat will include cornflowers, sunflowers, gyposphila, poppies and pink cosmos, with other garden plants added to the native wildflowers to allow for taller planting schemes and colourful displays throughout the summer. Alfred Hawkins, buildings curator at Historic Royal Palaces, the charity which cares for the Tower of London, said: ""The moat has a very long and complicated history of over 700 years. ""It's a defensive structure, and then it is drained and used as a training ground or for parades. The scale of things that we're finding is reflective of that complicated story."" The discovery of the First World War training round tallies with the Tower of London being a focal point of combat from 1914 to 1918. Soldiers were garrisoned there awaiting deployment at the start of the war and trained to use guns, while weapons were kept in storehouses within the tower. The tower was also used to contain people who posed a serious threat to national security, with 11 spies executed there. The French jetton, inscribed with the fleur-de-lis, is thought to have been made in Paris. While it is not uncommon to find English jettons, French ones are particularly rare. The find demonstrates how the Tower of London was a focal point of international travel. During the Tudor age, the tower was the most important state prison in the country and gained a reputation for being inescapable. The buckle found by excavators may have belonged to one of the guards. In 1977, at the Silver Jubilee, the moat was used for a garden display. In 2014, to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War, it was filled with 800,000 ceramic poppies in a moving commemoration. Visitors will be welcomed to the moat between June and September this year to see the Superbloom. Historic Royal Palaces plans to host smaller floral Jubilee displays across its other sites, including at Hampton Court Palace, Kensington Palace and Hillsborough Castle. Tom O’Leary, public engagement director at Historic Royal Palaces, said: ""We hope that this thriving new landscape, surrounding London’s formidable fortress, will celebrate the power of nature to unite us all.""",World/The Telegraph,Rare treasures unearthed at Tower of London moat shed new light on capital’s ‘formidable fortress’,https://news.yahoo.com/rare-treasures-unearthed-tower-london-150335035.html
2/14/2022,"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday said the trucker protest in Canada would have more impact in the US. ""Our country, I think, is far more of a tinderbox than Canada,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends."" Demonstrators have been protesting vaccine mandates since January 29. Former President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested the ""Freedom Convoy"" trucker protests in Canada would be more influential if the demonstration began in the US. ""I see they have Trump signs all over the place and I'm proud that they do,"" Trump said during a ""Fox & Friends"" interview Saturday morning. ""But that's what happens, you can push people so far and our country is a tinderbox too, don't kid yourself. And there are plenty of [people from] our country up there right now."" ""When you look at what's happening in Canada — our country, I think, is far more of a tinderbox than Canada,"" he continued. —Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 12, 2022 The so-called ""Freedom Convoy"" is made up of Canadian truckers who have been protesting vaccine mandates since late January, blocking major thoroughfares in the country as well as trade routes across the US-Canada border. Vaccines mandates are ""political overreach"" and are ""destroying the foundation of our businesses, industries, and livelihoods,"" organizers said. Trump, last week, said the convoy was ""peacefully protesting the harsh policies of far-left lunatic Justin Trudeau who has destroyed Canada with insane Covid mandates."" Since January 15, Canada has required US truckers to present proof of full vaccination to cross the border. Unvaccinated Canadian truckers who drive to the US have to quarantine and get tested upon their return. The US imposed a similar mandate on January 22. The truckers have so far been protesting for two weeks, and they say they won't stop until all mandates are lifted. It's become a potentially hazardous situation, Canadian police and lawmakers say. Some protesters have set off fireworks, according to police, and blocked roads including the busiest bridge for transporting goods between the US and Canada. Police said hundreds of tickets have been issued for offenses linked to the demonstrations, including driving on sidewalks, driving through no-truck routes, and violating red lights. A war memorial was desecrated during the protests, police said. Last week, the mayor of Ottawa declared a state of emergency, and one lawmaker characterized the event as a ""nationwide insurrection."" The city's police said they've opened dozens of criminal investigations linked to the demonstrations. Insider's Grace Dean contributed to this report.

2/14/2022,"Orange County prosecutors ruled that Deputy Eduardo Duran was justified in his shooting of a homeless Black man. An Orange County sheriff who fatally shot an unarmed homeless Black man in 2020 will not be facing criminal charges, according to the district attorney’s office. In dashcam footage released to the public, deputies Eduardo Duran and Jonathan Israel are seen following 42-year-old Kurt Andras Reinhold in their police cruiser before stopping him on suspicion of jaywalking in a San Clemente neighborhood. The duo then proceeded to detain Reinhold, at one point wrestling him to the ground, before Reinhold, they said, grabbed Israel’s gun holster, prompting Duran to fire two shots at him. The two officers are a part of the department’s homeless outreach liaison. “It is clear from the evidence in this case that Deputy Duran did not commit a crime, and that he was justified when he shot Reinhold,” said Assistant Dist. Atty. Stephen McGreevy in a 20-page letter outlining their investigation. Prosecutors said that after reviewing the footage of the incident and interviewing the officers and several witnesses, Duran was found to be in the right. In a 12-minute video compilation of the dashcam, cellphone and surveillance footage, the two officers were seen watching Reinhold for several minutes before he was seen jaywalking. “Watch this, he’s going to jaywalk,” one of the cops is heard saying as they pull up to Reinhold. The other cop responds, “Don’t make case law.” The video doesn’t capture the moment the cops exit their vehicle, but one is heard saying, “Are you going to stop or are we going to have to make you stop?” “For what,” Reinhold responds. After the cops told Reinhold that he was jaywalking, he responded by saying that their claims are “ridiculous” because he was just walking and tells them to stop touching him. The officers are then seen trying to direct a visibly upset Reinhold back to the sidewalk, before they tackle him to the ground. One of the cops is heard yelling “he’s got my gun,” which seemingly corroborates a previously released still photo of Reinhold’s hand near the gun. However, it is unclear if he took the weapon out of its holster. “These officers are supposedly trained to deal with the homeless,” said John Taylor, an attorney representing Reinhold’s widow, Latoya Reinhold. “They needed to deescalate the situation, rather than escalate it.” Reinhold’s family, including his 7-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter, filed a claim for wrongful death in December 2020. “Jaywalking should not get you killed in Orange County. Being homeless should not get you killed in Orange County,” said Taylor, adding that Reinhold suffered from mental health issues in the past. Attorneys for the family said that they were disappointed but not surprised by the prosecutor’s decision on Friday. Their lawsuit against the department is still ongoing.
