12/13/2021,"A memoir by the late journalist Sarah Hughes, who died from cancer earlier this year, will be published next March, tackling topics from planning your own funeral to the importance of trashy novels. Hughes, who wrote about coping with her illness during the pandemic for the Observer, and was responsible for the Guardian’s episode-by-episode Game of Thrones and Line of Duty recaps, sold the memoir to Bonnier Books imprint Blink in early 2021. She died in April, aged 48, survived by her husband Kris and two children.  The publisher described her memoir, Holding Tight, Letting Go, as “a book about how to die as much as how to live” and “a celebration of everything that can make up a life, and how to hold it all close when everything feels completely precarious”. “I’d be lying if I said that the last decade hasn’t been the best of my life,” Hughes wrote in the Observer in 2019 in a piece about her diagnosis. “I’ve been lucky in love, fulfilled in my work, surrounded by friends, laughed more than I ever thought possible at the most ridiculous of things. I can say with absolute honesty that I have had a lovely time and I don’t regret any of it.” Later, during the pandemic, she advised that “even in these depressing times try to find some part of the day that is worth relishing, whether it is a moment of beauty half-glimpsed outside, the joy found in escaping into a different world on page or screen, or the pleasure of dressing up for yourself and no one else because it makes you feel fine”. Hughes started out in journalism writing about basketball and college football for the New York Daily News. On her return to the UK, she covered horse racing and football, going on to write for papers including the Independent, Telegraph and Metro, as well as the Guardian and Observer. Her reports on abuses by UN peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with the photojournalist Kate Holt saw her shortlisted for an Amnesty International award in 2004. Her memoir will also include contributions from her friends. When Hughes died, tributes poured in from names ranging from Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner to Jed Mercurio, the television writer and creator of Line of Duty, and the screenwriter and television producer Sarah Phelps. “She was endlessly curious, hilarious and kind, an incisively brilliant and fearless writer,” said Phelps at the time. “Sarah was a guiding light for so many, in so many different ways,” said Blink editorial director Susannah Otter, who acquired the memoir. “She really knew what it was to live, fully and completely, with commitment, honesty and joy. It is a huge pleasure, and a colossal honour, to be publishing this luminously funny, honest collection from her with contributions from those who knew her best.”",Arts/Books,Memoir by the late journalist Sarah Hughes to be published in March 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/13/memoir-by-the-late-journalist-sarah-hughes-to-be-published-in-march-2022
12/13/2021,"The White House has been accused of cutting the video feed of a Taiwanese minister after a map in the official’s slide presentation showed the island in a different colour to China’s during last week’s Summit for Democracy, in an effort to avoid antagonising Beijing. Reuters news agency reported that during a panel discussion on Friday, the video feed showing Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s digital minister, was replaced with audio only.  The map used in Tang’s presentation is produced by South African NGO Civicus, which ranks the world by openness on civil rights. In it, Taiwan is labelled in green, making it the only regional entity described as “open”, while all the others, including several US allies and partners who were also participants in Biden’s summit, were shown as being “closed”, “repressed”, “obstructed” or “narrowed”. China, Laos, Vietnam and North Korea were coloured red and labelled “closed”. According to people familiar with Friday’s event who spoke to Reuters, the map led officials at the White House National Security Council to express concern. The NSC was also upset as the slide had not appeared in dry-run versions of the presentation before the summit, according to the report. When the moderator for Tang’s session returned to her, there was no video of her. An on-screen disclaimer later clarified: “Any opinions expressed by individuals on this panel are those of the individual, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United States government,” according to the report. The alleged incident came at a highly sensitive time in Washington’s fraught relationship with Beijing, which sees Taiwan as its breakaway province. Last month, Xi Jinping told Joe Biden that any support for Taiwanese independence would be “like playing with fire” and that “those who play with fire will get burned”. The way the administration handled the alleged incident also highlighted Biden’s blanching act in dealing with Taiwan. While helping the democratically run island expand its international space, Washington does not wish to be seen as breaking its decades-long policy of “strategic ambiguity” when dealing with Taiwan. Critics say that this incident was the administration’s “overreaction”, and it cast doubt on Biden’s repeated commitment in public that his administration’s support for Taiwan was “rock solid”. “[But] the bigger picture is that Taiwan is a crucial member of the US’s international democratic coalition at a time of stiff competition with China and Russia,” said George Yin, a research fellow at National Taiwan University’s Centre for China Studies. “Nonetheless, the US also has a strong interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan strait given the troubles surrounding Ukraine.” Tang’s map caused consternation among US officials, the report said, but the State Department insisted the incident was “an honest mistake”. It said confusion over screen-sharing resulted in her video feed being dropped. “We valued minister Tang’s participation, which showcased Taiwan’s world-class expertise on issues of transparent governance, human rights and countering disinformation,” a State Department spokesperson said. The NSC also disputed this account, saying the report was inaccurate and blamed it on confusion over screen-sharing. Taiwan’s foreign ministry also blamed technical problems for the incident after it was revealed. “Taiwan and the United States have fully communicated on this technical issue, and the two sides have a solid mutual trust and a solid and friendly relationship,” it said.",News/World news,US appears to cut video feed of Taiwanese minister at summit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/us-appears-to-cut-video-feed-audrey-tang-taiwan-summit-for-democracy
12/13/2021,"Grieving pupils at a primary school in east London are “struggling to cope” after one of their brightest and best-loved classmates was killed over the weekend in an incident being linked to pest control chemicals found in the flats where she lived. Rena Begum, the headteacher of Buttercup primary in Shadwell said the school was in “great shock” following the death of 11-year-old Fatiha Sabrin in Saturday’s incident.  The Metropolitan police were treating her death as unexplained before further tests and a postmortem could be carried out. In a statement it said: “A sweep of the building was carried out by the London fire brigade and a quantity of chemicals – believed to be used for pest control – were discovered. They will be safely removed and an investigation will be carried out to determine how they came to be in the building.” Begum said Fatiha was a school “role model”, who planned to become a doctor and whose written work had just been selected for a national award. After announcing Fatiha’s death to her classmates on Monday, Begum said: “The children are struggling to cope. It is a real shock to them at their young age that suddenly someone is not there. It took them half an hour to take it in, and then everybody started crying and there were tissues everywhere.” Fatiha’s mother, Kanji Fatema, was recovering in hospital after also inhaling toxic fumes at the flat at Nida House in Shadwell. Her seven-year-old brother was back at school after being released from hospital. Begum said: “A family friend went to the flat and found two bodies unresponsive. I got a call on the school emergency mobile, was told they were taken to hospital and that Fatiha had been pronounced dead and that the block had been evacuated.” The children’s father was reported to be flying back from Bangladesh, while emergency accommodation was being found for the family. Begum said “we are doing our best to support the family” and described Fatiha as an “amazing student”. She said: “Every week when someone gets a gold award or star of the week, we write their name down. Her name is still there on the wall. “She was a brilliant writer, and we hope a book will be published soon including her short stories. She just got selected for a national literacy award for young writers.” Begum added: “She had strong dreams of wanting to help the community and becoming a medical professional. Her friends are devastated by her empty seat in class. There was a lot of confusion and tears, it was important for them to just let it out. We are giving them bereavement counselling. “She was a very popular member of the class and always willing to help others when they didn’t understand something. She was one of those students who never had to come to the headteacher’s office. She was a happy and bubbly person.” Fatiha’s class had been due to visit the Imperial War Museum on Monday as part of a project about the first world war. Begum said Fatiha’s family encouraged her to excel. She said: “They are a very supportive family and very ambitious for her. She just did an 11-plus exam to enter a grammar school and not many do that. She knew what she wanted to do in life and her family wanted the best for both of their children.” ",News/UK news,"East London school pays tribute to girl, 11, killed in incident linked to chemicals",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/13/girl-fatiha-sabrin-11-dies-in-incident-linked-to-pest-control-chemicals-in-east-london
12/13/2021,"Mary was always a wonderful person, with such a beautiful spirit. I’d known her since we were young growing up in Detroit. She’d always be singing and dancing with her friends in the projects, and we used to rehearse in the same building. Then [when she was 15, in 1959] she became a member of the Primettes, who changed their name to the Supremes a year later, the same year that I became one of the Temptations. Our careers went in parallel in many aspects, and that bonded us as friends. Our bands were known together as Motown’s no-hit wonders – neither of us had a hit until late 1963, early 1964, which was hard. But Mary had a lot of determination. She’d throw everything into her performances. We’d sing in nightclubs together and I’d watch her from the side of the stage, notice how hard she was working. She had that great smoky, sultry voice even when she was a teenager, this silky attitude and swagger. She was a real fashionista too. She loved dressing up and she was always as cute as a button.  She was so proud when the band started having big hits around the world, like Where Did Our Love Go and Baby Love [in 1964], then things started happening for us too [the Temptations’ first big hit, My Girl, was No 1 in January 1965]. I remember Mary buying a nice duplex on the west side of Detroit and she was so excited to decorate it and buy things for it. Things like that meant so much to kids like us. Our bands recorded a single together, I’m Going to Make You Love Me [in 1968], and did a big television special – she was such a standout on that. As times went on [Diana Ross left the Supremes in 1970 to go solo], Mary was so determined to keep the band strong. She also fought to keep the Supremes’ name, which I learned a lot from. [Wilson helped draft the Truth in Music bill in the late 1990s, protecting the trademark of a band name for original members, which is now law in 35 out of 50 US states; Williams owns the rights to the Temptations’ name.] And then she wrote her memoir, Dreamgirl, which was a huge success. It sold so well, and I think it was very inspirational and innovative in a lot of respects, like when she’s talking about the ways that life doesn’t always play out the way we want it to [she writes about the decline and early death of her friend and Supremes bandmate Florence Ballard]. Mary had a lot to deal with in her later life too, like when she lost her son [Rafael, in a car crash, when he was 14], but she never lost that spirit. She kept in touch all the time over the years, sending letters and cards and calling. We were last in touch a few weeks before I heard she had gone. She told me she was in the process of doing her new album – we were both still making music – and she said to me: “I’m still your Mary.” It was so out of the blue when she passed. I found out on Facebook that morning, and then I called around people I knew. I just couldn’t believe it. It made me think how Motown came along almost by happenstance, and how lucky we were to be part of something so historic and well loved. I know she loved being part of it too, singing those songs that will outlive us all.",Arts/Music,Those we lost in 2021: Mary Wilson remembered by Otis Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/13/obituaries-2021-mary-wilson-remembered-by-otis-williams
12/13/2021,"Is there name yet for the genre of stories in which a character goes through multiple realities, made magically accessible without any proper science-fiction explanation, in order to learn some kind of life lesson? Let’s call them mystical multiverse tales. It’s a particularly popular plot mechanism in movies these days, although you can trace it back to Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol and then on through Frank Capra’s film It’s a Wonderful Life, Groundhog Day, Sliding Doors and beyond. This British comedy-drama is squarely embedded in the mystical multiverse tradition, with its flawed but essentially likable central character – in this case Michael Sheen’s Nottingham-bred wideboy Tony Towers, who discovers one Christmas Eve that he can experience the forking paths his life might have taken by shifting from one carriage to another on a homeward-bound train. The story starts in 1985, when Tony is a fortysomething nightclub owner with a massive Peter Stringfellow-style blond mullet. He’s accompanied on the trip back to see his elderly parents by his nice girlfriend Sue (Nathalie Emmanuel) and his younger brother Roger (Cary Elwes under serious ginger wigs), who is less successful than Tony but is at least happily married to Astrid (Anna Lundberg).  But when Tony moves into the next carriage, suddenly his clothes, and hairstyle change and he no longer has his train ticket in his wallet. He makes small decisions, like to open one club rather than six and to give Roger a bigger share of the joint business; when he moves to another train carriage everything changes again. Sometimes we go deep into the past and see the characters played by younger actors and learn about the childhood traumas and events that shaped them. By the end we catch up with Tony in our present day, older and presumably wiser. It’s a pretty high concept posited by writer-director Julian Kemp, made even weirder by the way Sheen’s Tony just sort of rolls with it all, swiftly working out how to tinker with his futures in order to either benefit himself or save loved ones from ruin. But Sheen is an engaging enough actor to pull it off, gurning and goofing around to keep from being upstaged by the procession of well-observed, period-accurate but ridiculously over-the-top costumes, from the Tony Wilson-style sharp-suit-no-tie-fully-buttoned-shirt look, to a blazer the colour of candy floss. And then, by slow degrees, he brings a tender sort of sadness to the story, full of wistful regrets and zen resignation to the contingencies of fate. Props are also due to the production design team, who sourced all the different moquette upholstery fabrics for the train seats that mark the different eras as the story develops.  Last Train to Christmas is available on 18 December on Sky Cinema and NOW.",Arts/Film,Last Train to Christmas – Michael Sheen adds gloss to mystical Sliding Doors-style comedy,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/13/last-train-to-christmas-review-michael-sheen
12/13/2021,"Fears that Turkey is on course for a full-scale financial crisis have intensified after the lira plunged to fresh lows against the US dollar. Turkey’s central bank was forced to step in to defend the ailing currency – selling US dollars for lira – after the latest sharp selloff.  The lira was at one stage trading at almost 15 to the dollar as currency dealers contemplated the prospect of the latest in a series of interest rates cuts demanded of the central bank by the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Erdoğan’s insistence that the central bank should keep reducing the cost of borrowing despite annual inflation running at 20% has led to the value of the lira halving during 2021. Official interest rates have been cut from 19% to 15% since September and markets are bracing themselves for another 1-point cut in interest rates on Thursday. Erdoğan was expected to hold talks with the central bank governor, Şahap Kavcıoğlu, the finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, and the heads of state banks in Istanbul on Monday, and some analysts said a crashing lira and the threat of a credit downgrade from the rating agency S&P might force the government to adopt a more cautious approach. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: “Honestly I don’t think they can carry out another 1 percentage point cut this week. The lira has been very volatile for the past few weeks, and S&P has downgraded to a negative outlook. The markets will have very little tolerance to such a move.” At one stage, the lira had fallen 7% against the dollar before mounting a partial recovery to about 14.25 to the dollar on the currency-market intervention by the central bank. Analysts warned, however, that buying lira in the financial markets was likely to provide only a temporary respite. “Last week’s apparent relative stability of the Turkish lira was artificial and non-sustainable. Now we see the buildup pressure unfolding, driving lira weakness to the next level,” Commerzbank said in a note. “Any further attempts of the central bank to stabilise the lira by interventions is probably bound to fail.”",News/World news,Turkey faces threat of financial crisis after lira plunges against dollar,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/turkey-faces-threat-of-financial-crisis-after-lira-plunges-against-dollar
12/13/2021,"Large parts of Afghanistan’s health system are on the brink of collapse because of western sanctions against the Taliban, international experts have warned, as the country faces outbreaks of disease and an escalating malnutrition crisis. With the country experiencing a deepening humanitarian crisis since the Taliban’s seizure of power in August amid mounting levels of famine and economic collapse, many medical staff have not been paid for months and health facilities lack even the most basic items to treat patients.  Dr Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian health at Johns Hopkins University, said that on a recent five-week trip to the country he had seen public hospitals – which cater for the most vulnerable – lacking fuel, drugs, hygiene products and even basic items such as colostomy bags. He said the Covid-19 responsehad almost ground to a halt and called for a more nuanced response to western sanctions in order to avert a deeper public health disaster. “It’s really bad and it is going to get a lot worse,” Spiegel, a former chief of public health at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees among other high-profile humanitarian assignments, told the Guardian. “There are six simultaneous disease outbreaks: cholera, a massive measles outbreak, polio, malaria and dengue fever, and that is in addition to the coronavirus pandemic.” Some parts of the primary healthcare system were being funded through a two-decades-old scheme, Spiegel said, but large parts remained largely unsupported, even as health officials, international organisations and NGOs have been required to restart programmes on hold after the Taliban regained control of the country in August. “I’ve been everywhere during my career. What is shocking is that you don’t normally have an abrupt halt to everything. The UN organisations and NGOs supporting healthcare in Afghanistan are not just dealing with acute emergencies, they’re having to respond to getting the basics running. “For example, there are supposed to be 39 hospitals dealing with Covid-19 cases of which 7.7% is fully functioning. And it’s not just the hospitals. It’s the whole thing that glues together public health systems: surveillance systems, testing and there’s very little oxygen to treat those who do have Covid.” He described the main referral hospital for infectious diseases in Kabul as “on its knees”. “None of the staff have received salaries for months, though most are still coming in. There is hardly any medicine and they are cutting tress in the courtyard to heat the rooms because there is no gas. They’ve also sent their ventilators to the Afghan Japan hospital to treat Covid cases but that is also struggling.” His comments reflected mounting concern over the collapse of healthcare across Afghanistan, a country of 23 million people. Exacerbating the issue is that Afghanistan’s economic issues, with the IMF warning of a contraction of some 30%, have plunged ever more people into poverty, which has had a knock-on effect for those needing healthcare but unable to afford to seek it. Outside of Kabul and other major cities, Spiegel said the situation was even worse. “There is a provincial hospital in Sarobi outside Kabul I visited. There was insufficient water and soap for hygiene protocols,” he said. “There was a small child who had been born at the hospital with an anal fistula. She was so sick that they had put a colostomy in but they had no bags and so they were using whatever material find – like toilet paper – to collect from the colostomy.” Dave Michalski, head of programme at Doctors Without Borders in Afghanistan, last week warned in an interview with NPR that there likely to be Afghans in need of healthcare who were not able to access even the reduced levels available. “How many people are being blocked [from seeking healthcare],” he asked. “How many people are not taking the bus to the next province to find healthcare that is working because their own provincial health care system is closed or because there are no drugs on the shelves. “And if you don’t have the money to travel around to find a private health care facility … and many private health care facilities are also in trouble because of supply lines.” The UN children’s organisation Unicef has warned that the growing crisis in the country’s health system is exacerbating Afghanistan’s mounting malnutrition issues. “The current humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is dire, especially for children. Winter has already set in and, without additional funding, Unicef and partners will be unable to reach the children and families that need us the most,” said Alice Akunga, Unicef’s Afghanistan representative. “As families struggle to put nutritious food on the table and health systems are further strained, millions of Afghan children are at risk of starvation and death. Others struggle to access water and sanitation, are cut off from their schools and at heightened risk of violence.” Spiegel said the west needed to find a different approach to the imposition of sanctions on the Taliban: “There needs to be much more nuanced way of implementing sanctions than using such a blunt instrument [as they are currently configured],” he said. “While understanding concerns about the Taliban … the reality is that a lot of people will die because of them.”",News/Global development,Afghan health system ‘close to collapse due to sanctions on Taliban’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/13/afghan-health-system-close-to-collapse-due-to-sanctions-on-taliban
12/13/2021,"The vacuum cleaner maker Dyson has told many of its UK employees to continue working in the office, claiming that large portions of its business are impossible to carry out from home. Dyson’s billionaire owner, Sir James Dyson, has consistently opposed working from home and the company has stuck to that line despite the rise of the Omicron coronavirus variant, stoking concern among some employees.  All Dyson offices should remain open, according to an internal message sent to all UK staff last week after the prime minister announced the new plan B guidance advising work from home. In contrast to lockdowns earlier in the pandemic, the guidance does not legally oblige companies to allow staff to work from home, but Boris Johnson said last Wednesday that people should work from home where possible as a precaution against Omicron, although he also said people should continue to attend work Christmas parties. Dyson, however, said in the message to staff that “we fundamentally disagree” with Johnson on that issue, cancelling its own Christmas party in favour of a summer family event, and recommending that its workers avoid parties and events over Christmas where masks are not worn “to keep safe and protect your friends and family over Christmas”. Employees at Dyson have expressed frustration with its policy on working in the office. One worker, who declined to be named, told the Guardian: “Since the summer everyone in the UK has been mandated to work five days a week in the office. It is as draconian as it sounds.” The worker said the policy went against the spirit of the new government guidance. A wave of large office employers have told workers to remain at home, although some will keep offices open for business-critical functions or exceptional reasons such as for workers with mental health issues. The magazine publisher Future on Friday reversed its demand for staff to come into the office after its stance was revealed by the Guardian. Dyson’s Brexiter founder has been a vocal opponent of working from home. In an interview with the Times in September 2020, he said: “Working from home doesn’t work. I only did it when I couldn’t afford an office or employees. People need to interact and exchange views.” Dyson workers expected to work from the office include teams in research, IT, security, development, commercial and estates management, among other departments – a list that is thought to include large numbers of its UK workers. Dyson claims that the sensitive commercial nature of its work and the need to collaborate means office working is required. While Dyson makes most of its products overseas and controversially moved its headquarters to Singapore in early 2019, it does most of its research, development and design of products including vacuums, fans and dryers in the UK. It is understood that James Dyson has continued to work from the main UK campus in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in recent weeks. There are some limited exceptions to Dyson’s UK office mandate. Workers in the office of the chief executive, financial, legal, communications and human resources teams, among other departments, will be allowed to work from home in some cases, but they may be “required to work from the campus” if they need to “collaborate with others”, as well as for other reasons such as accessing equipment, according to the internal message. Dyson will also honour previously agreed exemptions to working in the office for workers in other departments. Employees have expressed concerns to the Guardian about Dyson’s strict line on office working on several occasions during the pandemic, including during separate lockdowns in May and November 2020. Dyson previously said it complied with all government guidance and that its employees’ health and safety is its top priority throughout the pandemic. It has also said that its safe-working practices go beyond the government’s requirements. A Dyson spokesperson said: “The latest government guidance states that employees ‘should continue to go into work’ if they need to access equipment or complete their role in person. Dyson is asking select groups to continue attending our campuses for practical, confidentiality and security reasons; and others may work at home. “We have gone beyond the government’s guidance throughout the crisis to keep our people safe – introducing mandatory mask-wearing long before the guidance required it, and these measures have remained in force since.” The spokesperson added that Dyson has donated £1m to Race Against Dementia in lieu of spending on its Christmas party.",News/Technology,Dyson tells many of UK staff to work in office even after plan B guidance change,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/13/dyson-tells-many-of-uk-staff-to-work-in-office-even-after-plan-b-guidance-change
12/13/2021,"Dusan Vlahovic finished off a weekend’s work by playing Father Christmas. He had already delivered two goals for Fiorentina on Saturday, helping them to a 4-0 win over Salernitana at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, but while his teammates went to celebrate under the Curva Fiesole he took himself to the stand behind the opposition bench. A young fan had prepared a sign asking for the striker’s shirt. It was enough to get on Santa’s “nice” list. Privately, Vlahovic might have been happy for the excuse. His relationship with the Ultras who occupy the Fiesole has not recovered since the club’s owner, Rocco Commisso, went public about the breakdown of his contract negotiations in October. Vlahovic, whose deal is set to expire in the summer of 2023, turned down an extension that would have made him Fiorentina’s best-paid player of all time.  He was worthy of such an offer. Vlahovic is Serie A’s top scorer this season with 15 goals from 17 appearances. He has struck 32 times in this calendar year, placing him just one shy of the league record held by Cristiano Ronaldo. Across Europe’s “big five” domestic championships, only Robert Lewandowski has outgunned Vlahovic in 2021. All this at 21 years old and playing for a club that finished 13th last season. Vlahovic is not a one-man army, and Fiorentina have made real strides in this campaign under their new manager, Vincenzo Italiano, rising all the way to fifth in the table. Yet the Serbian is still responsible for 48% of the club’s goals so far – and that’s before we start counting assists. Commisso was reported to have offered as much as €4m a year after tax – five times Vlahovic’s current pay rate. In a statement, he claimed to have raised his offer repeatedly to accommodate the player’s representatives. The player gave no public comment, but the suspicion was that no amount of money could persuade him to tie himself down at a time when he knew bigger clubs were starting to show an interest. Newspapers were linking him already with Juventus, provoking a grim sense of deja vu for Fiorentina fans. They had lost Federico Chiesa and Federico Bernardeschi to the Bianconeri in the past four years, just as they did Roberto Baggio three decades before. When your most promising young talent so often leaves to join your most hated rival, you can start to develop a complex. Vlahovic heard whistles from the Fiesole before Fiorentina’s next home game, a 3-0 rout of Cagliari. When the Viola won a penalty at that end of the pitch, he declined to take it – passing duties to the club’s captain, Cristiano Biraghi. Italiano would later insist that this was not a big deal and that penalties were a question of “feeling”. But the surprise was evident in the moment on the faces of Vlahovic’s teammates. He would score a free-kick at the far end later in the match, but while the rest of the Franchi celebrated a section of the Fiesole refused to join in. They did not jeer, but responded with performative indifference, extending a rehearsed chant without missing a beat. That has been the tone of things since. While most Fiorentina fans have shown themselves willing to get behind Vlahovic, a small and unyielding core of Ultras has resisted, making it clear that they would prefer him not to celebrate at their end. Meanwhile, the player’s form has only got better. Vlahovic followed up the Cagliari game with a hat-trick against Spezia, then two more goals and an assist in a 4-3 win over Milan. Then he went away on international duty and helped Serbia to qualify for the World Cup. Since returning, he has scored seven more goals in five games. ✨ 31 gol nel 2021 ✨ @acffiorentina @vlahovicdusan9 pic.twitter.com/kQ1wzUWu26 Such extraordinary form will only sharpen the interest of potential suitors. Arsenal and Manchester City were among the teams linked to the player last summer but at this point just about every leading club in Europe is at least monitoring his progress. With 18 months left on the player’s contract, Fiorentina could face a complicated decision if any of them decides to come forward with a worthy offer in January. Yet all indications are that the player himself would prefer to stay until the end of the campaign. Any longer than that is unlikely, even after he celebrated scoring against Milan by pointing a finger down at the pitch as if to say: “My place is here.” Vlahovic has spoken openly about ambition, about wanting to keep progressing and challenging himself. As he put it in an interview with Dazn this September, “a life without risk is not worth living”. Yet he believes Fiorentina is the right place for him to be at this moment, describing it as somewhere he can, “take a step forward, score lots of goals, give lots of assists and win lots of matches. The rest will come as it comes.” And Fiorentina are flying right now, with four wins – and 15 goals scored – in their last five games. Italiano earned his opportunity at the club by overachieving at Arzignano Valchiampo in Serie D, Trapani in Serie C and then Spezia in Serie B, securing repeat promotions before guiding the latter club to top-flight safety last season. He is popular with his players and was cited by Vlahovic as a key factor in the decision to stay this season in Florence. “He is always on you, correcting the smallest mistake,” said the striker. “I like that because with someone like that I can only grow.” ✨ ̷3̷1̷ ̷g̷o̷l̷ ̷ 32 gol nel 2021 ✨@acffiorentina @vlahovicdusan9 pic.twitter.com/rpb36Z846z Of the two goals Vlahovic scored on Saturday, the first was more eye-catching: an angled chip back across his own body from the edge of the box. It was the second, though, that he enjoyed more, arriving at the near post to sweep home a cross from Riccardo Sottil. He had been working with his manager to get better at those exact runs for weeks now. The pair celebrated together in front of the dugout. This was a satisfying evening all-around for Italiano, who has wanted more goals from midfield as well and had them delivered here by Giacomo Bonaventura and the substitute Youssef Maleh. It was the second strike in as many games for the latter player, 23 years old and signed from Venezia in January but allowed to stay on loan there until the summer. There is more to like in this squad than just Vlahovic. Maleh’s emergence is an encouraging note, as are the strong recent performances of Bonaventura and the Argentinian winger Nico González. Together they have helped to propel Fiorentina to fifth in the table, two points clear now even of Juventus. Vlahovic will eventually leave – whether sooner or later – but the club has a window of opportunity now to exploit his talent. It is not Father Christmas’s job, after all, to hang around forever. What better gift could there be, though, for those sceptics in the Curva Fiesole, than a European qualification earned at the expense of those most hated rivals?

12/13/2021,"Passenger numbers on London Underground were down almost 20% in the morning peak on Monday as some – but far from all – took government advice to work from home. Almost exactly 1m entries or exits to Britain’s busiest public transport network were recorded before 10am, about 220,000 fewer than the previous Monday, as the official guidance to work from home where possible came into effect.  Around 30% fewer people than last Monday also tapped in on Manchester’s Metrolink tram system, according to Transport for Greater Manchester, following the measures announced last week by Boris Johnson to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. Bus travel in London was down less sharply, with 6% fewer passengers on board before 10am. Tube usage started to fall back in the second half of last week following the plan B announcement on Monday, with passenger numbers down between 3% and 5% on the previous week’s mornings. The morning rush hour has now fallen back to below half of pre-pandemic levels, at 46% of normal. However, a greater proportion of people are now using Transport for London’s services later in the day, for work and leisure, possibly attending still-permitted Christmas parties and shopping. The reduction in passengers will further hit TfL’s battered finances. On Monday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, confirmed to the Commons a week-long extension to the government’s financial support for the capital, after talks over longer-term funding failed to reach agreement before the weekend deadline. Shapps said the decision would provide “continued support to and certainty to Londoners while we work with TfL on their funding needs”. Data was not yet available on national rail travel. Provisional figures from the start of December suggested weekday travel has started to decline from a 2021 peak of just over 70% of normal levels, although weather-related delays as well as fears over renewed Covid transmission were a factor.",News/Business,London bus and tube use falls as work-from-home advice updated,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/london-bus-and-tube-use-falls-as-work-from-home-advice-updated
12/13/2021,"NHS trusts are facing calls to suspend the use of a monitoring system that continuously records video of mental health patients in their bedrooms amid concerns that it breaches their human rights. Mental health charities said the Oxevision system, used by 23 NHS trusts in some psychiatric wards to monitor patients’ vital signs, could breach their right to privacy and exacerbate their distress.  The call comes after Camden and Islington NHS foundation trust (C&I) suspended its use of Oxevision after a formal complaint by a female patient who said the system amounted to “covert surveillance”. The Oxevision system allows staff to monitor a patient’s pulse and breathing rate via an optical sensor, which consists of a camera and an infrared illuminator to allow night-time observation. It includes a live video feed of the patient, which is recorded and kept for 24-72 hours, depending on the NHS trust, before being deleted. Oxehealth, which created the system, said it was not like CCTV because staff could only view the video feed for about 10-15 seconds during a vital signs check or in response to a safety incident. The system, which is also installed at Exeter police station custody suite and an Oxfordshire care home, can alert staff if someone else has unexpectedly entered a patient’s room or if they are in a blindspot, such as the bathroom, for too long. Alexa Knight, associate director of policy and practice at Rethink Mental Illness, said: “While we appreciate that the motivation for putting surveillance cameras in people’s bedrooms stems from the need to protect them, to do so without clear consent is unjustifiable and this pilot should be suspended immediately.” Camden Borough User Group and other service users have raised concerns with C&I that patient consent was not being consistently obtained. The trust’s patient information leaflet about Oxevision states that rooms are monitored by an optical sensor but does not mention that patients are being recorded. A spokesperson for C&I said the trust acknowledged that patient consent for Oxevision needed to be tightened, including the option to opt out of the system. “While the [patient] leaflet advises that the system monitors service users 24/7, we are not confident that the video element was always made clear,” she said, adding that the trust was conducting a review into whether to resume using the technology. Rheian Davies, head of legal advocacy at mental health charity Mind, said: “Being videoed without consent in your own room is a dreadful thought and could add to the distress someone is already feeling.” Davies, a former psychiatric nurse, said: “We urge any mental health trusts considering trialling, or trialling, this technology with their patients without consent, to pause and reconsider, because of the legal, ethical, and clinical questions it raises. “Even if you are detained under the Mental Health Act you do not lose all your legal rights … and blanket use of surveillance raises issues of privacy, which is protected under the Human Rights Act.” Of the 17 other NHS trusts that Oxehealth said it could disclose as piloting the system, another five revealed patient leaflets with similar descriptions to C&I’s: Derbyshire Healthcare NHS foundation trust, Midlands Partnership NHS foundation trust, Pennine Care NHS foundation trust, Rotherham Doncaster and South Humber NHS foundation trust (RDaSH), and West London NHS trust. All five trusts said patients were informed by staff about how Oxevision works, and RDaSH added that its leaflet was under review. Leaflets provided by three trusts – Central and North West London NHS foundation trust, Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS foundation trust and Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS foundation trust – explicitly mention that Oxevision incorporates a camera or records video footage. Several other trusts did not clarify whether their leaflets did so but said patients were informed about the system. Mary Sadid, policy officer at mental health charity the National Survivor User Network, said: “Oxevision is playing out in some settings as blanket surveillance with questionable attempts at informed consent. “The Care Quality Commission does not authorise the use of ‘covert intrusive surveillance’. What we have heard about Oxevision so far, including possible breaches of right to privacy, points to a potential need for an investigation by the regulator. The suspension of blanket surveillance and surveillance without consent should be an immediate priority.” Oxehealth’s own research, with up to 78 patients from five mental health trusts, found that 80% agreed the system provided a better sense of safety and two thirds agreed it provided a greater sense of privacy. A spokesman said: “We take patients’ privacy rights very seriously and Oxevision is fully compliant with all the laws that apply to it. It is a service that is only used where necessary and it is only used for patient benefit. Oxevision offers significant patient safety benefits and allows clinicians to measure pulse and breathing rate without disturbing the patient.” Lily, not her real name, who has schizotypal disorder and autism, became acutely distressed after discovering that she was being recorded by Oxevision at Camden and Islington NHS foundation trust. The 26-year-old was admitted to the Rosewood Unit, based at St Pancras Hospital, which is dedicated to treating the trust’s most vulnerable female psychiatric patients, in mid-July, after she “became incredibly unwell and a danger to myself”. “A nurse came into my room while I was using the toilet and said: ‘Oh you’re in the bathroom, I couldn’t see you on the camera.’ When I asked what camera she meant, she claimed she misspoke. I was later made aware of a poster and leaflet that had been placed next to the nurse’s station but neither of these mention a camera. “It was a few more days before a nurse showed me the monitor they have in the office. It fed into my delusion that staff were intentionally keeping patients unwell … I tried to cover the cameras but staff stopped me, and I became so distressed that the response team was called. They nearly injected me. “Staff still told some patients that Oxevision only took their blood pressure and heart rate, and denied the existence of the cameras. So a lot of patients thought that I was having psychotic delusions. “To be under surveillance 24 hours a day is incredibly distressing and dehumanising. It is a violation of privacy and dignity. This constant monitoring can make people who struggle with paranoia or psychosis even more unwell. “I rely on staff to tell me if a thought is rational or delusional. I can no longer trust them to do this. I told the staff that the system was unethical and required consent.”",News/Society,NHS trusts criticised over system that films mental health patients in their bedrooms,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/13/nhs-trusts-urged-to-ditch-oxevision-system-covert-surveillance-mental-health-patients
12/13/2021,"The UK competition regulator has opened an investigation into Microsoft’s proposed $16bn takeover of Nuance, the artificial intelligence and speech recognition firm best known for its work on Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, in its latest move to scrutinise the impact of deals struck by big tech. The move by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) comes weeks after it ordered Facebook parent company Meta to sell the gif creation website Giphy, the first time the regulator has moved to block a deal struck by a major Silicon Valley company.  Microsoft moved to buyMassachusetts-based Nuance, which has a stock market value of almost $18bn, in April to build up its cloud computing operation for healthcare and business customers. Nuance says that it works with more than three-quarters of US hospitals, and has also been used by the NHS in the UK, with the deal the second-largest in Microsoft’s history after the $26.2bn acquisition of LinkedIn five years ago. “The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation,” said the regulator. “And, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods and services.” The CMA said it is inviting comments from interested parties and rivals as it assesses whether the deal warrants an in-depth investigation. The deal has already been unconditionally cleared by regulators in the US and Australia. The European Commission has also been taking soundings from rivals, with a decision on whether to investigate expected as soon as this week. The commission is expected to clear the deal. Nuance offers healthcare businesses and hospitals services including medical transcription, clinical speech recognition and medical imaging. Its technology has paid off during the pandemic as it cuts down on note taking, helping doctors and nurses reduce their exposure to coronavirus. Microsoft has been in preliminary talks with the CMA, which now has 40 days to decide whether to launch an in-depth investigation, ahead of the formal request for approval of the deal.  Facebook has said it disagrees with the CMA’s decision ordering it to sell Giphy, which it acquired for $400m last year, and is considering an appeal. The CMA is set to be given beefed up powers to investigate deals struck by Silicon Valley companies through a new dedicated digital markets unit, which also includes a new enforceable code of conduct in dealings with third parties such as publishers based on “fair trading and trust and transparency”. The government is yet to officially grant the DMU powers which requires parliamentary time for new legislation.",News/Business,UK regulator to look at Microsoft takeover bid for AI firm Nuance,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/uk-regulator-to-look-at-microsoft-takeover-bid-for-ai-firm-nuance
