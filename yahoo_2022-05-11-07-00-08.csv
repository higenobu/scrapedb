5/11/2022,"An Oklahoma man was arrested after hundreds of images of child pornography were found on a phone that belonged to him — but it was all part of a scheme hatched by his wife, investigators say. The wife, 33-year-old Lacey Hucks, and her friend Angel Moore, 44, are accused of working together to frame the husband, according to arrest affidavits. Investigators believe Hucks’ plan centered around gaining custody of their kids. “It had to do with her getting her children back,” Garvin County Sheriff Jim Mullett told McClatchy News. “If they could get him out of the picture, then she thought she would get her children back.” On April 18, Hucks drove her accomplice, Moore, to the Wynnewood Police Department, gave her the incriminating phone, and asked her to make a report, according to an affidavit filed May 2. Moore turned over the device, telling police she had seen Hucks’ husband using it to look at child porn at his Garvin County home. The phone was handed over to Garvin County deputies. On it, they found hundreds of images of “various juvenile female victims,” documents say. Hucks’ husband was placed under arrest. But investigators became suspicious when the phone he had on him — his current phone — had no similar content as the one Moore gave them. Investigators got a warrant to search Hucks’ phone and discovered that she and Moore knew each other, and seemed to be friends. Phone records showed they had communicated about making the police report prior to April 18, an affidavit said. Moore had said previously that she did not know Hucks. But in an interview, she told a deputy that Hucks had encouraged her — even coached her — to deliver the false report against her husband. “(Moore) admitted that she was never at (the husband’s) residence and never observed him with the phone,” the affidavit said, but Hucks had described the home to her. “(Moore) stated that she thought she was doing the right thing for (Hucks).” Through further investigation, deputies learned that the images on the phone had been downloaded months earlier, in December, all within a few days, documents said, and they all appeared to be screenshots from the same website. The husband told police he hadn’t seen the supposedly incriminating phone since October or November, but “didn’t think too much of it because it was not his primary phone and did not have service.” Moore was arrested on charges of conspiracy and knowingly reporting a false crime, documents read. Hucks was arrested on the same charges, plus an additional charge of aggravated possession of child pornography. Mom let 47-year-old ‘marry’ her 13-year-old, TX officials say.

5/11/2022,"The S&P 500 is down 10% over the past month alone. According to CNBC’s Jim Cramer, the recent plunge in stocks reflects a lack of investor confidence in the Federal Reserve. He says these investors believe that the Fed has lost control or is helpless to fix things given the state of the global supply chain. But Cramer remains bullish — particularly on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. “I think the consumer is strong. Jobs are plentiful,” he says. “Leaving the market is a mistake because Powell happens to be an incredibly thoughtful, good public servant who’s doing amazing.” For bullish investors who share that sentiment, here are a few Cramer’s top recommendations. Chip giant AMD is starting to look like the baby that gets tossed out with the bathwater. The shares are down more than 40% in 2022 despite boasting a thriving underlying business. In Q1, AMD’s revenue was up 71% year over year to $5.9 billion. Some of that topline growth was driven by the acquisition of semiconductor company Xilinx. Eliminating the impact of that purchase still gives us top-line growth of 55%. That’s excellent for a stock that’s currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio in the high-teens. Nvidia is another chipmaker in Cramer’s “good basket.” While the stock has also plunged by more than 40% year to date, Nvidia’s outlook remains relatively bright. Nvidia is scheduled to report Q1 earnings later this month. Given the recent rout in the digital assets market, the report will likely reflect a plunge in crypto mining demand. But analysts still expect $8.09 billion in revenue and $1.29 in earnings per share. Nvidia could be an ideal target for investors looking for growth at reasonable prices. Picking the right stocks in a choppy market is difficult — particularly in the volatile tech sector. Instead of stock picking, investors can make a broad bet on the entire beaten-down space. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), for instance, offers exposure to the leading names in technology. The fund’s biggest holdings include Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE). VGT is down 23% in 2022. Cramer believes a rising interest rate environment is good for big banks. “They’re gonna make a lot more money off you,” he says. When rates increase, the spread between what banks charge in interest (to borrowers) and what they pay out (to savers) widens. Blue-chip bank stocks are a great option. But investors can also bet on the entire sector through an ETF. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) tracks the total return performance of the S&P Banks Select Industry Index — an index with an average price-to-book of 1.1. The ETF’s top holdings include banks like First Bancorp (FNLC), Northern Trust (NTRS) and M&T Bank (MTB). Investors worried about rising rates and inflated valuations in the tech sector might want to put KBE on their watch list.

5/11/2022,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Russia's ambassador to Poland was splattered with red paint thrown at him by protesters opposed to the war in Ukraine, preventing him from paying respects on Monday at a Warsaw cemetery to Red Army soldiers who died during World War II. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denounced the attack, saying that “we won’t be scared” while the “people of Europe should be scared to see their reflection in a mirror.” Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau described the incident as “highly deplorable.” “Diplomats enjoy special protection, regardless of the policies pursued by the governments that they represent,” he said. Ambassador Sergey Andreev arrived at the Soviet soldiers' cemetery to lay flowers on Victory Day, which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies. The major Russian patriotic holiday was celebrated with pomp in a parade at Red Square in Moscow. As he arrived at the Soviet Military Cemetery in the Polish capital, Andreev was met by hundreds of activists opposed to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Red paint was thrown from behind at him before a protester standing beside him threw a big blob of it in his face. The protesters carried Ukrainian flags and chanted ""fascists” and “murderers"" at him, in Russian, while some were dressed in white sheets smeared with red, symbolizing the Ukrainian victims of Russia’s war. Other people in his entourage were also seen splattered with what appeared to be red paint. Zakharova said that “admirers of the neo-Nazis have once again shown their face.” She said that along with the removal of monuments to Soviet army World War II heroes, the attack reflected the “course for the reincarnation of fascism.” Some Russian commentators suggested that the attack on the ambassador could prompt Moscow to recall him and ask the Polish ambassador to leave Russia. The Polish government faced some criticism for not providing the ambassador with more security, allowing for an incident to occur that Russia could use to depict Poland as hostile to Moscow. Among the critics was a former interior minister, Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, who said he couldn't understand why there wasn't more protection for the ambassador when for weeks “you could feel how May 9 could end in Warsaw.” Poland’s current interior minister, however, said Poland’s government opposed the ambassador against laying a wreath at the cemetery, and noted that police helped him to safely leave the scene. The ambassador had originally hoped to hold a Victory Day march in Warsaw, but national and city authorities opposed that — and some viewed his appearance at the cemetery as provocative. “The gathering of opponents of Russian aggression against Ukraine, where the crime of genocide takes place every day, was legal,” Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski added. “The emotions of Ukrainian women taking part in the demonstration, whose husbands are fighting bravely in defense of their homeland, are understandable.” Protesters also marched in Warsaw on Sunday evening to protest the war, bringing a tank on a tractor and parking it in front of the Russian Embassy. Since the war began on Feb. 24, images of Ukrainian tractors hauling off Russian tanks have been symbols of Ukrainian resistance. The Soviet cemetery is set amid a vast park on the route linking the downtown to the international airport. It is the final resting place of more than 20,000 Red Army soldiers who perished on Polish soil fighting while helping to defeat Nazi Germany. While Poland has removed some monuments to the Red Army in the decades since it threw off Moscow-backed communist rule, it has allowed the cemetery to remain undisturbed. Though Soviet soldiers defeated the Nazis, earlier in the war the Soviet forces had invaded Poland following a secret agreement with the German Nazi government, and carried out atrocities against Poles, including mass executions and deportations to Siberia. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,Russian envoy to Poland hit with red paint at war cemetery,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-ambassador-poland-hit-red-104938503.html
