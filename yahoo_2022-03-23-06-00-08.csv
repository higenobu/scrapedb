3/23/2022,"By Sabine Siebold and Robin Emmott ON BOARD THE SUPPLY SHIP ELBE, Latvia (Reuters) - Hours after Russian missiles first struck Ukrainian cities on Feb. 24, German naval commander Terje Schmitt-Eliassen received notice to sail five warships under his command to the former Soviet Republic of Latvia to help protect the most vulnerable part of NATO's eastern flank. The hasty dispatch was part of Germany's scramble to send ""everything that can swim out to sea,"" as the navy's top boss phrased it, to defend an area military strategists have long deemed the weakest point for the alliance. The vessels' sudden departure demonstrated how NATO, and Germany, were propelled by Russia's invasion into a new reality and face what officials, diplomats, intelligence officials and security sources agree is the most serious threat to the alliance's collective security since the Cold War. Schmitt-Eliassen, who is based in the German Baltic port of Kiel, spoke to Reuters on the flight deck of the supply ship Elbe. Moored next to it, within sight of the church towers of the Latvian capital Riga, were a Latvian and a Lithuanian ship, and vessels and sailors from nations including Denmark, Belgium and Estonia were due to join the group later. A total of 12 NATO warships with some 600 sailors on board are due to start a mine-clearing operation in the coming days. STORY: ""That would be even more dangerous, destructive and even more deadly. The situation could spiral out of control,"" Stoltenberg warned.Speaking alongside Latvia's President Egils Levits, Stoltenberg said Russia's invasion was causing horrific suffering and that the humanitarian impact was devastating.“We will protect and defend every inch of Latvia and we will protect and defend every inch of all allied territory,"" he added.The United Nations said the number of refugees who have fled Ukraine had surged past 2 million, describing the flight as one of the fastest exoduses in modern times.Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbor and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a baseless pretext for an invasion to conquer a country of 44 million people. On Feb. 16, when intelligence showed an invasion was imminent, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the current era a ""new normal."" It looks a lot like a return to the past. Founded in 1949 to defend against the Soviet threat, the NATO alliance is facing a return to mechanised warfare, a huge increase in defence spending, and potentially a new Iron Curtain falling across Europe. After struggling to find a new post-Cold War role, countering terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 and a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, NATO is back defending against its original nemesis. But there's a difference. China, which split with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, has refused to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" And the old Cold War blueprints no longer work, as NATO has expanded east since the 1990s, bringing in former Soviet states – including the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in 2004. In early February, China and Russia issued a powerful joint statement rejecting NATO's expansion in Europe and challenging the Western-led international order. Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia could touch off a global conflict. ""We have reached a turning point,"" said retired German general Hans-Lothar Domroese, who led one of the highest NATO commands in the Dutch town of Brunssum until 2016. ""We have China and Russia acting in concert now, boldly challenging the United States for global leadership ... In the past, we have been saying deterrence works. Now we have to ask ourselves: Is deterrence enough?"" This is underscored by Schmitt-Eliassen's mission – a regular exercise that was brought forward by Russia's invasion. The issue is access. Before the Soviet Union was dissolved, NATO could have moved to contain the Soviet Union by blocking the western entrance of the Baltic Sea. That would seal in the Soviet Union's Baltic Fleet to prevent it from reaching the North Sea where its warships could attack U.S. supply convoys. Today, NATO's and Russia's roles have been reversed: An emboldened Moscow could encircle NATO's new Baltic members, and cut them off from the alliance. If a new Iron Curtain is to fall, NATO needs to ensure its members are not behind it (see map https://tmsnrt.rs/3tnekaO). The three tiny countries, with a combined population of some six million people, have a single overland link to the alliance's main territory. A corridor of some 65 km (40 miles) is squeezed between the heavily armed Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the west and Belarus on the east. So Schmitt-Eliassen's goal is to keep the waterway open, as a supply line also for non-NATO states Finland and Sweden. Millions of tons of old mines, ammunition and chemical weapons are believed to lie on the bed of the shallow Baltic Sea, a legacy of two World Wars. Mines – whether old and unexploded or freshly laid – can have an impact beyond destruction, Schmitt-Eliassen said. A mine sighting, or rumoured sighting, can close harbours for days while the area is swept. If that happens in the Baltic, there's a risk ""the supermarket shelves will remain empty."" Even commercial ships can become a military factor in the narrow western entrance to the Baltic, he said, referring to scenarios such as the March 2021 incident when the Ever Given container ship blocked traffic through the Suez Canal for days. ""You cannot blame anybody for this (kind of incident), it is not attributable,"" the chief of the German navy, vice-admiral Jan Christian Kaack, told Reuters. NEXT TARGET? Crucial for the Baltics is the land link between Kaliningrad and Belarus. Called the Suwalki Gap, its seizure would cut the Baltic states off. ""Putin could quickly seize the Suwalki Gap,"" said Domroese, the retired German general, adding this will not happen today or tomorrow, ""but it could happen in a few years."" Putin's recent actions have not all been predictable. He put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert on Feb. 28, with rhetoric that Stoltenberg told Reuters is ""dangerous, it's reckless."" The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment. Putin says Russia's concerns expressed over three decades about NATO's expansion were dismissed by the West, and post-Soviet Russia was humiliated after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. He says NATO, as an instrument of the United States, was building up its military on Ukraine's territory in a way that threatened Russia. On March 11, Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin the West was beefing up military forces close to Russia's Western borders. Putin asked Shoigu to prepare a report on how to respond. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelinskiy has warned that the Baltic states will be Russia's next target. The Baltic Sea is a large and busy shipping market for containers and other cargo, connecting Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia with the rest of the world. It ""has gone from being a normal peaceful area, to an area where you tread carefully,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at the air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta. With demand and logistics disrupted, the fees shippers pay to move cargoes from Hamburg to Saint Petersburg and Kaliningrad are down 15% since the invasion, according to Xeneta data. For almost 25 years, the West believed Russia could be tamed by diplomacy and trade to maintain stability and security in Europe. In 1997, NATO and Russia signed a ""founding act"" that was designed to build trust and limit both sides' force presence in eastern Europe. The alliance also sought to build a partnership with Russia, which took part in NATO exercises in the Baltic as recently as 2012, according to retired U.S. Admiral James Foggo, who commanded U.S. and NATO fleets in Europe for almost a decade until 2020. After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, NATO created small, multinational combat units in Poland and the three Baltic states, which serve as a forward presence to deter Moscow. But the force numbers are designed not to violate the ""founding act,"" which has hindered NATO's ability to move troops into the Baltics and Poland on a permanent basis. ""We all thought that there wouldn't be an enemy anymore,"" Admiral Rob Bauer, the chairman of NATO's military committee, told Reuters. ""We now are confronted with a nation that is showing that it is aggressive, that it has forces that we thought were not going to be used anymore."" While the numbers are changing all the time, the number of troops under the command of NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR) Tod Wolters has more than doubled since Russia's invasion, to around 40,000, according to NATO diplomats and officials. NATO allies have also moved five aircraft carriers into European waters, in Norway and the Mediterranean, increased the number of warplanes in the air in NATO airspace and more than doubled the size of the combat units in the Baltics and Poland. Host nation forces number some 290,000 in the region, but mainly under national control. GERMANY'S MOMENT The biggest shift in NATO's ""new normal,"" diplomats, former officials and experts say, is Germany's reversal of a decades-long policy of low defence spending. Held back by guilt over its wartime past and resulting pacifism among its population, Germany resisted pressure from the United States to increase this to a NATO target of 2% of economic output. France and Britain both meet the goal, but Germany's defence spending was only 1.5% in 2021. With ageing equipment and personnel shortages, Berlin had been seen for decades as a weak partner because of its reluctance to send troops to combat operations. But on Feb. 27, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin would now meet the 2% target - and promised a 100 billion euros ($110 billion) injection into the military. Germany has been concerned by Moscow's presence in the Baltic Sea for a while. After Russia's annexation of Crimea, Berlin forged an alliance of the western navies on the Baltic Sea. ""We simply had to take note of the fact that - whether we like it or not - we are the 900 pound gorilla in the ring,"" said navy chief Kaack. ""The way we look up to the United States as a smaller partner, that's how our partners here look at us."" Soon after Russia's invasion, Berlin announced it would buy 35 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets from the United States to replace its ageing Tornado fleet. NO MORE CONSTRAINTS The United States is also moving more military equipment into Europe, including vehicles and weapons to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland that could be used immediately by newly arriving U.S. troops, rather than waiting weeks for tanks and trucks to be shipped from U.S. bases. Douglas Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told Reuters that NATO's ""new normal"" should be a step up from what the alliance agreed after Crimea. It is likely to be set down in writing in NATO's official master strategy document, known as its ""Strategic Concept,"" which will be agreed at the next NATO summit in Madrid in June. ""You'll see a push forward of combat capability to both reassure eastern allies and to make an even more prominent deterrence message to Russia,"" Lute said. He said NATO's existing multinational combat units in the Baltics and Poland – originally some 5,000 troops in total - should be significantly increased in size. He said he expected ""more sophisticated air defence systems postured forward,"" including Patriot and other systems in the Baltics and Poland. And he expects more U.S. weapons and military equipment to be pre-positioned in Europe. More NATO troops could be stationed in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary. The U.S. delegation to NATO declined to comment. Its envoy, Julianne Smith, said on March 15 the alliance was making commitments to ""have more force posture in Central and Eastern Europe and develop new policy tools."" But – just as in the Cold War – NATO will need to keep communicating with Russia to avoid risking accidents with potentially devastating consequences. ""NATO has some responsibility to do more than just trying to keep Russia out,"" said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now director of the European Leadership Network think tank in London. ""It's about the management of an unavoidable strategic instability.""

3/23/2022,"There are some videos on the internet that leave you speechless. This one, filmed in central Texas Monday, is one of those videos. It shows what looks to be a red first-generation Chevy Silverado pickup truck being tossed around by a tornado and dragged across the ground, with at least one person inside. But that's not the crazy part. After the tornado moves on and the truck is thrown back upright... the truck simply drives away like nothing happened. This happened on a four-lane highway in Elgin, Texas, according to Brian Emfinger, a storm chaser who published the video to Twitter and YouTube on Tuesday. The Chevy is caught in the tornado and subjected to the full force of its winds, causing the vehicle to roll onto its driver side. It does a 360-degree spin while sitting perpendicular to the road before being pushed back upright by the tornado's gusts. Despite what must've been the scariest moment of their life occurring, the driver has no trouble continuing down the road. From what we can tell, the truck looked to be relatively unharmed after the event, save for some sizable scratches on the driver's side body panels and a missing side mirror. It's unclear at this time how many occupants were in the truck, or if anyone inside sustained any injuries. Tornados have been ripping through the Austin area since Monday. At least one person has been killed in the storm, and heavy damage has also been done to residences in its path, the Weather Channel reports. Local news station WFAA published aerial photos showing some of the damage tornados have caused in the area so far.

People were quick to clown her, but it was all in good fun. Watch this tiny bedroom get an organization overhaul in just one day: “There’s so much you don’t know about me,” her caption read. “I like to sleep in jeans.” She added, “[I] can’t believe I’m exposing myself like this.” “I thought I was the only one,” a person commented. “That’s like sociopathic tendencies. That is NOT OK. Lol,” another joked. “I don’t even enjoy wearing jeans during the day,” someone said. Experts tend to be on the side of the comment section here. Gynecologist Dr. Alyssa Dweck told Metro that not only is it best to avoid sleeping with pants on, but it’s preferable to avoid underwear altogether. Dr. Dweck told Metro that when the pubic area “is constantly covered, especially by a fabric that’s not moisture-wicking or absorbent, moisture collects, creating the perfect breeding ground for bacteria or yeast.” This can cause an increase in ingrown hairs and infections in pre-existing ingrown hairs while also making you more susceptible to thrush. For those who like to wear pants or underwear in bed, always opt for something loose-fitting. “If there’s ever a time to break out the granny panties, this would be it,” the doctor told Metro.

3/23/2022,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for a rescue operation and investigation into a China Eastern Airlines jet that crashed into a mountain during a domestic flight on Monday.

Flight MU5735, which carried nine crew members and 123 passengers, reportedly went down near Wuzhou in the Guangxi autonomous region just before 2:30 p.m., Beijing time.

VariFlight, a China-based civil aviation data provider, said the plane was up at about 8,900 meters (approximately 29,200 feet) when it started to slow down and descend at 2:19 p.m. Minutes later, it dropped to 1,300 meters (4,265 feet) and lost radar contact.

Flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com reported a similar account. According to its data, the aircraft was up at about 30,000 feet (9,144 meters) when it entered a deep dive just after 2:20 p.m.
 


A truck driver identified only as Li recalled seeing smoke as he drove to Wuzhou.

“I was about 2-3 kilometers away, I couldn’t hear the sound but the black smoke was there, it looked like an explosion,” Li said.

At approximately 3 p.m., the Wuzhou Fire Brigade deployed 25 fire engines and 117 firefighters to the crash site. A batch of 538 fire and rescue personnel from all over Guanxi followed and helped extinguish the blaze at around 5:15 p.m.

Multiple medical personnel were also deployed to the site; however, not a single survivor has been reported to be found as of this writing.

In response to the crash, China Eastern Airlines reportedly suspended all 737-800 jets and assembled nine teams to deal with accident investigation, aircraft disposal and family assistance. China Eastern is one of the country’s leading airlines.

 Boeing delivered the aircraft, which reportedly had a good safety record, to the airline in June 2015. “[We] can confirm the plane has crashed,” China Eastern said in a statement. “The company expresses its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died in the plane crash.”Later on Monday, Xi called for the immediate activation of emergency mechanisms to address the accident. The State Council, which functions as China’s cabinet, will have its officials investigate the crash as a priority, as well as general safety hazards to improve passenger safety.Premier Li Keqiang called for maximum search and rescue efforts in service of the victims’ families.The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the Ministry of Emergency Management and other relevant departments have also sent working groups to aid in the rescue efforts and aftermath of the crash.

3/23/2022,"Aviation experts are baffled by data showing that a China Eastern Boeing 737-800 about to begin its descent to the city of Guangzhou suddenly plunged vertically to earth like a missile, killing the 123 passengers and nine crew aboard on Monday. This horrific disaster, the worst in recent Chinese aviation history, highlights that the kind of data that once took investigators at least days to gather is now instantly available from open-source tracking sites like FlightRadar. As a result, speculation about the cause of a crash creates an instant Twitter storm as pilots and technical experts attempt to interpret what they are looking at. Boeing 737 Was Plunging at 350MPH in Moments Before Crash in China with 132 Aboard In this case, there is a striking consensus that something very unusual happened that cannot directly relate to previous disasters involving this version of the 737, one of the most flown jets in the world, which preceded the 737-MAX version that was grounded for nearly two years after two catastrophic accidents. The flight pattern revealed by radar shows that the airplane was flying at 29,100 feet over mountainous terrain, with the crew about to prepare for the descent, when the nose abruptly pitched down and it began the dive. As it neared the terrain it seemed to briefly pull up but then resumed the dive to impact with enormous force. The only certain details are what did not happen: There was no indication of an engine fire and no sign of any major part of the airplane breaking up. Significantly, there was no time for the crew to send a Mayday distress call. There have been several cases of various models of the 737 suffering an explosive decompression, when part of the fuselage structure, weakened by undetected cracks in the outer skin, suddenly rips open and the air in the pressurized cabin is released in a blast, but even with that damage pilots have been able to get the airplane down safely, even with parts of the cabin open to the skies. But those events happened early in the flights, when the airplanes were reaching cruise altitude, not as in this case at the end of the cruise and at the beginning of the approach to the airport. One aerospace engineer, commenting on the Aviation Herald site, says, “It is not normal for a plane to nose dive into the ground, it rules out a lot of failures.” Another says, “To those who can’t think of any reason… there are a lot. Some repeats from things that already happened, perhaps something that has never happened before. Aviation is like that.” The Machiavellian Reason China Is Putting the Squeeze on Boeing There was a case where a similar dive was involved: in 1997 Silk Air Flight 185, an earlier model 737, crashed into a river in Sumatra, killing 104 people; an investigation by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the pilot had deliberately triggered the dive in an act of suicide, but this verdict was disputed by Indonesian regulators, who cited problems with the rudder controls that had caused other crashes of that model. Another possibility is that although no break-up was visible on the radar track, some part of the horizontal stabilizer, which would be activated to begin descent, may have broken off. All of this leads to one urgent task—to find an answer in the one place where it should be found, in the airplane’s black boxes. The crash site is accessible and teams are headed there. There is, however, some concern that these flight data recorders might not survive such a devastating impact. The Chinese regulators and investigators are highly regarded. China was the first country to ground the 737-Max and the last to allow it to return to the skies. Domestic air travel in China has grown rapidly in the last decade, but there have been very few accidents. Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/23/2022,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Four teenagers face murder charges in connection with a carjacking that left a 73-year-old woman dying on a New Orleans street, her arm severed after she was dragged a block by her own car while neighbors looked on helplessly, officials said Tuesday. Police chief Shaun Ferguson said tips led to the arrests of the teens — a 17-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl and two 15-year-old girls — in the hours after the Monday afternoon carjacking. Two were turned in by their parents. All face second-degree murder charges, and Ferguson said he will recommend that they be charged as adults “That's a conversation that my team will have with the district attorney's office,"" Ferguson said at a Tuesday morning news conference. ""I would say absolutely, I encourage, I will ask, that they be charged as adults. ... I mean, look at the nature of the crime.” Ferguson confirmed that Linda Frickey died after she become entangled in a seatbelt as carjackers sped away with her vehicle. “The door had closed on the seatbelt, but she was stuck in it,” resident Todd Ecker told WVUE-TV on Monday. “I got out of my vehicle, screaming for them, ‘Please stop, you’re dragging a lady.' Other neighbors were also screaming at them.” A tearful Leanne Mascar and her husband Mark Mascar tried to comfort the victim as she died at the scene. “I was telling this woman to hang in there,” Mark Mascar told the TV station. “Every time I heard a siren, I was hoping and praying that was an ambulance.” On Tuesday morning, Ferguson credited the arrests to police working throughout the night and information from a variety of sources, including two suspects' parents. “The parents of one 15-year-old female immediately called our investigators and turned their daughter in,” Ferguson said, adding that the parents of another suspect followed with more information that led to an arrest. “This was an incredibly difficult decision on behalf of these parents,” Ferguson said. Monday afternoon's gruesome carjacking death came hours after police reported a triple-homicide in another part of the city. Police said three people were found dead in an apartment in the Gentilly neighborhood. The victims, two men and a woman, had all been shot. No suspects have been identified and police were asking for the public's help for information on the shootings. New Orleans' homicide total for the year rose to 61 with the four deaths.

3/23/2022,"A pro-Kremlin tabloid claimed in an article that close to 10,000 Russian soldiers have died during the country’s invasion of Ukraine, citing Russia’s Ministry of Defense, before deleting the information and claiming they were the result of a hack. The paper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, said in an article that 9,861 Russian soldiers had died and 16,153 had been injured during the invasion, according to data from the Defense Ministry. However, the article was reposted minutes later without the paragraph providing information on casualties. The original article was captured by the Internet Archive. The paper said the information was added by a hacker in a statement released shortly after the paragraph was deleted. The article couched those figures as a response to Ukrainian officials who claimed to have inflicted crippling losses on the Russian military. Ukraine claimed on Saturday that up to 14,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in fighting, while U.S.-intelligence estimates put the number of Russian dead at around 7,000. The Russian Ministry of Defense had previously acknowledged the combat deaths of just 498 soldiers. No other outlets carried the alleged Russian Ministry of Defense figures reported by Komsomolskaya Pravda. Russia has enacted policies to censor news and social media during the war with Ukraine, including passing a law that punishes citizens convicted of spreading “false information” on the war with up to 15 years in prison. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova on March 14 held up a sign that read “Stop the war. Don’t believe propaganda. They’re lying to you,” during a live broadcast by her former employer, Russia’s Channel One. Ovsyannikova was detained and fined 30,000 rubles over a separate video but still faces potential charges under the new law, according to ABC News. While Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid March that around 1,300 Ukrainian troops had died in the fighting, the government has not disclosed official casualty numbers. Civilian casualties also continue to mount in Ukraine. Russian forces are currently besieging the southern port city of Mariupol, where Ukrainian officials say around 2,000 civilians have been killed. Russian forces targeted a shopping mall in Kyiv on Monday, with at least eight people reportedly killed in that attack, according to Sky News.

3/23/2022,"After noticing that his intake of sweet snacks had increased significantly in recent months, YouTuber Cam Jones decides to remove all food with added sugar from his diet for 30 days to see what kind of impact it might have on his health and overall wellbeing. But all it takes is his first ""cursed"" trip to the grocery store on day one of the challenge to understand that this will be more difficult than he first thought.
 ""I quickly realized how much added sugar is in the stuff that I normally buy,"" he says. ""There's even added sugar in the things I assumed were healthy, and the more I look at labels, the less things I add to my cart."" It also doesn't take long for the early side effects of giving up added sugar to make themselves known, either: Cam soon begins to experience intense cravings, a drop in his energy levels and ability to focus on work, and headaches. Looking back, he believes that is a result of his brain missing the extra boost of dopamine that it gets when eating sugar. ""This can lead to overconsumption and reliance, and then withdrawals,"" he says. ""On the plus side, withdrawal symptoms are only supposed to last a few weeks, so hopefully this is the hardest part and things can only go up from here."" Cam turns his attention to making alternatives to his favorite snacks, including kale chips and sweet potato fries, and stocks up on fruit so that he can still enjoy something sweet when the craving takes him. ""Once I get a feel for the snack situation, things really start to look up,"" he says. In the final two weeks of the challenge, Cam finally starts to feel some positive effects. ""I feel like on the whole I'm eating healthier and being more strategic with my meals to help stay full and fend off cravings,"" he says. ""I'm also starting to notice my energy levels evening out. I've been able to get some good workouts in without feeling exhausted later on in the day."" However, he has to admit that this restrictive diet ""takes a lot of the fun out of eating"" and makes it harder to be spontaneous. ""It even limits how you can celebrate special occasions,"" he says. ""I don't think it's helpful to treat sugar as a bad thing, but what I do think is important is being in control of how much you consume on a regular basis,"" he concludes. ""For me, I feel like these last 30 days have really helped me regain some of that control and build my intuition so I can be smarter about my eating habits going forward.""

3/23/2022,"Juice — a Ukrainian fighter pilot who only went by his call sign and wore his helmet and visor to protect his identity — appeared Mondayon Anderson Cooper 360 to speak about the fight for the skies above Ukraine. Juice, who was given the name by friends in the California Air National Guard, admitted that Russia can currently claim air superiority, but said Russian casualties are mounting. “Russians have a lot of loss — losses, and they have a fear of our air defense,” Juice said. “So they couldn’t fly here just comfortable for them.” Juice said he’s currently on standby, awaiting orders if a threat arises, and spoke of his current role in defending Ukraine. “I’m sitting just near [the] aircraft or just in the cockpit,” Juice said, “and my colleagues from the radar units, they’re just giving me the information about targets, and I’m taking off and intercepting these threats.” Though the U.S. is continuing to supply Ukraine with defense systems, it blocked the transfer of fighter jets from Poland that would have gone to Ukraine via a U.S. air base in Germany. Juice said they need more jets if they are to gain air superiority. “We need efficient ground air defense systems,” Juice said, “and we need some other fighter jets to gain the air superiority to fight effectively against these threats.” And Juice said that he and others are ready to continue their defense against Russia’s war of aggression. “All of us are ready to fight, just with our jets, with our guns, even just in the fields with rifles. So our people, including me, we are ready to fight Russians, and we are ready to defend our country, to defend our people in absolutely any ways. But we need tools, effective tools, to do this efficiently.” Anderson Cooper 360 airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on CNN. Check this tense moment on the American Idol set as the judges are targeted by a bizarre prank: On American Idol Monday, things got a little tense between Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and a production assistant, who had been annoying them all day with her antics – noisily banging on the set's grand piano while wiping down the keys and leaving her phone on during auditions.
Eventually, Katy reached her boiling point, when the crew member decided it was snack time during a contestant's audition, loudly crinkling a bag of chips. Katy stood up, walked over to the PA and angrily confiscated the bag of chips, and that's when things got weird.
The face-masked mysterage crew member stomped over to the judges' desk and violently snatched back her bag of chips, while a shocked Luke exclaimed, ""Chill!"" However, it wasn't until Uncle Lionel Richie got involved, calling security, that Katy finally walked over to the troublemaker to pull her hat off, revealing that it was Luke's wife Carole all along.
Caroline and Luke have a long history, dating back to their college dating years, of pranking each other. In fact, Caroline is even known for her annual ""Prankmus"" every Christmas. And on Monday, Luke totally fell for it yet again.
“You’ve been punk’d!” cackled Lionel, who wasn’t in on the joke and was just as fooled by Caroline and Katy’s elaborate act.

3/23/2022,"Nina Agdal, 29, just revealed her fit bod in a brand new nude Instagram selfie. The supermodel recently started her own fitness platform to share her workouts and recipes with others. ""You have to start listening to what your body needs,"" she says. ""Finding that inner voice is the biggest trick."" Short on #fitspo lately? Look no further than Nina Agdal's Instagram. The supermodel, 29, just posted a brand new nude selfie—and she's looking incredibly toned from head to toe. ""Instagram took this down so I’m obviously gonna post it again,"" Nina captioned the snap. And, fans in the comments could not stop sending 🔥 emojis her way. ""Body positivity 🔥,"" one user wrote. Someone else added, ""Goddess!🔥."" ""Obviously I’m gonna like it again 🔥,"" another comment read. Luckily, Nina's not shy about sharing the details on the fitness routine that whips her washboard abs and sculpted butt into shape. For starters, Nina has worked hard to build a routine that works for her body. ""I’ve had very different relationships over time with fitness, wellness, and nutrition,"" she told W Magazine. ""I really believe in finding something that can be a lifestyle and a healthy habit that makes you happy."" Nina says her wake-up call came when she realized her old approach wasn't working anymore. “I would go on these benders and work out, like, three to four times a day, and be like, ‘Why is my body not changing?’ ” she told Health, per People. “My friends would say, ‘You need to rest. You’ve got to let your muscles relax so they can react again.’ Sometimes less is more when it comes to workout routines.” Today, Nina likes to shake it up in the gym. “I do a bunch of Y7 yoga,"" she said. ""I also do boxing, which is great for everything, and I go to Equinox and do the SoulCycle thing. I always switch it up because if not, I don’t see a difference."" (She added that she particularly likes yoga because it strengthens her arms, ""which can be a tough area for me to get really toned in."") Nina has since launched her very own fitness platform, called The Agdal Method. The program includes workouts, wellness advice, and recipes. “I’m not here to tell you what to do,” she told W Magazine. “I’m here to help you find out what works for you.” Nina designs The Agdal Method workouts herself. ""My workouts are all about sculpting and toning while building lean muscle. I do that through yoga/Pilates inspired movement using either your own bodyweight or lighter hand weights. I mix in cardio to build endurance through my treadmill routines that are all about intervals so you don’t end up getting bored doing the same thing for 30 minutes,"" she explained to The Daily. Nina has also shared plenty of her workouts on Instagram before, like this three-minute sculpt session: And, last year, Nina's fitness goals led her to running a half marathon (indoors). ""Goes to show how powerful a strong mindset is and that you are capable of so much more if you believe YOU CAN,"" she wrote.    A post shared by Nina Agdal (@ninaagdal) As for her diet, Nina isn't big on a.m. meals. “I actually don’t eat breakfast,” she told Hollywood Life. “I prefer to have a juice or a smoothie in the morning. I’m a big believer in fasting, so I don’t eat anything until lunch, which is usually around 2:00 P.M. or 3:00 P.M."" Lunch is usually protein (like eggs or fish) with a side of veggies. Later, dinner could be pretty much anything except red meat. ""It’s about letting go a little bit and trusting your own body. You have to start listening to what your body needs,"" Nina shared with W Magazine. ""Finding that inner voice is the biggest trick. It starts by letting go and not being so tough on ourselves.""

3/23/2022,"Watch: Fire rages after Boeing 737 jet 'crashes into mountainside' in China A Boeing 737 airliner with 132 people aboard has crashed into a mountainous area in southern China in what looks set to be the country’s most deadly plane crash for decades. The aircraft, on a flight from the city of Kunming to Guangzhou, slammed into a thick forest of bamboo on a hillside in Guanxi province. Thick smoke and huge flames could be seen rising on a video posted by the South China Morning Post but it was unclear whether the was already a fire in the area. Tracking data showed the aircraft cruising at 29,100 feet at 2.20 p.m. Some two minutes later it had dropped to just over 9,000 feet and 20 seconds after that to just 3,225 feet. FlightRadar said that indicated a vertical descent of 31,000 feet per minute—or around 350 mph. Another video circulating on social media, the authenticity of which The Daily Beast could not immediately verify, appeared to show the aircraft streaking into the ground in a nose-down vertical position. U.S. government-backed Radio Free Asia reported that the video was captured by CCTV at a mine. “Can confirm the plane has crashed,” China Eastern Airlines said in a statement announcing a special hotline for passengers’ relatives. Flight MU5735 left the southwestern city of Kunming at 1:11 p.m. and had been due to land at Guanzhou at 3:05 p.m. According to data from FlightRadar24, the six-year-old Boeing 737-800 was last tracked at 2:22 p.m. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said the aircraft, with 123 passengers and nine crew aboard, had lost contact over the city of Wuzhou. Earlier reports from Chinese state media had said there were 133 people on board. Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed his shock at the news and called for an “all-out effort” in the rescue operation. But according to a firefighting official quoted by the state-run People’s Daily newspaper, there was no sign of life among the debris. Watch: China passenger jet crashes Once known as a black spot for plane crashes, China has cleaned up its act in recent years, investing in a young modern fleet of aircraft and strict safety controls. China’s last fatal airliner accident is thought to have been in 2010, when an an Embraer E-190 jet flown by Henan Airlines crashed on approach to Yichun airport in low visibility. Forty-four of 96 people aboard were killed. Mainland China’s most deadly crash was in June 1994, when a Tupolev TU-154 broke up in mid-flight, killing all 160 people aboard. Boeing started making the 737-800, a narrow-bodied single-aisle commuter plane, in the mid-1990s and delivered 5,200 to airlines around the world before it was phased out two years ago. China Eastern has more than 100 of the planes, which it has now grounded while Monday's crash is investigated. Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/23/2022,"By Abdelaziz Boumzar and Marko Djurica BROVARY, Ukraine (Reuters) - Three U.S. volunteer fighters who have risked their lives alongside Ukrainian soldiers said they had joined the struggle against Russian forces to stop civilians suffering and in the name of freedom. The group, including a female college student from New York who works at JFK airport, spoke of their narrow escape after they said the vehicle they were travelling in hit a land mine on Sunday on the frontline near the capital Kyiv. Reuters could not independently verify the identity of the three foreign fighters nor their description of the incident. A Ukrainian combatant who was with the three at the time was being treated at Brovary Hospital on the outskirts of the capital after suffering serious injuries. ""We thought he was dead, he was slumped over and unresponsive,"" Alexis Antilla, who was acting as a combat medic for the team of fighters and was herself injured in the explosion, told Reuters at the hospital. ""When the fire started to consume him, he started to wake up and we were able to get him out,"" she said. Speaking a couple of hours after the incident, Antilla said a second landmine exploded shortly after the first, sending rounds of ammunition that the group was carrying flying past their heads. Despite the close encounter with death, she said she wanted to return to the frontline as soon as her injuries healed. ""I felt a calling to come here, I felt like it was the right thing to do, I feel like what's happening here, what Putin is doing, is evil,"" she said. ""There is no need to put millions and millions of people through the suffering and torment that they are going through, and I felt I had to be here to help in any way that I could."" Red Taylor, from Tennessee, said that the Ukrainian with them spoke good English and spotted the landmine but that the group ""could not even count a second between the time he said there are landmines everywhere and the 'boom'"". Their commander, who only gave his name as Rob and said he was from Connecticut, has been fighting in Ukraine for three weeks. ""I don't like what they are doing to the civilians and what they are doing to all these people. My boys and me feel the same. There has to be justice in this world for people that want to live free, and that's what we fight for,"" he said. Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine and capture nationalists. While Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered, they have mounted significant resistance. Ukraine has also established an international legion for people from abroad, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has publicly urged foreigners to come and fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russians, whom he describes as ""war criminals"". Zelenskiy has said that more than 16,000 foreigners have volunteered, without specifying how many had arrived.

Bella-Rae Birch died in hospital after being attacked on Monday afternoon in Bidston Avenue in Blackbrook. In a statement given via Merseyside Police, the family thanked the community for their support. They said: ""We would ask that we are now allowed some space and time to try and come to terms with the tragic loss of our much-loved Bella-Rae. ""She will be sadly missed but never forgotten."" Superintendent Steve Brizell said: ""Bella-Rae has lost her life in the most unimaginably terrible circumstances and our thoughts are first and foremost with the family and the wider community at this devastating time. ""Our specialist family liaison officers are providing the family of Bella-Rae with support and officers will remain in the area in the coming days to provide further reassurance and support for the wider community. ""At this stage we understand that the family dog they had bought just a week earlier has attacked Bella-Rae inside the family home. ""Bella-Rae was taken by ambulance to hospital by paramedics but despite the best efforts of police officers at scene, paramedics and doctors sadly Bella-Rae died as a result of her injuries yesterday afternoon. ""It has left a family and a community grieving and in complete shock."" The force said the dog had been humanely destroyed and work was ongoing to determine its breed and its previous owners. Joanne Matthews, a 53 year old neighbour, told the PA news agency: ""She was such a beautiful little girl, toddling about. ""I'd see the family in passing, just to say hello, and they were always very pleasant."" Ms Matthews said she saw an ambulance outside the house in Bidston Avenue at about 3.50pm on Monday and then about 10 police vehicles arrive. She said: ""I saw them bring the dog out. I couldn't tell what breed it was but from the back it looked like a Staffordshire bull terrier or pit bull.""

3/23/2022,"During Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, quizzed Jackson on critical race theory, an academic theory of racism’s systemic impact that has been assailed by conservatives. Teachers groups and schools tend to argue that CRT is not often taught below the university level. Jackson — who, if confirmed, would become the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court — said she had “never studied critical race theory” and “never used it.” “It doesn't come up in my work as a judge,” she said, adding that it was her understanding that it was taught in law schools. Cruz then held up books — including “Antiracist Baby” by Ibram Kendi — that he said was used at Georgetown Day School in Washington, D.C., where Jackson is a board member. An aide displayed posters showing enlarged pages from the book behind him. “Do you agree with this book that is being taught to kids that babies are racist?” Cruz asked. Jackson paused before answering. “Senator, I do not believe that any child should be made to feel as though they are racist or that they are not valued, or though they are less than or that they are victims or oppressors,” she said. “I don't believe in any of that.” Jackson added that such themes “don’t come up in my work as a judge, which I’m respectfully here to address.” Earlier on Tuesday during her hearing, the GOP’s main Twitter account posted a GIF of Jackson that included her initials — “KBJ” — being crossed out and replaced with “CRT.” The Republican Party’s tweet was widely criticized as a “racist dog whistle.”",Politics/Yahoo News,Ted Cruz quizzes Jackson on CRT at Supreme Court confirmation hearing,https://news.yahoo.com/cruz-ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-crt-202229724.html
3/23/2022,"Bill Maher thinks California could very well turn red if certain things don’t turn around. On “The Adam Carolla Show” Tuesday, Maher contributed his opinion on the future of the state. Around 33 minutes into the show, host Adam Carolla broached Maher’s “solar panel saga,” which Maher chronicled on his HBO show in 2021. Maher and Carolla went on to discuss rules and policies that restrict California natives, as well as issues that demand solving. “First of all we know there’s been an exodus from this state,” Maher began. “That’s partly because of high taxes and it’s partly because fire season is all year round. But it’s also because people can’t f—ing do anything. “I just read that the cost of building a single unit for the homeless has now risen to $837,000,” Maher said. “I just don’t think people understand the level of graft that is built into the system, the level of corruption, and that’s what I was getting at when I made that crusade about my solar.” The conversation returned to solar panels and the challenges with their installation. “Can you imagine the level of corruption, but level of bureaucracy that I was ranting and raving about this on the air for over a year and they still couldn’t get it done?” Maher went on. “I have a picture of 11 people at my house that finally showed. Eleven people. To turn on a lightbulb, basically, I had to build a shed to house the thing. I had to build its own home. Which could probably house the homeless, people could probably live in that shed. “All the regulations that, I mean, I don’t know if it’s Orwellian, or Kafka-esque, or both of them, but it’s just strange. Very strange,” he continued. “The hoops you had to jump through to do something that the state was advising you to do. Solar power was something – I thought I was being a good citizen trying to hook up.” When Carolla described his own experience attempting and then abandoning the project after realizing how complicated state and county regulations can get, Maher picked up on Carolla’s decision to “f— it.” “‘Fuck it’ is what so many people say about so many things out here [in California]. Eventually what they are going to say is ‘then f— it to the Democratic party’,” he said. “This is an achilles heel to this party that they have to come to terms with. I mean, they couldn’t build a railroad, they tried, from L.A. to San Francisco. Same thing with the housing- the homeless thing. “There are just too many people with their hand out. There are too many people who are unnecessary in this equation,” Maher continued. “This is kind of beyond politics and it will get hung on, deservedly so, the Democrats. “It’s not like the Republicans are great on this either, but they don’t run the state right now,” Maher finished. “The Democrats do.” You can watch the full video here.",U.S./The Wrap,Bill Maher Thinks California May Turn Red Because ‘People Can’t F–ing Do Anything’,https://news.yahoo.com/bill-maher-thinks-california-may-202658914.html
3/23/2022,"Senior U.S. officials are coming to believe that Russia has moderated its war goals in Ukraine after stiff resistance inflicted heavy losses and shattered any hope of a swift and easy victory, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Per the Journal, international observers believed Russian President Vladimir Putin's initial objective was to capture Kyiv within days, depose Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and install a pro-Russian puppet regime. Now, Biden administration officials told the Journal, Putin's goals appear to be less ambitious. If Putin can bully Ukraine into accepting neutrality, recognizing Russian claims on Crimea and the Donbas, and surrendering a ""land bridge"" connecting the two, he'll be able to spin that as a win back home. Securing this land bridge would require capturing the port city of Mariupol. Russian forces encircled the city weeks ago and have been pushing into its neighborhoods in recent days. On Sunday, Russia demanded that the city surrender, but Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk replied early Monday that ""[t]here can be no question of surrender,"" Reuters reports. Putin may well be looking for an off-ramp from this war. An assessment released Saturday by the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C., concluded that Ukraine has ""defeated the initial Russian campaign"" and that Russian forces must take a ""lengthy operational pause"" to regroup if they are to have any chance of capturing major Ukrainian cities. In an address to the nation on Sunday, Zelensky said Ukrainian forces have killed over 14,000 Russian troops since the invasion began less than four weeks ago. The U.S., which estimates Russian military deaths at around 7,000, lost just over 4,500 troops during the nine-year Iraq War. None of this is certain, however. The Institute for the Study of War released another assessment on Sunday reporting that Russia appears to be ""preparing its population"" for a protracted conflict by ""implementing increasingly draconian mobilization measures.""

3/23/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces said Russian troops used stun grenades and gunfire to disperse a rally of pro-Ukrainian protesters in the occupied southern city of Kherson on Monday. Russia did not immediately comment on the incident. Moscow denies targeting civilians. Video footage showed several hundred protesters in Kherson's Freedom Square running to escape as projectiles land around them. Loud bangs can be heard and there are clouds of whitish smoke. Gunfire can also be heard. ""Russian security forces ran up, started throwing stun grenades into the crowd and shooting,"" the Ukrainian armed forces' press service said in a statement. It said at least one person was wounded but that it was unclear how they received their injuries. Reuters was unable to verify independently what weapons were fired. The video showed some protesters returning to the square. One man in a black hat strolled back, stopped across the road from Russian troops and stood there on his own, holding a small Ukrainian flag above his head. The city of Kherson, a regional capital of about 250,000 people, was the first big urban centre to fall into the hands of Russian troops after they invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Since then, groups of residents have staged regular rallies in the centre of Kherson, protesting against the occupation and showing their support for the government in Kyiv by waving Ukrainian flags. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian authorities said members of Russia's National Guard had detained more than 400 people in Kherson region for protesting against the occupation. It accused Russia of trying to create a police state there. Russia calls the war a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from ""Nazis"".

The women, aged from 20 to 60, are new recruits in the Women's Voluntary Defence Organisation, part of Estonia's state-run paramilitary defence.

In contrast to Ukraine, the Baltic states enjoy the mutual protection of the NATO Treaty, which states that all members will help them if they are attacked. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kalas said on Tuesday her country feels no direct military threat, but the women at the training were not so sure. A few miles from Amari airbase, where NATO allies' planes are deployed to patrol the skies of Baltic states, the introductory training did not include shooting with the guns, but the women learned how to apply camouflage on their faces, navigate in the woods and communicate via radios.

3/23/2022,"Arnold Schwarzenegger’s video appeal to the Russian people has been remarkably effective. The famed film star and former California governor posted it not only on Twitter, but also on Telegram, which is used almost exclusively by Russians. For days, Russian state media tried to ignore it altogether—but millions of views across multiple platforms forced them to address Schwarzenegger’s powerful message. “That face is the cover page of American imperialism and colonialism,” TV host Vadim Gigin declared on state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Solovievon, raging about Arnold Schwarzenegger and his video clip. “Not the caricature image of Uncle Sam, but this Schwarz, in a Hollywood production.” Wild Kremlin TV Hosts Threaten the U.S. With Nuclear Strikes Unless Sanctions End and Reparations Are Paid Gigin seemed particularly peeved with the first comments Arnold made in his video. In an effort to dodge state media’s propensity to immediately dismiss any criticism as “Russophobia,” Arnold had opened his address with reminders of his fondness for the Russian people, with years of positive interactions long before Vladimir Putin started a full-fledged war against Ukraine. “He, in California, will tell us, who live here… the truth?! That is their approach towards us,” Gigin fumed. Visibly furious, Gigin recounted the second half of Schwarzenegger’s video, where he mentioned the cup gifted to him by champion weightlifter Yury Vlasov, which Arnold continues to use to this very day. Gigin opined that Schwarzenegger never understood Vlasov, who opposed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. “Vlasov couldn’t transfer any of his brain [to Schwarzenegger] with his handshake and the gifted cup,” he sniped. Host Vladimir Soloviev then chimed in by pointing out: “Schwarzenegger twice traveled to Iraq to support the American troops and never tried to tell the Iraqi people why they’re being destroyed.” It’s not only state media pundits who are outraged with Arnold’s video. Russian powerlifter champion Maryana Naumova, who has expressed her admiration for the likes of notorious Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad, weighed in with her response to the message, which was published by the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda on Monday. In her commentary, Naumova accused the American film star of “living in an alternative, imaginary reality.” Baselessly accusing the Ukrainian government of Nazism, she claimed: “The fact that Mr. Zelensky, as you say, is a Jew, did not help them. Nazism has no nationality, Nazism is not based on the word ‘German.’ And Russophobia is no better than anti-Semitism.” Referring to Schwarzenegger’s famed feature films, Naumova proclaimed: “Do you remember how in the second part of the Terminator your hero goes back in time to prevent the creation of Skynet, which would bring the death of all mankind? Russia's special military operation does not aim to destroy the Ukrainian people. It is aimed at the neo-Nazi Skynet, which over the years has completely subjugated Ukraine and was about to turn into an uncontrollable monster, dangerous for all of its neighbors, not only for us... Don’t side with Skynet, Terminator.” Zakhar Prilepin, a famous Russian writer who boasted of “killing many” in the last war in Donbas, and who is wanted by Ukraine’s SBU security service on charges of “taking part in the activity of a terrorist organization,” also had harsh words for Arnold. Prilepin wrote on his Telegram channel: “In his video message, Schwarzenegger, who killed three million Russians in his films, told the Russian people how much he loves us and how wrong we are about Ukraine... This Austrian, the son of his father, who served in the SS and was wounded near Leningrad, is trying to act as the good cop.” Russian Forces Destroy Massive Kyiv Mall, Killing at Least Eight Prilepin complained that the United States is “pumping Ukraine full of weapons to massacre the Russians,” failing to mention that Russia is the aggressor in this war. He added: “Arnie, you are a predator and an enemy.” As a guest on Soloviev’s Sunday show, Prilepin stressed that the Russians shouldn’t try to convince the West of their humanity and good will. He argued that Russia’s approach towards the West should be as harsh as possible: “If they’re seriously afraid of the conflict with Russia, of WWIII, of nuclear war or the escalation of the conflict, we should be convincing them that we’re ready for it, that we love it, that we like to make war.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/23/2022,"By Martin Quin Pollard WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Rescuers in southern China searched for survivors from a China Eastern Airlines jet on Tuesday after it crashed with 132 people on board and authorities said severe damage to the aircraft would make it difficult to establish the cause of the crash. Flight MU5735 was headed on Monday for the port city of Guangzhou from Kunming, capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, when it plunged from cruising altitude to crash in the mountains of Guangxi less than an hour before landing time. A jet appeared to dive to the ground at an angle of about 35 degrees from the vertical in video images from a vehicle's dashboard camera, according to Chinese media. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage. No survivors have been found yet, said Zhu Tao, director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters. ""The jet was seriously damaged during the crash, and investigations will face a very high level of difficulty,"" Zhu said at the first government briefing on the disaster. ""Given the information currently available, we still do not have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash,"" he said, adding that the aircraft did not respond to repeated calls from air controllers during its rapid descent. On Tuesday, rescuers combed heavily forested mountain slopes in southern China, using shovels and torches in their search for victims and flight recorders from the jet that crashed with 132 people on board. About 600 soldiers, firefighters and police marched to the crash site, a patch of about 1 sq km in a location hemmed in by mountains on three sides, after excavators cleared a path, state television said. It added that the search for the recorders, or ""black boxes"", of the Boeing 737-800 involved in China's first crash of a commercial jetliner since 2010, would be carried out in grid-by-grid fashion, probably through the night. 'BANG, BANG' Si, 64, a villager near the crash site who declined to give his first name, told Reuters he heard a ""bang, bang"" at the time of the crash. ""It was like thunder,"" he said. State television has shown images of plane debris strewn among trees charred by fire. Burnt remains of identity cards and wallets were also seen. Rain was forecast in the area this week. Police set up a checkpoint at Lu village, on the approach to the site, and barred journalists from entering. Several people gathered for a small Buddhist ceremony nearby to pray for the victims. The last commercial jetliner to crash in China was in 2010, when an Embraer E-190 regional jet flown by Henan Airlines went down, killing 44 of the 96 aboard. Highlighting the top-level concern, Vice Premier Liu He went to Guangxi on Monday night to oversee search and rescue operations. An official of the same rank was similarly sent to the site of the 2010 crash in northeast China. ""That B737-800 jet met airworthiness standards before taking off and technical conditions were stable,"" Sun Shiying, a China Eastern official, said at the briefing. ""The crew members were in good health, and their flying experience was in line with regulatory requirements,"" he said. PLANES GROUNDED The disaster comes as Boeing seeks to rebound from several crises, notably the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on air travel and safety concerns over its 737 MAX model following two deadly crashes. ""Accidents that start at cruise altitude are usually caused by weather, deliberate sabotage, or pilot error,"" Dan Elwell, a former head of U.S. regulator the Federal Aviation Administration, told Reuters. Elwell, who led the FAA during the 737-MAX crisis, said mechanical failures in modern commercial jets were rare at cruise altitude. The 737-800 was delivered on June 22, 2015, and accumulated 18,239 hours of flight time after 8,986 flights, said Zhu. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Monday appointed an investigator, as the Boeing aircraft was produced in the United States, but it was unclear if the investigator would travel to China. On Monday, China Eastern and two subsidiaries grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes. The group has 225 of the aircraft, data from British aviation consultancy IBA shows.

3/23/2022,"EGLIN AFB — An F-22 Raptor from the 325th Fighter Wing ""experienced a mishap on landing"" at Eglin Air Force Base shortly before 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to a brief announcement released from the base's public affairs office shortly before 1 p.m. No details were available except that emergency crews responded to the scene and the ""pilot was transported to flight medicine for an evaluation."" Emergency crews remained on the scene into the afternoon hours Tuesday, and Runway 19 at the base was closed, although flight operations could continue on the installation's remaining runway. ""The dispatch of emergency crews is a normal response,"" Eglin spokeswoman Ilka Cole said in an email to the Daily News following the base's initial announcement of the mishap. She said that crews respond to ensure pilot safety and to secure the incident site for aircraft recovery. Mishap from 2020: Re-creation of May 2020 F-22 mishap at Eglin AFB More from AFB: Air Force legacy bombers temporarily join fighter jets on Eglin flight line An investigation of the circumstances surrounding the mishap was underway, according to the Eglin announcement. The Daily News is following this story and will publish updates as additional information becomes available. Almost exactly a year ago on March 15, 2021, there was a similar incident at Eglin when an F-22 assigned to the 325th Fighter Wing experienced what appeared to be a nose gear failure upon landing at the base. Eglin officials described the incident as ""a ground mishap"" connected to ""an in-flight emergency."" The aircraft involved in that incident landed safely, fire crews responded and the pilot was transported to flight medicine for evaluation. The 325th Fighter Wing is based at Tyndall Air Force Base in nearby Panama City, but the wing's flying operations moved to Eglin after of 2018's Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 storm, made a direct hit on Tyndall AFB. The most serious incident involving an F-22 from the 325th Fighter Wing flying out of Eglin came on the morning of May 15, 2020, when a jet crashed in a wooded area of the installation about 12 miles northeast of the main section of the base during what the Air Force described as a routine training mission. The pilot ejected safely and there were no injuries on the ground, but the aircraft, valued at $201 million, was destroyed. The crashed Raptor, which went down after the pilot began having difficulty controlling the jet, was part of an air combat training exercise involving two other F-22s, six F-35 fighter jets, four F-16 fighter jets and one T-38 jet-training aircraft.

In an update on Tuesday, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Russia had suffered ""large, irreversible” losses of personnel, including among its command. The update said that following a counter-attack launched by Ukrainian forces in the south, ""the enemy is compelled to retreat to unfavourable borders"" towards Mykolaiv, a city near the Black Sea. Officials added: ""Having lost its offensive potential, the Russian occupation forces continue to form and move reserves from the depths of the Russian Federation to the borders of Ukraine."" It comes after Ukrainian troops regained the strategically important Kyiv suburb of Makariv early on Tuesday, retaking control of a key highway and blocking Russian troops from surrounding the city from the north-west. ​​Follow the latest updates below. Mariupol’s war-torn streets now resemble Stalingrad, a British man trapped in the city as he fights alongside Ukrainians has told The Telegraph. Aiden Aslin, who has joined a Ukrainian marine unit, said that Russian troops were targeting ambulances and hospitals, and that conditions were getting ever more desperate. The 28-year-old said food and water were running out and the situation for 300,000 civilians still unable to escape “will only get worse”.

Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said the French car maker’s decision to restart manufacturing in Moscow would only ""cushion"" the Russian economy from the impact of Western sanctions. The company behind the Clio and Kadjar models was forced to halt production last month over logistical problems caused by Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Read the full story from Ben Woods here Ukraine's peace negotiators may not be prepared for the belligerent KGB tactics of their Russian counterparts, a senior government adviser has warned. Luliia Osmolovska, an adviser to the Ukraine government, said Moscow's team was taught to belittle opponents and will not engage constructively in talks with Kyiv until there is a “moment of ripeness”. She told The Telegraph: “This moment appears when both parties understand the status quo is intolerable for both of them and they can't resolve issues unilaterally without communicating and engaging in cooperation with the other side.

""President Zelensky is invited to address the NATO summit via video link,"" a NATO official said Tuesday. ""This will be an opportunity for allied leaders to hear directly from President Zelensky about the dire situation facing the people of Ukraine because of Russia's aggression."" President Joe Biden is seeking to reinforce Western unity at a series of summits in Europe this week where new sanctions will be announced against Russia over its war in Ukraine, a top US official said Tuesday. Biden leaves Wednesday for Brussels a day ahead of summits with NATO and the European Council, then a trip to Poland on Friday for a meeting with President Andrzej Duda the following day. The intense diplomacy marks a crucial moment in the dangerous standoff between a newly reinvigorated transatlantic alliance and President Vladimir Putin, who a month ago sent the Russian army pouring into pro-Western Ukraine to try and upend the balance of European power. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that Biden will seek to ""reinforce the incredible unity we built with allies and partners."" The mother of the British captain of a superyacht allegedly owned by Vladimir Putin has said her son would never work for a “murderer”. An anti-corruption unit working for the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny claims that the £500 million yacht Scheherezade is secretly owned by Russia’s president. Italian authorities are now under pressure to seize the yacht and investigate any links to Mr Putin. Reports claim it is the world’s most expensive yacht whose owner has not been publicly identified. Read the full story from Robert Mendick, Phoebe Southworth and Andrea Vogt here. They called her the Angel of Mostar. A British woman driving an old Renault across the front line in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sally Becker was like a character in a film, writes Rosa Silverman. Working off her own bat, with no official support or training, Becker, then 30, delivered aid, and evacuated wounded children and their mothers, during a frenzied period of the Balkans conflict in the early Nineties, when the historic city of Mostar was besieged and embattled. Even as shelling reduced nearly 70 per cent of the buildings in the west to ruins, killing hundreds of civilians, while tens of thousands fled what was left, Becker stayed behind to save as many lives as she could. Read the full piece from Rosa here. Night after night, Ukraine’s fighter jet pilots have taken the battle to an enemy that has “five times more planes”; their aircraft pushed to the limit with no time for pre-take-off checks. The chances of survival in the dogfights in Ukrainian airspace are all too slim. But against the odds, Ukraine’s air force has kept flying a month since the Russian invasion started. Nobody gave the pilots more than a few days. Moscow’s failure to establish air superiority – key if it ever wanted to win a speedy victory – has caused the invasion to stall. Without air cover, Vladimir Putin’s army is stuck, unable to venture beyond entrenched positions without being picked off at will. Read the full story from Robert Mendick here. The United States has not seen evidence of any recent Chinese weapons shipments to its ally Russia as Moscow wages its war in Ukraine, a top US official said today. Washington has raised concerns about Beijing helping Moscow in the midst of the bloody but stalled invasion. ""We have not seen... the provision of military equipment by China to Russia. But of course, this is something we are monitoring closely,"" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said. President Joe Biden held a nearly two-hour call with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping last Friday in which the White House says he warned Xi against bailing out Russia's economy from Western sanctions or assisting Moscow's war effort. Sir Tony Brenton, a former British ambassador to Russia, said he doubts the danger of Vladimir Putin using chemical weapons against Ukraine is ""as high as people have said"". ""What I'm hearing is that it's unlikely because if you've got troops on the ground, then using gas could as easily turn against your troops as for them,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""So I doubt that the danger of him using chemical weapons is as high as people have said, including, I'm afraid, the President of the United States. ""But there is absolutely no doubt that they are very unconstrained in their use of artillery, in their use of missiles, in their use of aircraft, to flatly destroy whatever is in their way - particularly since they've been dramatically slowed down by the very brave Ukrainian resistance over the last four weeks."" Police in Moscow have intensified their drive to crush opposition to Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine by arresting an Interior Ministry technician and a Russian journalist for spreading ""fake news"", writes James Kilner. The authorities also warned Novaya Gazeta, the last remaining liberal newspaper in Russia, that it would be closed if it didn't toe the Kremlin's line. Under a law brought in this month, even referring to a ""war"" in Ukraine could land a journalist or an activist in prison for 15 years. Russia's investigative committee said that journalist Alexander Nevzorov had illegally republished photos of Russian bombing on his YouTube channel.

Lomachenko has opted to remain in the territorial defence force in Belgorod-Dnestrovsky resisting the Russian invasion. The decision to pull out of the scheduled June 5 fight in Australia was made yesterday by the two-time Olympic gold medallist in Beijing and London. ""The fight he's going through right now is much bigger than any boxing match,"" Lou DiBella, Kambosos' manager, told ESPN.

An undercover journalist has exposed the inner workings of Russia's notorious “troll factory” which aims to boost domestic support for Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine by flooding social media with pro-Kremlin comments, writes Nataliya Vasilyeva. Fontanka, the Russian media outlet which first reported on the dedicated group of internet trolls, commissioned a reporter to infiltrate the propaganda operation run out of an office at a converted factory in St Petersburg. The female journalist secured the job after she responded to an advert posted on the Telegram messaging app from a pro-Kremlin group looking to form “the cyber front that will repel attacks by Western-paid Kyiv propagandists”.

Emine Dzheppar, the Deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, has shared footage of a school in Kharkiv destroyed by Russian shelling after rockets hit the area earlier this month. The video clip, which shows a school completely destroyed, was posted on her Twitter. #Kharkiv, #Ukraine.This is one of the schools completely destroyed by #Russian occupants.#Russia wants to leave #Ukrainian children without a future.#RussiaInvadedUkraine#StandWithUkraine#StopRussianAgression#StopPutin #RussianWarCrimes#KharkivTribunal pic.twitter.com/OaM59BF37w — Emine Dzheppar (@EmineDzheppar) March 22, 2022 Rocket strikes have destroyed a railway station in Ukraine's central-eastern Dnipro region, killing one person and damaging rails enough to prevent train passage indefinitely, Governor Valentyn Reznichenko said. The rockets hit a station of the town of Pavlohrad around 60 km (37 miles) east of the regional capital Dnipro. Volodymr Zelensky has said there was ""nothing left"" of the city of Mariupol after weeks of Russian bombardment, as Kyiv appealed to Moscow to allow the evacuation of at least 100,000 people who want to leave. Ukraine has issued increasingly dire warnings about the situation in the encircled southern port city, where officials say residents are without food, medicine, power or running water. Officials said 300,000 civilians were also running out of food in the occupied southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, highlighting what an international aid official said was the breakdown of Ukraine's humanitarian system. ""There is nothing left there. Only ruins,"" Zelenskiy said of Mariupol, which has a peacetime population of 400,000, in a video address to the Italian parliament. Antonio Guterres , the UN chief, has said the war is ""unwinnable"" for Russia. ""For more than two weeks, Mariupol has been encircled by the Russian army and relentlessly bombed, shelled and attacked. For what?"" he tells reporters in New York. ""Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house."" He added that continuing the war was ""morally unacceptable, politically indefensible, [and] militarily nonsensical"". Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian President, has urged Italy to seize a mystery yacht worth some $700 million that has been linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In an address to the Italian parliament, Zelensky said Putin and his wealthy backers often went to Italy on holiday and should have all their assets frozen to put pressure on them to end the invasion of Ukraine. ""Don't be a resort for murderers. Block all their real estate, accounts and yachts - from the Scheherazade to the smallest ones,"" he said, referring to a superyacht that is moored in the Italian port of Marina di Carrara. The owner has never been publicly identified, but there have been insistent rumours in the media that it belongs to Putin or a member of his inner circle. An organisation set up by the imprisoned Alexei Navalny, a fierce Putin critic, released a report on Monday saying it had evidence that the boat belonged to the Russian leader. Ukraine wants China to play a more ""noticeable role"" in halting the war being waged by Russia on its territory and also to become a future guarantor of its security, a senior aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. Andriy Yermak, who heads Zelenskiy's office, also said he expected a dialogue ""very soon"" between Ukraine's leader and Chinese President Xi Jinping, without elaborating. China has resisted pressure from Western countries to condemn Russia's invasion. ""So far we've seen China's neutral position. And, as I said before, we believe that China ... should play a more noticeable role in bringing this war to (an) end and in building up a new global security system,"" Yermak told a virtual news conference organised by the Chatham House think-tank in London. Downing Street has said it remains ""confident"" that sanctions will have a ""significant impact"" on Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov's assets. The Prime Minister's official spokesman was asked for his response to reports that Mr Usmanov may have put many of the UK properties and assets he owned out of the law's reach before being sanctioned over the invasion of Ukraine. ""I've seen those claims reported. I'm not in a position to talk about the veracity of them at this stage,"" he said. He added: ""The sanctions against Usmanov were enacted with immediate effect, he cannot access his assets, it's illegal for any person or company in the UK to do business with him. Asked if he was confident those sanctions would still hit Mr Usmanov's assets, the spokesman said: ""We remain confident these sanctions will have a significant impact on Usmanov. I think of that there's no doubt."" EU companies affected by sanctions against Russia are set to be granted up to €400,000 (£333,000) in state aid. Firms in the agricultural, fishery and aquaculture sectors can get up to €35,000 in direct grants, tax and payment advantages and guarantees, according to a document seen by Reuters. The move to loosen state aid rules to help thousands of companies facing disruptions to their supply chains due to sanctions comes hot on the heels of emergence measures during the pandemic. Companies hit by high gas, electricity prices can get aid not exceeding 30pc of eligible costs up to a maximum of €2m, according to the report. Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov may have put many of the UK properties and assets he owned out of the law’s reach before being sanctioned over the invasion of Ukraine. A spokesman for the billionaire, who has had ties to Arsenal and Everton football clubs, has said most of his property in Britain and his yacht had already been transferred into trusts. Ministers sanctioned Mr Usmanov earlier this month because of his “close links to the Kremlin” as they seek to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for waging war. The Government said he owns Beechwood House in Highgate, north-west London, and estimated it is worth £48 million, as well as the 16th century Sutton Place estate in Surrey. But a spokesman, quoted by the BBC and the Guardian, said most of his UK property and his yacht had already been “long ago transferred into irrevocable trusts”. Sir Keir Starmer has called on the Government to go ""ramp up"" sanctions on Russia to ""cripple"" its ability to function as a country. The Labour leader said Western powers needed to continue their support for Ukraine - including supplying more military equipment - while avoiding direct conflict with Russia. ""Everybody understands why every step has to be taken to prevent this escalating into a direct Nato-on-Russia conflict,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. ""What we need to do is to continue to provide that level of support, continue to support the Ukrainians, and ramp up those sanctions which need to go beyond just isolating Russia. ""They have to cripple its ability to function."" Western officials are wary that Russia may publish further hoax videos containing UK ministers during Thursday's Nato summit to ""maximise effect"". One said: ""The primary objective is to embarrass and sow division, that has been the way these have been used in the past so we would expect the information to be leaked out over time. It might very well be amended to increase its impact. ""I would expect the timing of the releases to be determined to maximise effect. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see that the next step is released during the Nato summit. They will particularly be looking for anything which can be used to drive wedges between allies."" ""It's mainly a strategy of disruption rather than information gathering,"" the official added, though they conceded any information gleaned would be seen as a ""bonus"". Boris Johnson discussed the Ukraine situation with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The pair agreed that Ukraine’s integrity and territorial sovereignty must be respected. The leaders also said that Russia ""needed to adhere to the UN charter"" and both agreed that respect for international law was the only way to ensure global peace and prosperity.

She said that global GDP will remain positive but will be lower due to the war. Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, has urged people to take action against the ""deceitful and thievish"" regime of President Vladimir Putin after being sentenced to nine years in a maximum security prison. The Kremlin critic, one of Mr Putin's most vocal critics, was convicted of fraud and contempt of court. Mr Navalny was also fined 1.2 million roubles (£8,675) and will be moved to a maximum security penal colony. He had already been serving a two-and-a-half year sentence at a prison camp east of Moscow for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up to thwart his political ambitions.

The Justice Secretary said: ""There is strong evidence of war crimes and we believe that those responsible must be held to account"". He added: ""I think we all can agree that trusting Vladimir Putin to keep his word is going to be a very tall order for anyone in the international community, let alone President Zelensky, and there cannot just be a brushing under the carpet of atrocities committed now or in the future."" The deputy head of Kyiv police has accused Russia of using white phosphorus munitions in the city of Kramatorsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy wrote on Facebook: “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk."" He shared a video of a substance burning like the chemical.

This is not assistance. It is kidnapping. — U.S. Embassy Kyiv (@USEmbassyKyiv) March 22, 2022 International news channel Euronews says it has been blocked from broadcasting in Russia due to its Ukraine war coverage. ""We firmly condemn this intolerable restriction imposed on millions ... in Russia who relied on us to get impartial news,"" Euronews said, adding that Russian authorities pulled the channel off air and blocked its websites in Russia. Euronews said it might launch legal action to continue to freely broadcast in the country, one of 160 in which it broadcasts. Russian president Vladimir Putin has intensified a crackdown on media and individuals who fail to toe his line, blocking Facebook and Twitter and signing into law a bill that criminalises the intentional spreading of ""fake"" reports. Euronews said it strongly rejected Russian claims it spread ""fake news"" and that it allegedly called on Russians to protest the war. It said it faced an ""unacceptable threat of criminal liability"" due to the new Russian law. Britain has accused Russia of spreading ""propaganda"" to distract from its atrocities in Ukraine after a second hoax video featuring Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was published. Vladimir Putin's Kremlin has been squarely blamed for the imposters' calls with three Cabinet ministers, as officials appear to struggle to get the clips removed from YouTube. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) described the videos as ""doctored clips"" from the ""Russian state"" and issued warnings against believing their contents. In the second video, released on Tuesday, Mr Wallace seemingly suggests to the caller, who he believed was Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal, that the UK is ""running out of our own"" NLAW anti-tank weapons. ""This video, like most Russian propaganda, is fed out to obscure and manipulate the truth,"" the statement said. Greece's foreign minister Nikos Dendias said on Tuesday that he wants to lead a humanitarian mission into the besieged city of Mariupol in Ukraine where thousands of ethnic Greeks live. Ukraine appealed to Russia on Tuesday to allow humanitarian supplies into Mariupol and to let civilians out of the city, which president Volodymyr Zelensky said had been devastated by Russian bombardments. Dendias said that Greece's priority was to protect unarmed civilians and ethnic Greeks living in Mariupol, adding that he has already notified Ukrainian and Russian authorities over the humanitarian mission. ""I intend to lead this assistance in person,"" he said, adding that he was coordinating with the Red Cross. Mariupol, a city of more than 400,000 before the war, has historically had a sizeable population of ethnic Greeks. Russian forces have stockpiles of ammunition and food that will last for “no more than three days”, the Ukrainian military has claimed. Officials said in an operational report on Tuesday morning that there were also fuel shortages among the Russian military. “Mobilisation is carried out chaotically ... most of them have no military specialty, because they have never served in the military,"" Ukraine's forces said. It came as Ukraine regained the important Kyiv suburb of Makariv by pushing Russian troops out. AFP news agency cited a senior US defence official as saying Moscow has stepped up its military activity, flying 300 sorties in the past 24 hours, in a ""desperate"" bid to turn the tide against the Ukrainian resistance. Russian lawmakers on Tuesday approved legislation imposing jail terms of up to 15 years for publishing false information about Russia's actions abroad, a month on from Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The bill, adopted after a third reading by the lower house State Duma, sets out jail terms and fines for people who publish ""knowingly false information"" about actions abroad by Russian government agencies. If the false information ""caused serious consequences"", it is punishable by up 15 years in jail, a release from the State Duma said. The bill will need the approval of the upper house Federation Council and the signature of President Vladimir Putin before it becomes law. The new bill expands on a law passed earlier in March that allows for up to 15 years in jail for publishing false information about the Russian army. The joint Russian winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, Dmitry Muratov, said Tuesday he will donate his medal to help Ukrainian refugees. Muratov, editor of Russia's leading opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was awarded the 2021 prize alongside Maria Ressa of the Philippines for their efforts ""to safeguard freedom of expression"". Writing on Telegram, he said that he and the newspaper had decided to donate the gold medal to a fund to help Ukrainian refugees.""We ask auction houses that can put this world-famous award on sale to get in contact,"" he wrote. Muratov said he wanted to share the medal ""with peaceful refugees and wounded and sick children who need emergency treatment"". In his message, the journalist also called for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange, the return of the bodies of those killed and provision of humanitarian corridors and aid. Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky has called on Pope Francis to mediate in his country's conflict with Russia to help alleviate human suffering, nearly one month into Moscow's invasion. Mr Zelensky said he had held a telephone call with the Pope and ""told His Holiness about the difficult humanitarian situation and the blocking of rescue corridors by Russian troops."" ""The mediating role of the Holy See in ending human suffering would be appreciated,"" Mr Zelensky wrote on Twitter on Tuesday following the call. Pope Francis has called for an end to the conflict on more than one occasion, and although he has condemned the ""massacre"" in Ukraine he has avoided mentioning Russia by name. At least 117 children have been killed and more than 155 others injured in Ukraine since Russia invaded on February 24, prosecutors say. The Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine said the majority of the fatalities had been reported in or around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv (58) and in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv (40). Some 548 schools have been damaged, including 72 completely destroyed. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation said it had verified a total of 62 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine during the past four weeks of war, killing 15 people and injuring 37 more. #RussianWarCrimes pic.twitter.com/zl7HL7HmBo — Офіс Генерального прокурора (@GP_Ukraine) March 22, 2022 Ukraine appealed to Russia on Tuesday to allow humanitarian supplies into Mariupol and let desperate civilians flee. Mariupol, a port city on the Azov Sea, has been under siege for weeks. City officials say it has no food, medicine, power or running water. ""There is nothing left there,"" Ukraine's president Volodymr Zelensky said. As he was speaking to the Italian parliament on Tuesday, Mariupol city council said Russian forces had dropped two large bombs but gave no further details, as it accused Putin of ""want[ing] to level it to the ground and make it the ashes of dead land"". Ukraine defied an ultimatum for the city to surrender by dawn on Monday as a condition for Russian forces to let civilians leave safely. ""We demand the opening of a humanitarian corridor for civilians,"" deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Tuesday. ""Our military are defending Mariupol heroically. We did not accept the ultimatum. They offered capitulation under a white flag. This is manipulation, a lie."" She said Russian forces were also preventing humanitarian supplies reaching residents of the occupied southern city of Kherson, but gave no further details. A superyacht linked to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich was held up by a protest in support of Ukraine as it tried to dock in Turkey. Activists waved Ukrainian flags from a small boat positioned in front of the oligarch's Solaris vessel, valued at more than £400 million, as it was docking in Bodrum. The protesters were then cleared, allowing the yacht to dock. The 140-metre (460-foot) yacht, which also sails under a Bermuda flag, according to Marine Traffic, docked in Bodrum on Monday afternoon, just over a week after it left Montenegro's Adriatic resort town of Tivat on March 13. A day later, on Tuesday, another yacht linked to Mr Abramovich, The Eclipse, which is one of the world's largest at 162.5 metres (533 feet) long, arrived in the Turkish tourist resort of Marmaris after cruising southeast of the Greek islands of Crete and Rhodes, according to Marine Traffic data. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it would like the negotiations with Kyiv aimed at ending Russia's military action in Ukraine to have more substance. ""There is some kind of process happening. We would like more active and substantial [talks],"" the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Nearly a month into the conflict, there has been little progress in talks between Ukraine and Russia, and the Ukrainian leader Volodymr Zelensky has repeatedly urged direct discussions with his Russian counterpart. He insisted again on Monday that a meeting with Putin ""in any format"" was needed to end the war. He said that any agreement involving ""historic"" changes would be put to a national referendum. But Mr Zelensky warned his country would be ""destroyed"" before it surrenders. Russia is ""considering using"" biological and chemical weapons, Joe Biden has warned as he said Vladimir Putin has his ""back against the wall"". In some of his strongest remarks on the subject to date, the US president accused his Russian counterpart of making fresh ""false flags"", including the claim that the US has biological and chemical weapons in Europe. Russia's defence ministry has accused Kyiv - without providing evidence - of planning a chemical attack against its own people in order to accuse Moscow of using chemical weapons. ""And now he's talking about new false flags he's setting up, including asserting that we in America have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe - simply not true,"" Mr Biden said at a business roundtable event. ""They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That's a clear sign he's considering using both of those."" Four weeks into the invasion, Russian troops have failed to capture any major Ukrainian city with assaults now focused on the besieged southern port of Mariupol. Read more on this warning here Five people have been killed and more than a dozen wounded in Russian strikes on a town in eastern Ukraine, an official in Kyiv said on Tuesday, nearly one month into Moscow's invasion. ""In the Donetsk region, Avdiivka was fired on by artillery and aircraft, the city was razed to the ground. Five civilians were killed and 19 were injured,"" Ukraine's ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said in a statement. She said the attack occurred late on Monday. Avdiivka is located in the east of Ukraine and adjacent to the de-facto capital of pro-Moscow separatists, who wrested control of two self-proclaimed republics in 2014. Ukraine has accused Russian troops of indiscriminately targeting medical facilities, residential areas, and bomb shelters since Moscow sent troops over the borders of its pro-Western neighbour on February 24. Russia denies purposefully targeting civilians and has accused Ukrainian forces of using civilians as human shields. Denisova said in a separate post on Telegram that a Russian tank in the Kharkiv region had targeted a civilian-marked car, killing three adults and a child. Russia's mass-market Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper was hacked on Monday and a false story on Russian military deaths in Ukraine was posted on its site, the newspaper's Kremlin correspondent said on Tuesday. Alexander Gamov, the journalist, insisted the story - which said nearly 10,000 Russian troops had been killed - was fake and was deleted after a few minutes. Before it was removed, the article quoted the Russian Defence Ministry as saying that 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed and 16,153 were injured in more than three weeks of fighting. Gamov provided his explanation for the story on the Kremlin's daily conference call after the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unable to comment on the incident. More on this from our reporters here The Irish Government is planning for the potential arrival of 200,000 Ukrainians into the country as the Russian invasion continues. In a Cabinet meeting later on Tuesday, ministers discuss the crisis in war-torn Ukraine as well as the Irish response. The Irish Government has already welcomed about 10,000 Ukrainian refugees into the country but is preparing for tens of thousands more. The 200,000 figure is based on the expectation that 2 per cent of the 10 million people likely set to flee Ukraine could come to the Republic of Ireland, the Press Association reported. Charlie McConalogue, Ireland's agriculture minister, said plans are ongoing into how to the ""challenge"" of providing adequate accommodation, education, healthcare and employment support for the refugees. The Kremlin on Tuesday rejected US warnings that it may be preparing to conduct cyber attacks in response to Western sanctions and said it does not engage in ""banditry"" at state level. Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that, ""unlike many Western countries, including the United States, Russia does not engage in state-level banditry"". The US warned on Monday there was ""evolving intelligence"" that the Russian government was exploring options for potential cyberattacks, according to a statement from the White House. Russia has released a video of Ben Wallace obtained by state hoaxers purporting to show him discussing Ukraine’s nuclear ambitions. The video was released on YouTube just hours after Downing Street accused Vladimir Putin’s Russia of hoaxing the Defence Secretary and Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, through impostors posing as Ukrainian politicians in calls with the pair. Boris Johnson’s official spokesman warned that the Russians would use doctored versions of the calls in a disinformation campaign to support its “illegal” invasion of Ukraine. In the video of the Microsoft Teams call released and billed as “part 1”, Mr Wallace is seen in a car apparently talking to an impostor posing as Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister.

Joe Biden has said that among the Quad security alliance, only India is ""somewhat shaky"" in acting against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, as the country attempts to balance its ties with Russia and the West. While the other Quad countries - the United States, Japan and Australia - have sanctioned Russian entities or people, India has not imposed sanction or even condemned Russia, its biggest supplier of military hardware. ""In response to his aggression, we have presented a united front throughout the Nato and in the Pacific,"" the US president told a business forum on Monday, referring to the Russian president Vladimir Putin. ""The Quad - with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of these - but Japan has been extremely strong, so is Australia in terms of dealing with Putin's aggression."" Putin says Russia is carrying out ""a special military operation"" to stop the Ukrainian government from committing ""genocide"" - an accusation the West calls a baseless fabrication. A Russian court on Tuesday found the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny guilty on embezzlement charges that could see his prison sentence significantly extended as Moscow seeks to wipe out remaining pockets of dissent. ""Navalny committed fraud - the theft of property by an organised group,"" judge Margarita Kotova said, according to an AFP reporter present at the trial. She also found him guilty on a less severe charge of contempt of court. Navalny, president Vladimir Putin's most vocal domestic critic, was jailed last year on old fraud charges after surviving a poison attack with Novichok nerve agent that he blames on the Kremlin. The trial on Tuesday concerned additional embezzlement and contempt of court charges. Navalny had been tried at the prison colony outside Moscow where he is already serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence. Navalny appeared in the makeshift court wearing his black prison uniform and listened closely as judge Kotova read out the verdict, sometimes smiling. More than 8,000 people were evacuated from conflict zones on Monday, Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said, including about 3,000 from the embattled southern port city of Mariupol. The latest efforts by Ukrainian forces come as the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, hailed those who have fought back against Russia. ""There is no need to organize resistance,"" he said in a video address on Monday night. ""Resistance for Ukrainians is part of their soul."" Russian shelling of a humanitarian corridor wounded four children on a route leading out of Mariupol, he added. Mariupol had a prewar population of about 430,000. Around a quarter were believed to have left in the opening days of the war, and tens of thousands escaped over the past week by way of the humanitarian corridors. Other attempts have been thwarted by the fighting, leaving many trapped. Russia's invasion has driven nearly 3.5 million people from Ukraine entirely, according to the United Nations, with millions more internally displaced. The UN has confirmed over 900 civilian deaths but said the real toll is probably much higher. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands. The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Boryspil, which is close to Boryspil international airport, advised civilians on Tuesday to leave the city if they can because of fighting nearby. Mayor Volodymyr Borysenko said in a video address that there was fighting in the Kyiv region where Boryspil is located. The international airport there, while closed amid the war, is Ukraine's largest. ""There is no need to be in the city now as there is already fighting going on in the area around it. I call on the civilian population to be smart, reach out to our call centre and leave town as soon as an opportunity arises,"" he said. In case you're just joining us, here are six latest developments between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the war. Early on Tuesday, Ukrainian troops forced Russian soldiers out of the Kyiv suburb of Makariv after a fierce battle, Ukraine's Defence Ministry said. The regained territory allowed Ukrainian forces to retake control of a key highway and block Russian troops from surrounding Kyiv from the northwest. But the Defense Ministry said Russian forces battling toward Kyiv were able to partially take other northwest suburbs, Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, some of which had been under attack almost since Russia's military invaded late last month. Just before midnight on Sunday, a missile slammed into Retroville shopping mall, a Kyiv landmark, sending up a huge mushroom cloud and collapsing the building in on itself. Eight people died in the blast, and at least 40 were injured, two of them seriously, hospital officials said. While Russian forces continued with the siege of Mariupol after the southern port city's defenders refused demands to surrender, the Kremlin's ground offensive in other parts of the country advanced slowly or not at all, knocked back by lethal hit-and-run attacks by the Ukrainians. With troops bogged down in many places, Russian president Vladimir Putin's forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine's cities and the civilians living there, killing uncounted numbers and sending millions fleeing. Russian troops are ""largely stalled in place"" after ""yet another day of limited progress"" in their attack on Ukraine, Britain's Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Ukraine said on Tuesday its efforts to evacuate civilians from besieged towns and cities were focused on the city of Mariupol but did not announce any new agreement with Russia to allow safe passage for trapped residents. ""We are focusing on evacuations from Mariupol,"" the deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. She listed a number of places from where buses would try to evacuate civilians but Mariupol was not among them. She also made no mention of any new agreements with Russia on establishing ""humanitarian corridors"" to evacuate civilians. The UN estimates that some 10 million people, a quarter of Ukraine's population, have been driven from their homes. Any use of chemical or biological weapons by Russian forces in Ukraine would ""undoubtedly"" be a war crime, a UK Government minister has said. Joe Biden, the US president, has issued a fresh warning that Russian president Vladimir Putin's ""back is against the wall"" and that he may resort to using his chemical or biological arsenal. Asked if their use would be a war crime, business minister Paul Scully told Sky News: ""Undoubtedly. I think President Biden and the Prime Minister have been really resolute in making sure that we can take every action with the international community to address those crimes of Vladimir Putin. ""This is Vladimir Putin's war, the Kremlin's war against Ukraine. It is not the Russian people's. We have to make sure that we can appeal to the Russian people to bring an end to this."" Russian troops are ""largely stalled in place"" after ""yet another day of limited progress"" in their attack on Ukraine, Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest intelligence update. Several cities are suffering heavy air and artillery bombardment, including Mariupol in the south which Ukrainian forces are successfully defending from Russian occupation. Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 22 March 2022Find out more about the UK government's response: https://t.co/H04Aix2uOs pic.twitter.com/TWVZbPaPTh — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) March 22, 2022 Civilians making the dangerous escape from Ukraine's southern port of Mariupol have described fleeing through street-to-street gun battles and past unburied corpses as Russia tries to bombard the city into submission. Russian president Vladimir Putin's forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine's cities, killing uncounted civilians and displacing a quarter of its population. Those who have made it out of Mariupol told of a devastated city. ""There are no buildings there anymore,"" said 77-year-old Maria Fiodorova, who crossed the border to Poland on Monday after five days of travel. Olga Nikitina, who fled Mariupol for the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where she arrived Sunday, said gunfire blew out her windows, and her apartment dropped below freezing. ""Battles took place over every street. Every house became a target,"" she told the Associated Press news agency. A woman who gave her name as Yulia said she and her family sought shelter in Bezimenne after a bombing destroyed six houses behind her home. ""Everything is destroyed there, dead bodies are lying around,"" she said. ""They don't let us pass through everywhere - there are shootings."" Read more on this here  Russia’s Ministry of Defence appeared to inadvertently reveal that nearly 10,000 of its soldiers have been killed in Ukraine. The figure was contained in a report on March 20 by the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, which has since been deleted from the paper’s site. Komsomolskaya Pravda later claimed to have been hacked and said “inaccurate information” had been published Before it was removed, the article quoted the Russian Defence Ministry as saying that 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed and 16,153 were injured in more than three weeks of fighting. Previously, the Russian military had only admitted that around 500 soldiers had been killed. Read more on this here A superyacht linked to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich docked in the Turkish tourist resort of Marmaris on Tuesday, a port source said, a day after another of his yachts arrived in nearby Bodrum. The Eclipse, which is one of the world's biggest at 162.5m (533 feet) long and sails under a Bermuda flag, arrived in Marmaris after cruising southeast of the Greek islands of Crete and Rhodes, according to Marine Traffic data. The Eclipse is reported to have two helipads, nine decks, a swimming pool and built-in missile defences. The data also showed the superyacht Solaris remained moored in Bodrum, some 80km (50 miles) away, having skirted the waters of European Union countries that have sanctioned the oligarch over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There was no indication that Mr Abramovich was on either of the vessels. He was among several wealthy Russians added last week to a European Union blacklist, and EU governments have acted in recent days to seize yachts and other luxury assets from them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to virtually deliver his address to the Japanese parliament on Wednesday to rally international support for his country's fight against Russian invasion. Japan, unlike in the past, has been acting tough against Russia, in line with other Group of Seven countries, though Tokyo's steps have triggered Moscow's retaliation. A compromise could set a bad precedence in East Asia, where China is increasingly making assertive military actions. Mr Zelensky's speech, expected to be about 10 minutes, will be shown in a meeting room at the lower house - the more powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida belongs to. Foreign dignitaries, including former US.President George W. Bush and former Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, have delivered their addresses in person during visits to Japan as state guests, but an online speech by a foreign leader is unprecedented. Ukrainian leader Volodymr Zelensky said all issues would be on the table if Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to direct talks to end the war, but he warned his country would be ""destroyed"" before it surrenders. He insisted again on Monday that a meeting with Putin ""in any format"" was needed to end the war. ""If I have this opportunity and Russia has the desire, we would go through all the questions,"" he told Ukrainian journalists in an interview published by media outlet Suspilne. ""Would we solve them all? No. But there is chance, that we partially could - at least to stop the war."" He repeated his assertion that Ukraine ""already understood"" it could not join Nato but he said his countrymen would not simply ""hand over"" the capital, the eastern city of Kharkiv, or the heavily bombarded and besieged southern port of Mariupol. ""Ukraine cannot fulfil Russian ultimatums,"" he said. ""We should be destroyed first."" Russian forces shelled along a humanitarian corridor on Monday, wounding four children who were among the civilians being evacuated, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his night-time video address to the nation. He said the shelling took place in the Zaporizhzhia region, the initial destination of those fleeing Mariupol. The Ukrainian Government said that about 3,000 people from Mariupol were evacuated on Monday. Mr Zelensky said he spoke with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and French President Emmanual Macron to coordinate their positions before Western leaders meet on Thursday. ""Our position will be expressed and will be expressed strongly, believe me,"" Mr Zelensky said. Witnesses fleeing the besieged port of Mariupol say they are leaving behind a city that has been almost entirely destroyed by Russian bombardment and heavy fighting. Residents have fled Mariupol not knowing what, if anything, will be left - if and when they return. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was prepared to discuss a commitment from Ukraine not to seek Nato membership in exchange for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine's security. ""It's a compromise for everyone: for the West, which doesn't know what to do with us with regard to Nato; for Ukraine, which wants security guarantees; and for Russia, which doesn't want further Nato expansion,"" Mr Zelensky said late on Monday in an interview with Ukrainian television. He also repeated his call for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Unless he met with Putin, it would be impossible to understand whether Russia even wanted to stop the war, Mr Zelensky said. Mr Zelensky said Kyiv would be ready to discuss the status of Crimea and the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists after a ceasefire and steps towards providing security guarantees. Ukraine's military warned its people on Tuesday to brace for more indiscriminate Russian shelling of critical infrastructure. Russian troops have failed to capture any major Ukrainian city more than four weeks into their invasion, and increasingly are resorting to causing massive destruction to residential areas using air strikes, long-range missiles and artillery. The southern port of Mariupol has become a focal point of Russia's assault and lies largely in ruins with bodies on the streets, but attacks were also reported to have intensified on the second city Kharkiv on Monday. Ukraine's armed forces said in a statement issued on Tuesday that Russian forces were expected to continue to attack critical infrastructure using ""high-precision weapons and indiscriminate munitions”. A luxurious superyacht linked to the owner of Russia's largest steel pipe maker, who is currently under British and European Union sanctions, docked in Gibraltar on Monday and was detained by authorities. Western sanctions on Russian oligarchs over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have triggered an exodus of luxury yachts from Europe in recent weeks, with several heading towards the Maldives, which has no extradition treaty with the United States. Reuters TV footage showed the Axioma yacht (pictured below), believed to be owned by Dmitrievich Pumpyansky, owner of steel group TMK, moored at Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula - flying a Maltese flag. Italy has been urged to seize a superyacht allegedly owned by Vladimir Putin after an investigation by the anti-corruption unit of Alexei Navalny, Russia's jailed opposition leader. Mr Navalny's team said the £500 million yacht was staffed by officers of the Russian Federal Security Service. The vessel, Scheherazade, is undergoing repairs and maintenance at a marina in western Italy. It is said to be the world's most expensive yacht whose owner has not been identified. READ MORE: ‘Vladimir Putin’s superyacht’ faces seizure from Italian marina A superyacht linked to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich docked in the Turkish tourist resort of Bodrum on Monday, after skirting the waters of European Union countries that have sanctioned the oligarch over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Abramovich was among several wealthy Russians added last week to an EU blacklist, and EU governments have acted in recent days to seize yachts and other luxury assets. World governments are seeking to isolate President Vladimir Putin and his allies over Russia's invasion. There was no indication that Mr Abramovich was on the 140-metre (460-foot) yacht Solaris when it docked in Bodrum on Monday afternoon, just over a week after it left Montenegro's Adriatic resort town of Tivat on March 13. Ukraine's leaders on Tuesday accused Russian forces of firing on unarmed protesters in the occupied southern city of Kherson, with videos showing residents fleeing flash-bang grenades and sustained gunfire. President Volodymyr Zelensky led the condemnation: ""Occupiers shot at people who went out peacefully, without weapons, to protest. For freedom - our freedom."" Videos posted on social media and the messaging app Telegram showed citizens gathering in Kherson's Freedom Square, protesting against Russia's recent seizure of the city. Dozens of men and women wrapped in Ukraine's blue-and-yellow flag chanted ""Go home"" and ""Glory to Ukraine"" before stun grenades forced them to flee in panic. Russian soldiers fired multiple volleys of gunfire into the air, with no immediate evidence their rifles were trained directly at civilians. READ MORE: Russian troops open fire on unarmed Ukrainian protesters in occupied city of Kherson Joe Biden, the US President, said Russia used a hypersonic missile to destroy a weapons depot on Saturday ""because it’s the only thing they can get through with absolute certainty"". A US administration official clarified on Monday evening that Mr Biden was confirming Russia's use of such an advanced missile, but noted that the impact of the attack was unknown. Russia has set off an angry reaction from Japan after withdrawing from peace treaty talks. ""Under the current conditions Russia does not intend to continue negotiations with Japan on a peace treaty,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said, citing Japan's ""openly unfriendly positions and attempts to damage the interests of our country"". Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he strongly opposed Russia's decision, terming it ""unfair"" and ""completely unacceptable"". Japan last week announced plans to revoke Russia's most-favoured nation trade status, expand the scope of asset freezes against Russian elites and ban imports of certain products. Russia has also withdrawn from talks with Japan about joint business projects on the Kuril islands and ended visa-free travel by Japanese citizens. Russia and Japan have still not formally ended World War Two hostilities because of the standoff over islands just off Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, known in Russia as the Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories. The islands were seized by the Soviets at the end of the Second World War. Last year, President Vladimir Putin said that both Tokyo and Moscow wanted good relations and it was absurd they had not reached a peace agreement. The US President has told American business leaders they have a ""patriotic obligation"" to harden their systems against cyber attacks. However, Joe Biden underlined that most critical infrastructure in the country is owned and operated by private entities, which cannot be compelled to take specific cyber security measures. ""Owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors,"" Mr Biden said. ""You have the power, the capacity, and the responsibility to strengthen the cybersecurity and resilience of the critical services and technologies on which Americans rely. We need everyone to do their part."" The Biden administration issued ""new warnings that, based on evolving intelligence, Russia may be planning a cyber attack against us"". ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it's coming,"" Mr Biden said. The federal government is doing its part to get ready for potential Russian cyberattacks. We are prepared to help private sector companies with tools and expertise, but it is your decision as to the steps you’ll take and your responsibility to take them. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 22, 2022 The Government has warned US companies about Russian state hackers since long before the country invaded Ukraine. Joe Biden said the US Government would ""continue to use every tool to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, respond to cyber attacks against critical infrastructure"". The US President warned of intelligence pointing to a growing Russian cyber threat and urged American businesses to ""immediately"" prepare defences. ""If you have not already done so, I urge our private sector partners to harden your cyber defences immediately,"" he said. Mr Biden cited ""evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyber attacks"", including in response to Western sanctions over Moscow's launch of the war in Ukraine. ""It's part of Russia's playbook,"" he said. As he surveyed the bomb-wrecked hallway of his seventh-floor flat in Kyiv, Mikhail Moskalenko had just one bitter consolation. The damage to his home might at least settle a long-running argument with his older brother in Moscow, with whom he is already barely on speaking terms. “He’s lived there most of his adult life, and he accepts everything he sees on Russian TV,” the 66-year-old said, rolling his eyes. “He refuses to believe me when I tell him Ukraine is getting bombed because Russian TV hasn’t mentioned it.” The view out of Mr Moskalenko’s window might just convince him. Several hundred yards away, across a patch of newly landscaped parkland, was an apocalyptic scene – a smoking Ground Zero of collapsed masonry that hours earlier, had been one wing of a brand new shopping mall.

3/23/2022,"(Reuters) -EU foreign and defence ministers on Monday agreed a security strategy meant to boost the bloc's military clout when war has returned to Europe, establishing a rapid reaction force with up to 5,000 of troops to be swiftly deployed in a crisis. ""The threats are rising and the cost of inaction is clear,"" the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement, calling the document that sets out European ambitions in defence and security to be reached by 2030 a ""guide to action"". Work on the strategy started in 2020, before the pandemic, a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Ukraine war. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, the EU toughened its language on Moscow. ""The EU needs to be able to protect its citizens and to contribute to international peace and security,"" the bloc said in a statement. ""This is all the more important at a time when war has returned to Europe, following the unjustified and unprovoked Russian aggression against Ukraine, as well as of major geopolitical shifts."" Russia has described its invasion as a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine. At the same time, the EU has made it clear it sees its efforts as complementary to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and not intended to compete with the U.S.-led military alliance as an anchor of Western defence. Germany is ready to provide the core of the EU's new rapid reaction force in 2025, the year it is meant to become fully operational, Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said in Brussels. The force will replace the existing EU battlegroups that the bloc has had since 2007 but never used. Plans for an overhaul gained traction after European countries struggled to handle the chaotic withdrawal from Kabul in August. EU leaders are expected to sign off on the security strategy, referred to as the Strategic Compass, at a summit on Thursday and Friday in Brussels.
