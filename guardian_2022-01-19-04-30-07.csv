1/19/2022,"For all the excitable claims by Matt Moulding, founder, chairman and chief executive of THG, that the e-commerce retailer was a victim last year of a vicious “short attack” from hedge funds, there was a boring explanation for the big tumble in the share price. The stock market, in its collective wisdom, was already in the process last autumn of deciding that the e-commerce and new-tech brigade – think Asos, Boohoo, Darktrace and others – might be a tad overvalued. The reappraisal wasn’t confined to the UK; it was happening in the US too.  And THG, or The Hut Group as it was, gave investors extra reasons to be cautious because its communication around its Ingenuity division, the unit that provides “end-to-end technology solutions” for other people’s brands, was cack-handed. Put simply, investors struggled to see what was revolutionary about a marketing, logistics and distribution set-up. Given that Ingenuity, according to the market’s previous bullish thesis, accounted for about half of THG’s value despite being the divisional tiddler, it was hardly surprising that outsiders had a rethink. You don’t need a conspiracy theory to explain the shares’ descent from 600p from 200p-ish. They now stand at 168p, down 10% on the day, after a trading update that said operating profit margins in 2021 would be slightly below City forecasts. Conventional factors, including foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, were to blame, but it all adds to the impression that THG inhabits the same universe as the rest of the corporate world and should probably be valued as such. THG’s Beauty businesses, centred on the Lookfantastic brand and with revenues of £1.1bn in 2021, are clearly a substantial operation. So, too, the shake and protein division called Nutrition (£659m of revenues). But Ingenuity, with revenues of £194m remains a mystery. Yes, it’s growing rapidly, but until THG provides a breakdown of divisional profits, any valuation is vague. Moulding, wisely, didn’t treat us to another airing of his views on short-selling. Best to keep things that way: if there is hidden value within THG, the stock market is perfectly capable of finding it. On day two of the great GSK adventure, Unilever’s shares fell another 4%. One worry is that the company, led by chief executive Alan Jope, will end up overpaying for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products division. Another is that it will walk away and overpay for something else. Jope, after all, was clear on Monday that, whatever happens, Unilever’s strategy is to expand “materially” in the territory of “health, beauty and hygiene”. Investors’ nerves won’t be helped by credit rating agency Fitch’s contribution. A purchase of the GSK business, “or possibly any other large target”, would raise debt levels to the point where the current A rating on Unilever’s debt is threatened, it said. Unilever has a view on the debt point, of course: it would sell some or all of its food business, which is stuffed with excellent brands such as Ben & Jerry’s and Hellmann’s. It has no intention of running with sky-high borrowings for long. But there is an issue of time and sequencing here. If the food business is worth roughly £50bn – the same as the rejected offer for the GSK unit – how quickly could that sum be turned into cash? A single buyer looks unlikely, which would imply a series of sales. As it happens, Unilever sold at decent prices in the recent past when disposing of its spreads business and then the PG Tips tea operation, but neither sale happened quickly. Targeting the GSK unit is entirely reasonable, as argued here yesterday: the fit is good. But the journey to a reinvented Unilever is starting to look extremely complicated. “Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke’. It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships,” writes Larry Fink, big boss of the $10tn asset manger BlackRock, in his annual “Dear CEO” letter. There’s nothing particularly new or groundbreaking in his view. Fink was late – disgracefully so, many would say – to embrace the idea that long-term returns require a long-term perspective, and that profit-seeking companies should operate with a sense of duty to wider society and the planet. But he’s been arguing along those lines for a few years now. So why does he feel the need to reject the charge of being woke? Only because he’s getting heat from US conservatives. In the UK – and, indeed, in the mainstream fund management in the rest of Europe – Fink’s version of stakeholder capitalism would be seen as unthreatening and middle-of-the-road. Over here, almost nobody is calling him radical or woke.",News/Business,Little ingenuity needed to spot the weakness of THG | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/18/thg-ingenuity-e-commerce
1/19/2022,"The Chelsea Women manager, Emma Hayes, has said she fulfilled a childhood dream in winning a Fifa Best award on Monday night – and that her son, Harry, asked whether it was “for being the best mummy”. Hayes won the women’s coach award and was following proceedings from home via a link when the announcement was made in Zurich. “The funniest thing about it all is my son came downstairs and he said: ‘Mummy, you’ve won an award – is that for being the best mummy?’” a beaming Hayes said. “Dream fulfilled, and in my son’s eyes, I won an award for being mummy of the year.  “When they called my name out, as everyone knows I was completely shocked,” she added of her open-mouthed reaction that went viral. “The first thing I thought about was that little kid in the orange flats kicking the ball against the wall, commentating on myself in a cup final or leading a team. As a little girl I dreamed of these things. I’ve just had a dream turn into a reality, and then I felt instantly embarrassed.” Hayes’s embarrassment comes from the fact that, while appreciative, she does not see too much in individual awards in a team sport. Chelsea won a domestic treble in 2021 and reached the Champions League final. “I feel like everybody deserves it – an individual award for a coach seems mental to me,” she said. Being a role model, too, feels a little alien. “When you are that person, trust me, words like role model or inspiration or pioneer get used a lot and you don’t really understand it,” she said. “It’s not because I’m ignorant but because I’m doing a job I love every day. When you discover you won #TheBest FIFA Women’s Coach Award…the absolutely delightful reaction from @ChelseaFCW’s Emma Hayes 🤗 pic.twitter.com/kCqeTCpM2a “It’s all of us that will influence the next level for the game, in terms of making sure people are involved, invested and influenced by it, that the base becomes even bigger. We know when we first started there were only a few of us. The fact we’re more front and centre across the board, there’s more regular coverage and there’s more back-page stories, it’s just helping the game. I’m one of those parts to that. That movement for me is far more powerful than any other individual award.” Helping to challenge her is the increased competitiveness of Women’s Super League teams. West Ham, Chelsea’s opponents in Wednesday’s Continental League Cup quarter-final, are one of many performing better than ever. “It’s great,” Hayes said. “It’s what I’ve always wanted for the league. I always feel when I watch West Ham play that they know how to stay in the game. I think Olli Harder has done a great job with them. “But what a great job so many teams are doing: Rehanne Skinner at Tottenham, Kelly Chambers to recover Reading, Mark Skinner, Manchester United, I think he’s doing an amazing job. They’re making the league interesting.” A noticeable difference in the WSL compared with other leagues is the number of female managers in charge, with half the teams managed by women. Tottenham and Chelsea also have female former WSL head coaches as assistants. “I’m proud of the league for that,” said Hayes. “The NWSL has a lot to learn in my opinion, as does the French league, the German league, the Spanish league, about appointing women. This isn’t about just appointing women into jobs. It’s just demonstrating that healthy diversity is important, at any level, for the players, for the whole sport. “So I’m very proud of all of them for what they’re doing because I think they’re raising the bar for the sport, and I become a better coach with competition, so I’m really enjoying the difficult games week in, week out.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s Emma Hayes reveals Fifa award brings back childhood memories,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/chelsea-emma-hayes-reveals-fifa-award-brings-back-childhood-memories
1/19/2022,"A pastor from a megachurch in Tulsa, Oklahoma, faced a wave of criticism online over video of him rubbing spit on a worshipper’s face. During a sermon on Sunday, Michael Todd, a 34-year-old lead pastor at Transformation church, spat into his hand twice.  “Receiving vision from God might get nasty,” he said, before turning to the man on the stage. The incident came about 40 minutes into a two-hour service, when Todd discussed Mark 8:22-25, a Bible passage in which Jesus restores a blind man’s sight in the village of Bethsaida by rubbing spit on to his eyes. The parishioner in Tulsa was identified as Todd’s brother, Brentom Todd. When Todd rubbed his hands on to his brother’s face, the audience let out an audible gasp. Todd responded: “How you just reacted is how the people in your life will react when God is doing what it takes for the miracle.” As clips went viral, Todd faced a wave of criticism online. Many condemned his actions as an ill-advised publicity stunt at a time when Covid-19 cases continue to rise across the US. Just in the last 14 days, according to the New York Times Covid-19 tracker, cases rose by 287% in Oklahoma alone. “The acts that Pastor Mike Todd committed today during his Sunday service Transformation Church were absolutely disgusting,” one user wrote on the church’s Facebook page. “I usually am not quick to attack people online but he has got to be held accountable for rubbing his spit in another person’s face. Pastors have to be held to a higher standard.” Another wrote: “I found your demonstration demeaning and gross. Your message was loud and clear without rubbing your spit all over a brother’s face.” On Twitter, a user wrote: “What is the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] going to do about Mike Todd?” Todd tweeted an apology, saying in a video his actions were “disgusting” and a “distraction”. He was passionate about delivering hope to people, he said, “so much so that I try to do extreme things”. “That was a distraction to what I was really trying to do,” he said. “I was really trying to make the word come alive and for people to see the story. But yesterday it got too live, and I own that.” Todd went on to say that he had called his brother. “He was bald before I spit on him,” he said, “and he’s still bald today. So no miracles here … so next time I’ll rethink and do something differently.” Todd has previously worked with the Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt, to hold a statewide day of prayer for those affected by Covid-19.",News/US news,Oklahoma pastor faces criticism for rubbing spit on parishoner’s face,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/18/oklahoma-pastor-faces-criticism-for-rubbing-spit-on-parishoners-face
1/19/2022,"The body of a four-year-old Belgian boy has been found in the Netherlands after he was abducted by his babysitter, who it emerged has a previous conviction for abuse that led to the death of a two-year-old child. A police search found Dean Verberckmoes, who had been missing for four days, at the back of a car park near a theme park on an artificial island off the Dutch Zeeland coast on Sunday night.  The discovery followed the arrest and questioning of Dave De Kock, 34, who had been due to return the boy to his grandmother last Thursday. De Kock had been arrested at 2.15pm on Sunday after reports from residents in Gorinchem, in North Brabant, of an intoxicated man peering into houses. It has been reported that De Kock was initially unable to answer questions but later led detectives to where he is suspected of dumping Dean’s body. De Kock, who was described as a “cuddly uncle” to Dean, had regularly looked after the boy for his mother, Elke Verberckmoes, 39, who is receiving treatment for depression. Verberckmoes told Belgian media outlets that she had trusted De Kock entirely and had no idea that he had been convicted in 2008 and sentenced to 10 years in prison for “inhumane acts resulting in the death” of two-year-old Miguel Van Kriekinge. De Kock’s prison sentence ended in December 2018. On Sunday, Verberckmoes had told local media: “Dave would take care of my son, which he did every Wednesday. They get along very well and Dean considers him something of a cuddly uncle. There was no indication that he had other plans this time.” Dean’s last words to his mother before being taken were, “Goodbye mum, I’m going to miss you”. The boy was last been seen by Verberckmoes on Wednesday when De Kock dropped her off at a hospital in Sint Niklaas, a city near Antwerp, where she was staying for scheduled treatment. De Kock then drove the boy to his house in Kerkstraat in Sint-Gillis-Waas where he lived with his girlfriend. On Thursday, De Kock told the boy’s grandmother that Dean wanted to stay an extra night with him. Over the next few days, De Kock maintained contact via text messages with Dean’s mother but communication appears to have ended on Saturday at which point the police were alerted. In response to public anger over the case, Belgium’s justice minister Vincent Van Quickenborne said legislation allowing judges to order the surveillance of offenders after prison had been enacted too late to apply to him. De Kock’s previous conviction had seen him befriend his victim’s mother Sandra Verbeek, 35, whom he had lived with for four weeks before her son’s death. A court heard from psychiatric experts that De Kock would react in a “sadistic way” when he was upset. In explanation of the fatal injuries to Verbeek’s child, De Kock had said he had played “brutal games” with the boy while under the influence of drugs. A judge ruled that the injuries discovered to the boy’s face, torso and arms, “could in no way be explained by brutal games”. Dean’s body was found by police on Neeltje Jans, an artificial island popular with cyclists and walkers during the summer but largely unpopulated in the winter. The suspect’s Peugeot was discovered at the grounds of a car breaker.",News/World news,Body of missing four-year-old Belgian boy found in Netherlands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/body-of-missing-four-year-old-belgian-boy-found-in-netherlands
1/19/2022,"“Of all things in the world, people are the most precious,” Mao Zedong said soon after taking power, believing China needed more soldiers and workers. The advent of peace saw the population rocket from 540 million to 969 million over the next three decades. Authorities abruptly switched to curbing births and brutally implementing the “one-child” policy. These days, most Chinese couples are curtailing their families – or going without – by choice. The population now stands at 1.4 billion; a sixth of the global total. But last year’s birthrate was the lowest since 1949, and the rate of population growth the lowest since the Great Famine six decades ago. The pandemic has seen dramatic drops in births in many places. But in China, the shift is part of a pronounced long-term trend. Several experts believe that last year marked the population peak.  Numerous Asian countries face a population crisis; South Korea has the world’s lowest fertility rate at 0.9%, far below China’s rate of 1.3%. (The replacement rate is around 2.1%.) But Chinese leaders continued to impose tight restrictions long after demographers urged them to ease off. Relaxing the rules – permitting couples two children, and last year three – came too late. Now Beijing is scrambling to persuade people to have more children (though not in Xinjiang, where there are reports of Uyghur women being forced to have abortions and sterilisations, and the birthrate has almost halved). About one-third of the population is predicted to be aged over 60 by 2050. A 2019 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the state pension fund was likely to run out of money by 2035. Some analysts suggest this demographic timebomb may prevent China from overtaking the US as the world’s largest economy. The problem is exacerbated by China’s heavily skewed sex ratio at birth, which was worsened by the one-child policy: the country now has 30 million more men than women. Young women also seem to be opting out of marriage: a survey of 18- to 26-year-old urban residents by the Communist Youth League found that 43.9% of women had no intention of getting married or were unsure whether it would happen. The discrimination mothers face at work appears to be a significant disincentive. The government has banned expensive private tutoring and promised increased affordable childcare; such policies may appeal given growing concerns about the cost of living. But a recent report suggested that Beijing would have to spend around 5% of GDP on incentives if it wanted to see the fertility rate reach 1.6%. The concern is that the state may give up on persuasion. In a system overwhelmingly run by men, the declining fertility rate and concerns about unwed men have already led to the promotion of conservative “family values”. The state feminist organisation has for years encouraged young women to focus on marriage and motherhood. More recently, the government has introduced a 30-day cooling off period for divorces. Now men are reporting finding it harder to obtain vasectomies, and recent guidelines saying local governments should try to reduce the number of abortions for “non-medical reasons” have sparked fears of reduced access. There are not only more humane but more effective ways of dealing with the falling birthrate. China has no appetite for immigration. But it should redouble its pursuit of increased automation, household registration reforms, better rural education and a higher retirement age, with better conditions for workers. Beijing seems to see its population as a commodity to be managed. But the abuses of the one-child era should not be replaced by pro-natalist infringements of people’s rights.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on China’s baby bust: let people choose | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/18/the-guardian-view-on-chinas-baby-bust-let-people-choose
1/19/2022,"Diego Carlos appears to have succeeded in forcing a move from Sevilla to Newcastle United and could be registered for Eddie Howe’s team in time to make his debut during Saturday’s vital Premier League game at Leeds United. Shortly after the 28-year-old Brazilian centre-back submitted a formal transfer request, Sevilla – who had rejected two Newcastle bids – appeared to concede defeat in their attempts to retain him and began advanced negotiations over a potential deal in the region of £30m.  With Newcastle second bottom and having won only one game all season while conceding 43 Premier League goals, Howe has identified signing at least one central defender as an imperative. When Lille rejected his attempt to buy their 21-year-old Netherlands defender Sven Botman, Newcastle swiftly switched their attention to Carlos, who would need to be registered by midday on Friday to be involved at Leeds. Having begun his career in Brazil with Deportivo Brasil, Carlos moved to Portugal, playing for Estoril, and then France before joining Sevilla from Nantes in 2019, helping the team currently second in La Liga win the Europa League in 2020. He would be Howe’s third signing, joining the England right-back Kieran Trippier, acquired from Atlético Madrid for £15m, and the centre-forward Chris Wood, a £25m buy from Burnley.",Sport/Football,Newcastle close in on £30m deal for Sevilla defender Diego Carlos ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/newcastle-close-in-on-30m-deal-for-sevilla-defender-diego-carlos
1/19/2022,"English water companies have got used to pumping raw sewage into the sea and rivers. An investigation launched last year by the regulator, Ofwat, and the Environment Agency, is a chance to put things right. But there are worrying signs that this opportunity to shine a light is in danger of being missed. The refusal by the Environment Agency to reveal which 2,000 sewage treatment works in England are being looked at, and whether this will lead to delays in dealing with new complaints, raises questions about its commitment to openness. That the investigation is happening at all is due to huge efforts by campaigners. Concern over sewage dumps has been rising in response to water companies’ failure to tackle a longstanding problem that increased extreme weather, due to climate change, is expected to make worse. Discharges of untreated waste into the sea or rivers are supposed to happen only in exceptional circumstances, to reduce flood risk. Over recent years, it has become clear that rules are being routinely flouted by an industry that puts profits before environmental stewardship. At the same time, the Environment Agency’s record for punishing breaches has sharply declined following budget cuts. A report from a committee of MPs last week drew attention to the poor condition of rivers and called for a step change.  Last summer, Southern Water was fined a record £90m for pouring between 16bn and 21bn litres of raw sewage into protected coastal waters for financial gain. It was the worst environmental crime in the Environment Agency’s 25-year history. Yet the House of Commons last year stopped short of imposing a legal duty on water companies to stop releasing raw sewage, after ministers rejected a Lords amendment. The nine privatised water companies, which are regional monopolies, are instead obliged to make only “progressive reductions” in the amount they pollute. Now the approach of the Environment Agency to requests for information from the campaign group Fish Legal suggests an unwillingness to hold the industry publicly to account. Not every company has the same repulsive track record as Southern Water. But the problem is systemic and cannot be blamed on one weak or unscrupulous board of directors. Over 11 years, £16.9bn has been awarded to water company shareholders in dividends, while debt has rocketed to £48bn. Bosses are rewarded for failure: Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent, was awarded £1.9m in bonuses in 2020, a year when the company poured untreated waste into waterways on nearly 61,000 occasions. It doesn’t have to be like this. Scottish Water is publicly owned, charges less, and since 2002 has invested nearly 35% more, per household, than privatised English water companies in the infrastructure upgrades that are needed to limit pollution. Welsh Water is also non-profit. The English industry’s dismal track record makes renationalisation the obvious answer. In the short term, the bodies with responsibility for regulating water must toughen up. A five-year plan from Ofwat, expected soon, must put much stronger emphasis on environmental protection. And when the public seek information about which water companies are failing, they must be given it.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on water pollution: come clean on sewage | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/18/the-guardian-view-on-water-pollution-come-clean-on-sewage
1/19/2022,"My father, Colin Ward, who has died aged 90, spent much of his working life as a herdsman on farms in the home counties and Norfolk, but also had a period as an unwitting ‘virgin soldier’ during a violent interlude in Singapore in the early 1950s. Colin was born, and grew up in, the village of Kimpton in Hertfordshire. His father, Tom, was a tailor and his mother, Drusilla (nee Kirby), a housewife. Colin left St Mary’s secondary modern school in Welwyn at 14 and worked as a clerk in the accounts department of the plastics division of ICI at Kimpton Hoo, until, aged 18, he was called up to do his national service.  After basic training he embarked on a six-week journey to British Malaya, and then found himself based in Singapore in early 1950, from where he fought in the Malayan Emergency. Much later in life Colin told many stories of that time. He was on a bus one day which was attacked, and a woman sitting behind him was shot and killed. On another occasion his train was ambushed, and he recalled watching a line of dum-dum bullets making holes in the carriage above his head as he lay on the floor. The soldier sleeping in the bunk above him was hit and died instantly. The author Leslie Thomas did his national service at the same time and in the same field of conflict as Colin, and Thomas’s novel, The Virgin Soldiers, had many echoes of Colin’s own experiences, although he claimed not to recognise the more salacious aspects of the book. Colin was discharged in 1951, returning to the UK on the Empire Windrush. He briefly considered rejoining the army, for the camaraderie, but instead moved to his sister’s farm at Ashdon, Essex, where he worked as a herdsman. He met Anne Williamson, the daughter of the village shopkeeper, at his 21st birthday party, and they married in 1954. Thereafter Colin worked as a herdsman on various farms around the home counties until 1967, when he moved his young family to Norfolk to look after the cattle at Norfolk College of Agriculture (now Easton College) near Norwich and to give on-the-job training to a new generation of herdsmen and women. Colin left farming in the mid-1970s, needing a higher wage to support his growing family. He worked first as a machine setter, then as a process worker at May & Baker in Norwich, and finally as a landscape gardener until his retirement. Anne died in 2007. He is survived by their four children and five grandchildren.",News/Environment,Colin Ward obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/colin-ward-obituary
1/19/2022,"Microsoft’s planned takeover of Activision Blizzard puts the tech company at the centre of two big issues facing the sector: the metaverse and Washington’s determination to rein in big tech. The metaverse is where the physical and digital worlds come together, although it is very much at the concept stage. The idea is that you will put on a virtual reality headset and a digital representation of yourself – an avatar – will interact with others at work and play in a combination of virtual and augmented reality.  Microsoft has made clear with its planned $68.7bn (£50.6bn) acquisition of Activision Blizzard that it expects gaming to be a key feature of this new world, with Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chair and chief executive, saying on Tuesday that gaming “will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms”. If the metaverse is an immersive world, then gaming – as exemplified by titles such as Roblox and (Microsoft-owned) Minecraft – already offers that experience to its participants. Mark Zuckerberg is so convinced by the potential of the metaverse concept that he changed the corporate name of his empire from Facebook Inc to Meta. If his recent announcement that his company is spending $10bn a year on the metaverse seemed like a gamble, Microsoft has just staked nearly $70bn on it. Of course there are immediate benefits for Microsoft, which will gain access to Activision’s 390 million monthly users and huge gaming franchises such as Call of Duty and Warcraft. Gaming, Metaverse or not, is a $180bn global market already, according to research firm Newzoo. Microsoft owns the Xbox gaming platform and Activision’s games and talent will help the company in its competitive battle with Sony’s PlayStation as well as gaming offerings from Meta’s VR platform, Oculus. Despite big brands like Xbox and the Halo game, Microsoft’s big earners are business-focused: cloud computing (ie providing services like storage space over the internet and sparing you having to invest in hardware) and PC software. As analysts at Wedbush Securities said of the deal on Tuesday, Microsoft’s consumer strategy has “been on a treadmill approach”. Not any more. But the opinion of regulators and lawmakers matters on this deal. Microsoft is one of the big three console makers and owns games-making studios such as Mojang, the creator of Minecraft. If this deal goes ahead it would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest gamesmaker and it will be noted by regulators, says David Wagner, analyst and portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “This will get a lot of looks from a regulatory standpoint.” The US competition watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission, is now under the leadership of Lina Khan, who has underlined her interest in tackling the big tech players by successfully lodging a renewed complaint against Meta. Khan is a Joe Biden appointee and big tech has few friends among Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Microsoft is making a big move in a hostile environment.",News/Technology,Microsoft’s Activision plan shows gaming will be at heart of metaverse,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/18/microsofts-activision-plan-shows-gaming-will-be-at-heart-of-metaverse
1/19/2022,"Competitors at the Beijing Winter Olympics will face an “Orwellian surveillance state” in China and could put themselves in danger if they speak out in support of the Uyghur Muslims, human rights and athlete advocacy groups have said.  In a blunt message before the Games that begin on 4 February they also warned athletes not to expect the International Olympic Committee to protect them if they stood up for human rights or were critical of the Chinese authorities. Yaqiu Wang, a researcher on China for Human Rights Watch, said the disappearance of the tennis player Peng Shuai was “a good indicator of what could possibly happen” if athletes spoke out. “Chinese laws are very vague on the crimes that can be used to prosecute people’s free speech,” she said. “People can be charged with picking quarrels or provoking trouble. There are all kinds of crimes that can be levelled at peaceful, critical comments. And in China the conviction rate is 99%.” Dr Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch, said: “One of the features of the 2008 Games was the authorities’ use of what was then considered high technology, but that pales in comparison to the Orwellian surveillance state. “The authorities use across the country now where tools like AI and predictive policing, Big Data databases, extensive surveillance of social media platforms, keeps people from engaging in certain kinds of conversations. Anyone who’s travelling to the country for these games – journalists, athletes, coaches – needs to be aware that this kind of surveillance could affect them.” Meanwhile, the US Nordic skier Noah Hoffman, who competed at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics, has said the American team was telling its athletes not to talk about human rights for their own safety. “Athletes have an amazing platform and ability to speak out, to be leaders in society and yet the team is not letting them field questions on certain issues ahead of these Games,” he said. “That makes me upset. “But my advice to athletes is to stay silent because it would threaten their own safety and that’s not a reasonable ask of athletes. They can speak out when they get back.” That message was echoed by Rob Koehler, director general of the most high-profile international sports athlete advocate organisation, Global Athlete, who urged the IOC to announce it would support competitors who spoke in favour of human rights. “It is absolutely ridiculous that we’re telling athletes to be quiet,” he said. “But the IOC has not come out proactively to indicate that it will protect them. “Silence is complicity and that’s why we have concerns. So we’re advising athletes not to speak up. We want them to compete, and use their voice when they get home.”",Sport/Sport,Athletes warned about speaking out against China at Winter Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/athletes-warned-speaking-out-china-winter-olympics
1/19/2022,"My friend Tony Birtill, who has died aged 67 of cancer, was a fluent Irish speaker and teacher based in Liverpool. He was a regular contributor to Irish-language publications including Foinse, Lá, Beo and Tuairisc, and broadcasted frequently on Radio Merseyside, RTÉ News, Raidió na Gaeltachta and Radio Ulster. In 1990 he re-established the now thriving Gaelic League (Conradh na Gaelige) branch in Liverpool. On Tony’s initiative the Frongoch memorial was established in 2002, marking the site in north Wales where participants in the Easter Rising had been interned. In 2018 Tony advised on translating the phrase “You’ll never walk alone” into Irish for use on a Spirit of Shankly banner at Anfield football ground.  Tony’s book A Hidden History: The Irish Language in Liverpool (2020) brought to light the considerable numbers of Irish speakers in the city in the 19th century, the contribution Irish speakers from Merseyside made to the language revival movement, and the prevalence of words and expressions of Irish origin still found in the Liverpool dialect. Born in Liverpool, Tony was the son of Julia (nee Daly), a nurse from Garlow Cross, Co Meath, and Joe Birtil, a chemistry teacher. He developed a keen interest in Irish from an early age after having heard it spoken by his mother and among the Christian Brothers at his school, Cardinal Godfrey, in Liverpool. After graduating in economics and economic history at University of East Anglia in 1975, Tony did his teacher training at the Institute of Education, University of London. He taught economics initially at Harlow college, Essex, then at Skelmersdale college, Lancashire. It was in the early 1980s that he took up study of the Irish language in earnest, and it was at these evening classes in Liverpool that I met him. After gaining A-level and teaching qualifications, Tony began teaching Irish at the Liverpool Irish Centre, Liverpool University Continuing Education and other venues. He also wrote regularly for the Irish Post during this time. A qualified mountain leader, Tony guided walks – conducted mainly in Irish – at the Oideas Gael school in Donegal each summer, and they became a significant attraction in the school’s programme. According to one participant, “Tony’s walks in Gleann were legendary because of his deep interest in and knowledge of local flora and fauna, archaeology, the rugged landscape, the remote setting, the language and culture.” Tony was a socialist, republican, trade unionist and environmentalist. He was on the committees for the Great Hunger commemoration, the Liverpool 1916 commemoration and the Liverpool Irish festival. Always good company, he was renowned for his sense of humour and loud laugh. He remained dedicated to his local area, campaigning to maintain rights of way and cycle routes, and continued teaching Irish classes in Liverpool until shortly before he died. Tony is survived by his wife, Grace, a special needs teacher, and his son, Liam, from a former relationship with Liz Hanson.",News/Education,Tony Birtill obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/18/tony-birtill-obituary
1/19/2022,"An ex-partner of KPMG sought to portray himself as negligent because it was the “lesser of two evils”, a tribunal heard today, as former employees of the big four accounting firm gave evidence about its audit of collapsed outsourcer Carillion. The tribunal is investigating claims made by the Financial Reporting Council, which regulates accountants, that KPMG and its staff misled FRC inspectors by forging documents in relation to its work on the accounts of Carillion and a software company, Regenersis.  On Tuesday, the FRC published a settlement with KPMG and its former employee Stuart Smith over the 2014 Regenersis audit. Smith will pay a fine of £150,000 and is barred from accountancy for three years, while KPMG is liable for a sanction that will be determined after the tribunal. As the tribunal continued on Tuesday, much of the evidence focused on KPMG’s “misleading” disclosures to the FRC over its audit of Carillion. Carillion collapsed with £7bn of debts in January 2018, resulting in 3,000 job losses and causing chaos across hundreds of its projects – including two big hospitals, schools, roads and even Liverpool FC’s stadium, Anfield. KPMG has admitted misleading the FRC during routine checks on the quality of its audit but former staff members accused of misconduct by the FRC disagree over who was to blame. They include Peter Meehan, one of the most senior staff members, known as partners. He was suspended by the company in 2019 and left in 2021. On Tuesday, Meehan repeatedly denied being involved in the alleged falsification of documents. He had earlier told the tribunal that he was “shocked and devastated and angry” to find that members of his team had allegedly duped the regulator. Fionn Pilbrow, acting for one of Meehan’s team, Richard Kitchen, said Meehan knew about the alleged forgery of documents but “sought to paint a picture of yourself as just a negligent auditor” because it was the “lesser of two evils”. “Your evidence now is untrue and like all the evidence you’ve given, trying to distance yourself from your team,” said Pillbrow. Meehan denied this. The FRC alleges that Kitchen, an audit manager of Carillion, edited a key formula in a spreadsheet handed to the FRC, to increase a threshold for scrutiny of contracts from £300,000 to £1.5m. The change ruled out a large number of contracts that would have been flagged, and avoided uncomfortable questions on why more contracts had not been scrutinised, the FRC alleged. Kitchen strongly denies all wrongdoing. Pilbrow has argued that Kitchen was following Meehan’s directions, and that he did not knowingly make false representations to the regulators. Alistair Wright, a KPMG group senior manager working under Meehan, has already admitted “serious misconduct”. But lawyers for Meehan have argued that he was a “patsy” for actions carried out by members of his team.
