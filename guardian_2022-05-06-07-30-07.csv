5/6/2022,"Disgruntled Liberal voters are “voting with their feet” to support the so-called teal independents, because the influence of the party’s moderate wing at the federal level was “diminished and diminishing”, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull is set to say. Describing the 2022 Australian election campaign in a speech he is to give to the Washington Harvard Club on Friday, Turnbull says the rise of the independents is “the most interesting part of the election” because “if more of these ‘teal’ 10 independents win, it will mean the capture of the Liberal Party will be thwarted by direct, democratic action from voters. People power, you might say.” “Since my deposition in 2018 it is fair to say that the liberal, or moderate, voices have been marginalised and their influence is much diminished and diminishing – especially on the toxically controversial issue of climate change where the political right, supported by Murdoch’s media, have opposed effective action for many years,” he said. “So what does a traditional voter for, say, the Liberal Party in Australia or the Republican Party in the US do if they think their party has moved too far to the right? They can vote for the other side – Labor in Australia, Democrats in the US – but that may be a bridge too far … “In Australia, the existence of preferential voting opens up another option and we are seeing it play out in this election. In a number of hitherto safe Liberal seats, residents have organised to support small “l” liberal independent candidates who are typically progressive on climate and social issues, but more conservative than Labor on economic issues. “If such an independent can get enough primary votes to finish second behind the Liberal incumbent, and if that incumbent’s vote is reduced to about 40% or less, then the independent will probably win on the preferences of Labor, the Greens and other independents. “In many respects this may be the most interesting part of the whole election, because if more of these ‘teal’ independents win, it will mean the capture of the Liberal Party will be thwarted by direct, democratic action from voters. People power, you might say.” Turnbull dismissed Scott Morrison’s claim that a hung parliament would result in “chaos”, saying: “Of course the big parties’ arguments against independents is always the same – instability, chaos and so on. But in truth, many parliaments, including in Australia, have operated with stability and good effect with major parties requiring the support of independents or minor parties to pass legislation and, in fact, in our Senate that has almost always been the case.” In a subsequent interview on ABC radio he denied that he was “urging” a vote for teal independents, and added that neither major party was in a position to say independents were the cause of instability in Australian politics, given the last decade of leadership ructions on both sides. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Turnbull has previously declined to say whether he would vote for the Liberal Dave Sharma or the independent Allegra Spender in his former seat Sydney seat of Wentworth. Peter Dutton last year described Turnbull as “totally consumed by hatred and this desire to bring down the Morrison government”. Asked about the defence minister on ABC radio, Turnbull said he was a “headkicker”. Teal independents are running in Turnbull’s old seat of Wentworth, in North Sydney, Mackellar, Goldstein, Kooyong and Cowan. Liberals believe some of these seats will fall on 21 May. Turnbull’s comments on Friday follow a similar intervention last December. At the launch of an integrity project from the Accountability Round Table he said the rise of climate-focused independents meant disaffected Liberal voters were “now getting the opportunity to vote for the sort of candidates that share their values”. “I don’t think coalition governments are a bad idea – I don’t think working with crossbenchers is a bad idea,” the former prime minister said last December. “I can make a case for you that the worst thing that happened to John Howard in politics was getting a majority in the Senate. “The blood rushed to the head and he decided to introduce WorkChoices … he had no electoral mandate for it whatsoever, he did it because he could do it, and that was a major factor in his defeat in 2007.” Turnbull said more representative diversity in the parliament meant prime ministers had to explain their positions to other actors in the political system. “Once you start treating people with respect, you get a better result,” he said. “There is a tendency for people to tell leaders what they want to hear – as a leader you have to work very hard to ensure people tell you what they really think. So it’s good to have to deal with, whether it is a crossbench in the House or the Senate, where you have to actually … explain your case.” “I think a bit more diversity in our parliaments would actually make a very big difference.”",News/Australia news,Malcolm Turnbull says Australians are ‘voting with their feet’ to support teal independents,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/malcolm-turnbull-says-australians-are-voting-with-their-feet-to-support-teal-independents
5/6/2022,"Giovanni van Bronckhorst immediately set his sights on winning the Europa League after Rangers sealed a Seville final meeting with Eintracht Frankfurt by beating RB Leipzig on a famous evening at Ibrox. “We will prepare well and try to create another proud moment for this club,” said the Rangers manager. “We don’t have to do anything different in terms of preparation than we have done so far. Of course the pressure will be different for a final but we still have to play to our strengths. Finals are always nice if you win them and that’s what we want to do. “Anything you do starts with belief. Do we believe we can win the final? Of course we believe we can win the final but we respect the team [Eintracht] and will prepare well.” Having lost the first leg by the only goal, James Tavernier and Glen Kamara had afforded Rangers a 2-0 lead at half-time. Leipzig responded though their prolific forward Christopher Nkunku 20 minutes from time but John Lundstram had the final say after the visiting goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi failed to deal with a routine cross. “It’s been an amazing night,” said Van Bronckhorst. “We had the start we wanted, it was important to score first in this game. At half-time we knew it would be hard because they needed to push and they did. I knew the next goal would be decisive, John’s goal gave us the energy and power to play the closing minutes. “I am very proud. The interaction with the fans was amazing. I have had so many games here as player and manager but the atmosphere here was incredible.” Van Bronckhorst reflected once more on the Rangers kit man of more than 30 years, Jimmy Bell, who died suddenly following Sunday’s draw at Celtic Park. The Rangers players and their management paused to toast Bell’s life amid dressing room celebrations. “We will miss him for the rest of our lives,” Van Bronckhorst said. Domenico Tedesco, the Leipzig manager, believed his team were guilty of overplaying in front of goal. He added: “The atmosphere is one of the best I have encountered, every [Rangers] player was pushed by that. We needed to make it 2-2 and never let it go to 3-1. It was all too easy, the final goal we conceded.”",Sport/Football,Rangers’ Van Bronckhorst eyes  ‘another proud moment’ in Europa League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/rangers-giovanni-van-bronckhorst-eyes-another-proud-moment-europa-league-final-rb-leipzig
5/6/2022,"Vegan diets can help people who are overweight or have type 2 diabetes lose weight and lower their blood sugar levels, research suggests. A meta analysis showed that adhering to a vegan diet over three months reduced body weight by about 4.1kg (9lb) on average compared with control diets, and cut blood sugar levels. There was little or no effect on blood pressure or levels of cholesterol or triglycerides, a type of fat. The data was drawn from 11 randomised trials including 796 people who were overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 25 or who had type 2 diabetes. The results were presented at the European Congress on Obesity. Anne-Ditte Termannsen, of the Steno Diabetes Centre in Copenhagen, who led the research, said: “This rigorous assessment of the best available evidence to date indicates with reasonable certainty that adhering to a vegan diet for at least 12 weeks may result in clinically meaningful weight loss and improve blood sugar levels, and therefore can be used in the management of overweight and type 2 diabetes. “Vegan diets likely lead to weight loss because they are associated with a reduced calorie intake due to a lower content of fat and higher content of dietary fibre.” A second piece of research presented at the conference in Maastricht found women were more likely than men to gain weight during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. In both sexes, people under the age of 45 were more likely to pile on extra pounds than older age groups. The research covering almost 1 million adults in the UK used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) of more than 200,000 UK GP practices, which includes information on BMI just before lockdown in March 2020, and in the year or so afterwards. Prof Thomas Yates, of the University of Leicester, said: “The implications of even modest weight gain at a population level in younger adults and women could translate into more diabetes, heart disease, cancers and other serious obesity-related health problems over the coming decades in these populations unless action is taken to reverse the effects of lockdown.” A third study found that toddlers eat more vegetables if they are rewarded for trying them. A three-month research programme on children on aged one to four at nurseries in Limburg, in the Netherlands, found that giving children rewards such as stickers or small toy crowns may help them develop a taste for healthy food. Britt van Belkom, of Maastricht University, who carried out the study, said the type of reward was very important. “It should be fun but not food,” she said.",News/Society,"Vegan diet can help overweight people shed pounds, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/05/vegan-diet-can-help-overweight-people-shed-pounds-study-shows
5/6/2022,"The clock was ticking. Eintracht Frankfurt, two goals up on aggregate, looked comfortable but not impregnable. And even with 10 men, West Ham were enjoying plenty of possession and had four substitutes left to deploy. And so, with a European final at stake and the climax approaching, the world eagerly awaited David Moyes’s next move. As it turned out, Moyes’s next move was to attack a ball boy and get himself sent off. So close. The margins in this game, and all that. And although this tie was probably already gone by the time he was slinking down the tunnel, the angry veins in his temples finally receding, the departure of the West Ham manager felt like a bizarrely fitting epilogue to this semi-final, one that began in east London in a bouquet of bubbles and euphoria, and ended on the banks of the River Main in ignominy and anticlimax. It was fitting because it encapsulated just how comprehensively the Bundesliga underdogs had managed to mess with West Ham’s heads, to force them from their comfort zone, to take them to new and frightening places. Amid a torrent of noise, a menacing undercurrent of fan violence and one of the biggest occasions in the club’s history, West Ham froze and faltered and finally flipped. Forced to live on their wits, to find new solutions on the fly, there would be no Plan B: just a depleted and slightly weary Plan A. This was as true in the first leg as it was here. On paper, West Ham had the players and the pedigree to prevail. But as the pressure grew, they shrunk. The reasons for this feel partly physical, partly mental and partly tactical. A team operating on simple, well-drilled patterns – the switch to the wingers, the quick ball into Michail Antonio, the set piece – was unable to adapt when those patterns failed to yield chances. The courage required to play the ball through the Eintracht press – a fierce and organised press, admittedly – was conspicuously absent. How much of this can be laid at the feet of Moyes remains a point of debate. Certainly it feels harsh to be too critical of a style and a system that has brought perhaps the most sustained period of success West Ham have enjoyed this century. Moyes-ball failed here. But also, Moyes-ball got them here in the first place. The overriding impression, conversely, was of a squad and a coach currently operating at the very limits of their potential, who – frankly – could use a little help. You could argue that Saïd Benrahma and Andriy Yarmolenko could have been introduced from the bench a little earlier. But really the broader problem here is one that has been apparent to most West Ham fans for months: the lack of a reliable goalscorer, different angles, different options. Antonio has been a brilliant, ballistic force up front for the last few seasons. Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen have gamely stepped up at times. But really Antonio needs some full-time help: someone to challenge him, make space for him, give him a rest. You could also point the finger at Aaron Cresswell for his early red card, perhaps the defining moment in the whole tie. But really it was an error of judgment that stemmed from a basic lack of confidence, grappling Jens Petter Hauge because he could not be sure of winning the duel by legitimate means. (And why is a 5ft 7in left-back being left to defend an aerial one on one in the first place?) That lack of confidence infected West Ham throughout this tie, and is also indicative of a wider issue. The financial situation is stable. The squad is solid and good. There is a big-money takeover in the offing, a huge stadium that after six years is finally beginning to feel like a home. And so really the issue here is one of nerve. With some braver investment over the last two windows West Ham might have been challenging for the top four and in a European final. Are the club’s owners and decision-makers serious about taking the next step? Or will they continue to obsess over value, streamlining, punching above their weight? What about adding some weight? The progress under Moyes has been palpable. This European campaign has provided West Ham supporters with some irresistible memories and their players with some valuable experience. Equally, they are already beginning to slip back in the Premier League table and are in danger of missing out on Europe altogether next season. Declan Rice could be off in the summer. So what’s the plan? What’s the big idea? What’s the next move? For Eintracht, this was an unforgettable night: a fiesta of black and white ticker tape, flags and flares, a noise that never subsided and a wave of emotion that culminated in a wild pitch invasion at full time. A first European final since 1980 awaits. They seized their moment. It remains to be seen whether West Ham will ever have the audacity to seize theirs.",Sport/Football,David Moyes has taken West Ham far but failure to adapt cost them | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/05/david-moyes-has-taken-west-ham-far-but-failure-to-adapt-cost-them-dear
5/6/2022,"In the heated summer of 2020, thwarted in his desire for a violent crackdown on protesters for racial justice, Donald Trump raged that senior advisers including his vice-president, Mike Pence, were “losers”. Trump’s second defense secretary, Mark Esper, details the extraordinary Oval Office outburst in a new book. A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Defense Secretary in Extraordinary Times, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. Esper’s account of an extraordinary presidential question in the same meeting – “Can’t you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something” – has already been reported. But the former defense secretary’s full account of the meeting, which happened as Washington and other US cities were convulsed by protests inspired by the police murder of George Floyd in late May 2020, is equally remarkable. Esper’s account of Gen Mark Milley’s attempts to explain to Trump the role of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff echoes others, including by the reporter Michael Bender in a book published last year and by William Barr, Trump’s second attorney general, who was present. Like Barr in his own memoir, the former secretary of defense does not stint when describing what he says Trump said when he was told Milley had no command authority over active duty or national guard forces the president wanted to deploy against protesters. “‘You are losers!’ the president railed. ‘You are all fucking losers!’ “This wasn’t the first time I had heard him use this language, but not with this much anger, and never directed at people in a room with him, let alone toward Barr, Milley and me.” Esper expands on Barr’s account of what the then-attorney general called a “tantrum”, saying Pence was also a target. “He repeated the foul insults again, this time directing his venom at the vice-president as well, who sat quietly, stone-faced, in the chair at the far end of the semi-circle closest to the Rose Garden. I never saw him yell at the vice-president before, so this really caught my attention.” Pence was a loyal vice-president to Trump until 6 January 2021, the day of the deadly Capitol riot, when he refused to attempt to block certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. Like Trump, Pence is now eyeing a run for the presidency in 2024. Esper also writes that “Trump shouted, ‘None of you have any backbone to stand up to the violence,’ and suggested we were fine with people ‘burning down our cities’.” The former defense secretary then details the question about whether protesters could be shot. Esper, who presents himself throughout his book as one of a group of aides who resisted the wilder impulses of Trump and his acolytes, says Trump did not order the shooting of protesters but was instead “waiting, it seemed, for one of us to yield and simply agree”. That, Esper writes, “wasn’t going to happen”.",News/US news,"Trump called top aides including Pence ‘losers’ as 2020 protests raged, book says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/trump-aides-pence-losers-2020-protests-book-mark-esper
5/6/2022,"A new tech watchdog will be given the power to impose multibillion-pound fines on major firms such as Google and Facebook if they breach rules designed to protect consumers and businesses. The Digital Markets Unit (DMU) will protect small businesses from predatory practices and will give consumers greater control over how their data is used, the government said. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said ministers will introduce legislation to underpin the DMU’s powers in “due course” amid speculation that only a draft bill will be mentioned in the Queen’s speech next week. The new unit, established last year, operates within the UK’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, and will enforce new codes of conduct for the biggest tech firms operating in the UK. The rules will make it easier for smartphone users to choose which search engines they use and will allow consumers to opt out of targeted personalised adverts. “The customer is always right, but sometimes they don’t get a choice,” said the consumer minister, Paul Scully. “We’ll stop companies from using their power to harm customers, whether they’re limiting shoppers’ choices to certain software on their devices or making it hard for people to decide how their data is used.” Tech companies will be required to inform businesses of significant changes that would affect them, such as algorithm adjustments that steer traffic away from certain sites. The unit will also be given the power to resolve disputes between tech platforms and news providers, so that publishers are paid fairly for their content. App developers will also be able to sell their apps on fairer and more transparent terms, the government said. The DMU will have the power to impose fines of up to 10% of a company’s global turnover – nearly £10bn in the case of Facebook’s owner, Meta – or 5% of daily global turnover for each day that an offence continues. “The CMA welcomes these proposals and we’re pleased that the government has taken forward a number of our recommendations that will allow the DMU to oversee an effective and robust digital markets regime in the UK,” said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. The government is also introducing the online safety bill, which is due to feature in the Queen’s speech and requires tech firms to protect users from harmful content such as images of child sexual abuse. The bill, which is due to become law around the end of the year, will be enforced by the communications regulator, Ofcom, and will also carry the threat of multibillion-pound fine for breaches. The online safety bill also carries the threat of criminal prosecutions for tech executives for offences such as hampering an Ofcom investigation. The government said that under the DMU senior company managers will face civil penalties if their businesses do not engage properly with requests for information.",News/Technology,UK watchdog will have power to impose huge fines on big tech firms,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/05/uk-watchdog-will-have-power-to-impose-huge-fines-on-big-tech-firms

5/6/2022,"The Conservatives are braced for a nerve-shredding 24 hours after voting closed in local elections across the UK, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats expecting to make gains. Taking place against the backdrop of the cost of living crisis, the first nationwide polls since Partygate will be widely read as a test of whether Boris Johnson has become an electoral liability. Every council seat in Wales, Scotland and London is being contested, as well as thousands more across England – more than 6,800 in all. At the same time, voters in Northern Ireland are electing all 90 members of the national assembly at Stormont, where the nationalist Sinn Féin could be returned as the largest party for the first time. Many English councils will be counting through the night, while results in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not expected until well into Friday. Labour and Lib Dem sources suggested turnout appeared to be low, which they suggested could reflect Tory supporters staying at home rather than switching to another party. The former Conservative minister Nick Boles, who once served as Johnson’s chief of staff when Johnson was mayor of London, declared he was voting Labour, while Dominic Cummings chose polling day to renew his calls for “regime change”. As results emerge, Labour is preparing a detailed dive into vote shares in 35 to 50 key constituencies in the hope of showing that it is on track to make the gains necessary to win a general election. The behind-the-scenes project, known as Operation Clear Day, will examine how the vote share is tracking against polling in key marginal wards and areas. Among those that will be watched intently are Hyndburn, Bury North and Bury South, Stevenage and Southampton. In London, the best signs of potential gains to be made at a general election will be in Barnet, which Labour hopes to gain, and Chingford in Waltham Forest, where the party failed to oust Iain Duncan Smith in 2019. Barry Rawlings, the leader of the Labour group on Barnet council, said he was hopeful of turning the town hall red for the first time. “I think we’re fairly confident we’ll take the council,” he said. Labour also hopes to make progress in south Wales, where it lost overall control of councils in areas including Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent when the seats were last contested five years ago. Senior aides say the most crucial battle of all for Keir Starmer is in Scotland, where the Labour leader must show the party has got back to second place ahead of the Conservatives and is making gains against the SNP in key areas including Glasgow, in order to be on track to win a significant number of new constituency seats in two years’ time. Conservatives are jittery about the risk London councils including Wandsworth and Westminster falliing to Labour, and losing out to the Lib Dems in longtime Tory areas in the south-east and south-west. Speaking after the polls closed, the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said: “I am optimistic that thanks to their hard work, the Liberal Democrats will gain ground in areas across the blue wall where voters are fed up of being taken for granted. “After knocking on hundreds of doors this election, one thing is clear: people are sick of Boris Johnson’s Conservatives. They have had enough of seeing their taxes hiked, sewage dumped in their rivers and local health services run into the ground.” Lib Dem sources said early indications from elections to Somerset’s new unitary authority were good for them. They believe a win there could bode well for the forthcoming Tiverton and Honiton byelection in neighbouring Devon, triggered by the resignation of the Conservative MP Neil Parish for watching pornography in the House of Commons. Senior Conservative MPs are preparing to blame their party’s performance on the cost of living crisis, and take the opportunity to press home the need for Rishi Sunak to do more to help hard-pressed households. The Tories are hoping for a better night outside the south of England, and are expected to argue that Johnson’s 2019 general election coalition is holding up and it is harder to see a path to a Labour victory. “There’s a lot of England that looks like Johnsonite England,” said one Tory strategist, pointing to Sunderland, the Black Country and Walsall as places where the party believes it may put in a stronger performance.",News/Politics,Conservatives brace for losses as votes counted in local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/05/conservatives-brace-for-losses-as-votes-counted-in-local-elections
