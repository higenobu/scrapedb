2/28/2022,"Cambridge University lecturers are accusing the institution of pressuring them into taking on “explosive workloads” to deliver its famous one-on-one tutorials. A survey of university teaching officers (UTOs) by the University and College Union branch found that a third (35%) felt they could not refuse requests from peers and superiors to take on extra weekly tutorials, or “supervisions” as they are known, even though nearly half of those surveyed said they would like to deliver fewer of them. Michael Abberton, the president of the UCU Cambridge branch, said: “The supervision system is not working for anyone in its current set up. It exploits casual workers, who need to earn an income and accumulate teaching experience. It overburdens permanent staff, who are already under the pressure of explosive workloads. “The university and the colleges cannot keep on denying that the system needs urgent reform, with improvements over pay, contracts and training for undergraduate supervisors.” A Cambridge University spokesperson said the system granted supervisors flexibility to choose which and how many colleges they work with and their hours, while training was provided for free and average pay is “well above the living wage”.He added that “since the colleges are separate legal and financial employers, they cannot be covered by a single agreement”. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of the UTOs surveyed by UCU said they delivered more than five hours of supervision a week, with preparation time averaging about 20 hours, on top of their full-time teaching schedules. Half said they worked more than 50 hours and 21% exceeded 60 hours a week, with some saying they were prevented from doing the research required to further their academic careers.One humanities UTO who spoke to the Guardian said she had been pressured by peers who warned the courses would not remain viable, and “to stay in the good graces of one’s senior colleagues”, especially given an “unstated expectation” that junior colleagues would supervise more, leaving her with only three weeks to spend on research.Fifty-six per cent of respondents also complained about low rates of pay, at £31 per hour of supervision, which does not cover preparation. The union estimates that in some cases this amounts to an hourly rate of around or below minimum wage. The survey builds on research from last year, which found that although Cambridge advertises supervisions to prospective students as a core feature of its world-leading teaching model, many of these are delivered on a “gig economy” basis. Nearly a third (28%) are delivered by teaching officers, who have a secure contract with the university, while almost half (45%) are delivered by precariously employed staff.This month, staff across UK campuses began 10 days of strike action over pay, pensions, insecure contracts and deteriorating working conditions. Supervisors also said the “byzantine” nature of the university’s structure – in which the central university arranges supervisions for some subjects and year groupings, and individual colleges for others – was partly to blame for the lack of transparency over differing rates of pay they received. “There’s nothing rational about Cambridge, it’s a product of history and changing government regulation and different forms of influence. There’s no way to understand except by being in the institution and having to navigate it,” said Graham Denyer Willis, a UTO who said “extreme amounts” of supervision had taken a toll on his career.",News/Education,Cambridge lecturers accuse university of ‘explosive workloads’,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/28/cambridge-lecturers-accuse-university-workloads-staff-low-pay
2/28/2022,"I did a Jackanory Playhouse and got slightly drunk after the recording. I said: “It’s not real storytelling, is it? We’re reading off an Autocue.” The senior BBC figures said: “Well, what would you do?” My daughter was 10 at the time, tiny, feisty, but crap at football. I watched her charging around the playground yelling at the boys and thought: “If there really was a Robin Hood and he’d met my daughter, it wouldn’t have been him who was in charge of the gang.” My collaborator was the producer and director Dave Bell. Initially, we’d talked about me playing Robin Hood, because if an actor writes a series, why wouldn’t he give himself a big part? But I realised it would be more useful if I played the baddie, the Sheriff of Nottingham. Villains dictate the pace of a story and – having spent so many years as Baldrick in Blackadder, who’s a sweet, charming, braindead cutie – I wanted to play the polar opposite. I’d left school at 16 and had no education worth boasting about, so I was worried when I first began writing. People probably thought I had the same background as the rest of the Blackadder gang, who had all gone to public school, then spent three years being witty in Cambridge Footlights. But I hadn’t had that kind of life at all. So I asked Richard Curtis to give my writing the once-over. Luckily, he never saw our Little Brown Noses episode, which spoofed the showbusiness nature of Comic Relief, which he co-founded. They were very sweaty summers filming in Minehead, on the Somerset coast. Makeup designer Christine Powers created the black goatee the Sheriff wears. It was really itchy – getting a brush handle up the inside of it for a scratch between takes was an absolute joy. I always wanted the show to feature contemporary music, particularly because the Robin Hood legend lists one of the Merry Men as being a musician called Alan-a-Dale. Danny John-Jules, who played Rasta spiv Barrington, was a great dancer, but a terrible rapper. I’m glad the It’s Pancake Day rap became an earworm, though. Tens of thousands of people still join me in celebrating this ridiculous confection. About three years ago, I was invited to a convention with the rest of the Maid Marian cast. So many women in their 30s and 40s turned up with their kids – they’d been passionate fans. As a bloke in today’s climate, to be thanked for making a small contribution to the way women are portrayed on TV was just about the nicest thing that’s ever happened to me. I can’t lie: some mornings the set stank. You’d go down to shoot and find the mud had settled and the whole place was crawling with flies. Not nice when you’re all in pigskin shoes. Also, my underclothing was this particular shade of yellow that kept attracting ticks. I had to be checked between shots for bites. I loved where the script was coming from, though, empowering young women. It’s worth remembering that this was pre-Spice Girls. I’d done my thesis at college on the status of women in theatre, so I was driven by the idea of it. Adam Morris was cast as Robin of Kensington, a costume designer who people mistake for a heroic outlaw. I’d known Adam at drama school and the roles were a massive deal for both of us. At one point, Marian makes a speech in which she declares: “One day, pubs will be named after us, and we won’t have to pay unfair taxes.” That was the linchpin moment of the first series and it’s my favourite scene. I was incredibly nervous as we were filming it – there must have been 50 crew members watching from the clearing. Ramblers passing through Porlock Forest would sometimes wander on to the set. There’d be cries of: “Get a costume on them!” When I gave up acting to become a garden designer, there were a lot of articles about “the maid leaving Sherwood Forest to work among plants”. In some ways, though, it felt like a natural transition. My dad had been a gardener and I did it as a hobby when I wasn’t acting. Eventually, it felt right to go full-time. But Marian was great fun. I mean, what other job lets you go to the loo on a big hill overlooking the Devon coast, and then ask: “What are we doing today? Oh yeah, having a sword fight and jumping off trees attached to ropes.”  Maid Marian and Her Merry Men is streaming on BritBox.",Arts/Culture,‘I wanted to play the polar opposite of Baldrick’ – Tony Robinson on making Maid Marian and Her Merry Men ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/28/polar-opposite-baldrick-tony-robinson-on-making-maid-marian-and-her-merry-men-blackadder-robin-hood
2/28/2022,"Price comparison website Comparethemarket has pulled its ads featuring animated Russian meerkat Aleksandr Orlov from news bulletins in light of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The company, which spends tens of millions on marketing in the UK annually in the competitive market for price comparison sites, said it had reviewed its media plan to make sure the ads do not appear around content such as news bulletins on the Ukrainian conflict. “The Comparethemarket meerkats are fictional characters,” said a spokesperson for the company, which is owned by the Peterborough-based financial services firm BGL. “They have no association with Russia and the current situation. We are continually reviewing our advertising to ensure we’re being sensitive to the current situation.” The ads – which feature Orlov, a Russian billionaire meerkat from Moscow, and his sidekick Sergei – have run since 2009 and have been instrumental in taking the 16-year-old company from also-ran status to one of the top comparison sites in the UK. Orlov’s catchphrase, “Simples”, became so widespread it was included in the Collins English Dictionary in 2010. The character – who is voiced by Simon Greenall, perhaps best known as Michael, the geordie handyman from I’m Alan Partridge – competes against other catchy creations in the price comparison sector including Gocompare’s irritating opera singer Gio Compario, played by Welsh singer Wynne Evans. The invasion of Ukraine has put the spotlight on firms using, or selling, products that might be associated with the conflict or Russia. Last week, British supermarkets came under pressure on social media to rename chicken kievs to “kyivs” to show solidarity with Ukraine, whose capital is Kyiv in Ukrainian, Kiev in Russian. The US chain Applebees was forced to pull a lighthearted promotional TV ad campaign after network CNN aired it as part of a split screen as news coverage showed air raid sirens being sounded in the Ukrainian capital.

2/28/2022,"Luciano Spalletti called it a “crossroads” in Napoli’s season. After their elimination from Europe on Thursday night, his team had no dreams left to pursue beyond a Scudetto bid that appeared to be fading. Top of the table at the start of December, the Partenopei had since fallen behind both Milan clubs and were starting to feel Juventus’s breath on their necks. Results were trending in the wrong direction. More importantly, so were performances. Napoli drew away to Barcelona at the Camp Nou but their 4-2 defeat in the return leg was more emphatic than the scoreline suggests. Spalletti’s team offered no answers to questions posed by Adama Traoré, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Frenkie de Jong. Three days earlier, Napoli had needed a late equaliser to draw 1-1 away to 17th-placed Cagliari. Their opponents created the better chances, and lamented a penalty not given when the ball struck Mario Rui’s hand inside the box. Optimism was in short supply ahead of Sunday’s trip to face a Lazio team with Champions League ambitions of their own. Spalletti, though, did not shy away from the moment. For the second week running, both Milan and Inter had drawn, giving his side the chance to go joint-top. “We need to choose whether we want to be quickly forgotten or to linger as heroes in the heads of Napoli’s supporters.” At first, it seemed as though Lazio might send them off down the former path. Ciro Immobile drew a save from David Ospina in the opening minute and Lazio would create two more good scoring chances inside the opening 10. Luis Alberto collapsed face-down into the turf after side-footing a shot wide at the back post. The Biancocelesti were carrying the weight of disappointment from their own European exit on Thursday, losing 4-3 on aggregate to Porto after some wasteful finishing in the second leg. Comments from the Lazio manager, Maurizio Sarri, made plain that he had not let go, either, of the 4-0 defeat they suffered to Napoli back in November. Anxiousness to avoid a repeat was understandable in the man who led the Partenopei to their highest-ever points total in 2017-18. He came with a better gameplan this time around, having Sergej Milinkovic-Savic drift right to accompany Felipe Anderson and flood one side of the pitch. Lorenzo Insigne was forced backwards to assist Napoli’s overwhelmed left-back, Mario Rui. Yet Lazio were unable to crown their superiority with a goal. Napoli, let off the hook, gradually found their way back into the game. Still, they struggled to create scoring opportunities of their own before Spalletti subbed off his team’s No 10, Piotr Zielinski, for Eljif Elmas just before the hour mark. The Poland international had been effectively smothered by Lazio, but his replacement brought a less subtle, more combative approach. It was Elmas who intercepted a pass from Patric to launch a Napoli attack moments after coming onto the pitch. The ball came back to him via Matteo Politano, and he nudged it through for Insigne to score from the edge of the box. No player in a Napoli shirt might have needed a goal more. Insigne was whistled by his own team’s supporters as he left the pitch against Barcelona, disappointment at the team’s performance mixing with resentment at the player’s decision to leave his boyhood club and join Toronto FC at the end of this campaign. Whether distracted by his impending move or simply out of form, this has not been Insigne’s finest season. He did score against Barcelona, his eighth goal in all competitions but also a seventh from the penalty spot. His only strike from open play had come in a 3-0 stroll past Legia Warsaw during the Europa League’s group stage. On Sunday he took his chance brilliantly, whipping a shot first-time around the lunging boot of Adam Marusic and into the bottom corner. Could this be a moment that restores him? Insigne put the ball in the net again seven minutes later but was denied by an offside ruling from the VAR booth. The game moved into a helter-skelter finale, Lazio pouring forward while Napoli sought a winner on the break. Pedro, on as a second-half substitute for the hosts, had already drawn one brilliant save from Ospina before he equalised with a spectacular first-time volley of a ball that had been headed clear from a free-kick. Napoli were back at the crossroads. Two minutes plus injury time remained. In the press box, match reports were hastily being reconstructed around familiar narratives of a team that is always said to crumble when the stakes are raised – coming up short just like they did on Thursday against Barcelona, just like they did under Sarri when they let the title slip through their fingers despite that record points haul. Not before or since Diego Maradona have Napoli seen a Scudetto challenge through to a triumphant conclusion. Perhaps they never will. But on Sunday, at least, they refused to yield, launching themselves straight back onto the attack. Victor Osimhen was denied by a brilliant block in the first minute of injury time. Nobody could stop Fabián Ruiz in the fourth. In a game of spectacular goals, this was a worthy winner. There were three defenders between the Spaniard and the goal when he received Lorenzo Insigne’s lay-off, so he swung the ball around them, sending it on a trajectory that seemed to be moving off target before nipping back in to kiss the inside of the post before nestling in the corner. Players spilled over the advertising hoardings in celebration with substitutes wearing training tops carrying the slogan “Sarò con te, e tu non devi mollare” – “I will be with you, and you must never give up”. It is a line from a terrace chant that Spalletti adopted in pre-season as a mantra for his players, a phrase to remind them who they are playing for. The juxtaposition of yellow bibs and blue tracksuits lent those words a different poignancy on Sunday, steering minds toward struggles more profound than football. Spalletti had spoken against the war in Ukraine at his pre-game press conference, saying: “No motive can be valid to force people to become refugees in the world, to risk being hit by bombs.” FridayMilan 1-1 UdineseGenoa 0-0 Internazionale SaturdayEmpoli 2-3 JuventusSalernitana 1-1 BolognaSassuolo 2-1 Fiorentina SundayLazio 1-2 NapoliSpezia 0-1 RomaTorino 1-2 CagliariVerona 3-1 Venezia To talk about resilience in a sporting performance feels trivial in a moment like this, yet Spalletti and his players were entitled to feel proud of sticking to their task and earning a result that puts them back on top of the Serie A table for the first time in almost three months. “I hear everyone busting our balls, saying that this team doesn’t have character,” said Spalletti. “Now I want to see what they say today. This team has character.” It has another big game coming up next weekend, too, against the Milan team with whom they now share first place. Napoli’s season remains at the crossroads.

2/28/2022,"A Ukrainian sailor has been arrested in Mallorca and faces charges of attempting to sink a yacht owned by Alexander Mikheev, the CEO of the Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport and former head of the Russian helicopter federation. The boat is moored in the harbour of Port Adriano. The unnamed man, who has been employed for the past 10 years as a mechanic on the Lady Anastasia, Mikheev’s 48-metre, £5m yacht, said he felt he had to do something after seeing footage of a Russian rocket attack on a block of flats in Kyiv, his home town. The defendant told the judge that he believed the rocket had been manufactured by Mikheev’s company. Once on board the vessel he told the crew members, most of whom are also Ukrainians, to abandon ship. He allegedly then went to the engine room and opened a large valve in an attempt to sink the yacht. The crew members, aided by port staff, intervened to prevent the sinking. “The owner of this yacht is a criminal who makes his living selling arms that are now being used to kill Ukrainians,” he told police when he was arrested. He was released several hours later, pending charges. Meanwhile, one of two yachts undergoing a refit in the MB92 superyacht shipyard in Barcelona slipped away at the weekend after 146 days in the yard.

2/28/2022,"This ambitious French sci-fi parable has some quiet moments of beauty and poignancy, but otherwise it’s a long slog – and so bombastic, jejune and ill-considered that it feels far more drawn out than the 87 minutes running time would suggest. In writer-director Romain Quirot’s vision of the future, humanity has worked out how to mine an inexhaustible power supply from an astral object that happens to wander by; it is called, unimaginatively, “the red moon”. This heavenly body appears to be like the living, sentient planet in Stanislaw Lem’s novel Solaris (a book adapted twice, by Andrei Tarkovsky and Steven Soderbergh), and our hero Paul WR (Hugo Becker) can somehow sense that the red moon is quite cross with us earthlings for some reason. That would appear to be why he refuses to fly a mission to destroy the approaching lunar body, even though, in a frankly silly plot move, he is the only person in the world that can possibly do it. Likewise, the script is vague about whether the Earth has become one huge desert that resembles Morocco because of the red moon or just due to the climate meltdown we’re already experiencing. First-time director Quirot is clearly more interested in making points about the dysfunctional family dynamics Paul grew up with: a mum who died when he was young, a distracted science genius dad (Jean Reno, wasted here). There’s also an older brother named Eliott (Paul Hamy) who uses his psychic powers to persuade people to kill themselves. Instead of the big mission, Paul goes on the run to search for a mysterious forest for no very clear reason. He teams up with a pretty, gamine young woman (Lya Oussadit-Lessert) who he meets at a rest stop where he tries to get a new battery for his electric hover car. These cars, you see, are supposed to float above the ground thanks to the mysterious energy source harvested from the red moon. They look good in the VFX long shots but Quirot never explains why they rock around when they’re driving, just like any old banger with four wheels would. The inattention to detail is what makes this feel like a triumph of style over content, and not in a good way.

2/28/2022,"In 2017, I went to Moscow to see the empire of Russian billionaire Arkadiy Novikov. There was a new restaurant on every corner – smelling of garlic but also paint, the air thick with money – and Novikov seemed to own all of them. It wasn’t possible, in the end, to figure out what kind of restaurateur he was, a good one or a bad one, because he just owned so many, spanning such an impossible range of cuisines, that it became a numbers game. Some of them couldn’t help but be good; others could help it. Novikov told me about the abject poverty of his childhood, sharing one tomato with his mother and grandmother, making a cucumber last a week; and his apprenticeship, cooking soup for the dogs in the Russian army. There were bits missing from his origin story, specifically, how Russia after perestroika (the 1980s reformation movement) delivered him not a part of the restaurant scene but the majority of it, but for some reason I chose to focus my questions on how you make a soup for a dog. “Pearl barley,” he said. “The head of a pig; a few potatoes.” His culinary sensibility was marked by a hyper-masculine obsession with size, steaks as big as the plates they sat on, from Miratorg, a million-hectare (2.5m-acre) ranch. I took it as part of the pantomime; strongman politics were to Moscow what kombucha was to New York. Looking back I realise what he was actually describing, quite carefully, was the agricultural element of a steadily building fortress economy. The EU sanctions against Russia, launched in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea, never included food. Instead, they were concentrated on cutting off access to capital markets, and blocking the import of tech that could be used for arms, fracking or oil exploration. Putin’s retaliatory move was to ban fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and dairy from the EU and the US, as well as Canada, Australia and Norway. By 2017, that Miratorg ranch was supplying one-fifth of all the meat in Russia. Novikov, meanwhile, was trying to make sure the international tensions didn’t inconvenience the discerning palate, by recreating European charcuterie and cheeses. He had French and Swiss chefs holed up in cavernous factories that shone like laboratories, making chorizo, mozzarella, feta and brie, with a restaurant attached serving only cheese. Sometimes with a pizza or a salad underneath it, but basically cheese. I didn’t give a huge amount of thought to the politics behind it, since it was a very elite market, and didn’t seem to touch the lives of the ordinary citizen. Wages and living standards were falling – this stuff was all terrifically expensive, it seemed like a frippery. I did, however, think a lot about the cheese, which made no sense. They had money, time, expertise, raw materials, and yet they couldn’t get a mozzarella to taste like mozzarella; instead, they had these hard little balls of solid texture, with nothing like that unique journey, from stringy exterior to squidgy middle. The feta tasted more like Georgian cheese than anything Greek (Georgian cheese is wonderful, actually, but it’s not the same). The “brie” resembled brie only in so far as it was round. I was too polite to ask how on earth it had all gone so wrong, and arrived privately at two broad conclusions: first, that centuries of knowledge are embedded in something greater than a single cheesemaker, and no one alone can recreate them; second, that Russian cows must be wired different. They were the wrong broad conclusions – this was a statement of intent. It didn’t matter what the cheese tasted like to me; what mattered was the long game, which was not to wait for international reconciliation, but to forge on in glorious isolation, plugging the lifestyle gaps with play-dough, if needs be. One of the many difficult lessons of the 21st century is that you should always pay attention to how rich people are spending their money, even if it looks like nothing. If they’re eating bad cheese, never stop asking why.

2/28/2022,"In 2019 Tamara Stefanovich treated London to a thrilling survey of the piano étude in the last century, from Scriabin to the present day, which was one of the highlights of the musical year in the capital. Now she has turned her attention to sonatas, and devised a three-part recital – over two and a half hours of music, taking in 20 works – that mixes the baroque and the modern, and carefully avoids what many would see as the heyday of the piano sonata, from Haydn and Mozart to Brahms and Liszt. As well as sonatas by the Bachs, Johann Sebastian and his son Carl Philipp Emanuel, in the first part of Stefanovich’s programme, one-movement sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti and his Catalan successor Antonio Soler provided baroque interludes in each section, each of which was played as a seamless sequence. The ending of one sonata was sometimes elided with the opening of the next so that, for instance, the low G that ends Scarlatti’s Sonata Kk13 became the launchpad for the freewheeling fantasia that opens CPE Bach’s G minor Sonata, while the quiet ending of Soler’s D flat Sonata R110 ushered in the surprisingly pastoral (almost Vaughan Williams-like!) opening of Hindemith’s Third Sonata. It all seemed a little breathless at times, but Stefanovich generally opted for more reflective Scarlatti and Soler sonatas, aware no doubt that her 20th-century choices rarely offered much repose, whether in her typically fearless performance of Bartók’s hyperactive sonata, her brittle, extrovert one of Hanns Eisler’s Schoenbergian First Sonata, his official Op 1, or her slyly malevolent take on Scriabin’s Ninth Sonata, with its incessant trills and curling wisps of melody. The Second Sonata by Nikolai Roslavets, took over where the Scriabin left off, though as Stefanovich pointed out from the platform, it was more important in the context of the present time that he was a Ukrainian. And finally there was Galina Ustvolskaya’s Sixth Sonata, a thunderous barrage of clusters played with fists and forearms, interspersed with forlorn fragments of melody; an extraordinary end to a remarkable feat of sustained pianism.",Arts/Music,Tamara Stefanovich: 20 Sonatas review – a remarkable feat of sustained pianism,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/28/tamara-stefanovich-20-sonatas-review-queen-elizabeth-hall
