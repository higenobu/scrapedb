5/17/2022,"Given the employee calibre and attrition rate of this government, it’s always a heart-in-mouth moment when they unleash a previously unheard-of minister on the airwaves. Much like the bit in the Simpsons where Mr Burns releases the winged monkeys from his window with a hopeful “Fly, my pretties – fly!”. When thuds and bloodcurdling shrieks follow, he turns to his retainer, Smithers, with the curt instruction: “Continue the research.” Perhaps No 10’s comms geniuses felt this way when they debuted the hitherto deservedly obscure safeguarding minister, Rachel Maclean, on to Monday’s breakfast shows to discuss the cost of living crisis. Who knows why the random nitwit generator machine had made it Rachel’s turn? Maybe Helen Whately was refusing to come out of her trailer. In many ways I refuse to believe Rachel even is the safeguarding minister – a huge part of me assumes she is just a character hastily assembled from discarded awayday ideas and then given a pretend job title that it would feel rude to argue with. “Just say she’s the ‘safeguarding minister’. Sounds like a thing.” As for Rachel’s thoughts on how increasingly anxious citizens can respond to multiple financial pressures, let’s see them fly. “We need to have a plan to grow the economy,” she hazarded (no shit), “and to make sure that people are able to protect themselves better, whether that is by taking on more hours or moving to a better paid job.” Continue the research. In the meantime, if you’re keeping a tally of government suggestions for how to deal with acute real-world financial distress, please add “Had you thought of being paid more?” to the pile. Said pile also features similar advice from Thérèse Coffey to work more hours, while George Eustice recently let shoppers in on the little secret of supermarket value ranges. “Generally speaking,” he generalised unspeakably, “what people find is by going for some of the value brands rather than own-branded products, they can actually contain and manage their household budget.” Amazing, isn’t it, that George still has all this good stuff in the tank, when money-saving expert Martin Lewis recently admitted, “I am out of tools to help people now … I’ve been through the financial crash, I’ve been through Covid. This is the worst, where we are right now … That is simply not tenable in our society. There is absolutely panic and it has not started yet.” Has Martin thought of pointing out ways people could retrain in investment banking? In the meantime, with the Bank of England governor appearing before the Treasury select committee on Monday to forecast “apocalyptic” food prices, do you get the sense that the government has anything in the same postcode as a plan to make things even mildly better? Hand on heart, no. Quite the opposite. In fact, it has two plans to make them worse. The first is a possible trade war with the EU, which smelled-it-dealt-it treaty critic David Frost seems to be suggesting is one of the good kinds of wars. And the second is Boris Johnson’s triumphant announcement, via the pages of the Daily Mail as opposed to their line managers, that he is going to lay off 91,000 civil servants. Let’s park the fact that the prime minister surely arrived at this number by the ancient clue-free technique for making cuts – thinking of the total number, then dividing it by five. Instead, we’ll focus on the main event, which is suggesting that the best idea for how to enter a recession is to make cuts to frontline service provision. Whatever it says on the back of Johnson’s napkin, there simply isn’t another way to make 91,000 cuts. Of course, No 10 doesn’t tell you about the frontline service provision, preferring instead to intimate that this will merely be a just-deserts response to civil servants working from home. This is the chief bugbear of that incorrigible desk-sniffer Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man whose own work desk does not even feature a computer, but who has recently been slithering round Whitehall like the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and leaving sub-Yodel “sorry I missed you” notes for civil servants. I’m told that Rupert Murdoch is obsessed with people returning to the office wherever they may work, so perhaps that puts lead in the Rees-Mogg pencil. Even so, for a government that has achieved absolutely nothing in office bar a Brexit deal it is currently threatening to torch, it does feel genuinely extraordinary to watch the Johnson administration work so committedly against this organic form of levelling up. As has become increasingly clear ever since the phrase was first farted out, they haven’t the first clue how to “level up” anything. Yet in one swift and elegant way, remote working is the market actually beginning to deliver their policy for them – by allowing people to draw metropolis salaries but physically locate themselves in less affluent regions for at least some of the working week. What’s not to embrace? Over to Boris Johnson, a man who famously works from home. Indeed, his officials have spent much of the year explaining that is why certain rules don’t apply to Downing Street. “My experience of working from home,” Johnson explained at the weekend, “is you spend an awful lot of time making another cup of coffee and then, you know, getting up, walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese, then walking very slowly back to your laptop and then forgetting what it was you’re doing.” Oh, you forgot what you were doing? Let us help you out. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BEING THE EFFING PRIME MINISTER. Ah well, perhaps another time. Sorry to have missed you.

5/17/2022,"A man has been arrested after a three-year-old boy was killed by a dog at a farm property in Greater Manchester. Daniel John Twigg was named by police on Tuesday as the victim of the dog attack in Milnrow, Rochdale, on Sunday afternoon. Greater Manchester police (GMP) said Daniel was in the area with a number of dogs before being found with serious injuries. A 48-year-old man was arrested under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 after handing himself in to police custody, the force said. He remains in custody for questioning. DCI Gina Brennand, of GMP’s major incident team, said: “I send my condolences to Daniel’s loved ones. This is a heartbreaking time for them, specially trained colleagues are supporting them. “Though a man is in custody, our investigation is very much ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident and ensure any criminal offences in relation to Sunday’s incident are identified and prosecutions sought.” GMP has referred itself to the independent police standards watchdog after it emerged that officers had previous contact at the Carr Lane location where Daniel was killed. The force has confirmed it received a report that a 17-year-old girl was bitten by a dog on the same street on 9 April – five weeks before Sunday’s incident. Signs at the farm entrance were clearly visible saying: “Dogs are loose. Do not leave your vehicle. Beep or call,” and gave a telephone number. Another sign read: “Warning. Beware of the dogs. They bite.” Police said several dogs had been seized and one, a cane corso, had been humanely destroyed.",News/UK news,Man arrested after three-year-old boy killed by dog in Rochdale,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/man-arrested-after-three-year-old-boy-killed-by-dog-in-rochdale
5/17/2022,"A third of migrant workers on UK fishing vessels work 20-hour shifts, and 35% report regular physical violence, according to new research that concludes there is rampant exploitation and abuse on British ships. “Leaving is not possible because I’m not allowed off the vessel to ask for help,” one migrant worker told researchers at the University of Nottingham Rights Lab, which focuses on modern slavery. They found fishers reported working excessive hours, with few breaks, on an average salary of £3.51 an hour. Interviews with migrant workers on fishing boats across the UK revealed experiences of racism and many accounts of “extreme violence”, including two reported incidents of graphic and sexually violent acts, it said. Workers from the Philippines, Indonesia, Ghana, Sri Lanka and India are recruited into the UK fishing industry on “transit visas”, a loophole that “legalises their exploitation”, according to the report, Letting Exploitation Off the Hook. Seafarers’ transit visas are intended to allow crew to join ships leaving UK ports for international waters, such as a container ship to China, for example. These visas tie workers to a single employer. This leaves them dependent on the ship’s captains for their working and living conditions, such as access to food and other essentials, and prevents them changing jobs. Workers can then potentially be abused and controlled by rogue shipowners. In a separate briefing published this week, the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) outlined its own findings on the use of transit visas, suggesting it was leading to “systematic” labour exploitation of migrants on UK vessels. It called for the closure of the loophole that allows the visas to be used on fishing vessels. Dr Jessica Sparks, associate director of the Rights Lab and author of the report, said: “Exploitative practices are widespread and endemic on vessels. Long hours for poor wages are endemic. It is well known that you can pay migrants less.” Interviews with the migrant workers revealed “traumatic” experiences of physical violence and racism, she said. “There were very traumatic reports of being physically beaten by captains. Most of the migrants reported being discriminated against, especially Ghanaians, [and] racial slurs while being beaten by captains. The amount of physical violence was surprising to me.” The report also found evidence of forced or compulsory labour among migrant workers in the UK fishing industry. One worker told researchers that “leaving is not possible because I’m not allowed off the vessel to ask for help”, adding: “There is no way to contact anyone. The captain keeps my phone, and when he gives it to me he supervises my calls.” Sparks interviewed 16 migrant workers, and conducted surveys with 166 crew members of vessels registered in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. More than 60% of migrant fishers interviewed reported hearing about or seeing their fellow workers being threatened or actually abused, whether physically, sexually or psychologically. About 75% said they felt discriminated against by their captain. One in three said they would be unlikely to leave their job because of debts. The report found that the migrant workers did not know who to trust, with more than 60% saying they would never report a grievance out of fear of reprisals – either against themselves or their families being blacklisted. Many owed debts to recruitment agencies. The report also contrasted the situation of migrant workers, who were poorly paid on a fixed wage, to local crews, who were paid a “crew share” – a percentage of the value of the fish landed or of the profit. “The industry is in engaged in a race to the bottom to undercut crew wages to maximise profitability,” it said. “These practices also have the potential to sow division between migrant and national fishers.” The UK relies on fishers from non-EU countries including the Philippines, Ghana and Indonesia but people from these countries have no automatic legal entitlement to work in the UK. Fishing boat owners apply for transit visas on the basis that their vessel operates “wholly or mainly” outside UK territorial waters, defined as more than 12 nautical miles from shore. Migrant fishers using those visas are required to work a “majority” of their time beyond territorial waters, and have no legal authority to “enter” the UK when returning to port. As a result, they are forced to live onboard the vessels for up to a year, despite accommodation on fishing boats usually being unsuitable for long-term stays. The ITF said the current transit visa scheme created a “two-tier” labour system onboard UK boats and that the misuse of the visa scheme had become a tool to traffic Ghanaians and Filipinos from the UK to the Republic of Ireland. In response to the findings, the Fishermen’s Welfare Alliance, made up of national fishing federations in the UK, welcomed the ITF’s conclusions that the transit worker visa was unfit for purpose and said it did not meet the requirements of a modern fishing industry. The parts of the industry that employed non-UK fishermen through the transit visa system had long lobbied the government for improvements, including having fishermen recognised as skilled workers, it said. The FWA said it was still studying the University of Nottingham report but added: “At first reading, it contains much that fishing industry representatives don’t recognise and is not representative of the situation across the UK, as the report itself states. “As industry representatives, we deplore and condemn bad practice and crew members being badly or unfairly treated, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.” ",News/Environment,Migrant workers ‘exploited and beaten’ on UK fishing boats,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/may/17/migrant-workers-exploited-and-beaten-on-uk-fishing-boats
5/17/2022,"What’s the most useful style (or styles) of knife?Kate, Swansea “A good knife is the most important part of any kitchen,” says David Carter, the founder of London barbecue joint Smokestak. But that’s not to say you need many; as the inimitable Anthony Bourdain wrote in Kitchen Confidential: “Please believe me, here’s all you will ever need in the knife department: one good chef’s knife, as large as is comfortable for your hand.” A Japanese gyuto or santoku will fit the bill for “around 90% of kitchen tasks”, says Tom Saunders, co-founder of knife emporium Kitchen Provisions in London. “The santoku is 16cm or 18cm; the gyuto runs from 18cm to 21cm or 24cm, but I normally push people to the longer size.” Chef John Chantarasak, whose book, Kin Thai: Modern Thai Recipes to Cook at Home, is released this month, also suggests a gyuto: “They tend to be strong and lightweight, with a multi-purpose blade that can be used for almost any task.” He recommends a 21cm blade, because it “hits the sweet spot for larger tasks while still having the necessary agility to perform more intricate cutting jobs”. Then, Saunders adds, you might want a petty knife – “that is, a little knife for whipping the tops off tomatoes, strawberries, or cutting a lemon” – and a bread knife. “After that, let your heart take you where you want to go.” That might, Carter suggests, be towards a paring knife: “It’s a bit more delicate [than a chef’s knife] and has a more flexible blade.” But the good news, Kate, is that you don’t have to decide straight away: “What people think they need and what they actually need are two different things,” Saunders says. And he speaks from experience: “Most people come in [to the shop] and want to buy a set of knives, but I don’t think I’ve ever sold a set of knives.” Instead, save your pennies and buy a better version of that chef’s, petty or bread knife. These things can, of course, be pricey. “Like anything, you pay for quality,” says Chantarasak, whose favourite knife (a 20cm Miyabi 500MCD 67) takes 10 weeks to make. “Saying that,” he counters, “I started out with a set of German Wüsthof knives, that will set you back around £80 just for a decent chef’s knife. I still use it at home nearly 10 years later, so I wouldn’t consider it the biggest expense”. If you want to spend less, Carter suggests Victorinox (“lots of chefs starting up will have those”), which start at about £24; Opinel are worth a look, too. Whatever you go for, however, keep that knife on point. “The thing people completely neglect is sharpening,” Saunders says. “I spend a lot on whetstones, and they’re utterly boring things, but what they do is amazing.” How often you choose to sharpen your knife depends on how much you use it – and what you use it for. “As a rule of thumb, every five months is good.” And getting into the habit of sharpening on a stone comes with an added benefit, Carter adds. “There’s a real motion to it … it’s a bit like therapy.” Got a culinary dilemma?

5/17/2022,"It’s hard to think of a horror movie character more iconic than Robert Englund’s Freddy Krueger. He stars in Wes Craven’s 1984 film A Nightmare on Elm Street and in sequels all the way up to (count ’em!) A Nightmare on Elm Street 6, Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare, and features in 44 episodes of the 80s TV series Freddy’s Nightmares. In 1994’s Wes Craven’s New Nightmare, Englund played a fictitious version of himself who is being stalked by his own character. He brought Freddy back one last time in 2003 for Freddy vs Jason, where Krueger and fellow horror icon Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) from Friday the 13th are both resurrected and sent to hell. Best place for them. It’s a role that has certainly kept the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art-trained US actor in business, as well as in demand for a constant flow of A Nightmare on Elm Street documentaries. It’s also had a spin-off effect for work in other horror movies: Killer Tongue, Wishmaster, The Mangler and Zombie Strippers. Englund is in the current British horror film Choose or Die, with Asa “Sex Education” Butterfield and Eddie Marsan – about an 80s-style text adventure game that comes to life and starts killing people. Again, Englund plays a fictionalised version of himself as the voice of the evil adventure game. Scary.

5/17/2022,"When you name what you think is the ultimate Kay Mellor show, really all you’re naming is your own vintage. To the scriptwriter and director, who died suddenly on Sunday aged 71, there was no “ultimate”. Mellor brought the same urgency, vividness and deceptively light social critique to every project. You could never guess the tone from her subject matter: for instance, her childrens’ TV drama Children’s Ward – co-created with Paul Abbott in 1989 and set in a hospital in Bolton – sounds like a classic tearjerker, a triumph-over-adversity tale with intermittent dignity-in-the-face-of-tragedy. It was anything but – caustic and edgy, constantly butting up against Granada executives for including such adult themes (sex offenders, HIV) in a YA drama. The dog kennel season of BBC lottery drama The Syndicate, which would be the last thing she wrote (and starred her own shih tzu, Happy) should have been a breeze, full of fluff and fur and kids rolling in unexpected dosh. In fact, it was a searching examination of life on zero hours. She never overworked an idea, but didn’t flinch from its implications either; she never used 10 words where five would say it. As a result, she covered a huge amount of the human condition, and changed the way TV was written – its scope, depth and ambition. Born in Leeds, Mellor had her first daughter – producer Yvonne Francas – at 17, and her second, the actor Gaynor Faye, three years later. Her formal education wasn’t completed, was barely even begun, until her daughters were school age, when she went back to finish her O and A Levels. It was anything but a teenage-pregnancy disaster story: the marriage she entered into at 17, to Anthony Mellor, lasted; the journey from drama school to fringe theatre, as a writer, actor and director, to writing soaps and dramas, was fast and apparently seamless. But her accelerated responsibilities left her with little patience for writer’s rooms full of powerful, wealthy, completely feckless men trying to conjure the lives of working-class women from a bag of cliches. She got her first TV break writing for Coronation Street from the mid-80s. She used to say you could tell an all-male writing team if any female character with kids is casually doing any activity other than seeing to the kids. After Corrie, as a staff writer at Granada, she wrote for Dramarama, the episodic kids’ show which spawned Children’s Ward, from an episode too good to leave as a single. By the early 90s, she was given free hand to create a daytime soap, Families, which largely left its stamp by the careers it launched. It was Jude Law’s first recurring TV role; Russell T Davies wrote for it (having worked on Children’s Ward). That pattern was repeated in Fat Friends, which aired in 2000, and followed a weight-loss group with a wit and humanity that made stars of Ruth Jones and James Corden. She’d spotted Corden in a Tango ad and loved his energy – which, if you watch the ad, is some spot.Band of Gold, which Mellor created in 1995, and wrote with Mark Davies-Markham and Catherine Johnson for the next five years, was an ensemble piece about female friendships, dressed up as a gritty crime drama about sex workers, and drew out some beautiful performances, particularly from Geraldine James and a then-unknown Samantha Morton. Mellor still occasionally acted, throughout her writing career, in her own adaptation of Jane Eyre in the late 90s, and the dramedy Stan the Man in 2002. Those early days setting up a theatre company and doing everything, from directing to acting to slightly haphazard (by her account) budgeting, stayed with her in a marked lack of grandness or preciousness, as well as in her themes and interests. She wrote A Passionate Woman as a play about her mother’s unhappy marriage and doomed affair, which became a BBC mini-series, and – like so much of her work – was partly a love letter to Leeds. Steven Spielberg once congratulated her on a season of The Syndicate, its sense of community and place, and she replied: “I think that even when I write dark stuff it’s got a hidden warmth to it and maybe that is the Yorkshireness. That Northern side of people.” Mellor was much recognised, a fellow of the Royal Television Society, with an OBE and Writers Guild awards, but she had a huge influence it would be hard to express with a prize. She never moved from Leeds, and she never forgot, she said last year, “what it’s like to not have enough money to get to the end of the week. I’ve experienced that first hand, so it’s easy for me to write that.” Without that perspective, drama can feel rather thin. Needless to say, that’s not a problem Mellor ever suffered from.",Arts/Television & radio,‘She changed the way TV was written’: Zoe Williams on Kay Mellor,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/17/she-changed-the-way-tv-was-written-zoe-williams-on-kay-mellor
5/17/2022,"Alleged inconsistencies in the way the UK Home Office and Foreign Office process asylum applications from vulnerable judges in hiding in Afghanistan are being challenged at the high court on Tuesday. If successful, the three separate judicial reviews will require the Home Office to undertake a wholesale rethink of how it is handling cases. The reviews – anonymised to protect the claimants from persecution by the Taliban – cover a male judge and a female judge who have had their applications for asylum rejected, and a prominent female women’s rights activist. A 45-strong network of mainly commercial UK lawyers have been representing 28 Afghan judges applying for asylum. The Afghans are just a small proportion of 800 or so judges who worked in Afghanistan before the Taliban takeover last year, more than a quarter of whom are female. They say inconsistencies on the part of the UK’s approach are unreasonable, incoherent and arbitrary. “It is quite extraordinary given that we filed these applications in October, and started submitting evidence immediately afterwards, and it is now May and these cases have not been decided,” said Sheena Buddhdev, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland providing pro bono advice. “Some of them [the judges] are in a very precarious position. These cases are urgent.” Buddhdev said many judges were facing a direct threat because of their connections to the UK. “All of them face a real risk to their life due to the work they did to promote democracy and the rule of law, something that was a formal UK government objective.” She added it had been very hard to gather evidence and present claims, given that some are in hiding and face language difficulties. In one of the complaints being aired in court, the claimants say guidance for immigration staff did not make provision for the fact that applicants could not make the perilous journey to a UK visa application centre to provide biometric information because no such centres exist in Afghanistan. The claimants say they were advised by UK government officials to work around this by not telling the truth on their application forms. Subsequently the Home Office has advised claimants to amend their application to make it clear they cannot provide the biometric information required, resulting in further delays. The claimants says the people whose applications have been rejected have a similar profile in terms of fear of reprisals and their relationship to UK security objectives as those called forward in Operation Pitting, the emergency Ministry of Defence operation before the fall of Kabul to the Taliban that led to 15,000 people being airlifted. Of the 28 Afghan judges whose cases are being handled by the network of lawyers, only one of has made it to the UK. Nineteen are still in Afghanistan, and the rest are in third countries, such as Sweden and Pakistan. Buddhdev said: “In a period of seven months we have two decisions. Little or no reason is given for a rejection. It is a frustratingly slow lack of progress. Many of them are in hiding, only able to move at night, moving from place to place, and the Taliban seem to be more confident about what repression they can impose.” Some of the commercial lawyers, unused to handling refugee cases, say they have been shocked by the opaque nature of the application system and the length of the Home Office delays. They claim Britain’s reputation as a country that honours its debts is at stake. The government operates two different settlement schemes: the Afghanistan Relocation and Assistance Policy for those who worked alongside the UK government, including in the Ministry of Defence, and the much-delayed Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme, which is due to resettle 20,000 people over the next few years. Of the 20,000 applications under the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Programme, just 7,000 have been processed in the past six months. The scheme opened in April 2021 as a means of helping Afghan citizens who assisted the British military to leave with their families after the Taliban takeover, including former translators and local staff. A UK government spokesperson said: “We undertook the UK’s biggest and fastest emergency evacuation in recent history, helping over 15,000 people to safety from Afghanistan who we are continuing to support. “The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK.”",News/UK news,"Afghan judges hoping for UK asylum not treated consistently, say lawyers",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/afghan-judges-hoping-for-uk-asylum-not-treated-consistently-say-lawyers
5/17/2022,"Rules for wearing face masks while travelling abroad remain complex for British holidaymakers as EU nations adopt differing approaches. The European Union announced that from Monday (16 May), masks would no longer be required for passengers on flights to many EU countries. The announcement coincided with one from the French health minister, stating that masks will no longer be required on trains, planes and metros in France. However, major destinations for UK holidaymakers, including Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain, are keeping the mask rule. Italy said passengers are required to wear more-protective FFP2 masks on public transport until 15 June. In Spain, restrictions that came into force in July 2020 were due to be lifted on 15 May, but last Saturday, Spain’s Ministry of the Interior said this was being postponed to midnight on 15 June. Last week, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) issued an update to the health safety measures for air travel. They dropped the recommendation for mandatory wearing of masks in airports and flights, while noting that a mask is still one of the best protections against the transmission of Covid-19. “From next week, masks will no longer need to be mandatory in air travel in all cases, broadly aligning with the changing requirements of national authorities across Europe for public transport,” said EASA executive director Patrick Ky. “For passengers and aircrews, this is a big step forward in the normalisation of air travel. Passengers should however behave responsibly and respect the choices of others around them. And a passenger who is coughing and sneezing should strongly consider wearing a mask, for the reassurance of those seated nearby.” However, holidaymakers will still need to check rules for individual countries and airlines as rules continue to vary: Ryanair has dropped the requirement for masks but easyJet says masks are optional on a small number of flights but required in most cases.",Lifestyle/Travel,Do I need a mask to fly?

5/17/2022,"The chairman of Marks & Spencer has backed government plans to override parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, saying that some food exported south of the border now requires 700 pages of customs documents, partly written in Latin. Archie Norman, a former Conservative MP, called on the UK government and EU to come to an agreement, saying the rules for sending food between them were “highly bureaucratic and pretty pointless” given that British food standards were in line with or higher than those of Brussels. Norman said: “At the moment, wagons arriving in the Republic of Ireland have to carry 700 pages of documentation it takes eight hours to prepare the documentation some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be written in Latin. It has to be in a certain typeface.” He said the UK government’s proposal to override parts of the agreement signed as part of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal and remove checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea was a “triumph of common sense over rules-based mentality” and “will make sure at a time of inflation that the Northern Ireland people can get the fresh food they are used to and are entitled to”. Norman told the BBC that since Brexit, exporting to Ireland now took 30% more driver time and required the employment of 13 vets in Motherwell, Scotland, to oversee the required checks and paperwork, costing M&S an additional £30m. “It’s very onerous,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The protocol requires similar rules to be imposed on goods travelling between mainland UK and Northern Ireland because of its border with the Republic of Ireland, but the checks are currently being held off under a series of “easements”. Removing those easements would mean “that every piece of butter in a sandwich has to have an EU vet’s certificate”, Norman said. “The EU are looking for us to impose comparable controls for Northern Ireland and were that to happen it would mean that quite a lot of products from the UK simply wouldn’t get to Northern Ireland and what does go there would be very very costly,” Norman said. “Marks & Spencer is a big company, we can make almost anything work, however bureaucratic, but for the small artisan cheesemaker or cake baker it would simply be impossible to export any more.” Norman said an EU proposal that every product going from the UK mainland to Northern Ireland must be specifically labelled as only for consumption in the UK, for example, would cost M&S £9m a year alone. He said finding a solution was important in the light of food price inflation which was likely to reach 8% to 10% by the end of this year. The M&S chair said British consumers were still spending, having built up savings during the pandemic, but warned: “The crunch is not going to be now, the crunch is going to be in the autumn when people come back from their holidays so have spent their money and there is nothing left in the kitty.” The preference for M&S is that the UK and EU agree to maintain equivalent food standards so checks would not be required. “Our food standards are probably the highest in the world and therefore we should recognise that and let the product flow not just into Northern Ireland but into France and the [Irish] Republic,” Norman said. “The UK government has been very wary of that. To some extent there has been a hankering after the idea that there might be some opportunity of Brexit, a chance to deviate in the future and the EU of course hasn’t really been prepared to contemplate it.”",News/Business,M&S chair attacks ‘pointless’ post-Brexit rules for Northern Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/17/ms-chair-brexit-northern-ireland-archie-norman-uk
5/17/2022,"A senior official from African football’s governing body attempted to intervene in a state investigation into whether the president of the Gabonese Football Federation (Fegafoot) covered up widespread sexual abuse, the Guardian can reveal. Pierre-Alain Mounguengui was indicted and placed under a committal order in Libreville last week for “failure to report crimes of paedophilia” having been arrested last month after allegations first made in the Guardian. He could face up to three years in prison if found guilty of not reporting to the authorities alleged sexual abuse by a number coaches. There is no suggestion Mounguengui – who was re-elected as Fegafoot’s president for a third term on 16 April – has been accused of sexual abuse himself. He has not commented on the charges. In a letter to the Gabonese sports minister, Franck Nguema, dated 28 April, Véron Mosengo-Omba – the general secretary of the Confederation of African Football (Caf) – alleges that Mounguengui’s arrest two weeks after he was re-elected “is a disturbing coincidence” and evidence of “a new attempt to remove Mr Mounguengui from the management of Fegafoot”. “While sharing the concern of the Gabonese state to investigate seriously in the event of suspicion of attacks committed in the exercise of football, Caf wonders in particular about the real reasons that have justifies the arrest of President Mounguengui and on those who would still justify his continued detention after questioning,” it reads. “This arrest is perceived as a new attempt to remove Mr Mounguengui from the management of Fegafoot. Indeed, we are still awaiting the complete report of our delegates dispatched on the spot before and during the elections, but we know that irregular procedures have already been used to harm him before the elections. We are counting on the fact that President Mounguengui is and will be treated in accordance with applicable law and quickly released – if this has not already been done – if no sufficient charge justifies his detention. I ask you to accept.” Nguema wrote back on 3 May – four days before Mounguengui appeared in court to face charges – and pointed out that their first interview with the Fegafoot president concerning the investigation had taken place in December, more than three months before the elections. “As you can see, the legal proceedings against Mr. Mounguengui, initiated on 21/12/2021, are on the one hand triggered by the revelations of the newspaper The Guardian (16/12/2021), and on the other hand, well before the election of the executive Bureau of Fegafoot (16/04/2022),” wrote Nguema. “In Gabon, as in other democratic countries, the independence of justice is affirmed because of the principle of the separation of powers. From this point of view, it is not up to the government to instruct the justice to quickly release Mr. Mounguengui, as suggested by the Caf by your care. Also, only the justice remains competent to decide whether or not to release Mr. Mounguengui, depending on the results of the criminal investigations in progress.” In a statement, a Caf spokesperson told the Guardian that it had contacted the government because of concerns that the elections had not been conducted fairly. “Caf has a duty to raise pertinent questions at times and seek clarity on matters and this is no different,” he said. “In the case of President Pierre-Alain Mounguengui, we have maintained a clear position: that if there is a case for him to answer, that should be dealt with. We have been studying the context of what transpired in Gabon both before the football leadership elections and after. We have also received a report from the Caf delegation sent to the country. For now, the content of these reports is not yet made public but we remain available to discuss it with the government of Gabon, relevant stakeholders and football leadership in Gabon. “In the last few months, Caf has engaged a number of governments in the continent whenever there have been challenges relating to football and football leaders in the particular countries. This situation is no different.” Kenya’s and Zimbabwe’s football associations were suspended by Fifa in February because of governmental interference and it is understood that is among the measures being considered for Gabon. Before joining Caf in March 2021, Mosengo-Omba was in charge of establishing normalisation committees in several African countries including Cameroon and Egypt as part of his role as chief officer of the Fifa member associations. But a spokesperson for the international players’ union Fifpro said Caf’s behaviour was “highly inappropriate”. “The evidence gathered by the relevant domestic authorities was apparently deemed sufficient to detain Mr Mounguengui, who has been the president of the Gabon Football Federation for several years, a period of time that coincided with the occurrence of the widespread abuse,” he said. “It is critical that sport’s governing bodies respect the independence and the process of the criminal justice system, while ensuring that sporting sanctions are imposed according to their own ethics and disciplinary standards and based on their own investigations. Invoking a so-called prohibition on ‘political interference’ by a government in this case is not only a breach of decent governance but may adversely affect the victims and survivors, for whom sport governing bodies share a responsibility of care.”",Sport/Football,Caf official tried to intervene after arrest of Gabon FA chief accused of abuse cover-up,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/17/caf-official-tried-to-intervene-after-arrest-of-gabon-fa-chief-accused-of-abuse-cover-up
5/17/2022,"Amid the hopelessness of Arsenal’s offering at Newcastle on Monday there was a five-minute spell midway through the first half when it seemed they might, just might, have come to their senses. Unsurprisingly, Bukayo Saka was behind it: a darting run on to a give-and-go with Martin Ødegaard was straight out of his playbook but Dan Burn blocked the attempted finish; then there was a nip inside and a low shot that, although reasonably struck, did not overly trouble Martin Dubravka. Had Saka given Arsenal’s Champions League hopes fresh life from one of those glimmers, it would have been his 13th goal of the season in all competitions. He could yet add to his tally at home to Everton on Sunday but given he leads their goalscoring charts, mental gymnastics are not required to understand the problem. In peacetime football, only one of Arsenal’s top scorers, Brian Kidd in 1975-76, has managed fewer than 12; on the previous occasion, in 1912-13, Charles Lewis scored four and Arsenal were relegated. Nowadays, their concerns are loftier but a lack of potency is the primary issue for Mikel Arteta to address this summer. When he flung on Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pépé after Ben White’s own goal, having already deployed Gabriel Martinelli from the bench, it was hard to believe these were changes that would tip the scales. Necessary surgery has been performed on Arsenal’s defence over the past two years but on nights like Monday, when both centre-halves were hardly match fit and Newcastle asked constant questions, their inefficiency further forward is laid bare. A counter-argument to the focus on a top scorer is that good teams share goals around. Arsenal can claim to have done that: Emile Smith Rowe, whose drop in output has been among their inconveniences, sits one goal behind Saka and 14 players have scored in the league this season. But only Wolves, of the division’s top nine, have managed fewer in total and it inevitably means Arsenal must sweat for their rewards. There has been an overreliance in general on Saka, who has looked exhausted at times in recent weeks. He provides so much of Arsenal’s spark but has been carrying knocks, flitting in and out of their past four games when he can so often be depended upon to set the bar. When he is out of tune, Arteta is forced to look at his other forwards more in hope than expectation. Martinelli is a scintillating talent and showed it again when tormenting Leeds’s Luke Ayling into a red card 10 days ago; he is also an emphatic finisher but has scored once in his past 21 appearances and there is a sense that, from his standard perch on the left, he is yet to find the ideal balance between penalty-area threat and wider involvement. Lacazette briefly earned gushing reviews in December when showing the leadership Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had abdicated, if not the goal return of his friend, but that was a passing fancy and he will depart with little fanfare this summer. Eddie Nketiah preys clinically on opponents’ mistakes but is less effective when asked to bind a forward line from the middle. He was one of Arsenal’s more willing performers at St James’ Park but Callum Wilson showed him how it is done and, while the academy product is understandably admired by the fanbase, they require better. A new contract is on the table but a fresh start will surely be his most likely source of regular football. Pépé’s recent contributions as a substitute have been risible. Unless Tottenham drop the mother of all clangers at Carrow Road on Sunday, Arsenal’s top-four quest will run aground on the thinness of a squad not augmented in January with one or two key signings to push them over the line. Injuries to Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey have exposed a lack of backup quality in other areas; their patchiness in attack has been an enduring problem over the season, though, and will be the main area of focus for any postmortem. It will not be news to Arteta, who was relatively candid when it was pointed out in December that they had no reliable centre-forward option for the long-term. “We have a cloud and the cloud is there and, at the moment, we’re not able to change it,” he said. Five months on it has still not shifted and, in a crowded market that will include the Saudi-funded arrivistes who showed them up on Monday, Arsenal face a battle to land the top-quality additions that are called for. They must win it and they must also fend off any attempts to turn Saka’s head. His contract expires in two years and the last thing Arsenal need is a saga engulfing their prize asset, who was lost in contemplation as he left the pitch on Monday. Saka is as grounded as they come and would suck up a season in the Europa League, especially as Arsenal’s progress is obvious and tangible despite the gripes; what he would feel about the same in 12 months’ time, with the best years of his career approaching, is another question. “I just can’t believe how we performed today,” he said once he had gathered his thoughts; Arteta must help him out by moulding a front line that he, let alone anyone else, can have faith in.",Sport/Football,Arsenal’s striking shortage laid bare as fourth place slips from their grasp | Nick Ames,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/17/arsenal-striking-shortage-laid-bare-as-fourth-place-slips-from-their-grasp
5/17/2022,"The EU could impose tariffs on UK fish and agricultural goods in just seven days if Boris Johnson goes ahead with moves to disapply parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, legal experts have said. The short, sharp shock is one of the three key retaliatory weapons available through the trade agreement, according to Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law at Cambridge University. 1. The nuclear option – end the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) using articles 770 and 779 These clauses allow the EU to terminate the entire trade agreement, spelling the end of tariff-free trade in both directions along with all the other elements of the deal, including 90-day visa-free holidays, and the fishing agreement. It would essentially return the UK to a no-deal Brexit scenario, with damaging consequences including the suspension of police and security cooperation, a serious move with long-term consequences for EU-UK relations. As this requires a year’s notice, it may not appeal to member states who want to show they have real teeth in the face of what they consider an act of bad faith by the UK. 2. Finger-on-the-button option – article 521 This would allow the EU to suspend the trade parts of the TCA, leaving all the other areas agreed last December, including visa-free holidays and police cooperation, intact. Again, this option may not appeal to member states as it would not deliver the practical objectives to demonstrate that the EU has teeth. “It seems to me unlikely that they would do this because, frankly, if things have got so bad that the EU is talking about terminating part of the treaty it seems unlikely that they carry on cooperating in the other areas,” says Barnard. 3. Trade war in a week – article 506, paragraph 2 This allows the EU to “suspend, in whole or in part”, access to its waters. Such a response may have nothing to do with Northern Ireland, but Barnard says: “The advantage from the EU’s point of view is that you only have to give seven days’ notice,” so a trade war could be started within a week. Moreover, article 506 allows for wider retaliation if deemed necessary. If the EU considers a suspension of fishing around the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man “commensurate to the economic or societal impact of the alleged failure” of the UK to comply with the threat, it can suspend tariff-free trade “in whole or in part”. In other words, it could slap tariffs on fish and other goods within seven days. Is it an either/or situation? The treaty governing current trading arrangements – the trade and cooperation agreement – gives considerable powers to either side to terminate the relationship. Barnard says: “They [the EU] could do them all at the same time but it is more likely that they may try to escalate matters.” For the EU to be considering pressing the button on any of the options just 18 months after the UK left the bloc with a trade deal is remarkable in the history of trade disputes. “If you look at the World Trade Organization, the number of disputes between states is relatively small,” Barnard says. “The whole purpose of dispute resolution mechanisms is to resolve arguments, and that’s why you have those provisions in the withdrawal agreement and the TCA. But instead of talking about resolution, we are talking about ratcheting up the arguments to the point of terminating the treaty. It is extraordinary.”",News/Politics,Three ways EU could respond to UK ditching Northern Ireland protocol,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/three-ways-eu-could-respond-to-uk-ditching-northern-ireland-protocol
5/17/2022,"Schrödinger’s cat is old hat. Let me introduce a new thought experiment: Schrödinger’s Palestinian. As a Palestinian, you are told constantly that you may think you exist, but, really, you don’t. I am Palestinian (I used to say half-Palestinian, through my father, but now I refuse to slice myself in half) and have been told this several times. My favourite example was when a colleague heard about my heritage and informed me that, “semantically speaking”, there was no such thing as a Palestinian and no such thing as Palestine. Well, there is no arguing with semantics, is there? I disappeared into a puff of air right then and there. Palestinians don’t exist – except, of course, when we are militants or gunmen or terrorists or Hamas. There is no disputing our existence then – no disputing our terrorising nature or our savagery. There is no disputing our existence when we are targets for condemnation. We exist when we are being criticised; we cease to exist when it comes to human rights. There is no peace in Israel/Palestine because Palestinians are terrorists who don’t want peace, one pervasive narrative goes. But there is also no peace because Palestinians are imaginary and Palestine is made up. We exist, but we don’t. It’s complicated! Why am saying all this? Because it is difficult to understand just how devastating the killing of the journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh was – the way it shook Palestinians to the core – without understanding what it is like to be Palestinian. Being Palestinian means having the validity of your existence litigated every single day. It means constantly being gaslit, erased, talked over, smeared. For diaspora Palestinians like me, it means getting used to being looked at with suspicion simply for answering the question: ‘Where are you from?’ When my family moved to New York when I was a kid, for example, a person on our building’s board heard my dad was Palestinian and “jokingly” told him not to hold any terrorist meetings in the apartment. (As if! You always hold monthly militant meetings on the roof.) When I went to law school in London, I was subjected to “joke” after “joke” about suicide bombers. Anti-Palestinian bigotry is so normalised and widespread that, when strangers ask me where I am from, I am often wary (and scared) of mentioning Palestine. Shireen Abu Aqleh had no such qualms; she was courage personified. The much-loved Al Jazeera correspondent was a fixture on TV screens for more than three decades, signing off her broadcasts with the refrain: “I am Shireen Abu Aqleh, Jerusalem, occupied Palestine.” No mincing of words, no apologies for existing; just the truth. Abu Aqleh was far more than a journalist, far more than a household name. Even “icon” doesn’t capture her. She was a documentarian of displacement, a voice for Palestinians, a symbol of Palestine. She was a constant reminder that Palestinians are not an abstract philosophical concept whose existence is up for debate, but human beings deserving of dignity. For diaspora Palestinians, she was a lifeline. And now she is gone. Abu Aqleh isn’t just dead; she has been desecrated. Her memory was dishonoured by fellow journalists who reported her death with the passive voice, diluted her death with references to “clashes” and gave more credence to constantly shifting narratives from the Israeli government than eyewitness accounts. Her killing last week, during an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, was diminished by western politicians offering meaningless platitudes rather than demanding real accountability. Her funeral was disturbed by Israeli police who beat mourners and tried to snatch the flag from her hearse. It wasn’t enough for the voice of Palestine to be dead; the imagery of Palestine had to disappear, too. And this, by the way, is far from unusual. I remember Israeli soldiers coming to my dad’s village when I was a child and violently confiscating the Palestinian flag flying there. Were they allowed to do this? Schrodinger’s Palestinian! They were and they weren’t. One of the funniest corrections I have ever seen is from the Washington Post in 2021: “An earlier version of this article said that Israel bans the Palestinian flag. It has banned the flag in certain situations in the past, but today the flag can be confiscated and the flying of it penalised under Israeli public safety ordinances.” The best way I can honour Abu Aqleh’s memory is to ask you to consider this: if the violence that happened at a beloved Palestinian’s funeral took place when the Israeli government knew the world was watching, what do you think happens to ordinary Palestinians the rest of the time? The violence documented at Abu Aqleh’s funeral wasn’t an aberration; it was just another day under occupation.

5/17/2022,"North Korea stands on the brink of a Covid-19 catastrophe unless swift action is taken to provide vaccines and drug treatments, experts have said, as the number of people reported to have fallen ill rose to almost 1.5 million. The isolated country reported another big rise in new cases of what it continues to refer to as “fever” on Tuesday, days after it admitted it had identified Covid-19 infections for the first time since the start of the global pandemic. It recorded 269,510 additional cases and six more deaths, bringing the total number killed to 56 since late last month. About 1.48 million people have become ill with the virus since the first case was reported last Thursday and at least 663,910 people were in quarantine, according to official figures. The outbreak is almost certainly greater than the official tally, given a lack of tests and resources to monitor and treat the sick. A significant Covid-19 outbreak could unleash a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, where the economy has been battered by the pandemic-enforced closure of its border with China – its main trading partner – natural disasters, and years of international sanctions imposed in response to ballistic missile tests. The regime is not thought to have vaccinated any of its population and does not have access to antiviral drugs that have been used to treat Covid-19 in other countries. Its hospitals have few intensive-care resources to treat severe cases, and widespread malnourishment has made the population of 26 million more susceptible to serious illness. “It looks really bad,” said Owen Miller, a lecturer in Korean studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University. “They are facing the rampant spread of Omicron without protection from vaccines, without much – if any – immunity in the population and without access to most of the drugs that have been used to treat Covid elsewhere.” Offers of outside help have so far been met with silence. Instead, there is concern that the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, may be willing to accept a large but “manageable” number of cases and deaths to avoid opening his country up to international scrutiny. Since it reported its first cases last week, North Korea’s propaganda machine has portrayed the virus as an enemy that can be defeated through lockdowns, quarantine and greater vigilance. The state-run KCNA news agency has reported the delivery of unspecified drugs – “the elixir of life” – to pharmacies by army medical units, and public health campaigns calling for mask-wearing and social distancing. But testing levels are far below what is needed to form an accurate picture of the outbreak and to quickly identify and isolate patients. Some observers speculated that authorities were deliberately underreporting cases to ease the pressure on Kim. North Korea has tested just 64,200 people since the start of the pandemic’s start, according to the World Health Organization, compared with 172 million in the neighbouring South. “We were talking about a 0.1% fatality rate for Omicron in South Korea, but that’s going to be significantly higher in North Korea, possibly even reaching 1%, although it’s difficult to make accurate predictions at this point,” said Jung Jae-hun, a professor of preventive medicine at Gachon University. Kim, who says the outbreak is causing “great turmoil”, finds himself having to balance public health measures with efforts to revive the crumbling economy. A ruling party member in North Hamgyong province said people were still going to work and markets remained open, reported the Japan-based Asia Press. “There are no bans on going outside. However, we’ve been ordered to double mask,” the unidentified official told the website, which receives information from citizen journalists equipped with contraband Chinese mobile phones. “People are going to factories and to their places of work as normal. The authorities don’t want work to be disrupted. People get fever checks when they go to and from work.” The official said people were more concerned about being locked down and prevented from working than catching Covid-19. “People are worried about how to survive.” Some initially interpreted North Korea’s admission that it was battling the virus – after two years of denying it had found a single case – as a plea for help. But it has already refused millions of vaccine doses via the UN-backed Covax scheme, while South Korea says it has yet to receive a response to its offer this week of vaccines, drugs and medical staff. “I’m sure the North Koreans will still be very wary of accepting major international aid and going back to the situation of the 1990s, when there were multiple different aid agencies operating in the country and this was felt by the leadership to be humiliating and potentially destabilising,” Miller said, adding that the regime was more likely to turn to China for medical aid. The Omicron variant has caused significantly fewer deaths and serious cases than previous strains in countries with high vaccination rates, proper medical services and previous exposure to Covid-19. But that pattern is unlikely to be repeated in North Korea, said Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Korea University College of Medicine in Seoul. “North Korea has many vulnerable people who don’t have strong immune systems,” he said. “Its official inoculation rate is zero and it has no Covid-19 treatment pills.” Without urgent international help, Kim added, “North Korea may end up with the pandemic’s worst death and infection rates in the world for its population size.” Wires in Seoul contributed reporting.",News/World news,"North Korea on brink of Covid-19 catastrophe, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/north-korea-on-brink-of-covid-19-catastrophe-say-experts
5/17/2022,"“Are you sure you want to see him?” I asked Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in March, after we received an invitation to meet the prime minister, Boris Johnson. Anoosheh Ashoori, who was also detained in Iran – in his case in 2017 – and released alongside Nazanin in March has so far turned down his own invitation, calling it opportunistic, and I wondered if Nazanin felt similarly. I’ll admit I was surprised to be included in the invitation to No 10. I hadn’t exactly minced my words about the government’s handling of Nazanin’s case. “Yes, I want to tell him what happened to me,” she replied. We later discussed what we wanted to raise: Morad Tahbaz’s case; the issue of hostage-taking; and the forthcoming select committee inquiry into her case. Nazanin also reiterated that she wanted Johnson to know how his blunder in 2017, where he incorrectly stated that she had been “training journalists” in Iran, had affected her. Finally the day came, and the family and I were ushered into No 10. Niceties were exchanged and Johnson gave Nazanin’s seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella, a puzzle, which she promptly started putting together in the corner of the room. There was little time for small talk. After graciously thanking him for paying the historic £400m debt that Britain owed Iran, Nazanin asked why it had taken six long years to do so, adding that her interrogators had made clear from her second week in prison that this was the price of her freedom. Johnson looked decidedly uncomfortable, saying that making the actual payment had been “complicated”. Undeterred, Nazanin kept going. She said his words in 2017 were constantly used against her; that her interrogators tormented her, insisting that her own foreign secretary knew she was guilty; and that she was reminded of this until the very last day she left Iran. “I lived in the shadow of your words for four-and-a-half years, prime minister.” There was pin-drop silence in the room. I watched Johnson intently and waited for an apology. And waited. After a pause, Nazanin went on to share courageously some of what she was subjected to during her incarceration – that the guards told her they would kill her and bury her; that she would never see her daughter again; the solitary confinement room that set off her claustrophobia; being driven to hunger strikes. “If you ripped my skin off, you would see the deep scars on my soul,” she said. What struck me most was how eloquently and calmly Nazanin came across. She was in control, speaking with brutal honesty but from the heart. It was impressive to watch. Having been in the world of politics for a long time, I know how difficult it can be to speak truth to power, especially in an imposing setting like No 10. Nazanin is an ordinary citizen who was a guest of the prime minister, in his house, and she broke all the conventions. She did it because she has nothing to lose. As she pointed out, she already lost six years of her life for a crime she didn’t commit, missing a significant part of her daughter’s childhood. Nazanin also asked the prime minister whether he would provide evidence to the foreign affairs select committee inquiry. He said he would “look into the options” for doing so. He sounded positive, which was encouraging, so I will continue to push for this. I sincerely hope the inquiry will get to the bottom of why it took six years to pay a legitimate debt – a decision that could have been taken in 2016 and saved Nazanin six years of imprisonment. I want to know why ministers failed to resolve this for so long and tried so hard to hide the reasons from parliament and the public. The inquiry must also shed light on why the government still refuses to acknowledge Iran’s hostage-taking and why British citizens like Morad Tahbaz are still imprisoned in Iran, despite the deal to get him released on furlough. Our government is clearly getting this profoundly wrong; Nazanin and others who are suffering as a result deserve to know why. As we left No 10, Nazanin revealed that she felt guilty “every day” that detainees like Morad Tahbaz were still incarcerated while she was roaming around London freely. She said she wouldn’t rest until they were freed. I marvelled at this incredible woman’s tenacity. While I am grateful for the time the prime minister gave us, we have been asked many times since whether he apologised in the end. No. He didn’t say sorry to Nazanin. He actually didn’t say anything at all in that regard. His silence made me wonder whether he has ever been spoken to like that before, or ever been held accountable so directly. Was he completely caught off guard? While Nazanin didn’t ask for an apology, I personally struggle to understand why Johnson didn’t take the opportunity to apologise for a mistake he had definitely made. Anyone else I know would have. Did he simply believe that Nazanin, who paid the price for Britain’s historic debt, was going to come into his house, thank him profusely, drink tea and leave? Perhaps a simple sorry could have brought Nazanin some closure in her unimaginable ordeal.

5/17/2022,"The Bath Festival Orchestra was established by Yehudi Menuhin in 1959, when he began his 10-festival tenure as director. It has now been relaunched under the baton of Peter Manning, and aims to invoke the status and reputation of the original group while offering a platform for emerging talents. However, it would seem from this showing at this year’s Bath festival, even factoring in pandemic issues and delays, that the orchestra has some way to go before it can match some of the extravagant claims made for it. There was already something faintly surreal about an evening of music for strings inspired by the sea taking place in the city’s ancient Roman Baths, even if the screeching of gulls, wheeling and turning overhead, contributed to the conceit. And, although all four pieces had titles specifying their maritime connection, the combination of established works with new didn’t come together as a neat flotilla. Opening the programme was Takemitsu’s 1981 Toward the Sea, commissioned by Greenpeace for its Save the Whales campaign and referencing Herman Melville’s Moby Dick – its consciousness-raising purpose arguably even more necessary today. Takemitsu’s inclusion of the sensuous alto flute (Frederico Paixão) and harp (Alis Huws) with the string texture gives the piece its distinctly French aura but, the playing of the strings – 16 in number – lacked the character to invest the music with the meditative element that is part of its fundamental quality. US composer Daniel Temkin’s Ocean’s Call, premiered in 2015, was inspired by the immensity of the Pacific and California’s Big Sur. As a percussionist, Temkin might have been expected to concern himself with rhythmic sensibilities, but these were not apparent and, given the overwhelming feeling that had inspired the piece, it was underwhelming and insipid. Visions at Sea (2011) by the Dutch composer Joey Roukens was, like the Temkin, first conceived for string quartet. Ostensibly conveying a sense of the Netherlands’ relationship with the sea over time, it patched into the fabric quotes from the past, together with bits of traditional hornpipe and sea-songs. Yet, with its mix of tonal and atonal elements, it never quite achieved an organic whole. Between these two relatively recent works came Grace Williams’s 1944 work Sea Sketches. Eliciting the strings’ most robust playing of the evening, there were also expressive moments that suggested the ensemble’s ultimate viability but, overall, this was a disappointing occasion.
