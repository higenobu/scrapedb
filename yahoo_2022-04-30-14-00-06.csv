4/30/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's foreign spy chief accused the United States and Poland on Thursday of plotting to gain a sphere of influence in Ukraine, a claim denied by Warsaw as disinformation aimed at sowing distrust among Kyiv's supporters. Sergei Naryshkin, the chief of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), cited unpublished intelligence that he said showed the United States and Poland, NATO allies, were plotting to restore Polish control over part of western Ukraine. ""According to the intelligence received by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, Washington and Warsaw are working on plans to establish Poland's tight military and political control over its historical possessions in Ukraine,"" Naryshkin said in a rare statement released by the SVR. Poland denied the claim and said it was disinformation spread by Moscow. ""The lies about Poland's alleged plans to attack western Ukraine have been repeated for several years,"" said Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesman for Poland's special services coordinator. ""The aim of Russian propaganda is to foster distrust between Ukraine and Poland, to undermine PL-UA cooperation."" Poland has ruled some territories that are now part of Ukraine at different times in the past, most recently between the two world wars. Western Ukraine, including the city of Lviv, were absorbed into the Soviet Union at the end of World War Two. The SVR said the United States was discussing with Poland a plan under which Polish ""peacekeeping"" forces without a NATO mandate would enter parts of western Ukraine where the chance of a confrontation with Russian forces was low. The SVR, which after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union took on most of the Soviet-era KGB's foreign spying responsibilities, did not publish its evidence, and Reuters was unable to verify the accusation. Poland is one of Ukraine's strongest supporters in its resistance to Russia's invasion, sending weapons across the border and taking in around three million Ukrainian refugees. A senior Russian lawmaker, Senator Andrei Klimov, deputy chair of the Federation Council's Foreign Affairs Committee, also said on Thursday that Poland was planning to establish control over part of Ukraine. He gave no evidence for the claim. Russia has been signaling for days that the conflict could end with a forced partition of Ukraine. One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies said this week that Ukraine was spiraling toward a collapse into several states because of what he cast as a U.S. attempt to use Kyiv to undermine Russia. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West says this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression by Putin.

4/30/2022,"Video posted online this week by the Los Angeles Police Department shows two officers approach a man they believed was armed with a gun in South L.A. in March and immediately shoot him. Jose Barrera, 45, did not have a gun or any other weapon, but was holding a black cellphone and waving it around. He survived. The shooting is the latest in which LAPD officers opened fire after misjudging the threat posed by an individual, in part based on inaccurate claims from others — including 911 callers — that the people were brandishing firearms. In the video from Barrera's shooting that the department posted to YouTube on Thursday, a 911 caller tells a dispatcher in Spanish that a man with a gun is pointing it at people along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The dispatcher asks the man if it is a small gun, and he then says he doesn't know exactly what the man is holding. The call went out over the police radio as a man pointing an ""unknown type handgun at passersby."" Later, as responding officers Tatiana Bohorquez and Manuel Rios are driving toward the scene, another officer can be heard on the radio stating, ""He does have a handgun, and he's firing at a house right now."" ""Oh, s—,"" Bohorquez, who is driving, can be heard saying. Rios, in the passenger seat, then opens the passenger side door of the patrol vehicle as it is still moving and holds his handgun at the ready in his right hand. ""You might have to shoot. You might have to shoot,"" Bohorquez says as they pull up near Barrera. Rios then immediately opens fire, seeming to fire four rounds down the street at Barrera. Timestamps on the body-worn video the department posted showed that the officers then waited about 10 minutes to begin approaching Barrera with a group of other officers. Barrera was handcuffed and taken to a local hospital for treatment. Despite the fact that Barrera did not have a gun or any other weapon on him, the LAPD presented a case for assault with a deadly weapon against him to the L.A. County district attorney's office, which prosecutors rejected. Barrera could not be reached for comment Friday. The district attorney's office did not respond to a request for comment. Capt. Kelly Muniz, an LAPD spokeswoman, said the department could not immediately answer questions about the incident or the officers' actions prior to the completion of an internal investigation of the shooting. LAPD Chief Michel Moore said areas of concern that arise from such shootings are addressed immediately with involved officers through preliminary briefings and trainings, but to reach public conclusions about officers' actions before the completion of the related investigation ""would be contrary to our commitment to basing conclusions after reviewing all of the information provided."" Barrera's shooting follows others in recent months in which LAPD officers opened fire on suspects whom callers had reported were armed with firearms, but were not. Two days before Christmas, LAPD officers entered a Burlington store in North Hollywood where at least one 911 caller claimed that a man with a gun was threatening people and had opened fire. ""So he shot the gun?"" the dispatcher said. ""Yes,"" the caller said. When officers found the suspect, 24-year-old Daniel Elena-Lopez, assaulting a woman, a lead officer with a rifle immediately shot him. Elena-Lopez, who had a heavy bike lock but no gun, was killed, as was 14-year-old Valentina Orellana-Peralta, who was hiding in a changing room with her mother and was struck by one of the officer's rifle rounds that pierced a wall. In another high-profile incident in July, a 911 caller reported a man on Hollywood Boulevard was ""screaming and harassing people"" with ""what looks to be a pistol in his hand."" When officers ran up to the suspect, Matthew James Sova, in front of a McDonald's near the busy tourist intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue and he raised his hand in their direction, they immediately shot him. Sova did not have a gun, but a butane lighter with a pistol-like grip. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. LAPD officials have recently lamented a recent rise in the number of police shootings, especially of individuals who are not armed with firearms, and have said they are revisiting training — including in the use of less-lethal weapons like projectiles and Tasers as alternatives to deadly force.

4/30/2022,"(Reuters) - Lifting sanctions imposed on Russia is part of peace negotiations between Moscow and Ukraine, which are ""difficult"" but continue daily, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in remarks published early on Saturday. Kyiv warned on Friday that talks on ending Russia's invasion, now in its third month, were in danger of collapse. ""At present, the Russian and Ukrainian delegations are actually discussing on a daily basis via video-conferencing a draft of a possible treaty,"" Lavrov said in comments to China's official Xinhua news agency published on the Russian foreign ministry's website. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has insisted since the invasion began on Feb. 24 that Western sanctions on Russia needed to be strengthened and could not be part of negotiations. Ukraine and Russia have not held face-to-face peace talks since March 29, and the atmosphere has soured over Ukrainian allegations that Russian troops carried out atrocities as they withdrew from areas near Kyiv. Moscow has denied the claims. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression. ""The talks' agenda also includes, among others, the issues of denazificiation, the recognition of new geopolitical realities, the lifting of sanctions, the status of the Russian language,"" Lavrov said, without elaborating. ""We are in favour of continuing the negotiations, although they are difficult,"" Lavrov said. Ukraine's Western allies have placed sweeping sanctions on Moscow. They have frozen around half of Russia's state gold and foreign currency reserves, hammering Russia's economy and putting it on the brink of sovereign default.
