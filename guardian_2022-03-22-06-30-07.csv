3/22/2022,"Sebastian Coe has claimed that the “integrity and future of women’s sport” is at stake after the American swimmer Lia Thomas became the first transgender woman to win an NCAA swimming championship last week. The World Athletics president also called on the International Olympic Committee to introduce regulations that can be applied across every sport and insisted that “gender cannot trump biology”. Thomas, who swam for the University of Pennsylvania men’s team for three seasons before starting hormone replacement therapy in 2019, made history by winning the 500-yard freestyle in Atlanta but has faced protests since starting to compete as a woman. Asked how important the challenge of transgender women is in athletics, Lord Coe said: “I think that the integrity of women’s sport – if we don’t get this right – and actually the future of women’s sport, is very fragile.” Under Coe’s watch, World Athletics has introduced strict rules for transgender athletes that mean they must keep their testosterone levels under a certain limit for at least 12 months before being allowed to compete internationally. Athletes with DSD (difference of sexual development) such as South Africa’s Caster Semenya have also been forced to restrict their testosterone levels for six months to be permitted to compete internationally over certain distances. “There is no question to me that testosterone is the key determinant in performance,” Coe told the Daily Telegraph. “If you look at the nature of 12– or 13-year-old girls, I remember my daughters would regularly outrun male counterparts in their class, but as soon as puberty kicks in that gap opens and it remains. He added: “Gender cannot trump biology. As a federation president, I do not have that luxury. It is a luxury that other organisations not at the practical end of having to deal with these issues have. But As far as I am concerned, the scientific evidence, the peer-reviewed work we have done, those regulations are the right approach.” Asked how he might feel when athletics encounters its first transgender woman winning races like Thomas, he added: “You can’t be oblivious to public sentiment, of course not. But science is important. If I wasn’t satisfied with the science that we have and the experts that have been working on this for a long time, this would be a very different landscape. It is not something you can keep farming off onto the member federations.”",Sport/Sport,Coe warns transgender athletes pose risk to integrity of women’s sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/coe-warns-transgender-athletes-pose-risk-to-integrity-of-womens-sport
3/22/2022,"The woman with whom Ben Roberts-Smith was having an affair - and who is at the centre of an allegation of domestic violence against him - is expected to give evidence in his defamation trial Tuesday afternoon. The trial has spent weeks focused on Australian SAS missions in Afghanistan, with a series of former comrades giving evidence about actions on operation, but it will shift its focus to Australia as the woman, anonymised in court documents as Person 17, to enter the witness box. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 17 and Roberts-Smith had a relationship in 2017 and 2018 while both were married to other people. Text messages between the pair - tendered as court documents - show a relationship riven by mistrust and confrontations. The newspapers allege Roberts-Smith was violent towards Person 17 on one occasion, punching her in the face following a function at Parliament House in March 2018, allegedly because he was worried her behaviour had revealed their affair. Roberts-Smith, in his evidence last year, said the claim was “completely false” and “a fabrication”, and that Person 17 had injured herself when she drunkenly fell down the stairs. He said he treated her injuries and stayed up all night monitoring her condition. The court heard that after the relationship broke down in the days after the function, Person 17 arrived unannounced at the Roberts-Smith’s family home in Queensland, and confronted his then wife, Emma. Emma Roberts, in her evidence to this trial, said Person 17 had a black eye on that day, which she said had been caused by a drunken fall. But when Roberts’s mother, also present, asked “‘are you saying that Ben did that to you?’… [Person 17] didn’t answer”. The court has also heard when Person 17 told Roberts-Smith she was pregnant with his child, he did not believe her, and paid a former policeman-turned private eye to follow her to a Brisbane termination clinic and film her. Roberts-Smith later confronted her, and Person 17 told her she’d lost the pregnancy earlier. On Monday, a former comrade of Roberts-Smith, a still-serving member of the SAS known before the court as Person 7, spent his fourth days in the witness box detailing his service alongside, and relationship with, the Victoria Cross winner. Under cross-examination, the soldier denied that telling journalists about war crimes allegations was an attempt to “tarnish” the reputation of decorated veteran Ben Roberts-Smith, saying he only wanted the allegations he’d been told by other soldiers to be “taken seriously”. Person 7, subpoenaed to give evidence for the newspapers, denied he was waging a vendetta against Roberts-Smith, motivated by jealously, but said he felt obliged to speak out when confronted by “egregious” allegations. Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, put it to Person 7 that his motivation in speaking to journalists was to “tarnish” the Victoria Cross winner’s public reputation. “No I don’t accept that ... I wanted Australia to take these allegations seriously,” he told the court. “I am a senior [non-commissioned officer] in the army, I was told of an allegation of an egregious nature, I am not walking past that,” Person 7 said in earlier evidence. Person 7 fought alongside Roberts-Smith at the 2010 Battle of Tizak, for which Roberts-Smith won Australia’s highest military honour, the Victoria Cross. Person 7’s cross-examination spent several hours focused on his attitude towards Roberts-Smith’s medal. Person 7 said he believed Roberts-Smith’s formal citation, which details him storming insurgent machine-gun posts “with a total disregard for his own safety”, contained “lies and embellishments” which exaggerated Roberts-Smith’s actions at the expense of some of his comrades. There was forensic focus in court on the wording of the citation: whether an insurgent killed in the firefight was armed; on the intensity of the gunfire during the 13-hour battle; around a grenade thrown by Roberts-Smith which did not detonate; and whether an enemy position captured by Roberts-Smith was fortified and elevated. Moses suggested to Person 7 that he had “just not let go” of Roberts-Smith being awarded the VC for his actions at Tizak. “I let this go a long time ago,” the witness replied. “I got on with my life.” Person 7 remains in the witness box. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial: woman who war veteran had affair with to give evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/ben-roberts-smith-defamation-trial-woman-who-war-veteran-had-affair-with-to-give-evidence
3/22/2022,"History was made Monday, as the first Black woman ever nominated to the US supreme court testified to the Senate judiciary committee. But before Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson could speak at her confirmation hearing, she first had to listen to a lot of white men. The Senate confirmation hearings for Jackson started Monday, giving the judge and every member of the judiciary committee the opportunity to deliver remarks about her nomination. In her opening statement, Jackson took the opportunity to thank her parents, husband and two daughters, all of whom sat behind her in the hearing room as she delivered her remarks. Jackson recounted how her parents, two former public school teachers, had to endure lawful segregation in the years before her birth in 1970. “My parents taught me that unlike the many barriers that they had had to face growing up, my path was clearer,” Jackson said. “So that if I worked hard and I believed in myself in America, I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be.” Jackson delivered her moving opening statement about four and a half hours after the hearing began. All 22 members of the judiciary committee spoke before Jackson, alternating between praising her resume and raising questions about her past rulings. Jackson sat quietly for the first few hours of the hearing, occasionally smiling or taking notes about cases mentioned by the senators on the panel. “You’re obviously a good listener because you’re doing a lot of listening here today,” Democrat Richard Blumenthal told Jackson. Blumenthal joined other Democrats in praising Joe Biden’s nomination of Jackson, describing her selection as an “inflection pinnacle for our nation”. “The appointment of a black woman to the United States supreme court, let’s be very blunt, should have happened years ago,” Blumenthal said. “This day is a giant leap into the present for our country and for the court.” Many of the senators on the judiciary committee seemed to have an eye toward the history books as they addressed Jackson. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the panel, opened the hearing by noting that there were nearly 700,000 enslaved people living in the US when the supreme court first met in 1790. At the time, neither African Americans nor women had the right to vote. “There was no equal justice under the law for a majority of people living in America,” Durbin said. In the more than 230 years since that first meeting, 108 of the 115 justices who have served on the court have been white men, Durbin pointed out. “Your presence here today, your willingness to brave this process, will give inspiration to millions of Americans who see themselves in you,” Durbin told Jackson. As Democrats celebrated Jackson’s nomination, Republicans went out of their way to argue that their reservations about the judge have nothing to do with her race or gender but rather her judicial record. “I have said in the past that I think it’s good for the court to look like America. So count me in on the idea of making the court more diverse,” Republican Lindsey Graham said. Graham attacked Democrats for trying to paint Republicans as racist, insisting he and his colleagues would not be scared out of asking Jackson tough questions. “We’re going to ask you what we think you need to be asked,” Graham said. Even as senators focused on the historic nature of Jackson’s nomination, the hearing underscored how much progress still needs to be made to build a more representative government in America. White men make up about two-thirds of the Senate judiciary committee, and only one woman of color – Democrat Mazie Hirono of Hawaii – sits on the panel. “For over 233 years, the individuals making decisions that have altered the course of this country have almost exclusively been white men,” Hirono said at the hearing. Hirono criticized Republicans who have belittled Jackson’s selection as the result of affirmative action because of Biden’s campaign promise to nominate a Black woman to the supreme court. “Let me be clear, your nomination is not about filling a quota; it is about time. It’s about time that we have a highly qualified, highly accomplished Black woman on the supreme court,” Hirono said. “It’s about time our highest court better reflects the country it serves.” After listening to hours of remarks from senators about her barrier-breaking nomination, Jackson instead reflected on those who came before her to make her prestigious career possible. She specifically expressed gratitude for Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights activist who became the first Black woman to serve as a US federal judge. “Like Judge Motley, I have dedicated my career to ensuring that the words engraved on the front of the supreme court building – equal justice under law – are a reality and not just an ideal,” Jackson said. “Thank you for this historic chance to join the highest court, to work with brilliant colleagues, to inspire future generations and to ensure liberty and justice for all.”",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson speaks of ‘historic chance’ after hours of senators’ remarks,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/21/ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmation-hearing-historic-chance
3/22/2022,"The Treasury has drawn up a range of options to help with the cost of living crisis – including a 1p cut to income tax, raising the national insurance threshold and a significant cut to fuel duty. But government sources said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, was still reluctant to make big fiscal changes. Sunak is under huge pressure from Conservative MPs to help households struggling with high petrol prices and inflation when he delivers the spring statements on Wednesday. Options considered by the Treasury include a promised 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax, potentially coming in at the autumn budget or next year, which would largely offset the rise in national insurance. Sunak could also set out a pathway to raising the national insurance threshold to the same rate as income tax, from £9,600 to £12,750 – a Tory manifesto promise. He has also been considering a cut in fuel duty, with Labour backing a reduction of up to 5p in response to soaring fuel prices and a concerted campaign from some Tory MPs. Labour has also been calling for a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies profiting from high global oil and gas prices, which Sunak has resisted so far. However, some Tory backbenchers think there is still some scope for him to U-turn on this, given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has changed the economic picture and caused a spike in prices. On Friday, Sunak dropped a heavy hint that he will try to help with the cost of living but also stressed that there were some things the government cannot change and highlighted “global inflationary forces”. One Treasury source said an income tax cut was still the source of “internal negotiation” but confirmed it was under discussion. Sunak said on Friday that tax rises were “done” and signalled he wanted to cut taxes before the next election. But another official said Sunak was still resisting significant interventions or commitments for the autumn. “He’s literally been ‘auto-no’ to anything suggested,” the source said. A cut in fuel duty would be enthusiastically welcomed by many backbench Conservatives, but some campaigners are warning against it. Analysis by the New Economics Foundation (Nef) shows just 7% of the benefit goes to the poorest fifth of households. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has piled added pressure on Sunak to ease the cost of living in Britain. The Bank of England has said inflation could hit 10% later this year and it is unable to prevent rising energy prices from making people poorer, leaving it up to the chancellor to act. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility is likely to provide Sunak with the scope to act when it produces new forecasts for the public finances on Wednesday. Lower than expected unemployment means the OBR will reduce its estimate of the long-term damage from the pandemic, while higher inflation has increased the amount of money Sunak will get from freezing tax allowances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week the Treasury had been expecting to get £8bn a year from the move but would actually receive £20.5bn.",News/Politics,Treasury considers ways to ease cost of living in spring statement,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/21/treasury-considers-ways-to-ease-cost-of-living-in-spring-statement

3/22/2022,"A “cold, unempathetic, manipulative” student who raped and sexually attacked two women while he was on bail and being investigated for an earlier violent rape has been jailed for 17 years. Charles Goodwin, 21, attacked his victims after getting them drunk, Liverpool crown court heard. He met his first victim, 22, in a Manchester nightclub, describing himself as a boxer. Back at the woman’s Manchester flat he raped her three times in a “sustained attack” in which he slapped her and grabbed her throat. Sentencing Goodwin on Monday, judge Garrett Byrne said: “A shocking aspect of this case is that after you were arrested for those matters you were released, initially on bail, then released under investigation and you went on to rape [the second victim] and sexually assault [the third victim] twice. “The fact you were under investigation for the first set of offences did nothing to inhibit you or cause you to stop, in fact the reverse is true.” The judge said part of Goodwin‘s modus operandi was to get his victims drunk to take advantage of their vulnerability. The second and third victims were attacked within days of each other in their student accommodation in Liverpool. The judge added: “What was clear from all the evidence given by victims is that you had no care whatsoever as to whether or not they were consenting, their consent was a matter of complete indifference to you. “You treated each of them not as a human being, deserving respect, but as a plaything or toy. You took the view once they were within your control you could do to them as you pleased.” Matthew Curtis, prosecuting, read statements from the women, one of whom said she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the attack. She said: “I now feel any control I did have can be stripped away from me by the whim of a man who just wants to get what he wants.” Another victim said she had lost trust in people and avoided situations where she would be drinking with men. “I am genuinely scared of drunk boys,” she said. The judge said he was satisfied Goodwin was dangerous and ordered an extended licence period of three years on top of his sentence. “I saw you give evidence. You struck me as a highly intelligent, cold, unempathetic and manipulative person who knew perfectly well what you were doing was wrong.” Katy Appleton, defending, said Goodwin had a difficult relationship with his mother, which had shaped his negative views towards women. “Goodwin acknowledges some flaws in his behaviour, namely his arrogance and his attitude towards women.” Goodwin, a business management student from Liverpool, was found guilty of four counts of rape, one count of assault by penetration, one count of attempting to choke, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of sexual assault.",News/UK news,Rapist jailed for 17 years after attacking again while on bail,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/rapist-jailed-for-17-years-after-attacking-again-while-on-bail
