4/14/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — State media anchor Ri Chun Hi is one of North Korea’s most famous voices after announcing the country's major events of past decades — among them nuclear and missile tests and the death of a leader — in a resounding, booming voice filled with emotion. The anchor dubbed abroad as the “pink lady” for her bright, traditional attire was the topic of official North Korean media herself Thursday after leader Kim Jong Un gave Ri a luxurious residence and asked her to continue to vigorously serve as the voice of his ruling Workers’ Party. Experts say Kim is trying to boost his support from elite North Koreas while the country deals with pandemic hardships and a diplomacy stalemate. “(Kim) said it is the sincerity of the party that there is nothing to spare for the treasures of the country like her who has worked as a revolutionary announcer for the party for more than 50 years since her girlhood,” the official Korean Central News Agency said. Kim expressed “expectation that she would as ever vigorously continue her work in good health as befitting a spokeswoman for the party.” Kim met Ri at a newly built riverside terraced residential district that was inaugurated Wednesday in Pyongyang. KCNA said houses in the district were presented to Ri and other people who have given distinguished service to the state. Friday is the 110th birthday of Kim’s late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung. It’s the most important state anniversary in North Korea, which has been successively ruled by three generations of the Kim family since its foundation in 1948. The new housing area is where Kim Il Sung’s official residence was located until the 1970s. “By giving houses to those who have been faithful to him, Kim Jong Un would want to further bolster their royalty and internal unity,” said Moon Seong Mook, an analyst with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy. “Ri Chun Hi is a clear example of such people as she’s strongly propagated his nuclear and missile tests and served as a sort of bugler for him.” KCNA said Kim looked around Ri’s house with her Wednesday and took an unspecified step to prevent her from suffering any inconvenience ""while going up and down the stairs."" Ri, who is about 79, said she felt her new house was like a hotel and that all her family members “stayed up all night in tears of deep gratitude for the party’s benevolence,” according to KCNA. Ri joined state TV in the early 1970s, when the country was still governed by Kim Il Sung, and she has gradually become the face of the country’s propaganda-driven news broadcasts. Her close ties with Kim were shown during a military parade last year when she watched troops’ march from an elevated veranda right next to Kim, put her hand on his shoulder and whispered to him at one point. In another event, she was the first person who exchanged a handshake with Kim before holding his arm and posing for a group photo. Moon, the analyst, said Ri receives Cabinet member-level treatment at home, appears healthy and is expected to continue to handle key televised announcements at least for the next few years. Ri's passionate, effusive style has sometimes generated laughter in other countries. In 2011, a Taiwanese TV station apologized after one of its newsreaders mimicked Ri’s tone used when she announced the death of Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il. Since inheriting power upon his father's death, Kim Jong Un, 38, has ruled North Korea with absolute authority. But he is facing one of the toughest moments of his rule after the coronavirus pandemic shocked an economy already in dire shape from mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions. Analysts say recent missile tests were meant to advance his weapons and pressure the U.S. and rivals for diplomatic concessions.",World/Associated Press,Kim gives North Korea's most famous newscaster a luxury home,https://news.yahoo.com/kim-gives-north-koreas-most-080406035.html
4/14/2022,"NEW YORK — A trillion dollars: That’s how much money famed investor Bill Browder believes Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs have stolen from the Russian people since the fall of the Soviet Union. “And that was money that was supposed to be spent on health care and education, roads and services,” Browder said at a Manhattan event to celebrate the publication of his second book, “Freezing Order,” which chronicles how he became a Putin nemesis as a result of his attempts to expose Kremlin corruption. Those efforts led to the death of Browder’s attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who was tortured in a Russian prison and whose name is affixed to sanctions bills passed by Congress. Learning of Magnitsky’s death was “the most heartbreaking, traumatic, and devastating moment of my life,” Browder writes — and a sign of how committed Putin was willing to pursuing perceived enemies of the state. The grandson of American communist leader Earl Browder, Bill Browder had made billions through Hermitage Capital Management, the fund he started in 1996, during the chaotic period of full-contact Russian capitalism. As Browder heightened scrutiny of some of the companies he invested in — most notably, energy giant Gazprom — he ran afoul of a Kremlin that, under Putin, has declared such questions off limits, as they would go to the very heart of the kleptocracy that had ruled Russia since the nation’s industry was sold off and plundered in the early 1990s. “Everyone tries to think about Russia as a sovereign state and Putin as a leader acting in national interest,” Browder said to Yahoo News, describing that outlook as a fundamental misunderstanding. “You think you can apply political science to Russia. You need to apply criminal science. You need to be a criminologist to understand Russia. People don’t go into government to serve the country. They go into government to steal money.” Browder was banned from entering Russia in 2005 and has since watched a series of American presidents try to improve relations with the Kremlin. He now lives in London, a city favored by the oligarchs he despises. “We basically said, ‘It's OK. We want your money. We want your oil,’” Browder told Yahoo News in an interview at the Century Club ahead of Tuesday’s book release party. Today it is uncontroversial to call Putin a war criminal. But the man bombing Kharkiv is the same one who leveled the Chechen capital, Grozny, in 2000, invaded Georgia in 2008 and seized Ukrainian territory for the first time in 2014. “When I walked into the offices of government ministers in Europe, or the United States, back in the early days talking about sanctioning Russia — it’s like I walked in with a giant turd on my head,” Browder said. Today, Browder is known less as an investor than as a human rights campaigner and Putin critic. Tuesday’s party thus included an eclectic mix: the professional basketball player Enes Kanter Freedom, former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara, private equity giant Stephen Schwarzman and National Review journalist Jay Nordlinger, who in 2017 highlighted the refusal of federal authorities to allow Browder into the U.S. The decision was reversed. Browder is especially withering when it comes to the Western attorneys, bankers and publicists who help Putin’s oligarchs hide their ill-gotten gains, sue investigative journalists into submission and burnish their blood-spattered records with favorable coverage. There could be only one motive for Western firms to do business with the Kremlin, Browder believes. “They’re just a bunch of greedy bastards that are trying to make as much money as possible,” he said, alluding to the legal travails of British journalist Catherine Belton, who was sued for reporting on Kremlin corruption. “They don’t care who they’re working for.” Last week, Browder testified in Washington during a hearing on the Enablers Act, which would tighten already existing rules around money laundering, in effect providing more government scrutiny into the secretive movement of funds from countries like China and Russia. “If we make banks report dirty money but allow law, real estate and accounting firms to look the other way, that creates a loophole that crooks and kleptocrats can sail a yacht through,” Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., said last fall when introducing the legislation. While it targets any institution or individual abetting money laundering, the measure has assumed a new urgency since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Browder has additionally called for foreign accomplices of Russia to be deprived of entry into the United States, a proposal clearly aimed at Kremlin allies residing in the British capital, which has earned the unflattering nickname “Londongrad.” He bemoans the notion that high-profile seizures of oligarchs’ yachts give the impression of fatal blows, when they are really just minor difficulties or men worth billions. “The real money is held in highly complex trusts and structures,” Browder said, in offshore havens like Jersey and the Cayman Islands. Sanctions are one way to fight Putin. Weapons are another. “The Ukrainians say they need a no fly-zone,” he pointed out, rejecting the idea that such a move would immediately lead to nuclear war. “At what point,” he wondered, “do you finally stand up to Russia?” And much as he would like to see Putin defeated, he hopes to return to Russia one day when it is a free country, one that doesn’t threaten him with prison or murder. “It’s fascinating. It’s interesting. It’s unforgettable. It’s horrible,” Browder told Yahoo News. “It’s nasty, brutish. It’s got everything. If Putin wasn’t in power, and there was a democratic government, I would love to go back there.”",World/Yahoo News,Putin nemesis Bill Browder reveals the 'real money' funding Kremlin's war,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-nemesis-bill-browder-reveals-the-real-money-funding-kremlins-war-090014724.html
4/14/2022,"Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova died in Ukraine on March 14 at the age of 24. She and her Fox News colleagues were attacked while reporting in the suburbs of Kyiv, a combat zone. Kuvshynova's father told Insider he did not understand why they took on such a dangerous trip. The Ukrainian news producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova — Sasha to all who knew her — always surprised her parents with her quiet independence. In February 2014, she disappeared from home in Kyiv as it was gripped by the Euromaidan revolution which ousted the government and changed Ukraine forever. It almost got her killed, her father, Andrey Kuvshinov told Insider. ""Twenty-four hours later, we found out that our daughter — who was still a schoolgirl at the time — was at the media center, helping with her friend to translate texts,"" he told Insider. The building, the Trade Union Hall in central Kyiv, burned to the ground a few hours after she got home, and 22 people died. Eight years later, Russia invaded Ukraine and Sasha again found herself helping tell the world, this time as a field producer working with Fox News. On March 14, 2022, Sasha drove out of Kyiv on an assignment with two Fox veterans: reporter Benjamin Hall and cameraman Pierre Zarkrzewski. She'd been contracted with Fox for around two months. Their destination was Irpin, a town northwest of Kyiv that had come under attack in recent days, according to a Telegram post by Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser in the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Sources citing people close to the situation told Insider that the Fox team was not accompanied by security personnel the whole way, and that they were dropped off at an earlier stage. A Fox News spokesperson told Insider: ""Our security team knew exactly where they were. We knew where we dropped them off, where they were going, and where they ended up."" Near Horenka — a village that had been under heavy attack by Russia — an explosion hit their car. It killed everyone but Hall, who was badly hurt, losing one leg, his other foot and sight in one eye. Little more is publicly known. In the weeks since she died, Insider spoke with Sasha's father, several of her friends, Fox News, and journalists in Kyiv doing similar work to find out more about what happened that day, the risks local producers face, and what kind of person Sasha was. Sviatoslav Yurash, a Ukrainian MP told Insider that the Fox News trip was likely an ""embed,"" where the military takes journalists with them to cover events. Fox News declined to provide further details of the trip, citing the security of its staff still in Ukraine. Military officials and authorities in Kyiv also declined to comment. Yurash, who was a friend and former boyfriend of Sasha, told Insider he had seen video of the aftermath of the attack, taken by soldiers who found and rescued Hall. He said they were struck around the Kyiv city limit, where it meets the wider Kyiv administrative region. ""The car is utterly destroyed,"" said Yurash, describing the video. ""You can see that this was either a direct hit, or something of this sort."" Gerashchenko, the Ukrainian official, said in his post the car had been hit by a mortar shell or artillery fire from Russian forces. It is unclear if the car was a military vehicle, a civilian one, or if it was marked as being used by journalists. Andrey Kuvshinov, Sasha's father, told Insider that Sasha always wore her ""press"" clothing. By international law, journalists are not legitimate military targets. Intentional killing of civilians — a category that includes journalists — is a war crime. The attack prompted questions about why the Fox team took their reporting trip. Andrey Kuvshinov told Insider: ""I don't understand how a decision was taken for Fox News to go where it was dangerous, where there was a live threat."" ""It was so scary round there. Why did they end up there? ""They were not ready for evacuation, they didn't know what to do. They took ages to find each other. So how could the managers be so irresponsible and send people who were not prepared at all to the military zone?"" For Andrey, the news is still difficult to take in. ""All I know is hearsay,"" he said. ""So I'm still hoping she's alive."" A Fox News spokesperson declined to respond directly to Kuvshinov's questions, or describe the story that the team was pursuing. Alfred Hackensberger, a reporter for Die Welt who was also based in Kyiv at the time, told Insider the decision to go in the direction of Horenka was unwise. (Die Welt shares a parent company, Axel Springer, with Insider.) ""From my point of view, there was no journalistic reason to go there, because everything is already documented,"" he said. Visits to Horenka were possible even the day before, when The New York Times reported from the area. But even before then journalists were being killed and injured all over Ukraine. Dominique van Heerden is a Sky News producer who narrowly escaped an ambush near Kyiv with her colleagues. She told Insider that a previously safe area can become dangerous in moments. She noted that she and colleagues were attacked after turning back from their destination, down a road they took earlier that day without incident. She emphasized she had no specific knowledge of the attack that killed Sasha, and wasn't in a position to judge any decisions taken. Risk-taking is often celebrated up to the point that somebody is hurt, she noted. ""Sometimes, when you push a story a bit too far and you get a great story, you're 'brave,' and you're 'amazing,' and you're shining lights. ""And when you maybe push a bit far, and you don't get a story, and something goes wrong, then you are stupid. So it's a no-win situation."" The attack also reignited a discussion of how Western outlets work with local reporters, Margo Gontar, a journalist and a friend of Sasha's, told Insider. Sasha's role is generally referred to in the industry as a ""fixer,"" people who can provide local knowledge, translation, practical help, and arrange access that would otherwise be unavailable to foreign reporters abruptly arriving in a war zone. Fixers for Western media rarely get equal credit, as The Washington Post reported, despite facing equal danger. That hierarchy appeared to play out when Sasha died, as Fox first announced the critical injuries to Hall, then the death of Zakrzewski, and only hours later that Sasha was also killed. Several journalists accused Fox of appearing to give Sasha secondary importance to its US-based employees. But Trey Yingst, a Fox News correspondent also in Ukraine, said the network had held back out of respect for her family. —Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) March 16, 2022 Yurash, the Ukrainian MP, confirmed this to Insider. ""The family was in a state of disbelief about what happened,"" he said. ""As soon as there was acceptance from the parents, there was a statement about Oleksandra."" Van Heerden said that fixers are often ""really established and kind of amazing journalists in their own right."" But where they differ from the international reporters is that they are doing all this while their own country — their own lives — are being turned upside down, she said. International reporters usually get to go home. But for someone like Sasha, ""this is not a story that they can leave,"" she said. ""This is their home."" To those who knew her, the attack robbed the world of a talented and determined woman who dreamed of more than reporting the destruction of her homeland. She loved poetry, cinema, photography, and electronic music — which she shared by organizing the KRAЙ festival in Kyiv, and jam sessions in the city. Like other creatives, she gravitated naturally towards the hipster neighborhood of Podil, where Gontar recalled sharing drinks and jokes with her. One of her best friends, filmmaker Edwin Novak, said she was destined to push boundaries in documentary filmmaking. The opportunity to work with Fox was a big break towards that, he told Insider. ""She wasn't just someone who just did a few projects and was kind of artsy and creative and all the rest, but she had a real ability to look further,"" he said. Fox News senior field producer Yonat Friling, who worked with Sasha during the invasion, said in a tribute published by the network that her journalistic instincts were indispensable to the network's reporting on the war. She was funny and creative, with ""a dark sense of humor,"" Friling said. Novak told Insider that beneath that humor was the sort of wisdom of someone who'd lived several lifetimes. He said: ""She felt the pain of this world. She had an extraordinary capacity to understand it."" Yurash, the MP who was Sasha's friend and on-off boyfriend, mourned her as ""the beauty of Kyiv."" —Sviatoslav Yurash (@SviatoslavUA) March 16, 2022 Although she never really sought to be a leader, people often made her one, said her father Andrey. When the war broke out, Sasha also started a volunteer initiative, UA.Life.Delivery, which brings munitions to the army and medical supplies and food to vulnerable people. The work helped ""dozens of people,"" said Kristina Parashchyevina, an architect who continues to co-organize the project, in a statement to Insider. Sasha's work ethic could be so fierce ""she did not allow herself to rest for two to three days in a row sometimes,"" said Novak. A day or so before the war broke out, Sasha was drinking wine with Aleksey Horbach, a media producer. She planned to go to Donetsk, correctly anticipating that Russia would attack there first. ""But it turned out the whole of Ukraine became a front line,"" Horbach wrote. ""So she stayed in Kyiv to highlight the war."" Friends tried to persuade her not to do such perilous work. But several told Insider that she understood the risks. ""I asked her if she really wants to work as a war journalist, because it is very dangerous,"" Horbach said. ""She replied with: 'Sure, because I am doing what I truly like,'"" he said. ""For this she gave her life."" Novak, the close friend, forwarded Insider a WhatsApp video Sasha sent to some friends in the days before she was killed, discussing the risks she was taking. ""The first time I was in those places, I was scared,"" said Sasha, describing trips to areas near Kyiv under attack. ""And today I went, just like that, looking around. They are shooting everywhere, something is on fire, something is flying, and I'm like: Okay. ""Maybe it's the nice weather, I don't know. But I'm already used to it, I no longer have fear [...] I stare at it with cold eyes. It will be as it will be. ""If it falls, it falls — sure, it will be unpleasant, it will suck, I might die. But ... it's like that."" Read the original article on Business Insider",World/Business Insider,"A bright, talented Ukrainian journalist signed up to help Fox News cover the war.
