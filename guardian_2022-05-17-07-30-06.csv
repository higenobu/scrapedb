5/17/2022,"The families of two young men with disabilities who were abused by a carer have told an inquiry they never received a formal apology or compensation from the provider. The disability royal commission on Monday began a five-day examination of the programs offered by Afford, a large national disability insurance scheme provider with several services in New South Wales, as well as other states. The inquiry is looking at the experiences of three men with disability – known to the commission as Jason, Simon and Toby* – at a day program run by Afford in western Sydney. It heard two of the men, 24-year-old Jason, who is autistic and has an intellectual disability, and Toby, 22, were among a number of men abused by a lifestyle support worker employed by Afford. After police found images of clients taken during their personal care on the carer’s mobile phone, he was charged with offences connected to the abuse, pleaded guilty and was jailed for three years, the inquiry heard. Under questioning by counsel assisting Ben Fogarty, Jason’s mother, Sally*, said she had received an initial phone call from Afford but no formal apology or compensation. She said no funds they had spent on services were returned to them. “I felt, the day he was arrested, for Afford, [it was] ‘wash my hands of him, he’s been arrested, that’s it, we don’t need to deal with anything else’,” Sally told the hearing. Sally said the family first learned of the abuse from the police, before getting a call from the chief executive from Afford the following day. She said the chief executive apologised during the phone call and then insisted he had “stayed back late” and checked the paperwork to ensure the offending carer had been employed “properly”. “And that really stuck in my mind because I’m thinking, at this stage, I’ve just found out that my child’s been abused at the hand of one of your workers and it’s more important for you to tell me that you’ve employed him properly,” Sally said. “I was in shock … after I got off the phone I remember saying, ‘I don’t understand that phone call at all’.” Aside from taking intimate images of clients over 2019 and 2020, the carer also taunted and hit the clients. Suzie*, the mother of Toby, who lives with Down syndrome, said their family had also not received a written apology or compensation. Nor had their payments been refunded. The inquiry heard that after the carer was arrested Suzie received a short phone call in which the chief executive apologised, though she described it as “pretty perfunctory”. Suzie and Toby’s fatherwere horrified when they learned of the abuse and developed a deep mistrust of people caring for their son, the inquiry heard. Simon*, 26, received care on at least one occasion from the Afford worker. By the time man was charged, Simon was no longer receiving care from Afford. Simon’s mother Lilly* told the inquiry that Afford never informed her that the carer had been charged and she learned about it when another parent shared a news story about the case on Facebook. Lilly said Afford staff had declined to discuss the matter with her, citing privacy and confidentiality. There was no evidence Simon had been abused, but Lilly said: “It was a bit devastating and it’s always in the back of your mind – did anything happen to my child?” The inquiry heard the parents of the three men had complained about the quality of care and invoices that had been issued. Suzie withdrew Toby after the family was sent an invoice for services that did not occur because he was on holiday with his family in New Zealand. The inquiry heard that Afford had grown significantly since the rollout of the national NDIS. According to its annual report, in 2020/2021 it supported more than 6,000 clients with disability and had a yearly revenue of $145.6m after growing from only 898 clients in 2016-17. Afford will give evidence later in the week along with the NDIS watchdog. The inquiry continues. * Names throughout are pseudonyms provided by the royal commission",News/Australia news,"Young men abused by carer in Sydney never got compensation or written apology, disability inquiry told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/young-men-abused-by-carer-in-sydney-never-got-compensation-or-written-apology-disability-inquiry-told
5/17/2022,"After a season of gentle optimism, global improvement and reasons to believe, it felt as if it was all going to come down to this. The question was if Mikel Arteta’s best José Mourinho impression after the North London derby, ostentatiously avoiding explicit comment and covering for his Arsenal players by making himself the story, was to have the desired effect. In a season of the Spaniard’s team providing half-answers to many, they did it again at St James’ Park. They had the guts but they lacked the nerve required of them on a Monday night that was always going to be more challenging than some suggested. Tottenham’s follow-up win, laboriously prised from Burnley at Sunday lunchtime, had knocked the ball flush into their court. The schedule and the occasion demanded and, if ever there was a night for Arsenal to show they really had changed and were becoming a team of substance, then this was it. If they were looking for an idyllic retreat to recover from Thursday’s ordeal, though, this was never going to be it. This was not quite the bear pit they had faced (and which had initially inspired them) in N19 last week but it was not a million miles away from it as the game kicked off, in an arena brought back to its buoyant best since the late autumn exit of Mike Ashley – with a crowd ready to hail its Newcastle United side’s sharp revival in 2022 ahead of a summer full of unfamiliar optimism. The home fans chanted with insistence and the visitors could have done with some of their certainty. The suspicion was Aaron Ramsdale’s heartily-cheered slip in the opening seconds, when making his inaugural clearance of the evening, pointed the way to forthcoming mishap and Arsenal began nervily. The inclusion of Ben White and Gabriel in defence had increased pre-match optimism that they arrived in the north with poise and fortitude, even if there was a suspicion that Arteta was taking a justifiable gamble on their fitness. The creaking joints of the back four, it turned out, were elsewhere. In the early stages Takehiro Tomiyasu peered warily over his shoulder at the lurking Allan Saint-Maximin and, if he was gazing in the right direction, it was perhaps at the wrong man, as the home side exploited all sorts of space behind the right-back through an advancing Matt Targett and Callum Wilson. It was in this corridor of uncertainty that the returning White picked up an eighth-minute booking after he failed to spot the run of Wilson quickly enough and clipped him over. It was clear that Newcastle were not here to milk the acclaim gently, as a testy exchange between Wilson and Gabriel in the far corner before the 20-minute mark had emphasised. They pushed their visitors back with increasing rhythm and one wondered how Arteta might have appreciated a player of the personality of Newcastle’s newly-crowned club player of the year Joelinton in the centre of the pitch, ball-winning and driving his team forward with vigour. What Arsenal did do is defend with heart, with White clearing from in front of the line from a low Emil Krafth delivery. The early ring rust gave way to genuine resolve, even if the ability to provide threat at the other end was thin on the ground. Arsenal repelled the home side’s first-half set-pieces with courage and conviction, which was a good job as there were plenty of them to face. At the other end a couple of typically rapid bursts from Bukayo Saka were the Gunners’ best way of escaping their own half and moving up the pitch, with the England winger their sole means of attacking threat. Dan Burn’s block from a Saka cross shot was the first time that Arsenal made a truly threatening sortie into the home side’s penalty box before he again cut in and drew a save, albeit a comfortable one, from Martin Dúbravka. The Arsenal manager decided early in the second half that there was certainly not enough of the required invention with Gabriel Martinelli promptly introduced to replace the near-invisible Emile Smith Rowe, and immediately the Brazilian added some zest to his team. Yet Wilson’s opener, created by the inexorable Joelinton’s burst down the left – in the gap left by the struggling Tomiyasu, who had exited late in the first half - and craftily snaffled at the near post, snatched the momentum from under them. Arteta, a typically twitchy presence on the touchline throughout, threw the kitchen sink at it, with the introduction of Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepé leaving his team with something resembling a front five. Urgency did not equal fluency and it was the home side, arguably the worst side in the division until one of the more sensible and incisive January transfer windows in recent memory, who found the greater clarity and carried the more menace. Worse was to come when Bruno Guimarães, an erstwhile Arsenal target, heroically blocked a Martin Ødegaard shot at one end and almost immediately tucked in a second after Ramsdale had foiled the excellent Wilson. Arteta and company were sunk and, if there could be little doubt over their will, they were taught a lesson in canniness by a side still forging their own personality.",Sport/Football,Arsenal are washed away as resurgent Newcastle ride wave of fan fervour | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/nervous-arsenal-washed-away-on-tide-of-newcastle-optimism
5/17/2022,"Labour aims to put ministers on the spot over the cost of living by forcing a Commons vote on a windfall tax for North Sea energy profits, amid some signs of increasing support for the policy on Conservative benches. Before the vote, to be instigated by an amendment to the Queen’s speech on Tuesday, Labour released calculations that forecast North Sea oil and gas profits for 2022/23 would be greater than all UK households have paid in increased energy bills. The government was “simply running out of excuses” to not impose a one-off levy on profits boosted by high energy prices, money that could be channelled to help with bills, said Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow energy secretary. While the Labour amendment refocuses attention on an issue proving increasingly uncomfortable for ministers, and the party has had recent success with other parliamentary procedures such as humble address motions, an amendment to the Queen’s speech is highly unlikely to pass. The wider idea of the tax is nonetheless gaining some momentum among Conservatives, with public supporters including Robert Halfon, the senior backbencher who is a leading Tory voice on cost of living issues, and Mel Stride, the former minister who chairs the Commons Treasury committee. Zac Goldsmith, the peer whose ministerial role covers the environment department and Foreign Office, argued that a windfall tax would help both with reaching net-zero targets and cost-of-living pressures. Goldsmith told the Guardian that people “need something they actually feel – directly”, adding: “So many are struggling at the moment.” At least one other junior minister has told colleagues they back the idea. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is the most vehement cabinet opponent of a windfall tax. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, does not support the idea, but has indicated it could be necessary if energy firms do not sufficiently reinvest the additional money. The Labour amendment would add wording saying that MPs “respectfully regret that the Gracious Speech fails to announce a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas producers, in order to provide much needed relief from energy price increases for households”. Labour’s calculations, based on estimating future North Sea profits based on tax receipts for 2022/23 projected by the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggest that total profits for the year will be £19.5bn, up from £11.75bn the year before. The 2022/23 total is less than the estimated £18.8bn cost to the UK’s 27.8m households of a price cap rise of £680. “It’s time the government dropped their threadbare excuses, did the right thing and put a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to deliver real help for families and pensioners,” Miliband said.",News/Politics,Labour to try to force Commons vote on North Sea windfall tax,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/16/labour-commons-north-sea-windfall-tax-cost-of-living-tory
5/17/2022,"Well played, Jake Daniels. Applause, please. And thank you for your leadership. Football, sport, male environments and, indeed, the wider world have all become slightly more sane places with the news that Daniels has decided to discuss publicly the fact that he is not only a professional footballer but a gay man. The first part of this is, of course, not remarkable. The second part is. To those unfamiliar with football’s internal workings it might seen genuinely loopy that this should even be news, that a trailblazer is required, and indeed that this should turn out to be a teenager who made his debut for Blackpool two weeks ago. But make no mistake this is both a remarkable moment for men’s professional football and a sterling show of courage from a 17‑year‑old, yet to establish himself in his industry; but unwilling, as he says, “to pretend”. For men’s football – and indeed men’s sport, professional and amateur – this is the sound of a wall being torn down. It is 32 years since Justin Fashanu became the first and until now only male British professional footballer to come out as gay, in his case via a salacious newspaper splash. Fashanu played on for seven years in various leagues, but he suffered terribly at the hands of his sport, his family and the wider public. Thomas Hitzlsperger, a Premier League player and German international, revealed in retirement that he is gay. The Australian Josh Cavallo came out last year, aged 22, and is playing regularly for Adelaide United in the A-League. Beyond this women’s sports have shown the way on this front. Openly gay players and indeed managers are a part of the everyday landscape in women’s football. The England women’s cricket team has a long-term couple in it. Men’s cricket had a flash of light when Steven Davies came out while he was still an England player 11 years ago. Davies is still going strong. But he is yet to be followed by anyone else. And this is the real significance of Daniels’s openness, and indeed why none of this should be taken lightly. It is temping to shrug and tut at football, to chide it for lagging behind the more liberated sections of society. But the fact is football does, as ever, reflect its environment. And there is a massive problem still with homophobia in Britain and the wider world, from everyday abuse and violence, to the anxiety young people might have over coming out to parents and friends, to institutional and religious intolerance. Daniels’s courage will speak to all those other footballers – and there have of course been plenty – who have lived through that narrow culture. It will provide a different model, a different version of the future for young people playing the sport now at any level. But it will have resonance beyond, too. People do need role models. The backing for Daniels from his club, the FA and the PFA is significant and not just within the sport. Yes, normal life is simply being normalised here. Slow handclap, football. What kept you? But society is not always nice or liberal or progressive. This is football using its platform in a good way. It will, of course, be far from straightforward. Daniels will face other barriers. There will be kickback and resistance, from misguided banter to genuine abuse; to moments of awkwardness and doubt, the micro-adjustments others will have to make in this deeply ritualistic male industry. Things are never as easy as we might hope. But listening to him speak it was impossible not to feel proud and also protective. It has required remarkable strength and clarity of mind to take this step aged 17. Football will now goggle a little, scratch its head and search for the right words. The best response is, as ever, support, admiration and the freedom from here just to play.",Sport/Football,"Thanks for your leadership, Jake Daniels: a gay man and professional footballer | Barney Ronay",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/16/thanks-for-your-leadership-jake-daniels-a-gay-man-and-professional-footballer
5/17/2022,"Special constables will be given access to stun guns as part of a flurry of crime initiatives, the home secretary will tell the Police Federation on Tuesday. Speaking at their conference in Manchester, Priti Patel will announce that part-time special constables will be allowed to use electroshock weapons – if properly trained and with the authorisation of chief officers. But Amnesty International UK’s policing expert warned that arming volunteer officers is “dangerous” and will inevitably lead to “more instances of misuse, serious harm and death from Tasers”. It is part of a range of measures included in “Operation Sceptre” – the name given to the government’s crime-fighting week. A controversial measure announced on Monday will allow officers to stop and search people without reasonable grounds. Police chiefs say they did not ask ministers for such changes. The government announced that changes to stop and search without suspicion, so-called section 60 stops, would now be made permanent. Section 60 stops have huge racial disproportionality, with black people 18 times more likely to be stopped than white people, official figures show. A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) told the Guardian: “While we have regular conversations with government about our powers, this was not directly asked for by the National Police Chiefs’ Council. “It is our responsibility to ensure that we balance tackling crime with building trust and confidence in our communities, learning from instances where we have not always got the balance right. “Section 60 powers to stop and search anyone within a designated area can be effective when there have been violent incidents or officers believe there is a high risk of violence occurring. Senior officers authorise them with the intention of saving lives and preventing people from coming to any harm. “We will work with the government to consider how any change to the powers can be used in practice, in a proportionate and consistent way. Section 60 is not a new power for policing, but this provides clarity on how the legislation can be used.” A 2021 report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary about stop and search highlighted concerns about section 60. It said: “Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are 6.7 times more likely to be searched under section 60 than white people, and black people are 18.1 times more likely. Forces need to analyse their data to understand why.” Under section 60, police can declare people in an area as being subject to searches without officers needing reasonable suspicion. Curbs were put in place in 2014 when Theresa May was home secretary. Stop and search remains a fault line between police and communities. Now police can use section 60 with the threshold changing from the belief that serious violence “will occur”, to “may occur”. But in a press release published last night, the government said restricting section 60 has “limited when officers could use the vital power and hindered their ability to rid the streets of dangerous weapons … By making it easier for the police to seize more weapons, the government is backing forces to drive down knife crime and save more lives.” Section 60 authorisations can stay in place longer, be authorised and extended by an officer of lower rank than previously, and the public do not have to be told that it has been enacted. Compared with when David Cameron and Theresa May were in power, the current Conservative government believes police should do more stops and with fewer restrictions, citing thousands of weapons taken off the streets as a result. Most people who are stopped are found to have nothing on them that is illegal. Leaked documents show that most of the public do not believe ministers’ promises to tackle crime, the Guardian reported last month. Polling carried out for the government showed that, despite fear of crime being high, few trusted ministers to be able to get to grips with it. Only one in three of those surveyed had faith it could tackle crime, its own document notes: “Current initiatives to tackle crime are not cutting through to the public – only around a third (35%) say they have confidence in the government’s handling of crime and justice, and awareness of the beating crime plan is low.”",News/UK news,Special constables to be given access to stun guns in new crime measures,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/special-constables-to-be-given-access-to-stun-guns-in-new-measures
5/17/2022,"Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah will be fit for the Champions League final, Jürgen Klopp has confirmed. The manager said the pair would miss Liverpool’s trip to Southampton on Tuesday but could return for the Premier League finale against Wolves. Liverpool’s influential defender and leading goalscorer were substituted during the FA Cup win against Chelsea with knee and groin issues respectively. Both will be absent at St Mary’s Stadium, where a Liverpool win would reduce Manchester City’s lead in the title race to one point with one game to play, but there are no concerns over their involvement against Real Madrid on 28 May. Klopp planned to rest Van Dijk at Southampton before injury intervened. Klopp, asked whether Salah or Van Dijk could feature on Tuesday, replied: “No. Virgil definitely not. That was pretty much clear before the game already. We thought this was the game [to rest him] because he played really a lot. Saturday-Tuesday again was clear. “They are both OK. The target for both would be that they could be involved again at the weekend. Properly involved. On the bench and on for a few minutes or start – we will see with that because that would be perfect for the [Madrid] game. If not, we take each day afterwards. It is very positive and we have no doubt about the Champions League final but we are pretty realistic about the Wolves game. But tomorrow, not.” Klopp has reiterated that the financial package it would take to sign Kylian Mbappé is beyond Liverpool’s means. The France international is expected to join Real Madrid when his contract at Paris Saint-Germain expires next month, although there have been reports of another club entering the race for the striker. Klopp, who tried to sign Mbappé from Monaco, insists it is not Liverpool. “Of course we are interested in Kylian Mbappé; we are not blind,” he said. “I have nothing to say about that [a reported approach] but between Kylian and Liverpool it’s all set, it’s all fine. We of course like him and if you don’t like him then you have to question yourself but, no, we are not, we cannot, be part of these battles. There must be other clubs involved and that is fine. He is a great player.” Klopp, meanwhile, has said there must be good reason why fans of the club booed Abide With Me, the Duke of Cambridge and the national anthem before the FA Cup final on Saturday. “In these situations I think it’s always best to ask the question: ‘Why do they do it? I know our people well enough that they would not do it if there was no reason. I am not here long enough to understand the reason. It’s for sure something historical, and that’s a question you can answer better than I ever could. “Our fans, and I know a few fans from other clubs see it slightly differently, the majority are wonderful people, smart and go through lows and highs, suffer together. They wouldn’t do it if there was no reason. That’s what I know. Maybe we should ask this question.” The Liverpool manager’s stance drew criticism from Boris Johnson’s official spokesman, who said there was no reason to boo the national anthem and it was a “great shame” given the FA Cup is meant to “bring people together”.",Sport/Football,Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah to miss Liverpool’s trip to Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/virgil-van-dijk-and-mohamed-salah-to-miss-liverpools-trip-to-southampton
5/17/2022,"Elon Musk’s relationship with Twitter’s management has reached a new low after the social media company’s would-be-owner tweeted a poo emoji at the platform’s chief executive. The Tesla CEO was responding on Monday to a lengthy and nuanced thread posted by his Twitter counterpart, Parag Agrawal, explaining the company’s policy on spam accounts – an issue that had prompted Musk to announce on Friday that he was putting the $44bn (£36bn) deal on hold. Musk has disputed Twitter’s assertion that less than 5% of its users are fake or spam accounts and has said he will carry out his own audit. Agrawal explained that tackling automated spam accounts was a “dynamic” process that required fighting “sophisticated and hard to catch” actors. He added that some accounts that appear to be spam are in fact operated by real people. “The hard challenge is that many accounts which look fake superficially are actually real people. And some of the spam accounts which are actually the most dangerous – and cause the most harm to our users – can look totally legitimate on the surface,” he wrote. He added that estimating Twitter’s fake account numbers could not be done externally because the process required access to sensitive data such as IP addresses and phone numbers. Agrawal ended the thread with a link to a company blogpost on spam accounts, while revealing that Twitter had discussed how it estimated its spam number with Musk a week ago and that the company looked forward “to continuing the conversation with him”. Musk responded with a poo emoji, followed minutes later by asking how advertisers on Twitter knew what they were getting for their money. 💩 “So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,” he tweeted. On Saturday Musk tweeted that Twitter’s legal team had accused him of violating a non-disclosure agreement by revealing that the sample size for the social media platform’s checks on automated users was 100. Last month, Musk engaged with tweets criticizing Twitter employees, despite the entrepreneur agreeing not to “disparage” the company or its representatives while he completes the deal to acquire the social media platform. Musk’s behavior has prompted speculation that he is laying the groundwork to reprice the deal or walk away from it, which would carry the cost of a $1bn break fee for the world’s richest man. Some experts doubt whether the multibillionaire is serious about buying the company. “I honestly don’t know if Elon wants to buy Twitter,” said Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer on finance at Cornell University. “At first, I thought he wasn’t serious. Then he paired with banks and financiers and came up with a legitimate acquisition plan. Now he’s called a timeout about an issue that is both well known and should have no bearing on his future plan for the company. If it’s attention he’s seeking, he has it. But does he want to own Twitter? Did he ever?”",News/Technology,Musk sends Twitter CEO poo emoji as relations go down the toilet,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/16/elon-musk-twitter-ceo-poop-emoji
