5/6/2022,"Who is the greatest Marvel supervillain? Taika Waititi went on record this week to suggest that Christian Bale’s Gorr the God Butcher will soon be the biggest baddie in the pantheon, but as we’re yet to get so much as a glimpse of this alien killer of deities in advance materials, that’s still something of a moot point. “In my humble opinion, we have probably the best villain that Marvel’s ever had in Christian Bale,” the New Zealand film-maker told AP. Which got me thinking about some of the incredible antagonists the studio has given us. Who would you put in first place? This is a question whose parameters need to be defined. Is the greatest Marvel supervillain the one who had the most impact on the MCU? Or the one who drew the greatest gasps from audiences because the actor delivered the most eye-popping performance? If it’s the former then Thanos surely has to be up there with the worst of them. The nefarious Titan murdered half the universe’s population with the click of his fingers on the basis of what? Ill-conceived, wrong-headed binary statistics? It doesn’t get much more evil than that, and this alien invader’s machinations were terrible enough that they pretty much fuelled the MCU’s entire Phase Three. So our giant purple friend scores highly in terms of audience impact, too. It’s also probably one of the finest ever mo-cap performances, even if Josh Brolin ultimately got a little lost in the hi-tech architecture. How about Ultron? The devious artificial intelligence robot (voiced by James Spader) was certainly the most powerful supervillain yet seen when he achieved self-awareness for the first time in 2015. He gave Tony Stark his first crisis of conscience and helped usher Scarlet Witch into the arms of the Avengers. And yet it’s hard to argue with a bad guy who points out all humanity’s faults and seems to long merely for a world in which wild animals run free in a human-less paradise. Spader’s was also a less showy performance than we’ve seen elsewhere, being limited to that cold, machine-like voice. If scenery-chewing is your thing then Cate Blanchett’s Hela surely merits discussion. Despite being a “one and done” villain – so far she has only appeared in 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok – the slinky goddess of death tore the leather chaps out of Waititi’s movie with a performance of mascara-fuelled, rock-star splendour. It took the destruction of Asgard itself to stop her, otherwise she would probably be ruling over the nine realms to this day. Another Asgardian, albeit an adoptive one, we may want to consider is Loki. Tom Hiddleston’s character has raged and whined his way through more than half a dozen Marvel movies thus far, and with his own TV series. Only an actor with charisma to burn could get away with inviting the hideous Chitauri to invade Earth, thereby destroying half of New York, and still emerge as a fan favourite. The God of Mischief may currently be stuck in an alternate timeline, and we’re not sure if he’ll appear in the forthcoming Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Given Patrick Stewart’s Professor X is rumoured to be making a return, and we’ve just seen half of Sony’s bad-guy back catalogue turn up in Spider-Man: No Way Home, all bets are off. Which brings us to Alfred Molina’s Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin. Despite having first appeared in Sony’s Spider-Man movies from the early noughties, they are now firmly established as Marvel Cinematic Universe villains after the events of Jon Watts’ epic finale to the Home trilogy – aren’t they? Does this mean those earlier films are also part of the MCU canon? If they were, these two would undoubtedly be in the top five. Molina was one of the first proper thespians to treat the role of supervillain seriously, his humanity always shining through the madness in 2004’s Spider-Man 2. Naturally he took his cue from Dafoe, whose ability to switch from horror-stricken victim to maniacal menace helped make 2000’s Spider-Man the greatest superhero movie of its time. Without Dafoe’s emotionally dextrous performance in No Way Home, that film’s introduction of the Multiverse, and the arrival of several villains from a different superhero universe, would never have been received so joyfully by audiences. For that reason alone, and to some controversy no doubt, I’m giving the Green Goblin the mantle of Marvel’s greatest supervillain. Of course, there are probably many alternate realities in which a different bad guy got picked – which one are you living in?",Arts/Film,Super bad: who is the greatest ever Marvel supervillain?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/06/greatest-ever-marvel-supervillain-christian-bale-gorr-thanos-loki
5/6/2022,"During the 2020 Democratic primary, Pete Buttigieg’s personal ambition led him to poison the conversation about education in America. Desperate for a contrast point with his rivals, the son of a private university professor aired ads blasting the idea of tuition-free college because he said it would make higher education “free even for the kids of millionaires.” The attack line, borrowed from former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, was cynicism masquerading as populism. It was an attempt to limit the financial and political benefits of a proposal to make college free. Worse, it was disguised as a brave stand against the oligarchs bankrolling Buttigieg’s campaign, even though it actually wasn’t – almost no rich scions would benefit from free college. Buttigieg and copycats like Amy Klobuchar were pushing a larger lie. Call it the means-testing con – the idea that social programs should not be universal, and should instead only be available to those who fall below a certain income level. It is a concept eroding national unity and being carried forward by wealthy pundits and a Democratic party that has discarded the lessons of its own universalist triumphs like social security, Medicare and the GI Bill. This week the Biden administration tore a page from Buttigieg’s book. The White House leaked that it is considering finally following through on Joe Biden’s promise to cancel some student debt – but not the $50,000 pushed by congressional Democrats, and only for those below an income threshold. In trial-ballooning the college debt relief proposal, the president is boosting the media-manufactured fiction that real, universal college debt relief would mostly help rich Ivy League kids – even though data from the Roosevelt Institute conclusively proves that canceling student debt “would provide more benefits to those with fewer economic resources and could play a critical role in addressing the racial wealth gap and building the Black middle class”. As the report points out: “People from wealthy backgrounds (and their parents) rarely use student loans to pay for college.” But setting aside how the media-driven discourse omits those inconvenient facts, what’s noteworthy here is the underlying principle. This latest discussion of means-testing follows Biden and congressional Democrats pushing to substantially limit eligibility for Covid-19 survival checks and the expanded child tax credit. Taken together, it suggests that Democrats’ zeal for means-testing is no anomaly – it is a deeply held ideology that is both dangerous for the party’s electoral prospects and for the country’s fraying social contract. The superficial appeal of means-testing is obvious: it promises to prevent giving even more public money to rich people who don’t need it. But in practice, means-testing is a way to take simple universal programs and make them complicated and inaccessible. Calculating exact income levels and then proving them for eligibility means reams of red tape for both the potential beneficiary and a government bureaucracy that must be created to process that paperwork. Data from the food stamp and Medicaid programs illustrate how means-testing creates brutal time and administrative barriers to benefits, which reduce payouts to eligible populations. In the case of means-testing student debt relief, those barriers may end up wholly excluding large swaths of working-class debtors. This is a feature, not a bug – it is means-testers’ unstated objective. They want to limit benefits for the working class, but not admit that’s their goal. Universal programs like social security and Medicare were what we once defined as “society” or “civilization”. They may be derided as “entitlements”, but the reason they have (so far) survived for so long is because their universality makes them wildly successful in their missions and more difficult to demonize. Their universality also precludes austerians from otherizing and disparaging the programs’ recipients. Means-testing destroys that potential unity. It may initially poll well, but it turns “entitlements” into complicated “welfare” programs only for certain groups, which then makes those programs less popular and makes the beneficiaries easy scapegoats for political opportunists. Think of Ronald Reagan’s “welfare queen” trope vilifying recipients of means-tested food stamps. Now sure, billionaires are eligible for social security and Medicare, and their kids are eligible for free K-12 education – and that aristocracy doesn’t need that help. But when those programs were created, we accepted that rich people being granted access to those programs along with everyone else was the relatively small price to pay for simplicity, universalism and the attendant national unity that comes with it. Not surprisingly, Democrats’ creation of popular universalist programs coincided with the most electorally successful era in the party’s history. Equally unsurprising: the shift to fake means-test populism has coincided with rising popular hatred of liberal technocrats and the Democratic party they control. What is surprising is that Republicans may be starting to understand all this better than Democrats. For instance, Donald Trump’s signature spending legislation offered direct, non-means-tested aid to small businesses during the pandemic. The former president touted a plan to just pay hospital bills for Covid patients who didn’t have coverage. The programs were hardly perfect, but they were straightforward, universal, relatively successful and extremely popular because they embodied a powerful principle: keep it simple, stupid. When it comes to student debt relief, there’s a rare chance for Democrats to also embrace simplicity – and prevent Republicans from outflanking them. More specifically, they can use the student debt crisis to finally return to their universalist roots – and they don’t have to skimp and provide merely $10,000 worth of relief. Biden could simply send out a one-page letter to every student borrower telling them that their federal student debt is now $0. Yes, Republican lawmakers would try to block it and affluent pundits would tweet-cry about it to each other. But amid all that elite whining and couch-fainting, Democrats would be launching a battle against an immoral system of education debt – and directly helping 40 million voters ahead of a midterm election. It’s so easy and simple – which is probably why they won’t do it. David Sirota is a Guardian US columnist and an award-winning investigative journalist.

5/6/2022,"The surest way to lose a battle is to not fight. Despite this fairly obvious logic, President Joe Biden and too many Democrats seem to have adopted a political strategy for the midterm elections of avoiding as many fights as possible. This path-of-least-resistance approach has resulted in plummeting presidential approval numbers and will further plunge the party off the cliff in the midterms if Democrats do not quickly reverse course. To turn things around, Biden should leap into the fundamental fights over what are called “culture wars” – and he should do so with gusto. It is unmistakably clear that we are engaged in an existential battle over the very identity of this nation. Is the United States of America primarily a straight, white, cisgender, male, Christian country, or is it a multiracial and multicultural democracy? The adherents of the former view are waging war with glee and abandon. From rightwing state legislatures to the supreme court, they are holding nothing back in attacking voting by people of color, the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, multicultural education, reproductive freedom and commonsense public health protections during a global pandemic, to name just a few fronts in this fight. With the heartening exception of the attempts to defend Roe v Wade, Democrats, for their part, are shying away from almost all of these fights beyond tepid words of disapproval, hand-wringing, and low-profile and lethargic counter-measures such as lawsuits and investigations. The result is a sharp decline in enthusiasm among the people who put the White House and Congress in Democratic hands, contributing significantly to the drop in polling approval numbers. Support among people of color has dropped 24% from its highs of last year. At this pace, Democrats will in fact lose the midterm elections, but it does not need to be so, and they can absolutely turn things around if they engage the fight. The misguided strategy that got us here results from bad math and electoral myopia by Democratic strategists and advisers. Despite an avalanche of empirical data, Democrats still do not believe that the majority of people are on their side. Yet with one exception (in 2004), the Democratic nominee has won the popular vote in every presidential election since 1992. The progressive trend is only accelerating as more and more young people – the majority of whom are people of color or white progressives – turn 18 every day. Every eight seconds, someone turns 18 and becomes eligible to vote. Democrats are so obsessed with wooing conservative white working-class voters that they fail to see the ever-increasing ranks of people of color who can strengthen their political hand. I call this phenomenon being “blinded by the white”. Fear of alienating an elusive white constituency has paralyzed a party in desperate need of decisive and bold action. The very fact that Democrats control the executive and legislative branches is proof that the worldview that America is and should be a multiracial nation enjoys majority support. In high-turnout elections such as presidential races, the majority usually supports the Democrat. The question for the midterms is how much of that majority will be sufficiently motivated to come back out and vote. The reason that the party that controls the White House typically fares poorly in midterm elections is that that party’s supporters tend to get complacent and do not see the urgent need to turn out and vote again. That is why it’s essential to engage in the fight. The failure to fight is dispiriting to one’s supporters and a significant contributor to falling polling numbers. Biden’s advisers believe that engaging in fights will harm their popularity, but the painful reality is that there is not much popularity left to harm. By throwing himself into the raging battles with gusto, he can reverse his polling descent and save Democratic control of Congress. Here are four examples of how he can send a strong signal to the electorate and inspire his supporters to mobilize to vote this fall. Reproductive freedom summit: The White House should host a strategy summit with leaders in the reproductive rights movement and women’s healthcare field to discuss ways to fight back on restrictive legislation and expand access to healthcare for all women. Say gay conference: Biden should organize a presidential “We Say Gay” conference in Florida as an in-your-face rebuttal to the homophobic legislation by Florida’s governor and legislature. In fact, he could hold the conference in Disneyworld, which is the target of punitive measures by the state government for its gay-friendly policies. That would have the added advantage of engaging the business community in the fight for equality. Read banned books: Biden should go to Texas, where nearly 1 million eligible African Americans didn’t vote in 2020, and hold an event at a school where he reads to students from Toni Morrison’s Bluest Eye, a book about Black identity. Multiple school districts in Texas have banned Morrison’s books, and Biden would send a strong signal by reading from the book and even bringing copies to hand out to students. Go door-to-door with voter registration groups: In the face of all of the voter suppression legislation sweeping the south and south-west, Biden should show his solidarity with groups working to expand democracy and encourage Americans to register to vote. He can go to Phoenix, where the Arizona legislature is trying to make it harder to vote, and go precinct-walking with members of a Latino-led, community-based organization such as Lucha. He could couple that with a speech at a local high school where he encourages senior-year students to come forward and register on the spot. These are just a few examples of how Biden could use his bully pulpit to lead the fight to make America the multiracial democracy that the majority of people want it to be. Such high-profile and, yes, controversial initiatives are both the right thing to do and the smart strategic step. They will inspire and mobilize the base, redefine the nature of the fight so that Democrats are on the offensive, and solidify Biden’s role as a strong and resolute leader. If he can find the courage to take such steps, Biden will reshape the political debate and put the Democrats on the path to victory in the midterms.

5/6/2022,"On Monday night, Politico reported that a majority of the US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, eviscerate a half-century of precedent, and leave the issue of abortion to the states. Five of the court’s nine justices are prepared to give the Republican base exactly what it demanded. The remaining question for the Republican party is whether answered prayers are the most dangerous. If the leaked draft of the majority opinion in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization is close to the final cut, the court stands to energize otherwise dejected Democrats and put Republican members of Congress in Democratic-leaning states at risk. Expect the anticipated Republican House majority in the midterms to be smaller than currently projected. Indeed, the Democrats also now have a real shot to maintain their control of the Senate. Overnight, their odds of retaining seats in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and New Hampshire, while flipping Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, improved. Beyond federal offices, fights will now be waged this fall over governorships and legislatures in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020, but where the incumbent governor is a Democrat, and the legislature is in the hands of the Republican party. In a post-Dobbs world, look to the states to emerge as roiling battlegrounds. Make no mistake, the draft opinion is sweeping. “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Justice Samuel Alito writes for himself and four of his colleagues. “It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” Along the way, the ruling also offers implicit criticism of the court’s prior decisions on personal autonomy. Prior precedents on contraception, interracial marriage, consensual sex and gay marriage are now at risk. At a February debate among Michigan’s prospective Republican candidates for attorney general, all three men, including Matthew DePerno, Donald Trump’s choice, criticized Griswold v Connecticut. In that case, the US supreme court struck down a state law that barred the sale of contraceptives to married couples. DePerno, an advocate of election conspiracy theories, framed his understanding of this this way: “The supreme court … has to decide, mark my words, that the privacy issue currently is unworkable. It’s going to be a states’ rights issue on all these things, as it should be.” DePerno is also the state Republican party’s officially preferred candidate. Elissa Slotkin, a moderate Michigan Democrat, tweeted on Monday night: “If tonight’s news is true, Michigan’s 1931 state law banning abortion would snap back into effect, making any abortion illegal in our state – even if the mom will die, or if she was raped by a family member. No exceptions.” A former member of the US intelligence community and the wife of a retired army helicopter pilot, Slotkin added: “My poor mother is turning over in her grave. The House has already voted to codify Roe – let all Senators be on record on this one in an up or down vote.” In the same neo-Confederate spirit as Michigan’s DePerno, the Indiana senator Mike Braun offered up his benighted take on interracial marriage. Braun argued that like abortion, interracial marriage should be left to the states to decide – not the federal judiciary. Said differently, he was arguing that the supreme court got it wrong in Loving v Virginia. “When you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules and proceedings, they’re going to be out of sync with maybe what other states would do,” Braun announced. “It’s the beauty of the system, and that’s where the differences among points of view in our 50 states ought to express themselves.” After the ensuing uproar, Braun walked his words back. But in light of Politico’s reporting, the Democrats now have names, faces and an issue. Think ready-made campaign ad. To be sure, clearer Republican heads viewed the wholesale gutting of Roe as a threat to the Republican party’s elected officials. In the summer of 2021, they attempted to guide the court’s hand; they failed. Last July, 228 Republican members of Congress, 44 senators and 184 House members, filed an amicus brief in support of the Mississippi abortion law in question. Nowhere did the Republican submission refer to contraception, interracial marriage, or individual autonomy. Likewise, the word “privacy” only appeared as a part of a title of a footnoted law review article. Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert couched their arguments in pastels. Words like “previability” filled the page, as did polling data. Justices Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, however, were having none of that. For them, it is time to return to what they consider the original constitution. More than seven in 10 Americans oppose overturning Roe even as the public is split over where to draw a line. In Texas, 77% support legal abortions in case of rape and incest. Not all restrictions are the same. America’s cold civil war just got really hot. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York.

5/6/2022,"Good morning. A third United Nations operation was under way this morning to evacuate Ukrainian civilians from the Russian-besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, which the UN secretary general has described as a series of “hellscapes”. An estimated 200 civilians, along with Ukrainian resistance fighters, remain trapped in underground refuges at the huge industrial complex. The UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said a convoy was headed to Azovstal “to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell … and take them back to safety”. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said people would be evacuated from Mariupol at midday local time on Friday. The UN and the Red Cross said they had so far helped nearly 500 civilians flee the steelworks area in the southern port city during two operations in the past week. Meanwhile, US officials have reportedly confirmed they are providing intelligence that has helped Ukrainian forces target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in the Ukraine war. Why is Putin so determined to capture Mariupol over the next few days? As Victory Day, 9 May, approaches in Russia, Vladimir Putin has yet to win any prize in two months of war in Ukraine that can be shown off to the Russian people. But Mariupol could be close. Here’s how Victory Day became central to Putin’s idea of Russian identity. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 72 of the invasion. Joe Biden has named his new press secretary, after it was announced that Jen Psaki will leave the administration and is expected to become a TV host at MSNBC. Karine Jean-Pierre, currently the principal deputy press secretary, will take over the role after Psaki leaves in mid-May. Jean-Pierre, a political analyst, was Kamala Harris’s chief of staff during the vice-president’s presidential campaign in 2020 and served on Barack Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. She was also an adviser and spokesperson for MoveOn.org, a progressive Pac. Jean-Pierre will be the first Black person and first out gay person in the role. She has filled in for Psaki on several occasions, most recently while her predecessor was quarantining with Covid-19. “She is passionate. She is smart and she has a moral core that makes her not just a great colleague, but an amazing mom and human,” Psaki tweeted. “Plus, she has a great sense of humor.” What has Biden said about her appointment? Biden lauded Jean-Pierre’s “experience, talent and integrity”. He said: “Jill and I have known and respected Karine a long time and she will be a strong voice speaking for me and this administration.” When will Psaki leave? Her last day will be 13 May. Republicans in Louisiana have advanced a bill to make abortion a crime of murder, as a draft decision that would end abortion rights continues to spark nationwide protests and police in Washington raised “non-scalable” fences around the supreme court. Supporters admitted the bill, under which a woman terminating a pregnancy or anyone assisting her could be charged, was unconstitutional – as long as Roe v Wade was law. The supreme court is expected to formally overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that established the right to abortion, in June. Danny McCormick, the state representative behind the Louisiana bill, said: “We can’t wait on the supreme court.” Since the draft ruling that seems set to overturn Roe was published by Politico on Monday night, Democrats have warned of a likely torrent of challenges to established rights. What else is happening? Extreme anti-abortion groups are now emboldened to fight for laws that ban ending pregnancies conceived in rape or incest. How have the medical community reacted? “If this decision ends up being similar to what [was leaked], this is going to substantially affect abortion care, obstetrics care and healthcare more generally,” said Dr Nisha Verma, a Darney-Landy fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Local Conservative leaders in the UK have urged the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to consider his position after losing flagship London councils to Labour and council seats across the south of England to the Lib Dems, with several blaming Partygate and the cost of living crisis. A week before election day 2020, the US secretary of defense was so worried that Donald Trump would seek to involve the military in the election in an attempt to hold on to power, he told the general commanding the US national guard to notify him of any communication from anyone at the White House. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has confirmed there is no intention to turn away from China’s zero-Covid commitment, in a major speech that also warned against any criticism of the policy. He defended the “scientific and effective” mass lockdowns despite protests, shortages and damage to economic growth. Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is not expected to appear at an interview scheduled for today with the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack, throwing into jeopardy the prospect of his cooperation, say sources familiar with the matter. US stock markets suffered their worst day of the year on Thursday as investors worried about the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates to tackle soaring inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 1,000 points (3.1%). The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.5% and 4.9% respectively. Tech stocks were particularly hard-hit, with Amazon dropping 7.6% and Tesla falling 8.3%. The steep fall came one day after the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, announced the sharpest rise in interest rates in more than 20 years. Lee Grant, child of the Depression, survivor of the anti-communist blacklist, director, Oscar winner and – incredibly – 95 and looking nothing of the sort, is standing in her Manhattan kitchen.

I don’t know what.” Experience makes her confident: something always turns up. “Life is like that. You slip to another place, go into another world, and you’re curious, and you take sides. And it’s a kind of miracle.” Firefighters in New Mexico have slowed the advance of the largest wildfire burning in the US, as Joe Biden declared the situation a disaster. The extent of the fire is not a surprise to experts.

5/6/2022,"When Edgar becomes the ruler of England at the end of King Lear, he pledges to build a country in which people “speak what we feel, not what we ought to say”. But increasingly there is the possibility of jurors for the 2022 TV Baftas using their votes to do the opposite – which complicates the task of predicting the winners. Sometimes this will arise from the proper and necessary pressure for more diversity. However, this may raise dilemmas for those who objectively feel that a non-progressive veteran has done the best work of the year. And, with Channel 4 and the BBC under threat of reform from the government, there may be a temptation to back them for symbolic reasons. Conversely, some panellists may fear that honouring a great programme about Donald Trump is somehow honouring the notorious 45th president. So the definition of “the best” is even more hedged than in the past. Here are my views on what should/will win.  In My Skin (BBC Three) Manhunt: The Night Stalker (ITV) Unforgotten (ITV) Vigil (BBC One) After four series of twisty-plotted writing, Chris Lang’s cold case series Unforgotten has never won a Bafta. So, with Vigil getting higher marks for atmosphere than logicality, it really should be Unforgotten. But a surprise win for In My Skin in the best writer section at the earlier Bafta Craft awards suggests a challenge from Kayleigh Llewellyn’s teen angst drama here.  It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Landscapers (Sky Atlantic/HBO) Stephen (ITV) Time (BBC One) In a gold-bronze-silver run off, Landscapers would miss the podium. It’s a photo-finish between the other three, but It’s A Sin had the most complex subject matter and Russell T Davies – after being an also-ran for the equally excellent Years And Years and A Very English Scandal – deserves first place.  Call My Agent! (Netflix) Lupin (Netflix) Mare of Easttown (Sky Atlantic/HBO) Squid Game (Netflix) Succession (Sky Atlantic/HBO) The Underground Railroad (Amazon Prime) This jury may still be arguing now. The impossibility of adjudicating between six of the most impactful dramas of the last decade – let alone last year – will surely drive pressure for more than an International category for 2023. Until then, if those who claim that Netflix has peaked are right, its trio in this line-up represents a high watermark. Mare of Easttown, Succession and Call My Agent have the best writing and acting, but Squid Game was a cultural phenomenon. That said, I’d – just – go for Mare of Easttown.  Death of England: Face to Face (Sky Arts) Help (Channel 4) I am Victoria (Channel 4) Together (BBC Two) Future historians will note that all four contenders touch on the Covid pandemic. The National Theatre could also win its first Bafta for Death of England, Roy Williams’ and Clint Dyer’s film about British racial politics, shot in the locked-down building. But if Channel 4 is hoping for a load of trophies to wave at the government, its campaign should be helped by the likely victory of Help.  David Thewlis – Landscapers (Sky Atlantic/HBO) Hugh Quarshie – Stephen (ITV) Olly Alexander – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Samuel Adewunmi – You Don’t Know Me (BBC One) Sean Bean – Time (BBC One) Stephen Graham – Help (Channel 4) A good example of expanded shortlists (there used to be only four names) allowing true diversity. The “next generation” case is strongly made by Olly Alexander’s gay tragic hero in It’s A Sin, against the “great generation” represented by Sean Bean as a repenting prisoner in Time, although Bean is ironically under pressure from his Time co-star, Stephen Graham, as a Covid care home patient in Help. Graham has strong acting heat around him but this probably will – and just about should – be Alexander’s.  Denise Gough – Too Close (ITV) Emily Watson – Too Close (ITV) Jodie Comer – Help (Channel 4) Kate Winslet – Mare of Easttown (Sky Atlantic/HBO) Lydia West – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Niamh Algar – Deceit (Channel 4) Comer’s role as a carer in Help confirms that she has the talent to become an all-time great. However, as a guilty detective in Mare of Easttown, Winslet gave one of the most physically, psychologically and vocally precise performances ever seen on TV, and it would be bold to knock back an Oscar, Emmy and Bafta Film winner at her first bid for a Bafta TV trophy.  Callum Scott Howells – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) David Carlyle – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Matthew Macfadyen – Succession (HBO/Sky Atlantic) Nonso Anozie – Sweet Tooth (Netflix) Omari Douglas – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Stephen Graham – Time (BBC One) The inclusion of three men from It’s A Sin, though huge kudos for the show, probably prevents one of them winning, especially if (naughty as it is) panellists gamble on the best actor judges doing right by Olly Alexander. Stephen Graham has an unusual chance of taking both Actor and Supporting in the same year and would deserve to, but there was widespread dismay that Macfadyen missed out last year for his brilliant performance in Quiz, and Succession is admired as TV at its finest, so he would be a very popular victor.  Cathy Tyson – Help (Channel 4) Céline Buckens – Showtrial (BBC One) Emily Mortimer – The Pursuit of Love (BBC One) Jessica Plummer – The Girl Before (BBC One) Leah Harvey – Foundation (Apple TV+) Tahirah Sharif – The Tower (ITV) Very unusually, most of the performances here came in shows with an indifferent critical reception. That may help Tyson, in the acclaimed and multi-nominated Help, and Sharif, who brought subtlety to The Tower, with Tyson probably just ahead.  The Graham Norton Show (BBC One) The Lateish Show With Mo Gilligan (Channel 4) Race Around Britain (YouTube) The Ranganation (BBC Two) The choice between established talent and exciting newcomer is rarely as clear as between one of the all-time greats – Graham Norton, eight wins in this genre, five nominations – and Munya Chawawa, whose super fresh Race Around Britain makes YouTube a serious player. Bafta probably will – and should – choose Chawawa.  Fearless: The Women Fighting Putin (ITV) Four Hours at the Capitol (BBC Two) The Men Who Sell Football (Al Jazeera English) Trump Takes on the World (BBC Two) The category in which “message voting” will have been most likely. BBC Two’s pair of end-of-Trump shows feel the strongest, with my preference for the great documentarian Norma Percy’s Trump Takes On The World. But Fearless, featuring three opponents of President Putin, feels the likely winner.  The Chase (ITV) Moneybags (Channel 4) Richard Osman’s House of Games (BBC Two) Steph’s Packed Lunch (Channel 4) If “hands off Channel 4, Nadine Dorries” has been a factor in the ballots, this category offers two opportunities out of four, both products of the north-based UK content strategy that is one of the network’s defences against privatisation, although Steph’s Packed Lunch has controversially low ratings. The Chase and House of Games are two schedule thoroughbreds, but Moneybags seems the frontrunner, as a pertinent advert for Channel 4’s purposes.  Alison Hammond: I Can See Your Voice (BBC One) Big Zuu: Big Zuu’s Big Eats (Dave) Graham Norton: The Graham Norton Show (BBC One) Joe Lycett: Joe Lycett’s Got Your Back (Channel 4) Michael McIntyre: Michael McIntyre’s The Wheel (BBC One) Sean Lock: 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown (Channel 4) This jury has to choose between two much admired living comedians (Graham Norton, Michael McIntyre) and a recently dead one: Sean Lock. He would be a popular winner but, in the past, the Baftas, like the Oscars, have shown reluctance to pick dead nominees. Alison Hammond is more admirable than the format she’s listed for and, with a possible feeling that Norton’s cabinet trophy is full enough, my hunch is that this will be Big Zuu v Joe Lycett, with the consumer reparations remit of the latter’s Got Your Back proving attractive in a cost-of-living crisis.  An Audience With Adele (ITV) Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway (ITV) Life & Rhymes (Sky Arts) Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One) Not the section for jurors hoping to refresh the winner lists. Takeaway and Strictly are habitual shortlistees and former winners. Socially committed poetry show Life & Rhymes took the trophy last year. Even the least obvious contender was shortlisted for Adele at the BBC in 2016. But the Strictly showreel will surely have included 2021’s first two-man couple and the first deaf contestant/winner, making an unanswerable case for a 19-season series having found new ground.  The Detectives: Fighting Organised Crime (BBC Two) 9/11: One Day in America (National Geographic) Undercover Police: Hunting Paedophiles (Channel 4) Uprising (BBC One) Steve McQueen, the only person to have won an Oscar and a Turner prize, should have added a Bafta TV award for Small Axe last year and surely now must for Uprising, his and James Rogan’s three-parter about the New Cross fire of 1981, an eerie warning (ignored) of future racial injustices including Grenfell.  Big Zuu’s Big Eats (Dave) Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing (BBC Two) Sort Your Life Out (BBC One) The Great British Sewing Bee (BBC One) Likely the most gentle judging meeting with two cosy formats – celebrity angling and amateur needlework – up against a slightly edgier food show and a domestic decluttering format. I suspect Dave can dust its not overloaded awards shelf as Liverpool FC supporter Big Zuu takes one of the few trophies his team can’t win this year.  Aimee Lou Wood – Sex Education (Netflix) Aisling Bea – This Way Up (Channel 4) Anjana Vasan – We Are Lady Parts (Channel 4) Natasia Demetriou – Stath Lets Flats (Channel 4) Rose Matafeo – Starstruck (BBC Three) Sophie Willan – Alma’s Not Normal (BBC Two) With 50% of the shortlist and an indignant anti-privatisation mood within the industry, Channel 4 feels strongly placed to win and, from its trio, Anjana Vasan feels the most deserving choice for the glorious Muslim punk band sitcom We Are Lady Parts.  Jamie Demetriou – Stath Lets Flats (Channel 4) Joe Gilgun – Brassic (Sky Max) Ncuti Gatwa – Sex Education (Netflix) Samson Kayo – Bloods (Sky One) Steve Coogan – This Time with Alan Partridge (BBC One) Tim Renkow – Jerk (BBC Three) What’s most interesting here is that five of the six are on minority channels, suggesting good comedy is only happening on the edge. Renkow, for his bold disability comedy, will possibly edge it over Sex Education’s Gatwa.  The Brit awards 2021 (ITV) The Earthshot prize 2021 (BBC One) The Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance (BBC One) Springwatch 2021 (BBC Two) This argument should hinge on editing and camerawork, but probably comes down to topicality/popularity of content. The Earthshot Prize, featuring royalty actual (Prince William) and televisual (David Attenborough) feels like the winner.  Channel 4 News: Black to Front (Channel 4) Good Morning Britain: Shamima Begum (ITV) ITV News at Ten: Storming of the Capitol (ITV) Sky News: Afghanistan: Endgame (Sky News) The Bafta category I’d cancel: how can technical excellence be separated from the emotive impact of the horrors covered? The biggest news is the absence of BBC content, signalling urgent work for new journalism supremo, Deborah Turness, incoming from ITN. To avoid the queasiness of choosing which war, riot or hostage situation matters more, the best choice would be the concept edition in which Channel 4 News used only people of colour.  Gogglebox (Channel 4) Married at First Sight (E4) RuPaul’s Drag Race (BBC Three) The Dog House (Channel 4) In my house, Delilah and Fred strongly believe that The Dog House should take the biscuit, and a human jury will also surely have been moved by this lovely attempt to match unwanted pets with owners also needing rescue. But I’ve warned my labrador and jack russell advocates that Rupaul’s Drag Race has a big following in the non-canine world and will be a threat.  Alma’s Not Normal (BBC Two) Motherland (BBC Two) Stath Lets Flats (Channel 4) We Are Lady Parts (Channel 4) Motherland went to new, darker areas in series three but, if there is pressure to go fresher, and given that Sophie Willan remarkably won the writer’s award last year for the pilot of Alma’s Not Normal, We Are Lady Parts would be my winner.  Hollyoaks Saved My Life (YouTube) Our Land (Together TV) People You May Know (Financial Times) Please Help (BBC Three) Viewers may feel they’ve accidentally switched over to the British Newspaper Awards if – and, I hope, when – the Financial Times takes a Bafta for its drama about data security in the pandemic, written by the super-talented James Graham.  9/11: Inside the President’s War Room (Apple TV+) Grenfell: The Untold Story (Channel 4) My Childhood, My Country – 20 Years in Afghanistan (ITV) Nail Bomber: Man Hunt (Netflix) Another concerning no-show for the BBC. Channel 4’s revelatory Grenfell investigation should win.  Casualty (BBC One) Coronation Street (ITV) Emmerdale (ITV) Holby City (BBC One) EastEnders will be miffed to have missed out. Holby City hasn’t won since 2008 and this is its last chance to enter as it finished in March. Expect the soap community to give a big send-off and a rebuke to the BBC bosses who binned it.  Black Power: A British Story of Resistance (BBC Two) Freddie Mercury: The Final Act (BBC Two) The Missing Children (ITV) Silenced: The Hidden Story of Disabled Britain (BBC Two) Steve McQueen’s extraordinary awards shelf could contain two TV Baftas if Uprising takes factual series and this one is won by Black Power, although McQueen’s colleague on both, James Rogan, is also up against them in this round for the bio-doc about the Queen frontman.  The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (Sky Sports) ITV Racing: The Grand National (ITV Sport) Tokyo 2020 Olympics (BBC One) Euro 2020 Semi-final: England v Denmark (ITV Sport) As usual in this category, you might as well draw lots. When I put them in a hat, the Grand Prix came out first, which is as good a bet as any.  An Audience With Adele: Adele surprised by the teacher who changed her life (ITV) I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Ant and Dec dig at Downing Street’s lockdown parties (ITV) It’s A Sin: Colin’s devastating Aids diagnosis (Channel 4) RuPaul’s Drag Race UK: “UK Hun?” – Bimini’s verse (BBC Three) Squid Game: Red Light, Green Light game (Netflix) Strictly Come Dancing: Rose and Giovanni’s silent dance (BBC One) Whereas other juries are encouraged to set emotion aside – with, arguably, increasingly little success – the public vote is strictly visceral. Feelings about the current government may drive clicks for Ant & Dec’s impressive political satire, but the crowd-pleaser (and a powerful use of TV) is the silent dance in Strictly.",Arts/Television & radio,It’s A Sin to Mare of Easttown: who will win the 2022 TV Bafta awards – and who really deserves to? ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/tv-bafta-awards-2022-predictions-its-a-sin-mare-of-easttown
5/6/2022,"Why will I love it?Fans of Little Shop of Horrors will love Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum, a monster of a plant that brings tropical vibes to every room. Light or shade?Indirect bright light. Where should I put it?In a large, empty area, as this plant takes up a lot of space, often reaching an ultimate spread and height of between two and four metres, although it is usually smaller when grown indoors. And beware: it is toxic to cats and dogs. How do I keep it alive?It appreciates warm, humid surroundings, so mist frequently and place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles if that’s not enough. It likes moist soil, so water weekly in summer – ensuring that only the top 5cm of soil dries out – and sparingly in winter. If the leaf tips dry out, it needs more humidity, more water or perhaps lower light exposure. You can cut around the brown tips with scissors and make the leaves look happy again. Did you know …The species name, bipinnatifidum, is made up of the Latin prefix bi, for “double”, and pinnatifidum, for “cut into the shape of a feather”, referring to the plant’s symmetrical, feather-like split leaves.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Houseplant of the week: cut-leaf philodendron,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/06/houseplant-of-the-week-cut-leaf-philodendron
5/6/2022,"There’s a whole suite of perennials in sunset shades that are perfect for darker corners. They will thrive in dappled shade, and with a sunny exuberance you might not expect in such areas. This is not the restrained, cool (dare I say slightly dull) elegance of the pure white forms; no, these come in cocktail colours of peach, pink and apricot. A group of woodlanders that belong to the fumitory subfamily of the poppy family have delicate fern-like foliage in blue-greens and grey-greens, and thrive in damp, shady conditions: one of these is Corydalis solida subsp solida “Beth Evans”, which is up and out now, with sugar-pink flowers. It grows not much higher than 20cm and forms a clump of about the same size; it needs rich soil and to be next to neighbours that won’t muscle it out. In a similar vein, but with more glaucous foliage, is Dicentra “Filigree” with its deep pink-red flowers, and Dicentra formosa with mauvish-pink flowers that dangle over the leaves. All of these look wonderful with smaller-leaved hostas, such as Tiarella “Pink Skyrocket” or ferns. I love the coppery-red new growth of the shield fern Dryopteris erythrosora, with its triangular leaves. It is slow-growing enough to not overwhelm the others, though is not completely hardy. A fully hardy choice would be Polystichum setiferum “Herrenhausen”, with its lacy rosette of finely divided leaves. One of our loveliest native ferns, it complements whatever it sits next to in a woodland setting. These things are all a little low-growing, however, and many will die back for summer, so it is wise to add something that will lift the eye away from spent foliage. Digitalis purpurea “Sutton’s Apricot” has peachy-apricot flowers along one side of its flower spike, over hairy dark-green leaves. Or, if you are feeling a little bolder, Digitalis “Illumination Pink” – a cross between our native foxglove and the Canary Islands variety – gives a truly tropical sunset in peach and hot pink. It also flowers right into August. For a little less neon, the silvered leaves of Lamium maculatum “Pink Pewter” are good enough alone, but from midsummer onwards, its pale, sugar-pink flowers will entice bees. This is a creeper that will spread and is unfussy about soil type. It won’t mind a little dry shade, too, making it very useful for suppressing weeds. Or if your soil stays a little more damp, the water avens Geum rivale “Leonard’s Variety” has beautiful coppery-pink flowers on reddish-brown stems, and if you keep deadheading it will flower from late spring through to late summer. It won’t survive deep shade, but is perfect for a dappled corner.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Shady characters to light up your garden’s darker corners | Alys Fowler,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/06/shady-flowers-to-light-up-your-gardens-darker-corners
5/6/2022,"Ihad a new anxiety dream the other night. For a few years, inexplicably, my anxiety dreams have been about Ray Davies of the Kinks (you wouldn’t believe the stress of finding him the perfect taupe polo neck before he goes on TV). The other week, though, I had a new one. I imagined a tattoo was sliding down my arm, from my shoulder to my hand, until slipping off completely and leaving a muddy, inky stain on the sheets. I had my first tattoo last October, aged 52: a large, full-colour rendering of a bird – a red kite – on my upper left arm. For years I had been one of those tutting inkphobes who didn’t understand why anyone would mutilate themselves. I would have agreed with a recent article in the Times by Melanie Phillips (paywall) in which she described tattoos as “a kind of desecration, the corruption of something that is pure, precious and the very quintessence of integrity”. Maybe not in those words, perhaps – I’d have just called them ugly – but the thought would have been the same. But something changed in middle age. Call it a midlife crisis, if you want – my sister-in-law calls it a “manopause” – but at least it was cheaper and safer than buying a Ferrari. My wife had been following tattooists on Instagram for a while, because she fancied getting ink herself. She would comment often, and approvingly, on footballers’ arm designs, ignoring the slide-rule pass that put the striker in on goal. And though I had loudly and frequently dismissed tattoos, I had started looking, too, having noticed other people’s – not in any specific way; I had no tattoo role models – and appreciated them, particularly nature-based ones. I saw the beauty in many, though not all – there are lots of tattoos I don’t like, and I promise never to have “Only God Can Judge Me” tattooed on my throat – but enough that I started to wonder how I would look with ink. Something else happened last year, though, without which I wouldn’t have made the step. I lost quite a lot of weight. I am not and will never be svelte; I will always be more comfortable with clothes that have an X on the size label, but at least I can stick to one X these days. I got rid of my belly, and some of my chins; my trousers became dramatically looser and I had to punch new holes in my belts. For the first time, I started to be pleased with the way I looked: I was able to buy nice clothes because nice clothes actually fit me. After the weight loss and the clothes, I wanted to carry on looking different from the schlub I had been, and tattoos seemed the next step. They were not armour, not protection; they were projection. For the middle-aged, tattoos seem not to be whims. They are markers of change, commemorations of events. Rebecca Vincent, whose beautiful floral line drawings have made her something of a superstar in the tattooing world – a waiting list of a year; 171,000 Instagram followers – sees a lot of middle-aged women at her London studio. “I should write a memoir with the stories I’ve heard,” she says. “People open up because they’re in a vulnerable place, and a lot of the time that first tattoo has a significant reason. Sometimes they are flowers to mark a birth; sometimes they mark a loss – a memorial tattoo. When you start getting them, they are so significant, but after two or three tattoos it becomes, ‘Ah, just have another one’.” Sometimes the very insignificance counts. Beverlie Manson, 76, a children’s book illustrator, got her first ink in her 70s, after meeting the heavily tattooed man who would become her third husband. She, too, had not been much of a fan until she saw her husband naked. “The first time he and I got our kit off, I was shocked,” she says. “But it’s so aesthetically interesting.” His tattoos were random – she mentions the words “special fried rice”, in the relevant Chinese script, inked on his leg – and she decided to follow suit, with a line heart on the front of her left shoulder. But don’t read too much into it, she says. She deliberately avoided having something connected to her art (her specialism is drawing fairies). “The idea of having something meaningful didn’t sit well.” Murray Chalmers, a 62-year-old veteran of music PR, started getting inked at 59 (friends enquired if he might regret it when he was older). Two relationships had ended, one after the other; he had moved back home to Scotland, and like me he wanted to mark change in his life. “I had spent a lot of my youth experimenting with clothes and fashion, and they are quite important but they’re ephemeral, they are transient. Tattoos are there for good.” As they did with me, they changed the way he saw himself. “Sometimes I wake up and see my arms and I can’t believe it’s me. The tattoos have become a document joining up different parts of my life. It’s an emotional commitment as well as a physical one.” I’d like to say I carefully researched everything before going under the gun. I didn’t. There’s a tattoo studio called Flamin’ Eight round the corner from my home. I Googled it, and saw Time Out had recommended it as one of London’s best studios. I went in for a consultation with one of their artists, Dale Frame, in October. We went through a selection of photos, from which he would draw a stencil. We discussed placement (good studios are reluctant to give first-timers something that can’t be covered up with clothing) and price, and I was told to have a good breakfast before coming in a couple of weeks later. Dale warned me the first tattoo would hurt. It was large, it was colour, it would take five hours, and it would be painful. To be honest, it really wasn’t – just a little uncomfortable. It turns out – forgive me for simplifying the science – that those of us blessed with ginger hair feel less skin pain than the rest of you. Something to do with pigmentation, but you’re better off asking a dermatologist. I was warned it would itch like hell as it healed (“Remember, a fresh tattoo is an open wound” is not a reassuring sentence). But it didn’t itch either (my wife, who has just had her first tattoo, of ivy tumbling down her shoulder, reports the itching is infernal). A week later I was back for a second tattoo. Then, early this year, for a third and a fourth one, each time with Dale. After the second tattoo, a friend had said: “No one gets two tattoos. They have one, or they don’t stop.” Well, we’ll see how far it goes – I like the symmetry of two on each arm – but having tattoos is an addictive feeling. Not the inking itself, which is neither here nor there to me, but seeing the ink on my skin. Goodness knows it’s not cheap, though, which might be the main barrier to my keeping on. Four tattoos is already into four figures, and I look at people covered in ink and wonder how the hell they could afford it. What I have on my body does not define me, but each piece represents some small part of my world. My first piece was the red kite, with a wingspan of around 20cm. I love red kites: it’s not that they symbolise the freedom to be on the wing, unencumbered by society or anything like that. I just love them and am fascinated by them. The third was a beautiful bare tree – one I walk past on Hampstead Heath several times a week, and had photographed (I had a tiny rendering of my cat put into a hole in the trunk, so she is on my skin for ever) – on my upper right arm. The fourth was four oak leaves, one for each member of our family, on the inside of my lower left arm. The second is the most personal, perhaps, and the hardest to explain without sounding like an idiot. It’s a small black sheep, a detail from the cover of the record Out of Step by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. I am not a huge devotee of hardcore – I like it more than the average, but that’s not hard. Minor Threat are not my favourite band, and Out of Step is not my favourite song of theirs: it’s a defiant yawp of pride about being straight edge (“I don’t drink / Don’t smoke / Don’t fuck / At least I can fucking think!”) and the only time I was straight edge was when abstinence wasn’t a lifestyle choice but the result of being a teenager. What’s more, as a straight, white, middle-aged, middle-class man, I’m about as in step with the world as anyone could be. But I loved Minor Threat’s insane dedication to personal liberation through rock music, and the moments when I feel least trapped by my own self-consciousness have come through rock’n’roll: the times when I dance and sing and talk to strangers and come home much drunker than I really should. That little black sheep represents those moments when I can be the version of myself I enjoy most. I suppose all four tattoos do in some way, but that one matters to me more. What Melanie Phillips didn’t understand is that while, yes, it is nicer if other people like one’s tattoos, that’s absolutely not the point of them. My tattoos make me feel physically confident for the first time in my life. I don’t mean I cowered away from people – I’m 6ft 3in and I know my physical presence is big – but that I was embarrassed by being an overweight, ginger lummox. Tattoos changed that, in a huge and significant way. I do not actually care what other people think of them (my 21-year-old daughter hates them and calls them “those marks on your arms”, which makes me laugh) because they’re not for anyone else. They’re for me. And I love them.

5/6/2022,"A plane crash in the rugged hinterlands of Canada during seemingly calm weather has prompted a federal investigation into what could have brought down the small aircraft. But revelations that two of the passengers were fleeing murder and conspiracy charges and had links to organized crime have only deepened the mystery over the doomed flight. Over the weekend, rescue crews dispatched a search plane and two helicopters to scour the boreal forest of north-western Ontario, after reports of a plane that never arrived at its intended destination. On Saturday, the debris of a small aircraft, a four-seater Piper PA-28 Cherokee, was discovered near the town of Sioux Lookout, guided by the plane’s emergency locator beacon. Neither the pilot, Abhinav Handa, nor the three passengers survived the crash. Among those onboard the plane was Gene Lahrkamp, one of the most wanted men in the country with a C$100,000 (US$78,000) bounty on his head, according to the combined forces special enforcement unit of British Columbia. Lahrkamp, a former soldier was a chief suspect in the murder of gang member Jimi Sandhu, who was shot dead while at a villa in Phuket in February. Sandhu, was born in India but raised in the British Columbia city of Abbotsford, where he joined the United Nations gang. He was deported to India in 2016 by Canadian authorities for “serious criminality”, and arrested there two years later for his role in a ketamine manufacturing operation. Thai police allege that Lahrkamp and co-conspirator Matthew Dupre, another former soldier, travelled to Thailand to kill Sandhu, whose body was found riddled with bullets. Thai police say they dressed in hooded sweatshirts and face coverings for the attack, fleeing for Canada two days after the shooting. Sandhu’s death marks the second recent shooting of a Canadian-linked gang member abroad. In January, two Toronto men linked to the Hells Angels were killed near the resort city of Playa del Carmen in Mexico. Dupre was arrested by Canadian police in late February and is awaiting extradition. An Interpol red notice for Lahrkamp warned he may be armed and dangerous, as well as possibly suicidal. Also onboard the plane was Duncan Bailey, another alleged gang member, who was facing charges of conspiracy to commit murder over a 2020 shooting in Vancouver. An arrest warrant was issued for Bailey in late April after prosecutors in British Columbia say he breached his bail conditions. The fourth person on the plane was identified as Hankun Hong, a resident of British Columbia. It is unclear if he was a co-pilot on the flight or a passenger. Images from his Facebook page show the 27-year-old piloting a small aircraft in western British Columbia. The plane left the province on 23 April, making frequent refuelling stops as it travelled east. The plane departed the town of Dryden, Ontario, on Friday, 29 April evening and was due to land in the town of Marathon, roughly 700 kilometres away. Officials have not yet said if they know where the plane was headed after its stop in Marathon, but the Ontario provincial police say they are conducting a criminal investigation into the flight and the possible links between passengers.",News/World news,Canada plane crash mystery deepens with two murder suspects among dead,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/canada-plane-crash-murder-conspiracy
5/6/2022,"“This is not a record store,” quips Emily Kokal, surveying the crowd. As artists strive to shift copies, in-store album launch shows have become something of an obligation; a short showcase of new wares generally delivered in stripped-back arrangements. Nearly two decades into their career, Warpaint make it clear that they will be doing no such thing. This is an opportunity to really revel in one another’s company, to celebrate their latest release with low-pressure intimacy and warmth. In a room of committed attendees, new cuts are welcomed greedily. They begin with origin song Stars and quickly move on to Champion, the lead single from Radiate Like This (the new album, released today). Cutting through their trademark moody grooves, it has a lovely upbeat glitter, an invitation to embrace your inner cheerleader. Melting is delivered beautifully a capella, small flickers of calypso snaking around the four-part harmony: “No more armour / no anxiety.” There are refreshingly few phones in the air, fans preferring to capture the moment in their loosening limbs. The delight of a Warpaint live show is truly in the detail. All four members seem to untie complex knots from their instruments, working with the spellbinding agility of expert Rubik’s cubers. The rhythm duo of Jenny Lee Lindberg (bass) and Stella Mozgawa (drums) are particularly accomplished, providing the sturdy current beneath Kokal’s and Theresa Wayman’s more experimental vocal/guitar waves. Old favourite Love Is to Die still elicits the biggest cheer but Disco/Very is an aptly named closer, much more dynamic live than it is on record. All good bands can learn to sound polished with time, but the communication in Warpaint feels more instinctual, a sisterly symbiosis that allows each member to shine without diminishing the lustre of the whole. It’s a difficult trick to get right, much less to perform it with this much calm and cool.  Warpaint play Metronome, Nottingham, on 6 May.

The 64-year-old found fame as one half of cooking duo the Hairy Bikers, alongside his friend and fellow chef Si King. Speaking on the Hairy Bikers – Agony Uncles podcast, with 55-year-old King, Myers spoke about his diagnosis. He said: “Anyway Kingy, I’ve got to come clean now, I haven’t been too well recently and, basically, I’ve got to have some chemo, you know all this anyway, so this year is going to be a bit quiet for me, I’m not going to be filming, some of the festivals I’m not going to be able to go to, some may be OK but this year’s a bit of a write-off for us.” He continued by asking listeners to respect his privacy while he undergoes treatment, saying: “I have had to speak up about this because I don’t want to hide under a rock, but I would love it if people respected my privacy and just let me get on with it and give Si and our team all the support they need, that would be great. But look, the prognosis is OK, I’m going to be fine.” He added: “I’ve just got to tuck in, look after myself, eat sensibly and get over this mess, flog books, and be a happy person so, within that, that’s where I am. “I may be a baldy biker for a while so it’s just a warning, I don’t want to make a fuss about it, I look all right bald actually.” Myers did not specify the type of cancer he has. King responded to his friend by saying: “No, listen, when I first met you, dude, you looked like an upside-down Hells Angel so I like that look, I’ve always liked that look, you look cool.” To which Myers replied: “Yeah, I know, and under different circumstances I would embrace it more, I feel, but under these circumstances it’s simply something I have to live with. Get on with it and crack on.” Myers has previously spoken about health struggles, including discovering he had glaucoma – an eye condition that can lead to blindness.
