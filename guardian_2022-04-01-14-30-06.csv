In reality it allows a couple of real duffers to contend for the top prize – Brandi Carlile’s overblown, underwritten Right on Time and Jon Batiste’s excruciatingly corny Freedom – but there is also plenty of superb pop here and any of the list’s second half deserves to win. I think Silk Sonic could pip this – by being alive to the absurd earnestness of baby-making R&B but crucially not parodying it, Leave the Door Open makes you smile in both mirth and joy. It was a vast, cross-generational hit in the US which will appeal to the full breadth of the Academy. Will win: Silk SonicShould win: Silk Sonic Jon Batiste – We AreTony Bennett and Lady Gaga – Love for SaleJustin Bieber – JusticeDoja Cat – Planet HerBillie Eilish – Happier Than EverHER – Back of My MindLil Nas X – MonteroOlivia Rodrigo – SourTaylor Swift – EvermoreKanye West – Donda Batiste is the most nominated artist with 11 nods and We Are’s jack-of-all-trades tour of Black American music is the most Grammy-friendly record imaginable, but his lack of pop-cultural heft means he will probably have to settle for lesser prizes (hopefully film score for Soul, where his kindly jazz songcraft found such a natural home). Evermore is inferior to its sister Folklore, last year’s winner here; Donda was deeply underrated but Kanye’s recent Instagramming has scuppered his chances; HER is widely loved in the Academy but the rather workaday lyricism hampers the solid Back of My Mind. Bieber’s streetwear-Lazarus redemption story will earn some sentimental votes as will Tony Bennett, but neither are likely to get enough. Olivia Rodrigo is the woman of the moment but there are undeniably weak songs in her front-loaded debut, and the abundantly brilliant Doja Cat and Lil Nas X might be too ripe for stuffier voters. So Billie Eilish, so heavily anointed by the Academy, could win a “big four” category for the third year running. Hers is the best album, after all, taking deeply traditional forms (bossa nova, jazz ballads) and casting them into the dumpster fire of digitally mediated life. The result is one of the all-time great pieces of art about the horror of fame – so often a boring subject in songwriting – but whether she’s vampishly making a lover sign an NDA or numbly reciting the ways her body is judged online, Happier Than Ever is gripping.

From the click of the car indicator that opens Drivers License, to the eerie doppler-effect drones, Rodrigo’s debut single conjures the atmosphere of an angrily listless post-heartbreak drive like an audio theatre piece or true crime podcast – and almost no one expresses teenage hurt better than her. Some voters may admire that it’s the work of just two credited songwriters – Rodrigo and producer/co-writer Daniel Nigro – versus the 11 behind Peaches or eight for A Beautiful Noise.

Arlo Parks and Glass Animals do the UK proud in an otherwise weak year for British nominees and the latter have a better chance than most after their vast hit Heat Waves – but really, no one can beat Rodrigo here. Will win: Olivia RodrigoShould win: Baby Keem Justin Bieber – AnyoneBrandi Carlile – Right on TimeBillie Eilish – Happier Than EverAriana Grande – PositionsOlivia Rodrigo – Drivers License Four ballads in this category is a little dismaying, especially as Carlile’s is so rote, though Bieber’s Anyone is actually very good – strongly sung and with the kind of plain lyrics that a solid melody can carry into profundity. Only Ariana Grande’s Positions ups the tempo, and her ode to feminine code-switching is so brilliant. You can, if you wish, detect a sly satiric edge to it; a note of exasperation at women having to keep up Stepford Wives perfection for pampered men. Once again, though, Rodrigo is the one to beat.

Black Pumas’ performance is spirited but it’s an unoriginal, unremarkable song, and their presence at a third consecutive Grammys for a single album of material is dubious. I find the Foo Fighters’ song fussy and far from their best, though a win would in this “performance” category would nicely acknowledge the brio and showmanship of the late Taylor Hawkins; the late Chris Cornell covering Nothing Compares 2 U is a great idea on paper but he can’t shake a certain other rather famous cover of it; and Deftones’ Ohms can only grasp at coherence. But while AC/DC’s blues-rock’n’roll is generic in every way, that is its charm – it conjures the feel of a saloon full of sloshed, horny middle-aged bikers so strongly you can almost smell the creaking leathers. Will win: AC/DCShould win: AC/DC Baby Keem – Family Ties (feat Kendrick Lamar)Cardi B – UpJ Cole – My Life (feat 21 Savage & Morray)Megan Thee Stallion – Thot Shit After Drake removed his Way 2 Sexy from competition, two rap styles face off against each other. The boys furrow their brows as they use knotty, triplet-time flows to fret about fame and fuss around complex beats; the girls use simple, speaker-booming club production to showboat their considerable prowess precisely on top of the beat. All four tracks are excellent in their own way, and perhaps Baby Keem – who seems to inspire a new angry-avuncular vocal style in his mentor Lamar – can triumph here if he doesn’t win best new artist. For me, Cardi deserves the crown. Up is a blast of pure entertainment, from the immortal insult “breath smell like horse sex” to a chorus – “Big bag bussin’ out the Bentley Bentayga” – that fires out her favoured consonant in a spittle-drenching, supremely satisfying tongue twister.

Stapleton’s song is about resisting having sex with someone you shouldn’t, and, as if by design, is so dull that you could play it to snuff out any inappropriate lust. Musgraves nicely pinpoints a modern breakup problem – how do you avoid the photos of your ex in your phone? – but the song is as listless as a doomscroll, and Isbell doesn’t bring anything new to his Johnny Cash cover. That leaves Mickey Guyton, who became the first black woman to be nominated in this category last year, and whose feather-to-granite vocal versatility somewhat individualises a song best suited to sporting montages. And there’s Luke Combs’s Forever After All, a first-wedding-dance hit that reached No 2 in the US – lofty heights indeed for country songs today. It’s cliched and cheesy, mentioning both beer and trucks in the opening two lines, but is also wonderfully sturdy, and continues the proud country tradition of being a safe space for “real men” listeners to tap into their latent soppiness.

4/1/2022,"Peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv will resume on Friday, amid fresh efforts to help residents in Mariupol flee the besieged, devastated city. Ukrainian negotiator, David Arakhamia, said on Thursday that talks would continue by video, focusing on the peace framework Kyiv presented during a face-to-face meeting in Istanbul this week that Moscow described as constructive. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, further upped the diplomatic stakes amid the negotiations, signing a decree requiring foreign buyers to pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday or see their energy contracts halted – a demand Germany, France and the UK instantly rejected and that Berlin described as blackmail. A humanitarian corridor is set to be opened from 10am on Friday to allow civilians out of the besieged port city of Mariupol, and a convoy of 45 Ukrainian buses has set out to try to deliver humanitarian supplies and bring out trapped civilians, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. The convoy was expected to enter the city on Friday morning after Russian promises of a limited ceasefire along the route from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. The move follows “a personal request from the French president and German chancellor to Russian president Vladimir Putin”, said Russia’s defence ministry. Repeated efforts to set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of up to 170,000 people who remain in Mariupol, which has suffered four weeks of bombardment and dwindling supplies, have failed. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of shelling supposedly safe routes outside of several fighting hotspots, claims that Moscow denies. On Thursday night, Volodymyr Zelenskiy repeated his warning that Russia was preparing for “powerful strikes” in the Donbas region after appearing to withdraw from an assault on Kyiv. He dismissed the withdrawal of Russian forces near Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy as tactical. The Pentagon also said that Russia may be repositioning some of its forces to send them to the Donbas. The UK’s ministry of defence said Russia was pulling forces out of Georgia to reinforce its invasion of Ukraine in a move it said was unplanned and “indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion”. Both the US and UK have suggested Putin is becoming increasingly frustrated, with US president Joe Biden saying Putin “seems to be self-isolated” and noted “there’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,” without citing evidence. White House director of communications Kate Bedingfield said the war had been a “strategic disaster” for Russia and that it was “working to re-define the initial aims of their invasion”. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said Putin was “not the force he used to be” and was “now a man in a cage he built himself”. Despite the ongoing talks, there is mounting western scepticism about Russia’s intentions in the talks, more than five weeks into its invasion of Ukraine. There has been no real sign of the partial military pullback in northern Ukraine it had promised as a goodwill gesture, suggesting the Kremlin may be playing for time. Kyiv’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, has insisted, however, that the Kremlin was considering Ukraine’s proposals, which included an international treaty under which Ukraine would remain neutral, with its security guaranteed by third countries. In other developments: The UN atomic watchdog is investigating Ukrainian claims that Russian soldiers occupying Chernobyl nuclear power station left after receiving high doses of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it could not confirm the claims by Ukrainian state power company Energoatom and was seeking an independent assessment. Australia is to send Bushmaster armoured vehicles to Ukraine following an address to MPs by Zelenskiy. Prime minister Scott Morrison said: “We will send our armoured vehicles, Bushmasters ... and we will fly them over in our C-17s [aircraft] to make sure they can be there to support [Ukraine].” Morrison suggested more aid would follow. EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions.

4/1/2022,"Hundreds of adults and children with type 1 diabetes in England have been fitted with an artificial pancreas that experts say could become the “holy grail” for managing the disease, in a world-first trial on the NHS. The groundbreaking device uses an algorithm to determine the amount of insulin that should be administered and reads blood sugar levels to keep them steady. The NHS trial has so far found the technology more effective at managing diabetes than current devices and that it requires far less input from patients. Managing type 1 diabetes can be challenging, especially in young children, owing to variations in the levels of insulin required and unpredictability around how much patients eat and exercise. Children are particularly at risk of dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) and high ones (hyperglycaemia), which can damage the body or even lead to death. Now a new artificial pancreas worn next to the body – which continually monitors blood glucose levels and automatically adjusts insulin delivered via a pump – is being tested in 30 NHS diabetes centres. About 875 people have benefited so far in the first nationwide study of its kind in the world. The technology can eliminate finger-prick tests to check blood sugar levels and prevent hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemia attacks. Although most of the NHS’s estimated £10bn annual spending on diabetes treatment goes on type 2 diabetes, it is also hoped the devices will help cut costs by ensuring less need for interventions for type 1 cases. “Having machines monitor and deliver medication for diabetes patients sounds quite sci-fi-like, but when you think of it, technology and machines are part and parcel of how we live our lives every day,” said Prof Partha Kar, the NHS national speciality adviser for diabetes. “A device picks up your glucose levels, sends the reading across to the delivery system – AKA the pump – and then the system kicks in to assess how much insulin is needed. It is not very far away from the holy grail of a fully automated system, where people with type 1 diabetes can get on with their lives without worrying about glucose levels or medication.” Charlotte Abbott-Pierce, six, was diagnosed just over a year ago and initially started on insulin injections but has now become one of the first people to benefit from an artificial pancreas. She has been fitted with an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor that, as part of the world first pilot, now work together. Her mother, Ange Abbott-Pierce, said: “Before the hybrid closed loop system was fitted, my husband and I would be up every two hours every night having to check Charlotte’s blood sugars and most times giving insulin, sometimes doing finger pricks or dealing with ketones due to quick rises in blood sugar.” She said the new system was a “godsend to us as we were at our wits’ end with worry, not being able to catch the highs before they got dangerous”. Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “This technology has the potential to transform the lives of people with type 1 diabetes, improving both their quality of life and clinical outcomes.” The data collected from the pilot, along with other evidence, will be considered by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence when it looks at rolling the device out more widely. Separately, new research on Friday reveals that even slim people can get remission from type 2 diabetes by managing their calorie intake. A trial led by Prof Roy Taylor of Newcastle University found 70% of participants with a low body mass index (BMI) went into type 2 remission thanks to diet-controlled weight loss, despite not being obese or overweight. Obesity raises the risk of type 2 diabetes, but 10% of sufferers have lower BMIs. His previous landmark research gave hope to millions of type 2 diabetics who were overweight by showing it was possible to go into remission through careful weight loss. It showed that shedding fat from inside the pancreas and liver – the two key organs involved in blood sugar control – was key to remission from type 2 in people living with obesity or being overweight. Now researchers have found it also works for slimmer diabetics – with a BMI at or just above the healthy range, below 27. Taylor said: “This is very good news for everyone with type 2 diabetes.”",News/Society,Hundreds fitted with artificial pancreas in NHS type 1 diabetes trial,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/01/hundreds-fitted-with-artificial-pancreas-in-nhs-type-1-diabetes-trial
4/1/2022,"MPs are to examine why ministers delayed paying a debt to Iran even though they knew the payment was likely to lead to the release of two British-Iranian detainees. The foreign affairs select committee formally confirmed it was launching an inquiry adding that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori deserved the truth. Both were released a fortnight ago and returned to the UK from Iran after payment of the £400m debt on the understanding the money was used for humanitarian purposes. The committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, said: “After years of imprisonment in extremely difficult circumstances Nazanin and Anoosheh are right to ask for answers.” The pair had been held for almost six years and more than four years respectively in Iran. The Middle East minister, Alistair Burt, has already written to the committee saying he had contacts with Iranian ministers who repeatedly told him that the UK refusal to pay the debt was making the dual nationals’ release more difficult to secure. He said he argued inside the government that the £400m sum was not a ransom, but an internationally acknowledged debt. The debt arose out of an upfront payment in 1971 to the UK by the Iranian government under the Shah of Iran for more than 1,700 Chieftain tanks. Only 175 of the tanks were delivered by the UK despite receiving the Iranian money due to the takeover of Iran by a revolutionary regime in 1979. Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP representing Zaghari-Ratcliffe, had called for the select committee inquiry into the Foreign Office handling of the issue. She said: “I know that the Foreign Office cannot reasonably be held responsible for the arbitrary detention of its nationals abroad, but it also cannot escape scrutiny and challenge for its clear shortcomings in trying to secure their release – particularly from Iran. Other countries including Australia, France, Germany, Canada and the US have had greater success in securing the fair treatment and release of prisoners held for leverage on false charges. “The husband of Nazanin, Richard, and I have known since the start that Nazanin’s imprisonment was linked to the historic debt we owed to Iran, yet it was only after many years of pressure that this was finally resolved. While in Iran, Nazanin was blindfolded, handcuffed, interrogated and subjected to solitary confinement, sleep deprivation and torture. The government has serious questions to answer about why this was allowed to happen to an innocent British citizen, who was caught as a pawn in a political dispute between two countries. “The inquiry should look at why the deal that the UK and Iran supposedly made in 2021 to resolve the debt and bring Nazanin home collapsed.”",News/News,MPs to examine why UK delayed Iran payment that freed detainees,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/01/mps-to-examine-why-uk-delayed-iran-payment-that-freed-detainees

4/1/2022,"Young LGBTQ+ people in the UK are facing a “hidden epidemic” of abuse by close family members based on their sexuality or gender identity, according to a study. Nearly one in three LGBTQ+ people have experienced abuse – ranging from verbal harassment to threats of homelessness and physical violence – by a relative, most often their own parents, with two-thirds of them aged under 18 when the abuse first occurred, research for the anti-abuse charity Galop found. The report, seen by the Guardian, aims “to shine a light on abuse happening to LGBTQ+ people behind closed doors in the UK” as well as highlight the potential barriers survivors face when seeking help. Leni Morris, the charity’s CEO, said: “When someone suffers abuse which targets them for who they fundamentally are, especially at such a formative age and at the hands of such an influential person, the repercussions are often lifelong. This report echoes the severity and complexity of cases we are supporting at Galop, often within which victims have never told anyone about their experience.” The survey of more than 5,000 LGBTQ+ people, conducted in February by YouGov, also reveals:  Transgender and non-binary people surveyed experienced higher levels of abuse from family members (43%).  5% of LGBTQ+ respondents reported being subjected to conversion practices, with a family member attempting to change, “cure” or suppress their sexual orientation or gender identity, increasing to 11% of trans and non-binary respondents.  60% of respondents who had experienced abuse from their family felt their LGBTQ+ identity was either the main reason or part of the reason.  63% of LGBTQ+ people surveyed were under 18 when they first experienced abuse from their family, and 30% were below the age of 11. Respondents described instances of regular humiliation by relatives, having their interactions with friends monitored, being outed by a sibling or thrown out of the family home and banned from visiting, as well as longer-term impacts on their capacity to build close relationships or feel comfortable with their sexuality. As a result of the findings, Galop is recommending long-term dedicated funding for specialist “by and for” services to support LGBTQ+ survivors of abuse, and for police, other agencies and support services to improve their understanding of family abuse. Morris added: “Anti-LGBTQ+ abuse from family members is often misinterpreted by statutory services as ‘generational differences’ or having ‘different values’ rather than seeing it for what it really is – domestic abuse. This leads to many LGBTQ+ people not having access to the support and help that they need in order to safely leave these abusive situations. “LGBTQ+ people who try to escape abuse don’t have enough suitable accommodation in the UK to meet their needs. We regularly see LGBTQ+ victims of abuse and violence forced to choose between potentially dangerous emergency accommodation, homelessness, or staying with their abusers.”  In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

Smart plays Deborah Vance, a battle-hardened veteran of the standup comedy scene who now lives in Las Vegas. Vance is playing 100 shows a year at the Palmetto casino in between flogging tat and her guts out on a shopping channel, doing paid daytime events and never, ever letting down the fans who still adore her, even if they follow in smaller droves than they once did. Then it’s home to a magnificent mansion and her beloved dogs, and time to take the wig and makeup off before having dinner alone. There are clear parallels with Joan Rivers here, whose life was also one of constant hustle and glamorous graft (and, famously, beloved dogs and a jewellery line on QVC). But there is never any sense of the snotty mockery with which Rivers, especially in later life, was frequently treated. It’s the greatest triumph of Hacks – which has many – that Deborah exists in the round and her work, life, legacy and flaws are never treated with anything other than respect by her creators. Which is not to say that fun is never poked at all of them by other characters – that being pretty much the definition of writerly respect. Despite the constant hustle, however, Deborah’s star is on the wane and Marty, the owner of the Palmetto and as close a thing to a friend as Deborah has, wants to hand her Friday and Saturday slots over to a reality show winner who is now big box office. To buy her time to negotiate, Deborah’s manager Jimmy (Paul W Downs) sends one of his younger clients over to help her produce fresher, more relevant material – in the faint hope that the partnership will work out. TV comedy writer Ava (Hannah Einbinder, doing a fair job of going toe-to-toe with Smart) has been unemployed since tweeting a joke about a closeted senator and his gay son. There are few false notes in Hacks but, when we hear the joke, it is one of them – it doesn’t punch down and doesn’t sound like anything that would have caused sufficient furore to make Ava unhirable across town, even in a bastion of integrity such as LA. After a rocky start, the pair accept each other’s presence and the rest of the series follows the gradual – and it is pleasingly slow, non-linear and credible – evolution of their relationship from reluctant professional assignation to cautious and eventually moving friendship. They are both prickly, both assured of their talent and essential rightness in all things comic (and, for Deborah, everything else, too), as well as being in need of change. We can see how much Ava could learn from a woman who has seen it all, done most of it and knows what it takes to overcome the relentless hostility of the world – and particularly the men in it. And we can see how much Deborah needs to shed some of the diva attitude she has accrued over the years and admit that a new perspective needn’t mean the destruction of all that she has created. There are plenty of laughs along the way, but it’s the unforced emotional truths that make Hacks a right and proper vehicle for Smart. She has long been the go-to for any casting director looking for a tough broad, and now she gets to play all the notes that sang underneath.",Arts/Television & radio,Hacks review – a laugh-packed comedy drama that restores your belief in the justice of the universe,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/01/hacks-review-a-laugh-packed-comedy-drama-that-restores-your-belief-in-the-justice-of-the-universe
4/1/2022,"A keen appetite for curry has landed six members of Japan’s maritime self-defence forces (SDF) in trouble, after it emerged that they had been tucking into the dish without paying for up to three years. The SDF members, including an officer in his 50s, helped themselves to free curry at Hachinohe air base in north-east Japan, apparently ignoring rules requiring them to pay, according to Japanese media reports. The dish is gratis for personnel living in barracks or stationed on board ships docked at the base, Sora News 24 reported. But the officer and his five colleagues did not belong to either group and should have paid for their meals. The officer, who has not been named, did not pay for a single one of his Friday lunchtime curries between July 2017 and March 2020, while others had helped themselves free of charge for two to three years since 2012, the Yomiuri Shimbun said. The officer reportedly attempted to justify his transgression, telling SDF investigators: “People have been doing what they call ‘tasting’ since before I was posted to this base. I didn’t think it was a serious breach of regulations.” A military tribunal did not agree, however, and this week suspended him from duty for five days. His fellow curry enthusiasts also received short suspensions. Japan’s maritime SDF is proud of its connection to curry, which personnel eat every Friday. Packs of boil-in-the-bag “navy curry” are popular souvenirs and some appear on supermarket shelves. Sailors in the imperial navy reportedly acquired a taste for the dish thanks to Anglo-Indian officers in the Royal Navy who brought curry powder to Japan after the country was forced to end almost three centuries of seclusion in the mid-1800s. The earliest recipes appeared in Japanese cookbooks in 1872, and its modern-day incarnation, karē raisu (curry rice), is wildly popular among schoolchildren. And ravenous naval officers.",News/World news,Taste for free curry leaves Japanese defence force members in a pickle,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/taste-for-free-curry-leaves-japanese-defence-force-members-in-a-pickle
4/1/2022,"The Morrison government has axed a $1.3bn program to buy armed drones, redirecting the money towards the “Redspice” cybersecurity package that the Coalition trumpeted as a centrepiece of the defence budget. As political parties prepare for the possibility of the election campaign formally beginning within days, officials revealed the government was cancelling a project it previously hailed as a “cutting-edge armed remotely-piloted aircraft system”. The government also confirmed it was yet to decide on the future of a Chinese company’s lease over the Port of Darwin, describing last year’s review as a “live process” that was not yet complete. The Coalition is known to be keen to campaign on its national security credentials and it used Tuesday’s budget to promote what it called “the biggest ever investment in Australia’s cyber preparedness”. Australia’s electronic spy agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, will double in size and ramp up its ability to launch its own offensive cyber operations as part of a $10bn pledge dubbed Redspice, short for “resilience, effects, defence, space, intelligence, cyber and enablers”. But the funding is spread over 10 years and only $4.2bn will be spent in the first four-year budget cycle. Given the government is partly offsetting the package with savings from other parts of the defence portfolio, the cyber pledge is worth only $588.7m in new money in the first four years. Defence officials confirmed at a Senate estimates hearing on Friday that the Redspice-related savings included cancelling the SkyGuardian program, under which Australia had planned to acquire up to 12 armed drones which could also be used for surveillance. The government had previously said it would try to maximise Australian industry content in that acquisition. The then defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said in 2019: “Cutting-edge technology of this kind, with advanced sensors and systems, would complement advanced aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and ensure that Australian Defence Force maintains state-of-the-art capability.” So far, just $10m has been spent on the envisaged $1.3bn SkyGuardian program. The acting secretary of the Department of Defence, Matt Yannopoulos, said the cancellation of the program was made “by government as part of the decision for Redspice”. Asked whether the cancellation had been previously announced, Yannopoulos said: “No, I did that here – 20 minutes ago.” Pressed on why it was only revealed during Senate estimates, he added: “To answer a direct question from Senator [Penny] Wong on what was adjusted in the integrated investment program to support Redspice.” Officials said there were also some cost offsets from within the ASD’s own programs. Labor said the cancellation would “reverberate around Australian defence industry” and “demonstrates this government doesn’t care about Australian manufacturing”. Labor’s defence spokesperson, Brendan O’Connor, said: “How on earth can Australians trust this government to deliver what they promise when they hide unpopular decisions?” O’Connor also claimed that “up to $5.5bn will be wasted on a non-existent fleet of submarines”. On Friday, defence officials were unable to shed light on the likely costs of cancelling the French submarine contract, but said they expected it would be able to be covered within existing budgeted amounts. Defence budget papers say $5.4bn is the total approved project expenditure for the Future Submarine Mobilisation and Design. That includes estimated total spending up to 30 June 2022 of $3.2bn and a further $494m in the 2022-23 financial year. Officials told Friday’s hearing that the attack-class submarine program had so far cost $2.5bn, up to the end of January 2022. But they said the figures for the program outlined in Tuesday’s budget were as originally earmarked – prior to the cancellation – because “we haven’t determined what the final cost is”. Talks with the French company Naval Group are continuing. The Senate hearing also scrutinised the government’s plans for new port infrastructure in the Northern Territory, amid speculation the Coalition may campaign on the matter during the election. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said on budget night that the government would invest “$1.5bn to build new port infrastructure, such as a wharf, an offloading facility and dredging of the shipping channel, to boost the region’s importing and exporting ability”. Defence officials confirmed they have been in talks with counterparts from the infrastructure department, but noted that the Northern Territory had been promoting plans for the trade-focused “Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct” for some time. The Northern Territory’s then-Country Liberal party government granted a 99-year lease over the Port of Darwin to the Chinese company Landbridge Group, under a controversial 2015 agreement. The federal government announced a review on national security grounds last year. The Australian newspaper reported in late December that Defence’s review had found there were no national security grounds sufficient to recommend a government intervention to overturn the controversial lease. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, said on Friday: “I have no information on the genesis of that media speculation. I have information and advice which indicates to me that the review is still in process. So I would say that the speculation is incorrect.” The article in the Australian had noted the government was still reviewing the matter, but speculated that the position of the Department of Defence “makes any decision to overturn the port lease more politically challenging”. Peter Tesch, a deputy secretary of the Department of Defence, told the hearing his agency had “considered the implications for defence” and provided its judgment, “but the process is not entirely within the remit of Defence”. He said other agencies and departments were also involved and it was still “a live process”. Guardian Australia has previously reported the government was considering options that went beyond the binary choice of keeping or scrapping the lease. That could include imposing additional requirements on the operator, Landbridge Group, under critical infrastructure laws. Landbridge said last year the company had “acquired the lease to Darwin Port in good faith following a transparent process in 2015” and was willing to assist any review.",News/Australia news,Coalition axes $1.3bn armed drone program and redirects funds to cybersecurity,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/coalition-axes-13bn-armed-drone-program-and-redirects-funds-to-cybersecurity
4/1/2022,"Barely a breath of wind this morning, but the branches of an alder overhanging the riverbank are shaking. Siskins are feeding on seeds from its small woody cones. The birds are easily spooked but, as I sit motionless under the tree, they move closer. Soon they are just a few feet away – lively, lithe little finches, black and lime green with mottled streaks on their underside. Marvellously acrobatic, stretching, dangling, twisting this way and that to reach their reward. Never still for a second, endlessly probing with beaks that taper to a point as fine as jewellers’ tweezers, adapted for extracting the tiny woody seeds between the cone scales. They are quiet, preoccupied with feeding on their own cluster of cones, so different in behaviour from the feisty siskins that have been feasting on our garden bird table all winter. Those are mutually aggressive and constantly challenge greenfinches and tree sparrows for a perch on the feeder containing sunflower kernels. Sometimes violent conflict breaks out. They are so different in demeanour that they could almost be a different species. Perhaps that is what providing limitless luxury food in a single location does to bird behaviour: it promotes competition and conflict. A siskin needs to collect about 10,000 alder seeds to match its body weight. It must spend most of the daylight hours feeding on its natural food source but can gain the same nutritional benefit in an hour by monopolising a prime position on the sunflower seed feeder. The birds in the tree in front of me now are closer than ever. For every seed they consume, many more fall on to the muddy strandline of the retreating river. Thousands of alders in this valley produce an abundance of seeds all through winter, each tree bearing more seeds than siskins ever consume. Next winter’s crop is already in its infancy: this spring’s tiny purple cones are already beginning to swell. Another turn in the cycle of seasons. Siskins and their preferred food source are well matched, but the promise of easy street on garden bird tables reveals an aggressive nature less often seen in the wild.

4/1/2022,"Did you hear about Melbourne’s latest tourist attraction? The lord mayor, Sally Capp, has announced a massive winter water slide that will operate in the city’s CBD, depositing thrill seekers into the murky Yarra River. And after a big day of water sports, kick back and watch one of the many new Australian shows airing on streaming service Amazon Prime. These include the new reality series, The Real Parking Inspectors of Inner Sydney. It’s a drama-filled look at the lives and loves of a group of competitive ticket-bandits who wander city streets. With a glut of April Fools’ jokes testing the gullibility of Australians, Guardian Australia has wrapped up the best and worst of the yearly pranks. Following the success of the Zipline across the Yarra during Summer we’re thrilled to announce our latest attraction to bring people into the city - a waterslide into the Yarra for Winter!

Also greenlit is a musical about Australia’s favourite bird, the white ibis, called Bin Bandits. But the ratings hit will be Real Parking Inspectors of Inner Sydney. The docusoap follows the lives and loves of a group of inspectors, battling to stay on top in the cutthroat world of Sydney parking. Animal jokes never get old Worried about the climate crisis? Fuel prices? Well so are Victoria police. They’ve come up with a solution to reduce their carbon footprint, reduce costs, and overcome the “humps in every day policing”. They’re expanding their mounted operations with a new caravan of camels. “The new unit will be staffed entirely by wild rescue camels,” said East West Specialist Operations Inspector Bactrian Camelus said in a Facebook post. “Unlike much of Australia, Victoria doesn’t currently have an issue with introduced camels, so by bringing them here and providing them with a meaningful role within the community we are doing a favour to our interstate peers.” In other animal news, the Australian Reptile Park has posted a picture of Elvis the Saltwater crocodile frolicking in the waves off the Central Coast at Terrigal Beach.
