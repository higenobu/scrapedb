4/16/2022,"Olli Harder believes familiarity will offer his West Ham players invaluable reassurance as they meet renascent Manchester City for the third time this season. Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final takes place at Dagenham & Redbridge’s Chigwell Construction Stadium, where Harder’s side play their home games. “If you’ve climbed a mountain before, the idea of doing it again becomes easier psychologically,” said Harder. “We’ve beaten City before, we know where we can hurt them and they know that as well.” Although only a fortnight ago West Ham lost 2-0 at home to Gareth Taylor’s team in the Women’s Super League, Harder choreographed victory by the same scoreline in Manchester last October. “City are talented but there’s a lot to be optimistic about,” said the New Zealander. “We’re hoping to write a fantastic story about an underdog reaching the FA Cup final. It’s about seizing counterattacking opportunities and being more clinical than two weeks ago. If we can do that, defend for our lives and show the West Ham spirit anything’s possible.” Tactics, talent and sheer tenacity will all play their part in determining who reaches Wembley, but emotional control also seems set to exert a key role. At the end of a week in which the Northern Ireland women’s manager, Kenny Shiels, contentiously asserted that “emotional” female footballers are susceptible to conceding several goals in swift succession, gender differences dominated conversation before the semi-final. After his side’s 5-0 defeat by England in Belfast on Tuesday Shiels posited the thesis that “women are more emotional than men … so they don’t take a goal going in very well”. On Wednesday he apologised amid a furore, and, by Thursday, Northern Ireland’s players had issued a collective statement saying “we stand by our manager”. Harder and Taylor were braced for questions on the issue. “I’m sure there’s context behind those comments,” said Harder, whose seventh-placed side sit three places and 11 points behind City in the WSL. “Research shows there are more clusters of goals in women’s football but I’ve no idea why. “I think men hide their emotions a lot better than women but all humans are emotional. Any time there’s a disappointment there’s going to be an emotional context. I don’t think it’s necessarily a case of women having more emotions than men.” Taylor proved similarly nuanced. “I know Kenny, he was working at Tranmere when I was a player there and he’s a good guy,” said City’s manager. “I think he was probably just talking a little emotionally himself. His quite-early apology was important and the right thing to do. “But the situation he was talking about happens in football, regardless of gender. It’s an emotional game, players make mistakes, do good things, lack confidence. It doesn’t matter whether you’re male or female, it’s a passionate game.” Taylor, a former City and Wales striker, coached boys’ teams in the club’s academy before crossing the Etihad Stadium Campus to take charge of the senior women. “There’s some subtle differences [between the genders in football],” he said. “What blew me away most is that the girls will do the most boring technical stuff ever, like their lives depend on it. I think that’s amazing – as is the application and effort of women’s teams. “There’s many times we’ve been 4-0 or 5-0 up late on in games and the opposition just don’t stop. They still come out and engage. You’ve got to take your hat off. It just doesn’t happen in the men’s game. By that stage in a men’s team the opposition are on their holidays and you’ve earned the right to control the game and do less work. But women’s teams don’t let up at all.” Similar resilience has served his side well in a season which started dismally but is ending brightly. Debilitated by a raft of injuries to key personnel including England’s Lucy Bronze and Ellie Roebuck, City struggled badly last autumn but are now strong contenders for Champions League qualification. A once-powerful clamour for Taylor’s sacking has long since evaporated. “I think if, in some really difficult moments earlier this season, anyone had offered us the position we’re in now we’d have taken it,” said a manager debating whether to hand Chloe Kelly her first start of the season after the England winger’s recovery from a serious knee injury sustained last May. “We’re going in the right direction but I’m expecting some tactical cat-and-mouse at West Ham. There’s going to be times in the semi-final where we suffer.”",Sport/Football,Olli Harder invokes ‘West Ham spirit’ before Manchester City FA Cup clash,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/olli-harder-west-ham-manchester-city-womens-fa-cup
4/16/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has said he wants Conor Gallagher in his Chelsea squad next season and apologised to the midfielder during an impromptu restaurant meeting for his Crystal Palace loan making him ineligible to face his parent club in Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final. Gallagher has been a revelation for Palace but will be forced to watch from the sidelines at Wembley. Palace made a request for the 22-year-old to be allowed to play but the rules of the loan will prevent him from lining up against last season’s Cup finalists. Tuchel said: “I believe Conor can be a part of our squad and can play a role with us. But I am not the only one to decide. We need to speak after the season with everybody, speak after the season about what Conor wants, we need to see what the situation is and what role we have for him that he can fight for. “There needs to be something to fight, a role and perspective of where you are, where you can be, what you need to achieve. So we have to be very clear with him and he needs to be clear with us. Then we will sort it out. His development is extraordinary and outstanding. “He is one of the key players at Crystal Palace and made a huge step in his development up front. He was a pleasure to coach in pre-season – he has so much positive energy, energy in general, and such work rate to give that he can have a big influence.” Gallagher has scored eight goals this season and provided five assists, with the attacking midfielder helping Palace climb into the top half of the Premier League and reach the semi-final. The Chelsea academy graduate’s form resulted in his England debut in November and he made his first international start in last month’s friendly win against Switzerland. Tuchel bumped into Gallagher recently and the Chelsea manager understood the midfielder’s frustration at being denied the opportunity to make an impression at Wembley. “I had the chance to speak to Conor, and I could also see his frustration,” Tuchel said. “We met some weeks ago; after the international break by coincidence we ran into each other in a restaurant, and we had a chat. The subject came up, and I apologised because I know how competitive he is and I like him a lot. “I know his character very well … This is the way it is. We play to win the game, and the rules were clear when we made the loan. I can totally understand Patrick Vieira and the disappointment of Conor but these are the rules when we did the loan, and we don’t want to suffer from our rules.” Chelsea will have Romelu Lukaku available with the striker returning to training after missing the games at Southampton and Real Madrid.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel wants Conor Gallagher to be part of Chelsea squad next season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/thomas-tuchel-conor-gallagher-chelsea-crystal-palace
4/16/2022,"Jürgen Klopp claimed six and a half years at Liverpool had aged him, and that was before he became the Premier League’s longest-serving manager after Sean Dyche’s sacking on Friday. The intensity of a job that will be shaped by the finest margins over the coming weeks is the culprit but, far from hastening the end, this is what exhilarates him. With one domestic trophy in the bag Liverpool turn their attentions to another on Saturday when returning to Wembley to renew acquaintances with Manchester City in an FA Cup semi-final. Thoughts will then turn to a Premier League title race separated by one point, with Manchester United and Everton visiting Anfield next week, before Villarreal arrive in the Champions League semi-final. There is the odd complaint from Klopp – a 12.30pm kick-off scheduled at Newcastle between the Villarreal ties currently chief among them – but if this is a time that weathers the skin it also works wonders within. It could be a good moment for FSG to dangle a contract extension in front of him. “Only recently I saw a picture of me in 2005,” said Klopp on Thursday, his FA Cup press conference brought forward 24 hours because Liverpool do not conduct usual media duties on the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. “I saw a picture of when I arrived here too [in October 2015]. Unfortunately I see myself in the mirror every morning so the last six years have been pretty intense. I see a different person now. “Chelsea have had exactly the same programme as us recently, with the same amount of games because of the League Cup final, and Thomas [Tuchel] said it perfectly: it is really super-intense. But it’s good fun as well. I would love to have a full week to train. My God! Give me a full week of training in the middle of the season. But we don’t have it, and that is why we make changes.” “It is always intense. This year is especially intense but it is also enjoyable and exciting. Is it likely that we win the four competitions? No. Three competitions? No. One more? Hopefully, that would be nice. Pep [Guardiola] said it: if Atlético scores a goal then we don’t talk about the great mentality of the City players, and it was a great mentality. That is the difference. We draw at City or maybe we lose 3-2 and everyone says that is not good enough. That’s OK. It is our life. These small things are really important and make all the difference and being ready for that all the time is really difficult, but it is very interesting.” Klopp is the first manager in Liverpool’s rich history to reach three semi-finals in a season. The achievement, of course, brings only a little satisfaction to someone who could soon become the first manager in English football to win a quadruple. “Three semi-finals and winning nothing, the world is not ready for this kind of success,” he remarks, glossing over victory in the Carabao Cup. “But, no, I’m really happy for the boys. At this club it is so difficult to do something that our fathers and grandfathers didn’t do already. This specific thing, nobody did it in this club so it is really special. But if that is the success this year, it will not be seen as success in the future.” Liverpool should be relatively refreshed compared with City who, while Klopp made seven changes against Benfica on Wednesday, endured a bruising night at Atlético. Mohamed Salah was among those given much-needed rest – for 57 minutes at least – and Klopp believes the forward is primed to finish with a flourish despite scoring once in his past 11 games for club and country. “The problem we have is that in January he had the most intense period in his whole career,” he said. “The [Africa Cup of Nations] tournament went to the wire. Egypt played in the final, they had all these 120 minutes, the role he has is super, super massive. There is a huge responsibility on his shoulders with dressing-room meetings and no recovery at all. Then you have the issue of being a superstar in your own country and everyone wants something from you. It is all super intense. “A player like Mo who likes to dribble – and he is really good, he scored outstanding goals with dribbling – do I say to him, ‘Don’t dribble?’ No. It is, ‘Dribble in the right moments and keep the ball, keep it simple,’ all these kind of things. I know that Mo will finish strong. It’s just at the moment we have to reset because each game for us is a final. It has been like that from the beginning of January, and that is crazy.”",Sport/Football,‘I see a different person now’: Jürgen Klopp on his long road at Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-fa-cup-manchester-city
