1/18/2022,"In France the 400th anniversary of Molière’s birth is being celebrated in a big way. In Britain it has been greeted with a deafening silence. But then we have always been slightly wary of Molière. It is partly that we lack the histrionic tradition that led CE Montague to write that watching French actors play Molière was “like turning over a portfolio of old and choice theatrical prints”. It is also the difficulty of translation: I can think of a handful of good ones – including Tony Harrison’s The Misanthrope, Christopher Hampton’s Don Juan and Ranjit Bolt’s The School for Wives – but many that are rough without being ready. We seem much happier doing adaptations and one play that comes up repeatedly is Tartuffe. It is not hard to see why: hypocrisy, especially if it is religious, is always with us. Even Shakespeare jokes about it in Twelfth Night when Feste, donning a curate’s robe, says: “I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown.” But Molière’s Tartuffe is much the greatest play on the subject and has prompted any number of transpositions: the two best I have seen both made use, in radically different ways, of Asian culture.  Jatinder Verma, founder of Tara Arts, did a remarkable National Theatre mobile production back in 1990. Verma discovered that in 1667, just after Molière wrote the first version of Tartuffe, a French traveller, François Bernier, was in India and was struck by the omnipresence of wandering holy men known as fakirs. “Heaven help the family,” wrote Bernier, “that does not give them a good welcome even though everyone knows they have eyes only for the women of the family.” Since Molière’s Tartuffe uses his religiosity to conquer Orgon’s wife, house and wealth, that gave Verma the cue for an Indian Tartuffe. The result wittily reminded us that Molière’s work was anchored in popular tradition with Verma deploying Kathak dance and Khayal music. But he retained Molière’s plot: the duped Parisian bourgeois, Orgon, became a brocaded Mogul and Tartuffe, wonderfully played by Nizwar Karanj, a lecherous, shaven-headed guru in a saffron dhoti. Far from being mangled Molière, this was proof of the play’s classic status. It also demonstrated that, if you are going to reimagine a play, it’s no use tinkering at the edges: you have to find a precise social parallel that works on every level. Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto did just that when in 2018 they came up with an RSC Tartuffe that set the play among a family of Birmingham-based British-Pakistani Muslims. This did justice to Molière’s complexity while tackling contemporary issues. Here Orgon was a guilt-ridden businessman anxious to return to his Muslim roots and Tartuffe an aberrant outsider rather than a genuine product of Islam. But perhaps the shrewdest touch was to turn Molière’s maid into a Bosnian Muslim and authorial spokesperson: she capped Tartuffe’s quotes from the Qur’an about female modesty by arguing that there was nothing in it to prove that women should cover their hair or their heads. Not all updates are equally successful. Birmingham Rep did a Midlands-set Tartuffe in 2013 that turned the play into a vulgar panto. Marcus Gardley’s A Wolf in Snakeskin Shoes, seen in London in 2015, treated Tartuffe as a hedonistic healer from the deep south and made up in energy what it lacked in subtlety. Nearer the mark was John Donnelly’s 2019 National Theatre update which became as much a study of bourgeois angst as religious hypocrisy. Tartuffe is currently everyone’s favourite Molière but other plays have been subject to a culture shift. In 2002 the Scottish playwright Iain Heggie made Molière’s Don Juan a fading glam-rock star and Patrick Marber in Don Juan in Soho turned him, in David Tennant’s 2017 performance, into a priapic Peter Pan. But one test of any Molière production is whether it carries a note of ambivalence. Just as we should momentarily wonder if Tartuffe is more than a con man, Marber reminded us that Molière’s Don Juan, as well as being a heartless libertine, is also a rampant enemy of hypocrisy. Arguably, the biggest enemy of hypocrisy is Alceste in The Misanthrope. This is the most complex of all Molière’s plays in that Alceste is simultaneously a passionate truth teller and a victim of erotic enslavement. But although Martin Crimp did an agile update – seen with Damian Lewis and Keira Knightley in 2009 – it was hard to believe that a modern hypocrisy-basher would be punished for his sins rather than becoming a media celebrity. Adaptation, of course, is not the only route to Molière. It would be good, periodically, to see a production set in the plays’ historical context. But what is important is that we still go on staging one of the world’s great dramatists. What I find sad is that, in parochial Britain, his quatercentenary appears to be going signally and shamefully uncelebrated.",Arts/Stage,Britain’s indifference to Molière’s 400th is no surprise but it’s still shameful,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/18/britains-indifference-to-molieres-400th-is-no-surprise-but-its-still-shameful
1/18/2022,"Getting better is rarely something that happens all the time. Whether we’ve been seriously ill or injured, everyone has to experience the complexities of recovery as the aftermath. Aftermath is an old agricultural term meaning “a second crop” growing unexpectedly in the space left by the main harvest and it can entail difficult decisions about what should be done with these remnants. Recovery can feel like a second crop, something to be welcomed because we have survived, but an unpredictable and strange new phase in our healing. The medical professionals who have guided us through the harvest of treatment have usually moved on, replaced by different kinds of responders to the changes in our health. We find our questions about what is happening to us are answered more slowly, with what seems like a lower priority than before.  More of the work that is needed, it turns out, is up to us and it is likely to be slow going. Often, the field in which we have been left alone is vast and the ground is churned and the few green shoots growing there stand far apart and hardly seem worth gathering. Francis’s book explains recovery as a discrete therapeutic entity that deserves our full attention and why we should never give up trying to get better, even when it seems we couldn’t get much worse. Recovery is a difficult but essential part of what makes us human. In his characteristically deft case studies, he shows how it’s the time that recovery takes that is, over and over again, the greatest challenge to patient and care-giver. GPs might be allocated a certain number of minutes (or Zoom calls) with each of their recovering patients in which they might prescribe painkillers, talks with the physiotherapist, nature walks or participation in a group activity. Although focused on the individual, each time a doctor has a conversation with a patient about the time their recovery is taking, they are also addressing all of us, asking us to reset our expectations of medicine that have grown unrealistic. Not everything can be fixed quickly or easily and sometimes never quite completely. To show this, Francis recalls the rich history of slow-paced recovery and of the places and people who enabled it. Not all of it was effective (the milk cures that confined patients to bed for weeks did much harm and no good) but the underlying recognition of taking our time to rebuild ourselves is a profound insight into human regenerative capabilities. We used to know this, but somewhere in the white heat of changing medical technologies, we forgot and came instead to expect the instant and the effortless. Where Francis’s book is particularly strong is in delineating the different forms of recovery that humans are required to undertake. He looks at recovery from long Covid, from profound stress and unhappiness, from misfortune. Most powerfully of all, he describes how recovery is possible even if the biological causes of illness cannot be fixed. Recovery in the context of terminal illness is about resolution and the achievement of a kind of equilibrium in the remaining time left to a life-limited human. Francis draws on both the writings of Oliver Sacks and from his own patient list to relate the experiences of how it is to be both dying and, in truly remarkable ways, recovering new forms of humanity, even if only for a short while. This is a short and informative book for those involved in their own recovery and those who support them as they do so. It contains fascinating and useful tips to supplement standard medical resources available to patients (the absolute therapeutic importance of nature, achieving moments of grace, pets and why bathrobes are generally more useful than towels). For all of us managing our way through complicated lives that have yet to deliver the harvests we were expecting, Francis offers hope and a rare and precious form of quiet consolation.

1/18/2022,"New York City and some north-eastern US states appear to be seeing rapid decreases in their numbers of Covid-19 cases in recent days, raising the possibility that the Omicron wave has now already peaked in some parts of America. In New York City the rolling seven-day average of new cases was less than 28,000 a day on 16 January, down from an average of more than 40,000 on 9 January.  Similar patterns were being observed in the state as a whole and other nearby regions. “The Covid forecast is improving … the Covid clouds are parting,” said Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, in a statement Sunday after releasing figures that showed positivity rates in the state are falling sharply. “Overall, the prognosis, the forecast, for Covid is much brighter than it had been before.” Some 400,000 tests were conducted in New York on Saturday, with a positivity rate of 12.9%. Just one week ago, on a similar number of tests, the positivity rate was almost 20%. The state reported 51,264 new cases on Saturday, down from the peak of more than 90,000 a week earlier, according to a New York Times database. The number of people hospitalized fell for a fourth straight day. Several other north-east states – including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island – may be heading in a similar, down-trending direction. But in certain areas, including the Bronx in New York City, staff at hospital facilities have issued calls for help, saying they were struggling to treat a surging patient load. “Patients are lying in the hallway on stretchers that are touching each other,” said Karen Lam, an emergency room nurse in the Bronx. President Joe Biden and Hochul said military medical and National Guard teams would be dispatched to help. Over the weekend US surgeon general Vivek Murthy, warned that despite its rapid spread, Omicron had not yet peaked in the US as a whole. On a national level, the seven-day rolling average of new cases was still around 800,000 cases a day on 16 January, as it had been for the previous two days. Murthy warned that infections are set to continue to increase in much of the country and the “next few weeks will be tough”. The rates of infection and levels of hospitalization are set to be much higher in unvaccinated populations. “The challenge is that the entire country is not moving at the same pace,” Murthy said on CNN’s State of the Union. “The Omicron wave started later in other parts of the country. We shouldn’t expect a national peak in the coming days.” The Biden administration has been battered by accusations that it failed to anticipate demand for testing after a national vaccine and re-vaccination or booster drive showed clear signs of faltering. The administration has also faced criticism that it failed to anticipate demand for therapeutic antiviral treatments. The CDC, too, has faced criticism. With little available data on Omicron, the agency has attempted to move faster with recommendations, including by cutting the isolation periods and drop a negative test result as a requirement for leaving isolation. But that was offset by employers requiring a negative test before infected Americans could return to work, creating pressure on testing capacity that authorities have struggled to meet. CDC director Rochelle Walensky told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Monday that she was committed to communicating CDC policy more clearly. “I think what I have not conveyed is the uncertainty in a lot of these situations,” Walensky said. “We felt the need to take action before we had Omicron-specific data,” she added. In a statement last week, the White House said it would purchase $1bn tests to distribute free. A half-billion would be available for order on 19 January and mailed directly on request, with up to four free tests per residential address. “This program will ensure that Americans have at-home, rapid COVID-19 tests available in the weeks and months ahead—in addition to the number of other ways they can get tested,” the White House said.",News/World news,New York and other north-eastern US states see a rapid fall in Covid cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/us-coronavirus-cases-decrease-latest
1/18/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is weighing whether to subpoena some of Donald Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill as it considers its options on how aggressively it should pursue testimony to move forward its inquiry into the January 6 insurrection. The Republican House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and Republican members of Congress Jim Jordan and Scott Perry may have inside knowledge about Trump’s plan to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election and whether it was coordinated with the Capitol attack.  But the outright refusal of McCarthy and the other Republican lawmakers to testify voluntarily with the investigation has intensified discussions among the panel’s members and investigators about whether to force their cooperation. The select committee is undecided on whether to take that near-unprecedented step, in part because of one major concern that has emerged in recent days, according to two sources familiar with the matter: Republican retaliation against Biden and Democrats in future inquiries. In private conversations, some members and investigators on the select committee have expressed how appalled they are at the refusal of McCarthy and the Republican lawmakers to help the investigation, and feel prepared to subpoena for their testimony, the sources said. But the one major recurring worry raised in discussions, the sources said, is that subpoenas might create moral hazard for Republicans plotting an onslaught of partisan investigations into the Biden administration should they retake the House after the 2022 midterms – as many observers think likely. Republicans in Congress have openly floated the prospect in recent days of launching political probes into the Biden administration’s coronavirus response, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the personal life of Biden’s son Hunter, as well as an impeachment inquiry. In response, some members and investigators on the select committee have quietly raised the possibility that if the panel declines to subpoena Republicans now, then a Republican majority might not subpoena Democrats in the future, the sources said. The issue has proved a difficult conundrum for the select committee, which started serious discussions about subpoenas to Republicans after Jordan and Perry refused to cooperate, and escalated the urgency of talks after McCarthy also declined to help the inquiry. The panel was particularly outraged by McCarthy’s refusal and his statement attacking their request for an interview as “abuse of power” and intensified its research into parliamentary rules governing their ability to authorize subpoenas, the sources said. Even in the absence of any formal decision, the possibility of subpoenas has already become a touch point as the select committee grapples with the so-called speech and debate clause in the constitution that shields lawmakers while they perform their official duties. The clause says lawmakers “shall not be questioned in any other place” about speech or debate, and is generally interpreted to cover all legislative actions – which Republicans argue precludes them from having to answer the select committee’s investigation. But the members on the panel believe the law does not extend to protect lawmakers from Congress’s own investigations, rejecting the idea that McCarthy, Jordan and Perry have any claim to immunity as the panel investigates whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy. There is also precedent for the House to subpoena its own members. The House ethics committee, which investigates allegations of wrongdoing by members of Congress, for instance has the authority under House rules to subpoena lawmakers – orders they cannot refuse. A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment on internal discussions about how aggressively the panel might act to secure cooperation from McCarthy, or whether counsel for the panel has reached a determination on the matter. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, previously said in his request for cooperation to McCarthy that the panel was interested in details about McCarthy’s conversations with Trump before, during and after the Capitol attack. But it is also not immediately clear whether McCarthy would have substantially new information to share with House investigators beyond what is already public – meaning the marginal benefit to getting his testimony may not outweigh the potential political consequences. There remains a possibility that McCarthy, Perry and Jordan might cooperate with the select committee in the event of a subpoena, using the potential legal threat to justify their reversals to Trump, who the Guardian reported last month is agitated by the investigation. If the select committee decides it has the authority and resolve to issue subpoenas, the sources said, then the primary remaining question would likely be a matter of timing, and when best in the investigation the panel should force their cooperation. But the worry about Republican retaliation reflects the select committee’s recognition that the stakes of issuing subpoenas to Republican lawmakers and McCarthy, the man poised to become speaker in 2022 should his party retake the House majority, could not be higher. Additional concerns have centered on the ability to enforce subpoenas to Republican lawmakers if the select committee did take that step, and whether a federal judge would countenance becoming mired in what is essentially becoming a partisan fight in Congress. Congressman Adam Schiff, a member of the select committee, suggested on MSNBC the panel, for that reason, would likely not pursue criminal contempt of Congress proceedings with recalcitrant lawmakers as it did with Trump’s former aides Mark Meadows and Steve Bannon. Moving ahead with criminal contempt of Congress against the Republican lawmakers would mark an escalation that tests the limits of congressional subpoenas, threatening to touch off a legal fight the panel might not have time to conclude as it races to finish its report. The former Republican chairman of the House oversight committee, Trey Gowdy – who also oversaw the inquiry into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails – demurred on subpoenaing Democrats over concerns about enforceability, a source close to Gowdy said. Gowdy faced internal pressure from the House Republican conference for his reluctance to subpoena Democrats, the source said, but that was in part to make sure lawmakers would not defang the power of congressional subpoenas if they simply refused to comply. That leaves the select committee with only a handful of options, which appear to rest on a gamble over whether it can shame Republicans into cooperating, including a formal resolution on the House floor censuring or admonishing the lawmakers.",News/US news,Capitol attack panel grapples with moving inquiry forward: to subpoena or not?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/17/us-capitol-attack-panel-inquiry-subpoena
1/18/2022,"You can clearly see Clarion House from high up on the ridge between Barrowford and Roughlee. Not only because it stands alone on a green slope, nor because it is handsome and proud, though it absolutely is. No, you can see it because of the red – bright, beautiful, luscious scarlet, the glowing red of the Red Flag, the Independent Labour Party (ILP) logo, the Lancashire rose and the clenched fist of International Socialism.  I saw Clarion House for the first time by chance as I was driving back from Roughlee, after showing my brother and nephew the metal statue of Alice Nutter. She was the one Lancashire “witch” who had more than two ha’pennies to rub together but was nonetheless hanged for her sex, or her stubbornness. There, by the roadside, was a pretty single-storey red-and-white building, with a simple trumpet for its logo and a fascinating information board about the local Labour movement, and about radical rambling and cycling. I didn’t loiter but I was curious. Why hadn’t I been taught about the Clarion Houses before? I got to see a bit more of the place when I joined an activity day organised by the excellent Pendle Hill Partnership. After a short walk and some male bonding and craft-type work in the lovely garden, I took a closer look. The house was built in 1912 by the Nelson branch of the ILP along Arts and Crafts lines. Inside were posters from the Spanish civil war, a photograph of Keir Hardie, a beautiful piece of stained glass, and a banner emblazoned with “Workers of the World Unite”. Soft sunlight streamed in through the many windows. Long benches were laid out for reading the Morning Star or, more likely, for a natter. As one of my crafting comrades remarked: “This place has a special feeling, a warm feeling.” A few weeks later, I joined a Clarion-themed walk with local guide Nick Burton, set up by Mid Pennine Arts as part of its Pendle Radicals programme. This time I had the chance to linger and loiter, enjoy a pint mug of tea served by Charles Jepson – sporting a shiny Clarion Cycling Club jersey and a superb moustache – and learn a bit more. Clarion House is a vestige of a better past and a symbol of a possible future. In essence, it was a meeting and resting place for workers from nearby mills and factories, who had come up into the countryside around Pendle Hill to escape the grime and noise of increasingly congested towns such as Colne and Brierfield. It was the third such house in the area, two previous rented sites (a terrace at Thorneyholme Square and Nabs Farm, which we saw on our walk) having proved unsatisfactory. In late 1911 or early 1912, the Nelson ILP Land Society secured a low-interest loan for £350 from the Nelson Weavers’ Association. It was a significant amount of money at the time, indicative of the strength of commitment to supporting recreation for ordinary people, and of the level of cooperation between local organisations. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Clarion Houses had popped up in several rural areas. Many were linked to cycling clubs, and some provided accommodation as well as refreshments. In 1897, a Clarion House opened at Bucklow Hill, near Tatton Park in Cheshire. Photographs and documents record further Clarion Houses at Colne, Burnley and the Ribble valley, Halewood in Merseyside and Sheldon in Birmingham. Assiduous researchers Melvyn Hirst and John Boardman provide rich accounts of 10 Clarion Houses on a dedicated website. Sadly, the Clarion House I “discovered” is the only one still standing. There are still a number of Clarion cycling clubs, and keen riders often make pilgrimages to this site – though, as happens with leftwing groups, there has recently been a rupture, with the National Clarion Cycling Club removing the word “socialism” from its constitution. Clarion House is open to the public only on Sundays, though lots of walkers drop by during the week to enjoy their butties and cuppas on the wooden benches – many bearing memorial plaques to past members who were regular visitors. It’s in a great spot, with views down the valley to Blacko Hill, and is easily accessed by footpaths from Barley and Newchurch. It’s close to the Pendle Way and Two Roses Way. The summit of Pendle Hill is about an hour’s walk. Ten miles to the East, Boulsworth Hill looms over the Pennine Way. Up close the house is actually not that red. But the front door, window frames and parts of the exterior wall and chimney are painted bright scarlet, and roof tiles are in a rich terracotta. Or maybe it was just me, searching for a ruddy beacon of hope among the sheep fields and posh villages. All the best ideas have an element of utopianism within them. In my dream future UK, there are Clarion Houses dotted all over our regreened, rewilded nation, serving as waystations and watering holes on Slow Ways that join up all our hamlets and villages, towns and cities. That’s my clarion call for today. Clarion House is on Jinny Lane between Roughlee and Newchurch, and is. open Sundays 10.30am-4pm",Lifestyle/Travel,"Walkers of the world unite!

1/18/2022,"Chinese authorities captured more than 2,500 “fugitives” from overseas and brought them back to China during the pandemic, under a program using methods ranging from family intimidation to “state-sanctioned kidnapping”, according to a new report. Human rights group Safeguard Defenders estimates in its report published on Tuesday that the continued repatriations now total more than 10,000 since Beijing launched operation Fox Hunt in 2014, followed by Sky Net in 2015.  During the pandemic, at least 1,421 people were brought back to China in 2020 and 1,114 in 2021, based on government figures, despite international lockdowns and travel restrictions. The figures only include those captured for purported economic crimes or crimes related to their official duties. In December 2021 the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) described the year’s operation as “fruitful”. In 2018 Sky Net was moved under the control of the newly formed non-judicial body, the National Supervision Commission. In February 2021 the commission relaunched the program, expanding it to fugitives in the fields of political and legal affairs, and civil affairs. Human rights groups believe activists and dissidents are now often targeted, including Uyghurs and Hongkongers living overseas. In July the Uyghur Human Rights Project documented 395 cases of Uyghurs being deported, extradited, or rendered back to China. “Since Xi Jinping came to power the Chinese government intensified the crackdown on civil society,” said US-based human rights activist Teng Biao. “They have targeted lawyers and dissidents, bloggers, journalists, Tibetans, Uyghurs, Hong Kongers, everything in civil society.” The methods to force someone back to China, outside formal bilateral agreements on extradition and deportation, can range from refusing to renew a passport, to misusing the Interpol red notice system to have international warrants issued, the report said. They also include exit bans and intimidation of targets’ family members in China, and in-person threats by Chinese agents operating on foreign soil. At the more extreme end of the scale are acts which Safeguard Defenders termed state-sanctioned kidnappings, but which Beijing calls “irregular methods”. These sometimes involved covert operations in conjunction with host country forces, the report said, or tricking the target into going to a third country where they could be extradited. Safeguard Defenders mapped 80 cases of attempted apprehension, of which it said about half were successful. It identified targets across dozens of countries, including the US, UK, and Australia. Instances of family intimidation have been widely reported among the Uyghur diaspora, particularly those who are politically active outside China, lobbying for international action on the human rights abuses being committed in Xinjiang. In 2021 reports revealed Mihray Erkin, a young Uyghur woman, was believed to have died in detention in Xinjiang, in 2020. Erkin had been working in Japan as a scientific researcher until she returned to Xinjiang in 2019, allegedly after her parents were pressured to call her home. Also last year, 19-year-old Wang Jingyu, a US permanent resident who was wanted in China over online comments after he criticised the government on Weibo, claimed his parents were repeatedly harassed and detained in an attempt to have him return. Teng said he’d come across many cases of family intimidation, including jailing family members in China to pressure overseas targets. “Sometimes they were arbitrarily arrested or detained, followed by secret police, interrogated, sometimes forced to make a video phone call with their wife or husband or children who live overseas,” he told the Guardian. “Because it’s a totalitarian system the government has the power – not legal power, but power that is above the law – and they can force a company or work unit to fire anyone they want.” Chinese authorities have publicly lauded the program, with a 2015 notice from the CCDI claiming more than 70 “working groups” had been sent to 90 countries and regions, with the special operations “fully supported by overseas law enforcement agencies, Chinese embassies and consulates abroad, and police liaison officers”. Safeguard Defenders called for world governments to end extradition treaties with China, and to evaluate and terminate any bilateral judicial cooperation arrangements with the NSC. “While there are legitimate reasons for, albeit cautiously, engaging in international judicial cooperation with Beijing, China’s violations of other nations’ judicial sovereignty and breaking customs in international judicial cooperation undermines the trust required for entering into such cooperation, or continuing existing cooperation,” it said. Yaqiu Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch, said host countries had to be careful about China-requested extraditions. “They should ensure individuals residing in their countries that are wanted by the Chinese government have adequate protection, and investigate possible harassment and other abuses by Chinese officials or their agents against these individuals or their family members,” she said. “Authorities should also provide them with adequate opportunity to contest the extradition, and not return anyone to China if they are likely to face persecution, torture or ill-treatment there.” China has always denied its actions are kidnappings, or that it violates foreign and international laws. “In the process of carrying out its international anti-corruption operations, China has always strictly abided by the domestic laws of the target countries, international laws and international judicial and law enforcement practices,” the CCDI said in a state media report in November 2020.

Not “rude remark” terrible, not “accounting mistake” terrible, but “falling out of a window” terrible. To drink like this, you would have to be both in the 60s and in a film. Nevertheless, a couple of pints at lunchtime, even in reputable careers such as teaching, was still commonplace in the 80s. By the 90s, it had mainly been phased out – except if you were a journalist. When I got my first job on a paper in 1994, it was routine to arrive at 10am, go to lunch at 12.30pm, come back to the office at 2pm to leave your jacket on the chair (the universal camouflage of the presentee), go back to the pub, then regroup in the office at 4.30pm to collect your jacket. When the nation decided to put in charge of the country a bunch of men whose formative professional years were 80s and 90s Fleet Street, the obvious risks were that they would run the place like a newspaper column, with tiny amounts of knowledge parlayed into huge statements that, unlike a column, would turn into concrete acts, and have consequences for millions of lives. That turned out to be devastatingly true, but what, weirdly, none of us predicted was that it would also turn Downing Street into a year-round Oktoberfest.

1/18/2022,"Joe Biden ends his first year in office at a particularly bleak moment for a US president who promised competency and normalcy. Much of his domestic agenda is stalled on Capitol Hill, impeded by members of his own party. The virus is once again raging out of control: daily infections of Covid-19 have soared to record levels, hospitalizing more Americans than at any previous point during the pandemic. The administration’s vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers was blocked by the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority. Inflation is at a nearly 40-year high. Diplomatic talks have so far failed to pull Russia back from the brink of war with Ukraine.  After winning more votes than any presidential candidate in American history, Biden is now – just 12 months later – one of the country’s most unpopular presidents. For months, Biden’s approval ratings have languished in the mid to low 40s, with an average approval rating of 42%. ​​A Quinnipiac poll released last week found him at a dire 33%, which the White House has dismissed as an outlier. Nevertheless, among his modern predecessors, only Donald Trump fared worse at this point in their presidencies. The puzzle of Biden’s unpopularity has many pieces, pollsters and political analysts say. Biden came to office with lofty ambitions: he promised to lift the threat of deadly virus and usher in a new era of responsive governance and bipartisanship in Washington. One year into his presidency, Biden remains confronted by an unabating pandemic, a nation still very much divided and a Republican party that continues to embrace the lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. “Whenever a president disappoints expectations, that’s a problem,” said Bill Galston, a senior fellow of governance studies at the Brookings Institution who also served as a White House policy adviser to former President Clinton. Galston said the administration has “not done a good job of managing expectations” around Covid. In July, Biden came just shy of declaring “independence” from the virus, only to be proven wrong by the arrival of the fast-spreading Delta variant. Now, amid a surge caused by the Omicron variant, the president and his team are recalibrating. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, recently said that Omicron would “find just about everybody”. Biden recently conceded that eradicating the virus was unlikely, but that it was possible to “control” it. It is the case for swing voters who believed Biden would govern as a centrist bridge-builder in an age of deep division, Galston continued, and for Democrats to whom Biden promised an ambitious legislative agenda despite holding wafer-thin margins in Congress. Sarah Longwell, a prominent anti-Trump Republican strategist, has observed support for the president decline among voters in the focus groups she has convened over the past year. When asked to grade Biden’s first year, many voters she spoke to, including Democrats, gave him Cs, Ds and Fs. The grades, Longwell said, not only reflected their views of the president, but also a shared discontent as the pandemic enters its third year and inflation continues to rise. “There’s an element of it that has nothing to do with Joe Biden,” Longwell said. “It’s just a tough time.” Asked about Biden’s gloomy reviews, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, offered a similar explanation. “People are fatigued across the country. It’s impacting how they live, how they work. There are worries about their kids, their ability to experience joyful things in life like concerts and going to restaurants and seeing friends,” Psaki said. “We understand that.” “The president knows that the best, most important step he can take is to continue to fight to get the pandemic under control and also to lower costs for Americans across the country,” she added. Biden’s popularity began to slip as the Delta variant of Covid-19 spread across the country, falling sharply after the US’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 service members were killed by a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport. Though a majority of Americans favored withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, the desperate scenes from Kabul as the Taliban took control undercut perceptions of Biden as a seasoned foreign policy expert who would restore America’s standing on the world stage. “The way in which we left Afghanistan inflicted a blow on the president’s general image of experience and competence, which had a lingering effect,” Galston said. Historically, voters tend to punish the president’s party in the first midterm elections after a new administration takes power. But the defeats tend to be steeper when a president is unpopular. According to Gallup polling, presidents with job approval ratings below 50% have seen their parties lose an average of 37 House seats during the midterm elections. Already Republicans’ unexpected strength last year in off-cycle elections in states Biden won by wide margins in 2020 – like Virginia and New Jersey – has delivered a stark warning of a dangerous future to Democrats. The results suggested that the resistance-driven passion that drove Democratic victories during the Trump era had fizzled. Perhaps most alarming for Democrats was the electorate’s deep sense of malaise. Despite a mass vaccination campaign and trillions of dollars in relief money, voters feel worse now about the state of the pandemic and the economy than they did earlier in Biden’s presidency, according to a CBS News/YouGov survey. Few voters give Biden credit for muscling through a trillion-dollar investment in the nation’s infrastructure or passing the American Rescue Plan, which sent checks to most Americans and slashed poverty rates. “It’s an ironic situation where the policies are more popular than the politicians, which is very rare,” said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster. “Usually it’s the other way around.” Further capturing that frustration, a Gallup poll released on Monday found a dramatic shift in party preference over the last year, swinging from a nine-point Democratic advantage at the beginning of 2021 to a five-point Republican advantage by the end of the year. The change follows the collapse of Biden’s presidential approval ratings. This augurs poorly for Democrats, leaving a narrowing window to deliver on their campaign promises, from Build Back Better to voting rights and immigration reform. Messy intra-party negotiations over Biden’s sprawling climate and social policy bill overshadowed the policy, leaving the public with a shallow understanding of its contents and concern over its cost. The legislation remains in limbo after Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, announced he could not support the measure in its current form. Amid the stalemate over his agenda, Democrats have become disenchanted with Biden. He is bleeding support among young voters angry over inaction on climate change, health care and student debt forgiveness. Hispanic voters have lost confidence in Biden’s handling of the pandemic and the economy, a red flag for Democrats after they shifted toward Trump and the Republican party in 2020. And support has been sliding among Black voters, who were critical to Biden’s victory but have been disappointed by the lack of progress on voting rights and police reform. In an attempt to reset, Biden recently delivered a pair of searing speeches, during which he implored the Senate to pass federal voting rights legislation and accused Republicans who stand in the way of standing on the side of Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis. Though not all the variables are within Biden’s control, Lake said there is still plenty of time– and opportunities – to improve his standing before the midterms in November. She said the president’s newly emboldened tone was a good start, that would help to “energize” Democrats, while signalling “strength” to wary independents. “He’s in leadership mode now,” she said. Democrats widely applauded Biden’s rhetorical shift, but some civil rights leaders and voting rights advocates boycotted the speech in Atlanta to express disapproval of what they view as a belated push on an issue that is paramount for their communities and the functioning of democracy itself. In a statement, the president of the NAACP Derrick Johnson, said it was past time for the administration to “match their words with actions”. Lorella Praeli, co-president of the progressive group, Community Change Action, said voters need to see Biden fighting on their behalf. She urged the president to use every executive tool at his disposal to ease the financial pressures facing millions of Americans, like canceling student debt, as he continues to push for a path forward on Build Back Better, voting rights and immigration reform. Part of the challenge for Biden, she said, is to convince a demoralized public that “the future is still up for grabs”. “Fight for people, deliver for people and then make sure they know what has happened,” she said. “It’s really that simple.”",News/US news,‘It’s a tough time’: why is Biden one of the most unpopular US presidents?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/18/joe-biden-approval-ratings-first-year-democrats
1/18/2022,"Indonesia plans to name its new capital Nusantara, which translates as “archipelago”, when government offices are relocated to the province of East Kalimantan from Jakarta, on the island of Java. President Joko Widodo first announced the plan to move Indonesia’s capital in 2019, in an effort to relieve the huge environmental challenges facing Jakarta, and to redistribute wealth. The move has been delayed due to the pandemic, but could go ahead in 2024.  The government hopes it will reduce the burden on Jakarta, a city of 10 million, which is notoriously congested, suffers regular flooding, and is one of the fastest sinking cities in the world due to the over extraction of groundwater. Parts of north Jakarta are falling at an estimated 25cm a year, due to subsidence – including even the seawall designed as a buffer for communities. The new name had been selected from more than 80 options by Widodo and was chosen because it reflected Indonesia’s geography, and was iconic internationally, said Suharso Monoarfa, the national development planning minister. Some have pointed out that the choice could prove confusing since Nusantara is also used to refer to the archipelago nation as a whole. Others have questioned why Nusantara, an old Javanese term, was selected when the new capital was being built in Kalimantan. Construction could start this year, after a bill on the new capital was approved by parliament on Tuesday. By relocating the capital, the government also hopes to redistribute wealth. Java is home to 60% of the country’s population and more than half of its economic activity - even though Kalimantan is almost four times bigger. Under the project, Jakarta will remain the country’s commercial and financial centre, but government administrative functions will move to East Kalimantan, about 2,000km (1,250 miles) north-east of Jakarta. The new capital will be based in the regions of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara. Environmentalists have warned the move risks accelerating pollution in East Kalimantan, and contributing to the destruction of rainforests that are home to orangutans, sun bears and long-nosed monkeys.",News/World news,"Indonesia names new capital Nusantara, replacing sinking Jakarta",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/indonesia-names-new-capital-nusantara-replacing-sinking-city-of-jakarta
1/18/2022,"Aerial images prepared by the New Zealand defence force for the Tongan government have been leaked online and show some areas have had “catastrophic” devastation inflicted by the tsunami and volcanic eruption while others were relatively unscathed.  The 40 aerial pictures show some areas blanketed with ash, with damaged buildings, while others show parts of the country that appear unscathed. They were taken by the New Zealand defence force during a reconnaissance flight on Monday and put together in a report for the Tongan government. The photos were then leaked online. The Guardian has confirmed the provenance of the photos. After the reconnaissance flight, the New Zealand defence force shared a handful of photos with media, most of them showing defence personnel at work, rather than shots of the islands. The 40 leaked images paint a much fuller picture of the damage to the country, and include annotations about the severity of damage. Many areas were assessed as having limited damage, such as ash on building roofs, pools of surface flooding or debris. But others were judged to have sustained “catastrophic” damage, according to notes on the images. Atata island was noted to have “a large number of buildings missing. Remaining structures probably had flood damage. Multiple trees were uprooted, with debris throughout.” Fonoifua Island was said to have sustained “extensive damage … with all but the largest buildings destroyed or severely damaged”. Mango Island, a remote low-lying island home to 69 people, was assessed as having “catastrophic damage”. A distress sign was detected from Mango Island on Monday by the UN prompting concern for inhabitants. “Catastrophic damage was observed with the entire village destroyed. Temporary tarpaulin shelters had been erected on the island’s higher areas. Debris was observed throughout the village,” said the annotated image. The images also gave a sense of the damage to Tonga’s infrastructure sustained during the tsunami and volcani eruption. The defence force said there had been “limited” damage to the Fua’amotu International Airport’s south-eastern runway, but that it was currently “unserviceable” due to ash covering the runway. However, the defence force noted that an operation to clear ash from the runway was under way, with vehicles and people visible from the air. “Clearance operations by shovel and wheelbarrow were under way on the SE end of the runway. No heavy excavation machinery was observed,” a note on the image said. The defence force also noted that airport buildings appear intact, though there was a layer of ash on the surfaces. The report noted that Nuku’alofa port in the capital had “limited to moderate damage” with some surface flooding and road access to the wharf obstructed by fallen containers, ash and other debris. The Faleniu gas station on Uiha Island was assessed as “serviceable”, as was the Pangai ferry terminal, the wharf at Ha’ano and the bridge between Koulo and Fangale’ounga. Little has been heard from Tonga since the eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano and subsequent tsunami on Saturday, after the Pacific nation’s main communication cable was broken. It may be weeks before the cable can be repaired, due to difficulty getting the repair ship from Papua New Guinea to Tonga, and safety concerns for the crew of the ship, who would be operating in waters not far from the volcano, meaning Tongans around the world may be forced to wait weeks for regular contact to resume. On Tuesday, New Zealand’s ministry of foreign affairs and trade said there had been two confirmed deaths in Tonga from the disaster, one of which was a British national. There have been no official confirmations of casualties from Tongan authorities, but the family of Angela Glover, a British woman living in Tonga who went missing in the tsunami, reported on Monday that her body had been found. The 50-year-old, who had been living in Tonga since about 2015, was swept away by the tsunami. The Australian defence force also sent a surveillance plane on Monday, to assess damage to critical infrastructure such as roads, ports and power lines. Australia and New Zealand have each pledged $1m in initial aid to Tonga. New Zealand has dispatched two naval ships carrying water and other aid supplies.",News/World news,Leaked New Zealand military photos show scale of damage caused by Tonga volcano eruption,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/tonga-volcano-leaked-new-zealand-military-photos-scale-of-damage
1/18/2022,"Good morning, I’m Warren Murray and this is your briefing – none shall be turned away.  Rebel Tories are upping pressure on Boris Johnson to quit over the Downing Street parties scandal, with one naming their plan “Operation Rinka” in reference to the dog killed in the Jeremy Thorpe affair in the 1970s. It comes in answer to Downing Street insiders reportedly devising a plan to sack officials and save Johnson, referred to as “Operation Save Big Dog”, and its sibling “Operation Red Meat” to divert pubic attention on to other issues. A senior government source said multiple groups were angry with Johnson: lockdown sceptics, disgruntled ex-ministers, and MPs from former Labour red wall seats. “It only takes a dozen letters from each group to get you close to the 54 you need [to trigger a no-confidence vote in the prime minister].” Outside parliament, 40% of grassroots Tories want Johnson to resign. Dominic Cummings has accused Johnson of lying after No 10 denied the prime minister was warned against allowing a “bring your own booze” party. Cummings said he personally told the principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, who organised it that the invitation broke the rules, and that Reynolds replied: “So long as it’s socially distanced I think it’s OK, I’ll check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead.” Cummings said in a blogpost: “Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened.” John Griffin, the taxi firm tycoon who has given £4m to the Tories since 2013, has joined calls for Boris Johnson to resign. Peter Hargreaves, the Brexit-backing billionaire who gave £1m to the Tories for the 2019 general elections campaign, said of Johnson: “He doesn’t want to do good – he just wants to be prime minister. That’s his only agenda.” Covid latest – Speaking of Operation Red Meat: No 10 has signalled plans to phase out England’s remaining pandemic restrictions from as early as March. Some scientists have warned against downgrading laws that reduce the spread of Covid, while others have said it is a logical next step. In the US, four jail inmates have filed a lawsuit saying they were unknowingly given ivermectin by a prison doctor as a form of medical experimentation despite US health officials warning it should not be used to treat Covid-19. Australia has reported its highest ever Covid daily death toll – more on this and other developments at our global live blog. Tonga under veil of ash – Some of the first images have emerged from Tonga’s volcano and tsunami-hit islands, after a New Zealand defence force surveillance flight returned from the cut-off country, as two deaths from the disaster on Saturday have been confirmed. Land and trees are shown coated with ash and other damage. The Fua’amotu international airport runway appears inundated. Other satellite images show that flooding came in several blocks from the coastline. On Tuesday, New Zealand’s ministry of foreign affairs and trade said there had been two confirmed deaths, one of them a British national as previously reported. Australia and New Zealand are sending planes and ships to assist. The islands’ undersea communications cable is believed to be cut about 37km offshore and could take weeks to repair. ‘Heat or eat’ – Energy bills could eat up more than half of some UK households’ incomes, poverty charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) has said. Households across the board faced bill increases of 40% to 47% from April and there would be huge variations in their ability to cope: single-adult households on low incomes could be forced to spend 54% of their income on gas and electricity when the energy price cap changes on 1 April, the JRF found. Martin Lewis from MoneySavingExpert, said the government must provide billions in support to poorer households facing “heat or eat” decisions. A government spokesperson said: We will continue to look closely at the pressures facing people and what further measures might be needed on abating high energy costs.” Lords rebuke – The House of Lords has voted to make misogyny a hate crime in England and Wales – an idea rejected by both Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab – in a night of several defeats for the government in the upper chamber. The vote came during debate over the crime, sentencing and courts bill. The government lost 14 divisions, including plans to make people locking themselves on to objects punishable by up to 51 weeks’ imprisonment, suspicion-less stop-and-search and introduction of “serious disruption prevention orders” against protesters. Peers also voted to block proposals to give police new powers to stop noisy and disruptive protests in England and Wales. Once the Lords have completed their scrutiny, the bill will return to the House of Commons. It needs both houses’ approval. ‘Loud’ lecturer wins sacking case – A senior academic who says she was sacked from her University of Exeter physics post because of her loud voice has been awarded more than £100,000 after winning a claim for unfair dismissal. Dr Annette Plaut told the Guardian she had a “naturally loud voice” that came from her middle European Jewish background and it was the combination of her being “female and loud” that led to her dismissal. Plaut, who worked there for 29 years, said she was taking medication for stress since her sacking. The university argued during a tribunal that she was dismissed over the way she dealt with two PhD students and insists it had nothing to do with her background or her sex. The university has said it will appeal against the tribunal’s decision. As Boris Johnson faces questions over his future, Conservative members and MPs are looking at their options for who might replace him – and one name keeps coming up.

Everton’s attempt to rehire Roberto Martínez has hit an immediate problem with the Royal Belgian Football Association rejecting a proposal for their head coach to combine his role with managing the Premier League club. Eddie Jones is free to select unvaccinated players in a bumper 36-man rugby Six Nations squad despite strict travel rules that look set to rule them out of two of England’s three away fixtures, including a potential decider against France on Super Saturday. Ali Martin writes that excuses can be made for England’s Ashes shambles, but the status quo cannot hold, and England’s muddled selections, fitness issues and abject batting suggest a deeper malaise. The International Olympic Committee’s new transgender framework has come under fire from medical experts who work for multiple sports federations, who say it opens the door to unfair competition in female sport. In a notable intervention, the scientists warn that the IOC’s new guidance – which states there is no need for trans women to lower their testosterone to compete against natal women – ignores the science on sex, gender and performance and focuses mostly on inclusion. Asian shares have mostly been higher in the absence of big market-moving news following the Martin Luther King Day holiday in the US. The Bank of Japan wrapped up a two-day policy meeting with no major changes, keeping the benchmark interest rate at a longstanding -0.1%. Benchmarks in Japan, China and Australia rose in early trading but shares fell in South Korea. Futures trading predicts the FTSE opening about 10-15 points lower. The pound is worth $1.363 and €1.196 at time of writing. The splash in the Times today is “Cummings: PM lied to parliament about party” while the Mirror calls this a “New bombshell claim” saying Johnson “gave the go-ahead”. Metro’s top story is “I’ll swear PM lied to house”, paraphrasing Cummings – readers might recall that on a previous occasion, when testifying did not suit his ends, the same individual was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear. The Guardian’s front page leads with “Cummings accuses PM of lying over No 10 party”, and also featured are “UK sending anti-tank weapons to Ukraine”, as well as “Inquiry launched into Mone over ‘VIP lane’ deal”. The i is more general: “Tory angst at Johnson leadership growing”. The Express would prefer we look over there at something else, while still appearing to chastise the PM, telling him to “sort energy bills crisis” . The Financial Times has that one too: “Ministers explore paying energy suppliers to ease household bills”. The Mail says “British troops sent to Ukraine”; the Telegraph leads with “Tougher powers for magistrates to clear trial backlog”; while the Sun has a totally bizarre lead story about Prince Andrew and plush toys.
