4/22/2022,"The Irish sportswriter Kieran Cunningham belongs to a small group of investigative journalists who are entitled to feel proud of their resolute courage and persistence in exposing Daniel Kinahan and his damaging control of boxing. Last Tuesday, at an extraordinary press conference in Dublin, US government officials stressed their determination to bring down the intimidating drug cartel allegedly run by Kinahan and his family. “I would never think of it in terms of vindication,” Cunningham says after stressing that the journalistic heroes are the Irish crime reporters who investigated Kinahan long before he turned to boxing. “I just felt relieved, because it’s taken up so much space in my head for years. It felt like banging your head against a brick wall. Everyone who works in boxing would just say: ‘That’s boxing. It’s always been like this.’ As long as the fights are made they don’t care.” Cunningham acknowledges that the omertà is partly driven by fear. In a similarly insidious way there is no corner within boxing which is not linked in some way to Kinahan. I have spoken to many fighters and trainers, most of whom are good people, and they remain unwilling to talk on the record for fear of reprisals or being shut out of the sport. Kinahan has undoubtedly been generous to the boxers he advises but in exchange they had to ignore or dismiss the allegations surrounding him. It has become a source of embarrassment and shame for boxing. For this reason it is instructive to hear from Cunningham and Stephen Dempster, another investigative reporter who produced last year’s BBC Panorama documentary which brought Kinahan’s involvement in boxing to mainstream attention. “I’m not this great moral compass,” Cunningham says as he explains how boxing crisscrosses the deadly feud in Dublin between the Kinahan and Hutch gangs. “Where I live in Dublin is 15 minutes from the north inner city. That’s boxing country. There’s a street called Champions Avenue where so many boxing champions came from. Kellie Harrington, who became Olympic champion last year, is from there. It’s near where Muhammad Ali fought Al ‘Blue’ Lewis at Croke Park 50 years ago this summer. Just down the road you find the Point Depot, as it used to be called, where Lennox Lewis, Naseem Hamed and Tyson Fury all fought. “Seven of the people killed in the Hutch-Kinahan feud died in these same streets. Boxing is Ireland’s international sport by a mile, and it’s the one closest to the Irish psyche. I like boxing people because there is a rawness and truth to them. Many of them are abused by boxing and it really gnawed at me that Kinahan was seen as one of the good guys. I always knew he was going to be toxic. Professional boxing south of the border has already been killed.” In February 2016 the Irish Gardaí believed that the Hutch gang aimed to kill Kinahan at the weigh-in for a European lightweight title fight. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, they allegedly shot and murdered David Byrne – who was associated with Kinahan. Revenge killings followed and, since then, there have only been small-hall boxing shows in Ireland. Dempster, a boxing fan as well as an investigative journalist, comes from Belfast, where the sport still thrives. His reaction to last week’s announcement of US sanctions against the Kinahans, and the offer of a $5m (£3.8m) reward for information leading to their arrest, echoes the response of many. “I was shocked,” Dempster says. “I’ve never seen a press conference where government and law enforcement officials are so open. They are usually so cagey about naming names and potentially prejudicing future legal action. For years the Irish Gardaí wouldn’t even say the name ‘Kinahan’. They would talk around it. This was a total gamechanger. You can now see how the dominoes are slowly falling one by one.” Kinahan remains exiled in Dubai and denies all wrongdoing. But it was revealed that the United Arab Emirates has frozen the assets of the Kinahan family. Cunningham explains that “Ireland has been pressing the UAE for years to extradite Kinahan. But Ireland is a tiny dot on the edge of Europe. America is the global superpower and the UAE are keen not to fall out with the Americans. So last week changed everything. “What surprises me most is that it took so long. Why wasn’t there this kind of reaction to the Panorama documentary? Barry McGuigan was the only person from boxing to appear in the programme. He spoke out and he was very brave. The reaction was just to attack Barry from within boxing rather than address Kinahan. There was no follow-up to say: ‘How is Kinahan involved in the sport? How do we get rid of this guy?’” Kinahan was an adviser, rather than the official manager, of all the fighters who defended him so passionately. He could not be banned or stripped of his influence by the British Boxing of Control because “advisers” – unlike fighters, trainers, managers and promoters – do not require a licence to operate. And so Kinahan became one of the most powerful men in boxing as he brokered world title fights and negotiated huge TV deals with other promoters. No one could avoid dealing with him. While Kinahan’s fighters taunted McGuigan on social media, thinly veiled threats were made against those involved in the Panorama documentary. “We all had to think about our safety but I personally wasn’t affected because we were more in the background,” Dempster says. “It was directed at Darragh MacIntyre [who presented the programme].” Cunningham also considered the dangers: “My wife, Peigi, asked me a couple of times not to cover this story. I sat down with her and said I have to stick with it. I told her lots of journalists on the crime beat cover this story. They don’t have invisible suits of armour and they’ve managed.” Boxing, meanwhile, trundled on. “I remember the day after Panorama was screened you spoke to Robert Smith from the British Boxing Board of Control,” Cunningham says. “He made it clear how limited their powers are to stop somebody like Kinahan. That should be a priority. Boxing has to put some process in place to stop another Kinahan coming into the sport.” Neither Cunningham nor Dempster hold out lasting hope that boxing will ever be regulated and they expect the rival sanctioning bodies to still focus on chaos and profit. Some insiders voiced concern to me that Kinahan might even be able to control boxing from a prison cell. But this week the landscape of boxing has clearly changed. MTK Global, the management company Kinahan set up in 2012, insist that they have had no links with him for five years. Yet they announced that they will cease trading at the end of April as other organisations now refuse to do business with them. Probellum, a separate company, have also refuted allegations that they are linked to Kinahan, but the Discovery Channel and Eurosport still decided this week not to screen their fight promotions. “Kinahan’s finished in boxing,” Dempster says. “If the Americans really want to get him, they will.” Cunningham, who is working on a four-part podcast series on Kinahan and boxing, agrees: “It’s the endgame for Kinahan. The Americans’ powers are so far-reaching they can freeze the bank accounts of any business seen to have a connection to Kinahan. Lots of people within boxing would be nervy because it’s a crisis for the sport. At the press conference they named some of the companies they’re investigating. The implication was that more will be named. “What really needs to change is the governance of boxing. The WBC in theory are the main governing body but their president, Mauricio Sulaimán, was singing Kinahan’s praises last month. This week he’s done a couple of U-turns. If these are the people we’re looking at as the guardians of the sport, what hope does boxing have?” Cunningham and Dempster hope that, somehow, boxing will change in the wake of this month’s seismic events. “During the Panorama investigation,” Dempster says, “we had a list of boxing gyms in England and we door-stepped professional trainers and fighters, as well as people in the grassroots. There were real salt-of-the-earth people who welcomed us in. But the first thing they said was: ‘We’ll talk to you, but we don’t want to go on the record.’ They were frightened of Kinahan and they didn’t want to rock the boat because he had so much power. These were good people who were disgusted, dismayed and depressed at his malign influence. I’ve been in touch with them over the last week. They’re relieved. I feel vindicated for them.”",Sport/Sport,‘A malign influence in boxing’: the downfall of Daniel Kinahan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/21/boxing-the-downfall-of-daniel-kinahan-malign-influence
4/22/2022,"Play was held up at the Invictus Games on Thursday by a late arrival to the wheelchair basketball. Jelle van der Steen, a mainstay of the Dutch national side, had to make a late withdrawal from the tournament after he was hit by illness and forced into surgery. But as his teammates prepared for tip-off in The Hague the former marine was escorted on to the court – in his hospital bed – so he could share the moment. The Netherlands went on to beat Canada 23-10. It was an incident that sums up the event, which is being staged this year for the fifth time. It sees former service people who experienced life-changing injuries in the line of duty compete in a number of adaptive sports. The Invictus Games is not short on spirit, endeavour or camaraderie, and in the Netherlands this spring – the event ends on Friday – it has grown in scale and prominence once again. In the UK, the BBC has been showing daily highlights. One of the hosts of the coverage, the former Invictus athlete JJ Chalmers, explained what he saw as the Games’ unique appeal. “I get to work on a number of crown jewel sports occasions like the Olympics and the Paralympics – but none of them really compare to this and I think the reason is because the medals are secondary,” he told British Forces Broadcasting. “In fact the sport is kind of secondary. All it is, is an excuse to get like-minded individuals from all over the world who have had similar experiences to share those experiences and rediscover themselves so that they can get that sense of service back again. “It’s about putting your country’s flag on your sleeve but also putting your best foot forward, representing your country and community and having an impact on society. I think the level of education [the public] can get from this, when people are brutally honest about the experiences they have had, is unique to the Invictus Games.” Team UK comprises 59 male and female athletes, selected and trained by the charity Help for Heroes. The selection criteria takes in performance metrics but also consideration of how an athlete’s physical – and mental – recovery from their injuries will be aided by participation. The captain of Team UK, the swimmer Rachel Williamson, suffered an injury in 2014 that caused her to lose the use of her right arm and led to a medical discharge from the RAF in 2016. A competitive swimmer in her youth, Williamson had once hoped of competing in the Olympics but feared she would never be able to swim again. However, she competed in the Invictus Games in Sydney in 2018 and won two gold medals in rowing and three silvers and a bronze in swimming. On Wednesday afternoon she won three gold medals and a silver in the pool, telling the BBC: “To finally represent my country is amazing, the medals are just a bonus. I just wanted to smile at the end and to prove that I can do it.” With 17 participating countries and 10 sports in competition, the growing success of the games is vindication for their founder, Prince Harry. Headlines have followed the 37-year-old throughout the week but not all of them have been controversial. He has been ubiquitous in his role as chief cheerleader at the Games and a photo of him on the court, clasping the hand of Van der Steen in his bed, may perhaps prove the defining image of the week.",Sport/Sport,‘No event compares’: the Invictus Games shows its fighting spirit again,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/21/no-event-compares-the-invictus-games-shows-its-fighting-spirit-again
4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson suffered humiliating blows to his authority after MPs backed a formal investigation to look at whether he lied to parliament, and senior party figures made new calls for him to resign. The prime minister will now be investigated by a Commons committee over claims he misled MPs about lockdown parties – a potential resigning matter under the ministerial code. The move came after the government tried to delay the inquiry only to make a U-turn hours later amid a backlash. Speaking during a Commons debate following chaotic scenes in Westminster, the former Brexit minister Steve Baker, an influential figure among Conservatives, said he was appalled by Johnson’s private attitude towards the fine he had received for breaches of Covid rules and said the prime minister “now should be long gone”. Others made clear that they had told Tory whips they would not block or delay a new Partygate inquiry. The Guardian can reveal that the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told constituents he had warned whips he would not support moves to delay the inquiry. Hunt said in an email to constituents that he found the fines issued to Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, “shocking and disappointing”. “We will also now see the privileges committee investigate whether parliament was lied to,” he wrote. “I made it clear to the government that I would not have supported any move to delay such an investigation had we been asked to. But in the end thankfully, we were not.” He said he would not make a final judgment until the end of the process but did not believe now was the “best time” to change prime minister. While other prime ministers had been removed in wartime, “in this situation we only have to ask ourselves, would Vladimir Putin be happy to see a two-month leadership contest in Britain?” Hunt added. The turbulence in Westminster threatened to overshadow the prime minister’s trade trip to India, where he toured Ahmedabad as MPs debated his political future for four hours on the floor of the Commons. Minutes before the debate about whether to refer Johnson to the privileges committee, government whips pulled their amendment – tabled on Wednesday evening – that would have delayed any vote on the investigation until after the final Sue Gray Partygate report was published. The Labour motion was passed on Thursday although the privileges committee investigation will not begin for weeks or months, once the police and Gray inquiries are complete. Johnson’s press secretary, speaking during a trip to India, sought to suggest the prime minister was relaxed about being referred to the privileges committee, with “no concerns”. At the Commons debate, William Wragg, chair of the Commons’ constitutional affairs committee, said he had written a letter of no confidence in the prime minister and that he would have rebelled if the government had not withdrawn its amendment. He said: “We have been working in a toxic atmosphere. The parliamentary party bears the scars of misjudgments of leadership. There can be few colleagues on this side of the house, I would contend, who are truly enjoying being members of parliament at the moment. It is utterly depressing to be asked to defend the indefensible. Each time part of us withers.” Steve Baker had previously told the Commons he had been prepared to forgive Johnson but said that the PM’s bullish approach to the fines, in a private meeting of the 1922 meeting of backbenchers this week, had changed his mind. He said Johnson’s contrition “only lasted as long as it took to get out of the headmaster’s study”. Baker added: “I have to say I’m sorry, that for not obeying the letter and spirit – and I think we have heard that the prime minister did know what the letter was – the prime minister now should be long gone. I’ll certainly vote for this motion. But really, the prime minister should just know the gig’s up.” Bob Neill, who chairs the justice committee, stopped short of calling for Johnson to go but said he had planned to abstain on the Labour motion. “I am profoundly disappointed in what happened at No 10. People were badly let down, my constituents feel badly let down, I feel personally badly let down and there must be consequences that follow from that,” he said. The Conservative MP Anthony Mangnall said he could not forgive Johnson for misleading the Commons. “I do forgive the prime minister for making those mistakes but I do not forgive him for misleading the house, as I see it.” Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chair of the Commons defence committee, who has already called for the prime minister to go, tweeted that it was time for his colleagues “to stop drinking the Kool Aid”. Opening the debate, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said it was imperative for MPs to judge if Johnson had deliberately misled them with his denials of Partygate lockdown breaches in Downing Street. Starmer said: “He has stood before this house and said things that are not true, safe in the knowledge that he will not be accused of lying. He has stood at that dispatch box and point blank denied rule-breaking took place, when it did. “As he did so, he was hoping to gain extra protection from our assumption, and from the public assumption, that no prime minister would deliberately mislead the house. He has used our good faith to cover up his misdeeds.” Speaking to reporters on his trade visit to India, Johnson said he had reversed his position on the amendment because he had “nothing to hide” but appeared irritated at Labour’s determination to continue pressing the issue. “People were saying it looks like we are trying to stop stuff. I didn’t want that. I didn’t want people to be able to say that. I don’t want this thing to endlessly go on,” he told Sky News. “But, I have absolutely nothing, frankly, to hide. If that is what the opposition want to talk about, that is fine.” Asked about Baker’s call for him to resign, Johnson said: “I understand people’s feelings. I don’t think that is the right thing to do.” He conceded the situation was serious, however. On Wednesday Tory whips had scrambled to find a way to block or delay the inquiry by the privileges committee. But MPs had privately and publicly asked whips not to give Labour the opportunity to paint them as taking part in a cover-up.",News/Politics,Authority of Boris Johnson damaged as own MPs say ‘gig’s up’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/authority-of-boris-johnson-damaged-as-own-mps-say-gigs-up
4/22/2022,"Lurking at the entrance to the House of Commons voting lobbies on Wednesday night, the government’s new chief whip stood clutching his phone, devising and rewriting a single sentence he hoped might save the prime minister the embarrassment of being investigated for allegedly misleading parliament. Chris Heaton-Harris quietly grappled with the text of an amendment that aimed to derail a Labour motion to trigger an inquiry by the Commons privileges committee into whether Johnson lied about rule-breaking in Downing Street. With a majority of 80, persuading Tory MPs to simply vote the motion down should not have been a hard task. But given the erosion of trust between the front and back benches after months of sleaze scandals, a frantic party management exercise got under way. When the Labour motion had dropped earlier that day, senior Tories were surprised at the craftiness of it, because the investigation would not be triggered until Scotland Yard’s own inquiry had concluded, giving Conservative MPs little reason not to support it. “They’re clearly on the ball,” said one Tory MP. Whips spent the afternoon hurrying between their offices and meetings with potentially problematic Conservative backbenchers who were considering supporting the motion. Heaton-Harris held personal sit-downs with the known rebels Mark Harper and Tom Tugendhat. Meanwhile, gleeful opposition party campaign strategists were mocking up adverts that would be used to target those Tories who voted to save Johnson from further scrutiny. The Liberal Democrats had already put together a leaflet with a picture of Johnson that read: “He lied and broke the law … but our area’s Conservative MP has let him off the hook!” As the afternoon wore on, Tory MPs began privately admitting they had run out of excuses for rejecting the investigation. They pressed for the prime minister to get on the front foot, avoid the inevitable and refer himself to the privileges committee. But they were stonewalled by No 10. Normal lines of communication between the government and opposition whips’ office fell silent. “They went into bunker mode,” one insider observed. MPs who sit on the privileges committee saw their inboxes balloon with emails from members of the public urging them to carry out a ruthless review of Johnson’s alleged lies in parliament. With the government running out of options, Labour figures felt triumphant. Then, less than an hour until the deadline for submitting an amendment before Commons business ended for the day, ministers pulled their rabbit out of the hat. They tabled a proposal to delay the decision about launching an inquiry until after the publication of the final Partygate report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, kicking the can even further down the road. Tory MPs who had been preparing to back or abstain on Labour’s motion to help it pass were quietly impressed that the government had managed to come up with what appeared to be an impressive “off ramp”. When they left parliament’s bars on Wednesday evening, many felt ready – and glad – to vote for it. But by the following morning, realisation had dawned on many Tory MPs that they would be seen by the public to be in effect supporting a wrecking amendment. Fearing a return to the cover-up claims that dogged the government for months over the Owen Paterson affair, MPs turned up the heat, and the number who threatened to rebel moved dangerously close to matching the number of the government’s majority. The next shift in the government’s position was let slip by Johnson himself, speaking on his second visit of the day during a trip to India. “The House of Commons can do whatever it wants to do,” he said, all but confirming that the three-line whip would be switched to a free vote. Heaton-Harris himself delivered the news to the minister in whose name the amendment was made, Mark Spencer, the leader of the Commons. After lobbying by the Conservative MP Charles Walker, Spencer confirmed the unthinkable – that the amendment the government had hung all its hopes on would fall by the wayside, and MPs would be allowed to vote with their conscience. The revelation came during a relatively under-attended session of Commons business questions, and the shock reverberated slowly through the building. An MP said staff burst into their office to tell them the news. The blame game followed swiftly. Many Tories complained they had been consulted for their views on the Labour motion but not the government’s amendment, meaning party whips were deaf to the criticisms against it. “It’s open mic night at the Dog and Duck and we’re looking for anyone with a shred of skill at party management,” an ex-cabinet minister smirked as they left the chamber. Another MP quipped that ditching the amendment “demonstrated a lack of discipline within the party, which speaks volumes”. The day ended – in the words of one Conservative MP – with a “huge anticlimax”. Some chose to stick around to watch the Labour motion pass. But most drifted wearily home early, ready to face the wrath of their constituents.",News/Politics,How senior Tories’ frantic efforts failed to block Boris Johnson inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/how-senior-tories-frantic-efforts-failed-to-block-boris-johnson-inquiry
4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson faces a fresh investigation over Partygate – this time over whether he misled MPs by repeatedly denying Covid laws were broken in Downing Street. The special body known as the committee of privileges looks into allegations that an MP has committed contempt of parliament. Misleading the Commons, as opposition parties have alleged Johnson has done, comes under this category. While the committee has conducted numerous investigations before, the sitting prime minister has never previously been referred to it for scrutiny. A cross-party group of seven MPs make up the committee. They are the exact same members as sit on the standards committee, given the two used to be combined until 2010. But unlike the standards committee, the privileges committee does not have any extra lay members – independent people who are not politicians – appointed to sit on it. There is an in-built government majority, with the four Conservative MPs consisting of Alberto Costa, Bernard Jenkin, Andy Carter and Laura Farris. Labour has two spots, held by Yvonne Fovargue and Chris Bryant, while the Scottish National party has one, Allan Dorans. It is one of only two committees that House of Commons rules dictate must have a Labour chair, currently occupied by Bryant. However, Bryant was a vocal critic of the government and Johnson over Partygate so has recused himself from the impending investigation. Jenkin, as the acting vice-chair, is expected to take his place. The motion that set up the investigation said committee members “shall not begin substantive consideration of the matter until the inquiries currently being conducted by the Metropolitan police have been concluded”. So while the committee may meet fairly soon to rubber stamp that they will act in accordance with the motion being passed, it will have relatively little to do until Scotland Yard’s inquiry, known as Operation Hillman, is completed. That is at least some weeks away, given the Met has said it will not provide any further updates until after the local elections on 5 May. The police investigation may well drag on longer, and MPs may also want to wait for the final report about the Whitehall investigation run by Sue Gray to be released. But the committee will look into something quite different from the other two investigations. It is not intended to examine the extent of law-breaking but whether Johnson deliberately misled parliament. Doing so is a cardinal offence, given the ministerial code that bears the prime minister’s signature states clearly that ministers who do so are expected to offer their resignation. The committee will have wide-ranging powers to call for papers and other evidential documents – such as photographs, which could prove particularly damning for Johnson – and summon witnesses. The difficulty they will face, though, is that it may prove tricky to prove without equivocation that Johnson knowingly misled parliament about his knowledge of law-breaking. After all the work has been completed, the committee can recommend a sanction – including suspension or expulsion of an MP from parliament. Crucially, whatever sanction is recommended would need the approval of the Commons. So some allies of Johnson still believe he would have a chance of surviving. Though others argue that voting down the recommendations of a cross-party committee tasked with looking through all the evidence would be politically impossible.",News/Politics,What is the Commons privileges committee and how powerful is it?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/what-is-the-commons-privileges-committee-and-how-powerful-is-it
4/22/2022,"The prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine is a key factor behind Finland’s debate over whether to join Nato, the country’s foreign minister has said. Pekka Haavisto is having a busy few weeks. As Finland’s foreign minister, Haavisto, 64, may soon oversee the biggest political shift the country has experienced since it joined the EU almost three decades ago. “Finland is currently making its choices. And among those choices, Nato membership is one,” Haavisto told the Guardian in an interview on Thursday. Yesterday, the Finnish parliament started its much-anticipated debate over the possibility of submitting a membership bid to Nato. Recent polls have shown a dramatic U-turn in public opinion in Finland, with the majority now favouring joining Nato after the invasion of Ukraine. “Our security environment has dramatically changed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February,” the veteran Green party politician said. Haavisto proceeded to list the conclusions Finland has drawn about its big neighbour that have led to the political debates in his country. Moscow has shown its willingness to take increasing risks in its military operations and demonstrated its ability to quickly mobilise more than 100,000 soldiers against a neighbouring country without conducting a general mobilisation. “Russia’s behaviour is more unpredictable, and it is ready to take higher risks than earlier. If we look at Georgia in 2008 or Crimea in 2014, we could say that in those cases, Russia took calculated risks,” the minister said, referring to the war in Georgia and the annexation of Crimea. “What is different now is that we see that Russia’s original purpose when attacking Ukraine was to change the regime in a country of 40 million people. This is a high-risk operation for Russia, but Russia showed it was ready to take those risks.” Haavisto said he was also deeply troubled by reports that Russia could use nuclear weapons in Ukraine as its military continues to struggle. “For Russia’s neighbours, the country’s loose talk on the use of unconventional weapons, including tactical nuclear weapons and chemicals, is very uncomfortable. “This is a really concerning issue for us. This has triggered talk in Finland about our own security position in Europe.” Western intelligence officials have started to publicly warn that the Kremlin might turn to tactical or other limited nuclear weapons from its arsenal if its invasion of Ukraine continues to flounder. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that these fears were also shared by some senior Russian officials and senior managers of state-run businesses. Russia, which has previously denied planning a military operation against Ukraine, has stated its commitment to avoiding nuclear war. However, on Wednesday, Moscow test-launched its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new addition to its nuclear arsenal, which President Vladimir Putin said would give Moscow’s enemies “something to think about”. Haavisto said that, for the first time in his long political career, Finns “on the streets” are concerned with the “nuclear” question. “A typical question that I now get from people on the streets or in the shops, which I did not have during my whole political life, is what Finland will do if it is threatened by nuclear or chemical weapons. As a politician, you have to have an answer for that,” he said. That Finland, a country that traditionally maintained dialogue with the Kremlin, is openly raising the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons indicates just how much of a threat the west perceives the country to be after its invasion of Ukraine. The popular president of the Nordic state, Sauli Niinistö – often described as the “Putin whisperer” due to his direct line to the Kremlin – had been engaged in long conversations trying to persuade the Russian president not to invade Ukraine. Haavisto now shrugged that it was “a big disappointment that Russia chose the military way in Ukraine” despite the Finnish efforts. The minister said Finland has kept its diplomatic channels open with Russia during the war, and he pointed to Niinistö’s call with Putin on 10 March as one of the ways his country was trying to get Putin to the negotiating table. Finland is expected to make a decision on whether to apply for Nato membership within the next few weeks, and it will take between four and 12 months for the 30 members of the alliance to formally accept the country. “In that period, we are prepared for all kinds of [Russian] disturbances, cyber-attacks, hybrid attacks and so forth. It is just something you have to be prepared for,” Haavisto said. On Wednesday, much discussion in the Helsinki parliament centred around the changes the country will see if it becomes part of the defensive bloc, given Finland’s 830-mile shared border with Russia. “I think Nato’s basic idea is this common and shared security that gets activated in a time of crisis, in a time of conflict you get help from the other members,” said Haavisto, adding that Finland intends to maintain conscription and its reserve of 280,000 soldiers. “But in the time of peace, I cannot see a major change in our defence … Russia is and will always be our neighbour. We have always appreciated a peaceful border, we would like to keep it that way.”",News/World news,Prospect of Russia using nuclear arms in Ukraine fuels Finland’s Nato debate ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/russia-nuclear-weapons-fuels-finland-nato-debate
4/22/2022,"Amber Heard finally got her chance to challenge Johnny Depp’s version of their marriage in court on Thursday as her legal team pressed the actor on his alcohol and drug use, and texts in which he described wanting to kill his then-wife and defile her body. The cross-examination by Heard’s attorneys followed two days of unopposed testimony by Depp, in which the actor painted Heard as the aggressor in their three-year marriage. Depp, 58, has accused Heard of defaming him with false accusations that ruined his reputation and career; Heard, 36, is counter-suing for $100m, claiming that she told the truth and that her opinion was protected free speech when she wrote that she was as a “public figure representing domestic abuse” in a 2018 Washington Post article. The issue for each is credibility, as each has attempted to shred the other’s. At the start of the legal showdown in Fairfax, Virginia, ten days ago, Heard’s attorneys said Depp physically and sexually assaulted her while abusing drugs and alcohol. On Thursday they followed up, asking Depp about text messages he shared with the actor Paul Bettany, singers Patti Smith and Marilyn Manson (real name Brian Warner), as well as his doctor and chief of security Stephen Deuters. In several of the messages, Depp used the term “monster” to describe the person he became under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The court heard damning exchanges from 2013 and 2014 between Depp and Bettany in which he described his desire to harm Heard: “Let’s drown her before we burn her!!!” he wrote, and said he would defile her corpse “afterwards to make sure she’s dead”. As Depp brought the action, the legal burden is his to show that Heard defamed him when she described herself as a domestic abuse survivor. Heard has admitted to hitting Depp on a recording played in court during which she said she struck Depp but didn’t “deck” him. In another exhibit, jurors were shown a photograph of Depp asleep after a 17-hour work day when he was also taking opioids. Heard’s attorney Ben Rottenborn asked Depp if he was aware of the lengths to which Heard went to help him, and played the court an audio recording in which she expressed concern that her husband might choke on his own vomit if left unattended. “She didn’t like it when it was her perception that I was high on drugs and alcohol,” Depp said during Thursday’s testimony. Heard’s lawyers argue that Depp has no credibility when he denies abusing Heard as he often drank and used drugs to the point of blacking out. To that purpose, Heard’s lawyers introduced text messages from Elton John, who was in 2013 helping Depp get sober during the early stages of his romance with Heard. Depp wrote to the singer describing his ex-wife Vanessa Paradis as a “French extortionist” who, he said, would seek to brainwash his new girlfriend against him. The court also listened to a recording of Depp moaning during a now infamous flight from Boston to Los Angeles. Depp later texted Bettany to say that he drank “all night before I picked Amber up to fly to LA this past Sunday. Ugly, mate. No food for days. Powders. Half a bottle of Whiskey, a thousand Red Bull and vodkas, pills, 2 bottles of Champers on plane”. Depp has previously testified that he drank only a glass of Champagne as he boarded the plane and, after taking two painkillers, locked himself in the plane’s bathroom and went to sleep to avoid Heard’s badgering. Jurors have also been shown a box in which Depp allegedly kept cocaine and several large bags of marijuana. In his text message to Patti Smith, Depp said he was “so disappointed in myself” after a visit to New York City in 2014 in which he got drunk and fought with Heard before they were married the following year. Heard’s lawyers have sought to show that Depp’s loss of work, including being dropped from Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, came before her 2018 opinion piece. They argue that the damage to Depp’s professional reputation was due to his own behavior. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

4/22/2022,"Even when he’s caught red-handed Boris Johnson can’t stop himself from lying. It’s pathological. Reckless, even. The closer he gets to the end of his political career, the more outlandish the untruth. There’s not even the doubtful glamour of burning up like some latter day Don Giovanni. At least the Don recognised his own failings and embraced his immorality. The Convict gives no sign of being able to manage the basics of distinguishing between right and wrong. His narcissism and entitlement is total. He lives in a bubble, enabled by the nodding donkeys who surround him. Only on Wednesday night had Johnson ordered the paymaster general, Michael Ellis – a man who lives for the public humiliation, “kick me, please, harder, harder!”, of defending the indefensible in the Commons – to come up with an amendment to frustrate and delay Labour’s motion that there should be an inquiry into claims the prime minister misled parliament. Ellis duly did as he was asked and Tory MPs were told there was a three-line whip for them to back the amendment. And the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, was sent out on the media round to make a fool of himself. Something he usually manages all on his own with no help from anyone else. Then the whips started doing the maths and realised that, despite the Convict having a working majority of 75, they didn’t have the numbers to guarantee the amendment being passed. When the chips are down, there are fewer and fewer Tories willing to stake their careers on Johnson’s probity. Most aren’t dumb enough to be seen to actively block any investigation. They can see the writing on the wall. And it’s got Johnson’s name on it. So after Charles Walker, one of the more gentle Tory MPs, had used Thursday’s business statement to ask the government to have a rethink – he also rather deludedly described Johnson as “an honest and decent man”, not even Boris’s friends would go that far – the Commons leader later announced that the amendment would be dropped and that the Tories would be given a free vote on the opposition motion. At which point the Convict, who was on hols in India lecturing Gandhi on the virtues of telling the truth, declared to the hacks who were with him that he’d never wanted the amendment, that he’d never had anything to do with it and that he welcomed the inquiry he’s tried to delay. Breathtaking, even by his standards. All of which took some of the heat out of the debate that followed. Even so it was a damning and demeaning few hours for what’s left of Johnson’s reputation. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday we had seen Keir Starmer fuelled by hatred and contempt for a man hell-bent on dragging the country down to his level. Now we got a more statesman-like, more measured, Starmer. A man demanding to be heard in silence by both sides of the house. You got the feeling that even the Tories could start to see him as the next prime minister. After apologising for having believed what the prime minister’s spokesman had told the Daily Telegraph about the BBC, Starmer tried to use the occasion to rise above party politics. What was at stake was more important than that. Labour did not have a monopoly on the truth, but it was incumbent on everyone to defend the principles of parliamentary democracy. If lying became the norm then it demeans us all. And the Labour leader was in no doubt that the Convict had lied; he had lied at the dispatch box about parties in Downing Street, relying on the good faith of opposition MPs in not calling him a liar to wriggle free. So now it was up to parliament to put right what the Tory party would not. All opposition MPs made speeches that were variations on the same theme. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, made the most of the speaker’s temporary dispensation on unparliamentary language to repeatedly call the Convict a liar and to point out that the Tories had known his character when they had made him their leader. Though when Blackford mentioned that Johnson had lied to the Queen over the prorogation, that was too much for Lindsay Hoyle. The Queen might never recover from the idea the UK had a bent prime minister. Labour’s Chris Bryant also spoke powerfully about democratic values, though was rather too quick to give Johnson credit for at least partially admitting his wrongdoing. Only that morning, Boris had insisted he hadn’t even unknowingly misled parliament. The real interest in the debate focused on the few Tory MPs who had bothered to turn up. Most had wisely stayed away. Some, such as Bob Neill, merely vocalised their deep unhappiness but preferred to let others deliver the coup de grace on the Convict’s premiership. Baby-faced assassin William Wragg was once such Conservative. He reiterated his lack of support for the prime minister and declared that no Tory MP could be enjoying their job at the moment. Steve Baker began by quoting Romans from the Bible, before going full old testament. He had been willing to believe Boris had repented up until the time he heard his lack of contrition in Tuesday’s 1922 Committee. So it was time for him to go. Vengeance will be his. Of the backbenchers, only Danny Kruger offered wholehearted support. He knew Boris hadn’t lied because he had delivered Brexit. Which qualified him for idiot of the day. Dim Danny hasn’t yet learned that Johnson lied through his teeth to get Brexit done. And still is doing so. It was left to Unctuous Ellis to wind up the debate for the government. And he wasted no time in thoroughly debasing himself. A man has to take his pleasures where he finds them. The fact that he had been left out to dry by the government’s U-turn only made it more arousing for him. The prime minister had only ever tabled the amendment so that he could almost immediately withdraw it, he purred. The Convict had apologised profusely. And he couldn’t comment on any other apologies Johnson might be forced to make. That was above his pay grade. But why couldn’t everyone just recognise that Johnson was a latter-day saint. More sinned against than sinner. By the close, Ellis was just an oil-slick on the Commons carpet and the vote went through on the nod. Another nail in Johnson’s coffin. And a sign that even Tory MPs have some standards of decency in public life.",News/Politics,"The maths done, the Partygate amendment sank as MPs shrank from the indefensible",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/the-maths-done-the-partygate-amendment-sank-as-mps-shrank-from-the-indefensible
4/22/2022,"Joe Biden has announced $800m (£613m) in new arms supplies to Ukraine and said he will go to Congress to ask for more funding to help fend off the renewed Russian offensive in the east and south. The new US weapon deliveries will include 72 howitzers and their towing vehicles along with 144,000 artillery rounds and more than 120 drones tailored for Ukraine’s needs. “We’re in a critical window of time when [the Russians] are going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said. “And the United States and our allies and partners are moving as fast as possible to continue to provide Ukraine the weapons their forces need to defend their nation.” Fifty Ukrainian artillery officers are being given a week-long course by US instructors on the use of US 155mm howitzers in an unnamed European country, the Pentagon said. Biden said the latest arms supplies with the emphasis on heavy artillery reflected the requirements of the different landscape of the Donbas, which is largely flat agricultural land, compared with the forests around Kyiv, providing fewer opportunities for ambushes and guerrilla warfare. The president said the US had so far given Ukraine 10 anti-tank missiles, including Javelins, for every tank Russia has on the battlefield, along with armoured cars, armed drones and other heavy equipment, and was playing the role of facilitator for arms deliveries from other countries. “We won’t always be able to advertise everything that our partners are doing to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom,” Biden said, and he paraphrased a famous quote of Theodore Roosevelt: “Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin.” The new type of drone the US will deliver to Ukraine is named the Phoenix Ghost and has been developed specifically for Ukraine by the US air force with a California company, Aevex Aerospace. The Pentagon gave few details about the drone, but a defence department official was quoted by Breaking Defense as saying it was a “one-way drone” that “delivers a punch”, suggesting it is a kamikaze flying bomb similar to the Switchblade drones the US has already delivered. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was quick to express gratitude for US “leadership in supporting the people of Ukraine in the fight against Russian aggression”. He said on Twitter: “This help is needed today more than ever! It saves the lives of our defenders of democracy and freedom and brings us closer to restoring peace in Ukraine.” Zelenskiy was visited in Kyiv on Thursday by the Spanish and Danish prime ministers, Pedro Sánchez and Mette Frederiksen, who pledged new military supplies from their countries. Sánchez promised 200 tonnes of equipment including heavy transport vehicles and ammunition, which he said was Spain’s “largest shipment made until now, more than doubling what we have sent so far.” Frederiksen said her country would increase the scale of its weapons contribution to Ukraine by 600m Danish krone (£67m). The new US arms delivery brings Washington’s total military support since the start of the war to more than $3bn. Congress approved a $13.6bn package of military and humanitarian aid in March and Biden said he expected to go back to ask for more next week. “My hope and my expectation is that Congress would move and act quickly,” he said, thanking Democrats and Republicans for their support for Ukraine funding. Asked how much he would ask for this time, Biden replied: “That’s being decided now. I’m asking the defence department to put together what they think we need.” Biden also announced a new $500m disbursement of economic support for Ukraine, a new fast-track route for Ukrainian refugees to come to the US from Europe, and the next step in ratcheting up sanctions on Moscow – a ban on Russian ships visiting US ports. “That means no ship … that sails under the Russian flag, or that is owned or operated by Russian interests, will be allowed to dock in the United States port or access our shores. None,” he said. Daniel Tannenbaum, a former US Treasury sanctions compliance official, said enforcing the ban would be challenging. “There has been evidence that they’ve been changing flags over the last few weeks, not sure how much impact this will have,” he said, adding that making the measure effective would require sleuthing into the real ownership of ships sailing under flags of convenience. The UK in its latest raft of sanctions announced it would ban imports of Russian caviar and other luxury goods, as well as silver and wood products. Tariffs on diamonds and rubber imports from Russia and Belarus will be increased by 35%. The UK’s international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: “We are taking every opportunity we can to ratchet the pressure to isolate the Russian economy and these further measures will tighten the screws, shutting down lucrative avenues of funding for Putin’s war machine.”",News/World news,Joe Biden announces $800m in new arms supplies to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/joe-biden-announces-800m-in-new-arms-supplies-to-ukraine
4/22/2022,"First the Conservatives opposed the motion. Then they went along with it. Next they tried to amend it. Then they pulled their own amendment. In the end, and after a procedurally chaotic day at Westminster, Tory MPs stayed quiet and nodded the opposition motion through. The formal result is that the committee of privileges will examine whether Boris Johnson misled parliament about Downing Street’s lockdown parties. The informal result is that Mr Johnson has again lost control of his party and perhaps this time lost its confidence too. Amid the confusion of the preceding 48 hours, three things stand out. First, Mr Johnson is now further than ever from shaking off partygate. Second, the supposedly improved Downing Street machine is another write-off. And third, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who made one of his best speeches on Thursday, has won a significant victory. For the Tories, by contrast, the success of the Labour motion provided an abject climax to an abject day. It was a day that laid bare the true depth of Conservative divisions over Mr Johnson’s leadership. It exposed the enduring vulnerability of the party while he remains leader. It inflicted even more reputational harm to an already damaged parliament. Worst of all, from the point of view of Mr Johnson’s own narrow self-interest, it made things even worse politically than they already were. Politically, this is a form of living death. Damning speeches from his own side from MPs such as Steve Baker and William Wragg were important evidence of the increasingly despairing Tory mood. But so was the extraordinary emptiness of the Tory benches, with almost no one speaking up for their damaged leader and few party MPs even bothering to attend. The Tory party that had once turned to him in 2019 is now shot through with unhappiness about their leader. As long as he remains, there will be even more of it. Mr Johnson never had the support in the first place of the relatively few liberal Tories who remain. Many in the parliamentary ranks have deep misgivings too. Significantly, the prime minister is now also being abandoned by some on the right, like Mr Baker, who had stood by him until now. Although he was in India on Thursday, continuing to act as though the argument at home is a sideshow, Mr Johnson will know that his position is eroding, that the bell is tolling more loudly, and that Mr Starmer is remorselessly hunting him down. The day had begun with the Tory hierarchy focused on passing a delaying amendment to Labour’s motion referring Mr Johnson’s Commons statements on lockdown parties to the privileges committee. Labour’s motion was drafted in moderate terms and held out a hand to Tory critics of the prime minister by promising to delay the referral until the end of the police investigations. Late on Wednesday, the government put down an amendment to extend the delay still further. By Thursday morning it was clear that many dozens of Tory MPs would not vote for it and there would be a free vote on the Tory side. As with the Owen Paterson affair, Mr Johnson led his party unerringly into the mire. Public indignation about his lockdown parties, plus the inexorable worsening of the cost-of-living crisis, means that there is no quick fix for the Conservatives. British voters now believe that the government is handling almost every issue badly – by ratios of more than three to one in the case of inflation, taxation, immigration, housing and the NHS. Only 20% think Mr Johnson understands the impact of the cost-of-living increases on ordinary people. These are the figures of a broken leader and a wounded party. Mr Johnson’s prime ministership is again hanging by a thread.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson: hanging on by a thread | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/21/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-hanging-on-by-a-thread
4/22/2022,"Before Wednesday evening’s traditional presidential debate, Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen drew lots to decide who would speak first and on which theme. Having won this preliminary contest, Ms Le Pen chose to open with the cost-of-living crisis – the hot campaign topic that has helped her to successfully normalise her public image and bring French far-right politics in from the cold. That minor victory was probably as good as it got for the National Rally (formerly National Front) leader. As in 2017, Mr Macron proved himself a far more proficient debater with a better grasp of policy detail. He also embarrassed his opponent by repeatedly highlighting her party’s links to dubious Russian money following a bank loan taken out in 2014. Ms Le Pen maintained her composure and kept her temper – in contrast to five years ago – but emerged the clear loser on the night. Ahead of Sunday’s second-round runoff vote, this constitutes another reason for moderate French voters to be cheerful. After a hair-raising period in which the race appeared to be on a knife-edge, the most recent polls suggest Mr Macron has established a double-digit lead over Ms Le Pen. Concessions on unpopular policies such as raising the retirement age have helped. Ms Le Pen’s determination to ban the hijab in public places, a pledge on which she doubled down in the debate, will help Mr Macron persuade hesitant Muslim voters to turn out for him at the weekend. A mood of complacency, however, would be unjustified on two levels. Sunday’s vote could well see a record rate of abstention, as younger voters in particular stay at home. That in itself indicates a worrying degree of disillusionment, but the latest polling suggests that just under half of those planning not to vote may change their mind on the day, making a close outcome still possible. More fundamentally, if Ms Le Pen wins 40% of the vote or more, it will still be a landmark breakthrough for the French far right, with far-reaching implications. In the heart of the European Union, in one of its largest and most influential member states, an authoritarian nationalist programme would effectively have been legitimised. Throughout the campaign, Ms Le Pen has downplayed the far-right themes that made her family’s name, but they continue to constitute the menacing core of her ambitions. Her proposal for a referendum on “citizenship, immigration and identity”, aimed at instituting a suite of nativist “French first” policies, would generate a constitutional crisis and turn France into a rogue EU state. A ban on veils in public settings would make France an outlier among democracies and foment civil conflict in its already tense banlieues. The domestic strife caused by a Le Pen presidency would be complemented abroad by the disruption of western unity at a crucial moment. Having taken his eye off the ball while focusing on events in Ukraine, Mr Macron has rediscovered the focus that helped deliver a landslide 30-point victory against Ms Le Pen in 2017. But Sunday’s race will be closer, whatever the final result. Finding out why will be a crucial part of the postmortem to come.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Macron v Le Pen: no room for complacency | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/21/the-guardian-view-on-macron-v-le-pen-no-room-for-complacency
