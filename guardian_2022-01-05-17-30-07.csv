1/5/2022,"As openings go, it was at the subtler end of the bang-whimper spectrum. So subtle, in fact, that the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain’s first concert of 2022 began before most of the packed auditorium noticed. What sounded like pre-performance doodlings among the double basses and percussion suddenly cohered into a heavy tread of repeated notes and rhythmic filigree. As the rest of the orchestra filed on stage, the standard-issue minimalism (shades of Terry Riley’s In C) blossomed into more colourful textures. And then it all dissipated as mysteriously as it had begun, leaving the principal oboe playing a sustained A for tuning. There was no conductor and no music. Just, as we were told in one of multiple spoken cameos from players, the NYO’s trademark “unashamedly enthusiastic atmosphere”. Such devised pieces are now a regular feature: a reminder of how much the organisation provides for its members beyond high-level orchestral training. (Though nothing encapsulates the scale of Operation NYO better than their gargantuan pre-concert pizza order, which arrived as I did.)  If the main body of the concert seemed more subdued than some NYO appearances, that’s surely because it was this cohort’s first outing, after a single week together. But the quality of playing under the careful, encouraging leadership of Sian Edwards was largely as polished as ever. Ravel’s La Valse emerged from barely-there rustles, taking flight in irresistibly brash climaxes. The middle movement of Karim Al-Zand’s City Scenes wove delicate skeins of percussion and strings, while Dani Howard’s Coalescence showcased on-the-money brass and exquisitely blended polychrome shimmer. Best of all were Rachmaninoff’s Symphonic Dances, which boasted a gorgeously mellow saxophone and tender strings, liquid ripples of woodwind and a muscular, sharply chiselled finale – and there’s no full orchestral sound quite like an NYO tutti, as this huge, energetic machine roars joyously into life.

1/5/2022,"On the back of encouraging polls – including one that eliminated the Tory lead on the economy – Keir Starmer started the new year with a speech linking the months of Tory corruption and incompetence to a wider argument about Britain. Though the Labour leader is surely correct to acknowledge that his party can’t just rely on Tory collapse, there is some way to go to turn the headings of security, prosperity and respect into something that can capture the public imagination.  Tucked away near the start of his speech was a small reference to the other Keir, Hardie, in the context of a point about patriotism. “The Labour party is a deeply patriotic party. Keir Hardie once said that British socialism must ‘wear a local garb’. He meant that British socialism was rooted in the everyday concerns of working people.” But while Hardie’s socialism was quoted, we heard no more from the present Keir about his own. It is something he must address but seems reluctant to. In an interview last month, Starmer was asked whether he was a socialist. He refused to say, asking “what does that mean?”, moving quickly past the question. It was a strange response.Each Labour leader has had to define where they stood in relation to socialism. Labour was established through an alliance including trade unionists and socialists. Through clause IV of its constitution it was committed to a form of widespread common ownership. Leading figures from all parts of the party have argued about what socialism is. That contested nature is a reflection of its role in the political life of the party.There are two broad considerations that flow from Starmer’s answer. One is the perennial need to engage with and answer what is, or should be, a central question; and it is worth noting that leaders from the party’s centre and right have done so to further their own purposes as much as the left. Answering it, with certainty and clarity, certainly need not be a barrier to electoral success.But, the other is that the crises of the 21st century – the pandemic and climate – surely cry out for a politics based on socialism.Reaction to Starmer’s positioning was not limited to Labour’s left. The commentator John Rentoul, hardly a proselytist for the left, argued that he ought to have answered “yes, of course”, and then should have defined what socialism means to him.The Labour leader’s answer was particularly unusual because in 2020, he had set out his view of socialism in a Guardian article. “If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right,” he argued, adding: “We can win again if we make the moral case for socialism, a moral socialism, that is relevant to people’s everyday lives and the challenges we face as we move into the 2020s and 2030s.”I took part in the discussion that preceded the publication of Starmer’s article. There was never any question that such a statement of political values was unnecessary or a hostage to fortune. It was a function of being a senior Labour politician that you set out a wider philosophy. His was not everyone’s view of socialism. But in a sense, it was his attempt to answer in advance the question put to him more recently. That “moral socialism” piece, so carefully thought through, makes the Labour leader’s subsequent non-answer all the more perplexing. Why resile from it?Perhaps Labour’s leadership is inclined to avoid anything that nods to the wider left. Yet all Labour leaders, left and right, have to resolve their approach to socialism. Ed Miliband said he was bringing it back. Tony Blair’s replacement for clause IV declared “the Labour party is a democratic socialist party”. Neil Kinnock, well versed in the language of the labour movement, was interviewed for Marxism Today, whose analysis was seen to be of use to a Labour leader moving the party rightwards.Some may say that any talk of socialism is a turn-off, but no one is so naive as to believe that Labour ought to fight the next election with socialism as its slogan. Jeremy Corbyn’s overarching platform was not “vote Labour for socialism”, but “for the many not the few”.People will vote for left politicians of every stripe because their stances and policies connect to the direct interests and values of the voters. The challenge is to work out how to apply socialist ideas in order to advance at an electoral level.Our times demand more, not less, socialism. Polling consistently shows high levels of support for socialism among young people – to the alarm of rightwing analysts. Even among the wider population, including in the US, positive and negative views of capitalism and socialism poll closely together.More importantly, the free market has offered no solutions to the most fundamental aspects of the present pandemic. The state has had to intervene, massively and repeatedly. Ninety-seven per cent of the funding for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine came from the public sector and charities, for example. The vaccines would have been impossible without the state.Gordon Brown’s demand for global action to end the scandal of undervaccination around the world should remind us that this is an unequal planet, organised to the benefit of a relatively small number of rich countries. A socialist view looks at the contending class interests in society. In any given situation socialists will ask, who pays?So it is with the fallout of this pandemic. No new furlough for the Omicron wave has left huge numbers of workers in the lurch. The TUC highlighted the worst Christmas wage squeeze in nearly a decade. Many key workers, having seen the economy through the phases of the pandemic, can now expect a pay cut. The Treasury’s case that public sector pay settlements should not keep pace with inflation equates to a real-terms reduction.The pandemic has seen our society gripped by questions long-raised by socialists: internationalism, collectivism, inequality, class interests, planning, public ownership and state intervention versus the free market. The same applies to the climate crisis. Labour appears reluctant, but it simply must engage with where it stands on socialism. It is just over 30 years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. At the time, many on the right hoped that seismic event would also mean the end for a politics that looked to a future beyond capitalism. It was never likely then, and the twin global challenges of Covid-19 and climate emergency must surely lead to the opposite conclusion now.

1/5/2022,"“I’ve just looked through my 2021 Arsenal calendar before throwing it out,” begins Gordon Forbes. “Mr May, William Saliba, has made zero appearances for the club during 2021. Is there a higher profile calendar participant out there who did not play for his club during that same year?” We’ll deal with that question shortly but first let’s allow Gordon to show his workings: “Thanks mainly to Saliba (0,0 subs), Willian (eight,12 sub), Maitland-Niles (five, nine sub), David Luiz (16, one sub) and Héctor Bellerín (17, one sub) and with the post-summer contributions of Bernd Leno, Granit Xhaka, Kieran Tierney and Pépé I estimate that all 12 players in the calendar have only filled 306 of the 784 available places (starting XIs and all substitutions) during 2021. At 39% of available playing spots, is this indeed the most unrepresentative club calendar ever?”  That additional question might be one for readers to answer next week but, thanks to the January transfer window, we have found a few examples that help answer the original question. Any Liverpool fans who had the club’s official 2018 calendar would have seen Philippe Coutinho staring at them from the wall in January, a month in which he never played for the club and left for Barcelona for around £142m. Similarly, Virgil van Dijk features in a composite image on the January page of Southampton’s 2018 offering having been confirmed as a Liverpool player on New Year’s Day. Andy Carroll was Newcastle’s Mr February on their 2011 wallchart having played the last game of his first stint at his boyhood club on 27 December 2010 before joining Liverpool. And two years later Demba Ba was the face of January 2013, a month in which he was in fine form … for Chelsea. We have also unearthed a few calendar-appearing one-match wonders. Fikayo Tomori was pictured alongside Reece James for August in Chelsea’s official 2021 calendar, meaning his club appearances (one in the FA Cup on 10 January against Morecambe) matched those on the wallchart thanks to a loan move to Milan on 22 January that became a permanent transfer. And Wes Morgan (January on Leicester’s 24-player 2021 calendar) made just one appearance – for eight minutes in the Foxes’ victorious FA Cup final win over Chelsea – last year while Christian Fuchs (May) similarly played just once – 15 minutes in the Cup against Brighton – in 2021. In our festive edition we detailed teams who had a remarkable turnaround in results after 25 December, and Ásgeir Ingólfsson has a great example from the land of fire and ice. “Concerning second half of the season meltdowns from leagues further afield, I present to you Þróttur from the Icelandic league. In the 2003 season they were top of the table at the halfway point with 18 points from nine games. They got only four points from the other nine games and ended up relegated (ninth out of 10 teams), despite being third as late as after the 14th round. In addition, they had two out of the three top scorers that summer.” Yes, they have Richard. “Dennis Greene left Boston after an abandoned FA Trophy tie at Witton Albion (having been losing 1-0 at half time),” writes Christian James. “We had lost 9-2 the week before.” And Alun Thomas has this: “Not an abandoned game, but Sunderland sacked Malcolm Crosby in February 1993 after the pools panel ruled they had lost a postponed game away to Tranmere.” “Brighton and Hove Albion v Wolverhampton Wanderers must be a contender for the longest fixture possible in the English leagues, in terms of letters used (43 letters excluding ‘v’). Any advance?” asks Tom Biltcliffe. It would appear to be the longest meeting of two clubs from the four professional leagues in England, Tom, but if we dip into the lower leagues we can find a lengthier matchup. “Havant & Waterlooville v Hampton & Richmond Borough in the National League South beats it by a character; even more (48) if you spell out the ampersands in full as with Brighton and Hove Albion,” writes Steve Hyde. “I know Tom’s question was aimed at English leagues but if you expand it to include Scottish leagues, you can have Inverness Caledonian Thistle v Dunfermline Athletic (45 characters),” offers Adam Anderson. “A potential early round Scottish Cup clash between ICT and Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic (Scottish Lowland League), would also produce 47 characters.” “Dundalk scored after 12 seconds in the League of Ireland … after their opponents Derry had taken the kick-off,” wrote Sam Alanson in September 2014. “Is this the quickest goal ever scored by a team who didn’t kickoff?” The short answer to this question is, no. But we had several responses from which we have permed the following quickfire top four, including the fastest goals in the entire history of the FA Cup, the Champions League and the World Cup: 9 seconds: Roda v Den Haag, October 2011. Den Haag took the lead nine seconds after the home side took the kick-off, but it didn’t help them much: they lost the game 5-2. Thanks to Stephan Wijnen for the tip-off. 9 seconds: Reading v West Brom, February 2010. “Nine seconds was all it took for the home side to seize the lead,” we reported. “Albion had kicked off and the ball was fed swiftly to right-back Gianni Zuiverloon, but the Dutchman dallied, allowing Jimmy Kébé to pilfer possession and then guide a low shot under the goalkeeper.” Hat-tip to Adam Roberts for the reminder. 10.12 seconds. Bayern Munich v Real Madrid, March 2007. Hat-tip to Joe Foley for this one. Roy Makaay’s goal remains the fastest in the Champions League, and as an added bonus it contributed to eliminating Madrid from the Champions League. 10.80 seconds. South Korea v Turkey, July 2002. The World Cup third-place play-off, Hong Myung-bo is a little bit too relaxed with his first touch, and Hakan Sukur pounces. Yaad Ilani suggested that one. “What is the largest goal tally for two teams combined drawing in both their home and away fixtures in a season? I presume there are examples of say 3-3 and 4-4 but are there any really big tallies where they just got two points?” asks John McDougall. “I was interested to read that Celtic captain Callum McGregor has won all 14 of the finals that he’s played in for the Hoops,” writes David Shearan. “Has anyone bettered this record?” Has a match played on December 31st ever run so late that it finished in the new year? Or has a match started and ended in different calendar years for any other reason? “Raheem Sterling has scored 18 goals for England, all in competitive matches,” notes Yasin Uddin. “Are there other players with similar records and which player has the highest number of international goals without padding their stats in friendlies?” Now that I think about it, probably one for @TheKnowledge_GU https://t.co/5yC8HbAfSr With Dover bottom of the National League on -8 points, having played half their games and therefore on course to only reach -4 by the end of the season, I was wondering if a team has ever ended a season on negative points? And if several have, what’s the highest league to see it? “Porto have won the Primeira Liga 29 times, and the main domestic cup 17 times, but are yet to win the Portuguese League Cup (which admittedly only began in 2007) having lost four finals,” writes Niall McVeigh. “Are there other examples of trophy-laden teams with a drought in one particular domestic competition?”  Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",Sport/Football,Footballers appearing on calendars in years they never played for the club | The Knowledge,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/footballers-appearing-on-calendars-in-years-they-never-played-for-the-club-knowledge
1/5/2022,"In a bowling alley somewhere in postapocalyptic rural America, a 10-year-old savant is celebrating his birthday. His mother has chosen this moment to tell him, via the unusual method of having a murder scene rendered in icing on his cake, that his father killed his grandfather. The baker, though, has erred, and topped the cake instead with an edible version of Goya’s Saturn Devouring His Son, an image so disturbing it causes the child to question his own existence. “Saturn,” a party guest helpfully informs him, “represents Time, which, with its ravenous appetite for life, devours all its creations.” Later we will learn that the bowling alley never existed, and that some or all of these characters may very well be dead.Welcome, if you have not been here before, to the world of Joy Williams – widely praised, sadly not quite as widely read. My Vintage paperback of 2001’s dazzling The Quick and the Dead carries admiring quotes by Don DeLillo, Raymond Carver and Bret Easton Ellis, yet in the UK it is unforgivably out of print. Williams’s 2015 short story collection The Visiting Privilege was heralded by all who read it as a major literary event, yet it took the tiny imprint Tuskar Rock to bring it to the UK market.On the surface of it, Harrow, her first novel in more than 20 years, seems unlikely to broaden her audience. This is not to say the book is not brilliant – it is. It’s simply that Williams has made no concessions; she remains wonderfully and determinedly herself. What might be a little different, though, is the world into which her work emerges, and the reality she so daringly alchemises into her vision.  Attempting a precis of this novel feels like exactly the kind of misguided endeavour Williams would scorn, but allow me to try. Harrow is set in an undefined near future in which the global environmental situation has gone from being on “the verge that people thought would go on forever” to all-out catastrophe. Khristen, the novel’s not-quite-central character, briefly died as a baby, or so her mother adamantly believes, and may never have entirely returned. Post-disaster, amid a hallucinatory terrain that may or may not be an afterlife, she finds herself at The Institute, where a loose collective of geriatric terrorists “in the worst of health but with kamikaze hearts” plot suicide missions targeting vivisectionists and pesticide salesmen in the hope that this will “refresh, through crackpot violence, a plundered earth”.Williams’s method is one of adjacency more than linearity. Language, not narrative, is the connective tissue. To read her is to be flung every which way: from the spiritually profound to the farcically bizarre. One minute we observe “unprepared souls, moments from the clarity of their deaths”. The next, we are invited to consider the condition of a very old man’s penis: “She wondered if his pecker was as shredded and gribbled and nicked as the rest of him or whether it hung wondrously, impossibly smooth and aloof, its head like burled oak.” Every sentence is lathed into sleek and startling perfection. At the bowling alley, serious bowlers “held the afterward of their poses for a vanity of time”. A crashing car flies “like a crumpled Kleenex into a cement utility pole by which it was trephined with glittering efficiency”. A salesman is so talented he “could sell a shock collar to a Doberman”. Even seemingly offhand phrases glitter with wit. Admire if you will the sing-song perfection of “Eddie Fucking Emerald offed by a fatty in a Caddy”. Zeroing in on our collective complacency and denial, Williams is both wry and merciless, lamenting “twelve lane highways with bicycle supplements” and people “who think they can still save the earth by grinding up some modest nut or bean for pancake meal”. A pre‑collapse environmental conference includes a talk entitled The Potentiality of Landscape’s Emptiness: The Integrity of Half Measures. A TV channel streams nothing but minutes of silence. “We all lead three lives,” Khristen is told. “The true one, the false one, and the one we are not aware of.” This life we’re not aware of is Williams’s great subject. She peels back the visible and known, revealing death and chaos beneath. Wandering around a rescue centre for birds, Khristen stumbles across “an old oil drum, brimming with amputated wings”. A grove of trees is “surprisingly green and freshly pleasant except for the packages of meat dumped there”. What seems to be a livestream of a nesting bird is in fact a recording, the bird having long ago flown into a truck.Part of what makes Williams’s work so destabilising is that agency has almost no significance. Navigating a world that makes no sense, her characters are lost and baffled, their actions and ideas stripped of meaning. These are people who “suspected they were meant to be more or different but fumbled about in the smoky light of half-realised lives”. With free will in question, and the borders between life and death or reality and delusion queasily blurred, individuality itself begins to fray. “Every person,” Williams tells us, “considered themselves unique as snowflakes but in the aggregate they were a blizzard, a whiteout of swirling expectation and denial.”In her remarkable essay Hawk, about a beloved dog that inexplicably attacks her, Williams writes: “Experience is fundamentally illusory. When one is experiencing emotional pain or grief, one feels that everything that happens in life is unreal. And this is a right understanding of life.” Harrow reminds us that, as a consequence of climate collapse, trauma and grief are the condition of our collective existence. As our world disintegrates, it will take what we think of as reality with it. Addressing this in fiction will be the job, partly, of a certain kind of modern mystic. Williams – great virtuoso of the unreal – is one of them.  Harrow by Joy Williams is published by Tuskar Rock (£14.99). Sam Byers’ latest novel is Come Join Our Disease (Faber).
