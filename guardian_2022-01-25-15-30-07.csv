1/25/2022,"Good morning, I’m Virginia Harrison and here are today’s top stories.  Boris Johnson faces renewed anger from MPs and bereaved families after the disclosure his then fiancee threw him a surprise lockdown birthday party in 2020, as sources said an official inquiry had uncovered “appalling evidence of mismanagement” at the heart of Downing Street. In the latest alleged breach of rules, No 10 admitted that Carrie Johnson held a party for the prime minister and up to 30 staff on 19 June 2020 despite Covid rules banning indoor social gatherings. ITV reported that the prime minister attended the party in the cabinet room at No 10 at 2pm on his 56th birthday, and that the interior designer Lulu Lytle – who was not a member of No 10 staff – was there. The room was said to have been laid out with Marks & Spencer party food and a birthday cake, with staff singing “Happy Birthday” and staying for 20-30 minutes. No 10 said Johnson attended for less than 10 minutes and denied reports from ITV that he held a party later on 19 June in his Downing Street residence. While the birthday do is likely to inflame public anger over the behaviour at Downing Street, Sue Gray – the senior civil servant leading the inquiry into the No 10 parties – is understood to have already been told about the allegations. That means the latest exposé is unlikely to delay publication of her report, potentially late this week. Gray is expected to make deeply critical recommendations on overhauling No 10’s operation after hearing of repeated failures of leadership, according to a Whitehall source who spoke to the inquiry. Here’s a full list of the rule-busting “parties” at No 10 likely to be scrutinised. Biden declares ‘unity’ over Ukraine – US president Joe Biden has insisted there was “total” unity among western powers after crisis talks with European leaders on how to deter Russia from an attack against Ukraine, as Downing Street warned of “unprecedented sanctions” against Moscow should an invasion take place. Boris Johnson’s office also said “the leaders agreed on the importance of international unity in the face of growing Russian hostility”. Washington is trying to maintain transatlantic and Nato unity against Russia, which supplies about 40% of the European Union’s natural gas. At the same time, the US has placed 8,500 troops on heightened alert to deploy to Europe as Nato reinforced its eastern borders with warships and fighter jets, amid growing fears of a possible “lightning” attack by Russia to seize the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Kremlin pointed to the new deployments as evidence of aggressive posturing, blaming Nato for the rise in tensions. Dementia study – Dementia patients who see the same GP every time have lower rates of health complications, fewer emergency hospital visits and a better overall quality of life, according to new research. The University of Exeter study – published in the British Journal of General Practice – analysed records for more than 9,000 people aged 65 and over in England living with dementia in 2016. It found those who were consistently seen by the same GP over the course of one year were given fewer medicines and were less likely to be given medicines that can cause problems like falls, incontinence and drowsiness. Dental blitz – Hundreds of thousands of dental patients in England are to be offered weekend and evening appointments under NHS plans to tackle the backlog exacerbated by the pandemic. More than 350,000 extra dental appointments are to be made available in February and March, NHS England said, with a new £50m funding pot aimed at fuelling a dentistry “treatment blitz”. Still, senior dentistry sources said the cash was a “drop in the ocean”, with tens of millions of NHS appointments cancelled as a result of Covid-19 and the resulting backlog set to take years to clear. Islam bias – The middle and upper classes are more likely to hold prejudiced views about Islam than working-class groups, according to a survey from the University of Birmingham. In one of the most detailed surveys conducted on Islamophobia and other forms of racism in modern Britain, data showed 23.2% of people from upper and lower middle-class social groups harbour prejudiced views about Islamic beliefs compared with 18.4% of people questioned from working-class groups. The findings come one day after the prime minister ordered a formal inquiry into allegations by the Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani that she was sacked as a minister after being told her “Muslimness” was “making colleagues uncomfortable”. ‘Your hot take is completely false’ – Taylor Swift has called out Damon Albarn, lead singer of Blur and later of Gorillaz, on Twitter after the British musician told the LA Times she “doesn’t write her own songs”. “I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this,” the American singer, 32, wrote on Twitter to Albarn. “I write ALL of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and SO damaging. You don’t have to like my songs but it’s really fucked up to try and discredit my writing. WOW.” Albarn later apologised, writing to Swift on Twitter: “I totally agree with you. I had a conversation about songwriting and sadly it was reduced to clickbait. I apologise unreservedly and unconditionally. The last thing I would want to do is discredit your songwriting. I hope you understand.” The new year has brought with it significant policy decisions for Boris Johnson: from how to respond to a worsening crisis in Ukraine, to how quickly to lift coronavirus restrictions. Should he move ahead with tax hikes in the face of an acute cost-of-living crisis? But all these questions have been drowned out by a more existential one for the prime minister: can his premiership survive the coming days?

1/25/2022,"A senior commonwealth official who was sacked by Barnaby Joyce in 2015 has been promoted to become the second most powerful bureaucrat in New South Wales. Paul Grimes is the new state treasury secretary, continuing the revival of his public service career that included stints as a deputy secretary under then federal treasurer Peter Costello and as a senior adviser to Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd during the global financial crisis.  Grimes, however, later had a public falling out in 2015 when Joyce was agriculture minister. Joyce sacked Grimes, his agriculture secretary, saying at the time that there was “no realistic prospect” he could have a “relationship of strong mutual confidence”. Joyce had insisted a correction to the Hansard parliamentary record of an incorrect answer he gave regarding drought support loans had been made by his staff, without his knowledge, and that he had asked for the changes to be reversed when he became aware they had been made. Grimes, though, implied there was a different version of events, even requesting an extraordinary Senate committee hearing. After his exit from Canberra, Grimes took up senior positions, including with the Victorian government. Almost two years ago, he was handpicked by Matt Kean, then NSW energy and environment minister, to coordinate his department. Now the NSW treasurer, Kean announced on Tuesday that Grimes would be the new treasury secretary – starting on Saturday – and praised his attributes as an older style official unafraid to give frank advice. “What a man of integrity he is,” Kean told Guardian Australia. “What a coup this is for NSW.” Grimes, an economist, will succeed two bankers in the top Treasury role, his appointment coming just as the government puts the final touches on a support package to aid the state’s economic recovery from Omicron. NSW accounts for about one-third of the national economy and a recent CBA State of the States report has its performance lagging all but the ACT’s. Kean said Grimes had worked to develop the state’s energy roadmap aimed at attracting billions of dollars of investment. The plan aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy and provide lower-cost electricity to households and businesses alike. The new treasury secretary will oversee the next state budget, due by mid-year, which will be the last before elections in March 2023, Kean said. So far, there is little sign of additional economic support from the commonwealth. Grimes’s appointment follows an earlier-than-expected exit by current treasury secretary Mike Pratt, who had indicated he planned to leave by March. Pratt’s tenure had lately been clouded by a dispute between Treasury and the audit office, with the auditor general, Margaret Crawford, initially refusing to sign off on the state’s accounts over the controversial assessment of rail assets. That dispute ended earlier this month although the cost in terms of future accounting changes may tally as much as $4.1bn. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, who was treasurer when the rail assets saga began, praised Pratt for his almost decade-long service, including four and a half years as treasury secretary. Pratt played “a vital and leading role in guiding the economy through the greatest economic challenge that NSW has faced since the Great Depression – the Covid-19 pandemic – saving tens of thousands of jobs and businesses,” the premier said. “Mr Pratt’s sound fiscal management and expert advice allowed the NSW government to help people when they needed it most during drought, bushfires, floods and the pandemic, as well ensuring the state will continue to deliver for future generations.” Barnaby Joyce, now deputy prime minister, was approached for comment.",News/Australia news,‘Man of integrity’: NSW elevates official who had public falling out with Barnaby Joyce,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/man-of-integrity-nsw-elevates-official-who-had-public-falling-out-with-barnaby-joyce
1/25/2022,"Critically acclaimed smaller West End shows are being squeezed out of theatre’s post-Omicron recovery as major players use discounted tickets to attract returning audiences. The award-winning theatre producer David Pugh told the Guardian that he feared it could spell the end of plays in the West End. His latest show, the highly rated Pride and Prejudice* (*Sort of), will close next month despite original hopes that it would have an open-ended run.  Pugh said his 112 investors had all lost their money, with the production facing expected losses in the region of £750,000 – as much as £25,000 a week. The losses meant a decision was made to end the run in February, he said. “It’s why I’m not sleeping at night,” he said, adding that the rug had suddenly been pulled from underneath what he described as a carefully calibrated economic plan designed to ensure the play was accessible to as many people as possible. By contrast with his show, where tickets have a top price of £59, major West End shows have cut prices to as little as £10 amid competition for members of the public cautiously returning to theatre, and the continuing absence of tourists. Written by Isobel McArthur, who also co-directs and performs in the musical take on the Jane Austen novel, Pride and Prejudice (Sort of) has been playing at London’s Criterion theatre since last year after an initial production in Scotland and a tour. The Guardian’s chief theatre critic, Arifa Akbar, wrote in a review in November: “However inconceivable a production it sounds, with its karaoke numbers and its silliness, it creates something new and joyous from the old.” Pugh, who has won two Tony awards in the US and four Olivier awards in the UK, said it had been a priority to keep ticket prices low when he brought the production to the West End as he believed that theatregoing was too often elitist, with costs prohibitive for many people. “We also didn’t know who had money any more as a result of the pandemic and where the audience would come from, so we deliberately avoided booking fees and went for a simple price structure people could see, which was a top price of £59.50 that went down to £9.50. By contrast, other shows set their prices at what I think were ridiculous highs,” he said. Pugh said he and others behind similar-sized productions simply “couldn’t win” against larger ones that had bigger marketing campaigns, larger capacities and, in some cases, wealthy backers that included hedge funds. Productions of all sizes are only now emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, which caused high absence rates among casts and backstage staff. Many theatres have said they will continue to ask audiences to wear masks. Even after almost two years of uncertainty, theatres across the UK are still in the most precarious of positions. The producer Kenny Wax, whose hits include the musical Six and the Goes Wrong series of comedies, told the Guardian last month that there was much greater audience confidence on Broadway where “everyone wears masks in the theatres”. Sir Nicholas Hytner, the artistic director of the Bridge theatre in London, said it was time to examine support such as short-term finance, loans and reviews of VAT and business rates. This week Pugh said he was highly concerned about the commercial viability of plays in London’s West End in the future. While he had been grateful to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport for providing basic funding at the height of the pandemic that had enabled him and others to cover administrative costs, the threat facing his end of the sector was now acute, he said. “I am not sure that our current culture minister is really aware of how theatre helps other businesses’ going. I’m thinking of all the restaurants, cafes, taxis and shops in the West End who need the footfall from theatregoers,” said Pugh. “It would be nice if it was recognised that commercial theatre is integral to the West End. I think our culture minister thinks we rely on our investors, but they can only take so many losses. There’s a fear they may think twice before investing in the theatre in future.” Pride and Prejudice* (*Sort of) Critically acclaimed anarchic reboot of the Austen novel.

1/25/2022,"The middle and upper classes are more likely to hold prejudiced views about Islam than working-class groups, according to a survey from the University of Birmingham. In one of the most detailed surveys conducted on Islamophobia and other forms of racism in modern Britain, data showed 23.2% of people from upper and lower middle-class social groups harbour prejudiced views about Islamic beliefs compared with 18.4% of people questioned from working-class groups.  The survey, carried out in conjunction with YouGov, found the British public is almost three times more likely to hold prejudiced views of Islam than they are of other religions, with 21.1% of British people wrongly believing Islam teaches its followers that the Qur’an must be read “totally literally”. “It’s the people from an upper and middle class background, who presumably are university educated, who feel more confident in their judgments but [are] also more likely to make an incorrect judgment,” said Dr Stephen Jones, the report’s lead author. “It’s almost like because they’re more educated, they’re also more miseducated, because that’s the way Islam is presented in our society.” The findings, presented in a report entitled The Dinner Table Prejudice: Islamophobia in Contemporary Britain, were based on interviews with a sample of 1,667 people between 20 and 21 July 2021. The survey found more than one in four people, and nearly half of Conservative and Leave voters, hold conspiratorial views about Sharia “no-go areas”, while Muslims are the UK’s second “least liked” group, after Gypsy and Irish Travellers, with 25.9% of the British public feeling negatively towards Muslims. The survey also found 18.1% of people support prohibiting all Muslim migration to the UK, a rate 4-6% higher than the same view for other ethnic and religious groups. The report suggested a lack of public censure for Islamophobia, citing the example of Conservative MP Nadine Dorries supportively tweeting remarks made by anti-Islam activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (also known as Tommy Robinson), was one reason why prejudice was so widespread. “There’s a lack of criticism that follows Islamophobia, and that seems to correspond to the way in which Islamophobia is dealt with in public life,” said Jones. “The survey shows quite clearly it’s a very widespread prejudice. But it’s just not given the same kind of seriousness as other forms of prejudice. “People who work in public office, whether MPs or councillors, who have got away with saying things about Muslims that they simply would not get away with if they were talking about other kinds of minority. That’s not to say those other issues don’t need to be taken seriously as well, it’s simply to say that this particular form of prejudice doesn’t get due recognition.” Researchers recommended the government and other public figures should publicly acknowledge the lack of criticism of Islamophobia, and how it stands out compared with other forms of racism and prejudice. The report also suggested civil society organisations and equality bodies should recognise how systemic miseducation about Islam is common in British society and is a key element of Islamophobia. Jones said: “No one is calling for laws regulating criticism of religion, but we have to recognise that the British public has been systematically miseducated about Islamic tradition and take steps to remedy this.”",News/World news,"Middle-class Britons more likely to be biased about Islam, finds survey",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/middle-class-britons-more-likely-to-be-biased-about-islam-finds-survey
1/25/2022,"Hospital bosses fear that pregnant women could be denied a home birth or water birth in the event of an exodus of midwives triggered by compulsory Covid vaccination for NHS staff. There are concerns that mothers-to-be could also be unable to have their baby at their local hospital as already understaffed maternity units in England struggle to cope with the loss of up to 2,000 midwives.  Others may have their child delivered with the help of a doctor rather than a midwife, or be assisted during their birth by a midwife who is simultaneously looking after another labouring woman, they said. Hospital chiefs have described preparing to scale back the care they offer to expectant mothers from 1 April, the deadline for frontline staff to be double-vaccinated or lose their jobs. Hospitals in England are already 2,500 midwives short of the number they need to give every pregnant woman the right standard of care, the Commons health committee has estimated. Midwives and nurses are the two groups of frontline staff most likely to resist getting jabbed, NHS chiefs said. Last week the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, a former chief nursing officer, told a House of Lords debate that as many as 12.5% of all midwives in London may lose their jobs because of their determination not to get vaccinated. There has been speculation that the government is to delay introducing the policy, though it has insisted the date will not change. The medical royal colleges representing midwives, nurses and GPs have urged ministers to delay. NHS insiders told the Guardian privately of their concern that women may not be able to exercise their rights under the NHS constitution to decide whether to give birth at home, in a midwife-led unit or in a hospital labour ward. Maternity guidelines say women should have the support of one midwife with them throughout their labour. “The truth is that we won’t cope [if many midwives leave rather than get vaccinated]. It’ll be much harder to have a home birth and women may have to resort to [hiring] doulas,” said an executive at one hospital where many midwives remain unvaccinated 10 days before the 3 February cutoff set by NHS England for receiving a first dose. Trainee midwives will also have to play a bigger role to help compensate for the loss of experienced, fully trained colleagues, the executive added. The chief executive of another NHS trust said: “[The loss of midwives means] neighbouring units would have to do mutual aid when busy, so yes, more women will be asked to change their hospital of choice at the last minute. “Hospitals will also have less capacity to do antenatal and postnatal appointments and midwife birthing units will be compromised because you would pull staff on to labour wards.” Barking, Havering and Redbridge trust in London recently said its existing lack of midwives combined with a likely loss linked to mandatory jabs will pose a major challenge. Matthew Trainer, its chief executive, told a board meeting that the birth centre at its Queen’s hospital in Romford, Essex, which is already closed because of the midwife shortage, would have to remain shut “if we lost another chunk of midwives” as a result of the new requirement. Another senior NHS figure said: “From conversations I’ve had, I think that more than half of all maternity units will have difficulty maintaining their normal maternity services.” Chris Hopson, the chief executive of hospital body NHS Providers, last month cited the case of an unnamed maternity unit that is facing the potential loss of as many as 40 midwives. The Department of Health and Social Care defended the policy and gave no hint of a delay. A spokesperson said: “Health and social care workers look after the most vulnerable people in society, who could face serious health consequences if exposed to the virus. “Ensuring staff are vaccinated is the right thing to do to protect patients and those in care. The vast majority of NHS staff have had the vaccine which is our best defence against Covid-19.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Home births in England may be denied if midwives without Covid jab lose jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/25/home-births-in-england-may-be-denied-if-midwives-without-covid-jab-lose-jobs
1/25/2022,"Arogue prime minister on the verge of defenestration drives out news of almost anything else. But housing usually languishes in the forgotten in-tray anyway. It sits low in voters’ and government concerns: the last 17 housing ministers remained in post, on average, for barely more than a year. Housing stories fill news pages, but only if they provide an opportunity to gloat over escalating property prices. So it shouldn’t be a surprise that a shocking report on a Conservative flagship housing policy fell below the news radar. The Lords-built environment committee has revealed that all of the £29bn spent on the help-to-buy scheme has been wasted. The scheme gives subsidies for homeownership, but all they do is “inflate prices by more than their subsidy value”. They “do not provide good value for money”, which would be “better spent on increasing housing supply.”  The report, chaired by the Tory ex-minister and businesswoman Lucy Neville-Rolfe, shows that Margaret Thatcher’s signature right-to-buy policy lies at the heart of the ballooning housing crisis. The council house sales under this policy symbolised a rolling back of the state to create a property-owning, share-holding, Tory-voting electorate. (Pollsters use homeownership as a strong indicator for voting Conservative.) Councils that were forced to sell at knockdown prices were also barred from using the receipts to replenish the council housing stock. This meant a bargain for the 2 million tenants who bought council homes, but a disaster for the low-earners who came after. In 1980, a third of people lived in socially rented homes, at genuinely affordable below-market rents. That’s now fallen to 17%. Over the past 30 years, England has seen a net loss of 24,000 social homes every year on average. Another 29,000 social homes vanished alone through sales and demolitions. Those disappeared tenants end up in the expanding private-rented sector. Instead of paying for lasting brick-and-mortar council homes, the taxpayer subsidises private landlords through housing benefit, costing £22bn a year. The Lords report quotes the housing analyst Toby Lloyd: “The private rented sector is by far the most expensive, by far the lowest quality and by far the least popular. It is absolutely the worst possible tenure for almost everybody in it.” Of the many destructive Tory social policies, help to buy, announced in 2013, was always an especially egregious example of naked vote-getting. Its creator, George Osborne, knew a subsidy to buy homes worth as much as £600,000 would just inflate prices – and it did. It slightly speeded up the purchase date for those who were already likely to buy, often via family help. More people on high incomes – over £80,000 – use the scheme than low earners. Yet ownership is still falling and the age of first-time buyers keeps rising. Bringing up a family in a private-rented home means living under the shadow of eviction, with private landlords using section 21 orders to evict tenants for no reason. I once followed the misfortunes of one family that was forced to move, time and again, sometimes having to move their children’s schools too, often living in squalor, once through a long winter with a broken boiler. They weren’t destitute, both parents were in work, but their children were deprived of a permanent home in their early years. Last month’s excoriating report by the National Audit Office (NAO) on private renting found that in 29,000 instances in one year, “households were, or were at risk of being made homeless following an eviction that was not their fault”. I heard a few of those voices of distress last week when I listened in to the helpline at the housing charity Shelter, hearing the struggles of those who should be in social housing. Among the many homeless, Jay (not her real name) was typical of those NAO findings. Frail and on personal independence payment, she was suddenly facing eviction. Why? She complained to her landlord about frequent sewage flooding; getting no response she called environmental health. Her landlord, taking revenge, is evicting her, needing no reason. The NAO says a quarter of private rentals are of “non-decent” standard, and 13% have at least one serious hazard. The government long ago promised a bill to protect tenants, abolishing section 21 evictions, but there’s no sign of it. What hope is there of “levelling up”? Access to quality, affordable housing is going into reverse, according to a report from Legal & General this week. Property is where the nation’s wealth is stored, and there it stays – useless and unproductive. Who dares break the taboo on the sacred right of homeowners not to be taxed on their ballooning unearned property wealth? A hypothecated tax spent directly on council housing would link the winners to the growing numbers of those who lose out in Britain’s grossly dysfunctional housing market.

Temperatures into next week are forecast to rise into the low 40Cs once again through northern parts of Argentina, Uruguay and much of Paraguay.

1/25/2022,"With Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth streaming and in cinemas, I am struck by the way this particular Shakespeare tragedy acts as a magnet for movie-makers. It has obvious attractions: it is short, atmospheric, confronts the nature of evil and is open to adaptation. Parallel versions range from Akira Kurosawa’s magnificent samurai epic Throne of Blood to a low-budget film noir from the 1950s, Joe Macbeth. But, after viewing four versions that stick closer to the original text, I am intrigued to see what they tell us about the filming of Shakespeare. Although it got rave reviews and has some original touches – such as opening with the silent burial of the Macbeths’ child – I was least impressed by Justin Kurzel’s 2015 film. There is no denying Kurzel’s visual sense: we get epic battles and seductive shots of mist-wreathed Scottish landscapes. But, put bluntly, the film seems terrified of Shakespeare’s language: Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard as the Macbeths speak in hushed, conversational tones and insert pauses between each line that would make Pinter blush. “If we should fail?” asks Macbeth of the projected murder of Duncan. Five seconds later Lady M finally gets round to replying: “We fail.”  That same verbal hiatus appears in Roman Polanski’s 1971 film where Jon Finch and Francesca Annis again handle the language with kid gloves. There are several things to like about this movie: the mocking laughter with which Macbeth and Banquo greet the Witches’ predictions, the elevation of Ross into a slippery traitor, the final hint that the killing of kings is a cyclical process. But, with its real castles, its shots of horses galloping across beaches and its sense that the Macbeths are handsome ciphers, it feels more like a costume epic than an imaginative exploration of Shakespeare’s play. With Coen’s stunning new Macbeth, we are into a different world. Bruno Delbonnel’s black-and-white cinematography and Stefan Dechant’s design eschew realism: the Macbeths inhabit a brutalist castle whose long perspectives suggest a de Chirico painting. Visual and aural motifs, deriving from the text, include flights of ravens, echoing footsteps, the coalescence of dripping blood and water. Cinema is also used to supply information missing from the play: we see Brendan Gleeson’s sleeping Duncan wakened by the terrifying sight of his knife-wielding host. Above all, the film charts in detail the collapsing relationship between Denzel Washington’s Macbeth and Frances McDormand’s Lady Macbeth. A friend suggested their severance stems from the moment when Macbeth returns from the murder clutching the daggers. For me, the real revelation was McDormand’s look of total dismay when she passes Banquo’s hired killers on the stairs. Much as I admire the Coen film, my favourite movie Macbeth remains Orson Welles’s 1948 version. Filmed in 23 days on a budget of less than $200,000, it attracted much derision at the time for its papier-mache sets and palpable cheapness. Yet it stands up beautifully today for its visual bravura and clear vision of Shakespeare’s play. Welles had already staged what in 1937 was known as the voodoo Macbeth where the witches became practitioners of the dark arts. In the film he pits a palpably Christian world against one of pagan witchcraft. Welles creates the character of a Holy Father who leads Duncan’s troops in prayer (“Dost thou renounce Satan and all his works?”) and fills the screen with Celtic crosses and iconic religious images. But Welles also makes brilliant use of the cavernous quality of his studio set to suggest the labyrinthine nature of Macbeth’s mind. It is an astonishing film which clearly left its mark on the Coen movie. What they both prove is in that in filming Macbeth – or possibly any Shakespeare play – the last thing you need is a doggedly realistic approach.

1/25/2022,"The global fight against corruption has been at a standstill for a decade, with 86% of countries either worsening or making no progress in tackling the problem, and with numerous governments accused of using the pandemic to erode human rights and democracy, a report has found. Transparency International’s annual corruption ranking, published on Tuesday, also found countries that violate civil liberties consistently have low scores, underlining how failure to tackle corruption exacerbates human rights abuses and undermines democracy.  First launched in 1995, the corruption perceptions index (CPI) has become one of the leading global trackers of public sector corruption, drawing data from 13 public sources, including the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. At least three sources are required to provide a ranking for each of the 180 countries included. The index gives a mark out of 100 – with 100 representing “very clean” and zero representing “highly corrupt”. Countries are ranked relative to each other. The 2021 index highlights the connection between corruption, democracy and human rights – from the lowest-scoring countries to advanced economies. It notes that out of 331 recorded cases of murdered human rights defenders in 2020, 98% occurred in countries with a CPI score below 45. The report cites recent cases in the Philippines and Venezuela. “The Philippines has continued its fall beginning in 2014 to a score of 33, as President Rodrigo Duterte has cracked down on freedoms of association and expression since his election in 2016,” said Transparency International. “It also has an exceptionally high murder rate of human rights defenders, with 20 killed in 2020.” In Venezuela, the report says: “The government of President Nicolás Maduro has repressed dissent of political opponents, journalists and even healthcare workers. The country has significantly declined on the CPI over the last decade, earning its lowest score yet of 14 in 2021.” The index also examines regional drivers of corruption. In eastern Europe and central Asia, the report describes a “vicious cycle of increasing authoritarianism, human rights abuses and corruption [where] political leaders used the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to reduce oversight and accountability for public procurement and foreign aid spending, from Albania to Kyrgyzstan”. Altynai Myrzabekova, Transparency International’s central Asia regional adviser, said: “2021 has been devastating for civil rights across eastern Europe and central Asia. Corrupt leaders repress all dissent – from opposition parties, to activists and the press. “While doing little to combat the Covid-19 pandemic’s impact on the population, governments have utilised it to further curb rights and freedoms, further entrenching authoritarianism.” While the index noted some improvements in sub-Saharan Africa, it described them as being “overshadowed by backsliding and stagnation in others … [with] serious corruption problems … exacerbated by ongoing violent conflicts and terrorist attacks in countries from South Sudan to Mali”. Samuel Kaninda, the group’s Africa adviser, said: “A decade of stagnating corruption levels has been devastating for sub-Saharan Africa. Natural resources are plundered and millions of people lack access to public services, while violent conflicts rage on and terrorist threats rise. Meanwhile, grand corruption allows elites to act with impunity, siphoning money away from the continent and leaving the public with little in the way of rights or resources.” Similarly, in the Middle East and north Africa, Transparency International found “systemic political corruption obstructs progress and exacerbates human rights abuses. “In light of rampant political corruption across the Arab states, the region is struggling to achieve any tangible results in the fight for transparency, human rights and democracy. Not a single country has significantly improved since 2012. Political elites and private interests time and again overtake the common good to benefit themselves and maintain autocracy.” Denmark, Finland and New Zealand topped the index with scores of 88 out of 100, while in its lowest reaches Somalia and Syria each scored 13, and South Sudan 11. The index also reported 27 countries – among them Cyprus (scoring 53), Canada (74), Lebanon (24) and Honduras (23) – reaching historic lows last year. Delia Ferreira Rubio, chair of Transparency International, said: “Human rights are not simply a nice-to-have in the fight against corruption. Authoritarian approaches destroy independent checks and balances and make anti-corruption efforts dependent on the whims of an elite. Ensuring people can speak freely and work collectively to hold power to account is the only sustainable route to a corruption-free society.”",News/Global development,Governments around the world used Covid to erode human rights – report,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/25/governments-around-the-world-used-covid-to-erode-human-rights-report
1/25/2022,"Laura Mount became a doctor – she visibly winces at repeating such a cliche – to help people. Also, she was good at school. Her dad was a chemist, which is where she got her love of science; her mum, who was a hairdresser, gave Mount her drive. “If you didn’t do well and get on with it, you knew,” says Mount. “She felt she missed out on all that. So she was quite strict. She wanted us to do well.” Mount, 44, has been a GP for 15 years. She is a partner at the Folly Lane medical centre in Warrington, Cheshire, which is also where she grew up and has lived her entire life, apart from her training in Sheffield. In addition to being a GP, Mount is the clinical director of a primary care network, coordinating six GP surgeries across Warrington. On top of this, she runs a vaccine clinic from a community centre in Orford. “It’s all a bit mad,” she says.  Mount has always enjoyed her job, but lately she has felt dissatisfaction creeping in around the edges. It’s partly the patients. “We call them the Amazon Prime generation,” says Mount. “They’re used to ordering something and it comes the next afternoon.” Three or four years ago, Folly Lane would get a patient complaint every three to six months. “We’d get really upset about it,” Mount says, “and spend ages replying to it.” Now, it’s not uncommon to get a complaint every day. When patients don’t get what they want, they harangue reception staff. The surgery records incoming and outgoing phone calls, and Mount gets emotional when she listens back to them. If a patient is particularly abusive, Mount will send out a zero-tolerance letter, warning them that if it happens again, they will have to find a new GP practice. Today, in her treatment room at the beginning of October, Mount writes one such letter. The patient was abusive because they didn’t get their prescription as fast as they would have liked, even though they got it the same day. In her letter, Mount suggests the patient comes in and listens back to the audio of their phone call. The patient won’t take her up on this offer. They never do. The other thing grinding Mount down is the recent spate of hostile headlines in the press. In May, the Daily Mail launched a campaign to make GPs see all patients face-to-face. The newspaper has condemned GPs for being “overpaid” and “moaning”, suggested part-timers choose not to treat patients on Fridays so that they can “enjoy long weekends off” (a claim debunked by the factchecking organisation Full Fact), accused them of being uncaring, and castigated GPs who choose to work part-time. Similar pieces have appeared in the Times, Daily Express, the Sun and the Telegraph. In September, the Doctors’ Association UK complained to the media regulator IPSO about the Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson’s inflammatory anti-GP rhetoric. (In one column, Pearson urged the public to “turn the heat up” on GPs.) To Mount and many of her GP colleagues, opening the newspaper every day feels like sticking their hand in a box of sharps. She is in a WhatsApp group for fellow GPs, which lights up as another invective-laden article is published. “I can cope with long hours and being busy,” says Mount. “I don’t mind working hard. I do it for the patients. But when you are actively being slagged off in the media and being made out to be the villain, that is the lowest point of my career. I feel really demoralised.” What makes the whole thing so infuriating is that GPs were following orders when they switched to remote models of triage. NHS England advised them to do so in March 2020, to mitigate the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, and did not revoke this guidance until May 2021. And yet in September, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, backed the Mail. “I am grateful to the Daily Mail for launching this campaign,” he said, adding that it was “high time” GPs went back to their pre-pandemic operation models. This perception that GPs are refusing to see people face-to-face has contributed to increased patient hostility. A September survey of 1,000 GPs from the healthcare publication Pulse found that 74% had experienced increased levels of abuse post-pandemic. Sometimes, patients complain about the lack of face-to-face appointments while sitting in Mount’s office. “I say: ‘What are we doing right now?” she says. In the period October 2020 to October 2021, 48% of Folly Lane’s patients were face-to-face; in pre-pandemic times, this figure was 60%. While it is true that face-to-face primary care appointments are not back to pre-pandemic levels – in October 2021, 64% of English primary care appointments were face-to-face, compared with 80% in January 2020 – GPs are demonstrably working harder than ever. The number of appointments provided by English primary care increased from 27.2m in January 2020 to 30.2m in October 2021. This is despite the fact that England has lost 1,307 GPs since 2015, nearly 5% of the former total. “Twenty years ago,” says Prof Azeem Majeed, a GP and primary care expert at Imperial College London, “being a GP was very attractive.” In 2005, Majeed would expect 50 applicants for a GP position at his surgery; now, he’s thrilled if they get one decent candidate. There are two vacant GP positions currently open at his practice. “All this press about how we aren’t seeing patients,” says Mount. “Well, maybe you can’t see us because there aren’t that many of us, because it’s such an undesirable profession. Don’t beat up the ones who are still around.” Many of Mount’s friends and colleagues have left. Those who remain have to pick up the slack, in an era of ever-increasing patient numbers. Across England, the average number of patients per GP practice is up 22%. By October, Folly Lane had treated 7,000 more patients than it did in 2019, and there were still two months of the year to go, and winter months at that. “We can’t say we’re full,” says Mount. “It’s uncontrollable. More people will keep coming, and you don’t want to leave them without being seen.” This is Mount’s account of a winter of exceptional demand. 14 October NHS England writes to GPs, announcing a £250m package for primary care – but only if GPs increase the number of patients they see face-to-face. It also informs them that it will be publishing data on face-to-face appointments, and naming and shaming underperforming surgeries. “It’s like another kick,” Mount says. “You aren’t doing a good enough job, and we’re going to punish you for it.” Almost immediately, patients start citing the NHS England letter in their complaints. Morale among GPs is at an all-time low – their WhatsApp groups are aflame. “It’s a job I love,” says Mount. “But some days I also hate it.” 21 October The British Medical Association (BMA) England GP committee rejects the government’s funding package, – specifically the decision to name and shame GPs. It ballots its members on industrial action. English GPs have only gone on strike once since 1975, in a 2012 dispute over pensions. During this strike, GPs continued to treat urgent cases. “The ballot was a cry for help,” says the BMA England GP committee chair, Dr Farah Jameel. “Saying: ‘We can’t carry on like this any more.’” (While the ballot suggested a range of potential options, a strike of GPs was not on the table.) But the issues predate Covid: for years, primary care has been underfunded. In 2005, general practice received 9.6% of the NHS budget. In 2019-20 this figure was about 8.7%. The BMA has called for a minimum of 11% of the NHS budget to go to GPs. In a way, GPs have been enacting a private form of industrial action for years now. “The workforce is leaving,” says Jameel. “We can’t retain clinicians. We can’t even retain reception teams. Do we need to organise for it to be a strike?” Early November Newly installed security cameras blink in the reception at Folly Lane. The partners are spooked: in September, four members of staff were injured in an attack at a surgery in Manchester. Two people had to be taken to hospital with head injuries. “I have members of my reception team who left because they couldn’t cope,” says Jameel. “They were constantly crying at how they were being spoken to by the patients.” She has found it impossible to replace them, despite advertising the role five times. GPs, she says, are inured to the abuse. “Like boiling frogs,” she says. “We’ve learned to live with it.” Were politicians to have realistic conversations with the public about the pressures GPs are under, things might be different. “This frustration,” says Jameel, “is because the public is being led to believe that everything is fine, and GPs are lazy, and that’s why you can’t see them. That’s how the public is being stoked. And of course, if that’s what you believe, you would be angry, too. But if they understood the challenges, they might direct that anger at policymakers.” In Mount’s office, her patients are distressed, with good reason. The pandemic has created a huge backlog in non-Covid care. Between April 2020 and November 2021, there were 4.2m fewer elective procedures, and 29.1m fewer outpatient attendances. In October 2021, 312,665 patients had been waiting more than a year for treatment; in October 2019, this figure was 1,321. Mount sees a patient in his late 60s who has been waiting months for a urology consultation for a prostate operation. Technically, he’s a low-risk patient, but his condition is seriously affecting his quality of life. He can’t leave the house for more than an hour or two, because he constantly needs the toilet. There’s nothing Mount can do; she has tried medicating the issue but it doesn’t work. He needs surgery. A woman in her late 40s comes in with a gynaecological issue. The woman has been waiting for surgery for five months. They agree that Mount should refer her to a different hospital where the waiting list is shorter, even though she’ll have to go to the back of the queue. “She’s in pain,” says Mount, “and can’t leave the house for a week or two every month.” As the afternoon wears on, it seems that almost every patient is presenting with a waiting-list-related issue. They need a hip replacement, or a knee replacement, and they’re in pain. This has never happened to Mount before. “As a doctor, you want to help people,” says Mount. “It’s not nice when you watch your patients suffer, and you have to explain to them why they have to continue suffering.” 12 November Last night, on BBC One’s Question Time, Alastair Campbell excoriated the government for its treatment of GPs. “I’m getting really worried about these attacks on GPs,” Campbell said. “Which I think are being orchestrated.” A colleague shares the clip via WhatsApp. Mount watches it while eating breakfast. “It was nice to hear that someone was speaking up for us,” she says. “Because everyone thinks we’re shut.” Mid-November Mount spends a day at the vaccine centre. Currently, they are rolling out booster vaccines to over-40s and the clinically vulnerable, although there has been chatter that the rollout will be widened to all adults soon. Mount is dealing with a routine query when there’s a commotion. Staff peer out of the window. There’s an anti-vaxxer outside. “Only the vaccinated die young!” he chants. Bizarrely, he’s carrying a golf club. Mount is unfazed. He has been coming since spring. Because of him, the practice had to install opaque screens across the windows, so that he wouldn’t be able to view confidential patient information. After a few hours, the man gets bored and goes off to play golf. The worst anti-vaxxers are the ones who disrupt the clinics. In May, Mount was running a vaccine bus outside the town hall when two anti-vaxxers went to the car park, told everyone the clinic had run out of vaccine, and sent them home. Late November Mount sees a patient with Covid symptoms. Folly Lane has a designated treatment room for patients with suspected Covid, but the patient is insisting she be seen in a regular treatment room. The woman, who is in her mid-30s, keeps telling Mount that she believes that she has a bacterial chest infection, and is asking for antibiotics. Mount tells her that she needs to rule out Covid first, and sends her for a PCR test. “People get angry when you ask them to go for a PCR test,” says Mount. “Like you’ve accused them of doing something wrong. They feel like they know it’s not Covid.” This is a daily occurrence at Folly Lane. “When I say they have to go to a special room, they get upset,” says Mount. “They don’t want to go in that room. That’s the room where patients with Covid have been.” Sometimes patients lie and say they have had a negative PCR, not realising that the results come through to Mount’s computer. That evening, Mount has a bath when she gets in, and washes her hands. The patient was coughing all over her. The test comes back the following day: the patient has Covid. “It makes me angry that my staff have to expose themselves to the risk because patients refuse to get a test,” says Mount. “They’re expecting us to expose ourselves to the illness. And we can’t say no. We have to see them.” Despite the fact that Mount’s team regularly see Covid-positive patients, they are not given high-quality FFP3 masks. At the beginning of the pandemic, the surgery couldn’t even get surgical masks from central supply. When they eventually arrived, they had a sticker stuck over the best-before date. 26 November The Omicron variant has been detected in South Africa. Mount has been given orders to ramp up the booster rollout. Her new target, set by NHS England, is to give out boosters to 90% of those eligible by 19 December. So far, she’s at 68%. Mount would like to give out more vaccines, but just doesn’t have the stock. “We are begging for more vaccines,” she says. “We are going as fast as the supply allows.” Another patient complaint. A nurse used a tongue depressor to examine his throat, and it made him gag. Mount dashes out the response. “I am very sorry for any distress you have felt,” she writes, explaining that use of a tongue depressor is a routine part of a physical examination. Early December An exhausting day at the surgery. “You have to be fully functioning,” says Mount. “It’s like a conveyor belt. Patient after patient after patient.” Because minor conditions are screened out during telephone triage and assigned to junior doctors or nurses, every person Mount sees has a complex condition. Appointments are scheduled into 10-minute slots, which gives them a Generation Game-like feel, but with life-and-death stakes. On an average day, Mount treats 40 patients. According to BMA guidance, any more than 25 patient-doctor contacts a day is unsafe. “We are already at the point where patient safety is being compromised,” says Jameel. “It has been for a long time.” She has colleagues who see or speak to 120 patients a day. Every one of these contacts is fraught with risk. Every one of them is potentially life-threatening. Mount sees a pregnant woman in her early 30s with abdominal pain. Mount suspects an ectopic pregnancy, which can be fatal if untreated. The gynaecological registrar at the hospital won’t accept the patient without blood tests to rule out appendicitis. But these tests can take 24 hours to come back. Mount pleads with the registrar, who relents. Mount checks the patient’s notes the next day: it was an ectopic pregnancy. 12 December In light of the fact that Omicron cases are rocketing, the BMA has offered the government an opportunity to “reset” its relationship with GPs. Mount is at home with her family. It’s her son’s 14th birthday. As she cooks his favourite meal – roast chicken and chocolate cake – news breaks that Boris Johnson has scheduled a press conference that evening. Her WhatsApp lights up. “All the GPs are going crazy,” she says. “Saying that the press always finds out about everything before us.” She feels a spike of anxiety: throughout the pandemic, she has found out about changes to the vaccination programme via the news, and there’s no reason to expect this evening will be any different. Come 8pm, Mount watches the press conference. Johnson announces that all English adults will have the chance to get a booster by the end of the month, provided they had their second dose of the vaccine at least three months previously. People can walk in for vaccines, without appointments. Getting everyone boosted before the new year is to be the NHS’s No 1 priority. When the press conference is over, Mount opens her laptop. She crunches the numbers: her primary care network needs to deliver 10,000 boosters before January. For context, they have delivered 9,000 boosters since September. They are effectively being told to do three months’ work in three weeks, during the busiest time of year for GPs, when patients present with seasonal flu and staff are off for the holidays. First, Mount applies for permission for all of the surgeries in her primary care network to become vaccination sites. Then, she emails the team at her vaccination centre, to see what extra dates they can put on. Afterwards, she warns her husband that she won’t be able to see him and the kids much before Christmas. She tells her daughter she won’t be able to take her to the Christmas market in Manchester any more. She cancels all of her days off, leaving only Christmas Eve, for present wrapping. She sleeps badly and arrives at Folly Lane early the next morning. By the end of the day she has seen 28 patients, reviewed a batch of prescriptions, filled out her paperwork, supervised a trainee GP and a pharmacist, written a plan to increase vaccine capacity to 1,120 doses a day, and obtained all the permits. “If things feel out of control,” Mount says, “I need to get back in control again, as quickly as possible.” 14 December The Orford vaccine centre is vaccinating 1,000 people a day. The queue stretches around the building. “A few weeks ago,” says Mount, “ministers were saying not particularly nice things about general practice. We’re doing this for the patients, not for the government. That’s how the NHS runs. It’s on the goodwill of people. Primary care will always deliver.” Mount puts an out-of-office on her email, informing people that she will only answer urgent queries and emails about the booster rollout. Folly Lane has postponed a few non-urgent disease review clinics. “In three months,” says Mount, “are GPs going to be criticised for what we did have to postpone? Will the government accuse us of earning money from it?” Her nerves are frayed. She’s exhausted, and living on coffee. 15 December The centre is vaccinating 1,400 people a day. Mount gets a strange email. The person asks for their vaccination data, and then tells them to watch the prime minister’s press conference, later that evening. Come 5pm, Mount is at the vaccine centre, packing Pfizer vials into freezer bags full of ice to take out to GP practices. She turns on the press conference, and is flabbergasted to hear Johnson thank her personally, for her work rolling out the booster campaign. Her dad messages her almost immediately. “The prime minister just said your name!” he writes. 20 December Mount dashes to Asda to pick up bits for the Christmas meal. She’s so tired, she leaves her keys at the checkout. A member of the public flags her down. 23 December Mount’s final day in the office before Christmas. Across the country, Omicron cases are surging. There are 106,199 cases reported in England today: a new national record, to be broken tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. Testing labs are overwhelmed by the sheer number of people presenting for PCR tests. Government-issued lateral flow tests have run out. The local microbiology lab is so overwhelmed with PCRs, it has had to stop doing urine and sputum samples. Without the samples, they can’t find which specific infections the patients have, so Mount has been told to prescribe broader antibiotics than she would typically use. “We’ve spent years trying to avoid broader antibiotics because of the problems they can cause,” she says. “We might end up in a pickle next week with people with resistant infections.” At lunchtime, one of the Folly Lane nurses is getting ready to go out and vaccinate a shelter for rough sleepers. As the nurse is preparing to leave, Mount gets an email from her communications manager. The prime minister wants to video-call her at the homeless shelter, to thank her for the work she has been doing. “I said to the comms lady: ‘Are you sure you want me to do this? I’m known for speaking my mind.’” Mount has a break in between clinics, and she rushes to the shelter. They cram into a small meeting room. The prime minister is characteristically dishevelled and tries to fix the Teams connection halfway through. After 10 minutes, they click off. “If we’d had more time,” says Mount wryly, “I might have mentioned a few things about how best to communicate with us. But then he’d probably have said that his computer failed.” Afterwards, Mount and her team vaccinate 30 people at the homeless shelter, which feels amazing. “Sometimes the ones you get the biggest sense of achievement about are the smallest numbers,” she says. Wrapping the children’s presents on Christmas Eve, Mount realises to her dismay that she ordered far too many online, and sets some aside. “You overcompensate, don’t you?” 29 December Mount is at the vaccine centre. It’s ghostly quiet. They have space for 1,100 appointments, but only 250 people are booked in. Over Christmas, studies emerged indicating that Omicron is less deadly than earlier variants of the virus. Mount thinks this is why people aren’t bothering to book their boosters. “For someone in their 90s or who is immunosuppressed,” she sighs, “it might not be mild.” Around 11am, anti-vax protesters set up a table outside the centre. “You’re not being told the full picture,” a protester tells people as they leave the clinic. He hands them a leaflet. “How many jabs to freedom?” it reads. “Never before has a ‘vaccine’ required continuous top-up every few months! Surely your gut feeling tells you something isn’t right?” One of Mount’s team waves at the protesters cheerily through the window. “They had a poster last week with a picture of Madeleine McCann on it,” observes a volunteer, eating a biscuit. Mount asks the building manager if they can’t be moved on, but it’s public land so there’s nothing she can do. Around 2pm, one of the protesters starts shouting at patients in the observation room. She yells that everyone’s going to die, and it’s all a hoax. Mount tells the woman that she has to leave, at which point the woman falsely accuses her of assaulting her. Mount’s team forms a human chain around the woman, walking her out. The police arrive, investigate the woman’s claim of assault, conclude there’s no case to answer, and leave. The protesters linger outside for a while until a security guard arrives, then disappear. Afterwards, everyone is worked up. They debrief over cups of tea. Mount is disturbed. “The worry is that you don’t know who could be violent or aggressive towards you,” she says. 5 January Turnout is still low at the vaccine centre. Mount’s more pressing concern, however, is staffing. Two of her GPs are out with Covid, and two of her nurses. The agencies she would usually call for locums can’t help: the north-west has become the centre of Omicron. It’s a similar picture across the country: more than 35,000 NHS staff are off sick. In London, the military has been drafted into crisis-stricken hospitals. To prevent her remaining staff from contracting Covid, Mount seeks permission to purchase FFP3 masks out of Folly Lane funds. When fitted correctly, FFP3 masks are up to 100% effective at protecting the wearer from infection; surgical masks are only 40-80% effective. In Germany, such masks are mandatory on public transport. In the UK, FFP3 masks are only available to NHS staff performing aerosol-generating procedures. Despite this, when Javid visited an NHS hospital this month, he wore an FFP3 mask; he was photographed talking to an ICU doctor who was wearing a surgical mask. “We’re two years into this pandemic,” says the BMA’s Jameel. “We know that Covid is airborne, and we’re still telling general practice: ‘Here’s a flimsy mask. This will protect you.’” At Folly Lane, Mount drafts in a paramedic and pharmacist to deal with minor ailments, but it’s not enough, and they have to cancel a diabetic review clinic. She’s worried about patient safety should things get worse. “In the next two or three weeks,” Mount says, “it could get to the point where we just haven’t got the people. I don’t know what we’ll do.” When she has a moment to think, Mount asks herself how long she can continue working like this; how much longer she can keep driving herself at the expense of her family life, wellbeing and health. Not much longer, in all honesty. She has seen other GPs have heart attacks from the stress. She plans to get out by the time she’s 60, at the latest. “There’s no way I can do this until I’m 65,” she says. “No way.” Until then, Dr Mount and her colleagues hold together the crumbling edifice of primary care with exhaustion and goodwill. There may not be many GPs to replace her, if things carry on as they are. Some dates and details have been changed for patient privacy.",News/Society,‘As a doctor you want to help – not explain why patients must suffer’: one GP’s diary of this winter of discontent,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/as-a-doctor-you-want-to-help-not-explain-why-patients-must-suffer-one-gps-diary-of-this-winter-of-discontent
1/25/2022,"Neil Young has demanded that his music be removed from Spotify due to vaccine misinformation spread by podcaster Joe Rogan on the streaming service, saying: “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” In an open letter to his manager and record label that was posted to his website and later taken down, Young wrote: “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them. Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule.”  Young specified that his decision was motivated by The Joe Rogan Experience, which is currently Spotify’s most popular podcast and one of the biggest in the world. Rogan signed a US$100m deal in 2020 giving Spotify exclusive rights to the show. “With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world’s largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy,” he wrote, adding: “I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform … They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” The letter was addressed to his manager Frank Gironda and Tom Corson, the co-chairman and chief operating officer of Warner Records, which releases Young’s music through its Reprise Records imprint. Gironda confirmed the letter was authentic to The Daily Beast. “It’s something that’s really important to Neil. He’s very upset … we’re trying to figure this out right now.” Last month, 270 doctors, scientists and healthcare professionals signed an open letter requesting that Spotify implement a policy for dealing with misinformation because of Rogan’s “concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the Covid-19 pandemic”. The letter cited an episode in which Rogan interviewed Robert Malone, a virologist who was involved in the mRNA vaccine technology that led to some of the leading Covid-19 vaccines but has since been criticised for spreading vaccine misinformation. Both men were criticised for promoting several baseless conspiracy theories, including the false claim that hospitals are financially incentivised to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19, and Malone’s assertion that world leaders had hypnotised the public into supporting vaccines.

1/25/2022," The old Lammas meadows are bustling with life, the brambles along the chalk stream rowdy with communal chit-chat. Somewhere in the scrub, a parcel of linnets is unfolding. Earlier in the afternoon they rose from the alders, perhaps a couple of hundred birds, and danced as one over the sedges. Now, the little finches are settling down to roost, filling the bushes with their non-stop twittering. Unseen, but definitely not unheard.  I sludge through the boggy top meadow to the mud by the stream. Up ahead, the flame-licked willow tops resound with the noisy tidings of magpies. Most afternoons they congregate here in a pre-roost assembly, up to 30 birds jostling and trading places before diving into the safety of the wet scrub for the night. A sudden eruption from one of the shallow pools catches my attention. A wisp of snipe rises up. I can just make out four birds zigzagging away, melting into meadow. A few seconds later, they vanish back into the rushes. These are the first snipe I’ve seen here since last February, and their brief emergence is a burst of winter joy. Whistling wings overhead. Looking up, I realise I’m under the flight path of several mallards. They come in dribs and drabs: three, five, then a couple of pairs, flying in haphazard formation, quacking loud and low. Wheeling round in the failing light, each squadron ducks under the overhanging willows and splashes down in the disused watercress beds. No longer airborne, the raucous sord (from the Middle English sorde meaning to soar up in flight) transforms into a silent paddling of mallards. I ford the stream and slip out of the meadow through the kissing gate, full of the sights and sounds of birds gathering in parcels, tidings, wisps and paddlings. I almost expect to see crowds in the pub, busloads of commuters returning from work. But the main road is muted. Pedestrians edge past each other, trying to maintain a polite distance. Four masked passengers sit in the corners of the 98 bus. Ours is a world apart.
