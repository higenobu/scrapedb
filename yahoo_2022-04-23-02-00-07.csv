4/23/2022,"The airplane passenger Mike Tyson punched Wednesday night has a long criminal record, according to court records. Melvin Townsend III of Punta Gorda, Florida was listed in 2019 as having “habitual felony offender status,’’ when he was sentenced to 25 months for grand theft, according to court records with the Clerk of Circuit Court in Charlotte County, Florida. Townsend, 36, also has been convicted of fraud by identity theft, trafficking in property known to be stolen, use or possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription, court records show. The conviction of grand theft of more than $300 but less than $5,000 stemmed from an incident in which Townsend stole a trailer by hitching it to his truck and later told police, “I am sorry for everything and I was going to return the records,’’ according to court records. Video footage published Thursday by TMZ showed Tyson, the 55-year-old former champion boxer, punching Townsend on a Jet Blue flight at San Francisco International Airport bound for Miami after Townsend apparently badgered Tyson. ""Unfortunately, Mr. Tyson had an incident on a flight with an aggressive passenger who began harassing him and threw a water bottle at him while he was in his seat,"" a spokesperson representing Tyson told USA TODAY Sports. A woman who identified herself as Townsend’s sister said he is not taking calls and declined to comment further on the record.

4/23/2022,"The Walt Disney Co. has been silent this past week over the Florida Legislature's action to repeal the Reedy Creek Improvement District. That's the governing structure for Disney's Orlando-area properties. That silence leaves much unknown about how Disney will respond, and what its next steps will be. Under the legislation, the move would take effect in June 2023. The Legislature's action came in response to Disney criticism over the “Parental Rights in Education Act"" that Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law in March. The measure — which critics term the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill — includes provisions that limit instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K-3. A smaller world for Disney?: Florida lawmakers revoke special self-governing status Check your air fryer: Best Buy recalls some Insignia air fryer models because they can overheat and catch fire The company responded to the fallout from Disney employees and stockholders — both in an open letter to employees and during the company's annual stockholders' meeting. DeSantis and lawmakers took notice. Here's what we know about what transpired: Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek has taken criticism in recent months from some employees and shareholders over what his critics felt was Disney's muted response in opposing the Parental Rights in Education Act. Chapek last month sent a message addressed to Disney employees — ""but especially our LGBTQ+ community"" — about the legislation. ""Speaking to you, reading your messages and meeting with you have helped me better understand how painful our silence was,"" Chapek said. ""It is clear that this is not just an issue about a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights. You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights, and I let you down. I am sorry. We need to use our influence to promote that good by telling inclusive stories, but also by standing up for the rights of all."" Chapek read a statement at the company's annual stockholders' meeting explaining that tactic. ""We were opposed to the bill from the outset, but we chose not to take a public position on it, because we thought we could be more effective working behind the scenes, engaging directly with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,"" Chapek told stockholders. ""And we were hopeful that our long-standing relationships with those lawmakers would enable us to achieve a better outcome. But despite weeks of effort, we were ultimately unsuccessful. Certainly, the outcome in Florida was not what many of us were hoping for, especially our LGBTQ+ employees."" Some stockholders on both sides of the issue were not pleased with the company's efforts — and expressed those views during the shareholder question-and-answer portion of the meeting. One stockholder questioned why Chapek and a group of LGBTQ+ employees were planning to meet with DeSantis, when the governor's views were clear on the legislation. Another read into the meeting record comments from his daughter — a Disney employee — who felt the company did not do enough to fight the legislation; should not have donated to politicians who supported the bill; and does not have enough of an LGBTQ+ representation in its mainstream Disney shows and movies. She termed Disney's initial efforts on the legislation ""beyond disappointing."" In contrast, another stockholder complained to Chapek that ""your recent Magical Pride Days and your upcoming LGBTQ Pride March this year is a blatant attempt at indoctrinating children and attendees towards a certain political ideology."" He also expressed concern that transgender themes are getting into Disney creative content. ""My question to you today is: Would it not be beneficial both to you and the millions of Disney lovers around the world to ditch the politicization and gender ideology from your content aimed at children, and instead try to win back the trust of families by sliding away from politics altogether? And reverting back to the magic and innocence that has been the founding motive for its success?"" ""I think all the participants in today's call can see how difficult it is to try to thread the needle between the extreme polarization of political viewpoints we have as shareholders,"" he told shareholders. ""Certainly, our shareholders follow the general distribution of our audience in general and America and the globe, in terms of having different points of view."" Chapek has announced a multifaceted approach to addressing the issues. Among its efforts, Disney is taking action to combat the spread of legislation like the Parental Rights in Education Act approved by the Florida Legislature and signed into law by DeSantis. Chapek said Disney is: Increasing its support for advocacy groups to combat similar legislation in other states, including signing the Human Rights Campaign's statement opposing such legislative efforts. Pledging $5 million to organizations working to protect LGBTQ+ rights. Working to create ""a new framework for our political giving that will ensure our advocacy better reflects our values."" Halting political donations in Florida, pending this review. Chapek said Disney likes ""to celebrate those different points of view, but, really, what we want Disney to be is a place where people can come together and place their differences aside, and it's my goal to make sure that that continues to be the case, where Disney is a unifying force, not a divisive force. My opinion is that when someone walks down Main Street and comes in the gates of our parks, they put their differences aside, and they look at what they have as a shared belief — a shared belief of Disney magic, hopes, dreams and imagination and bringing people together."" ""We stand with our LGBTQ+ community going forward, and will continue to make an impact,"" Chapek said at the shareholder meeting. ""I truly believe we are an infinitely better and stronger company because of our LGBTQ+ community."" Chapek told employees in his email. ""I missed the mark in this case, but am an ally you can count on — and I will be an outspoken champion for the protections, visibility and opportunity you deserve.""

4/23/2022,"For the first time since Russia launched its all-out war against Ukraine on Feb. 24, Vladimir Putin on Thursday publicly flaunted his role as commander-in-chief, ordering his defense minister to halt plans to storm the last bastion of Ukrainian military resistance in Mariupol. “I consider the proposed storming of the industrial zone unnecessary. I order you to cancel it,” he told Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in a televised meeting, referring to Russian troops’ bid to storm the Azovstal plant where the last remaining Ukrainian troops in the city have been fending off a full Russian invasion for weeks. Ukraine has warned that many civilians remain trapped inside the plant as well. In remarks bound to raise eyebrows after Moscow has spent nearly two months trying to cover up its own devastating losses in Ukraine—during which time they lost some 20,000 troops, according to Ukrainian estimates—Putin went on to claim his decision stemmed from a desire to protect human lives. “This is an instance when we must think… I mean we must always think, but in the given situation even more so… about the preservation of the lives and health of our soldiers and officers,” he said. “There’s no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities,” he said. “Block off this industrial area so that not even a fly can get through.” Putin has ordered Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to call off the storm of Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant in order to ""protect the lives of Russian soldiers and officers""

Of course he said nothing about Ukrainian lives pic.twitter.com/QJ1FdsYYlB — Francis Scarr (@francska1) April 21, 2022 His remarks come after a Ukrainian commander holed up in the plant issued a desperate appeal to the international community earlier this week, warning that “hundreds of civilians” were trapped there and there were “only a few days, or even hours” left for them amid heavy bombardment by Russian troops. On the eve of Putin’s announcement, the Ukrainian presidential administration had also called for negotiations in the city “without any conditions” to “save” Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Bizarrely, Putin went on to congratulate Shoigu on what he described as the successful “liberation” of Mariupol, despite the fact that the city has essentially been wiped off the face of the Earth after nearly two months of Russian attacks. (A 91-year-old Jewish survivor of the Nazi occupation of Mariupol in 1941 was among those killed during Russia’s siege, making Putin’s claims of the Kremlin acting to “de-Nazify” Ukraine all the more laughable.) For many Russia observers, the unexpected announcement was seen as a veiled admission that the Kremlin is becoming aware of its need to save face in light of mounting reports of disillusionment among Russian troops, major losses, and perhaps even the sinking of the country’s most powerful battleship, the Moskva, which sparked outrage even among some of Putin’s most loyal propaganda figures. (Moscow’s repeated claim that all of the 500 or so sailors on board were rescued, and that the ship was not downed by Ukrainian missiles, has been torn to shreds by family members of those on board who disputed those claims in interviews with independent media outlets.) And even as Putin lauded what he described as a successful operation to take control of Mariupol on Thursday, the city’s mayor said there was new evidence of Russian troops going to great lengths to mask civilian deaths and possibly their own military losses. “The locals have told us that near Manhush [outside Mariupol] they have dug a 30-meter mass grave and are transporting bodies there in trucks that they are trying to hide,” Vadym Boychenko said in televised comments. Ukrainian authorities have said that up to 22,000 civilians have been killed in the city since Russia’s takeover on March 1. Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/23/2022,"Chechen fighters working with the Russian forces in Mariupol stood in front of a burning building and claimed they have ‘cleansed and destroyed’ the Ukrainian city, in a video aired Friday. The video was posted to the telegram account of Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Republic of Chechnya, and a key ally to Putin. Chechen forces are supporting Russia in their war with Ukraine and are fighting as part of Russia’s military operation. Though the Chechen unit boasts about destroying and cleansing the city, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pushed back and said that Mariupol is, “A city that continues to resist Russia, despite everything the occupiers say.” He claimed that the horrors in and around the city of Mariupol are difficult for anyone outside of it to understand. Satellite images outside the city reportedly show the presence of mass graves.
