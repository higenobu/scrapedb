12/26/2021,"The Reith Lectures (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsConsumed By Desire (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsLook at What You Could Have Won (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsJohn Grant’s Beautiful Creatures Storyglass The Reith Lectures this year have been an absolutely terrifying dystopian vision of the obliteration of the human race, all delivered in the gentle tones and reasoned arguments of Prof Stuart Russell, an artificial intelligence expert from the University of California. Russell speaks so mildly, he could be a family therapist; though he isn’t, as he said in passing in response to a question from another professor, Rachel Franklin, after his fourth lecture, which went out last week.  In it, Russell discussed how humans might regulate our prospective new robot overlords. In his other three talks, he has been telling stories of how AI can affect – and already is affecting – war and economics, corporations and climate change; essentially, how artificial intelligence is taking over. Also, that unless we’re very careful with our computer coding, this may not be a good thing. “On the question of the long-term safety of general-purpose AI systems we’re … still some way away from knowing exactly how to define what the algorithm templates should be,” he said in the “sorry, you have terminal cancer” tones of a caring surgeon. “We have to solve those technical problems.” Last week’s lecture was intended to give us a bit of hope, as Russell suggested how we might wrest power away from the intelligent machines that are going to destroy us. All we have to do, he said, is make sure they’re programmed so that they understand they don’t know everything. “We have to build AI systems that know they don’t know the true objective, even though it’s what they must pursue,” he said. “The robot defers to the human.” To which the only response, as an artificial intelligence non-expert and parent of non-deferential teenagers, is: “Yeah, right.” All the questions to Russell after his lecture highlighted the ways his idea could fail, from competing companies (or countries) not sharing information to the (lack of) principles the regulations of these AI beings might be based on. Franklin’s “family therapist” question was this: if a husband and wife can’t agree on something, how will a domestic AI appliance know which human to defer to? Russell didn’t really answer. He is clearly a lovely man who believes in the benevolence of other humans and the wholesomeness of their desires. I feel he might benefit from listening to Philippa Perry’s new series, which is, coincidentally, about desire. Perry’s agony aunt column for the Observer Magazine shows her amazing ability to reframe difficult human emotions in easy-to-understand ways, and in last week’s episode of Consumed By Desire, the first of three, she used this talent, as well as her abundant charm, to get clever people to unpick what desire actually is. It’s not, as we might assume, something to do with sex (though it can be, obviously), but more a feeling engendered by our interaction with other humans. Perry talked to psychologist Adam Phillips, who linked desire to neediness and said that, although society tells us that neediness is embarrassing, and we should all be aiming for independence, adults are as dependent on others as babies are, and that is fine. Producer Martin Williams included the interactions between Perry and himself in the show, presumably to illustrate that desire comes from humans communicating with each other. This was sweet, though a little distracting. Anyhow, I desire to hear the next two episodes. Another comforting Radio 4 programme (can you tell I’ve been trying to avoid Real News?) came from journalist James McMahon, who took a tour around the 1980s/90s ITV darts quiz show Bullseye in Look at What You Could Have Won. This might have been a programme just for us oldies, but McMahon was clever enough to involve young people right from the start. Twenty-four-year-old Lana and 22-year-old Kamiah, neither of whom had ever seen Bullseye before, highlighted its charms: cool “random” prizes, real cash counted out and handed over, contestants only answering questions if their partner landed their darts. Also, its un-charms. It showcased working-class people, for sure, but only the white ones and mostly the men. McMahon’s presentation was a lovely thing – interested, intelligent, cheeky – making for one of the most heartwarming shows I heard all week. And for anyone who wants a little more of that valve-toasting stuff, may I recommend musician John Grant’s new podcast, Beautiful Creatures? Yes, he’s chatting to famous people, but he’s doing so in a lovely John Grant way. Last week’s episode, with Linda Thompson, was a delight. “I listened to a song of yours today,” said Grant, “called You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere.” “You absolute idiot – why did you listen to that?” spluttered Thompson. “It’s terrible!” Really, how can AI ever be unpredictable enough to mimic human interaction?",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: The Reith Lectures; Consumed By Desire; Look at What You Could Have Won; John Grant’s Beautiful Creatures,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/25/the-reith-lectures-2021-review-stuart-russell-consumed-by-desire-philippa-perry-look-at-what-you-could-have-won-bullseye-john-grant-beautiful-creatures
12/26/2021,"On Tuesday, a Christmas miracle. Not only did my niece, nephew and I all test negative for Covid, so did the cast of the Old Vic’s production of A Christmas Carol. After days of uncertainty, our longed-for outing was on. I warned Edith and William in advance that I would probably cry and so it came to pass. I wept copiously, while they rolled their eyes. In the interval, I tried to explain that because Dickens’s story has to do with regret – with choices wrongly made and paths never taken – its wondrous power only grows as you get older. What I didn’t tell them, wanting (probably naively) to preserve their innocence, is that its central message could at this point hardly be more necessary or less likely to be heeded.  How loudly the “be kind” brigade trumpet their compassion on social media! And yet how rarely, on the part of their noisiest and seemingly most virtuous members, does this involve any kind of challenge. Their mercy extending only to those of whose behaviour they wholly approve, they could hardly be more different from dear Bob Cratchit and sweet-hearted Fred, both of whom love Ebenezer Scrooge – or try to love him – in spite of his great miserliness, and who, when he wakes on Christmas morning a changed man, accept in good faith his newfound generosity, the former resisting the urge to call “for help and a strait-waistcoat”, the latter practically shaking his uncle’s hand clean off as he welcomes him into his home. In the Sheffield suburb of Loxley, a local teacher, Dan Eaton, has found a carved cross that he believes marks the site of the birthplace of Robin Hood: a discovery made, somewhat conveniently, behind the playground of his school. Naturally, the council is thrilled. Here is more grist for its “Bring Robin Home” campaign (Hood has been associated with Loxley since the 16th century). But the people of Nottingham remain unconvinced. “Robin Hood is as much from Sheffield as Jarvis Cocker is from Nottingham,” says Merlita Bryan, a Labour councillor and the current sheriff of Nottingham. For her, Hood is properly Robin of Locksley, named for a long-lost village in Nottinghamshire. When I was a child, my father, who lived in Loxley, was quite determined to claim Hood as a Yorkshireman, a conviction born mostly of the fact that such a proto-socialist could not possibly have come from somewhere as far south as Nottingham. But out and about, his stories weren’t hard to believe. It was on ghostly Loxley Common, where the bodies of criminals were once gibbeted, that outlaws were supposed to have lain in wait for travellers from York. Walking our lurcher in the gloaming, I always felt afraid; as the sun sank, you practically ran towards the shop that marked the border with civilisation and not just because it was the only place for miles about that had a reliable supply of the semi-illicit and noisy sweet known as Space Dust. From Loxley, you can look across the valley to Lodge Moor, Dungworth and Stannington, places where, at this time of year, people traditionally gather in the pub to sing village carols. My favourite Stannington carol is Hail Smiling Morn, a version of a glee (or part song) composed in 1810 by the comically named Reginald Spofforth. Its words (I know them by heart) describe a sunrise that “tips the hills with gold… at whose bright presence darkness flies away”: lines that speak so marvellously well to this time of year, when the winter solstice has passed and we begin to inch ever closer to the light.

12/26/2021,"Outsourced security guards at London’s Great Ormond Street hospital are planning to walk out for six weeks because they are being denied full sick pay and other standard NHS employment rights by a company owned by a leading Conservative donor, Michael Ashcroft. The guards, who are employed by Carlisle Support Services, which is owned by former Tory treasurer and deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, are desperate to be taken in-house by the children’s hospital because they fear the devastating financial consequences of falling ill. “It is hard to believe, but I do not get sick pay. What this means is if I go to work, I put myself and others in danger. If I stay at home, I don’t make rent,” said Erica Rasheed, who has been working at the hospital since March.  The world-renowned hospital’s 36 security guards are only entitled to statutory sick pay, which is just £96.35 a week, whereas NHS staff at the hospital, including in-house cleaners, get up to six months of full pay when ill. This means the security guards have to survive on less than £14 a day if they stay away from work. They are, however, entitled to full pay when self-isolating with Covid. “I’ve only been off one time – I have not taken any other sick leave in four years. I have to go to work when I’m ill,” said Peter Akintoye, a security guard, who has worked at the hospital since 2017. “It’s not just me – it is almost all of us. We cannot afford to be sick. We still have to come to work. We are left with no other option.” The guards, who earn just over £11 an hour, put themselves and their families at risk during the pandemic to help medical staff, sometimes escorting infectious patients, accompanied by paramedics, into the hospital. Now the hospital is facing another wave of the virus as the Omicron variant sweeps London. “It is dangerous for us. We are on the frontline. We walk around the whole hospital and deal with parents,” said Rasheed. The guards, who took three days of strike action earlier this month, will be walking out again in January. They claim they are being denied a range of employment rights enjoyed by their NHS colleagues, including full maternity pay, extra payments for unsociable hours and employer pension contributions. They are not paid more for working night shifts. “We are treated as second-tier staff,” said Akintoye, who has three children under nine. “There has to be some dignity and respect. It is so unfair.” The predominantly black and Asian guards argue they are being indirectly discriminated against because the largely white in-house workforce has superior terms and conditions. They are taking the hospital to an employment tribunal. “We are looked down on because we are not white, because we are immigrants,” said Rasheed. “I don’t doubt it at all.” Great Ormand Street staff receive eight weeks of full maternity pay and 18 weeks of half maternity pay – but the guards only get the statutory minimum, which is 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks and then no more than £151.97 a week. Rasheed, who is three months’ pregnant, dreads the prospect of having to get by on the legal minimum when her baby is born. “Now I’m pregnant I’m more worried than before. Maternity pay is worse than sick pay,” she said. “We can’t live on £650 or so a month [after six weeks] when our rent is £1,300 a month and our bills are £1,500 a month. Then there is food and transport. And stuff for the baby. We’re going to struggle. My husband will have to kill himself to find more work.” Carlisle Support Services, which generated revenues of £65m and profit before tax of almost £1.3m in 2019, is a supplier of outsourced cleaners, guards and retail staff in the UK. Ashcroft, who lives in Belize, has ultimate control of the firm as he holds more than half of its shares. Ashcroft, whose business empire is estimated to be worth in excess of £1.2bn, donated at least £10m to the Tories up to 2010. He has started donating to the party once more in recent years, including more than £200,000 since 2020. Ashcroft became a Conservative life peer in 2000 but was dogged by controversy about his tax status as he remained a “non dom” for 10 years, meaning his permanent home was not in the UK, so he did not pay UK tax on overseas earnings. He resigned his seat in the House of Lords in 2015 but retained his peerage. Petros Elia, general secretary of the United Voices of the World union, which represents the guards, accused Ashcroft’s firm and Great Ormand Street of ignoring their plight. “At a time when our NHS could soon be at breaking point, the refusal to give the security guards equality with their NHS counterparts tells you all you need to know about outsourcing. It’s all about profits and saving costs at the expense of worker wellbeing,” he said. Carlisle Support Services said the hospital’s security team’s terms and conditions of employment were transferred from the previous provider, when it took over the service in August. It said it was a large and ethical employer that recognised the right of employees to take lawful industrial action. It said the security team at the hospital earned more than the London living wage. It noted Ashcroft was not involved in any of the day-to-day operations of the company or the negotiation of client contracts. “At all times, Carlisle has and will maintain that all statutory employment provisions are offered to all employees,” the firm said in a statement. Great Ormond Street hospital said it respected and valued the security team’s contribution, particularly during the pandemic. It said it worked with an external provider approved by the Security Industry Authority to ensure a resilient and properly regulated security service. It said it had recently invited all members of the team to a series of staff meetings to discuss any concerns.",News/Law,Great Ormond Street children’s hospital guards to strike in dispute over sick pay,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/25/great-ormond-street-childrens-hospital-guards-to-strike-in-dispute-over-sick-pay
12/26/2021,"For decades, five families in Bruges have run the tourist boats that chug serenely along the beautiful Flemish city’s picturesque canals. Day in, day out, the guides describe the medieval belfry, low-sweeping bridges and rich history of this “Venice of the north”. But there may be stormy waters ahead for the boaters of Bruges. There is talk that Chinese investors and, even worse, people from Ghent, known locally as Stroppendragers or noose-bearers, could make waves.  To comply with EU law, the municipality will, in 2027, end the existing licensing regime, after which concessions will be open to tender, and competition encouraged. With the boating companies also obliged to invest in electric boats – at €200,000 a vessel, double the cost of a diesel engine – the future is uncertain. A wary eye is being cast at boat companies in Ghent, a rival city since the Battle of Beverhoutsveld in 1382. The nickname of Stroppendragers for Ghent dwellers was earned after the gentry there were forced by the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, in 1540 to parade with ropes around their necks after a failed rebellion. “The five shipping companies have been providing tourist round-trips for years, some even since 1905,” councillor Geert Van Tieghem, from the N-VA, a conservative Flemish party, told Het Nieuwsblad. “That is a piece of nautical heritage that we absolutely must cherish. “Now that the market is opening up, the concern is understandable. The economic market is large. You never know when people show interest from China. Or from Ghent, where there are also boats. It is important to give the Bruges shipping companies a little more legal certainty when they make such large investments.” Jos Michielsens, from the boat company Venice Van Het Noorden, which has been a proud user of a jetty near the city’s old fish market, the Huidenvettersplein, since the 1950s, said it could be the end of an era. “We are asked to make such a heavy investment, but we are not assured that we will be able to reap the benefits,” he said. “That is upsetting and makes me fearful of the future. We can’t help but go with it – it’s with the knife at the throat. If the state obliges you to make a certain investment in your home, then you do that too, right?” The alderman for tourism in Bruges, Philip Pierins, said it was necessary for the licensing procedure to be “transparent” and that the concessions would now be time-limited rather than permanent. “The city of Bruges engaged a law firm to carry out a legal screening of the existing municipal bylaw on boat trips,” Pierins said. “This screening showed that the duration of the licences for the current licence-holders could be extended indefinitely, and because the current licence-holders were always given priority in the context of the application procedure, it was virtually impossible for another interested market-player to obtain a licence.” The obligation to replace diesel boats with electric vessels has been accompanied by municipal funding to help the companies establish charging-points at their jetties. A 2024 deadline for making the transition from diesel has been extended to 2027. The regulated price for a tourist trip has also increased from €10 to €12, he said. Pierins added: “It is therefore not the case that they are ‘putting a knife to their throats’, as they seem to indicate. They are not obliged to have a full electric fleet by the end of the licence period, but every old diesel boat they replace must be an electric boat from now on. “Another condition to which they are committed is that every shipping company from now on offers at least one digital payment option, in addition to the existing option to pay in cash,” he said.",News/World news,Argy-bargy in Bruges: canal boat operators forced to let outsiders ply their trade,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/25/argy-bargy-in-bruges-canal-boat-operators-forced-to-let-outsiders-ply-their-trade
