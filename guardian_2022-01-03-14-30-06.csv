1/3/2022,"Former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is set to make a globe-trotting start to 2022 as he ramps up his campaign to defeat Brazil’s far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, with a series of international trips to the US, China, Russia and Mexico. Twenty years after being elected Brazil’s first working-class president, in 2002, the veteran leftwinger is gearing up for an electrifying bid to reclaim power in next October’s presidential election.  The Guardian understands that Lula, 76, is likely to formally announce his candidacy in March, shortly after his Workers’ party (PT) celebrates the 42nd anniversary of its foundation on 10 February 1980. Simultaneously, the politician, who governed from 2003 to 2010 during the early years of a commodity-fuelled boom, will make a series of overseas trips that allies say are designed to repair the South American country’s international reputation and denounce Bolsonaro’s threat to Brazil’s young democracy. “President Lula needs to travel the world to rebuild the bridges that were destroyed by Bolsonaro and to denounce the great risk Bolsonaro continues to pose to Brazilian democracy,” said Alexandre Padilha, a former Lula minister and PT congressman. Lula’s first trip is expected to be to Mexico in January, where he is likely to be received by its leftwing president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. During a recent visit to Argentina, Lula was welcomed by its leftwing leaders, Alberto Fernández and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and talked up the possibility of a progressive revival across Latin America. Trips to the US, China and Russia are also planned for the first quarter of 2022 while visits to Italy, Portugal and the UK are also on the cards. In November, Lula made a four-nation tour of Europe, during which he met the now chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, and was invited to the Élysée Palace by Emmanuel Macron. Padilha said it was essential that Lula alerted the world over fears Bolsonaro might refuse to recognise the election result just as his political idol, Donald Trump, did in the US. “This isn’t just an ordinary electoral battle. We are going to face a historic movement in which a neofascist movement in Brazil led by Bolsonaro must be defeated.” With less than a year until the election, Lula appears poised to beat Bolsonaro, whose ratings have plunged amid soaring inflation and a devastating Covid crisis that has killed more than 615,000 people and hammered the economy. One recent poll gave Lula a 27-point advantage over Bolsonaro and suggested he was close to a first-round victory. Cláudio Couto, a political scientist from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said much could change between now and the 2 October vote. “But everything suggests that at the very least Lula has a place in the second round. The question is, who will join him?” Most observers still believe the answer is Bolsonaro, who retains a hardcore support base of about 20% of voters and hopes Auxílio Brasil, a new social welfare programme, will win him back support among poor people. But Bolsonaro’s chances have been dented by a rightwing challenge from his former justice minister Sergio Moro, who resigned from the cabinet in April 2020 accusing the president of trying to meddle in the federal police. Moro, a former judge who helped force Lula from the 2018 presidential campaign before joining Bolsonaro’s government, recently announced his return to politics and appears third in polls. Couto said a “fratricidal war” between Moro and Bolsonaro could boost Lula’s campaign by splitting the Brazilian right. “I suspect Bolsonaro is probably very irritated, particularly with Moro. Bolsonaro and his sons have gone on the attack against him and this shows that they’ve grasped the danger of Moro stealing his place [in the second round].” Couto said Lula’s globetrotting was partly about re-engaging with foreign governments before what would be his third term as president. Mostly, however, the journeys were aimed at a domestic audience with Lula trying to contrast his statesmanlike travels with the international isolation of Bolsonaro, who has alienated key international partners including Joe Biden’s US, Xi Jinping’s China and EU leaders such as France’s Macron. Couto said Bolsonaro was considered a global “espalha rodinha” (pain in the neck) – “the kind of guy who makes everyone flee when he joins conversation”. “This is a trump card for Lula,” Couto said, adding that even Brazil’s economic elites, who helped elect Bolsonaro, now realised Lula commanded international respect, while Bolsonaro was widely rejected for his handling of coronavirus and the environment. Padilha said the world saw Lula as “a popular and experienced politician who favours dialogue … and was interested in protecting the environment and reducing poverty and inequality. Bolsonaro’s image is of destruction. Of a far-right leader who is anti-environment [and] anti-vaccine and condemned Brazil to the greatest human tragedy in our history.”",News/World news,Rebuilding bridges: Former president’s mission to defeat Bolsonaro in Brazil,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-brazilian-former-president-mission-to-defeat-bolsonaro
1/3/2022,"Australia’s 2021 was its coolest year since 2012, but still half a degree hotter than average according to data from the Bureau of Meteorology. A dominant La Niña weather pattern kept temperatures lower than in recent years and total rainfall across the country was only slightly higher than average.  Across the bureau’s temperature records going back to 1910, 2021 was the 17th hottest, with the national temperature 0.56C warmer than the average between 1961 and 1990. Australia has not had a year where the temperature was below the long-term average since 2000. The hottest year on record is 2019, which was 1.51C above average. The data shows 2021 was the 28th wettest year nationwide since 1900 with a total of 507mm – only slightly above the annual average of 466mm. The wettest year on record remains 1974, when the bureau’s records show 760mm fell. Neil Plummer, a climatologist and consultant at Monash University’s climate change communication research hub, said 2021 had been a “signature La Niña” year. “We get a lot of stronger south-easterly winds flowing in to tropical areas and we get more convection and more high clouds and more rainfall in northern and eastern Australia. “That’s what we’ve seen since the back end of 2020. This is a signature La Niña over Australia.” New South Wales and the ACT had the coolest year since 1996, with the overall temperature only 0.15C above average. NSW recorded its wettest November since at least 1900, and 2021 was its sixth wettest year on record. In Victoria, the average temperature was the lowest since 2004, but still 0.26C above average. Rainfall was 36mm above the state’s annual average of 663mm. Queensland’s statewide temperature was 1C above average, making it the coolest year since 2012. Rainfall was also slightly above average. Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and South Australia were all slightly warmer than average. The only state and territory to record below average rainfall was South Australia, which dipped below its average by just 4mm. The bureau declared the La Niña in November. Australia's east coast is likely to be wetter than average in Jan-March, incl most of #Qld. Parts of #WA and #Tas are likely to be drier. #Flood risk has increased with Nov being wettest on record.

I wouldn’t say they’ve disappeared, but it’s going to be increasingly hard to get them.” The bureau will release more information about the climate of 2021 later this week. Last month the bureau’s climate outlook for the next three months said there was an increased chance of “unusually high minimum temperatures” for January to March over much of the country. Rainfall was likely to be above average for eastern Australia, with northern Queensland and coastal NSW in particular having a very wet January to March.",News/Australia news,La Niña weather pattern keeps temperatures in Australia down but 2021 still hotter than average,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/la-nina-weather-pattern-keeps-temperatures-in-australia-down-but-2021-still-hotter-than-average
1/3/2022,"Something about the sticky floors of the dingy nightclub Gemma Moore was at on the New South Wales central coast gave her the sense she was about to get sick. “It was a good night, but I just really didn’t feel comfortable being out,” Moore said. “There weren’t any QR codes and the staff weren’t wearing masks. And I remember thinking: someone in here has Covid.”  A few days later, the 28-year-old care worker’s hunch proved correct when she, her boyfriend and her housemate all showed symptoms and tested positive to Covid. “It took me ages to believe it was Covid,” Moore said. “I couldn’t wrap my head around it. I had had a negative rapid antigen test and it all had felt so far away. “I also really didn’t want to have it, because that meant the people I saw in the last two days, my clients, were exposed and I was really worried about them.” From the moment they received their PCR results, the three went into isolation, joining thousands of others across the country despite efforts by political leaders to open up the country ahead of Christmas. “We can’t leave the house,” Moore says. “It feels like this invisible barrier – we’ve all been saying it. We can go to the end of the driveway and watch people from a distance as they walk or drive past, but we can’t go any further. “It’s weird to feel normal, but also know that we’re infectious. It’s weird to think that just by me going out in the community I could share the love.” Moore, however, says they are among the lucky ones. With a stable housing situation, an ocean view and their other housemates visiting their families for the holidays, they have avoided a situation where they would have had to isolate from each other as well as the world. Their mornings are spent apart, but they share meals and wait out the time in the afternoons. Anna Mazzone had a different experience when she travelled to Adelaide from Berlin via Melbourne, and ended up spending almost three weeks in isolation over Christmas. It was the 35-year-old’s first trip home in two years to visit her parents and she had initially quarantined with her brother in a small unit in Adelaide. Over the course of the first week, the siblings couldn’t avoid each other in the “one big space”. Then, on the final day, Mazzone tested positive. “Unfortunately, I must have caught it travelling. When I landed in Melbourne, I got a test that was negative and I was meant to do a final test, and that was positive,” Mazzone said. While her brother, who was vaccinated, remained Covid-free, the unexpected result caused chaos. The pair immediately tried to physically distance as best they could while they worked out what to do next. Though they were supposed to receive a call with instructions, none ever came. Mazzone said they spent the day calling health authorities for details but had a “different answer for every person we spoke to”. Mazzone decided to take matters into her own hands by booking an Airbnb at a cost of $500 a day to isolate for 14 days, which has left her in debt. “It feels like it’s the first wave in Adelaide, like no one’s experienced Covid before. Even coming in through Melbourne, it seems like no one knew what the right thing to do was.” Others like Alex, who is chronically ill, began isolating as a pre-emptive measure when they saw case numbers start to climb, in a practice known as “shielding”. The 30-year-old, who did not wish to be identified and who lives with myalgic encephalomyelitis, otherwise known as chronic fatigue syndrome, spends most of their day in bed and relies on the help of their carer. They have struggled to apply for the NDIS, and have had to privately fundraise to pay for care. Alex, who is vaccinated, is not just worried about dying from Covid, but after-effects like long Covid that will make their circumstances worse. Their isolation has taken on “another layer” as their carer and two friends who helped with groceries have been exposed, and are isolating while waiting for test results. Until their results came, Alex said they would be on their own and having to triage basic tasks. “Basically the level of care that I need is very high, so whenever I have to exert myself, like cleaning stuff, sanitising all the stuff coming in, it takes so much out of me,” Alex said. “I just prioritise where I put my energy each day. So it’s like: OK, I’m meant to shower today, do I shower, do I make sure I’m having three meals?” Alex said for all the talk about “living with Covid” and allowing it to spread, disabled people were being left to carry the cost – often without government support. “It’s not just disabled people shielding, but the people who care for us, that we rely on,” they said. “There’s a shortage of people who are caring for us. “A lot of people are going to wind up getting disabled from long Covid, and the system already doesn’t support chronically ill, disabled people enough.”",News/Australia news,Tens of thousands of Australians are in isolation ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/thousands-of-australians-are-isolating-with-covid-heres-how-some-of-them-are-coping
