12/16/2021,"A Louisiana judge is facing backlash after video surfaced that appears to show her and her family using racial slurs. Judge Michelle Odinet told KLFY News 10 on Tuesday: ""I was given a sedative at the time of the video."" Civil rights organizations have called on Odinet to resign. A Louisiana judge blamed sedatives after a surveillance video surfaced that appears to show her and her family spewing racial slurs in the aftermath of a burglary attempt. Lafayette City Court Judge Michelle Odinet told Louisiana's KLFY News 10 on Tuesday that, ""I was given a sedative at the time of the video. I have zero recollection of the video and the disturbing language used during it."" A video purportedly showing security footage from Odinet's home emerged on social media on Monday. In the video, several people can be heard laughing and giggling as they watch surveillance footage of a burglary attempt. In the video, a male can be heard saying the N-word twice and a woman responds also saying the N-word twice. ""Like a roach,"" she says as she laughs. In her statement to KLFY, Odinet said her ""mental state was fragile"" following the alleged burglary. The judge added: ""Anyone who knows me and my husband knows this is contrary to the way we live our lives. I am deeply sorry and ask for your forgiveness and understanding as my family, and I deal with the emotional aftermath of this armed burglary."" The Lafayette Police Department confirmed to local media that an attempted burglary of a vehicle happened at Odinet's home at around 2 a.m. Saturday. However, Lafayette police Sgt. Paul Mouton told KLFY that the suspect — a Black man — did not have a weapon in his possession at the time of his arrest, even though Odinet described the incident as an ""armed burglary."" A slew of local politicians and civil rights groups have since spoken out. The city's mayor-president said he was ""disgusted and appalled"" by the video and the Lafayette Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has called on Odinet to resign.

12/16/2021,"Fox News’ Dan Bongino and Geraldo Rivera got into it — again — Tuesday night. This time, Bongino accused his fellow “Hannity” guest of “backstabbing” former President Donald Trump by saying that Trump himself incited the deadly Capitol riot. “The obvious difference between the riot that happened on January 6 and the 500-odd that you correctly cite as concerning and damaging to America — to our psyche, to our physical wellbeing — is that this was a riot that was unleashed, incited and inspired by the president of the United States.” Host Sean Hannity interrupted, telling Rivera that was his “opinion” and that Trump only asked his followers to march “peacefully” to the Capitol after his speech that day. However, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Monday revealed during a House committee hearing that multiple Fox News hosts texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows during the riot, urging him to get Trump to intervene and stop the chaos. Rivera jumped on the opportunity to bring that up. “I beg you, Sean, to remember the frame of mind you were in when you wrote that text on January 6 and when Laura [Ingraham] did and when Brian [Kilmeade] did and when [Donald Trump Jr.] did. Remember that concern you had. Remember the frustration you had at our beloved 45th president,” Rivera said. When it was his turn to speak, Bongino told Rivera, “The backstabbing of the president you are engaging in is really disgusting and it’s really vile.” Rivera said he resented that and had always supported Trump.

12/16/2021,"Andre Olivas, from Buffalo, New York, is suing the Los Angeles Country Sheriff’s Department, multiple deputies, and Sheriff Alex Villanueva after cellphone video footage showed deputies holding the man down and hitting him in the head during a traffic stop for expired tags in Long Beach, California. Olivas’ attorney, James DeSimone, filed the excessive force lawsuit on behalf on Wednesday, Dec. 8, telling Fox 11 that the deputies’ actions during the stop went “beyond excessive force.” Olivas, who is Black, was pulled over while leaving a gas station last February because the vehicle he rented for work-related use had expired tags, the outlet reported. The 28-year-old told reporters that he was in Southern California trying to expand his business — he owned a transport and moving company. “His explanation to me was, usually in his experience, if there’s an expired license plate or bad license plate, usually the truck is stolen,” Olivas said. The man said he told the deputies that he was unaware the tags had expired. Olivas said he gave the officers “the same respect I give my mom.” “For lack of a better word, I’m not trying to dance around anything,” he added. However, things soon turn took a violent turn when he could not find the registration and the deputies asked him step out of the vehicle. Olivas said in the interview that when he responded by asking to speak to a supervisor the deputies attacked him. His suit says he was hit several times and restrained him to the point that he couldn’t breathe. “After slamming me on the hood of his vehicle, he started to Mace me near my face.” Olivas said, noting that at times he almost lost consciousness. “Oh my God, I’m scared.’ I’m just trying not to do anything to make them think I’m trying to struggle or fight,” he recalled of the incident. The man claims the incident left him with permanent brain and emotional trauma. The video that Olivas and his attorney says shows the deputies beating the New York state man apparently was recorded by a nearby witness with a cellphone. In a statement to FOX11, the LASD says it hasn’t seen Olivas’ complaint yet and was not going to speak on the matter now, adding that “Sheriff Alex Villanueva has been the most transparent Sheriff in history and has implemented historic reforms in order to address potential misconduct.” “I kind of feel like that’s what really escalated it, was me asking to speak to a supervisor,” Olivas expressed. “Everything I wanted to do was comply and give them the information that they need. To be honest, [I was] scared for my life. I didn’t know what was going on because it was without any warning.” More news from our partners: ‘I Got You on Camera, Bro’: Wisconsin City Forced to Release Body Camera Footage In Response to Claims Officer Planted Evidence During Traffic Stop ‘You Got Me Speechless ‘| Deion Sanders Wins Eddie Robinson Award, Jackson State Cleans Up Postseason Awards Two Friends Left Steady Paychecks, 401(k)s and Bet on Themselves.

Police responded around 1:30 p.m. on Dec. 13 to a shopping center in Mandeville after reports of an assault involving two people, according to the Mandeville Police Department. A man, who has been identified as Richard Suarez, is is seen on video posted to YouTube approaching a silver truck and swearing at the woman inside to move it. Suarez then uses profane language on bystanders who told him to leave the woman alone before confronting another driver. “Cool, I can get violent with you because you’re a guy,” Suarez is heard on video telling the driver. The two were arguing about the parking dispute before Suarez punched the man to the ground, the video shows. Suarez fled the area before officers arrived to take the driver, who was not identified, to a local hospital to be treated for his injuries, Mandeville police said. His condition is unknown at this time. Suarez was found at a Veterans Affairs hospital and booked into St. Tammany Parish Jail on Dec. 13, according to police and media outlets.

12/16/2021,"Donald Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has a new book out and it’s ruffling a few feathers in the former administration. The Chief’s Chief, published Dec. 7, shares insider information about the June 2020 racial justice protests and that infamous Bible photo with the former president in front of St. John’s Church in Washington, D.C. The glare of the spotlight is on daughter Ivanka Trump and how she reportedly came up with the PR stunt that went awry. Meadows writes that Ivanka wanted to get support from the “people of faith” who followed the Trump administration because everyone in the White House grew concerned about the growing crowds around the historic building, per an excerpt from Religious News Service, via The Washington Post. With some damage already done to the structure, including a smashed window and a small fire in the basement, they decided to take action. More from SheKnows See Donald Trump & More of the Trump Family in This Photo Album AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File. Click here to read the full article. According to Meadows, Ivanka formulated a plan and suggested her father “give his address in the Rose Garden as planned, and then lead a group of his closest aides and advisors over to St. John’s Church, where he would deliver a short message to the American people.” Her objective, on paper, seemed to be an ideal way to handle the situation — it would symbolize that “law and order would prevail” and align Trump voters by sending “a message to people of faith.” Meadows revealed that Donald “loved the idea” as he often listened to his daughter’s advice and staffers ran around the White House to find the perfect Bible for Donald to hold. (He picked one not based on its looks, but for “the way it felt in his hands.”) Buy: ‘The Chief’s Chief’ $25.20 With the Bible tucked in Ivanka’s purse, the group walked over to Lafayette Square after clergy and the protestors had been cleared out by tear gas, clubs, pepper spray, and riot shields, per a U.S. Department of Interior report on the incident. Although the photo-op was supposed to take place in the church after Donald said a prayer, the group reassembled outside the building once they realized St. John’s was boarded up for safety. And that’s when the Ivanka-generated moment occurred — Donald, looking stoic, posed for photographers while holding up the Bible in front of the church. For Meadows, he was “never prouder to be serving under President Trump” while many in religious circles criticized Donald for using the Bible for publicity. Some may see Ivanka’s moment as a failure, others as a success — but it will always be one of the most indelible moments in her father’s presidency.

12/16/2021,"On Friday, the prosecution rested in its sex-trafficking and conspiracy case against Ghislaine Maxwell, who stands accused of helping the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein procure underage girls to abuse. They called 24 witnesses, including former private pilots and household employees of Epstein’s, a psychologist to speak as an expert witness on childhood sexual abuse, and four accusers. Through testimony — bolstered by birth certificates, flight logs, photographs and floor plans of Epstein’s various planes and properties, and other evidence — the prosecution laid out the argument they’d set up in opening statements: That Maxwell was Epstein’s “second in command” and that she’d “[set] young girls up to be molested by a predator.” More from Rolling Stone Prosecution Saved Strongest Testimony for Last in Ghislaine Maxwell Trial Final Accuser's Testimony in Ghislaine Maxwell Trial Delayed By Lawyer Illness Epstein Pilot's Private Flight Log Confirms Accusers, Famous Friends Flew With Ghislaine Maxwell Prosecutors have not needed to show that Maxwell abused the girls, only that she helped Epstein secure girls, for illegal sexual activity for the conspiracy counts, and that she helped “entice, recruit, and transport” minors for the purpose of illegal sexual activities for the trafficking counts. Incidentally, however, multiple women described Maxwell having touched their breasts. Maxwell, 59, has denied all charges, and could spend the rest of her life in prison if she’s convicted. The defense has cross-examined most of the government’s witnesses, devoting the majority of their time to working on discrediting the women who accuse Maxwell of aiding in their abuse by Epstein. Along the way, a narrative has emerged among some observers that the prosecution’s case isn’t as strong as it should be. Not everyone agrees. Attorney Lisa Bloom, an admittedly embattled figure in the world of sex crimes litigation, has worked on both sides of cases like this. She has represented eight Epstein accusers, and also, it was revealed in 2017, advised disgraced movie mogul and MeToo supervillain Harvey Weinstein, who is serving a 23-year prison sentence for a rape and sexual assault, on how to launder his reputation. She has been following the trial in person and remotely and thinks the state is coming out on top so far. “The prosecution did a very good job,” Bloom says. “They chose four accusers who were credible….They, I assume, had a lot of accusers to choose from and they chose these four.” I have been observing the trial most days from the overflow courtrooms for Rolling Stone and came away with a similar impression. It seems that while the defense is doing its duty of attempting to pick apart testimonies based on minor inconsistencies, the big-picture stories told by the women — that Epstein abused them and Maxwell helped him, by, for example, showing them how he liked to be touched — are what will probably stick in the minds of jurors. Here are four takeaways from the prosecution’s case. Epstein was the chief abuser — but according to witnesses, Maxwell helped Because Epstein died by suicide before his own verdict could be decided, and since Maxwell’s lawyers have so far taken the stance that perhaps no abuse occurred at all, the government is in the position of trying to prove two people’s wrongdoings. After all, Maxwell’s alleged crimes can’t exist without Epstein’s.  Sometimes the caliber of Epstein’s crimes can feel overwhelming by comparison, and Maxwell’s defense has repeatedly suggested their client is a scapegoat for Epstein. But the fact is her alleged actions are inextricable from his, so credibly presenting the details of Epstein’s abuse is an essential part of the case. “The jury will be suspicious if they leave something out, so they have to tell about what Epstein did,” Bloom says. “But they also have to tie it to Ghislaine every time.” Through testimony from former employees about Maxwell managing Epstein’s properties and planes, and from women claiming she instructed them on how to touch Epstein when they were minors, the government has kept Maxwell in the picture at every turn. Shipping addresses didn’t prove Maxwell sent gifts, but backed accusers’ testimony  The government hoped to use shipping receipts to back up witnesses’ claims. Last Thursday, for instance, the government spent several minutes going through FedEx invoices of packages Epstein sent to Carolyn, who had testified two days earlier about receiving lingerie from Epstein and Maxwell. They pointed to packages sent from Epstein’s New York City office to Carolyn’s address in West Palm Beach. On cross-examination, the defense pointed out that Maxwell’s name was not on the return address of packages sent to Carolyn — it had been mostly Epstein, and once included assistant Sarah Kellen. Other entries on the same invoice papers showed Maxwell sent packages to other people, but never to Carolyn.  The intended impact was to sever Maxwell from Epstein, but what it really did was show her busily shipping packages from a shared FedEx account. And as Bloom points out, Epstein’s former Palm Beach house manager, Juan Alessi — as well as two pilots — testified that Maxwell would have outranked other staff, including an assistant like Kellen, and could have directed her to send a package. The exchange lent credibility to Carolyn’s claims that she’d received lingerie after falling into Epstein’s ring of abuse, which testimony suggested included Maxwell as a top-ranking member. “Her name is not going to be on each piece of evidence. I don’t find that particularly significant,” Bloom says. “I think overall, there’s been enough tied to her that the jury can come back with a guilty verdict.”  The prosecution wants the jury to look at the aggregate total of the evidence, Bloom says: Four accusers who say Maxwell was involved in their recruitment and abuse. And bolstering Carolyn’s claim that she received lingerie from Epstein by FedEx as a 14-year-old adds to her credibility as a witness. Maxwell’s name missing from the return address doesn’t let Maxwell off the hook. After all, Carolyn also claimed Maxwell had been the person who asked her for her address. Witnesses consistently linked Maxwell closely to Epstein  The testimonies of each alleged victim were the prosecution’s strongest way of tying Maxwell to Epstein. In the stories each woman told, Maxwell was never excluded from the scene. The defense has pointed to inconsistencies in prior interviews and paperwork where some accusers left Maxwell out of their retellings at the time. But the testimony the accusers gave at the trial painted pictures that linger, and Maxwell is in them all. Sometimes, she’s a supporting character, lurking nearby Epstein and a young girl to apparently make the child feel more trusting. Other times she’s an active participant, the witnesses say, coaching a girl on how to rub Epstein’s feet, or worse. Witnesses who worked closely with Maxwell under Epstein’s employ also emphasized the close ties between him and Maxwell. Alessi and pilots Larry Visoski and David Rodgers all referred to her as Epstein’s second in command and described oftentimes taking instructions from her rather than Epstein himself or anyone else below him. “I understood she was the lady of the house,” Alessi said, and claimed Maxwell gave him a booklet of rules for how the house should be maintained. Annie Farmer helped the state finish on a high note  Ending with Epstein accuser Annie Farmer was one of the strongest choices the prosecution made. While Bloom, who referred to Farmer as a “badass,” emphasized that there is no perfect witness, especially to childhood sexual abuse, Farmer came close. She was willing to testify under her full name; she had repeated her story mostly consistently in prior interviews; she had kept a diary from the time of her allegations; she came armed with a PhD, which, even it shouldn’t, probably increased her credibility in front of a jury; and she was lucky enough to have a strong and enduring social support system: her mother and her high school boyfriend both came to testify, as well. “I thought calling her last was really a stroke of genius,” Bloom says. “Even though her allegations were milder than those of the other accusers, she has a lot of corroboration to her story. She reported him to the police in 1996. She told her boyfriend and her mother contemporaneously. I always want backup witnesses like that in my cases, and she had that.”  The defense’s job is to pick apart the government’s case point by point. They have already taken jabs at accusers’ credibility and questioned the accuracy of their memories. The defense is doing its job by attempting to introduce doubt using small pieces of inconsistency to create a broad impression of untruthfulness. it’s impossible to know at this point whether this will prove successful in the eyes of the jury. The prosecution will ask the panel to look at the totality of the evidence they’ve presented, namely through four strong accusers who painted sinister pictures of Maxwell’s involvement in Epstein’s twisted world. It’s a visceral rendering the jury likely won’t be able to dismiss.
