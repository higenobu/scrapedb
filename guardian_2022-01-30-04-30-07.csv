1/30/2022,"I am sitting at my desk in a Covid-secured Observer newsroom trying to achieve a feat that may be beyond my journalistic skill: to make you care about the vile state of our prisons. A generation ago, liberal newspapers and the BBC competed to break stories about the degradation inflicted in the public’s name. Now the web has given editors too much information. In the 20th century, they could kid themselves that readers cared. But the click-counters don’t lie and the 21st century has shown that, although readers say they care, as a matter of observable fact they don’t. Prison reform has all but vanished from public debate.  How to break the indifference? Let’s try a statistic. A punch to the gut with a killer fact. Last week, the Ministry of Justice revealed the number of jail suicides was up by 28%. When Covid hit, it ordered most of its 80,000 inmates to stay in their cells for 23 hours a day. Near perpetual confinement slowed the spread of the virus and cut assaults on prisoners and prison officers, which is why ministers are thinking of keeping lockdown going after Covid has gone. But it has been a mental health disaster. The authorities don’t keep decent records because they know that the public doesn’t care. The Commons justice committee said the best guess it could make was that 70% of inmates have two or more mental health conditions. Locking them in cells for 23 hours a day, week after week, month after month, has pushed many to the edge and over it. The stats not doing it for you? How about a bit of human life or, rather, a needless death? My editors always told me to grab the readers with a case study and save the boring stuff for later. Prison officers found Charlie Todd hanging in a segregation unit at Durham Prison. Once they might have been saved his life. But as well as defunding the police, the Conservatives have defunded the prison service. Four staff were meant to have been on duty at the unit, but weren’t. Officers said budget cuts meant “on a day to day basis, no one [was] in charge”. Charlie was awaiting trial for burglary and a more serious wounding charge. Prosecutors later dropped the wounding allegation against his associates, so the odds were they wouldn’t have charged him and he would not even have received a custodial sentence. His mother, Emma, described “a handsome, loving boy who loved to tell a story and would put a smile on the face of anyone who met him. He was a cheeky chappie, happy go lucky and loyal.” Her son was just 18. The prisons are stuffed with inmates like him on remand or serving pointless and dangerous short sentences. There’s no time to offer them treatment or rehabilitation. The state holds on to them just long enough to lose them their jobs or the partner who might have persuaded them to go straight. Unsurprisingly, they go out and reoffend. Predictably, Boris Johnson is making a bad situation worse. As part of his despairing efforts to save his worthless backside, the prime minister is inventing policies that might deter Tory MPs from chucking him into history’s dustbin. To prove he’s a tough guy, he announced he would increase the power of magistrates to jail defendants without any of that old-fashioned nonsense about the right to trial by jury. Soon, there will be yet more people sent to prison for short terms. In they will go, out they will come, and back in they will go again. Still not with me? We are talking about criminals, after all. I accept it’s one thing to lament that we send the most vulnerable to the places we care about least. But prisoners are not the same as autistic kids abused in mental health wards or innocent refugees imprisoned in detention centres. For all that, even when you’ve acknowledged there are inmates who should never be let out, you are still left with tens of thousands of ill and addicted people with trivial criminal records. Rory Stewart told me that nothing he had seen in Afghanistan or Iraq was “so screwed” as the system he encountered when he became prisons minister in 2018. “Violence had tripled to 30,000 assaults a year, every institution was overcrowded, filthy and rat and drug-infested.” In the poor world, prisons were relatively open. Inmates could leave cells. Their families could bring food. Here, he found only neglect. Stewart and his then boss, David Gauke, tried to limit the abuse. Johnson has a reverse Midas touch, however: everything he touches turns to dirt. He drove them out of parliament for opposing his extreme version of EU withdrawal and prison reform became just another opportunity to build a better country Brexit destroyed. The prison service remains Whitehall’s equivalent of a posting to Siberia – an assignment the ambitious and talented run from. When the job of chief executive came up, officials tried to change that. They approached Nils Öberg from the Swedish ministry of justice, which had cut prison numbers and reduced crime. They asked what he would do if ministers and the courts sent him an extra 10,000 prisoners. He replied that he would refuse to cram them into overcrowded jails. The negotiations stopped and you can see why. It’s all very well for Scandinavia to insist on civilised standards but the Brits would never accept them. Can you imagine the rage in the media if the jails closed their doors just because they were full? They gave the job to one Jo Farrar. Instead of having experience of working in the criminal justice system, she had run Bath and North East Somerset council. She’s presided over a humanitarian scandal, but at least she hasn’t provoked angry headlines in the tabloids. If you still don’t care, reflect that bad government kills and maims the law-abiding as well as the convicted. Everyone knows that to reduce crime and the suffering it brings to the innocent, you must boost mental health and drug and alcohol treatment services, tackle homelessness and give teenagers after-school sport clubs and summer jobs to absorb their energy. This government hasn’t done it and will never do it and if you are unlucky perhaps one day you will pay the price for its carelessness.

1/30/2022,"Without a doubt, Besart Berisha will go down as an A-Leagues legend. Last week, just over six months on from departing Australia in pursuit of one final European run, the ALM’s all-time leading goalscorer announced his retirement, ending a journey that started at Tennis Borussia Berlin and ended at FC Prishtina, having along the way become intrinsically tied to Australian football. As befitting his time on these shores, tributes for Berisha were quick to flow, celebrating the 36-year-old as one of the greatest ALM players of all time thanks to his exploits at Brisbane Roar, Melbourne Victory and Western United.  Yet, especially when contrasted with the reaction to another ALM milestone set this weekend, Berisha’s retirement does raise the question of how A-Leagues’ greatness can be measured. Though undoubtedly in its upper tier, Berisha is probably not the most talented forward in ALM history. Ola Toivonen, Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler have also had time in the competition while Alessandro Del Piero spent some games up top for Sydney FC. David Villa played four games for Melbourne City in 2014–15 and at some point, Perth Glory will be hoping that they actually get a chance to start Daniel Sturridge. But talent does not equal greatness. And while Berisha’s resume comes nowhere close to that of Heskey or Villa in a global context, his legacy in ALM – whose story cannot be told without him – is what makes him stand out. A player possessing both talent and success in equal measure makes identification of greatness relatively simple. Berisha, Thomas Broich, and Miloš Ninković – the “big three” in the ALM pantheon – will all be remembered not just for their ability to impact games of football as individuals, but also for the trophies and success that seemed to follow them wherever they went. But beyond that, things get a little more nebulous. Despite spending only two seasons in what was a middling Sydney team, does Del Piero rank as an ALM great? Certainly, the talent is there to justify it and moments such as his debut against Newcastle Jets are established league lore, but is that enough? Do off-field factors such as the surge of excitement around his signing, the mainstream press that followed and the heady heights the league was experiencing at that time confer it? And then there are other, even murkier cases. This weekend, Nikolai Topor-Stanley became just the second player to reach 350 ALM games with remarkably little fanfare and, when he retires, he will likely have supplanted Andrew Durante as the all-time appearances leader. Held in high regard for his professionalism, the 36-year-old was also a part of the Wanderers side that won an ALM premiership in their first year and became champions of Asia in 2014. But is Topor-Stanley – his legacy largely built on historic consistency and longevity – an ALM great? Is Durante, for that matter? What of Leigh Broxham? The finest embodiment of a one-club player in league history thanks to his 342 league games with Victory, his trophy cabinet is bulging with team accolades. He and Kevin Muscat are the only players to have won back-to-back Victory medals. Despite never having been the most talented or important player in his team, is his intrinsic connection to the competition’s history and what he has come to mean to Victory fans a claim to ALM greatness? Or just Victory greatness? In an ALW context, the concept has often become intertwined with the exploits of the Matildas’ “golden generation” and the transformative effect that players have had on the game; the likes of Lisa De Vanna, Sam Kerr, Michelle Heyman and Clare Polkinghorne, who have dragged the competition to higher standards and ambitions. Other arguments come for figures like Kate Gill, Sarah Walsh, Sally Shipard, and Heather Garriock – foundational players who continue to contribute as coaches and administrators. Or for players such as Jess Fishlock, international arrivals who dominated the competition before leaving with numerous trophies. Yet there are others. Teresa Polias’s brand, for example, is almost exclusively tied to Sydney FC rather than the national team, but as the league’s appearances record holder and heart and soul of its most successful club, it would be a brave individual that argues against her being ALW great. What about someone like Gema Simon, who has played 138 ALW games – a feat magnified by its relatively short length – but has done so while playing for the perennially trophy-less Newcastle Jets? Club great or league great? Inevitably, it’s a fierce debate. For greatness to mean anything, it has to be an exclusive club. But where the line is drawn, and why, will likely be in the eye of the beholder.",Sport/Football,A footballer’s talent alone is not enough to be considered an ALM great | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/a-footballers-talent-alone-is-not-enough-to-be-considered-an-alm-great
1/30/2022,"It would be easy to look at the vivid array of colour contained in the paintings of artist Concetta Antico and assume she is using artistic licence. The trunks of her eucalyptus trees are hued with violet and mauve; the yellow crest on her cockatoo has hints of green and blue; the hypercolour of a garden landscape looks almost psychedelic. “It’s not just an affectation and it’s not artistic licence,” says Antico. “I’m actually painting exactly what I see. If it’s a pink flower and then all of a sudden you see a bit of lilac or blue, I actually saw that.”  Antico is a tetrachromat, which means she has a fourth colour receptor in her retina compared with the standard three which most people have. While those of us with three of these receptors – called cone cells – have the ability to distinguish around one million different colours, tetrachromats see an estimated 100 million. Until 10 years ago, Antico says, “I didn’t know I was not experiencing the world like other people were. For me, the world was just really very colourful. It’s kind of like, you don’t know you’re a zebra unless you’re not a zebra.” As a child growing up in Sydney, Antico says she was always “a little bit out of the box” – dying her hair with bright colours and choosing emerald-green carpet and black and lime green curtains for her bedroom. Fascinated with nature, she’d often disappear for an entire day into the land around a nearby golf course. “I always felt like I was living in a very magical world. I know children say that, but for me, it was like everything was hyper-wonderful, hyper-different. I was always exploring into nature, delving and trying to see the intricacies, because I’d see so much more detail in everything. Someone else might look at a leaf or a petal on a flower, but for me, it was like a compulsion to really understand it, really see it, and sometimes spend a lot of time on it. And I just wanted to paint and portray everything that I was seeing.” After finishing university, Antico moved to the United States, where she became an artist and art teacher in San Diego, developing her unique style of colourful landscapes and flora and fauna. Her diagnosis didn’t come until 2012, when one of her students, a neurologist, emailed her a scientific paper about tetrachromacy, speculating that this could be what Antico had. A few months earlier, Antico had discovered her daughter was colour-blind (“I told her she was fine, she was just different and special and amazing and I’d teach her how to see colour anyway”) and when she opened the article one of the first things she read was that women who have potential for tetrachromacy also have potential to create a colour-blind female offspring. Antico emailed the scientists who wrote the paper and “within 24 hours, I was sending my saliva up to Washington” where testing confirmed she had the genetic mutation responsible for tetrachromacy. According to Dr Kimberly Jameson, a University of California scientist who has studied Antico, just having the gene – which around 15% of women have – is not alone sufficient to be a tetrachromat, but it’s a necessary condition. “In Concetta’s case … one thing we believe is that because she’s been painting sort of continuously since the age of seven years old, she has really enlisted this extra potential and used it. This is how genetics works: it gives you the potential to do things and if the environment demands that you do that thing, then the genes kick in.” Discovering she saw the world differently to others changed the way Antico taught her students. “I became a lot more patient,” she says. “Say we were down painting a beach, I’d do a lot more of, ‘OK, let’s look at this together. Can you see that?’ And if they’d say no, I’d be like, ‘Well, let’s look a little closer’ … When they see it, they will paint it, so my students’ paintings became much richer.” Through family genetic testing, Antico learned that her mother, who died when she was 12, was also likely to be a tetrachromat – a discovery that helped Antico make sense of her childhood home. “Like, she had a red and blue light in the swimming pool in the 60s, just to make it violet. Stuff that nobody was doing, really bizarre stuff, and her house was unusual colours.” Having super vision, Antico says, brings her enormous happiness. “I’m so anti-drugs, and I’m sure people just think I’m high on something all the time, but I’m really just high on life and the beauty that’s around us. I often think to myself, how could you be unhappy in this world? Just go sit in a park. Just go look at a bush or a tree. You can’t not appreciate how magnificent it is.” While the natural world is a positive stimulant for Antico, many man-made environments, such as a large shopping centre with fluorescent lighting, have the opposite effect. “I feel very uneasy. I actually avoid going into those kinds of buildings unless I absolutely have to,” she says. “I don’t enjoy the barrage, the massive onslaught of bits of unattractive colour. I mean, there’s a difference between looking at a row of stuff in a grocery store and looking at a row of trees. It’s like, it’s ugly, and the lights are garish. It makes me not happy.” Now settled in Byron Bay, Antico is teaching less and painting more, wanting to produce “even more work than I did before, in these final decades of my life”. “I’m going to keep painting my birds, my animals, my trees. I want to describe what I’m seeing in nature because that’s a window, in a way, to things that other people aren’t really seeing.”",News/Society,‘I’m really just high on life and beauty’: the woman who can see 100 million colours,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/30/im-really-just-high-on-life-and-beauty-the-woman-who-can-see-100-million-colours
1/30/2022,"I hate meditation. Well, I used to hate it. As someone who can barely sit still, the thought of sitting there doing absolutely nothing, thinking about nothing – well, that sounds like torture. Usually, when people say meditation, they are referring to sitting meditation. Where you sit with your legs crossed, focus on your breathing and empty your mind.  Growing up around Buddhist temples, meditation always seemed like a bit of a punishment to me. Time out. But as I got older and started listening to the nuns that watched me grow up, I learned that meditation is so much more than doing nothing. “Meditation is hard work,” says Venerable Dr Juewei, a Buddhist nun at the Nan Tien Temple in Wollongong, but she believes her 20 years of experience in meditation have helped her keep “calm in spite of disappointments, and steady in executing [her] tasks”. But in our busy lives, between work or class, raising kids or maintaining a social life, how can we find time to stay mindful, aware and calm? When I was a Buddhist scripture teacher, I always began and ended my classes with a minute of pause to “check in” and “check out”, which helped students reset their minds for the next activity. Juewei says this helps people “transit from one activity to the next” and “pausing allows us to wrap up the previous activity and recalibrate for the new one”. The process is very straightforward. You can choose how long you want to do it for, though I recommend around two to five minutes. All you need to do is find a safe and comfortable space, sit with your feet grounded and flat and breathe slowly. Your eyes can be open or closed. Once you’re in position, bring your attention to all the sensations of your body. Are you sore? Does your head feel heavy? Then bring your attention to the events that have brought you to this moment. How do they make you feel? Throughout this process of observation. Don’t linger on any one sensation or thought, you are just making note of them and moving on. If stillness isn’t for you, you can meditate while eating, writing, gardening or drawing. The key, however, is concentration. When you give something the awareness and concentration to realise its causes and effects, that is meditation. Juewei’s favourite form of meditation is sky meditation. “When I look into the sky, it reminds me of boundless creativity and possibilities, so that I do not get too attached to any circumstance, and that we are all connected under the same sky. Clouds changing shape and location teaches me impermanence.” She says it’s also “great for my eyes which are often tired from computer overuse”, and most of us can relate to that.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: ‘If stillness isn’t for you, you can meditate while eating’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/30/easy-wins-if-stillness-isnt-for-you-you-can-meditate-while-eating
1/30/2022,"Balgo is Country for all of us now. We were all born here, these generations here today. We are Wirrimanu kids. We belong to Balgo. That’s what we paint. That’s why we paint. This is our story.”– Warlayirti artist Eva Nagomarra John Carty opened his email and downloaded the images. They were photos of paintings, found in a shipping container somewhere in the Kimberley. They were muddy and water damaged, but recognisable.  Carty admits he cried on that day in 2019. He had been looking for those paintings for 20 years. The story of how the Balgo paintings were found is vague, as is the story of how they were lost. A guy (unnamed) started unpacking a container he’d had for a while, to see what damage recent flooding had done. There were paintings inside. He called a couple of mates, people who knew something about art, to take a look at them. Those mates had a glimmer of recognition. Then there was a phone call to the authorities, and an email with pictures of the paintings was sent to the city, to Carty, the Balgo expert. It was the lost Balgo exhibition. The paintings representing what would become one of Australian art’s most important movements had been stored in the early 80s, with the intention of putting them on display for the first time. But opportunities for relatively unknown artists were scarce. The art got packed away, forgotten in a corner of the Kimberley – until about 40 years later, when it emerged, muddy and mouldy, but intact. Balgo (Wirrimanu) is a remote Aboriginal community on the edge of the Great Sandy Desert in Western Australia. Population: about 400. The art movement born in Balgo has rippled across Australia, so even if you haven’t seen Balgo art, you’ve probably seen its influence. Carty is now head of humanities at the South Australian Museum. But at the turn of the century he was trying to work out what to do his PhD on. He was studying anthropology at the University of Melbourne, but on his way to Canberra he picked up an in-flight magazine. “I was just looking at these unbelievable paintings … these paintings from Balgo that just had this incredible presence. It was a moment of revelation, some kind of shift in my thinking about Australia, and I really wanted to go there and understand those artists,” he says. So he wrote to the Balgo artists, and asked if he could volunteer at the art centre. He ended up staying for three years in the tiny community. He has a photo from Balgo. It was taken in 1982, a couple of decades before he got there. A couple of camp dogs look on as men sit among the spinifex, painting for that first, fated exhibition of Balgo art. The faded colours of the photo belie the vibrancy of the desert ground, and the paintings themselves, propped up in the sunshine. These are the 1982 paintings that went missing, and the photo is how Carty knew what he was looking at when he saw them again in 2019. In between lies the story of the Balgo artists. In his book Balgo: Creating Country, Carty relays how the first Catholic missionaries came to the area and asked what the place was called. “[Community elder] George Lee Tjungurrayi said: ‘The old people thought they were pointing at the grass! That grass was called parlku. So they said to Father, parlku. And Father went and called the place Balgo.’” In the 1960s, the mission was moved to a more hospitable spot nearby, but kept the name. In the late 1970s, following their families who lived at Papunya, Balgo people became interested in painting. In the mid-1980s, the Warlayirti Artists Aboriginal Corporation was founded, and the movement’s influence grew. Warlayirti artist Eva Nagomarra says people came from all around to paint at Balgo. “In the early days we did painting. Cultural way. For ourselves ... we did a lot of landscapes at the start. Then after that people did a lot of paintings for the church. Then we decided we gotta do our own painting now. About ngurra and tjukurrpa. Ngurra are the places we came from, our Country. We came to the mission from Kiwirrkurra, from Canning Stock Route, from Mulan Lake Country. All the different families. All now to this Country we call Balgo. “And we have always enjoyed our culture. We never stopped. Always dancing and singing, teaching our kids and keeping our culture strong. Here in Balgo. We keep our ceremonies, we visit our Country. That’s why we still live here. That’s why we paint. That story from our Tjamu and Tjatja [grandfather and grandmother]. Our rockholes and waters where we used to live. We paint that. Our bush tucker and lovely bush potatoes! We paint that. Balgo is Country for all of us now.” But when Carty arrived, he knew there were pages missing from the Balgo origin story. “The story was always unsatisfying, vague,” Carty says. “And that photo … we knew those paintings were out there somewhere.” Had they been thrown out? Picked up on the cheap? Tucked away somewhere? “They weren’t in public collections … I searched for them, and I never gave up hope, I felt like they were out there somewhere,” he says. “But it felt like those early pages of the Balgo story had been kind of ripped out and [there was] this vague mythology of how the painting started.” The Balgo artists went on, creating ever more vivid and colourful works, building on the famous movement. Carty went on to work in museums. And then the shipping container turned up. “I clicked on these thumbnails in my inbox, and the images came up, and they were the images of those paintings that were in the spinifex surrounded by the men. I knew all of them. They were all burned into my mind because I’d been hoping to find them one day, and so I just had to cross-reference that photo,” he says. “They’d been in this time warp, this shipping container for 40 years. In a black hole. Then they’ve been spat back out by the universe.” The works were smeared with mud, mouldy shadows across the dots and curved lines, the stories the paintings tell. Carty gathered them up, wrapped them “in his socks and jocks”, he says, and brought them to the SA Museum. Cultural conservators from Artlab Australia went to work, doing their best to restore the artworks. There was one of the paintings Sunfly Tjampitjin had done in 1982, a curl of dark around the bottom. Gary Njamme’s work of bright clear colours, just clouded down one side. Alan Winderoo’s work, with just a hint of a vague shadow. “They did a really beautiful and extraordinary thing in restoring those paintings, as close as can be to the original state,” Carty says. And while he thinks origin stories are important, he says there’s a danger in fetishising the past. So he went back to Balgo, to the children and grandchildren of the original artists, and asked if they wanted to paint in response to those first paintings. In the exhibition Balgo Beginnings, the found paintings hang alongside the new. Pauline Sunfly hangs alongside her famous father Sunfly Tjamptitjin; Jimmy Tchooga alongside his grandfather Alan Winderoo. Carty’s book traces the evolution of the art as the people are buffeted by colonisation, the cattlemen, the missionaries and the political, cultural and economic upheaval they brought. And it has all those missing pages, back where they belong. “[People] don’t know that story, they only know the new paintings. Our beginnings got lost,” senior Balgo artist Jimmy Tchooga says. “Now everyone can see where the Balgo story started. “I was happy to see my tjamu [grandfather] Winderoo’s first painting. I know that place, but never seen painting like that. So it gave me [the] idea to paint. I painted a new way, old way, but new again.”  Balgo Beginnings is at the South Australian Museum until 6 February",Arts/Art and design,‘Beginnings got lost’: fabled Aboriginal art on show 40 years after disappearance,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/30/beginnings-got-lost-fabled-aboriginal-art-on-show-40-years-after-disappearance
1/30/2022,"At least 60% of Australians eligible for a Covid booster have received one, according to new government data. However, an analysis of government figures by Guardian Australia shows the booster rate could be as low as 50% once new, expanded eligibility criteria are taken into account. And, despite new record highs in daily vaccinations, the rollout is still lagging at least a month behind the “ideal” schedule. This is likely due to the continued expansion of eligibility criteria by federal and state governments.  Here is everything we know about the progress of the booster vaccination rollout. Data from the health department, released in response to questions from Guardian Australia, shows 60% of eligible Australians aged 18 and over have received a booster, with the rate rising for those in older age groups: The government has not been publishing booster numbers by age in its regular vaccination updates. Tracking the rollout of boosters in the older population is important as older people are more likely to die, or require treatment in an intensive care unit than younger people. Questions have also been raised as to whether the booster rollout in aged care has been fast enough, with a large number of age care homes reporting fresh Covid outbreaks in the past week. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For their estimate, the federal government considered anyone over 18 who had received a second dose at least four months ago to be eligible for a booster. But last week New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and the ACT cut the gap to three months, making millions more eligible overnight. With the newer three month eligibility criteria in some states, Guardian Australia estimates that closer to 50% of the eligible population have had a booster shot so far. The latest was the third change to booster eligibility, after the gap was reduced to five months at the beginning of December and again to four months from the beginning of January. The gap was set to drop again to three months from 31 January. The drop to five months eligibility at the beginning of December and again in January led to significant increases in the number of boosters being administered. This is likely due to how many only got their second doses in the second half of 2021. But the record numbers of vaccinations per day hasn’t been enough to close the gap between eligible and administered doses. Another measure of rollout progress is the actual delay between when the equivalent number of booster and second doses were administered. Despite the official three and four month gaps for booster eligibility, Australia has only administered as many boosters as it had second doses five months ago. The gap has been closing over time – down from six months in December. But at the current rate Australia won’t hit 80 or 90% booster coverage until the second half of the year. Israel and seven other countries have already given booster doses to more than 70% of those who have received two doses. Australia has given boosters to just over 30% of those who have received a second dose. Several countries experiencing large outbreaks last year already reduced the dosing gap to three months. But experts then told Guardian Australia that this wasn’t necessarily advisable, as there is a tradeoff between longer lasting protection and a quick antibody hit. “We do know from evidence from the first two doses that a longer interval between the first dose and second dose gives you higher antibodies, higher protection,” says Cyra Patel, a PhD candidate at the Australian National University. Australia has since reduced the dosing interval several times, but it has yet to expand booster eligibility to those under 18 years old. Israel started administering the booster to 12-year-olds in August last year. The US expanded eligibility to 12 to 17-year-olds in early January. More than half of all second doses were administered in the final four months of 2021, so many Australians are only newly eligible for boosters. But vaccine rollout was also expanded to the five to 11 age group in early December and 12-15 years in August. This means that those looking for boosters are competing for vaccine slots with children who are newly eligible and trying to get their second or even first dose of a Covid vaccine. Ken Tsang, who created a website to help find vaccine slots says there was a significant increase in traffic when the booster interval was first dropped to five months in December. “This was pretty sustained throughout the Christmas and New Year period with fewer bookings being available due to the holiday period and demand for the five to 11 year group. This demand has come down a fair bit in recent weeks.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Getting data on booster availability can be tricky due to the myriad systems, private and public for booking vaccines. Ken Tsang provided Guardian Australia with more than a month of availability data from his vaccine clinic finder. It contains thousands of individual clinics from across the country, but is not comprehensive. “Some clinics, especially state or territory-run clinics, require invitations, registration, logins and email verifications to access the booking system and see the booking slots. These are particularly challenging to get accurate and reliable availability information for,” Tsang says. Analysis of the data shows a jump in early December in clinics that have no availability within the next week right after booster eligibility was expanded and five to 11-year-olds given provision approval. Since then the number of clinics with no availability for the next week has remained steady at around 80%. The booster rate has increased and states have launched more walk-in centres, pop-up clinics and even vaccination programs at home. But the stability of vaccine slot availability suggests we may be at capacity for the clinics that Ken Tsang is tracking.

1/30/2022,"Stephanie Oatley recalls a day in late December when she needed to get a whole unit of young people experiencing homelessness tested for Covid. “We had a young person who started showing symptoms, and a second young person got an itchy throat,” says Oatley. “In the van they hopped. There was only one place open … They got there at 9am, and waited for nine hours.”  Oatley is the chief executive of Platform Youth Services, which provides crisis accommodation to people as young as 12 in Sydney’s west, Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury regions. Like most sectors of the east coast economy, homelessness services have been ravaged by Omicron leaving them without enough staff, forcing them to reduce services and to lock down their crisis accommodation. Some have been scrambling to find – and then fork out thousands of dollars on – rapid tests. “Services feel that they have been stranded,” says Katherine McKernan, the chief executive of Homelessness NSW. She notes the government had acted quickly to provide hotel accommodation for the homeless during previous outbreaks. But the Omicron response has been lacking. “The processes in place for the previous lockdown have not been able to be implemented due the high number of cases and the overwhelmed health system,” she says, “and none of the arrangements for hotel accommodation provided to rough sleepers has been reinstated this time around.” In Platform’s case the situation has been particularly complex. Those staying in its crisis accommodation are aged between 12-17. As a result, Oatley says Covid-positive clients couldn’t move to a health hotel. Due to severe staff shortages, some employees were essentially forced to move into the crisis units during outbreaks “just to get us through”. “The big thing is staff shortages,” says Oatley. “We’d have one staff member that would come down with Covid and then nine staff would get Covid from that one case. The clients would have Covid. We’re a small service of 45 staff, we’ve had 16 key staff get Covid.” “One of our houses has just been constant for three weeks,” she adds. Guardian Australia this week reported the findings of a Productivity Commission report that found that, pre-Omicron, nearly half of all people who seek help with homelessness in New South Wales were unable to get it. McKernan says the “unprecedented number of cases in services” meant some services have been forced to “make really difficult decisions around reducing intake, reducing the number of clients in accommodation in order to enable clients to isolate”. She notes it’s already “unfortunately already a hugely busy time for homelessness services”. In Melbourne, Launch Housing, which runs four crisis accommodation services across the city, has been forced to twice lock down its facilities due to an Omicron outbreak. “What that effectively means is that every time we have a Covid outbreak on site we don’t take new referrals,” says Andrew Hollows, a general manager at Launch Housing. In simple terms, an outbreak means for a short period some people who need crisis accommodation will not be able to receive it. These are, as McKernan says, “really difficult decisions”. Hollows says in these lockdown periods, Launch has been able to assist clients in other ways. “Even if they couldn’t go to crisis accommodation, they would still go to other accommodation options, or help them with financial assistance,” he says. “It wasn’t like we weren’t providing any response.” Peter Valpiani, chief executive of The Haymarket Foundation, which provides crisis accommodation and drug and alcohol services in Sydney, has done overnight shifts at its crisis accommodation as a result of the staff shortages. He says the Omicron crisis has flow-on effects for people the service assists. “We had a gentleman that was a close contact because he lived in the same house as somebody who tested positive, and he had just gotten a job,” says Valpiani. “You can imagine someone who is putting their life together, just returned to employment, and as a close contact you can’t work.” Valpiani says the man had tested positive via a rapid test and was therefore denied access to the Centrelink pandemic payment, which at the time required a PCR test result. “He was in this position where he needed the money in order to pay his rent, to not become homeless again,” he says, adding that Haymarket offered the man financial support. Then there has been the RAT race. McKernan says Homelessness NSW and the sector had first requested access to and use of RATs as a way of supporting clients in August 2021. The NSW government is now in the process of providing services with free access to rapid tests and has indicated it will reimburse them for past purchases. But the past month has been tough, even more so for clients. Another challenge is that, for some people experiencing homelessness, seven days of isolation can bring back trauma. “You’ve got people with, say, an incarceration history, so as soon as you say ‘hey, you’re locked up and you can’t leave’, that can cause sort of emotional triggers with people,” says Valpiani. “We have to do it in a really trauma-informed, sensitive way and look at ways in which we can provide bits of entertainment for people. Just to kind of get their mind off things, or to reduce anxiety.” Importantly, all homelessness services Guardian Australia spoke to say that while they have battled outbreaks in crisis accommodation, no clients have become seriously ill or required hospitalisation. But Oatley says several rounds of isolation due to cases in the services have been tough on the young people who rely on her organisation. “Young people don’t like being contained in a bedroom,” she says. “We were lucky we had access to … Netflix, Xboxes, and we got a big donation of really good art supplies.” Oatley acknowledges that Omicron was always bound to cause havoc. But she insists the chaos that was wrought on homelessness services could have been avoided. “I think the government was just really irresponsible when they opened everything back up without the resources,” says Oatley. “That’s the sort of stuff that I got a bit frustrated with. The government has made all these decisions but without the resources to implement them.” Asked if, things have improved after a horror month, Oatley replies: “No, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. “School’s coming back. Our staff is coming back to work. We’ve got RAT tests. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. So can our young people.”",News/Australia news,‘Stranded’: horror month for Australian homelessness services as Omicron ravages sector,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/stranded-horror-month-for-australian-homelessness-services-as-omicron-ravages-sector
1/30/2022,"Australian universities are hoping the return of international students and face-to-face learning will help the decimated sector “snap back” from Covid restrictions, but some teachers are warning the industry is in a perilous position. Since the pandemic, the number of international student visa holders has fallen by 205,854 – or 33.5% – with the sector losing at least $1.8bn in revenue in the first year alone, according to Universities Australia.  The flow-on effects have been massive. By last September, 20% of tertiary workers – approximately 40,000 – had lost their jobs, according to research from the Australia Institute. Across 2021, at least 2,100 courses were cut around the country, figures from the National Tertiary Education Union show. Alison Barnes, the president of the NTEU, said the number of lost courses could be much larger as there is no national database showing what is on offer. “It might be a drop in the ocean in regards to what’s been cut,” Barnes said. “None of this stuff is particularly transparent and that’s not a good thing. “When they closed the border, universities felt that impact very swiftly and very hard.” The sector is bracing for more cuts over the next two years after last year’s federal budget reduced funding for universities by nearly 10% over three years and the $1bn emergency research grant was discontinued. Barnes said this will not only impact the quality of education students receive but also Australia’s research capabilities. “Pulling resources from our institutions and universities, you can look at the impact now, but what worries me is what it means for society five years from now, 10 years from now,” she said. “It doesn’t end for universities. The problems created by Covid-19 and the federal government’s neglect of the sector will carry on for many years to come.” With the borders now open, universities are hoping the 131,000 international students who have been stuck overseas will return to complete their studies and Australia will resume its place as a world leader in tertiary education. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The full picture for enrolment and commencement numbers for both international and domestic students will not be known until March, but the minister for immigration, Alex Hawke, announced on 18 January that 43,300 international students had already returned to Australia. Peter Hurley, an education policy expert at Victoria University’s Mitchell Institute, said all eyes would be on the number of international students. “Are they coming back? That’s the question everyone wants to know, at what rate they come is really important. We’ll get the first indication in a month or two,” Hurley said. He said international students have been the cornerstone of Australia’s higher education policy for the last 30 years, used to supplement the sector’s income. “When it comes to international students, the reason people focus on them so much is they are so important to the university sector and the way it resources itself. “There’s no other way to fill the gap.” Hurley said the quality of education on offer at Australian universities had deteriorated during the pandemic, according to domestic students. This sentiment was echoed by one arts student from Victoria who said the inability to discuss and debate in groups had impacted their Masters degree. “It’s become a very individualised experience,” they said. Julie Kimber, a historian and union delegate at Swinburne University, likens working in academia right now to being at the Ford factory during the last days of car manufacturing in Australia. “I sometimes think we’re looking down the barrel,” she said. “If we’re going to online learning, what differentiates Australian unis from others around the world? “If I could do a course at the London School of Economics for the same or less money, I know where I would go.” She personally knows 12 people who have lost their jobs in the last year and said that while academics cared deeply about their students and research, morale was low across the workforce. “Universities are nothing like they were when it started. They’ve been corporatising for decades but we’re now reaching a stage where the sector bears little relationship to its purpose,” she said. In August last year a report produced by EY after interviewing senior industry figures predicted the number of international students in Australia would never return to its 2019 levels. Instead, it predicted a total revenue loss of $6bn by 2030. The shortfall could force the closure or merger of smaller institutions and would mean 50% of non-research staff would be out of work, the report said. EY’s global head of education, Catherine Friday, said the pandemic had “exposed the overreliance on on-campus learning and international students in Australia’s higher education system”. “There is so much financial strain in the sector right now and such uncertainty about ongoing income and revenue streams that it’s reasonable to suspect that there might be university closures or some sort of merger activity in the market,” she said. Not all of the sector agrees with this outlook. Catriona Jackson, the chief executive of Universities Australia, said Australian universities still offer a world-class experience and were ready to bounce back from the challenges. “Universities are preparing, with optimism, for a safe return to lively campus life, especially as we welcome back considerable numbers of local but also international students – many of whom have been waiting for up to two years to return,” she said. While it would take time, Australian universities offered a world-class experience – one that would continue to lure back students from overseas, she said. “We have reached a milestone with the reopening of our borders, but the sector will take time to recover. “We attract scholars from more than 140 countries,” Jackson said, “and the fundamental appeal of an Australian education remain as strong as ever: excellent universities, high vaccination rates and an enviable lifestyle.”",News/Australia news,‘Looking down the barrel’: Australian universities face nervous future post-Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/looking-down-the-barrel-australian-universities-face-nervous-future-post-covid
1/30/2022,"The Ulysses butterfly brings us to a halt. We are on the Atherton Tablelands, south-west of Cairns, to look for the rare and elusive Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroo, but the incandescent blue, sparking with each wing beat, is impossible to ignore. The butterfly dances along the rainforest edge, azure iridescence alternating with the dead-leaf dullness of the underwing. Then it flies up high, as if pulled on a string. One more flash and it is gone. We get back to our search.  The Wet Tropics region of Far North Queensland is home to two species of tree-kangaroo. All kangaroos and wallabies are descended from a climbing possum-like ancestor, but these far northern wonders of evolution have abandoned that ground-level hopping life and returned back to the canopy. Bennett’s tree-kangaroo lives in the lowland rainforests of the Daintree area, between Port Douglas and Cooktown. Finding it requires a long slog through dense scrub. Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroo lives on the Atherton Tablelands, where sightings are close to coffee and scones. We start at Curtain Fig national park, near the town of Yungaburra. The centrepiece of this pint-sized national park is a giant strangler fig thought to be about 500 years old. The dramatic curtains of roots are 15 metres tall and prop up a massive trunk, topped with branches draped in ferns and orchids. A flat boardwalk loops around the fig, protecting the forest from visitors, and the visitors from stinging trees, which grow wherever sunlight breaks through. The rainforest here is mabi forest, named after the Ngadjon word for tree-kangaroo. Once widespread on the Atherton Tablelands, much of the mabi forest was cleared by settlers. They took tall trees for timber and turned over the land to dairy herds. This endangered ecosystem is now restricted to patches and splinters in national parks and on private land. The tourist potential of the rainforest has long been recognised. In the 1920s, trains brought people on excursions from the sultry coast, and taxis and coaches carried sightseers up the winding roads from Cairns to the “jungles” of the Tablelands. A century later, the train line is now a walking track, and the vehicles have air-conditioning and comfortable suspension, but the patches of rainforest remain the same. Curtain Fig National Park is bustling with birds. Pied monarchs with impeccable black and white plumage and powder-blue rings around their eyes search tree trunks for insects. A brush-turkey rakes through leaf litter. Somewhere in the forest, a wompoo fruit-dove recites its name. We look up into the canopy. There are small movements – birds and butterflies – but nothing that looks like a tree-kangaroo. No commotion of shaking leaves. No long tail dangling like a rainforest vine. No rounded shape that appears both out of place and completely at home. This park is a good location for these unusual marsupials, but this morning they must be elsewhere. We head back to town for breakfast. There are other spots to try. Our next destination is a 15-minute drive from Yungaburra. We take the back roads past cattle paddocks and avocado orchards to the busy dairy town of Malanda with its vast two-storey wooden hotel and picture theatre that has been showing movies since 1929. At the edge of town, the North Johnstone River cuts through the rainforest and cascades down basalt steps into a swimming pool. Malanda Falls conservation park is another block of rainforest saved from clearing. Like Curtain Fig, it is a reliable place for tree-kangaroos. The visitors’ centre keeps a record of sightings. We follow the dirt track through the rainforest, checking for tell-tale claw marks on tree bark, looking up for tails and furry forms. The river is now far below, tumbling over rocks. Two whipbirds duet, the male’s whipcrack followed by the female’s tuneful whistle. A red-legged pademelon, a miniature rainforest kangaroo, bounds away. Its hind feet stamp out a warning. When Norwegian explorer Carl Lumholtz encountered a tree-kangaroo on his 1882 expedition to Queensland, he described it as “the most beautiful mammal” he had seen in Australia – so much better proportioned than the ungainly ground-dwelling kangaroos and wallabies. I’d argue the tiny pademelon whose solid backside and long, white-tipped tail just disappeared among the trees still manages to do all right for itself, despite its apparently dodgy dimensions. I do worry that it might be the only marsupial we see today, but that’s the way it is with nature. You see what you see. There are two more possibilities on my list: Nerada Tea Plantation at Glen Allyn, and Peterson Creek, back at Yungaburra, both are easily accessible by car, with well-made walking tracks. But as we stand in the carpark considering our next move, I glance across to the wall of trees. And there, just above the start of the rainforest track, is a commotion of shaking leaves. We get closer and see a long tail that is, indeed, dangling like a rainforest vine. Then a fuzzy face peers down, curious at the gawkers below. The dark eyes are contemplative and there is a calmness about this tree-dweller, even though the branch it sits on dips alarmingly under its weight. It is big and solid with warm grey fur on its back, and black on face, paws and hind feet. Still watching us, the tree-roo reaches back and scratches its side with massive claws. With its long feet, round ears and short muzzle, it looks like a cross between a wallaby and a sun-bear. It might not be the most beautiful mammal – who’s to judge, anyway? – but it is one of the most remarkable. Feeling elated, privileged and a little bit emotional, we leave the tree-roo to finish its meal in peace. Sightings are rare. No one knows how many Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroos live on the Atherton Tablelands, and even in the locations where they are reported most frequently, luck plays a major part in spotting one. Malanda Falls conservation park receives about 40,000 visitors a year. In the breeding season, when tree-kangaroos are more active and less wary, one to two sightings a week are reported to the visitors centre. At other times, weeks pass without a notification. Back at Yungaburra, we set out for a walk along Peterson Creek, where another sighting could be possible, with a good chance of seeing a platypus in the slow-flowing waters too. But as we pass the rambling, Federation-era Yungaburra hotel, which is almost as big as the pub in Malanda, we have another idea. Parking on a road lined with hanging baskets of pink and white impatiens, we duck inside. There we raise a glass to the elusive Lumholtz’s tree-kangaroo, still hanging on. Driving is the easiest way around this area. The closest airport to Yungaburra is Cairns, about 70 minutes drive via Gordonvale on the Gillies Range Road or 90 minutes by car via Kuranda on the Kennedy Highway. Yungaburra, Malanda and surrounds offer a variety of accommodation, and places to buy coffee and scones. Wildlife tours are also available from guides on the Atherton Tablelands and in Cairns.",Lifestyle/Travel,Most beautiful mammal?

1/30/2022,"The 2022 Australian federal election will be a de facto referendum on the handling of the pandemic. Like a novice outplayed by a grand master, policymakers have conceded to the forever virus. But on economic matters, platitudes about “building back better” notwithstanding, the fault lines exposed by Covid-19 do not seem to have registered.  First is the abject lack of preparedness. The pandemic was predictable. Recent outbreaks (Sars, Mers and bird flu) were ignored. Governments failed to take the threat seriously. The focus on immediate savings ignoring later costs has meant chronic underinvestment in public health, preventive healthcare and related services, all central to the problems of managing Covid-19. Strategies, including the current “learning to live with the virus” formula, have been haphazard, rarely surviving the briefest contact with reality. While a vaccine was developed quickly, vaccination programs, testing and supplies, such as PPE, doses or rapid antigen tests, have been blighted by repeated failures. It is not a shortage of funds but the lack of competence in building capacity, acquiring and training staff and procuring essentials. Second, Australia’s dependence on personal mobility is evident. Travel restrictions exposed reliance on immigration, foreign workers, educational services and tourism. In recent years, growth has been driven by immigration (at around 1.5% annually among the highest in developed countries). Net arrivals have predictably fallen sharply. Loss of international students and inbound tourists has reduced demand and export revenues, especially affecting some regional economies. Loss of skilled foreign workers and low cost itinerant labour have impacted many sectors, including hospitality and agriculture. A rapid reversion to the pre-Covid status quo remains unlikely. Third, Australia’s service-based economy, focused around health, wellbeing, hospitality, entertainment and leisure, is problematic. This sector, which provides over 80% of all jobs, is vulnerable to social distancing and limits on movement. Even without formal prohibitions, uncertainty, caution and isolation requirements can cripple demand and workforce availability. Few personal services can be delivered virtually. They are also non-storable, perishable products. A hairdresser who has to close for a month may find it difficult to make up the entire lost revenue. In contrast, a manufacturer can meet demand for physical goods where the buyers are willing to wait. This permanent reduction of income makes services more exposed to disruptions of operations. Fourth, the pandemic re-emphasised Australia’s dependence on global supply chains. Decades of outsourcing and offshoring have lowered costs of products, but even essential supplies (food and medical) and strategic products (defence equipment and refined fuel products) must now be imported. As empty shelves and the scramble to secure anything and everything during the pandemic showed, limited onshore manufacturing diminishes policy choices and sovereignty. Fifth, there is little acknowledgment of the accelerant role of inequality in the pandemic. Today, over 40% of the “uber-ised” Australian workforce are casuals or contractors, effectively piece workers. Most small businesses are sole proprietorships or familial concerns, effectively a form of self-employment. Lacking paid leave, continuity of income and adequate financial resources to weather a downturn, they are unable to stop working and act as vectors for transmissible diseases. Health, aged care, food production and many essential services rely on marginalised workers. Low incomes condemn them to sub-standard, often crowded accommodation and long commutes on public or shared transport making infection control and avoiding economic interruptions difficult. Reduction of financial support measures increases vulnerability. Sixth, the pandemic showed that Australia is actually eight municipalities – the states and territories . Differences in economic structure and cultures led to inconsistent health responses and border rules. The constitution and division of powers is not fit for purpose and a barrier to dealing with national issues in a coordinated manner. Finally, the pandemic highlighted the deficit in international cooperation. As of late 2021, around 54% of the global population had received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose. The rate for low-income countries was around 6% due to developed country vaccine nationalism and hoarding. Compounding the problems, Australia is now seeking to poach medical professionals from developing countries denuding them of vital trained resources. Australia, alongside high-income nations, faces human and economic backdrafts from their choices. The continued circulation of Covid-19 increases the risk of further mutations, new waves and disruptions. Poor countries may incubate future public health crises, like new viruses or antibiotic resistant infections. All sides of politics, wary of becoming wedged into electorally damaging positions, avoid confronting these challenges. Emollient slogans – ‘we are in good place’ or ‘push through’ – cannot address these problems. These issues vital to Australia’s future may not even make it onto the election policy agenda.

1/30/2022,"The Vietnamese New Year, Tet Nguyen Dan, is a time of family reunion and feasting, of wishes of good fortune and health. For three years now, Quynh Trang Truong has spent the Tet festival without her husband, Chau Van Kham, who languishes in a Vietnamese prison on terrorism charges, described by human rights groups as a “travesty of justice”.  In that time, Quynh has never been allowed direct contact, nor a single phone call – she has not seen her husband nor heard his voice. “I’m very sad and I miss my husband very much,” she said this week from the Sydney home she has shared with him for decades. “It has been three years, I worry he may die in jail.” A Vietnamese-born Australian citizen, Chau was arrested in January 2019 and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment on “financing terrorism” charges over his membership of pro-democracy group Viet Tan. Human rights advocates, lawyers and Chau’s family said the charges against him were baseless and politically motivated, his single-day multiple-defendant trial was grossly unfair and his failing health means his 12-year prison sentence is “effectively a death sentence”. He has not had a face-to-face consular visit with Australian officials since April last year and there are concerns his health – the 72-year-old has a number of chronic conditions – is failing in prison. He shares a cell with 11 other prisoners and is allowed a single five-minute domestic phone call once a month, to a family member in Vietnam. This month – three years since her husband was arrested – Quynh wrote to the Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, pleading for greater government intervention in his case. “The Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated our stress and fear that our family and I will not be able to see him again. Therefore, I am writing this letter to seek your urgent support and interventions to facilitate my husband’s immediate release and deportation to Australia,” she wrote. “Please help to save my beloved husband, as he is a friendly person who always wants to help and do better things for other people. “My family and I miss him so much, as it has been three years since he was away and endures a prisoner’s life.” Payne visited Hanoi in November to discuss Australia and Vietnam’s “strategic partnership”: her office confirmed the minister has raised Chau’s case in ministerial meetings. A spokesperson for Payne’s department said it was providing consular assistance to Chau and was concerned for his health and welfare “given his age and the length of his sentence”. His last consular visit was in April last year, before visits were suspended under Covid-19 control measures. Those restrictions were lifted earlier this month. “Our embassy is seeking a consular visit as soon as possible,” the spokesperson said. “We continue to seek regular updates from Vietnamese authorities on Mr Kham’s welfare and request regular consular access.” Australian lawyer Dan Phuong Nguyen, who is acting pro bono for Chau’s family, told the Guardian his wife was “very afraid for her husband”. “At this time of year, too, Vietnamese New Year, it is really hitting home to her. She’s very afraid he might die in jail, that she might never see him again.” Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, said Chau’s conviction on terrorism charges was “a travesty of justice”. “The Vietnamese government should pardon Chau and let him return to his family in Australia. Chau has suffered a lot in the last few years. We are very worried about inadequate medical treatment and he hasn’t even seen an Australian consular officer face-to-face since April 2021.” Pearson said the Vietnamese government had a track record of releasing prisoners convicted of crimes into exile outside the country, following concerted political pressure. Chau, an Australian citizen, was born in Vietnam and served in the South Vietnamese army before 1975. After the war, he was sent to a re-education camp for three years before he fled Vietnam by boat, arriving in Australia in 1983. In Sydney, he worked as a baker for decades, rising before dawn to work at a modest suburban bakery. In 2010, he joined Viet Tan, becoming a key Australian organiser of pro-reform rallies and an outspoken advocate for democratisation in Vietnam. The UN describes Viet Tan as “a peaceful organisation advocating for democratic reform”, but it was formally proscribed as a terrorist organisation in 2016 by the Vietnamese government, which said it was “a reactionary and terrorist organisation, always silently carrying out activities against Vietnam”. Chau sought to return to Vietnam in 2019 to meet fellow pro-democracy advocates but was refused a visa. He crossed into Vietnam via a land border with Cambodia in January that year, carrying a false identity document. He was arrested after meeting a democracy activist who, it is believed, was under surveillance, along with two Vietnamese nationals who were later sentenced to 11 and 10 years in prison respectively. Chau was convicted and sentenced at his first appearance in the people’s court of Ho Chi Minh City after more than 10 months in detention. The single-day judge-only trial, held simultaneously with four other people, saw him tried and convicted on charges of “financing terrorism” and sentenced to 12 years in jail, all within four hours. The court was effectively closed – open only to approved people – for the entirety of the trial. His family was excluded. Viet Tan condemned Chau’s hearing as a “sham trial” and said it would “continue to support human rights defenders on the ground”. Kylie Moore-Gilbert, the Australian academic who was detained in Iran for more than two years before being released in an Australian-government-engineered prisoner swap, said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade “​​must do more to ensure his health doesn’t deteriorate further and demand his immediate release”.",News/Australia news,‘It has been three years’: Australian activist’s wife pleads for government help in freeing him from Vietnam jail,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/it-has-been-three-years-australian-activists-wife-pleads-for-government-help-in-freeing-him-from-vietnam-jail
1/30/2022,"Wayne Phillips has both feet firmly on dry land as he acts out cutting a whale loose from fishing gear. The 51-year-old head of marine sciences at SeaWorld in Queensland oversees the park’s marine rescue team – four cutters, a coordinator, a captain and a videographer – who untangle humpback whales that have become bound up in rope and net.  The cutters, he explains, are armed with a gaff – a graphite pole similar to a fishing rod but topped with a reverse knife that doesn’t cut into the whale if it connects – and work in pairs to combat muscle fatigue. Out on the water, with a 27-tonne giant in distress, the purpose-built rubber boat used by the team pitches and rocks on the waves. The goal for the cutters is to aim the gaff to hook the correct rope before pulling it back hard to sever it clean. “You reach out, lunge out and pull back – and all that’s based on where the tail is,” Phillips says. “You might get one or two shots at it, then the whale might divert or dive. “It’s an exhausting process. By the end of the day, you’re buggered.” Phillips has worked in marine rescue for the better part of 28 years, helping dolphins, seals, turtles and other animals when entangled, stranded or sick. Now a growing part of the work involves disentangling humpback whales. Humpback numbers have bounced back from near extinction to about 30,000 in what is widely considered a triumph of conservation. But now the species faces a new human threat: climate change. As the world’s oceans warm and acidify, humpback whales – like other marine species – are altering their ancient migration patterns in search of food and shelter. And as they are wander into new areas along Australia’s coast, the growing overlap with the human world can be lethal. Globally it is estimated 300,000 large whales and dolphins die in entanglements each year, though only a fraction are ever recorded. As definitions vary by jurisdiction, what counts as an entanglement and what gets included in official reports often masks the scale of the problem. According to records collected by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the International Whaling Commission, Australia recorded just 436 whale entanglements between 1887 and 2016. However these records do not include sightings of whales towing gear reported by the public, or whales that have become tangled in crab pot lines. By contrast, Queensland’s shark control program alone recorded 80 humpback whales snagged in its nets between 1992 and 2020. Phillips says there were 28 reports of entangled whales along Australia’s east coast last year, of which his team was able to assist in two. He estimates that despite the best efforts of marine rescue outfits around the coast, only one in five reports are acted upon. Across the country a mix of government agencies and private organisations operate marine rescue teams, each with responsibility for a different area. SeaWorld’s team covers an area that spans south-east Queensland and the northern New South Wales coast as far as Evans Head. Their work generally begins from June, a few months after the first humpback whales are spotted off Sydney on their annual migration north, when the first reports trickle in of whales towing gear – sometimes many metres in length. They will continue until November when the animals leave on their long journey back south, travelling 10,000km to the Antarctic. Phillips says the worst material he has come across is nets that include chain, as it is impossible to cut away the material – though these are rare. By far the most common entanglement are those from crab pots and the ropes that connect the cage on the seafloor to a float on the surface. As whales don’t navigate by echolocation, they will pass through the area and catch rope as they go. Many will try to wriggle free by thrashing or rolling, but often this only binds the ropes tighter. With time the material collects around the whale’s fluke – its tail – stopping it from hunting effectively as it drags the rope material over thousands of kilometres. One juvenile whale was spotted in Antarctic waters trailing gear in early January, having travelled down the South American coast. “It’s like a ball and a chain,” Phillips says. “Imagine dragging that around while you’re swimming. “And then imagine somebody continuously pulling at it because of the drag the water places on that equipment. These animals are so streamlined, they’re built to cut right through the water. Any drag makes it so much harder for them. “It really is a slow death for the animals.” The first step in removing gear is counterintuitive. To cut it off, the team needs to slow the whale down by attaching floats or buoys to the netting it is trailing. It is a tactic that echoes those used by whalers, and from the perspective of the whale the sound of an approaching engine is still cause for alarm. “They’re not always happy we’re trying to help them, that’s for sure,” Phillips says. “They see us as part of the problem initially. And at times we have a very predator-prey relationship with the whale. “He thinks we’re trying to hurt him, so he thinks we’re the predator.” This relationship makes each rescue extremely dangerous. A spooked whale may attempt to roll, dive, thrash or smack its tail, and escort animals, such as adult whales protecting a calf, may attempt to fend off the approaching boats. At least three deaths have been documented among whale rescuers worldwide. Among the earliest was Tom Smith, who died in 2003 while attempting to free a humpback whale in waters off Kaikoura in New Zealand. His body was never recovered. Canadian whale rescue veteran Joe Howlett, 59, was killed in 2017 moments after successfully freeing an endangered northern right whale in the Gulf of St Lawrence. Phillips says members of the public should never attempt their own rescue. Even if it does not end in tragedy, it often only makes things worse for the animal. “Their hearts are in the right place, but if they don’t cut it all off it actually makes our job harder,” he says. “When they cut off some of the net, the whale will swim off quite nicely but unfortunately it’s still a death sentence. “Any material around that fluke means the whale will end up succumbing.” Dr Olaf Meynecke, a whale researcher at Griffith University and the Whales & Climate program – a collaborative research project between six universities – says climate change is already having an indirect impact on the number of entanglements. “It’s the food source that drives everything in the whales’ lives, and they’re migrating for six months at a time each year. That requires a lot of energy,” Meynecke says. “Their advantage is they can store energy in their blubber as fat, but that also means there’s a short amount of time to eat.” Climate change is affecting the location and amount of available food. Meynecke says other whale species have been pushing into waters close to humans, and it is expected the same is happening with humpbacks in Australia. The most at-risk of entanglement are “overwintering” whales – usually young, non-breeding females that stay in Australian coastal waters through summer and end up trying to opportunistically feed near commercial fishing grounds. Meynecke’s research aims to forecast how these changes will occur until 2050 by comparing whale movements today with those from hundreds of years ago. He says there are signs whale populations are already starting to arrive earlier than expected and are not always travelling as far north as they used to. If confirmed, there may be steps that can be taken to prevent more animals being lost. But that would require coordination between governments, science, industry and the whale-watching public to create more centralised reporting systems, change fishing practices, introduce ropeless fishing gear and ban the use of material such as chain in nets. This might seem a tall order, but Meynecke says the legacy of anti-whaling efforts in the past is a generational shift that has made humpback whales a sacrosanct part of Australian culture. “It’s been a complete shift in society,” he says. “Our society has gone from ‘I appreciate whaling’ to ‘I appreciate taking photos of whales and paying for it’. “No one in Australia – not one politician – would ever today come and say let’s kill the whales. This gives me great hope. It shows a capacity for change.”",News/Environment,The kindest cut: the Australians fighting to save humpback whales tangled in fishing nets,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/30/the-kindest-cut-the-australians-fighting-to-save-humpback-whales-tangled-in-fishing-nets
1/30/2022,"It was once a rule as sure as gravity: buy a 2012 Toyota in January and it would be worthless by December. But if you’ve bought a secondhand car anytime over the last two years, it should be pretty obvious that rule hasn’t held true during the pandemic as prices have been driven up by 50% on some models in Australia and overseas.  So as some people struggle in the booming secondhand car market and others cash in, how did this happen? And what does the future hold? Details may differ by model and manufacturer but the average car has about 30,000 components, and with modern carmaking having evolved to be an intricate global dance – with parts made in one country and shipped to another for assembly – the industry depends on its ability to move things around. Since the start of the pandemic global supply chains have taken a hit, making tight carmaking logistics shaky. Competition for cargo space and a shortage of shipping containers has led to long delivery times for people who have bought a new car. A global computer chip shortage – sometimes referred to as “chippaggedon” – means carmakers are competing with other industries for chips. Modern cars can have more than 1,000 chips – for control of everything from mirrors to airbags and tyre pressure gauges. Faced with long delivery times and a perceived risk of taking public transport due to Covid, many people have turned to the secondhand car market. With fewer cars and more people wanting them, a seller’s market has developed. From the moment the pandemic began – and certainly long enough for insurance company Allianz to run and publish the results of a survey in November 2021 showing Australians were confused and overwhelmed as they navigated the market. It depends what you are in the market for, as there are many variables. According to CarsGuide, those shopping for an early 2011 Ford Ranger would be paying $24,000, up from $18,000 in June 2020 – a 40% increase. In the small car market, a $10,000 2021 Mazda3 now costs about $12,000, which is more modest but still large, particularly for families looking to buy a new driver their first car. While a Mazda3 that cost $26,000 when new in mid-2020 can be bought secondhand for about $34,000. Another classic example is the Land Cruiser. At the start of the pandemic those who couldn’t fly overseas decided it might be worth buying a 4WD and driving around Australia. Unfortunately, many people had the same thought at the same time and the price jumped as there weren’t that many around. That has had a flow-on effect for work vehicles for tradies, farmers and mining companies. For example, dual-cab 79 series GXL Land Cruisers, which usually retail for about $80,000 new are now being sold secondhand for more than $100,000. “That’s the million-dollar question and it keeps getting pushed out,” says James Voortman, chief executive of the Australian Automotive Dealers Association. “At the moment we’re getting told by manufacturers around the world, we’re hopeful the semiconductor shortage will start to improve by the middle of this year.” As global supply chains sort out their kinks, prices are expected to fall over 2022 – though there are conflicting views on how far. One school of thought says that because people buy cars when they need them, they are slow to buy new ones, meaning the supply of available cars is likely to grow quickly. This will lead to a slow fall in prices. Global consultancy firm KPMG is however forecasting a 30% reduction in current prices in the US by the end of 2022 as carmakers begin delivering new cars to market. Though the analysis may be focused on the US, as the problems are global they can be generalised to Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Any correction is not without risk. KPMG’s report says that any drop in prices is good for those looking to buy but those who bought over the last two years will be left with a vehicle worth less than they paid for. While this may make it harder for them to make their next vehicle purchase, others who relied on a loan may find themselves underwater. However until prices actually begin to drop, this is an issue on the distant horizon. Wait six months, and see where things land – though if you can wait longer, maybe give it a year. If you absolutely have to buy now, remember that you don’t need to just accept the sticker price and it is OK to haggle. Depending on the circumstances and your approach it might be possible to bring down the price by 20%.",News/Australia news,Secondhand cars: why are they so expensive and when will prices drop?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/secondhand-cars-why-are-they-so-expensive-and-when-will-prices-drop
1/30/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing damaging new revelations about his relationship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri after hundreds of page of notes and documents were handed to officials at the Greater London Authority (GLA) overseeing two separate investigations into their affair. Last month the GLA oversight committee summonsed and received a significant number of documents – including emails to and from Arcuri – from a London tourism and promotional agency as part of an inquiry into whether Johnson abused his position as London mayor to “benefit and reward” the American businesswoman.  Arcuri was given access to foreign trade missions led by the future prime minister and sponsorship for her events business, raising questions about conflicts of interest. Arcuri is also said to be cooperating fully with a separate investigation by the GLA’s ethics watchdog that raises the prospect of Johnson facing an investigation for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office. City Hall sources said that Arcuri was “in current dialogue” with the GLA monitoring officer and is understood to have offered hundreds of fresh pages of notes and text messages chronicling her affair with Johnson when he was London mayor. A spokesperson for the GLA confirmed the officer was “continuing to gather information in order to assess the complaint” regarding Johnson’s dealings with Arcuri and would report “in due course”. The Observer revealed last year that Johnson had allegedly overruled the advice of staff to promote the business interests of Arcuri and win her affections. Arcuri’s contemporaneous diary excerpts, which she passed on to the journalist John Ware, prompted the GLA to restart its investigation. A previous investigation into Johnson’s business relationship with the then 27-year-old Arcuri saw the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) decide not to open a criminal inquiry into his relationship with her. However, that inquiry did not have access to Arcuri’s handwritten diary entries in which the Californian entrepreneur made “verbatim” notes about her relationship with Johnson. Her previously undisclosed evidence is potentially even more critical because the original IOPC inquiry was hampered by the deletion of key email and phone records at City Hall that prevented the watchdog from “reviewing relevant evidence”. Arcuri’s continuing cooperation with the GLA monitoring officer paves the way for a possible referral to the IOPC to potentially launch an investigation into misconduct in public office, which Johnson has denied. Meanwhile, it has also emerged that the GLA oversight committee has asked and received unredacted documents from London & Partners (L&P), the tourism and promotional agency that organised the foreign trade trips led by Johnson that Arcuri was given places on. The investigation is focused on “the payment of sponsorship monies and the access afforded to those who participated in mayoral trade missions”. Arcuri received £126,000 of public money in the form of grants for her technology business and event sponsorship and received access to three foreign trade missions led by Johnson. Arcuri has stated that the grants and access to L&P trips between 2013 and 2014 had no connection to her relationship with the mayor. Johnson made no mention of Arcuri in his declaration of interest as mayor, but has denied any wrongdoing. Caroline Pidgeon, chair of the GLA oversight committee, said: “We asked for unredacted copies of these documents because we need to know the full details of the evidence for our investigation into overseas visits and sponsorship monies. “We need clarification around the specific people involved to ensure our investigation is complete.” When the inquiry is completed, the committee will publish a report and series of recommendations. A government spokesperson has previously stated that “as mayor, Boris Johnson followed all the legal requirements in the Greater London Assembly’s [sic] code of conduct at the time”.",News/Politics,Fresh revelations about Jennifer Arcuri affair threaten to damage Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/fresh-revelations-about-jennifer-arcuri-affair-threaten-to-damage-boris-johnson
1/30/2022,"The Victorian justice department spent more than $250,000 on a religious chaplaincy program that prison staff feared would put volunteers at risk, an internal report has found. The report raised concerns that improperly trained volunteers were collecting inmates from prisons on their day of release and using the car trip to the prisoner’s accommodation to speak to them about Christianity.  It also found the program seemingly breached the department’s own funding guidelines, which prevented it from employing faith-based chaplains.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I wouldn’t put a volunteer in a car for four hours with some of these guys while they’re trying to torment them to join a faith,” one staff member from Beechworth prison said in the report. “That is a very dangerous move with some of them ... and, I must admit, I detect a degree of frustration and anger [from ex-prisoners about the program].” The review of the Transition 24 project is contained in 1,200 pages of Victorian justice department documents released late last year to a parliamentary inquiry. It found that the $264,000 provided by the department over three years to Prison Fellowship Victoria and Friends of Dismas, the Christian organisations that delivered the program, appeared to breach the commissioner of corrections guidelines on spirituality and religion in prisons. Those guidelines state that chaplains are to be employees of their faith communities, not the prison provider. But the report found that much of the work conducted under the publicly funded program was religiously based, and recommended the department ensure the guidelines and terms of the contract were not being breached. There was no indication Prison Fellowship Victoria had willingly breached the contract or that the organisation had committed any wrongdoing. All the “deliverables” under the contract were met, the review found. The July 2019 evaluation found that the project was designed to provide specialist transitional support to older prisoners immediately before and after their release from prison. The number of elderly prisoners (defined as aged 50 and older) had increased from 479 prisoners in 2007 to 1,027 in 2017, the report found. Under the program, the most common support provided was volunteers who would pick up prisoners on their day of release, often from prisons in regional Victoria, and transport them to accommodation. Further support could be provided in terms of counselling and release packages, the report found, though it had not been clear to prison staff that much of this would be religiously based. “If it was something like social support, social contact, that is great,” a worker at the Marngoneet women’s prison said in the report. “If it’s about, ‘hey, come along to church with me’... that’s not so great.” A worker from the same prison also said: “With the recent royal commission into institutional child sexual abuse, we have a lot of victims of religious-based organisations here. “So … that [could] be quite traumatic, someone here not aware that that’s actually where their counselling and mentoring is coming from.” The report, which was completed by the department, also found that the program had planned to give participants a book called Out!: You’ll Get Through – I’ve Been There, which contained a “collection of stories from ex-prisoners describing their journey in ‘staying out of prison’”. “A closer look [at] the stories found that the majority of the stories in this book credited their faith in God as being important to them staying out of prison,” the report found. Richard Boonstra, the Victorian state manager for Prison Fellowship Australia, confirmed that the state government was no longer funding the program. But he told Guardian Australia that volunteers still collected inmates from Victorian prisons on their day of release, though he estimated it was fewer than 20 a year. Although Boonstra was not employed in the position at the time of the review or at any time while the program was funded by the state government, he said he was confident volunteers were properly trained in how to protect themselves and to respect ex-prisoners. “It’s not that ‘you have a captive audience now, it’s an opportunity to catch them’,” he said. “[In volunteer training] we talk about boundaries and developing a mentor rather than a friendship relationship. “There’s no pushing or proselytising or anything … Our volunteers are very careful about things like that.” The justice department confirmed the program was not funded again after the completion of the review but declined to comment further.",News/Australia news,"Victorian prison staff feared $250,000 religious chaplaincy program could endanger volunteers",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/victorian-prison-staff-feared-250000-religious-chaplaincy-program-could-endanger-volunteers
1/30/2022,"Plans for the weekend. Comments on the weather. Observations about a colleague’s new coat. With offices across England (and, from Monday, in Scotland) opening up to workers, casual conversation starters like this will once again become the norm. But after nearly two years of working predominantly from home, an absence of informal interaction with colleagues has left some employees so out of practice at watercooler chat that they are turning to small talk coaching to prepare.  Georgie Nightingall, the founder of Trigger Conversations, says she has seen a sharp rise in uptake for her conversational training courses – in which she teaches people how to improve their small talk – with demand quadrupling within a year. “There is concern, partly due to the pandemic, that people are just losing these skills,” said Nightingall, 30. But she said any issues tend to be closely linked to confidence. Citing research that found that small talk plays a vital role in contributing to day-to-day happiness, helping to prevent loneliness and isolation, she said remote working does not allow it to occur in the same way in the “in-between moments” that come from physical proximity in between meetings, in corridors, at lunch or at coffee machines. “So suddenly there are no opportunities to have that serendipity that normally happens,” she said. Almuth McDowall, professor and assistant dean of organisational psychology at Birkbeck, University of London and associate fellow of the British Psychological Society, said small talk “humanises our work existence” and provides a space for idea exchange and creativity. The return to workplaces is an opportunity to re-evaluate its purpose, she said. “Let’s rethink what the office is for – a place to find meaning, connection and a shared purpose.” Nightingall said many people dread small talk because they do not know how to use it properly and fear getting “trapped in this circle of talking about the weather”. Instead, she teaches students to move away from key phrases like “I’m fine” or “what did you do at the weekend?” and use seemingly mundane subjects as a springboard to having a meaningful conversation. “Often in conversations we have this competing paradox of ‘Oh, I really want to be connected to somebody and have that lovely feeling of belonging and conversation’ but at the same time ‘Ah, I don’t really want to get into a conversation because it’s going to take a lot of energy and it’s going to drain me, I’m not going to be great at it’,” she said. In an online taster session for her six-week course, Transformational Conversations, she admitted that she is a “small talk convert” and that she used to hate it until she started working on how to transform her everyday conversations into the deeper kind she would have at a party at 2am. Her teaching includes group conversations, partner exercises in practicing using different techniques, breaking the scripts of conventional small talk and starting conversations with statements. The results, she claims, can be life-changing. “Every part of our lives starts to transform because we become better listeners, more curious, more interested, more aware and suddenly you’re having better conversations on dates, with your parents and with people on the street in your local community.” Sam Denny, a data scientist from London, signed up to Nightingall’s course after he found his world had shrunk living alone and working from home during the pandemic and he was feeling anxious about returning to the office and interacting with colleagues. “If you are entirely working from home it’s very easy to have all your conversations being completely purpose-driven,” said Denny, 33. Since doing the course he said his confidence has increased, he feels able to lead small talk and is looking forward to seeing colleagues. “Before I would be quite shy, quite quiet and I would let the conversation go wherever it would go and often maybe not to very interesting places.” 1. Move away from core phrases, advises conversations expert Georgie Nightingall. Instead of asking “how was your weekend?” try asking “what was the most surprising thing that happened on the weekend?” 2. Get out of your own head and be curious. Instead of assuming the conversation is going to be boring, listen to what people are saying and ask follow-up questions. 3. Take the lead and set the tone by sharing information. Like a dance, an enjoyable conversation does not come out of two followers. Make statements about yourself, others and the environment and ask questions.",Lifestyle/Money,Covid got your tongue?
