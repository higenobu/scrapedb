5/1/2022,"The so-called Ghost of Kyiv died in battle last month, reports say. It is claimed the pilot ace shot down as many as 40 Russian aircraft during the war. Although many speculated that he was a myth, his identity has been revealed to be Major Stepan Tarabalka. A famed Ukrainian fighter pilot nicknamed the Ghost of Kyiv has died in battle, local sources told The Times of London. The Ghost of Kyiv first emerged when the Ukrainian government tweeted a video crediting the then-unnamed pilot with shooting down six Russian aircraft on the first day of the war. It has been claimed he went on to shoot down up to 40 Russian aircraft. His identity has now been revealed as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29, killed on March 13 when ""overwhelming"" Russian forces shot down the MiG-29 he was flying, The Times said. Ukrainian sources told the paper that his helmet and goggles are expected to go on sale at auction in London. ""People call him the Ghost of Kyiv. And rightly so â€” this UAF ace dominates the skies over our capital and country, and has already become a nightmare for invading Russian aircraft,"" the tweet said. Days before his death, Ukraine's General Staff released an image of the fighter pilot in the cockpit of his MiG-29 jet with his face hidden, with the caption: ""Hello, occupier, I'm coming for your soul!"" Because his identity was kept a secret, many speculated that the Ghost of Kyiv was a myth designed to boost Ukrainian morale. However, the government continued to insist that he was real. Tarabalka was born in the small village of Korolivka to a working-class family and graduated from the Kharkiv National University of the Air Force, The Times reported. He leaves behind his wife Olena and their eight-year-old son Yarik. His parents, Ivan and Natalia, gave an interview to NPR following their son's death and detailed his lifelong dream to become a fighter pilot. ""He would always watch the paratroopers in their air exercises. And he would run in their direction to try to see where they landed. Since early childhood, he always dreamed of the sky, about flying higher than the clouds,"" his mother Natalia told NPR. His father told NPR that they were not told the details of their son's final flight, only that he did not return after completing a mission. His parents confirmed that the fighter pilot had been posthumously awarded Ukraine's top medal for bravery in combat, the Order of the Golden Star, with the title Hero of Ukraine. ""Of course, he had already earned and deserved this medal, this honor, when he was with us,"" Ivan told NPR. ""We are proud of him. But we wish he would get this honor after the war. We wish he were still alive.""

5/1/2022,"BATAJNICA, Serbia (Reuters) - Serbia on Saturday showed off its new Chinese-made surface-to-air missiles and other military hardware purchased from both Russia and the West, as the country seeks to perform a delicate balancing act over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Members of the public and the media were invited to the display at the Batajnica military airfield near Belgrade, where Chinese and French missiles were lined up beside Airbus helicopters, Chinese-armed drones and Russian MIG-29 jets. Serbia is striving to balance its partnership with NATO and aspirations to join the European Union with its centuries-old religious, ethnic and political alliance with Russia. The Chinese FK-3 surface-to-air defence system, similar to Russia's S-300 or the U.S. Patriot system, was purchased by Belgrade in 2019 and delivered earlier this month. Serbia is currently the only European country to operate the Chinese missile system and CH-92A combat drones. President Aleksandar Vucic toured Saturday's display flanked by military commanders and watched an aerobatics show featuring overhauled MIG-29 jets donated by Russia in 2017. ""I'm proud of the Serbian army, I'm proud of a great progress,"" Vucic told a news conference. ""We're going to significantly strengthen our fighter air force ... Serbia is a neutral country and Serbia must find solutions enabling it to preserve its sky and its state."" The delivery of the FK-3 missile system prompted several Western countries, including Germany, to warn Belgrade it expected the Balkan country to align its foreign policy with the EU if it wanted to become a member. Belgrade has voted against Russia three times at the United Nations but stopped short of imposing sanctions against it. Serbia's military is loosely based on ex-Soviet technology and Russia is one of its main suppliers. Belgrade is also dependant on natural gas and oil supplies from Russia. Vucic said Serbia expects to purchase 12 Rafale multipurpose fighter jets from France by the end of the year or early next year, a move seen by political analysts as a sign of Belgrade distancing itself from Russia. He said Serbia is also negotiating to buy 12 Typhoon combat aircraft from Britain.
