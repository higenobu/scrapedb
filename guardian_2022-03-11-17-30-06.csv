3/11/2022,"As many as a third of all child deaths from Covid in the US have occurred during the Omicron surge of the pandemic. Children seem to be facing increasing risks from Covid-19 even as mask mandates drop across the country, and vaccination rates among children stall out at alarmingly low rates. “We saw a massive surge of hospitalized young children during Omicron that we didn’t see in the earlier months of the pandemic,” said Jake Kane, a pediatric intensivist and associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Comer children’s hospital. Since the beginning of the year, 550 children have died from Covid-19 in the US, compared with 1,017 children in the preceding 22 months, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Omicron was first identified in November, and within weeks became the dominant variant in the US. Although Omicron is less severe than Delta, it is three to five times worse than previous variants, recent CDC research shows. The variant may also affect younger children in different ways than previous versions of the virus. Omicron tends to infect the upper airways, which in children are narrower and can be more easily irritated. “Omicron really did something different than Delta, and I don’t think it was just because more kids were infected,” Kane said. He saw younger patients with illnesses similar to croup and bronchiolitis, which can be dangerous in young children with “a pediatric airway the diameter of a pencil”, he said. “It’s no longer fair even to insinuate that Covid doesn’t affect children, that Covid deaths are only in unhealthy children or kids with risk factors. That’s just not true, by the data.” The under-five age group saw record-high hospitalizations over the past few months. Omicron hospitalization rates for kids under the age of five soared five times higher at Omicron’s peak than during the Delta wave, according to recent CDC research. Among all ages of children, those under one may face the highest risk of severe disease, yet they are not able to take many of the precautions available to older people. Children under two cannot wear face masks, and children under five are not yet eligible for Covid vaccination. Nearly 5 million children have been infected with Covid in 2022, and cases are now sharply declining. The majority of children who become infected with Covid have mild cases, but that may change as variants evolve and emerge – Kane called it the “million-dollar question”. “Omicron has been very bad for kids. We don’t know what future variants will do,” said Julia Raifman, assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, who flagged the sharp uptick in Omicron deaths. “We don’t have a good enough understanding of what protection there is from prior infection, how long it lasts, how robust it is.” In coming months, she said, “we’ll see a lot more infection, and more cases will always mean more hospitalizations and deaths,” especially with low vaccination rates. Florida’s surgeon general recently recommended against vaccinating “healthy” kids given the possibility of side-effects, which remain extremely rare and are outweighed by the vaccines’ protection. Vaccines are highly effective against severe illness, hospitalization and death for eligible children. But less than 30% of children between the ages of five and 11 are vaccinated in the US, and a little more than half of children 12 to 17 are vaccinated. Preventive measures like masks should stay in place at schools and daycares, as well as parents’ workplaces and public transportation, in order to protect children as long as the virus is circulating, Raifman said. “The kids who are too young to wear masks really need other people to reduce transmission around them,” she said. Requiring face masks in schools during the Delta wave last fall helped reduce Covid cases by 23%, according to CDC research published on Tuesday. A nationwide child vaccination campaign is very important as well, Raifman said – especially one in multiple languages that focuses on low-income communities where not enough families have gotten vaccinated. Covid has hit marginalized communities harder – and vaccination rates and access to medical care tend to be lower in the same communities, creating a double whammy, Kane said. Vaccines provide some protection against infection, which helps keep the virus from spreading, and they also offer excellent protection against hospitalization and death. Vaccinating and boosting those who are eligible would help protect children too young to be eligible themselves, as well as providing other important benefits, Raifman said. “We’ve never achieved high-enough vaccinations in the United States – we lag far behind other countries – and it makes us really vulnerable to continued high rates of death, hospitalization, societal disruption, economic disruption.” And deaths are only one measure of Covid’s effects, she said. “Long Covid is also a concern for kids; the record-high hospitalizations are concerning for kids.” Amid the fear and exhaustion of the Omicron surge, Kane’s overwhelming feeling was frustration, because proven measures are available to keep many children from becoming severely ill or dying. “Kids shouldn’t die,” he said. “Kids shouldn’t die.”",News/World news,One-third of all US child Covid deaths occurred during Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/us-child-covid-deaths-omicron-surge
3/11/2022,"All week, we’d been rehearsing how my friend should leave her job. Specifically, where to land her resignation speech on the spectrum between a cathartic, spite-filled rant and something more businesslike. She was quitting because the money was terrible, the hours were terrible, it was incredibly stressful and she felt constantly gaslit and undermined by a boss who while giving her a dumb assignment would assure her it was consolidating her “brand”. We could rake over her motivation until the cows came home, but her reasons for quitting basically boiled down to one thing: “I’ve had a gutful,” she said (she’s Australian). In the last year, the urge to quit has jumped from a staple background whinge to a startling mass action. In November last year in the US, the number of people leaving their jobs reached a record high of 4.53 million. These were not people working in finance. For the most part, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the highest concentration of workers walking out of their jobs fell in the leisure and hospitality industry, shortly followed by retail workers – that is, in the middle to lower wage brackets. Surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center found the reasons people cited for leaving were low pay, feeling stuck and “disrespect”. In other words, nothing out of the ordinary. But where in previous years these kinds of discomforts might have been weathered indefinitely, or until a better option came along, now people were snapping and walking out. My friend who was quitting had plenty of plans but no solid job offer to go to. She was quitting cold, unable to stand it for a second longer, which seemed to be the pattern elsewhere. Another friend quit her job a few weeks ago, somewhat to her own surprise. When I asked what had prompted it, she said, “the pandemic distilled things to the core attributes”, and mentioned the effect of all those months at home giving her more time to think. An exhausted labour force is, generally, a more compliant one than workers who have a little time and space to take stock. Furthermore, said my friend, any employer who had not “displayed full empathy” during the pandemic appeared guilty of something much worse than bad management. If we have all been through the equivalent of a collective near-death experience, the urge to embrace a radical life change makes sense. In the US, pandemic relief payments from the federal government gave people a small amount of “fuck you” money. And the thrill of being on the other side of something as large as an entire world that shut down is a head-rush it’s hard to ignore. Quitting hasn’t been the only expression of this feeling. Relative to the sheer scale of the psychic ground covered over the past two years, other types of movement seem trivial. In my children’s school, there has been more intake churn, and more evidence of people selling up and moving across the country, than anything seen prior to 2020. Still, for many of us social conformity and conditioning run deep. “Am I being a brat?” said my friend. We’d been round this cul-de-sac before. Most people hate their jobs; having a job was a privilege; where did boldness stop and recklessness begin? At root, what made her think she deserved better? We talked about the endless books and podcasts that foreground the success of people who quit – like Jeff Bezos quitting finance to start Amazon – and how the thousands of people for whom this risk presumably didn’t pay off never get much of a look-in. We discussed whether there was some middle ground, where she might scale down to part time. Every one of these discussions ended in despair. We have one life. What is there to gamble on if it isn’t yourself? I think you should take the moral high ground, I said: tell them you could string them along while you look for something else, but that it’s better all round if you quit. We did a few role plays, all of which ended in hysteria when one or other of us addressed the boss character as “madam”. We tried to anticipate what horrible things would be said to her in the course of resigning. “It’s abusive”, we said of her workplace, which is true. As a single contributor to the Great Resignation, my friend is part of a movement that at a distance looks seamless, even easy, but behind the scenes is riven with anxiety and self-doubt. Late yesterday, her boss cancelled the meeting at the last minute. My friend felt a combination of relief, disappointment and shame at not being able to execute her plan. She’ll do it next week.

3/11/2022,"Brighton’s four defeats on the spin appeared to come from nowhere and, in the space of three weeks, doubled their number of losses for the season. They will not be relegated but a European spot is surely now out of the question, with no guarantees things will turn dramatically when Liverpool visit. “Every team will have a tough period and we’re going through ours now,” said the midfielder Steven Alzate, one of few Seagulls players to come out with much credit from the defeat at Newcastle. Brighton do tend to give Liverpool a game, on the positive side. They drew this fixture last season and their comeback from two down to earn a point at Anfield may yet come to be an episode Jürgen Klopp regrets bitterly when he looks back at the title race. Before what looks to be a defining four weeks for Klopp’s hopes, with Liverpool due to visit Arsenal and Manchester City, Alzate and company will hope to put another huge spanner in the works. NA Brighton v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT) The equation is fairly simple for Manchester United and Tottenham. This is a game neither can really afford to lose as they pursue Arsenal for a top-four spot. In the hosts’ case, losing further ground when the Gunners will have four games in hand on Saturday night would be particularly costly. A win would at least put them fourth and give rivals something to topple. It will be intriguing to see how these two sides respond, respectively, to a crushing derby defeat and a thumping win over a dejected Everton. Spurs’ lack of consistency is chronic but a fourth league win in five would alleviate some of Antonio Conte’s concerns and show their sensational victory last time they were in Manchester was no fluke. For United, all bets are off, whether or not Cristiano Ronaldo is able to return from his hip flexor problem. It would not be shocking to see either side win by two or three. Given their new-found position of supremacy, Arsenal can have fun sitting back and seeing who comes off worse. NA Manchester United v Tottenham, Saturday 5.30pm Even if she had hacked into the Premier League’s fixture computer, a Russian cyber felon could hardly have arranged a more striking match-up for Chelsea. After a week in which the west London club have had a financial clamp put on them because of their owner’s undesirable connections, Thomas Tuchel’s side are to host none other than Newcastle United, a de facto public relations vehicle for a Saudi regime accused of committing war crimes in Yemen, among other atrocities. Sunday’s match at Stamford Bridge will be brought to you in association with Hypocrisy. PD Chelsea v Newcastle, Sunday 12.30pm Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 Not for the first time since their takeover, Wolves got themselves into a brilliant position from which to attack a top-four spot, then flopped. Last time it happened, in 2019-20, it was easy to blame Nuno Espiríto Santo, whose tepid approach did a colossal disservice to a talented group who were capable of much better. Bruno Lage generally sends his team out to play positively and yet, the moment the Champions League was in sight, things again went wrong. Wolves were knocked out of the FA Cup by Norwich and then beaten at home by Arsenal. After rallying with two wins, Lage’s side then lost three in a row, their late collapse in the Arsenal return particularly embarrassing. Victory over Watford, though, means they travel to Merseyside in good heart, to meet another relegation-threatened side. There’s a good chance this will be the nerviest, scrappiest match of the weekend – and all the more enjoyable for it. DH Everton v Wolves, Sunday 2pm The good news keeps on coming for Arsenal. Jamie Vardy has scored 11 times against them in 14 appearances and, in Leicester’s last two visits to the Emirates, came up with game-altering goals in the dying minutes. Aaron Ramsdale, who was not on the receiving end of those contributions but has faced Vardy with Bournemouth and Sheffield United, says the striker is “the one I hate playing against most”. On Sunday Ramsdale and his teammates will be spared. Vardy has a knee problem and will miss the next month or so, meaning Arsenal are at no risk of a repeat performance from their nemesis. Not so long ago, Leicester were widely seen as the shining example for a flailing Arsenal. The league table does not make that case anymore and a fifth straight win looks well within Mikel Arteta’s grasp, especially as the Foxes faced Rennes on Thursday night. Vardy’s absence will do the hosts no harm. NA Arsenal v Leicester, Sunday 4.30pm Dean Smith described last weekend’s match against Brentford as a “must-not-lose”. Unfortunately, Norwich lost it. Saturday brings another six-pointer against Leeds, dragged into the relegation mire following the desperate run that brought an end to Marcelo Bielsa’s tenure. There is still hope for Norwich, because Everton may also be in free-fall. It was Norwich’s 2-1 win at Carrow Road in January that prompted the dismissal of Rafael Benítez and the subsequent arrival of Frank Lampard. If Norwich can muster maximum points against another relegation rival it probably won’t prompt another managerial change – it will only be Jesse Marsch’s third match in charge – but the battle to avoid the drop could look tighter than ever. LM Leeds United v Norwich, Sunday 2pm Another six-pointer? There is an argument that Burnley’s visit to Brentford constitutes one of those, given Sean Dyche’s side can catch up with the Bees by winning their two games in hand. Brentford have played more times than anyone in the bottom half and are far from out of the woods, although last weekend’s convincing win at Norwich offered huge relief after a torrid run. Safety will loom into view if they can break Burnley down. Christian Eriksen’s presence could work wonders, given the guile he has added. The Danish playmaker was excellent against the Canaries in his first start and has returned in remarkably good shape. Burnley were brought sharply down to earth from their upturn in form by successive home defeats to Leicester and Chelsea, and this is not the time for grinding out draws. NA Brentford v Burnley, Saturday 3pm As one of only two teams to have beaten Manchester City in the Premier League this season, Crystal Palace may be one of the biggest obstacles remaining between Pep Guardiola’s side and another title triumph. Aymeric Laporte certainly cannot dispute that claim. The centre-back seems very likely to start with Rúben Dias out injured, but was given the run-around by Palace in October. Laporte was dispossessed in the build-up Palace’s first goal and was tormented by Wilfried Zaha for 45 minutes before getting himself sent off for hacking the forward down. Liverpool, who certainly know what it is like to blow a title chance at Selhurst Park, will be hoping for more of the same on Monday. PD Crystal Palace v Manchester City, Monday 8pm It’s been a mixed start at Villa Park for Steven Gerrard. In 14 league games, his team have beaten just one side currently sitting in the top half of the table – Southampton, last week. And there remain questions about Gerrard’s management. Perhaps he got lucky at Rangers, taking advantage of Celtic’s unsuccessful rehiring of Neil Lennon. Gerrard’s old side, meanwhile, look just as good under Giovanni van Bronckhorst. Though he’s still learning the role, the importance of a “well done” from someone of his standing as a player should not be underestimated. He may have hit upon the formation which serves his best players best. The 4-3-1-2 he has adopted gives him solidity and enterprise in midfield, allows Philippe Coutinho to roam, and imposes both Ollie Watkins and Danny Ings upon opposing centre-backs. Villa should fancy their chances against a weary West Ham. DH West Ham v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm In addition to Ralph Hassenhüttl’s gripes about Newcastle’s January signings and their postponed meeting, he now has some good old-fashioned fixture congestion to deal with, with three matches to play in nine days. After a heartening run, last weekend’s heavy defeat by Aston Villa was a significant wobble. The return of Mohammed Salisu, one of Saints’ outstanding performers this season among a buoyant squad, is a reason to be cheerful and to enjoy for now. Trying to hang on to Saints’ best players, such as Salisu, in the summer will shift into focus over the coming weeks.

3/11/2022,"Half a century on from 1972, the Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky series in Reykjavik remains the most famous of all world championship matches. It triggered a global chess boom, not least in Britain where for a brief period a galaxy of talent made England the No 2 chess nation behind the Soviet Union. Reykjavik has another tradition, its annual international open first staged in 1964 when the legendary Mikhail Tal outclassed the field with 12.5/13. The 2022 edition at the Harpa Conference Centre from 6-12 April has a tight schedule of nine rounds in seven days, zero Covid restrictions, and morning excursions which include a visit to Fischer’s grave. There are no Russians or Ukrainians, few Americans, and the four top seeds are all from India. England has one of the largest contingents, 31, most of whom are amateurs rated below 2000. GM Simon Williams is the leading English player, and Reykjavik will also test England’s most promising juniors. Jonah Willow, 19, of Nottingham, and Harry Grieve, 20, of Guildford, already have international master norms and are closing in on the title, while Shreyas Royal, 13, missed his first norm by just half a point at Ilkley last week. Grieve also represents Cambridge in the annual varsity match, first staged in 1873 and the longest running annual fixture in world chess. This Saturday’s renewal at its traditional venue, the RAC in Pall Mall, London, will be online at chess24.com (12.30pm start). GMs Michael Adams, Luke McShane and Gawain Jones were on top board for their German clubs when the 2022 Bundesliga season opened last week. All six games were halved, with the pick being McShane’s eventful draw with the new German star Vincent Keymer, 17. Keymer looked superior with his mobile central pawns until McShane, after half an hour’s thought, found the tactic 17 Bf4! This could have given the English GM the full point with 20 Nf5! regaining the sacrificed piece with advantage, but instead he settled for perpetual check. England’s other active top grandmaster, David Howell, is currently playing a £15,000 10-game classical match in London against Sweden’s No 1, Nils Grandelius.

The first major weekend congress of 2022 takes place at the Imperial Hotel, Blackpool, from Friday until Sunday, with 350-400 entries expected, five sections, and £6,700 in prizes including £700 for the Lancashire Open winner. Due to the pandemic and/or venue problems, many popular congresses were cancelled in 2021, so players are eager for action. An exception seems to be experts and near-masters. Blackpool’s top seed is 2520-rated Danny Gormally, the England No 12, but only four others are rated above 2300. This is a distinct weakening compared with many previous years, when Michael Adams, Matthew Sadler, and Stuart Conquest were listed among the winners. Blackpool’s experience seems to reflect a general downsizing of weekend events, which in turn relates to the boom in online play, One-day rapidplays rather than two-day weekenders are becoming the norm, opens rarely have a prize structure to attract masters, let alone GMs, while the ECF seems to have quietly abandoned its long established congress Grand Prix for the best overall performances in a season. In the 1970s, the heyday of English weekend congresses, the Grand Prix had a £1,000 first prize and even had an opening named after it – the Grand Prix Attack against the Sicilian 1 e4 c5 with Nc3, Bc4, f4, Nf3, 0-0, Qe1-h4, f5 and an easy to play assault against the black king. Richard Rapport defeated Maxime Vachier-Lagrave 1.5-0.5 in the Belgrade semi-final of the Fide Grand Prix, as the Hungarian sprung the rare move 12 Rc3! which provoked errors by the Frenchman in his favourite Grünfeld Defence. Anish Giri (Netherlands) and Dmitry Andreikin (Russia) drew both their classical games and will play speed tie-breaks on Friday to decide who meets Rapport in the final. The groups for the third and final Grand Prix leg in Berlin have been announced, and include an unpleasant surprise for Hikaru Nakamura and Levon Aronian, who dominated the first leg in February.

3/11/2022,"Even in an era of professional tennis filled with athletes who can obliterate any ball off their groundstrokes from any part of the court, Jelena Ostapenko is unique. Her strength doesn’t simply lie in her power but the natural timing that allows her to change the direction of any speeding ball, the precision of her early, flat shots and, most importantly, her unrelenting belief that she must be in control of every point of every match. When in full flow and absurdly aiming for every line, she will find them. The clearest example of Ostapenko’s talents came in the biggest, most tense moment of her career, when aged 20 she marched into the 2017 French Open final before trailing Simona Halep 0-3 and facing three separate break points in the third set. With her back to the wall, Ostapenko swung and swung until she changed her own destiny, reeling off the final six games to win her first grand slam title. Having punched herself into a new existence as a grand slam champion with a target on her back and a high-risk style that is so hard to consistently maintain, a dip in Ostapenko’s form after her win was widely anticipated. While it did not come immediately, by 2019 Ostapenko had fallen as low as No 83 in the world. Some small positive runs followed, and occasionally enough shots landed in for a big win, but all too often Ostapenko would step into matches determined to hit her opponent off the court and self-sabotage with unforced errors in the process. As the great BNP Paribas Open begins in Indian Wells this week, however, Ostapenko arrives as one of the stories of the season. After being ranked outside the top 50 last year, she is now No 12, on the verge of returning to the top 10 and rising quickly. Since September she has pieced together one of the most consistent periods of her career, performing week after week and compiling a 23-8 record. While her gradual rise up the rankings initially flew somewhat under the radar, last month she burst back into the spotlight by embarking on a nine-match winning streak in the Middle East, winning the Dubai WTA 500 event before reaching the semi-final at the WTA 1000 in Doha. Across her nine wins, Ostapenko defeated six different grand slam champions: Sofia Kenin, Iga Swiatek, Petra Kvitova, Simona Halep, Barbora Krejcikova and Garbiñe Muguruza. For most big-hitting tennis players in a long slump, the route to sustained success is always said to be by playing more consistent, cerebral tennis, such as adding more top spin and tempering the urge to attack every shot. Ostapenko has certainly attempted to broaden her skill set at times, incorporating more drop shots and patience while echoing those sentiments in interviews. Yet as she discussed her revival in the Middle East last month, she had other ideas, instead doubling down on her need to lace every point with attacking play. “I was trying to be more accurate and just put the ball in play, which I shouldn’t,” she told WTA insider. “I should go for my shots and play my aggressive game. I felt like I have to be even more aggressive sometimes.” “Aggressive” is the most overused word in the sport, a sentiment that even some of the most defensive players on both tours use to describe their tactics, but Ostapenko’s commitment to attacking tennis runs deep. She believes that tennis should be played on the front foot, taking risks and controlling your own destiny, and she has frequently shown no respect for players who rather live off their consistency and their opponents’ errors. When she was younger, Ostapenko’s abhorrence of defensive opponents even extended to the best players in the world. When the 19-year-old Ostapenko played against the then No 4, Agnieszka Radwanska, in 2016, she spent her changeovers during the loss denigrating her opponent’s game to her coach and vowed never to play her again. “She doesn’t play at all,” said Ostapenko. “She plays like an amateur. Our amateurs play better in Latvia.” While Ostapenko refuses to temper her playing style, her revival has not merely been a consequence of hitting a purple patch. There have been only a few matches where her winners flowed freely, particularly when she dismantled Muguruza and Krejcikova in consecutive matches in Doha. Otherwise, she has dug out wins from dire positions, sometimes while playing far from her best tennis. In Dubai she played three brutal three-set matches in succession, against Swiatek, Kvitova and Halep, recovering from a set down in all and saving a match point against Kvitova. She showed that even with her low-percentage game, she can still give herself the best chance of success by controlling what she can control, remaining mentally present in every point, match and tournament, and not allowing her emotions to cloud her play. In the process she has found a rare period of consistency: since September she has lost only to current or former top 10 players in completed matches. This steadfast consistency will not hold forever; there will be plenty of volatility in Ostapenko’s results as long as she maintains her commitment to attacking at all costs, but she has put herself in the position to be a contender once moreand the top levels of her sport are enriched with her presence.",Sport/Sport,Jelena Ostapenko regains consistency without sacrificing attacking edge,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/jelena-ostapenko-regains-consistency-without-sacrificing-attacking-edge
3/11/2022,"Britain’s economy bounced back from the Omicron variant of coronavirus at a faster pace than expected during January, as consumers returned to eating and drinking out in pubs and restaurants. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said all sectors of the economy returned to growth, helping to lift gross domestic product by 0.8% in January from a month earlier, fuelled by a rise in consumer-facing services. GDP was estimated to be 0.8% above its pre-pandemic level, reflecting a weaker impact on the economy than expected after the emergence of the Omicron variant led to a sharp rise in coronavirus infections. City economists had forecast a slower growth rate of 0.2%. Darren Morgan, a director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: “All sectors grew in January, with some industries that were hit particularly hard in December now performing well, including wholesaling, retailing, restaurants and takeaways. Computer programming and film and television production also had a good start to the year. “While supply chain issues persisted in certain sectors, output in both construction and manufacturing grew for the third month running.” In a snapshot of the economy that was taken before the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed up already high energy prices to fresh record levels, the ONS said the main driver of growth in January was wholesale trade, which was up 3.8%, amid a bounceback after weakness in December because of the impact of Omicron. Activity in IT services such as computer programming and consultancy increased strongly in the month, as well as film, TV and sound recording and music publishing. Reflecting the return of consumers to pubs and restaurants, activity in the food and drink sector rose by 6.8%, after a fall of 8.1% in December when Omicron led to a wave of cancelled bookings for Christmas parties and gatherings. Despite the bounceback in January, experts warned that soaring energy prices since the invasion of Ukraine meant the UK was at increased risk of slipping into recession later this year. “The figures have been pushed into the rear-view mirror by renewed domestic and global shocks, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” said Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. “The UK’s economy could stall in the near term as rising inflation, soaring energy bills and higher taxes increasingly drag on activity despite a probable boost to output in February from the end of plan B Covid restrictions.”",News/Business,UK economy bounces back from Omicron as more people dine out,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/11/uk-economy-bounces-back-from-omicron-as-more-people-dine-out-gdp
3/11/2022,"Australia has joined major allies including the US and the UK and banned imports of Russian oil, but only after shipments already ordered and paid for arrive. While Australia is not a major importer of Russian energy products, the coordinated efforts “will collectively curtail Russia’s revenue and ability to finance Russian president Vladimir Putin’s unjustified war against Ukraine”, a spokesperson for the foreign minister, Marise Payne, said on Friday afternoon. With petrol prices soaring past $2 a litre in major cities, the government was keen to stress the decision did not risk Australia’s fuel security. “Australia has diverse and resilient oil supply chains, and adequate fuel supplies,” the spokesperson said, adding the government was “closely monitoring global oil and energy markets and are working with our allies and the International Energy Agency to ensure ongoing supply security”. The government will not impose the ban – which covers crude, refined petroleum products, gas and coal – for 45 days. That delay would allow the two main local refiners Viva Energy and Ampol to take deliveries of Russian crude that had already been ordered and paid for. Both Viva Energy and Ampol said earlier this week they had bought two Russian-origin crude cargoes prior to the conflict. The shipments were due to arrive in Australia over the next two months. The companies declined to say whether the cargoes were being shared, or if there were four in total. Guardian Australia also sought a response about the ban on imports. Viva Energy said it was “appalled by events unfolding in Ukraine and extends its sympathies to the innocent people affected by this terrible conflict”, and that it had stopping buying Russian crude. “Viva Energy has explored options to dispose of these cargoes, but there are no credible purchasers in the current market and without these supplies the company faces gaps in its refining program and potential fuel shortages,” a Viva spokesperson said prior to the government’s announcement. “These cargoes have been purchased from international oil companies, rather than from Russian entities.” Ampol said it condemned Russia’s actions in Ukraine, and supported international efforts “against Russia in support of Ukraine and its people”. It too had ceased buying Russian crude oil or products since the conflict began, and “will not enter into any further contracts”. Ampol said it had two Russian cargoes “in our current planned supply chains” that would be “discharged” by the end of April. The firm’s Lytton refinery in Brisbane typically sourced crude from south-east Asia, Africa, North America and the Middle East, the company said in a statement. The government spokesperson said Australia strongly supported earlier announcements by the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, that they would impose a ban. “We will continue to coordinate closely with these and other partners to impose the highest economic costs on Russia for its actions, including by continuing to review our sanctions and expand them where appropriate,” the spokesperson said. According to government statistics, Australia last year imported 147 megalitres of crude from Russia, or just 1.2% of total oil imports at a cost of $73.9m.

Australian taxpayers are already supporting the refiners, with the government last year saying it would pay $2bn over a decade to keep refinery capacity in the country to ensure some local supplies.",News/Australia news,Australia to join US and UK in banning Russian oil imports,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/australia-to-join-us-and-uk-in-banning-russian-oil-imports
3/11/2022,"The families of Kumanjayi Walker have had to hold back their feelings from public view for more than two years. So when they were finally able to speak, on the steps of the Northern Territory supreme court on Friday, their grief and disappointment overwhelmed the carefully worded statements they had prepared. A jury acquitted police officer Zachary Rolfe of murder on Friday over the 2019 shooting of Walker in Yuendumu. The court heard Walker was shot three times, with Rolfe arguing he acted to protect his and his partner’s safety. Ned Jampinjinpa Hargreaves, a Warlpiri elder, was in tears when he spoke outside court after the verdict. “When are we going to get justice?” he cried. “When?” Hargreaves called for an end to guns in rural communities. “Karrinjarla muwajarri. No guns! No guns in the rural remote community! Enough is enough! It’s gotta stop. “To our people – let us stand strong. Let us respect each other. And we do not want to see another black young fella, or a girl, to be shot.” Warren Williams then spoke, reminding the media and onlookers outside the court in Darwin that they were all on Aboriginal land, and that there was a need to show respect for that fact. “We are the custodians of this land, of this community called Australia. We need to be recognised as true owners of this land. We need to have control of our lives. We have our own yapa system in our culture, in our law.” Walker’s families have worked hard to keep a lid on any commentary over the past two years, regularly reminding followers and supporters not to say anything on social media that could interfere with a fair trial. Their young leaders have worked as media managers, providing clarity and assistance, speaking with dignity and respecting the wishes of their elders. They showed an incredible capacity to stay calm and focused. The last and youngest of the family to speak, Samara Fernandez Brown, wept as she spoke of five exhausting weeks at the trial. She wanted to remind everyone of Walker’s humanity. She said he was a “joyful and generous” young man who “loved animals, loved his family, who loved his partner, his friends, his homelands, who loved music”. “A young man who was taken far too soon, and a young man who will be deeply, deeply missed,” Fernandez Brown said. “Kumanjayi was only 19 years old when he died at the police station of Yuendumu after being shot three times by Zachary Rolfe. That is a fact. That cannot be disputed.” “He died without his family’s support, even though we stood just outside, begging to come in to see if he was OK. He was rejected the opportunity to be comforted in his last moments, and we were robbed of the opportunity to say goodbye to him. “Sometimes I think about how he must have felt in his last moments. Was he scared? Terrified, I’d imagine. Was he in pain? Excruciating pain, I would think. And he was alone. His death has affected our community and our family in ways that we can’t describe. We are all in so much pain.” For the families of Walker and for Warlpiri people of Yuendumu, this case has brought back memories of the past. This was the first time a police officer was brought to trial for a shooting at Yuendumu, but they remember all the times when police acted with impunity along the colonial frontier. The most recent mass killing of Warlpiri people happened at Coniston in 1928, when a police constable, George Murray, led a group of men on horseback who shot and killed more than 50 men, women and children at at least six sites. Warlpiri, Anmatyerre and Kaytetye people say up to 170 died. When Warlpiri elders talk about wanting “no more guns”, they are referring to that history. Fernandez Brown said there will now be a period of grieving for a life lost and for a reach towards justice, which for them has fallen far too short. “We are deeply disappointed and, though we’ve been given a trial, I can’t, with honesty, say that it’s been fair ... We will return home and continue our healing process, but this is not the last you will hear from Kumanjayi Walker’s family,” Fernandez Brown said. The next step will be a coronial inquest, which will examine the details of what happened after the shooting, when police took Walker into the station and the families waited outside for hours for news of his condition. “This is not the end of his story. This is not the end of our fight, after some rest we will turn our attention to the coronial inquest where we hope our truth and our questions will finally come. To ensure no other family will go through what we have endured over the past two years,” Fernandez Brown said.",News/Australia news,‘We are all in so much pain’: Kumanjayi Walker family’s call for end to police guns has a long history,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/we-are-all-in-so-much-pain-kumanjayi-walker-familys-call-for-end-to-police-guns-has-a-long-history
