4/14/2022,"(Reuters) - Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered in the besieged port city of Mariupol and urged remaining forces holed up in the Azovstal steel mill to surrender. There was no comment from Ukrainian officials on the statement made on Kadyrov's Telegram channel. Ukraine's General Staff, in its morning report on Wednesday, said that Russian forces were proceeding with attacks on Azovstal and the port. Russian television showed pictures of what it said were marines giving themselves up at Illich Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol on Tuesday, many of them injured. It was not clear what plant - Azovstal or Illich Iron and Steel Works - Kadyrov meant when he talked about the 1,000 surrendered Ukrainian marines. ""Within Azovstal at the moment there are about 200 wounded who cannot receive any medical assistance,"" Kadyrov said in his post. ""For them and all the rest it would be better to end this pointless resistance and go home to their families."" Kadyrov is an ardent supporter of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin and has deployed many of his fighters in Ukraine to bolster Russia's drive to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" Ukraine. In earlier postings, he vowed to proceed with the capture of Mariupol and to press on to take all other Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv Russian television pictures showed what it said were Ukrainian soldiers being marched down a road with their hands in the air. One of the soldiers was shown holding a Ukrainian passport.

4/14/2022,"Men should pay on first dates to check if their date is ""entitled,"" divorce lawyer Justin Lee said. It's the ""best litmus test"" for a partner, the Toronto-based family lawyer said on TikTok. The video sparked debate on dating etiquette and who should pay for dates. Men should always pay on first dates — but not for the reasons you might think. At least that's according to one Toronto-based divorce lawyer who think paying for dates is the perfect litmus test. ""The issue isn't tied to the number of dollars that we're spending at the end of the date,"" divorce lawyer Justin Lee said in a TikTok video that has more than 342,000 views. ""The issue is when we end up paying for someone who has this real sense of entitlement, like this expectation that we will pay. That's precisely why we need to always pay."" It's the ""best litmus test,"" he described in the caption. ""Your date, whoever that is, may very well be the person you end up marrying. And trust me when I say, as a divorce lawyer, who you end up marrying is so, so important,"" he continued in the video. ""Let's say, at the end of the date, you pull out your wallet and you offer to pay. And your date just sits there, expecting you to pay, as if that is the obvious course of action,"" he said. ""You just learned that the person in front of you is entitled, and frankly, has the audacity to expect a near stranger to pay for them. Just imagine how someone like that would treat their significant other."" He added: ""For a low, low price of $20, $30, $40, you learned that the person in front of you does not have the basic courtesy to pretend to offer to pay. And therefore you should never go on another date with them."" Lee, who has 175,800 followers on TikTok, is a family law attorney working at McCarthy Hansen & Company in Toronto, Canada. He did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The video sparked discussions on dating etiquette, with some users saying that the person who asks for the date should be expected to pay. ""Counterpoint — for a first date, usually the woman has invested far more money (and time) into clothes, hair, makeup, etc — everything a man expects,"" a user wrote in a comment that got more than 1,600 likes. In the comments, Lee stressed that men will ""gladly pay"" because ""the payment isn't the issue."" ""The issue is when women perceive the payment as an obligation as opposed to a kind gesture. Entitled vs. appreciative. No one owes anybody anything!"" he wrote. ""For the record, this isn't gender specific — any man or woman who feels entitled in any way towards the other is a walking red flag,"" he added.

4/14/2022,"(Recasts headline and lead) LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland joined the U.S.-led military alliance then Russia would have to bolster its defences in the region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, and Sweden are mulling whether or not to join the NATO alliance. Finland will make a decision in the next few weeks, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that should Sweden and Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea to restore military balance. Medvedev also explicitly raised the nuclear threat by saying that there could be no more talk of a ""nuclear free"" Baltic - where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. ""There can be no more talk of any nuclear–free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored,"" said Medvedev, who was president from 2008-2012. ""Until today, Russia has not taken such measures and was not going to,"" Medvedev said. ""If our hand is forced well... take note it wasn't us who proposed this,"" he added. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine. Ukraine says it is fighting against an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense.
