2/5/2022,"The wry observation – no joke given the seriousness of the material – that the Royal Opera’s new staging of Theodora failed to deliver the sex and violence promised may have worn thin by the time you read this. All to the good. Katie Mitchell’s take on Handel’s late oratorio, first performed in London in 1750, is far superior to the blizzard of warning signals that preceded it, and far less radical too. Most of the advance alerts were irrelevant for anyone with even mildly robust 21st-century sensibilities. This tragedy of a virginal Christian woman persecuted by the Romans, set to an English libretto by Thomas Morell, contains some of the most affecting and inward-looking music Handel wrote. Therein lies the shock: that his economy of means could produce music of such grief. Mitchell’s updating honoured that solemnity, as did the star cast led by the soprano Julia Bullock as Theodora, the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato as her friend Irene, and the countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński as the Christian convert Didymus.  You can take or leave the directorial interventions, the hallmark slo-mo sequences, the gun-toting and bomb-making. So, too, can you accept the shift in narrative emphasis: Mitchell wants this religion to be active and political rather than, as she sees it, passive, though we could argue at length about whether an interior faith can ever truly be passive. None of her interpretation, thoughtfully conveyed on its own terms, obscures the work’s simple message – a cry for tolerance urged at the outset by Didymus: “vain is the attempt to force belief/ with the severest instrument of death”. Handel asks the same question with equal force in Messiah: “Why do the nations so furiously rage together”. Humanity wins out in Theodora. Neither the misogyny Mitchell finds in the work, nor the rescue from it by a feminist interpretation and a reworked and unconvincing ending, can alter that central plea. Conducted by Harry Bicket, whose familiarity with Theodora goes back to Peter Sellars’s Glyndebourne production of the 1990s, when Bicket played harpsichord continuo, the music took time to settle, with nervous scrambling between pit and stage at the start. Yet during the course of this four-hour evening, Handel’s genius shone with ever greater luminosity, supported by a staging of care, perception and mostly – a second encounter is needed to understand every aspect – coherence. Designed with stylish attention to detail by Chloe Lamford, with costumes by Sussie Juhlin-Wallén and lighting by James Farncombe, the setting is a modern embassy. The covert Christians work in a catering kitchen, in service to the Romans who hold champagne parties next door, both rooms visible at once in the sliding-boxes set. Bullock’s Theodora, heartfelt and strong, is ardently sung by this versatile performer. Handel may not be her central musical territory, but she gave it her all, with nuance and vitality. The role of Irene, taken by DiDonato, has greater dramatic scope and matchless arias (including As with rosy steps the morn). DiDonato and Bicket together showed how Handel’s long da capo arias – in which the first section returns after a contrasting middle – move forwards not back, not a repetition but an emotional transfiguration. They did this via ornamentation and dynamics, subtle in execution, absolute in impact. DiDonato, whether pushing her Dinnerladies cleaning trolley or spooning out instant coffee as if for a homely prayer meeting, electrified, especially in Lord, to thee. (Asserting my non-passive self, I would happily thwack the person who shouted “Brava!”, fortissimo solo, each time DiDonato finished singing.) The production’s dominant visual image, gallingly, will be that of the two near-naked pole dancers who spiral up and down in their red padded velvet boudoir like birds of paradise. They do this, nearly to distraction, in Theodora’s sorrowing aria, With darkness deep, underlining the disparity between the dancers’ pride in their work and the Christian virgin’s horror at her enforced prostitution. Yet they can coexist, and offer mutual solace. Crass humour is narrowly avoided when Didymus, now disguised in Theodora’s short, tight, sequined sex worker garb, takes over on the pole. Orliński, singing with limpid clarity in a striking house debut, is also a brave and game actor. This episode is merely the most titivating part of a rich visual whole that offers so much more. Ed Lyon as the conflicted Septimius (triumphing in From virtue springs each gen’rous deed), Gyula Ordent as Valens and Thando Mjandana as Marcus completed the lineup. The orchestra sounded more meaty than we are now used to in baroque repertoire, but still lithe and responsive. Five-star praise to the ROH chorus, and to the basso continuo players, the linchpin of this music, who give colour and character: harpsichordists Andrew Griffiths and Mark Packwood, cellist Chris Vanderspar and, especially, theorbo player Eligio Luis Quinteiro, sinewy and sensuous throughout. Handel’s contemporary Bach may never have written any operas, but his conservative employers in Leipzig, on his appointment as cantor, warned him against being too operatic. One of his cantatas from that period, Jesus schläft, was soll ich hoffen?, BWV 81 (Jesus sleeps, what should my hope be?) uses expressive colouring, whether in the drifts of woodwind that suggest slumber in the opening alto aria, or in the bursting storm music that follows. Dramatic? Without question. This was the work featured in the latest Bach, the Universe and Everything by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, an ongoing Sunday series performed on the same day at Kings Place, London and Oxford Mathematical Institute. Directing from the organ, Steven Devine led eight singers and nine instrumentalists in a taut programme of short works with the cantata as centrepiece. Bethany Horak-Hallett, a member of the OAE’s Rising Stars of the Enlightenment scheme, sang the opening aria with persuasive freshness and assurance. A feature of these events is the choice of a science-connected speaker to give a “sermon”. Tim Harford, economist, journalist and wonderful presenter of BBC Radio 4’s More or Less, spoke fluently about how random obstacles can inspire us to be more creative. His central example was Keith Jarrett’s Köln concert, when a bad back and a bad piano nearly forced the jazz master to cancel, but resulted in a bestselling album of improvised brilliance. We should all bear that in mind as we embrace our current chaoses – and yes, let’s put that in the plural.

2/5/2022,"Any hope of the controversies that have dogged the Beijing Winter Games fading into a feelgood blur of medals once the torch was lit was quickly swept aside on Saturday as the first gold of these Olympics went to a convicted doper. Therese Johaug, the decorated Norwegian cross-country skier who was barred from competing at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics while serving an 18-month suspension for a positive drugs test she blamed on tainted lip balm, obliterated the field to win the 7.5km+7.5km skiathlon on a windblown afternoon in the tiny village of Taizicheng in the mountains roughly 120km northwest of Beijing.  Few if any of the 109 gold medals that will be handed out across 15 different sports over the next two and a half weeks will be won in more dominant fashion. The 33-year-old Johaug, who tucked herself into the leading pack from the mass start before opening a lead of nearly a minute on a chase group of four during the final lap, raised her arms in jubilation as she crossed the line in a time of 44min 13.7sec to win the 15km contest regarded as cross-country’s ultimate test. Natalia Nepryaeva, the Russian perched atop the overall World Cup leaderboard, rallied to overtake a pair of skiers in the final kilometre to win the silver, coming in 30.2sec off the pace. Austria’s Teresa Stadlober settled for bronze after she was pipped by 0.3sec at the finish by Nepryaeva. Kerttu Niskanen of Finland finished fourth and Frida Karlsson of Sweden was fifth, eight seconds ahead of sixth-place Jessie Diggins, who became the first American to win a gold medal in cross-country in the team sprint at Pyeongchang. The skiathlon race is designed to determine the best all-around skier. That mantle belongs to Johaug after her runaway victory, which played out in punishing conditions of icy gusts and -1C (30F) temperatures, but not without the spectre of controversy. For Johaug, it was her fourth career Olympic medal and second gold after helping Norway to a 4×5km relay win at the 2010 Vancouver Games. The 14-times world champion also won a silver and bronze in team events at Sochi four years later. But the Norwegian was forced out of the 2018 Olympics due a lengthy suspension after testing positive for the anabolic steroid clostebol, which she claimed was the result of a lip ointment purchased by team doctor Fredrik Bendiksen on short notice to treat sunburn during high-altitude training in Italy. Her explanation was deemed implausible by skiing’s international governing body – not least because the cream in question included a doping warning label on the box – which appealed the 13-month suspension initially handed down by Norwegian anti-doping authorities. The court of arbitration forsport subsequently tacked on five months to the punishment, acknowledging Johaug’s “otherwise clean anti-doping record” but citing her negligence in missing a clear warning label and ruling one of the sport’s biggest stars out of Pyeongchang. “Johaug failed to conduct a basic check of the packaging, which not only listed a prohibited substance as an ingredient but also included a clear doping cautionary warning,” the court said in a press release. Bendiksen went on to resign his post after taking the blame for Johaug’s positive test. Since returning from her suspension, Johaug has finished off the podium just once in 53 races. She is widely expected to add to her medal haul in the coming days as the women’s cross-country programme moves forward. “It means a lot,” Johaug said in the immediate aftermath. “I’ve never had an [individual] Olympic gold medal, it’s my first one. I’m so happy.” She added: “At first I was really happy just to come here because we have the Covid in our team. And today when I’m reaching my goal, I’m so happy. I’ve trained thousands of hours for this and been away from home a lot over the years. So it’s beautiful to reach this goal.” Johaug’s win came shortly before speed skater Irene Schouten of the Netherlands won the second gold of the Beijing Games in the women’s 3000m.",Sport/Sport,Beijing 2022’s first gold medal won by convicted doper Therese Johaug ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/beijing-2022s-first-gold-medal-won-by-convicted-doper-therese-johaug
2/5/2022,"Nottingham Forest proved the progress they are making as a club in January. For many the victories over Arsenal and arch-rivals Derby were the biggest moments, but for others getting expensive flops off the books and not overpaying in the market were significant. The departures of Carl Jenkinson and Lyle Taylor, among others, take the club one step closer to escaping the previous era of excess, when players were signed on inflated wages in the hope of securing a return to the Premier League. In recent years many shortsighted incomings have not lived up to their billing, leaving Forest, who face Leicester in the FA Cup on Sunday, losing money without the reward of promotion.  Jenkinson, for example, joined in summer 2019 but played 11 games in two and a half years. Taylor, who was earning more than £30,000 a week, has left on loan after scoring eight times in 60 appearances since signing a three-year deal aged 30, a further sign of financial exuberance. Forest’s latest accounts showed a £32m operating loss for the year ending March 2020, a sign things needed to change. Dane Murphy arrived last year from Barnsley to become the chief executive and a new statistics-led recruitment team was installed with a remit to lower the cost and average age of the squad. Murphy plays a key role in recruitment, offering a different perspective as someone who played professionally in the United States and Germany. Fifteen first-team players have left on permanent or loan deals since the end of last season, and summer recruits had to be 26 or younger and cost less than £10,000 a week. This season’s departures have reduced the average age and saved millions in wages. Despite the optimism that the squad was capable of promotion, things started badly under Chris Hughton, six defeats in their first seven matches leaving them bottom with one point when the manager was sacked in September. The former Swansea head coach Steve Cooper arrived to galvanise a squad low on confidence. Cooper was Forest’s first choice thanks to his work improving young players at Liverpool and Swansea and within the England setup. He has made the players believe in themselves and they have dragged themselves into play-off contention with 12 wins in his opening 22 games. The game which pushed the two-times European Cup winners back into the limelight was their FA Cup third-round win over Arsenal. Smart recruitment was plain as Djed Spence, on loan from Middlesbrough, was a standout performer at right-back, leading to interest from numerous Premier League clubs. In front of him was the academy graduate Brennan Johnson, who was then the subject of recording-breaking bids from Brentford. Spence was not wanted by Neil Warnock at the Riverside and Hughton was keen to loan Johnson for a season in League One to aid his experience but both have flourished in the Championship. It is a sign of progress on and off the pitch that Forest felt able to reject the money on offer for Johnson because they did not want to damage a squad on the up. Cooper’s success has quickly earned him the respect of the Greek owners, who sanctioned the signing of Steve Cook from Bournemouth on a deal running to 2024 even though the centre-back is 30. Cook is seen by Cooper as the experienced player who can help coach his young side through games as they look to secure promotion. Cooper and the recruitment team operate in tandem. On deadline day they missed out on the wingers Jed Wallace and Josh Bowler because of Millwall’s and Blackpool’s valuations. Previously, Forest might have panicked and paid up for players but the regime held firm to avoid overpaying. Instead they moved for Sam Surridge to cover for the injured Lewis Grabban and the defender Jonathan Panzo joined from Dijon, both within the business model. The net has been spread far to find bargains. Forest targeted Benfica’s Gonçalo Ramos and Internazionale’s Martín Satriano in January, and Richie Laryea arrived from Toronto FC. They have been smart in the loan market, bringing in Spence, Max Lowe, Philip Zinckernagel and the returning James Garner in the summer, and in January adding Keinan Davis, who would have joined before the season started but for injury. In the long term the club would like to move away from having so many loan players. Leicester, the next Premier League side to be tested by this evolving team, won the top flight thanks to careful scouting and management, making them a role model for Forest. If promotion does not come this season, it would not be the crushing blow it was previously. Instead Forest would go into next season with a platform to build on, rather than making the wholesale changes that have become tradition at the City Ground.",Sport/Football, Steve Cooper trims dead wood to put Nottingham Forest on solid ground | Will Unwin,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/steve-cooper-nottingham-forest-fa-cup-leicester
2/5/2022,"At the height of the tense second phase of the cold war, a group of Stasi majors, propaganda officers and border guards convened at a heavily fortified compound in socialist east Berlin. From spring 1982 until winter 1989, they gathered once every four weeks, from 4pm until 6pm, at the House of Culture inside the premises of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment (the Stasi’s paramilitary wing), in Berlin’s Adlershof district. They met in a first-floor room adorned with portraits of East German leader Erich Honecker and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin that was closed with a security seal overnight. But the Stasi men did not gather to gameplan nuclear war scenarios, work up disinformation campaigns or fine-tune infiltration techniques. They set out to learn about iambic pentameter, cross-rhyming schemes and Petrarchan sonnets. The group, which internal memos referred to as the Working Circle of Writing Chekists (a reference to the fearsome Bolshevist secret police, the Cheka), produced two anthologies over this seven-year period. I got hold of a copy of one shortly before I moved to Berlin in 2016. The slim paperback, its title Wir Über Uns (“We about us”) falling down the front page in curling calligraphic letters, felt like something out of a Monty Python sketch, or a spin-off from the film The Lives of Others. How had a secret police synonymous with the suppression of free thought ended up writing poetry? Over the coming months I tried to track down former members of the circles, and contacted them to see if they could tell me more.  The first Writing Chekist to reply was Jürgen Polinske, a former border guard who now worked as an archivist at Berlin’s Humboldt University. He was happy to meet up, he wrote in an email, but “how much time we will need will depend on your questions”. We met at a restaurant under the railway arches in Berlin’s Mitte district, just down the road from Friedrichstrasse station where he used to wave people across the iron curtain. What had the Stasi tried to achieve with its poetry programme, I asked Polinske over a currywurst with potato salad. Was the idea to help East Germany’s working-class warriors better understand the decadent bourgeois mind? Polinske shook his head. The reason he had joined the Stasi poetry circle was simple: “I had artistic ambitions, and I thought I could learn something from the real poets who ran the workshop.” His own poems were technically accomplished, but could verge on the whimsical, and didn’t always earn praise. Many of the young soldiers who turned up to the Working Circle of Writing Chekists had left with tears in their eyes after being informed of the poor quality of their work. He, too, had stopped attending after a few months. If I really wanted to understand why the Stasi had set up the circle and how they planned to use it, Polinske said, I should try to contact the circle’s former artistic leader, a thin man with thick glasses called Uwe Berger. He had instilled the group with a dogma: poetry had to rouse emotion and boost the hunger for victory in class warfare. I paid our bill. Outside the cafe, before we waved our goodbyes, Polinske said something that I couldn’t quite make sense of at the time: “The question mark at the end of a poem is worth a hundred times more than a full stop. I know that now, after thinking about it for a long time. But I didn’t know that then.” In theory, there is nothing surprising about the East German politburo declaring a matter of statecraft the vaguest of all literary disciplines, what Edmund Burke once called the “art of substantiating shadows, and of lending existence to nothing”. In the 1970s, the East German government had warned that the relatively small number of readers of schöne literatur, or high literature, represented a “key problem” for the socialist country. A mere 35% of the adult population reading Goethe and Pushkin was deemed insufficient: in East Germany, that number was to rise to 90%, and ideally within five years. A 1973 decree prescribed that larger East German factories must have an on-site library with 500 to 1,000 books, staffed by a librarian. Bigger factories needed more books, 18,000-30,000, in any enterprise employing between 5,000 and 10,000 employees. In terms of books printed, the stated aim was a yearly increase in productivity of 4-5%. Between 1950 and 1989, the number of books printed each year and the proportion of those that were fiction more than tripled. An International Study of Reading Literacy, conceived before the fall of the Wall but carried out just after, found that “the average reading comprehension of East German eighth-graders was significantly higher than that of their West German contemporaries”. The poetic and political destiny of East Germany were intertwined: that had been the credo of an influential group of poets who had returned from exile after the second world war to take up political posts in the fledgling satellite state of Soviet Russia. One of them, poet-turned-culture-minister Johannes R Becher, argued that creative writing would not merely reflect the social conditions of East Germany, but shape them. This utopian vision would rattle around policymakers’ heads even after Becher’s death in 1958. A year later, the Socialist Unity party launched a programme designed to bridge the divide between the working classes and the intelligentsia: writers would be made to work in factories or coalmines, where they would teach their craft to their comrades in so-called Circles of Writing Workers. Within a few years, every branch of industry had its own writers’ circle: train carriage construction workers, chemists, teachers. East Germany’s secret police did not wait long to get in on the act. The first passing references to Writing Chekists in the Ministry for State Security appear in the files as early as 1960. In 1961, the Stasi’s administrative branch in Berlin records a second “lyrical evening”, attended by three of its full-time employees. But the intelligence agency’s dedication to lyrical praxis would remain sporadic for the next two decades. The Stasi major who ran the informal poetry meet-ups at the Adlershof compound in the late 70s had an inexhaustible appetite for jaunty ditties (“This song is very popular / In our country the GDR” went one), and the poems produced by his students were often similarly lighthearted. Soldiers in their late teens penned love poetry that paid little attention to political debates. One young member of the secret police fantasised in free verse about being kissed by a young maiden who was unaware of his lowly rank, thus elevating him to a “lance corporal of love”. “Patiently I wait”, the lusty teenager wrote, “for my next promotion / at least / to general”. One soldier imagined, in a sestina, writing the words “I love you” into the dark night sky with his searchlight. “An egotist / in love I am”, went another verse. “Want you / to be mine / just mine / and hope never / to be nationalised”. Love poetry could be awkwardly at odds with a state that valued collective ownership over private property. For reasons that are not explicitly spelled out in the paperwork that survives in the Stasi records archive, East Germany’s Ministry for State Security decided in spring 1982 that it needed to professionalise its poetry circle. It put out feelers to Uwe Berger, a prize-winning poet with an impressive 20 anthologies and novels under his belt. Berger seemed a strange choice for such a mission. Born in 1928, he had been one of about 200,000 teenagers who were drafted into the Luftwaffe in the dying days of the Third Reich as auxiliary staff, or Flakhelfer: a traumatic experience that seemed to have made him unable to later join the rank and file of party politics. Unusually, and unlike roughly every sixth East German citizen over the age of 18 at around that time, the 54-year-old was not a member of the ruling Socialist Unity party – an organisation that saw itself not as a political party in the conventional sense but an “avant garde of the proletariat” that existed beyond all checks and balances, commanding authority over the judiciary, executive and legislative. Berger had died in a Berlin hospital in September 2014, but contemporaries I spoke to recalled an almost monkish ascetic, a man whose most extravagant hobby outside writing was a collection of rocks and minerals he had picked up on travels around the Soviet bloc. One poet published by the same imprint said their mutual editor, who used to visit Berger in his apartment every Christmas, had realised one year that the glass of schnapps they drank together always came from the same bottle on his kitchen shelf: in the 12 months between their meetings, Berger would not take so much as a sip. A Berliner Zeitung profile from August 1965 portrayed Berger as a “lone wolf”, who “did not find or seek a connection”. Nonetheless, he accepted the invitation to run the Stasi poetry circle. Under Berger’s tutelage, a new discipline descended. Young soldiers who were doing their three-year military service in the Guards Regiment had to wear their uniforms; officers could attend in civilian clothing. Lessons had a clearer structure. Members of the programme were required to take turns reading out their poems and Berger would encourage feedback. Only once this discussion had finished did he himself comment, always in a polite voice, rarely overtly critical. The poems produced in the Stasi’s creative writing class became less frivolous. The utopian underpinning of socialist East Germany faded into the distance. One 32-year-old with a strong stutter, a second lieutenant in the Stasi’s central information service, read out a poem called Dialectics: “Then / at the shooting range / I take aim with calm / and precision”. Poetry, one of the circle’s other members I tracked down told me, was the sound of a little bird, singing. But Berger didn’t want to hear birdsong, “he wanted every poem to sound like The Internationale”. The group’s new syllabus leaned more heavily on a phrase coined by the poet-turned-GDR-diplomat Friedrich Wolf (father of Markus, one of the most well-known spymasters of the cold war): art is a weapon. “The material of our age lies in front of us, hard as iron”, Wolf had written in a 1928 poem. “Poets are working to forge it into a weapon. The worker has to pick up this weapon.” Working my way through piles of paperwork in the Stasi records archive, I discovered hundreds of poems that were produced by the Working Circle of Writing Chekists, including those that weren’t included in the secret police’s official anthologies. What became increasingly clear was that not all the young men who gathered at Adlershof once a week wanted to write weapons in verse form. They wanted to write poems that did something poetry was good at: asking questions rather than giving answers. In none of the poems was this tendency more pronounced than in those of 18-year-old soldier Alexander Ruika, one of the few members of the circle with a genuinely interesting way with words. The Guards Regiment was not just an ordinary unit where East German teens could while away their military service. It was an elite training ground from which the Stasi would frequently recruit new talent for special missions, such as the “tunnel unit” that was tasked with preventing underground escapes to the west. But Ruika’s poems voiced existential fears about life as a full-time spy. “Every human / has a craving / for disguise”, he conceded in Masks. The hunter’s instinct may even be a “habit from pre-human times”. But to him, “pretending to be someone else” looked like “courting behaviour / play acting”. His generation had been offered a chance to do things differently, Ruika wrote, to have the “courage to disrobe”: Away with the masksthe world of humans no longer a hunting groundadmit you are yourselfaccept yourselfand your neighbour too. The more the Stasi tried to weaponise poetry, the more it seemed to backfire. As tensions between east and west began to rise, the poems produced in the circle became ways of expressing what the East German regime deemed unsayable. In November 1983, the West German Bundestag voted to allow the US to station Pershing II and Tomahawk cruise missiles in southern Germany. Soviet leaders walked out of nuclear arms talks a day later. All the most dangerous pieces in a giant game of cold war missile chess were pointing at Berlin. East Germany was insistent on not showing any weakness in this cold war game of chicken, with state leader Honecker in denial about the existence of a growing youth peace movement. But even within the Stasi, fear of nuclear war accentuated a generational divide. In June 1984, a junior officer within the Stasi’s propaganda unit, called Gerd Knauer, presented the circle with a 52-page poem called The Bang. At the top of page three, there’s a noise as loud “as a thunderclap”, followed by a blinding white light, “daggers stabbing into your pupils”. Something is wrong, the narrator realises: the world is “hovering / on a precipice”. Knauer poured forth feelings he wasn’t usually allowed to express to his comrades. Across two full pages, he described “the fear / that everything might end”, “fear / of the explosions”, “fear that something – by mistake – / will not go to plan”. Locked into an ABAB rhyme scheme, the poem picks up pace, jumping from the personal to the political, the political to the biblical, the biblical to the mythical. By page 10, the poem is narrated by Odysseus, running in terror through “the fog of history”. Hounded by rolling thunder, Odysseus flees into an ivory tower where the philosophers live, seeking spiritual guidance in this hour of need. But Plato, Hegel and Kant all remain silent. Only a man with a bushy beard rises from his seat with an apologetic look on his face: Karl Marx tries to make a pleaLooks Odysseus in the faceSays gravely: They’re doing it because of meBut they put their faith in the wrong place. By page 13, the narrator, who at this stage may or may not be Odysseus, is stumbling across a hellscape strewn with dead bodies, “some naked others wearing clothes / Some sliced right open from head to toes”. On the poem’s final pages, the narrator joins a community of nuclear war survivors, disfigured men and women who live off stews made of bugs and flies. When Knauer finished reading it to the circle, he told me over lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant in Marzahn in 2019, there was a moment of silence. An ashen-faced kitchen worker, who had joined the group for the first time that day, rushed to the toilet. All the remaining eyes in the room were on the circle’s artistic leader. Uwe Berger said the poem was very technically advanced, and he was impressed with the skills the Chekists had acquired. What the Stasi officers didn’t know was that Berger had a relationship with the secret police that predated his deployment to the Adlershof compound. One summer morning in 2020, an archivist placed a weighty file on my reading-room desk at the Stasi Records Agency: marked “IM Uwe”, it consisted of six volumes held in faded brick-red cardboard folders, each holding approximately 350 pages. They dated back to November 1969, when the Stasi first approached Berger about working as an informal collaborator. Over a period of 12 years, the poet without party membership had proved himself to be one of the most productive informants on East Germany’s literary scene. Berger borrowed friends’ unpublished manuscripts to report on their political leanings, or just to comment on them “being a bit senile”. He informed the Stasi which of his literary colleagues was suspected of having an affair with whom, which jokes they told and which western TV programmes they allowed their children to watch (a Tarzan film merited particular disapproval). Berger’s activity as an informant enabled him to punish enemies, sideline rivals and build up allies, all with the stroke of a pen. In his reports, he eventually made a habit of referring to himself in the third person, as if he were writing small dramas with himself as the protagonist: “Uwe Berger said”; “Uwe Berger rejected this”. He described one writer with surrealist tendencies as having a “fascistoid fondness for intoxication and magic”, while denouncing another for making “the absurd accusation that we have fascists over here [in East Germany]”. In one case he even volunteered to suggest a put-down that the Stasi could place in book reviews of a female singer-songwriter he deemed insufficiently loyal to the state (his humble proposal: “tampon poetry”). In February 1982, the Stasi rewarded Berger for his enthusiastic service by handing him the silver Brotherhood in Arms medal, a military honour that the Ministry for State Security would only occasionally grant to individuals outside the armed forces. Berger does not mention the medal in a memoir he self-published after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The book makes his collaboration with the secret police sound like a tiresome chore, and rather short-lived. “A couple of years” after starting to write reports, Berger recalls, he asked his handler to release him from his commitment. As an artist, he reasoned, he could not be constantly exposed to the “negative aspects of life”. From reading Berger’s memoirs, you would assume that his appointment as poet-in-chief at Adlershof in 1982 was when his career as a spy came to an end. But the Stasi wasn’t just gathering information on civilians. It was, especially in the 1980s, also looking in on itself. When the Ministry for State Security was set up in 1950, it had recruited predominantly those from underprivileged, proletarian backgrounds. But in the 1970s a growth spurt made it harder to stick to its founding principles. The Stasi had 20,000 employees in 1961, when the Wall was built; by 1982, its ranks had swelled fourfold, to 81,500. Many were the sons of Stasi officers, and thus only “working class” by a rhetorical sleight of hand. “The candidate comes from a progressive family loyal to the party of the working class” is a phrase that pops up regularly in the Stasi’s recruitment files from that period. Could this new generation be trusted? In Berlin, staff were housed in self-contained districts, which were managed by an internal administrative unit. Stasi officers were looked after in Stasi hospitals, their children went to Stasi nurseries or Stasi schools: a privilege, but also a sign of the lengths to which the state was going in order to maintain complete control. The officers themselves were made to share offices, so that comrade would always keep an eye on comrade. But what about the moment they left their desks? The Stasi needed someone to watch the watchers when they let their guards down. It had to find a method to gaze into their hearts to identify any desires that could grow into a temptation, to X-ray their souls for deviant fears and aspirations. It had a job for Uwe Berger. As the Stasi men at the Adlershof House of Culture became increasingly accomplished poets, the man brought in to teach them verse turned spy again. Berger resumed his activity as an unofficial collaborator in October 1982 with a series of short profiles. One 20-year-old corporal was “clumsy” with a “low level of education”, but also “open and direct”, and therefore useful: he naively confessed that other comrades had warned him off joining the poetry circle because he would be forced “to wave the red flag” there. Not all of the poems were sufficiently confessional: some of the aspiring poets had a disconcerting habit of disguising rather than revealing their true feelings. One sergeant-major, though “undoubtedly talented”, was worryingly “cool, sceptical, self-controlled”. “The thing to get to the bottom of,” Berger wrote in his report, “would be to find out what is really behind the mask, at the bottom of his soul.” Berger’s reports revealed a deeper kind of paranoia at the heart of East Germany’s secret police: an instinctive suspicion not just of themselves but also of the literary creativity that the GDR’s cultural founding fathers had put at the heart of the state. There seemed to be something integral to what poets did that subverted the authority of the Socialist Unity party – a party that was “re-elected” every three to five years in a non-free, non-secret vote, yet claimed that only it was able to read Marx, Engels and Lenin in the correct way. Intellectuals who came up with alternative readings were an instant threat. Berger’s report on Gerd Knauer’s long nuclear-war poem The Bang was particularly troubled by the stanza about Odysseus and Karl Marx. The syntax was ambiguous, he wrote: when Marx said “they are doing it because of me”, was the “it” referring to the other philosophers’ silence, or to nuclear war? And if the latter, were “they” Marx’s followers or his enemies? “The question of guilt is not answered unambiguously,” Berger noted in his report. Knauer implied that “Marx has invented social revolution and is therefore to blame for the imminent annihilation of mankind,” a thesis that amounted to nothing but “idealism and acceptance of surrender”. The poems of the talented teen Alexander Ruika, Berger wrote in a report in April 1983, were “ambivalent”: he had a problem with “power” under socialism. On subjects like collectivism, life in the army and revolution, he reported, the young lyricist was hard to pin down: he was “openly in favour”, but “subliminally against”. But poems didn’t even need to deal with politics to arouse suspicion. In April 1980, the Ministry for State Security’s own thinktank, the Chair for Scientific Communism, had produced a 30-page paper on “solutions to problems in the field of cultural politics”. It claimed that art and culture were especially prone to “covert and subliminal assaults”, because their practitioners employed techniques such as “allegories, metaphors, fables, alienation effects”. On 25 October 1984, Berger wrote that Knauer had read out a poem about a dream in which he flew a kite that “escapes from narrow confinement and sails into freedom”. Berger explained that the kite was what poets called a metaphor, and that the poem was a covert call for East German army personnel to cross over to the west. As Russia, Poland and Hungary embarked on their courses of political and economic reform over the course of the 1980s, the GDR put its foot on the brake and tried to cover its citizens’ eyes and ears. But the new world order was confusing, dizzying even, for many East Germans, including the Stasi major who had run the poetry circle before Berger. Once sidelined for his relentlessly jolly rhymes, he now presented a poem called Stop Going Around in Circles, which sounded more like a blues ballad: Sometimes you are strong, and sometimes weakSometimes you are tired, sometimes awakeSometimes you are brave and don’t know no harmSometimes a single word has the strength to disarm.Sometimes the hottest summer day leaves you coldSometimes you grasp a spider’s web for hold Blues songs are often about loss and despair: “The thrill is gone / It’s gone away for good”, laments BB King. But they tend to end on a flick of redemption, a glimmer of hope in the act of voicing their grief: “You know, I’m free, free now baby / I’m free from your spell”. But the major’s melancholy verses are about a terror that dare not speak its name, ending on a positive note that is even more unsettling because we know its optimism is fake: “And yet you carry on and pretend / That you are happy inside and always content”. I found this poem in a cache that Berger had started to compile for an anthology to commemorate the GDR’s 40th anniversary in 1989, with the working title Man, Soldier, Communist: Poetry and Prose by Writing Chekists. The cache was full of loose pages that looked as if they had been shuffled and reshuffled. The title of the anthology kept on changing, with Berger eventually opting for one that sounded like a gesture of defiance: In My Raised Fist. Pages full of poems were cut, including Stop Going Around in Circles. Instead, Berger picked a poem called Letter of Recruitment: We are Dzerzhinsky’s menTo us our mission is clearready to rise once againready to fight with no fear. A Stasi printing permission slip for the Working Circle of Writing Chekists’ last anthology was issued on 31 December 1989, almost seven weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall. But the booklet never made it to the printers. In the final manuscript, the dedication to the 40th anniversary of the foundation of the GDR and the Ministry for State Security is crossed out. Uwe Berger’s publisher informed him three months after the Wall came down that they would allow his contract to expire the following month. His request for a reissue of his 1987 memoirs, showing his “turn to perestroika”, went unanswered. Two years after his death, in February 2014, a new poetry prize in Berger’s name was to be set up at a literature festival in Berlin’s Köpenick district. But, following objections by Berger’s former colleagues and contemporaries from the East German literary scene, the prize was renamed.

2/5/2022,"Luke Garrard is running through some of the players that Boreham Wood’s BW PASE academy has produced. “We’ve got some unbelievable success stories,” the club’s first-team manager says. “There is Iliman Ndiaye at Sheffield United, Pelly Ruddock at Luton, Sorba Thomas at Huddersfield, who has played for Wales. Ben Goodliffe went into Wolves and is now at Sutton.” There have been others and the headline statistic for the National League high-fliers, who travel to Bournemouth on Sunday for the first FA Cup fourth-round tie of their 74-year history, is that 12 of their youth products have earned contracts at professional clubs. Five of them have become full internationals. Garrard pauses. “It goes beyond all this for me,” he says.  The 36-year-old has been associated with the Hertfordshire club since a brief playing spell in 2005. He would return in 2010 to see out a career that featured rejection by Tottenham at 16, a YTS deal at Swindon and 17 senior appearances for them, and more than 100 games for AFC Wimbledon in the non-league. Garrard got his foot on the coaching ladder at Boreham Wood’s academy in 2008 and he has been the under-18s manager, the academy director and is now the head of football at the academy. He has been the first-team manager since October 2015, having served as the assistant to Ian Allinson. “I’ve done every job from toilet cleaner,” he says with a smile. Under Garrard, Boreham Wood have established themselves in the National League, having been promoted in 2014-15, and they went close to what he calls the “Holy Grail” of the Football League in 2017-18, losing in the Wembley play-off final to Tranmere. They are well-placed this time for another push while the FA Cup run has been “spectacular” and a “fairytale” to borrow Garrard’s words, the high point being the third-round home win over AFC Wimbledon – the third time that the club have taken a Football League scalp in the competition after Blackpool (2017-18) and Southend last season. The excitement before Bournemouth is palpable but to understand Garrard and the club to which he has devoted most of his adult life is to understand the social role of the academy, which the chairman, Danny Hunter, founded in 2002. “We’ve got lads in it that are coming out of the estates in Tottenham and Hackney, in parts of east London, south London, and we have turned their lives around,” Garrard says. “They could either take the wrong road or the right road. So as much as we have the Ilimans and the Sorbas, it is some of the others, the ones that were on the road to prison or death, which are the huge success stories for us.” Garrard mentions one boy who “came in off the streets – from Wembley, Stonebridge way” and is now a fully qualified teacher. The pride is unmistakable. “Look at knife crime, look at gun crime, look at the crime that’s going on in London,” Garrard continues. “When I was growing up in Barnet, there were youth clubs, safe environments, but it’s no longer the case. I don’t think there are many setups for people in lesser privileged areas and that’s a big problem for me. “I’m not preaching and saying we have converted the devil but we are a good club, we’re a good academy. We work ever so hard with our ethics, our mindsets and, yes, we change peoples’ lives. Maybe not all of them but most definitely the majority.” The academy’s acronym stands for “Programme of Academic and Sporting Excellence” and the idea has been to run education courses alongside the football for boys aged between 16 and 19. “When the chairman started it, I think he had 12 lads but it has grown,” Garrard says. “Two or three years ago, there were almost 650 lads and we’re currently running with about 400.” It is the largest programme of its kind in England and everything is on site at the club’s Meadow Park HQ. There is the 5,000-capacity stadium, which is also home to the Arsenal women’s team and stages development-level matches for the Gunners male players. There is the training facility for the first-team, academy and third-party hires, which are to do with the grassroots game. And there are the 11 classrooms and additional study suites. The academy’s education partner is the SCL group, which works with various clubs around the country. Boreham Wood are able to draw down funding that SCL receives from the government in the form of grants to help provide subsidised meals for the academy players, travel allowances and free kit. Garrard is not the only member of the first-team with responsibilities at the academy. The midfielder Connor Smith is the head academy coach while four other players – David Stephens, Femi Ilesanmi, Jamal Fyfield and Kane Smith – also coach there. So does the assistant manager, Lloyd Doyley, the former Watford and Jamaica defender. Boreham Wood’s connection to Arsenal is well established with Hunter, who took over in 1999, feeling that one of his best decisions was to link up early on with the Premier League club’s women’s team. “It gave us a platform, in partnership with Arsenal, to build the club,” Hunter has said. The Arsenal men’s team have played a regular pre-season fixture at Meadow Park throughout Hunter’s tenure. He had been a player for Boreham Wood, as was his son, Charlie, who is now the chief executive, while his father, Mickey, managed them in the 1970s. “The chairman is unbelievable,” Garrard says. “The amount of infrastructure he has put in place, the money he has put back into the club for the academy … Our model is not to have a first-team and then worry about the rest. We are built from the academy up.” One of the drivers for the academy is to help boys who have been released by clubs at 16 – always a shattering blow. It happened to Garrard, who had initially been on Arsenal’s books up to the age of 12, although he says that Spurs actually let him go towards the end of his under-15 season before he ended up sticking around for a final year. Garrard can tell the funny story of how he turned up to his Spurs trial in an Arsenal kit. He had been asked at short notice to wear white and blue and all he had was a strip in those colours from his time at Arsenal, complete with club badge. “When we get lads who come into the system at Boreham Wood, I can talk to them about the hard knocks of getting released, dropping into League One with Swindon and then into non-league,” Garrard says. “Then there is Lloyd Doyley, who has played in the Premier League and in big international games. So they are getting a broad understanding of what it takes to be a player.” And so to Bournemouth, who made eye-catching signings at the end of January to fire their promotion bid from the Championship. “They are unbelievable, Scott Parker is an unbelievable manager and they are really a Premier League club,” Garrard says. “But we are going there to cause an upset. There will be no phones beforehand. We’re not going there to film anything. We are going there with a focus – to win a game of football.”",Sport/Football,‘We have turned lives around’: more to Boreham Wood than an FA Cup run,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/boreham-wood-fa-cup-bournemouth-academy
2/5/2022,"In November 1940, a priest plucked three large medieval nails from the ashes of the blitzed Coventry Cathedral. Fashioned into a cross, they would be at the centre of the altar crucifix in the modernist masterpiece that rose up alongside. That powerful symbol of resurrection and renewal has been replicated several times, sent out around the world as a reminder that wilful destruction need not be the end of the story. One such cross can be found in Odessa, where recently, as thousands of Russian troops massed on their border, Ukrainians told the dean of Coventry they had found strength and consolation in his cathedral’s support during eight years of fear and uncertainty. It reflects Coventry’s declared desire to be seen as a city that, defiant in the face of destruction, chose reconciliation over revenge; one that offers sanctuary, welcoming refugees, asylum seekers and migrants; a city where today, 27% of the population was born outside the UK.  All these aims and achievements cry out to be expressed in profound music; music that might match the stature of Coventry’s cathedral and its signature work, Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem, performed at the opening of the new building 60 years ago. How disappointing, then, that Nitin Sawhney’s Ghosts in the Ruins, commissioned as a “new take” on Britten to mark the anniversary, made such little impact in its attempt to reflect the modern, vibrant city of culture. Britten dovetailed Wilfred Owen’s devastating poetry into the requiem mass. In his desire to take the story on from the grief and loss expressed by Britten, Sawhney interspersed three conventional motets with instrumental interludes and spoken poetry. But while each section was given a heading (Ashes, Phoenix Children, Seeds of Hope, etc), there was only a vague sense of narrative and precious little to stir our emotions. A massive projected portrait of Britten had greeted concertgoers as they arrived, while a recording of the Libera Me from his Requiem played softly in the background. Sawhney read Owen’s searing Dulce et Decorum Est before his remarkably tonal Anglican setting of the same words were sung by the cathedral choir. This proved to be the most successful part of the evening, followed as it was by portentously dull recorded orchestral sections featuring violinist Eos Counsell and Coventry singer YVA. New verse from local poets Emilie Lauren Jones, Landry Affton, Tiur Sitompul, Tanisha Chopra and Hawwa Hussain, extolled the virtues of multicultural Coventry, but we were shown only projected photographs of those communities. We heard none of their music. Counterintuitively, the audience moved out to stand in the ruins of the bombed building for the finale. Here, the cathedral choir was joined by the local singers of Spires Music and the Choir With No Name, which supports and encourages the isolated and marginalised. This warm gesture of solidarity might have been nourished with some thought-provoking music, but instead we had three short, unintelligible, wordless choruses. Such a lost opportunity.",Arts/Music, Ghosts in the Ruins review – Nitin Sawhney’s ‘new take’ on Britten’s War Requiem falls short,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/05/ghosts-in-the-ruins-nitin-sawhney-coventry-cathedral-review-new-take-on-britten-war-requiem-falls-short
2/5/2022,"The trial in Greece of activists who protested against Beijing holding the Winter Olympics has been postponed amid accusations that proceedings were delayed to avoid embarrassing China on the eve of the Games. The highly anticipated hearing had been due to take place on Thursday in the town of Pyrgos, with human rights lawyers travelling from the UK and Athens to attend. The activists, who included a Briton, an American and a Tibetan-Canadian, were arrested when they briefly disrupted the Olympic flame lighting ceremony in October.  “Our pleas to the court for the case to be heard fell on deaf ears,” said Michael Polak at the legal aid group Justice Abroad, who had flown in from London on behalf of the defendants. “They pushed it into the long grass so as not to have to deliver a decision before the Beijing Olympics.” Prior to rescheduling the trial for 1 December 2022, the three-member court’s presiding judge, Vassiliki Reppa, had instead focused on cases concerning boundary infringements and other minor disputes. “We made an express plea to bring the case forward, as it was towards the end of the listed hearings, but the bench strongly refused to do so,” said Antonio Bachouros, a local lawyer also defending the activists. “They could have prioritised the case, given its sensitivity and the seriousness of the accusations, but chose not to.” A court official told the Guardian on Friday it would not be commenting on the tribunal’s decision. Human rights defenders have called for the “farcical” charges to be dropped. The trio stands accused of attempting to “pollute, damage and distort” a historical monument – punishable by up to five years in prison under Greek law. All three were pinned to the ground before being detained in police cells for more than two days after waving a Tibetan flag and unfurling a “No genocide Games” banner during the ceremony. “The protest itself must have lasted less than a minute,” said Free Tibet’s Jason Leith, expressing disappointment that the trial had not gone ahead. “Our aim was never to cause damage, and it is absurd to say that we did. All we had was a flag and a banner. We just wanted our voice to be heard in solidarity with all those oppressed by the Chinese Communist party.” Speaking from London, where he lives, the 34-year-old described how he was tackled to the ground and told not to move or make any sound as the ceremony, filmed live by China’s state media, continued. “It was totally peaceful. We had hidden up in the hill above the ruins and when they saw us emerge, chanting, security forces pounced. I had the foot of a policeman on my back for about 15 minutes.” On 17 October, a day earlier, two student activists, a Tibetan-American and Hong Kongese-American, were arrested in Athens as they chanted “Boycott Beijing 2022” and attempted to drape a Tibetan flag and a banner in support of freedom in Hong Kong from the Acropolis. They, too, were detained in police custody overnight. Their trial, on the same charge, had been due to take place last week, but was postponed after a snowstorm forced the closure of courts and other parts of the public sector. In both cases, activists say they were protesting against the use of Olympic symbols for propaganda purposes by a Chinese regime responsible for crimes against humanity in Uyghur camps, repression of Tibetans and the continuing crackdown in Hong Kong. “There was neither destruction nor damage to the sites and the accusation is groundless and invalid,” said the prominent human rights lawyer Alexis Anagnostakis. “They chose the Acropolis and Olympia as symbols of democracy and the cradle of western civilisation … They deserve praise instead of arrests and handcuffs.” Rights groups described the “disproportionate” criminalisation of people protesting against abuses as especially worrying. “They are not criminals,” said Pema Doma at the New York-based Students For a Free Tibet. “The international community must not allow them to be scapegoated through Beijing’s growing influence in democratic countries.” But experts in Sino-Greek relations say the protests will undoubtedly have been seen as an unnecessary irritant. Athens has long been hesitant to censure Chinese president Xi Jinping, and infuriated other western capitals when it vetoed an EU condemnation of China’s human rights record at the UN in 2017. China is a major investor in the Mediterranean nation, pumping around €1bn into the country at the height of its debilitating debt crisis, when it acquired a majority stake in the strategic port of Piraeus. “Greek authorities, mostly for political reasons, are very reluctant to embarrass China,” said Plamen Tonchev, who heads the Asia unit at the Athens-based Institute of International Economic Relations. “Indicative of this cautiousness is its consistent abstention from any statements – and there have been many since 2019 – that criticise China’s policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.” Pollak said that, despite their disappointment, the activists not only remained determined to fight “this politically motivated and ridiculous case”, but to take the matter all the way to the European court of human rights. “The Greek state is in breach of its international obligations under the European convention on human rights by prosecuting this case, no matter the eventual result,” he said, adding that freedom of expression and peaceful assembly were considered sacrosanct by the Strasbourg-based tribunal. “China’s strong influence over Greece’s leadership and institutions should be worrying for all Greek people, who have a strong history and belief in standing up against totalitarianism.”",News/World news,Trial of protesters against Beijing Olympics postponed in Greece,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/trial-of-protesters-against-beijing-olympics-postponed-in-greece
2/5/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has rejected calls for Boris Johnson to resign in order to restore trust after the “partygate” scandal, claiming that the “vast majority” of the party were behind the prime minister. It comes after the former schools minister, Nick Gibb, became the latest Conservative MP to publicly call for Johnson to go, citing constituents “furious about the double standards” and the prime minster’s “inaccurate” statements in the Commons.  It also follows reports that the Metropolitan police, who were given 300 pictures by Sue Gray for its investigation into Covid rule-breaking social gatherings, have a photograph of Johnson holding a can of beer at his lockdown birthday party in June 2020. According to the Mirror, the prime minister is pictured with a can of Estrella while standing next to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in No 10’s Cabinet Room. The newspaper reported that the picture was taken by Johnson’s official photographer, funded by the taxpayer, who was documenting the event. Dorries claimed on Saturday that the Conservative voices of dissent, including from Gibb, the MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, Aaron Bell, and former policy chief Munira Mirza, were “disappointing” but insisted “it’s not many”. “The vast majority of Conservative MPs are right behind the prime minister because he has delivered, he has consistently delivered, and he will continue to do so,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Gibb, the MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, wrote in the Daily Telegraph: “I am sorry to say that it is hard to see how it can be the case that the prime minister told the truth.” He has also reportedly submitted a letter of no confidence to the chairman of the 1922 Committee. In response, Dorries insisted that “the prime minister has told the truth”. Asked whether Johnson needs to change, Dorries launched an impassioned defence of the prime minister, saying: “I’d be cautious of asking the prime minister who’s delivered us the largest majority since Margaret Thatcher to change.” She added: “That commitment to delivery, both on vaccines and on employment and on many issues, I want the prime minister, that prime minister, who has that kind of onwards mentality, I want that to remain. I don’t want that to change.” Responding to Rishi Sunak’s response on Thursday distancing himself from the prime minister’s false claim that the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, failed to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile, Dorries said the chancellor was “entitled to his views” but defended Johnson’s response. “What I would say is that when you lead an organisation, you are responsible,” she said. Speaking on Sky News, Dorries insisted that 97% of Tory MPs back the prime minister and that Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is fully behind him, despite distancing himself from Johnson’s Savile claim. She said Javid was “quite shocked” about how his comments had been reported and that he was “100% behind the prime minister”. During another media appearance, on BBC Breakfast, Dorries said the prime minister was “very positive” when she communicated with him in the past 24 hours, but questioned why she was being asked whether she had spoken to him. Meanwhile, former minister Liam Fox said he has not submitted a letter of no confidence and that “it’s very clear” that the Conservatives’ 15% threshold for a no-confidence vote had not been reached. But, the MP for North Somerset said he was “waiting to see what comes out of” the full Gray report. The partygate debate, he said, was “diminishing the focus” from other political issues such as inflation rises and Ukraine and damaging perceptions of UK politics both at home and abroad. He said: “The whole issue round whether rules were broken in Downing Street in 2020 now needs to be resolved by what the police are investigating. We didn’t get the full coverage of what Sue Gray had said and I think we need to get all this information.”",News/Politics,Dorries claims vast majority of Tories behind Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/nadine-dorries-claims-vast-majority-of-tories-behind-boris-johnson
