3/19/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for “meaningful and fair” talks without delay to Russia’s invasion, framing it as a chance for Moscow to limit the damage created by its own mistakes. In a video address early on Saturday, Zelenskiy said: “It’s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise Russia’s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.” “The war must end,” he added. “Ukraine’s proposals are on the table.” Earlier, Vladimir Putin claimed in a call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, that Kyiv was “attempting to stall peace talks” but Moscow was still keen to continue negotiations. In the south, at least 40 Ukrainian soldiers were reported killed following a Russian air strike on an army barracks in the city of Mykolaiv, according to local media reports. The mayor of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Senkevich, said on Facebook on Friday that several villages in the region had been occupied and the city had been under heavy fire, calling it a “difficult day”. Fighting continues in the key port city of Mariupol, with Ukraine’s defence ministry saying late on Friday it had “temporarily” lost access to the Sea of Azov, which connects to the Black Sea and would be a major loss for Ukraine. Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” there by deliberately blocking supplies from reaching the city in a bid to force residents to comply with their attackers. Calling the move a war crime, the president said Russian soldiers would face a “one-way compulsory ticket to the Hague”, where the international criminal court sits. More than 350,000 civilians have been stranded with little food or water in Mariupol, which was under constant bombardment on Friday. Russia said its forces were “tightening the noose” around the city, where an estimated 80% of the city’s homes had been damaged. Some 9,000 people have managed to flee Mariupol, while work continues to reach the hundreds of civilians believed to be trapped in a shelter under the city’s theatre, which was destroyed by Russian bombing on Wednesday. About 130 people have been rescued from the rubble, some seriously injured. There is no word yet on a death toll. Across the nation, Zelenskiy said the advance of Russian forces had ground to a halt, a view echoed by western intelligence agencies. The continued targeting of civilians in Mariupol was said by the British military to be a sign of Russia’s failures in the first three weeks of the war. Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, chief of defence intelligence, said: “The Kremlin has so far failed to achieve its original objectives. It has been surprised by the scale and ferocity of Ukrainian resistance, and has been bedevilled with problems of its own making. “Russian operations have changed. Russia is now pursuing a strategy of attrition. This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis. “Putin has reinforced his control over Russian domestic media. The Kremlin is attempting to control the narrative, hide operational problems and obscure high Russian casualty numbers from the Russian people.” In other developments: Zelenskiy said he would continue to appeal to world leaders to call for peace in Ukraine, with plans to address Switzerland, Italy, Israel and Japan. He has spoken with Ukrainian ambassadors around the world “to intensify the supply of humanitarian goods” for displaced people in Ukraine. Joe Biden in a two-hour call with China’s Xi Jinping “described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians”, the White House said, without giving further details. The Chinese account of the conversation in the state news agency, Xinhua, said it was “candid and in-depth”. The UN has reported 816 confirmed civilian deaths. Kyiv officials said 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children. It said more than 3.2 million people have fled, with 2 million displaced inside the country. Putin has praised national “unity” during a rare public speech at a rally in a Moscow stadium to mark the eighth anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. “The country hasn’t seen unity like this in a long time,” Putin said, addressing a large flag-waving crowd on Friday from a stage decked out with slogans such as “For a world without Nazism” and “For our president”. Moscow police said more than 200,000 people were in and around the Luzhniki Stadium. Zelenskiy referred to the rally in his own address, urging viewers to imagine the stadium filled with Russia’s 14,000 war dead and tens of thousands more injured.",News/World news,Ukraine’s Zelenskiy calls for urgent peace talks and warns of catastrophe in Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/ukraines-zelenskiy-calls-for-urgent-peace-talks-and-warns-of-catastrophe-in-mariupol
3/19/2022,"I love the NHS. I know this is a fashionable thing to say, but it also has a whiff of naivety. It is like saying I love autumn, or chocolate. Sure, those things are great, but they are also big things that are complex and loving them unconditionally seems to avoid important criticisms (the waiting lists for essential surgeries, the leaves on the train tracks and taking your dog to the vet every Easter, respectively). I mean, of course, that I love the idea of a nationalised health service, rather than the dysfunctional, underfunded service we have, where staff are even more overworked and underpaid now than they were when I left more than a decade ago. I love the idea of a system in which our freedoms in a pandemic aren’t contingent on avoiding it becoming overwhelmed – despite it coming close to being overwhelmed in a normal year (and, as I write, Covid cases and hospital admissions are once again rising). But I didn’t truly grasp the big idea – that health care has to be free at the point of access – until I got ill. Only a few careers offer the chance to switch roles and find out what it is like on the other side of a metaphorical desk. Some students end up becoming teachers, some unfortunate barristers end up as “the accused”, and many doctors are eventually horrified, as I was in March 2020, to find themselves in a backless gown, on a gurney in A&E, being asked: “What seems to be the trouble?” In my case, I knew exactly what the trouble was. I was recovering from a Covid infection and had woken at three in the morning with my heart beating way too fast and in a chaotic rhythm that caused an unpleasant sensation akin to a misfiring engine in my chest. I felt bad: faint, sweaty, breathless, panicky. I knew, from taking my pulse, that I had a problem called atrial fibrillation – and although it wasn’t life-threatening, it did need to be fixed. So, pausing only to congratulate myself on my diagnostic skills, I called a taxi to A&E. From the moment I arrived, the vast machinery of the NHS swung into action, although I didn’t realise it at the time. Since then, I have been into hospital dozens of times and had countless video consultations, scans and other investigations. All of this led to me having an ablation: a procedure that froze away the bit of my heart that Covid seemed to have damaged. This appears, for the moment, to have cured me. But when I sat down in the triage room and the nurse began covering me with stickers and electrodes to get a recording of my heart, all I felt was relief that someone was now looking after me. All I had had to do was turn up and say I didn’t feel well. Healthcare has to be as frictionless as possible. As soon as people have to fill out forms, call an insurance company or produce a credit card, they stop coming. It is inconvenient enough being ill without having to do extra, expensive admin. I was a pretty dismal patient: I didn’t want to take pills, I didn’t want my operation and I complained every time they shaved my chest to stick on the electrodes. My treatment required extraordinary, underpaid people to care more than I did about what happened next. All I did was open the letters from the hospital, read them and turn up. In the US, the admin for a health problem like mine would have been a part-time job. But my doctors and nurses weren’t getting paid for each procedure or each test, so there were no financial incentives distorting the decisions. They just wanted to find out what was wrong with me, fix me and get me out of the building. I trusted everyone and everyone who looked after me went above and beyond the simple requirements of the job. Three people stood out. First, Dr Phil Gothard, an old friend who happened to see me in an A&E follow-up clinic. At the end of the consultation, he said: “You mustn’t let being ill make you think differently about yourself. You’re still the same person, just one bit of you isn’t working very well.” If I ever start seeing patients again, I will say that to all of them. Second was Prof Toby Hillman, a respiratory consultant at University College hospital. Faced with a new disease, he and his team had to figure out how to study it while they were treating it in the middle of the pandemic. Unbelievable. Finally, Dr Oliver Segal, who was eventually proved right about me needing an operation – and was gracious enough not to rub it in my face. Anyone who says the NHS needs to be improved is right. There are huge deficiencies in its abilities to meet people’s needs and, in many ways, I was very lucky. But, in the past two years, I have learned that the core of its design is extraordinary. The nationalised system means that it relies on salaried professionals who are incentivised by the rewards of patient care. I wouldn’t want to be ill in any healthcare system that didn’t offer that.

3/19/2022,"Afew weeks ago, Adwoa Aboah experienced what she describes as “a sombre moment”. “I was at my mum and dad’s, clearing out my childhood room,” she says, her voice a little shaky. “I was going through all these old Vogues I had kept, and I was like … ‘Why did I do that? What was I looking at … who was I looking at?’ Because no one in these magazines looks like me.” Despite signing with the giant modelling agency Storm at 16, Aboah’s self-esteem as a teenager and into her 20s was, she says, “so low. I was on this trajectory of really wanting to be someone else. I couldn’t count on my hands any models who looked like me who were killing it. Obviously there was Jourdan Dunn, and Naomi Campbell, but … ” she pauses, sighs. “I didn’t have the emotional intelligence, nor the language, to articulate why I wasn’t doing well, why I wasn’t in the places that I thought should have been an option for me. Why wasn’t I being supported by British publications? I was like: ‘Is it me? What’s wrong with me?’ Not in a kind of self-pitying way but … I just didn’t understand.” Now 29, Aboah is one of Britain’s most recognisable and successful models, as likely to be seen endorsing Dior or Burberry as H&M or Gap. She was named model of the year by the British Fashion Council in 2017 and, in the same year, memorably featured on the cover of Edward Enninful’s first issue of British Vogue, a vision of retro cool in a patterned headscarf and masses of blue eyeshadow. She’s also an activist, having founded the organisation Gurls Talk – which educates young women on topics including feminism, race, sex and body image – in 2015, and now she has her first regular acting role in the new series of Netflix’s Top Boy, one of the coolest shows on TV. It’s hard to believe that Aboah ever felt like a misfit and, worse still, thought that it was somehow her fault. In fact, the Londoner always had the kind of star quality that marked her out as one to watch, if not by fashion’s gatekeepers, then by those in the know. Her barefaced beauty – complete with a constellation of freckles – made her something of an It girl in the early 2010s (ie, the Daily Mail started publishing articles about her tattoos). That role grew when she shaved off her previously relaxed copper hair into a gamine buzzcut in 2015. Aboah was deemed “unconventionally beautiful” by many in the media, perhaps a subtle way of saying that she did not fit Eurocentric beauty standards; for many more, she was the representation they had been yearning for. However, there were several years when it felt as if her career had stalled. “It’s a weird one,” Aboah says, dialling in as she hotfoots it from central London to the airport, a place where she spends much of her time (she is based between the UK and LA). “With the conversations that we’ve had since around race and diversity, we understand what was going on. But back then, I was like: ‘I don’t get it.’ I started at the same time as Cara [Delevingne], maybe a little after Edie [Campbell], but I hadn’t really been given my moment. With my British Vogue cover, my career kind of took off. But I’d been modelling for a long time. I’d been waiting in the hope of getting my chance.” Today, Aboah’s shaved head is gone, replaced by cornrows that cut across her scalp in entrancingly neat, diagonal lines. Even so, she remains instantly recognisable, as much for her face – flanked by ears adorned from top to bottom with gold rings and precious trinkets – as her west London drawl. The daughter of Camilla Lowther, a British model turned influential talent agency boss, and Charles Aboah, who is from Ghana, once described as London’s go-to location scout for editorial shoots, Aboah grew up in Notting Hill, immersed in the fashion business. Her younger sister, Kesewa, is an artist. Much has been written about her family’s privilege (in a recent interview, the Lowthers’ ancestral home was brought up, to which Aboah, seemingly wearily, replied she would “have to look that up”). She was educated at Millfield school in Somerset, where current annual fees for boarding stand at around £40,000, and she has spoken frequently about her difficulties there – relaxing her hair to fit in with the white, straight-haired masses, but ending up with something that resembled, in her words, “the end of a broom”. She began using drugs heavily as a teen, and today she describes it as a “deeply unhappy” period. On graduating from Brunel University in 2013, she co-founded a casting agency, AAMØ, before moving into modelling. But despite her connections, doors remained closed to her, and repeated rejections hit her hard. “I think I went into it with a rose-tinted idea of what it could be,” she says. “Because of my mum being in the fashion industry, and because I knew everyone, people probably assumed that I was going to get these big jobs. But the industry was so different then.” Besides, she says, she didn’t feel as if she had much support: “One would hope that you were in a team where they really believed in you.” – In 2015, she departed Storm for Tess Management. While her recent bedroom clearout was difficult, reminding her of the rejections of her early career, Aboah says it was also “enlightening”, emphasising for her just how far fashion has come in a short space of time, in terms of embracing diversity. Of course, British Vogue is just one part of that world, but it is a big part – the aspirational “style bible” that, for generations, drip-fed teens like the young Aboah with images of mostly white, often stick-thin models and impossibly expensive clothes. When she left the magazine in 2017, former editor Alexandra Shulman told the Guardian that she had offered Aboah a Vogue cover but Aboah had turned her down. Shulman also wondered if Aboah “maybe … knew she was going to get [Enninful’s first] cover.” I ask Aboah whether she remembers it that way. She “hmms” for a second, before saying that she “didn’t pay much attention” to Shulman’s comments. “Someone sent me the piece. She said something like I was the best kind of Black girl … I can’t even remember how she worded it, it was something quite weird. [Shulman called her “the perfect mixture of mixed race, sort of posh Notting Hill royalty … the perfect cover star.”] Absolutely no shade to her as an editor, but [Enninful’s cover] made sense. It felt like a new beginning. I wanted to be part of that.” Over email, Enninful – a friend of Aboah’s – has only the highest praise for her, telling me he wanted to “highlight the best of Britain, in all of its unique, diverse and multitalented glory. Adwoa represented all of those facets for me … to see this Black British woman leading the way in my industry while also drawing attention to important social issues was really inspiring.” The cover came after a new beginning for Aboah herself. After spells in rehab and, in 2014, a suicide attempt that left her in a coma for four days, she took time out of the industry, getting treatment for the depression and addiction problems that had lingered since her teens. (In a 2017 video interview with her mother, Camilla, Aboah describes not feeling able to share her depression with her family; Camilla admits that the family were “all in denial … until you tried to kill yourself”). Recovery and getting sober led her to work with nonprofit organisations, before founding her own in 2015. “People think Gurls Talk came later, when my career took off, but it was definitely birthed from the rock bottom that I’d been at, and the support that I’d been given,” Aboah says. “I’d been given tools for how to be honest for the first time. I was looking at things I’d been too scared to look at.” Alongside global events that, pre-pandemic, took place everywhere from Italy to Ghana, Gurls Talk now produces a podcast in which Aboah has “fierce female chat” and candid conversations about mental health and wellbeing (guests have included novelists Bernardine Evaristo and Lisa Taddeo; activists Soma Sara and Janaya Future Khan; and fellow model Emily Ratajkoswki). With Gurls Talk, she says she finally “found her purpose”, converting her trauma into something meaningful. A few days before we speak, a new report says that girls’ mental health in the UK is “on a precipice”, with 11-year-old girls 30% more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression than boys. Aboah says it’s “terrifying”, and we talk briefly about teens, online bullying, and the reactive nature of social media where “people word-vomit things they might regret”, before she admits that these things consume her, too. “I’m turning 30 this year, and I don’t know about you, but sometimes … I mean – my behaviour is so toxic on social media. I have to take a backseat and be like: ‘The way I’m comparing myself with other people isn’t healthy.’ It can be the weirdest things … suddenly you’re worrying about the fact that – obviously I’m being silly here – your ears aren’t small enough. Even now, during London Fashion Week, it’s like: ‘I’m not doing the shows; I should be doing the shows.’ It’s like, ‘No, you’re doing something amazing, you’re getting this moment to be in this TV show.’ We put so much pressure on ourselves. So I can’t even imagine what it must be like, growing up now. It’s very obvious with the information out there that no young girl should be on social media.” As for her own social media posts, they lean more towards the artfully detached and carefree – sure, there are glossy magazine shoots on her Instagram grid, but there are also snaps of her wearing Minnie Mouse ears at Disneyland and, recently, a phallic cactus. After the murder of George Floyd, and a renewed energy around the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020, Aboah found her conversations on her Gurls Talk podcast getting “a lot deeper. Everyone had so much to say, and everyone was going through such personal experiences, growth and sadness.” It also led to a second Vogue cover, this time alongside Marcus Rashford, shot in the footballer’s garden in Manchester, for an issue spotlighting “faces of hope”. It was a huge moment – and one she almost turned down. At the time, Aboah says, she “didn’t think it was my place to be that person. I think it’s because I hadn’t really delved into race and my feelings around it, and what I had been through. My mum’s white, my dad’s Black, and there had been a lot of confusion personally as to how I felt about it all. And, actually, it was great.” There’s a sense of gratitude in her voice as she describes “championing the Black community … I’m really happy that I did take that opportunity, because I am very much part of that community. I am a Black woman. I have a lot of things to say, which I hadn’t had the confidence to speak about.” Suddenly, Aboah felt she could make her voice heard. “When people said, ‘It’s not as bad here in the UK,’ others were standing up and saying, ‘It is. There aren’t guns, we aren’t being shot at, but it’s definitely here.’” Even so, there was discomfort mixed in with the epiphanies. She had, she says, “a full-on identity crisis. It was a mad time, and we were all having to look at ourselves. Within the realm of fashion, for example, I had this new confidence. I was like: ‘I’m not going to tolerate someone doing my hair again who doesn’t understand Black hair.’ Not because I’m a diva, but because it’s not right.” Aboah had another realisation over lockdown, when she decided that if she wanted to become an actor, it was now or never (she previously had a bit part in the 2017 big-screen anime adaptation Ghost in the Shell, with Scarlett Johansson). Her voice fizzes with excitement at the mention of Top Boy, the east London-set drama that was resurrected by Netflix in 2019, six years after being cancelled by Channel 4. Executive produced by Canadian rapper Drake, the reboot upped the budget, chucking in a who’s who of UK musicians including Dave and Little Simz, as well as bringing back original cast members such as Ashley Walters and Kano. The latest series ups the production sheen even further, with diversions into the drug trade in Spain and Morocco straight out of Narcos. “It’s mad, to be quite honest,” Aboah laughs. “I cannot even begin to tell you how much I wanted this role. I definitely sit on the more obsessive side of things in terms of my character – I’m obsessed with manifesting. I auditioned about three or four times and I was overwhelmed with how much I wanted it. It was so out of my comfort zone, and such a challenge.” Aboah is keen to stress that this is something she has wanted for a long time. “At school, I wasn’t passing with straight As or anything like that,” she says. “So I really leaned into my more creative side.” While experiments with the guitar proved unfruitful, “theatre was my first love. I was shy and nervous at boarding school. I was away from home, and away from my family and friends. Another girl had seen me sitting by myself all the time – she was like, ‘This girl is quite depressed.’ So she asked me if I wanted to audition for the school play. We’re still friends now.” Aboah was part of the National Youth Theatre and did a degree in drama. Rather than being seduced by the bright lights of the modelling industry, it seems she just wasn’t in the right headspace for acting. “After university, I didn’t really have a good head on my shoulders – my work ethic wasn’t necessarily that great.” She was, she says, “a bit distracted … by partying and all sorts of things. But before Covid, I knew that I really wanted to give it a chance. I got an agent and started doing acting classes.” In Top Boy, she plays Becks, a love interest for Jasmine Jobson’s tough-as-nails gang member Jaq. It’s not a big role, but it is a memorable one, as the decidedly middle-class addition to a show set in a working-class world. There’s even a scene where another character ponders why Becks doesn’t tap up the bank of mum and dad for a bigger flat. As someone in a heterosexual relationship, did the prospect of portraying a same-sex couple – and one that attracts negative attention in the series – faze her? “I think the women’s storylines stand alone, away from what’s going on with the men,” she says. “You really get to know these women. By no means do I think I understand homophobia, but I was able to talk to friends in the queer community and get an understanding of what they’ve had to deal with. And going back to what we’ve been speaking about, I understand discrimination. I hope that I’ve been able to tell the story authentically.” What has it been like to engage with a series based on a world so different from her own background? “London is filled with so many different people,” she says. “It’s easy to say that we’re all segregated, and none of us mix. But living in west London, I’ve been around different types of people my whole entire life. I might have gone to private school, but I’ve been brought up around a multifaceted community. I don’t think I’ve ever felt intimidated by being from a different world.” Aboah has to catch her flight, but before she logs off, she tells me that she is already “on cloud nine” at the prospect of showing what she can do as an actor. A few days after we speak, she posts a childhood photo on Instagram – possibly one dug out in her bedroom clearout. Unlike most people’s childhood snaps, it was published in the triannual fashion magazine Pop, and shot by the photographer Alice Hawkins. In it, Aboah is dressed smartly, a serious look on her face and her hair in braids, younger but in many ways identical. Alongside it runs the caption: “By popular demand. Shy and 12 years old … Haven’t changed at all …” Aboah’s life has changed since those days, and yet in many ways she’s stayed the same, as the world has changed around her. The picture reminds me of something she told me about her dad: “He turned to me, years ago, and said: ‘I was just waiting for you to realise what you are capable of achieving.’” Binning her old magazines might have been a wrench, but it reminded her that she was always on the right track.

3/19/2022,"I am sitting in my office at the end of the garden when an email arrives from my wife, in the house. The subject line says: “You are invited to come and see my new chair.” The message itself has no content. When the oldest one first suggested he might move out, my wife made plain her intentions to commandeer a bedroom as an office. She’d been working at a table behind the living room door for several years, where she considered herself insufficiently cut off from the rest of us. “What are you doing here?” she would say, turning from her computer, every time I walked in. “It’s 7pm,” I would say. “I’m living my life, in the living room.” “Sitting room.” “I’m sitting my ass down, in the sitting room,” I’d say, turning on the TV. “I’m still working.” “I’ve got peanuts.” I don’t know the average time it takes for a parent to transform a child’s bedroom into office space – both logistics and sentimentality must play a part – but on my wife’s behalf I would like to submit a bid for the world record: just under 14 hours. It was about 5pm when we left the oldest one in his new flat and drove home, into the setting sun, in an empty van. Next morning I was woken by the sound of furniture being dragged about, followed by hoovering. By the time I was dressed, my wife was nailing pictures to the wall. “Where did this rug come from?” I said. “I just need you to carry my table up,” she said, beaming. “And to put my day bed together.” “Day bed?” I said. “It’s in a box downstairs,” she said. Within the hour she had installed herself and let it be known that from now on access was by appointment only. Standing up from my desk, I wonder if I need to print out the invitation to see the new chair. I also wonder if it’s really just an invitation to assemble the new chair. I cross the garden to the kitchen and head upstairs. From the landing I can see the youngest one in his bedroom, working. The door beyond his is firmly shut. I open it. My wife looks up from her computer. “Can I help you?” she says. “I believe I’m expected,” I say. “Look!” she says, pointing to the tubular steel chair, padded in some kind of fake leather. “Forty-five pounds!” “Nice,” I say, thinking: no assembly required. “But it’s not really a desk chair.” “I already have a desk chair,” she says. “That’s just for when people come up to see me. Not you.” “That’s fine: I can always sit here,” I say, flopping on to the day bed. “No,” she says. Light streams through the window. “Comfortable,” I say, lying down. The day bed is where the oldest one will sleep if he ever comes home again. “OK, you’re dismissed, thanks,” my wife says. “This is a cool place to hang out in the afternoons,” I say, closing my eyes. “Please,” she says. “I’m trying to work.” “We’re all trying to work,” says the youngest one from next door. “I also have work to do,” I say. “I could bring my laptop up here for a bit.” “Get out,” my wife says. I retreat to the kitchen and, eventually, back to my office shed, where I sit staring at a computer screen until the sun goes down and the heater clicks off. I don’t begrudge my wife her new office, even if it’s bigger than mine, and nicer than mine, with a commanding view of the street, and its own bed. She deserves a room of her own. She has waited a long time for it. And she will never know that I sometimes go up and sit in there when she’s out, because I will be able to see her approaching from a long way off. It’s past 6:30pm when I go in and pour myself a glass of wine, putting the last of the peanuts in a bowl. The sitting room, to my surprise, is dark and cold. The curtains have yet to be drawn. And in the spot where my wife had been hard at work every time I entered this room over the past two years, there are only a few boxes and part of a dusty drum kit. I close the curtains, turn on a few lights, remove my shoes and sit down on the sofa. But before I turn on the TV, I sit in silence for a while, straining to hear my wife’s fingers tapping at her keyboard upstairs.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"My wife now has an office of her own, and I’m not welcome there",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/19/tin-dowling-my-wife-now-has-an-office-of-her-own-and-im-not-welcome-there
3/19/2022,"Speaking behind a podium bearing the Ukrainian state emblem, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his now signature green attire, calls on his soldiers to lay down their weapons and return to their families. The one-minute clip is a deepfake, the term for a sophisticated hoax that uses artificial intelligence to create a phoney image, most commonly fake videos of people. What unfolded next was the latest episode in the infowar that has accompanied the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a war being waged across social media platforms, via satellite images of battlefields and on hackers’ keyboards. Zelenskiy posted a bona fide response on his Instagram account on Wednesday dismissing the “childish provocation” and telling Russian troops to return home. His response to the deepfake, which remains of unknown provenance and is not of a high quality, received more than 5m views. Social media platforms swung into action as well. Facebook and Instagram’s owner, Meta, said it had removed the video from its services and tipped off other platforms after the deepfake appeared on a reportedly hacked Ukrainian news site and started spreading across the internet. Twitter said it was “actively” tracking the video and removing it if it was being displayed without comment or held up as real. Sam Gregory, programme director at Witness, a technology-focused human rights group, said the Ukrainian response showed Zelenskiy’s team had an effective strategy in place to deal with this type of disinformation. “The Ukrainians had warned about a video like this,” he said, referring to pre-bunking efforts. “Then the video itself was poor quality and discernible as faked to the human eye and ear. And then the subject of the deepfake was able to rapidly rebut it in real-time, via his own social media channels to an audience who trusts him.” One expert said the concept of an infowar between Russia and Ukraine and its allies needed be seen in a global context. “Ukraine is doing an extraordinary job. It is making sure the world understands the gravity of the situation and the fight that they’re undertaking on behalf of the rest of democracy,” said Andy Carvin, managing editor of the digital forensic research lab at the Atlantic Council, a US thinktank. Russia has “failed and fumbled”, he said, including by “posting questionable videos of doubtful provenance”. Hackers have claimed success too in hampering the state narrative inside Russia, with the RT news service among the websites targeted by distributed denial of service attacks that render sites unreachable. The volume of DDoS attacks since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began has “disproportionately targeted Russia”, according to Recorded Future, which monitors cyber threats. But Carvin cautioned against drawing only positive conclusions from the infowar. “It’s very easy for us in the west to assume well, they stink at this, and Ukraine is winning the argument online and in public discourse. But if you look around region by region, or even within certain countries, you’ll see very different narratives spreading.” Carvin pointed to Russia, where Facebook and Instagram are blocked, access to Twitter is heavily restricted, all western content has been barred on TikTok, and dissent has been all but quashed. “From Putin’s perspective, domestically, I think he’s probably fairly happy with where things stand,” he said. Internationally, RT and another state-owned news service, Sputnik, have been removed in the UK and EU by Facebook and Instagram, and RT’s UK broadcast licence was revoked on Friday. But Carvin noted that RT and Sputnik are “thriving” in South America and pointed to a recent study showing that 50% of posts examined on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform, backed Russia’s argument that the war was the fault of western countries, Nato or Ukraine. In places like sub-Saharan Africa, he said, the Russian narrative was also playing well. “Region by region, it’s not necessarily looking as great as it may appear through our lenses,” he said. Other aspects of the infowar are more difficult for Russia to counter, thanks to open source intelligence, or OSINT. OSINT refers to publicly accessible information, from mobile phone footage to images made available by Maxar, a commercial satellite company, which are then scrutinised by organisations like investigative journalism site Bellingcat. “OSINT is playing a transformational role in the information landscape surrounding the political and military conflict in Ukraine,” said Justin Crow, a researcher at the University of Sussex school of engineering and informatics. “It is helping to inform high-level strategic decisions, as well as keeping the general public informed. Perhaps most importantly, it is helping to prevent Russia from dominating the narrative around the war.”For some Russians, the dwindling information options are not a deterrent to seeking out the truth. Mikhail, a 29-year-old consultant in Moscow, said that the ban on social media and independent outlets would not affect the way he consumed the news. “I saw this coming from a mile away, this was expected given in which directions the authorities are moving,” said Mikhail who got a virtual private network, which allows you to access sites blocked in your country, at the end of last year. “Getting real information about the invasion is very important to me. I don’t want to become a zombie watching state television.”",News/World news,Deepfakes v pre-bunking: is Russia losing the infowar?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/russia-ukraine-infowar-deepfakes

3/19/2022,"If you had a nasty shock when you last filled up your car or received your latest gas bill, spare a thought for the 1.5 million rural households who rely on oil deliveries to heat their home. Many of them have seen prices more than triple over the past six months – and that’s assuming they can find a company willing to deliver. Last September, consumers were paying about £250 for a 500-litre delivery of domestic heating oil. Fast forward to this week and the price had leapt to between £600 and as much as £875 for those requiring an urgent delivery. The UK’s biggest domestic oil distributor, Certas, is among those that have been forced to suspend their normal pricing practices as the war in Ukraine sent prices rocketing. The market has in part broken down as suppliers have been cancelling broker-ordered deliveries, fearing they may be selling at a loss. Normally, heating oil buyers agree a price and the delivery date when ordering. But the extreme price fluctuations in recent days have left suppliers taking orders and then contacting customers on the day of delivery with the price – and asking them whether they still want to go ahead. Unlike those living in houses connected to the gas grid, people using oil to heat their homes are not covered by Ofgem’s price cap – leaving them at the mercy of rising oil prices. They tend to be living in rural locations, often in older, poorly insulated properties. Charities including Citizens Advice have called for the price cap on gas supplies to be extended to the domestic heating oil market. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, prices had increased alarmingly. About 65% of the quoted price of heating oil – which is very similar to diesel sold on forecourts – is based on the crude oil price seven to 10 days previously. On 18 March, oil prices hit almost $130 (£99) a barrel but have since dropped to about $100 at the time of writing. In early December, suppliers were paying $69 for a barrel of crude. So hefty have the price rises for oil deliveries been during the last two weeks that typically only those who have run out – or are about to run out – have been ordering. Some experts are advising those who are not yet in that position to hold out in the hope that the market stabilises. Imogen Pursch is one of thousands of people caught up in the turmoil. She and her sister moved to rural Herefordshire last November, and the house they bought is off the gas grid, meaning they have to rely on oil. “We bought 500 litres of oil in November and it cost £340 back then. That’s about a quarter of a tank, and we expected it to last until April,” she says. However, when their parents announced they would visit, they realised they would need another delivery to make sure the house would be warm enough. “We were looking at the BoilerJuice oil broker website and, for a week or so, no one was delivering to our house. Then finally on 2 March they were, and we agreed to pay £540 for 500 litres for delivery, eight days later.” But on that day Imogen got a text alerting her to an email cancelling her order. The company blamed “world events” and said the supplier was unable to go ahead. BoilerJuice told her it would arrange a refund but Imogen has little choice but to try it again. Her latest quote was £850. “When we filled up in November, I was expecting to spend £650-£700 a year on oil,” she says. “I’m left wondering if anyone is going to deliver to me and, if they do, how much will it cost.” Rob Sutherland, who lives in Drumnadrochit, not far from Inverness, contacted Guardian Money this week to warn that the price of heating oil was set to leave vast areas of the country living in poverty. “We keep hearing about gas prices and increases to the pricing caps, yet we living in rural areas are not protected due to not being on the gas grid. The reality of oil-fired boilers is £1.35-a-litre prices and a cost of nearly £2,000 to fill a fairly modest tank, which may last three or four months. Add on our utterly terrifying road fuel costs, and there is going to be an almighty impact which affects the most remote areas profoundly,” he says. Ken Cronin, who runs the UK and Ireland Fuel Distributors Association, says suppliers have been doing their best in very difficult circumstances. “UKIFDA members collect heating oil from refineries almost daily, and in the first 10 days, prices were increasing on average by 5p per litre per day. Currently, prices are lower but remain volatile. As an industry, we recognise the significant impact this has on customers, and our members are working hard to provide the best service and price under the circumstances.” BoilerJuice’s Tim Buckman told Guardian Money that oil suppliers and customers were facing disruption because of the significant fluctuations in oil prices, with “delays, a lack of availability and, in rare instances, cancellation and price changes”. He says: “We are doing all we can liaising with suppliers and customers to support them during this very challenging time.”",Lifestyle/Money,Britons in rural areas face crisis as heating oil prices more than triple,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/19/britons-in-rural-areas-face-crisis-as-heating-oil-prices-more-than-triple
3/19/2022,"The Nasa administrator, Bill Nelson, has played down hostile comments by the head of the Russian space agency, after Russia said it would stop supplying rocket engines to US companies. “That’s just Dmitry Rogozin,” Nelson told the Associated Press. “He spouts off every now and then. But at the end of the day, he’s worked with us. “The other people that work in the Russian civilian space program, they’re professional. They don’t miss a beat with us, American astronauts and American mission control.” The Russian invasion has resulted in canceled launches and broken contracts. Many worry Rogozin is putting decades of work at risk, most notably regarding the International Space Station. Besides threatening to pull out of the space station and drop it on the US, Europe or elsewhere, Rogozin had the flags of other countries covered on a Soyuz rocket awaiting liftoff with internet satellites. The launch was called off after the customer, London-based OneWeb, refused Rogozin’s demand that the satellites not be used for military purposes and the British government halt financial backing. On Thursday, the European Space Agency confirmed that it was indefinitely suspending its ExoMars rover mission with Roscosmos because of the war in Ukraine. “Despite all of that, up in space, we can have a cooperation with our Russian friends, our colleagues,” Nelson said. “The professional relationship between astronauts and cosmonauts, it hasn’t missed a beat. This is the cooperation we have going on in the civilian space program.” The US and Russia are the prime operators of the space station, which has been occupied for 21 years. Until SpaceX started launching astronauts in 2020, Americans hitched rides on Russian Soyuz capsules for tens of millions of dollars a seat. The US and Russian space agencies are still working on a system in which a Russian would launch on a SpaceX capsule beginning this fall and an American would fly on the Soyuz, helping ensure a US and Russian station presence at all times. The Nasa astronaut, Mark Vande Hei, who on Tuesday broke the US single spaceflight record of 340 days, is due to leave the space station with two Russians onboard a Soyuz capsule for a touchdown in Kazakhstan on 30 March. Nasa has said Vande Hei’s plans remain unchanged, despite a video in early March allegedly produced by Roscosmos that showed two Russian cosmonauts waving him goodbye. It then showed a mission control team watching a computer-generated video of the Russian segment of the station detaching and floating away. The video, which includes a Russian song titled Farewell, was shared by the news agency RIA Novosti. Its caption read: “The Roscosmos television studio jokingly demonstrated the possibility of Russia withdrawing from the ISS project – the undocking of the Russian segment of the station, without which the American part of the project cannot exist.” In a response, the Russian state news agency Tass said, “American astronaut Mark Vande Hei will return to Earth on 30 March onboard the Russian Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft, together with Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov … Roscosmos has never given reason to doubt its reliability as a partner.” Earlier in May, Rogozin shared a video showing an American flag being removed from a Russian rocket. “The launchers at Baikonur decided that without the flags of some countries, our rocket would look more beautiful,” he said. A retired American astronaut, Scott Kelly, pushed back, tweeting: “Your space program won’t be worth a damn. Maybe you can find a job at McDonald’s if McDonald’s still exists in Russia.” In a since deleted tweet, Rogozin wrote: “Get off, you moron! The death of the International Space Station will be on your conscience.” The Associated Press contributed to this report",News/Science,‘That’s just Dmitry’: Nasa plays down threat to ISS amid Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/19/nasa-iss-ukraine-war-russia-cooperation
3/19/2022,"To save energy, I like to soak and cook a big batch of pulses in the pressure cooker for the week ahead, to provide an economical foundation for our daily meals. But by the end of the week, especially if plans have changed, we might be left with a lot to use up. (The same goes for tinned beans: if only part of a tin is needed for a particular dish, we need to find a use for the rest.) Any beans make a great puree, or “hummus”, simply by whizzing them up and seasoning with sea salt. Or take them up a notch by mixing in extra-virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice or a splash of vinegar; tahini, garlic (in sparing amounts) and other flavourful ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, roast peppers and herbs also make great additions. Use the leftover aquafaba, or bean water, meanwhile (be it from the cooking pot or the tin), to thin the puree; it’s also a great nutritious stock for sauces and stews. Hummus means chickpea in Arabic, so any other blended pulse doesn’t quite stand up to the name. That said, “bean puree” doesn’t have quite the same ring to it, so I’m going to use artistic licence here. The aquafaba, meanwhile, will not only add flavour to the mix, it will also reduce the need to thin it with other liquids such as olive oil or water, so always reserve it with this in mind, or use it as an egg replacement in the likes of mayonnaise. 120g cooked beans (borlotti, cannellini, butter, adzuki, etc)2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilSea salt Optional extrasLemon juice, cider vinegar, crushed garlic and/or tahini, all to taste Optional toppingsExtra-virgin olive oil, dukkah, za’atar, toasted seeds, crushed nuts and/or fresh or dried herbs, all to taste Put the cooked beans and oil in a blender with any extra optional ingredients you fancy: I like to add a squeeze of lemon or dash of cider vinegar, a little crushed garlic and maybe a spoon of tahini.

3/19/2022,"Pavlo Kuzmenko, a surgeon by profession and the mayor of Okhtyrka by appointment, offered a rough tally as he drove through the streets of his city, passing one ruined house after another. Not that long ago potholes were among his biggest headaches. “Six people were killed here,” he said. “Three people there.” He preferred not to offer an overall death toll so as “not to frighten the citizens”. That number could be told “after the victory”, he said. Despite the mayor’s conviction, victory appears as far off as the peace that Okhtyrka enjoyed less than a month ago. Before the Russian onslaught began, Okhtyrka, which sits in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region, was a small, bustling city that was home to about 48,000 people. Today, after three weeks of almost daily bombing, it is a flame-licked, smoke-choked and rubble-strewn shadow of the place it once was. More than half Okhtyrka’s population have fled, and reports that it has been razed are hardly fanciful. The train station is gone, pummelled with an explosive ferocity that has flipped over some of the heavy freight wagons. Gone too are the town hall, a shopping centre and a local cultural centre. A single bomb managed to obliterate three houses and destroy the windows and balconies of a pair of nine-storey buildings 100 metres away. A large crater has been gouged in the ground, and a persistent smoke rises from the splintered wood and atomised masonry spewed on to the streets. “Two elderly ladies died in these houses today,” said Kuzmenko, pointing to the results of the latest Russian strike. More bodies could lie in the debris. “Look around, this is a residential area. There’s no military facility nearby, just a small river and a forest.” For all the talk and predictions of cyberwarfare and disinformation that followed the last Russian invasion in 2014, Putin’s latest war is an old-fashioned one of maps, battles and massive civilian suffering. Okhtyrka’s thermal power station, which was taken out not by a cyber-attack but by a bomb, has been partially repaired, but people are struggling – especially when temperatures drop to -12C at night. Many women took their children and left during the first few days. But many people remained, among them elderly people who have nowhere to go and do not want to leave their homes. The mayor’s professional training has proved invaluable. “I operated myself in the first days, when there were many victims,” Kuzmenko said. “I do complex operations. It’s completely different compared to peacetime. We have been preparing for some injuries from miles and explosions, but studying theory and practising are different things.” But why Okhtyrka? Looking around, it’s hard to fathom what could have made this small city such a target, and why at least 100 civilians appear to have been killed. “It’s because Okhtyrka did not surrender, and did not greet the Russians with flowers,” Kuzmenko said. The mayor said he had spoken to Russian prisoners of war who confessed that they had expected to be in Kyiv within two days. Okhtyrka also has an ineluctable geographical and strategic importance. It lies in the middle of a triangle that can be drawn between three regional centres – Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava – and is just 37 miles from the Russian border. Had the Russian troops occupied it straight away, the road to Poltava would have been opened and Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, cut off from the capital. What’s more, Okhtyrka produces 50% of Ukraine’s oil, hence the shelling of its oil depository. New but already familiar routines are emerging amid the bombardment. When they are not hiding in the basement of a kindergarten, a team of residents set about clearing the debris. People no longer rush for cover when they hear the distant detonations. They know the most dangerous attacks take place when it is dark. In daylight, the Ukrainian forces who control Okhtyrka can pinpoint sources of fire and shoot back. Without being on the ground, forensic experts are reluctant to identify the type of weaponry that is being used in an indiscriminate attempt to destroy Okhtyrka piece by piece. But the Ukrainian military suggest it could include Tochka-U missiles and rockets. According to Amnesty International, an attack on an Okhtyrka kindergarten on 25 February – which killed three people, including a child, as they sought shelter – involved widely banned cluster munitions from a 220mm Uragan rocket. “This is from a BM-27 Uragan multiple rocket launcher system,” said Vlad, a Ukrainian soldier, as he examined the debris at the kindergarten. The Kremlin claims it was attacking a military target. But Amnesty says the strike may constitute a war crime. “I live next to the kindergarten which was shelled,” said Halyna, a laboratory assistant. “I saw the blood near the entrance to my house. It’s scary.” On the 19th day of the bombing, her youngest boy would not stop screaming and crying. “My son survived a clinical death a year ago – I pulled him out of a coma,” she said. “And my daughter has a stent in her kidney. I didn’t save my children only to lose them now.” But she had decided she and her children must stay in Okhtyrka so she can help those in need. She juggles the volunteering with going to funerals of people she knew. “Serhiy was a piano turner, I was at his funeral today,” she said. “But I don’t want to talk more about death. It’s very difficult.” The mayor, who is in his 40s, had just buried a friend he had known for 15 years. “Unfortunately, we have funerals every day,” he said. “We do not have time to honour our people properly. They are buried quickly. Many civilians die. The Russians thought that people would say ‘Putin, help!’, but we say ‘Putin, die!’.” Vlad the soldier said proudly that opposition in and around Okhyrka had helped slow the Russian invasion in its first hours. “They didn’t expect it. We destroyed them.” But taking the city still matters to the Russians. And if they can’t occupy it, they may choose to flatten it. Kuzmenko, who was elected a year and a half ago, had intended to focus on Okhyrka’s renovation and on sorting out the holes in its poor roads. Now he was examining bomb craters and dispatching people to risk their lives as they tried to repair gas, water and power supplies under heavy fire. “Okhtyrka is the frontier between civilised and uncivilised worlds. It’s us who are stopping this criminal advance,” he said. His crater-side pleas were familiar. Ukraine’s skies needed to be closed off and the 1994 Budapest memorandum – under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in return for security assurance from Russia, the US and the UK – needed to be upheld, he said. He was not asking for humanitarian aid: Ukrainians could look after themselves, he said. “Install a no-fly zone,” the mayor insisted, admitting he had not been precisely sure what that entailed until a month ago. This was not about international security, he said, it was about protecting his people. Curfew was approaching but there was still time for a few more stops on the tour. As we moved from site to site, the mayor allowed himself glimpses of how Okhtyrka would look “after the victory”. In the ruins of the railway station, he envisioned a splendid new building made of glass. In spite of the ceaseless bombing, the deaths and the daily funerals, Kuzmenko was not the only one looking past the debris of the present and towards a phoenix-like future for Okhtyrka. When would the war be over, we asked Halyna, the lab assistant. “Honestly, I believe that when the tulips bloom, the war will end. I believe it,” she said. “I see how the town is dying in front of our eyes, but we’re young, and those who have left will return to rebuild it. Our dear Okhtyrka will stand, and our Ukraine will last. We will welcome spring with joy. We will go to our beaches. We will take a rest in our green meadows and hills. We will enjoy the beauty here.” Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist and the director of Public Interest Journalism Lab ",News/World news,‘After the victory’: ruined city of Okhtyrka clings to hope of brighter future,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/after-the-victory-ruined-city-of-okhtyrka-clings-to-hope-of-brighter-future
3/19/2022,"Yevgeny Chichvarkin, the multimillionaire owner of the Michelin-starred Mayfair restaurant Hide, was walking through Belgravia on Monday when he came across the mansion of another super-rich Russian that had been occupied by protesters demonstrating against the invasion of Ukraine. Although Chichvarkin, 47, is a longtime vocal critic of Vladimir Putin, he was alarmed by the squatters’ occupation of the £50m property owned by the oligarch Oleg Deripaska, describing their action as “a dirty game”. “To stop the war it will be helpful to send Javelins [a weapon system] and anti-tank missiles to Ukraine,” he said, adding that he supported a Nato no-fly zone over the country. “But to seize expensive ships or expensive houses, it’s a play for the next election by leftwing people. It’s a dirty, dirty game.” Chichvarkin, who also owns the luxury wine store Hedonism, is one of a group of high-profile exiled Russian public figures, including the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who last month founded an anti-war committee to hold Putin and other regime officials accountable for violations of international law. He and his partner, Tatiana Fokina, have attended anti-war protests in London with their six-year-old daughter, Alice, and earlier this month he delivered a lorryload of medicine to Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw. He described the pain he felt for Ukraine and Russia as “like two bullets in one heart”. But like several Russians I spoke to in Mayfair, Chichvarkin, who fled Moscow in 2008 claiming he was forced out by demands from corrupt officials to pay bribes, is perturbed by calls from some UK politicians, including government ministers, to seize oligarchs’ assets, including mansions, yachts and private jets. “There is a lot of alarmism in the press,” he said. “People with a low education and leftwing [views] who feel jealous to see the cars, beautiful houses and yachts. [It’s] so easy to play with their feelings about equality.” Chichvarkin said he supported seizing corrupt assets but only if it was done with respect for due process. “It has to be the decision of the high court. That’s why we respect [the] United Kingdom.” It was a sentiment echoed by Fokina, 34, in the dimly lit basement bar of the Hide on the night the police arrested the Belgravia squatters. “There’s lots of tainted Russian money [in London], but, also, there are so many political Russian refugees with money. I know so many very wealthy people who are now donating incredible amounts to Ukraine, and their accounts are being frozen.” Fokina fears that indiscriminate sanctions and cultural boycotts of Russian music play into the hands of Putin’s propagandists. “Every case of Russophobia in Europe, they are blowing up to a huge scale, saying no one will be glad to see you there,” she said. Although she has not been personally targeted, Fokina said some friends had been affected. “My friend’s five-year-old came back home and said: ‘Mummy, why are you killing people?’” Fokina, whose mother has fled to London because of the war, described her mixture of shock, despair and guilt in reaction to the invasion. “I can’t bear to look into the eyes of my Ukrainian friends because I feel profoundly ashamed, [even though] I’ve been in opposition to the current regime from a very young age. I think the best way someone’s put it is that all of a sudden you feel both like the Nazis and the Jews.” Natasha (not her real name), a Jewish Russian emigrant who has lived in London for 30 years, said she was shocked by the number of Russians back home who support Putin. The 50-year-old blamed this on state propaganda that portrays the conflict as a “saintly war against Nazis”. “It’s just been surreal,” she said. “It’s like some kind of parallel reality.” Natasha, who works as a concierge manager for the super-rich, said sanctions had affected the children of her wealthy Russian clients who were studying at British boarding schools. She acts as a guardian for three teenage boys, one of whom has asked to borrow money from her because the bank card given to him by his parents for his pocket money had been cut off. “These kids now they’re basically stranded,” she said. “It’s not fair.” Pytor (not his real name), a trader and investment banker who also joined the table at the Hide bar, said he was angry that sanctions were affecting people who had nothing to do with the war. The 46-year-old, who moved to London three years ago, argued that the west had breached the balance of power with Russia through the expansion of Nato and the European Union. Although he said there was no justification for the invasion, Pytor said he had lost faith in the western media because he saw its coverage of the conflict as too biased. “I’ve been very disappointed by the level of political propaganda and fierce hatred against Russia.” Victor Balagadde, a former editorial director for the Russian newspaper Kommersant, said he thought Pytor’s position was closest to that of the average Russian living in London. “You could see that through the social networks when the war started,” said Balagadde, 50, who lived in Kharkiv for 12 years and opposes the war. “They were more concerned not about people dying in Ukraine but about the sanctions which were imposed on Russia. It has been really hard to hear that.” Chichvarkin said some wealthy Russians in one of his WhatsApp groups were hostile towards discussion of the invasion. “They said: come on guys, it’s not a war chat, let’s be very polite and calm down. And another guy said: yeah, look at the banks, shut up with your war. And I left this group and I said: ‘Fuck all of you guys with no politics. Politics will come to you soon.’”",News/UK news,‘A dirty game’: Russians in UK rail at calls to seize oligarchs’ assets,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/19/a-dirty-game-russians-in-uk-rail-at-calls-to-seize-oligarchs-assets
