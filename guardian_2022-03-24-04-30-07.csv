3/24/2022,"On 6 October 2020, a mysterious buyer paid a record-breaking $31.8m for the famous Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton known as Stan. The rare, mostly complete skeleton of the dinosaur quickly vanished from the public eye. Paleontologists were left worried that the auction sale to a secret buyer would drive up the cost of rare skeletons, price out smaller museums and deny researchers – and the public – access to them. One and a half years later, the buyer has finally been unmasked. Using American trade records, National Geographic magazine tracked the 5.6 ton shipment in May 2021 from New York to the United Arab Emirates. The mystery was solved: Stan was headed to Abu Dhabi, to be put on display in the city’s future natural history museum, a 377,000 sq ft project currently under construction on Saadiyat Island, an upscale arts district in the capital. The Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi, slated for completion in 2025, will “feature some of the rarest wonders of natural history ever found,” according to a press release from Abu Dhabi’s department of culture and tourism. The museum told National Geographic that it would build and run a research facility with a focus on zoology, paleontology, marine biology, earth sciences and molecular research. In addition to the 39ft-long and 67-million-year-old skeleton, the museum will also feature a fragment of the Murchison meteorite, a carbon-rich meteorite that disintegrated in 1969 above Australia. Containing organic “stardust” compounds as well as seven-billion-year old presolar grains that formed before the sun, the meteorite fascinated researchers for decades. In a statement, Mohamed Khalifa al Mubarak, the chairman of Abu Dhabi’s culture and tourism department, said, “Natural history has a new home here in Abu Dhabi, and we will tell the story of our universe through some of the most incredible specimens known to mankind.” “These are rare gifts from nature that we are proud to protect and share with the world,” he added. As one of the world’s most famous and extensively studied skeletons, Stan was dug up in 1992 on private land in South Dakota. For more than 20 years, the fossil was protected and studied at the private Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in South Dakota. Over the years, Black Hills Institute made hundreds of replicas of Stan that were displayed globally in museums and in the homes of celebrities, including that of actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. However, after a legal conflict between brothers Pete and Neal Larson, two of the institute’s largest shareholders, a judge ordered Stan’s sale in 2018, prompting the most expensive auction for a fossil of any creature at Christie’s New York. After the famous skeleton disappeared into the hands of its private buyer, paleontologists grew concerned that the hefty price tag would further drive the illegal fossil trade, and prevent museums with smaller budgets from obtaining specimens for research and display. Others, according to National Geographic, worried that Stan’s auction could increasingly limit research on private land in the US if more landowners choose to publicly sell fossils. However, upon hearing the announcement of Stan’s new home, many paleontologists were relieved. Lindsay Zanno, a paleontologist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, told National Geographic, “If Stan can inspire a new generation to protect the past and lean into conserving our planet’s biodiversity in the future, that’s what I call a happy ending.” David Evans, a paleontologist at Toronto’s Royal Ontario Museum, said that if Stan is a permanent part of the Abu Dhabi museum’s collection and not just a temporary loan from a private collector, then his skeleton could “grow scientific interest in dinosaurs in a part of the world that has big potential for new fossil discoveries”.",News/Science,Mystery owner of Stan the T rex finally revealed following $31.8m auction,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/23/mystery-owner-of-stan-the-t-rex-finally-revealed-following-318m-auction
3/24/2022,"The Alabama Republican congressman Mo Brooks said on Tuesday that Donald Trump asked him to “rescind” the 2020 election, remove Joe Biden from the White House and reinstate Trump. The extraordinary statement came in an angry response to a withdrawn endorsement by the former president. Trump had been angered that Brooks was insufficiently toeing his line on calling the 2020 election a fraud. Brooks’ statement on Trump’s demands is now likely to be of interest to the January 6 committee. That panel is investigating Trump’s lie about electoral fraud in his defeat by Biden, efforts to marshal members of Congress to object to election results, a rally near the White House on 6 January 2021 which Trump and Brooks addressed, and the deadly attack on the US Capitol that followed. On Wednesday, after Trump withdrew his endorsement, Brooks said he was still in the race as the only true Trumpist candidate. He also claimed to have known he risked losing the former president’s endorsement by telling him “the truth”, and added: “I repeat what has prompted President Trump’s ire.” “The only legal way America can prevent 2020’s election debacle is for patriotic Americans to focus on and win the 2022 and 2024 elections so that we have the power to enact laws that will give us honest and accurate elections.” He then added: “President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency.” “As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that 6 January was the final election contest verdict and neither the US constitution nor the US Code [the laws of the United States] permit what President Trump asks. Period.” Brooks also said “I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the US constitution”, an oath he said he would “break … for no man”. However, Brooks has until now been one of Trump’s most ardent supporters, including on and around the events of January 6. Addressing the “Stop the Steal” rally at the Ellipse in Washington DC that day, Brooks said: “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass. “Now, our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives … Are you willing to do the same? My answer is yes. Louder! Are you willing to do what it takes to fight for America?” Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” to stop the certification of election results. According to a bipartisan Senate report, seven deaths were linked to the riot that followed. Nearly 800 people have been charged, some with seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted when enough Republican senators stayed loyal. In the aftermath of the riot, Brooks was the first of 147 Republican members of Congress to vote against certifying election results. His role in the “Stop the Steal” movement has been under scrutiny ever since. Multiple reporters have placed Brooks with other far-right Republicans including Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Jim Jordan of Ohio in White House meetings with Trump. An organiser of the 6 January rally, the convicted felon Ally Alexander, has named Brooks and two Arizona Republicans, Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs, as members of Congress who helped plan the event. Brooks said he spoke at the invitation of the Trump White House and had no recollection of communicating with Alexander. He has also confirmed that he wore body armour while giving his speech. The January 6 committee has been weighing whether to seek to compel Brooks to testify. A Democratic congressman, Eric Swalwell of California, sued Brooks, Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Rudy Giuliani for violating federal civil rights law and local incitement law. In February, a federal judge said he would dismiss Brooks, Giuliani and Trump Jr from the case, because their speeches were political and thus protected by the first amendment. Brooks is running for US Senate in Alabama, his campaign featuring warnings of “dictatorial socialism and its threat to liberty, freedom and the very fabric of American society”. He had attracted Trump’s endorsement. But in a statement on Wednesday, Trump said: “Mo Brooks of Alabama made a horrible mistake recently when he went ‘woke’ and stated, referring to the 2020 Presidential Election Scam, ‘Put that behind you, put that behind you.’ “When I heard this statement, I said, ‘Mo, you just blew the election, and there’s nothing you can do about it.’” In response, Brooks accused Trump of being “manipulated” by Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. McConnell and Trump have split since January 6, after which McConnell voted to acquit Trump at trial but also excoriated him in a speech on the Senate floor. The Republican establishment reportedly fears that extreme pro-Trump candidates could jeopardise the party’s chances of retaking the Senate this year. A model for such a catastrophe exists in Alabama, where in 2017 an extremist, Roy Moore, was beaten by the Democrat Doug Jones in a special election. Brooks has however fallen behind in polling and fundraising.

3/24/2022,"The US supreme court threw out Wisconsin’s new state legislative maps on Wednesday, in a ruling that boosts Republicans and takes aim again at one of the last remaining provisions to protect voting discrimination. The ruling is the latest of many in recent years in which the US supreme court has been hostile to voting rights. In an unsigned ruling, the court took issue with the decision to add an additional Black-majority state assembly district in the Milwaukee area, raising the total in the map to seven. The Wisconsin supreme court picked the plan, drawn by Tony Evers, the state’s Democratic governor, earlier this month. The state court had taken over the redistricting process after Evers and the GOP-controlled state legislature failed to agree on a plan. The Wisconsin legislature is heavily distorted in favor of Republicans and it is one of the most gerrymandered bodies in the country. It is virtually impossible for Democrats to win a majority under the current lines. Last year, the state supreme court gave Republicans a boost when they announced they would pick a map that made the least change from the current ones. The court picked Evers’ map earlier this month from a range of submitted proposals, saying it complied with its directive to make the least possible change. It gave Democrats one of the best possible outcomes, even though Republicans still would hold their majority. State Republicans asked the US supreme court to step in anyway. Now, the US supreme court has sent the case back to the Wisconsin supreme court for further evaluation of the different plans before it. The US supreme court on Wednesday also declined to overturn new congressional districts picked by the state supreme court. The US supreme court’s opinion said that the state court committed a “legal error” in picking the plan and didn’t appropriately follow the required process to justify the creation of a new district. “[The governor’s] main explanation for drawing the seventh majority-Black district was that there is now a sufficiently large and compact population of Black residents to fill it – apparently embracing just the sort of uncritical majority-minority district maximization that we have expressly rejected,” the US supreme court wrote. “He provided almost no other evidence or analysis supporting his claim that the VRA required the seven majority-Black districts that he drew.” The Wisconsin supreme court also failed to meet several tests to determine whether the addition of another Black-majority district was required and justified under the voting rights act, the court wrote. “The question that our VRA precedents ask and the court failed to answer is whether a race-neutral alternative that did not add a seventh majority-Black district would deny Black voters equal political opportunity,” the court said. The US supreme court’s ruling on Wednesday was “unprecedented”, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan said in a dissenting opinion. Writing for the pair, Sotomayor noted that the majority had used an emergency ruling to settle issues of uncertain precedent. She noted that the parties in the case did not dispute several of the tests that require the creation of an additional Black-majority district were met. And she pointed out that the Wisconsin supreme court had left open the possibility for resolving several of the issues the supreme court took issue in later litigation. “Our precedents offer no clear answers to the question whose motives should be analyzed in these circumstances (the four justices who selected the map based on the ‘least change’ criteria, the governor, or some combination) or how. The court does not purport to answer this question,” she wrote. “This court’s intervention today is not only extraordinary but also unnecessary. The Wisconsin supreme court rightly preserved the possibility that an appropriate plaintiff could bring an equal protection or VRA challenge in the proper forum. I would allow that process to unfold, rather than further complicating these proceedings with legal confusion.” The court’s decision on Wednesday falls into a series of cases recently where it has either raised the threshold – or indicated it is interested in raising the threshold – for challenging laws under section two of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws racially discriminatory voting practices. Richard Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said the supreme court’s ruling in the Wisconsin case was “bizarre”. “The state supreme court did not purport do to a full VRA analysis: it was adopting maps, and those maps could have been challenged later on VRA or equal protection grounds,” he wrote in a blogpost. “The court used a case in an emergency procedural posture to reach out and decide an issue that could have waited for full briefing and argument either in a lower court in a challenge to the maps or if the supreme court had set the case for argument. “It decided these issues in ways hostile to minority voting rights without giving a full opportunity for airing out the issues and pointing out how this will further hurt voters of color.” In February, the US supreme court overturned a court-imposed congressional map in Alabama that would have added another Black-majority congressional district. At the time, it said that Alabama’s 24 May primary elections were too close to impose new maps. Earlier this month, it declined to step in and block new districts in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, but three justices indicated they do not believe state supreme courts can override state legislatures when it comes to redistricting.",News/US news,US supreme court blocks new Wisconsin voting maps in boost for Republicans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/supreme-court-wisconsin-voting-maps-republicans
3/24/2022,"Campaigners have called for discussion of transgender rights to focus on respect, generosity and the elimination of prejudice after the prime minister stated that “basic facts of biology remain overwhelmingly important”. At Wednesday’s PMQs, Boris Johnson told MPs that “we must recognise when people want to make a transition in their lives that they should be treated with the maximum possible generosity and respect” but added “when it comes to distinguishing between man and woman, the basic facts of biology remain overwhelmingly important”. Johnson was responding to a question from Angela Richardson about the interim report of the Cass Review into gender identity services for young people in England and Wales, which raised serious concerns about the lack of data collection on outcomes for the recent increase in young females questioning their gender identity. On Tuesday, the UK government announced that it was planning a comprehensive cross-government strategy to “advance” the rights of the LGBT+ community, covering healthcare, sex work, veterans and homelessness. Johnson’s remarks, which reference the argument that sex-based rights should not be eroded by those based on gender identity, stand in contrast to those of the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who recently stated that “trans women are women”. When asked to define a woman in a recent interview with The Times, Starmer replied: “A woman is a female adult, and in addition to that trans women are women, and that is not just my view – that is actually the law.” Responding to Johnson’s remarks, a spokesperson for Stonewall said: “Trans people currently find themselves the subject of much debate, but what is evident and inarguable is that trans people exist. And their existence shows us that human lives and experiences cannot always be sorted into neat little boxes. “We know that most people share our goal of a world where everyone is safe and free to be ourselves. Supporting lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer people to live freely and fulfil our potential means tackling the prejudices and stereotypes that hold so many more people back.” Kai O’Doherty, head of policy and research at Mermaids, the charity supporting transgender youth, said that Johnson’s remarks should not be taken out of context. “We were pleased to see the PM’s answer today included an important emphasis on ensuring we treat trans people with respect and generosity and that his latter comments were distinctly made within this context. We believe it is in everyone’s interest to not attach so much weight to biology when discussing trans matters. Sex rights and trans rights are not at odds with one another.” Groups campaigning for women’s sex-based rights welcomed Johnson’s remarks. Fair Play For Women described it as a “clear commonsense answer” while Lesbian Labour tweeted “whilst the Tories remain better on this issue Labour will not win an election”. Finn Mackay, the sociologist and author of Female Masculinities and the Gender Wars, argues that while biology is important, so are laws to recognise and protect identities. “Also there’s the issue that our biology, if he means genitals and reproductive systems, aren’t visible most of the time. So biology isn’t always the most useful; I’m called ‘young man’ regularly, I’m not young or male.”",News/Society,Call for respect for trans rights after Johnson says biology ‘overwhelmingly important’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/23/call-for-respect-for-trans-rights-after-boris-johnson-says-biology-overwhelmingly-important
3/24/2022,"“The fuel duty cut is welcome but there’s not really anything else,” said 61-year-old Susan Lee, from Bath, who retired early on medical grounds. “I wasn’t asking for anything extra, just for benefits to have parity with inflation, but we haven’t even got that.” Lee, who worked as a nurse for 34 years, developed rheumatoid arthritis and now suffers from nerve damage in both her legs. She said there was a “flicker of hope that something would be announced but there’s absolutely nothing”. Her income is made up of three monthly payments: £390 for her NHS pension for ill health retirement, £350 for Pip and £450 for ESA. She has a Motability car which “is her “legs” but she has had to ration essential journeys owing to high fuel prices. The “biggest impact” of the cost of living crisis for her has been losing her carer. “She used to come in for around two hours a week for £22.50 per hour but I had to stop her coming altogether in February following the chancellor’s announcement about energy bills,” said Lee. “This crisis means having to make real life decisions. I’ve economised wherever and however I can but later in the year I’m going to have to decide which one I pay for – energy or rent?” “I’m disappointed but not surprised,” said Emily Pritchard, a 25-year-old bookseller living in Oxford, who moved back to her parents’ home about a year ago following a breakup. “The fuel duty cut doesn’t affect me and others who don’t have cars, and the income tax which is coming in 2024 – I don’t see how that’s helpful to anyone when people are struggling now. It’s just endless disappointment.” Although she had only planned to stay with her parents for six months, she is now unsure when she will leave. Her uncertainty about moving out has partly been fuelled by the rising energy costs and the broader cost of living crisis. “I was planning to stay for maybe six months and use it as a jumping-off point into the next stage of my life, but instead it has become the next stage of my life,” Pritchard says. She says she’d be more likely to have moved out if she were on a higher salary, and explains that if she was living in a flatshare money would be tight. At the moment, she doesn’t “quite run out of money by the end of the month”. “It’s fairly close, but [I don’t] have to really worry about it in the same way.” Pritchard, who contributes money for food and bills to her parents, did not expect to be living at home in her mid-20s. “I do feel some shame and embarrassment about living at my parents’, but the actual circumstances work pretty well for all of us, for now.” Retired electrician and accountant Paul Aspinall is also “very disappointed” by the spring statement. “The fuel duty cut only takes off around £4 when filling up,” said the 67-year-old from South Staffordshire. “If I have a pint once a week that’s gone – or even buying a few packets of pasta. “Increasing the national insurance threshold will help but maybe the money could’ve been used for those on the lowest end of the pay scale. And the income tax rise isn’t even worth talking about when it’s two years down the line.” His income is about £1,500 a month, which includes his state pension, a private pension and a small income from a bungalow which he rents out. Aspinall said he’s noticed that prices for everything from food to energy have gone up quite a bit. “A jar of Bovril two months ago was £3.50 but now it’s £4.” “Energy costs are phenomenal,” Aspinall added. As a dual-fuel customer with Octopus Energy, he paid £106.22 a month in January with his payment for February rising to £153.09 – an increase of 44% – when his tariff changed due to his fixed-term contract coming to an end in February. “I don’t have the heating on for as long as I used to and I definitely wear more layers,” he said. “Life is not miserable and I see it as a bit of a challenge. I’m not giving in to it.” For 67-year-old Julie Kitchen, who lives in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, the statement was “very minor” and “rubbish”. “If you’re not a pensioner who drives, there’s nothing for you,” she said. “I was hoping he would bite into the energy companies but he hasn’t, and to not do anything with pension credit seems to give pensioners the message that they should just join the food bank queue.” In terms of the cut to VAT for energy-efficiency measures, Kitchen added: “I don’t think I could be any more energy efficient! At my time of life I’m not going to spend a huge amount of money putting in solar panels on my roof because I will never reap the benefits.” A retired information manager, Kitchen now lives off her state pension of £816 a month, a private pension of £389 a month and savings. One of her main expenses is travel – because of her rural location she drives when she has to. “Since Covid I haven’t been going out as much but I do like to occasionally go to Cardiff which is about 24-mile round trip. Public transport is terrible here – we only have one bus service which goes to Cardiff airport. There used to be an airport service which would take you into the city, which all the pensioners used to dive on, but that’s stopped now due to Covid.” Kitchen’s main concern is the cost of energy, which she said is a “biggie”. “I’ve been piling clothes on and wearing blankets but it’s starting to get silly. Financially, I’m fairly comfortable but it’s scary with energy prices at the moment. You used to be able to get good deals but now you can’t even do that.” Clare Evans, 38, a community worker with people with learning disabilities, said the spring statement was “no big surprise”. “I’m not going to complain about anything that benefits me, like the fuel duty cut or the national insurance threshold rise, however small. All those pennies add up. I’m very lucky I’ve got a good wage and I’m not in dire straits at the moment, but I work and support people who are, and I can’t see how any of this meaningfully helps them. “It’s very hard not to take it personally. We all know a lot about Rishi Sunak, his family and how wealthy they are. It smarts a little bit. I don’t really feel like anything’s changed since yesterday, but I guess I didn’t expect it to either.” Clare said she’s most worried about the people she meets through her work, most of whom live on disability benefits. “We can manage, but the individuals that I work with, they’re making those decisions about whether it’s warmth or food or access to transport. They’re having to limit everything that they’re doing. We can’t help everybody, but the question is are we helping the right people, because it doesn’t always feel like that.”",News/UK news,‘Energy or rent?’ Britons expect rising hardship after Sunak’s spring statement,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/energy-or-rent-britons-expect-rising-hardship-after-sunaks-spring-statement
3/24/2022,"An east London music venue as wide as the London Eye and as tall as Big Ben has been approved by planners, despite opposition from thousands of local people. The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) made the decision about the MSG Sphere, a live entertainment concept from New York’s Madison Square Garden (MSG) company, on Tuesday night. It would be built on an empty spot of land between Stratford station and the Olympic Park, but has not yet been approved by the mayor. The 21,500-capacity venue, reported to cost £800m, is designed for “the next generation of immersive experiences”. It would feature the biggest and highest-resolution LED screen in the world, an “infrasound haptic system” of vibrating floors, and “beamforming” audio technology to channel sound to every seat. The building’s facade is a spherical LED screen measuring two hectares (five acres). It’s expected to glow 24 hours a day and be covered with animated adverts for half the time, flickering right outside people’s bedroom windows. Inside, there will be restaurants and bars. If built, the MSG Sphere will become the largest concert arena in the UK, outstripping Manchester Arena (capacity 21,000) and London’s O2 Arena (20,000). The scheme’s supporters, including the University of East London and the former cabinet minister Matt Hancock, say it will boost the capital’s economy by £2.5bn, bringing construction and hospitality jobs to the area. Paul Westbury, from MSG, said the application had gone through a “thorough assessment” and that the venue would help make Stratford “a global destination for music and technology”, the Evening Standard reported. But local people say it will “blight the area” with noise and light pollution, and predict that it will be like “living next to the surface of the sun”. More than 1,000 people objected to the planning application, while a petition calling for the scheme to be scrapped received more than 2,000 signatures. Among those in opposition is Lyn Brown, the West Ham MP, who described the venue as a “monstrosity” and said it would pile pressure on the local transport network, particularly at Stratford station, which is already a hub for commuters to the Westfield shopping centre and West Ham’s 60,000-seater stadium. In a statement, she said: “The last thing we need is another venue disgorging its audience into an already overcrowded transport hub.” Writing in the Guardian last summer, Brown added: “I have had serious concerns for some time about the value of this proposed development, the degree of community consent it has involved and the harm it may do to people in Stratford and neighbouring areas. Newham doesn’t want this venue, yet it’s the LLDC, not Newham council, that gets to recommend to Sadiq Khan whether it is built.” An MSG Entertainment spokesperson said: “We are pleased that the planning committee voted in support of our vision for MSG Sphere. Throughout this process we have worked closely with a wide range of stakeholders, and are grateful for their collaboration, which is reflected in our detailed proposal. We now look forward to progressing on to the next steps in the approval process.” ",News/Society,London’s Madison Square Garden Sphere gets planning approval,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/23/londons-madison-square-garden-sphere-gets-planning-approval
3/24/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s spring statement is a strategy for inequality. The war in Ukraine and post-pandemic disorder have sent fuel and food prices soaring. The rise in inflation to a 40-year high is expected to reduce real household disposable incomes by 2.2% in 2022 – the biggest fall in living standards since records began in 1956. Energy bills could top £3,000 a year. Without help, warm homes and warm meals might become the preserve of the top half of British society. Yet the IPPR thinktank says that the poorest get just £120 help to offset rising costs in the spring statement, while the richest are given a £480 boost. The money was available to hand out. Economic growth meant the chancellor had almost £20bn of fiscal headroom within his self-imposed rules. By not uprating benefits or the state pension, which are only going up by 3.1% this month when inflation will be about 8%, Mr Sunak has delivered a big cut in living standards for the poor. As government department budgets are set in cash terms, higher inflation will mean either public servants like teachers taking large real pay cuts – politically difficult if private sector wages are rising more quickly – or cutting back on the services they provide. Mr Sunak should have at least reinstated the universal credit uplift of £20 a week and committed more cash for free school meals, rather than spend £10bn reducing government borrowing. Mr Sunak spent the other £10bn from his windfall on tax cuts – stung by Labour taunts over his “high tax policy”. The chancellor’s spring statement undid about a sixth of the overall net tax rises he has announced. Set against his own arguments, Mr Sunak’s national insurance cut makes no sense. For six months the chancellor insisted that he needed to raise £12bn to clear post-Covid NHS waiting lists via the national insurance paid by employees and employers. However, on Wednesday afternoon it appeared that Mr Sunak only needed £6bn for the health service, and he raised the threshold from which workers pay national insurance. This “tax cut” is skewed towards the wealthy – with only £1 in every £3 gained going to the bottom half of society. Finally, to make a mockery of the idea that taxation is needed to pay for essential public services, Mr Sunak proposed reducing the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19% from April 2024. The two changes wipe out the amount supposedly required to pay for health and social care. The chancellor’s reduction in petrol and diesel taxes by 5p a litre is free money to motorists in proportion to how much they drive and how fuel-inefficient their car is. It is also a highly unequal measure. A tax-cutting Conservative chancellor is unlikely to raise fuel duty, which has been frozen in real terms since 2010, ahead of an election. It would have been better to instead spend the £2.5bn cost of the policy on funding free or cheap public transport. Reducing government borrowing while letting the poor go cold and hungry is not good politics or good economics. Benefits are heading to their lowest level in real terms since 1985. Growth is set to fall. Rising inactivity rates mean that unemployment is closer to 6% than the official 3.9%. The standard of living will drop. Mr Sunak will never be able to cut government expenditure fast enough or raise taxes high enough to keep pace with the budgetary deficit due to the fall in economic output. The government’s policy will only lead to a progressive deterioration of the wellbeing of its citizens. The sooner Mr Sunak realises that he is out of touch with the public mood and reverses his economic policy, the better for the country.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Sunak’s spring statement: a big cut in living standards | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/23/the-guardian-view-on-sunaks-spring-statement-a-big-cut-in-living-standards
3/24/2022,"When 98% of the population is short of food, all that is left is hope. In Afghanistan there is not much of that either. On Wednesday, the Taliban abruptly reversed their decision to let girls return to secondary school; the last-minute chaos appears to reflect internal disagreements. Tears fell as pupils arrived in classrooms for the first time since the Taliban takeover last August, only for their dreams to be shattered once more. Taliban forces are carrying out revenge killings and threatening more. They are detaining and beating journalists and closing media outlets. They are harassing, assaulting and threatening lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Afghans. There are growing reports of detentions, rapes and killings of minorities, rights advocates and former officials. But Afghans’ struggle for their freedoms and rights comes alongside their struggle to survive. David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, warned earlier this year that hunger could kill more Afghans than war did over the past two decades. The US economic blockade of the new regime was a devastating blow that came on top of drought, the sudden withdrawal of the foreign aid on which the country long relied and Taliban incompetence. The easing of restrictions to allow humanitarian aid has been essential. The UK is cohosting a UN pledging conference later this month, seeking to raise $4.4bn (£3.3bn). But as the Afghanistan Analysts Network warned recently: “This is not an economic crisis that has mainly hit the poor and the vulnerable and it cannot be addressed by emergency food aid alone. At its most basic level, the economy needs its cash to flow again – salaries, bank assets, remittances – as soon as possible.” Humanitarian relief cannot substitute for a functioning economy, and it will not last for ever. The US approach has been like offering wood to patch one or two sections of crumbling floor while bulldozing the house’s foundations. It deserves no credit for offering to deliver some of Afghanistan’s frozen assets in the form of aid (while hiving off half, pending legal action by relatives of 9/11 victims). A recent move to allow commercial and financial transactions with Afghanistan, including the transfer of money to civil servants, is more promising. But it is only a beginning. The UK also has a moral debt. This week, a second Foreign Office whistleblower went public, saying it was “widespread knowledge” in government that Boris Johnson ordered the prioritisation of an animal charity for evacuation last summer. The prime minister has denied having anything to do with the decision for Nowzad to be allowed to evacuate staff and animals through Kabul airport. What is clear is that the government put the lives of animals, and staff whom it acknowledges were not extremely vulnerable, ahead of people known to be in severe danger.

She was 84 years-old. “We are heartbroken to announce that Dr Madeleine Albright, the 64th US secretary of state and the first woman to hold that position, passed away earlier today,” a statement posted on her Twitter account read. “The cause was cancer. She was surrounded by family and friends. We have lost a loving mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and friend.” Albright, born Marie Jana Korbelova, became the US’s top diplomat in 1996, and served during the last four years of Bill Clinton’s administration. She was the highest-ranking woman in the history of US government at that time. She was a young girl when her family fled Prague for London after the Nazis took Czechoslovakia in 1939. She was raised a Catholic, and only decades later discovered that her parents were Jewish and that several of her family members had been murdered in the Holocaust.

3/24/2022,"For Bonnie Norris, the tornadoes that tore through New Orleans on Tuesday evening seemed to come out of nowhere. She and her boyfriend were watching television when something outside caught their attention. Norris described the tornado as a black, spinning vortex. She said the noise was deafening, like a freight train. “I just remember saying, ‘Here it comes, here it comes.’” Jumping into action, Norris’s boyfriend suggested they take shelter in a closet, but at the last second, Norris said they should lie down in the bathtub. That decision may have saved both of their lives. Moments later, their home was demolished, caving in on top of them. “The tub is what saved us,” Norris said. “It was an all-surround tub and the roof came down in one piece. It protected us, and we were able to get out.” The two or more tornadoes that tore through the New Orleans metro region Tuesday evening killed at least two people and carved a swath of destruction in a region still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Ida last year. Norris lives on Patricia Street in Arabi, a small town in St Bernard parish, which borders New Orleans to the south-east. The twister that destroyed her home was spawned by the same system of severe thunderstorms that moved across the deep south and caused major damage in Texas, where the state’s governor declared a disaster in 16 counties. It’s believed to have formed over a New Orleans suburb before moving across the Mississippi River into the Lower Ninth Ward and then into St Bernard parish, both of which were some of the most heavily affected areas during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 that killed more than 1800 people. But Arabi appears to be the hardest hit by Tuesday’s tornado. Surveying the damage on Wednesday morning, Norris reflected on the pile of rubble that was once her home. “I moved here just over four years ago, and it’s been one traumatic thing after another,” she said. Six months ago, Hurricane Ida hit the region, 16 years to the day after Katrina. Norris said their home was still being repaired from damage caused by the category 4 hurricane. “We had roof damage for Ida and we were fighting with Fema about getting the roof fixed,” Norris said, fighting back tears. “Now I don’t know where we’re at.” Nearly every home in Norris’s neighborhood was either completely destroyed or heavily damaged by the tornado. None of them are habitable. Just a few houses down, her neighbor, Leslie Burt, lost her entire roof, and every window was blown out. She was on the phone with her uncle when the tornado hit her home. “It happened so fast,” Burt said. “I just saw through the windows it was spinning, I heard a train sound, and I grabbed by dogs and went to the bathroom.” A block over from Burt, Cheryl Danier’s home suffered extensive damage, with two-by-four planks sticking out of the walls and roof. “It was loud, very loud. The house was shaking and I could hear debris just hitting, hitting, hitting everywhere.” Danier’s house, built after her first home floated away in Katrina’s floodwaters, is still standing. She said she built her new home to be six feet off of the ground so it wouldn’t flood again. “I did that for the water,” Danier said with a small, pained laugh, “but I didn’t account for the wind. I didn’t plan on tornadoes.” While the region is more known for dealing with hurricanes, tornadoes aren’t entirely uncommon in New Orleans. But they seem to be getting more frequent – and more powerful. Tornadoes are rated using the Fujita scale and receive a rating of EF0 to EF5. The higher the number, the stronger the twister. Since 1950, there have been 21 total tornadoes in New Orleans and at least seven have touched down with a rating of EF2 or higher. The tornado that hit Arabi on Tuesday night was rated “at least” EF3, with the National Weather Service office in New Orleans issuing a preliminary rating. The last tornado rated higher than EF2 tore through swaths of eastern New Orleans in 2017, and the most recent one touched down in May last year. Tracking the storm on live television, meteorologist Margaret Orr pointed out the tornado just as it appeared on camera on Tuesday, and captured the sentiments of almost every New Orleanian. “There it is – you can see it,” she said. “Folks, this is something I hoped I would never see.”",News/US news,‘One traumatic thing after another’: New Orleans homes flattened by giant twisters,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/new-orleans-tornadoes-twisters-arabi-homes-destroyed
3/24/2022,"The best news (but, critically, still not good news) for hard-pressed energy consumers this week could be found away from the chancellor’s tweaks to national insurance thresholds on Wednesday. It was the calculation by the consultancy Cornwall Insight that the energy price cap may not hit £3,000 when next adjusted in October. The latest estimate, derived from observing wholesale prices for gas and electricity, is £2,512. There is no sense in which the £500-ish difference can be considered a saving, of course. An average bill for households of £2,500 or thereabouts would still be a mighty increase from the £1,971 that will apply from the start of next month, which itself is a jump from £1,277 today. Instead, the volatility in estimates is a reminder that a lot can happen in the course of a few weeks or months. Today’s wholesale energy prices look slightly less horrible than those of a couple of weeks ago, but the position can flip again. The “observation window” for the October price cap runs until the end of July. Thus Rishi Sunak’s measures for low-income households look little more than hopeful responses that could be overtaken by events. The relative value of a national insurance reform worth £330 a year for an average worker depends in large part on whether that worker’s household is facing an increase in energy costs of £700 or £1,500 or more in the next year. Cuts to fuel duty may help at the margin but could also be rendered irrelevant by market forces. Sunak, remember, unveiled his £9bn energy-specific package for consumers in January – so before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine created more market pressures – and the only directly related addition on Wednesday was an extra £500m for the household support fund, which is administered by local authorities. The chancellor trumpeted the sum as a doubling in resources, but it is a doubling from a low base. Instead of £1bn, several billions would be needed to put a meaningful dent in predicted levels of fuel poverty. For context, the Treasury saved £5bn a year when it cancelled the £20-a-week pandemic uplift in universal credit. It is a case of taking with one hand and giving back substantially less, in instalments, with the other. The bottom line is that, under all likely scenarios, millions of households will still face energy bills that are unaffordable and for which they could not reasonably have been expected to prepare. The open question for next winter is the degree of financial pain. If he really wished to show he was “standing by” low-income households, Sunak would have committed to reworking his models and being more generous if the energy storm takes a turn for the worse. He didn’t. In similar vein, the scrapping of 5% VAT on green home improvements such as solar panels, heat pumps and insulation products for the next five years looks a mere tweak. The marginal saving may incentivise a few households to commit to the investment, but not many, one suspects. An ambitious national energy-saving programme would involve serious tax breaks and subsidies, rather than modest VAT concessions. The last time the UK funded a serious insulation programme was back in 2012, before David Cameron decided to “cut the green crap”, including big incentives for home energy-efficiency improvements. Data from the Climate Change Committee shows that rates of insulation for cavity walls and lofts plunged in 2013 and have never recovered. The size of the opportunity has only been underlined by current energy prices and the need to reduce reliance on imports. Here, for example, is a startling calculation by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit: if all homes that have energy performance certificate band D were upgraded to band C, the UK’s total gas demand would fall by 7%, and imports by 15%. In other words, greater energy conservation looks the easiest win of all in the current crisis. One hopes the forthcoming review of energy policy will deliver something resembling a joined-up plan from the government. A VAT saving on a heat pump (sadly, still an untrusted piece of kit in the view of most consumers) is a nod in the right direction, but one cannot call it ambitious.",News/Business,Sunak’s spring measures for poorer households look little more than hopeful | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/23/sunak-spring-measures-households-energy-bills
3/24/2022,"Solar panels will be about £1,000 cheaper for households to install from April, the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, has announced, with the removal of VAT on green home-upgrade equipment. Heat pumps and energy efficiency materials will also benefit from the zero rating in a boost for clean energy generation. Heat pump installations will be about £500 cheaper as a result and the cost of installing cavity insulation will fall by about £190 and loft insulation by about £160 for the average household. But the measure was the only nod towards the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a mini budget that supported fossil fuels through a 5p cut in fuel duty, while doing little to relieve the high cost of energy for most households and businesses. Tellingly, Sunak failed even to mention the term “net zero” in his speech. Beyond the VAT cut, there was no other help for households seeking to reduce their energy bills through insulation or green energy. A boiler upgrade scheme, already announced, will provide grants of up to £5,000 for heat pumps from April but is set to benefit only 90,000 households in the next three years. Yet helping households with energy efficiency was the biggest step the chancellor could have taken to bring down bills, according to green campaigners. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at the thinktank E3G said: “The UK has the most energy-inefficient housing stock in western Europe and action to cut energy demand is the most effective way to bring down energy bills. The cut in VAT for retrofitting homes is welcome – it will boost the industry and make action to decarbonise homes more affordable. What is missing is more financial support for low-income households to insulate their homes.” The fuel duty cut would mainly benefit wealthy households and drivers of SUVs, noted Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK. “The fuel duty cut gives more money back to the driver of an expensive gas-guzzling SUV than the average punter. It doesn’t provide much help at all to the poorest fifth of the population, over half of whom don’t even have a car,” he said. As expected, Sunak also refused to place a windfall tax on fossil fuel producers, even though the world’s leading energy authority – the International Energy Agency, a body not noted for its radicalism – recommended such a measure. BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, has called his company a “cash machine” owing to the unexpected price rises, and his chief financial officer Murray Auchincloss said the company was possibly “getting more cash than we know what to do with”. Labour has estimated that a windfall tax would raise about £3bn, which could be recycled into helping poorer households with soaring energy bills. But although the tax would fall on companies rather than raising the tax burden for households, and is unlikely to raise the cost of fuel, the chancellor has steadfastly rejected such calls. Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s astonishing that the chancellor continues to allow fossil-fuel firms to rake in enormous profits while cash-strapped households struggle with their bills. A windfall tax on these companies could have funded energy efficiency and eased the burden on those most affected. The measures introduced today will only scratch the surface of what’s needed to help people save energy.” Sunak also rejected calls to reduce the price of public transport. According to pre-pandemic estimates, it would take about £3bn to make buses free and doing so would help the poorest, who are most reliant on public transport, as well as cutting car use, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Childs said: “Public transport must be rapidly expanded and made cheaper to encourage more people to leave the car at home, with particular focus on our woefully inadequate rural bus services.” There is still time for the government to come up with fresh measures to cut energy bills, help the most vulnerable and reduce the UK’s reliance on expensive fossil fuels. Sunak promised that “in the coming weeks” the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng would publish an energy security strategy, focusing on how the UK can ensure a stable energy supply despite shocks such as the soaring gas price, sanctions on Russian oil and gas, and other threats to supply following Russia’s war in Ukraine. Greenpeace’s Parr said that strategy would need substantial funding to be successful: “We need to see around £10bn of support, part raised by a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, for delivering the help families need to install the clean technologies that will get us off gas. That should include finally fulfilling the full Conservatives’ manifesto pledge of £9.2bn towards energy efficiency, with more support grants available and greater backing to help the industry train up and deploy the tens of thousands of jobs this area offers.”",News/Environment,Sunak’s statement only ‘scratches the surface’ on energy efficiency,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/sunaks-statement-only-scratches-the-surface-on-energy-efficiency
3/24/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s spring statement opened by summoning the power of free societies and open markets, as a counterpoint to Russian aggression in Ukraine. “What the authoritarian mind perceives as division, we know are the passionate disagreements at the heart of our living, breathing democracy,” he said. It was a Thatcherite rhetorical flourish aimed at stirring his supporters on the Conservativezx backbenches, but also framed the statement as a response to the war, which Sunak said had made the UK’s economy more fragile and underlined the need for “security” at home. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is now forecasting the steepest one-year decline in living standards since records began in the 1950s. So perhaps it should not be surprising that Sunak appeared keen to paint the hardship ahead as a contribution to the war effort rather than the result of deliberate political choices. He didn’t quite say the privations to be faced by the British public over the next 12 months were a price worth paying (Kwasi Kwarteng almost went there last week, saying the public were prepared for “sacrifices”). But he was sending a clear signal to voters that when they open up next month’s energy bill, or wince as they get to the supermarket till and see how much their shopping costs, they should put the blame on an international crisis, not on the government. Labour believes that won’t wash with a public who were already feeling the impact of rocketing inflation – and Conservative policies, including the cut to universal credit – even before the tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border. There was another political sleight of hand at the heart of Sunak’s statement, too. With great fanfare, he highlighted the announcement that the threshold for national insurance contributions (NICs) would rise by a chunky £3,000 next month, and income tax would be cut by 1p in 2024, calling it “the biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century”. He was not willing to let his ambition to cut the basic rate of income tax “wither and drift”, he said, and while he couldn’t justify it this year, he would press ahead with it in two years’ time. The increase in the NICs threshold was welcomed by experts such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ Paul Johnson as a sensible simplification, as well as a tax cut, bringing national insurance in line with income tax. Yet, as the OBR pointed out, these much-vaunted tax cuts only reverse one-sixth of the tax increases the Johnson government has announced. This has been a pattern with Sunak: his NICs cut helps soften the blow of a measure he brought in himself in the autumn – the health and social care levy – just as the cut in the universal credit taper rate he introduced in the budget partly offset the reversal of the £20-a-week Covid uplift he had pushed through. He is evidently banking on a pat on the back from voters at the next general election for cutting their taxes, even when he has, in fact, increased them. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, tried to capture the absurdity of this position with an extended Alice in Wonderland metaphor; the Liberal Democrats’ leader, Ed Davey, called it the “Sunak swindle”. But Tory backbenchers were overjoyed. And of course, those backbenchers will form the electorate for the first round of any leadership contest that might take place in the not-too-distant future. Sunak insisted on the NICs increase as a quid pro quo for funding the prime minister’s plan to cap social care costs, but it was loathed by many of his colleagues and further dented his credentials as a Thatcherite small-state tax cutter. The Treasury’s new tax plan, announced alongside the statement, says that from now on tax cuts, not more public spending, will be the first priority – and tackling the deficit is back in vogue. George Osborne hailed it as putting “Tory economics back on track”. It remains to be seen how well the plan sits with Sunak’s neighbour in No 10, who loathed the very idea of austerity, loves grands projects and tends to want to reach for the spending taps. And it is unclear, too, whether voters promised “levelling up” – only mentioned once by Sunak, in passing – will hail the government for handing them a tax cut after two years that, judging by the OBR’s forecasts, look very grim indeed.",News/UK news,Rishi Sunak’s sleight of hand aims to shift blame for hardship ahead,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/sunak-sleight-of-hand-hardship-ahead-spring-statement
3/24/2022,"At least the speech was short and sweet, coming in at little more than 25 minutes. Rishi Sunak, well, he was not so sweet. The chancellor likes to portray himself as a man of the people. Someone who gets the everyday struggles. A man who feels our pain. A tough call for a millionaire married to a billionaire. Then, I guess he would argue that poverty is relative. And compared to his wife, he’s broke. Sunak also prides himself on being someone who levels with the country. A man who can be trusted to be straight, even when delivering bad news. Neither version of himself survives the slightest contact with reality. Rather he is the worst of both worlds. A chancellor with a veneer of empathy. Who can deliver a spring statement – AKA a seismic budget in any other year – that offers nothing to the poorest and most vulnerable members of society while sobbing on their behalf. Who can tell the chamber with a straight face that he is committed to cutting taxes even when the Office of Budget Responsibility is saying that the tax burden is set to go up to 36.3% by 2026: the highest level since the 1940s. Sunak began with the war in Ukraine. Something Boris Johnson found unaccountably funny. As the chancellor talked of men, women and children huddling in bombed-out basements, the prime minister laughed uncontrollably. Let’s be kind. He probably wasn’t paying attention and was in his own private world. He finds it difficult to concentrate at the best of times, and especially so when he’s not the centre of attention. The longer he went on, the more it became clear that Ukraine was going to take a lot of the blame for the biggest fall in living standards since records began. No matter that prices were rising, inflation was at 6% and rising and interest payments on government debt were at record levels before Russia declared war – Sunak wasn’t going to let a good war go to waste. In his rewritten history, everything was near enough back to normal after the Covid pandemic before Ukraine came along. But we were not to worry. The government was going to stand by the British people. Or rather stand quite near some of them. Don’t want to get too close to the little people. So here’s what was going to happen. First off Sunak was going to cut fuel duty by 5p a litre. Just for a year, mind. Though good luck to anyone who expects him to reinstate the duty in the year before an election. And whether that many people will notice the fuel duty cut is anyone’s guess as the price of petrol has gone up by at least 5p in the past few weeks. So if you haven’t filled up for a fortnight, you probably wouldn’t appreciate the chancellor’s largesse. Even if it cost the exchequer billions. Now it started to get really confusing. After promising a further £500m to help poorer households – “Is that it?” said a lone Labour voice – Sunak assured the house he could only be so generous because he had hitherto handled the economy so marvellously. Which made you wonder how bad things would have got if the chancellor had been a bit shit. “The work starts now,” Sunak insisted. Though many of us could have sworn the Tories had been in power for 12 years. The work Sunak seemed to have in mind was undoing most of what he had done six months ago. Then he had insisted that the 1.5% rise in national insurance contributions was vital to keep the NHS up and running. Now he wanted everyone to forget that the tax increases ever existed. They were so last year. Rather we should focus on the £3,000 rise in the threshold at which NI became liable. Suddenly the tax rise had become a tax cut. It was totally bonkers. Not so much the Iron Chancellor as the Wibbly-Wobbly Chancellor. An amnesiac who has no idea of what he’s doing one day to the next. Sunak ended by saying he wasn’t the sort of chancellor to seek short-term gains and indulge in political opportunism – but then immediately declared he would be cutting the basic rate of income tax by 1p in time for the next general election. Weirdly, he didn’t even have the grace to look embarrassed. This announcement didn’t get quite the collective orgasm from the Tory benches he had hoped for. Perhaps because even the dimmest Conservative MP had worked out the statement was much ado about bugger all and that people would be freezing cold and totally broke long before they could get excited about the 1p income tax cut. The performing seals did, though, dutifully wave copies of Rishi’s “cunning plan”. An eight-page vacuous document filled mainly with pictures of people filling up their cars with petrol. To remind everyone of when you could afford to. It’s never the easiest job to follow a budget statement of which you have no advance sight and Rachel Reeves’ response fell rather flat. The shadow chancellor had spent much of Sunak’s speech hastily crossing out and rewriting parts of her prepared speech. Though God knows why, as there had been no surprises in it. Almost all of it had been leaked well in advance. Reeves would have been better off cutting out the gags. A protracted metaphor of Alice in Sunakland and the description of Rishi as “Ted Heath with an Instagram account” fell totally flat. She had a good story to tell about missed opportunities to help people with the cost of living crisis and there was no need for comedy. Normally she comes across as an engaging performer. Now she just sounded awkward. The prime minister’s questions that had preceded the spring statement had been a dismal affair. Largely because both the Suspect and Keir Starmer realised that no one was really paying attention. Their exchanges lacked any real spark and the highlight was Starmer calling Johnson’s efforts half-arsed. Quarter-arsed, more like it. We were treated to the rare sight of Natalie Elphicke, one of the dimmest of all MPs. A very low bar. She seemed totally bewildered by what was going on with P&O. Someone should gently let her know that if she hadn’t twice failed to vote for changes to the fire and rehire laws then she wouldn’t have the undying contempt of the maritime workers in her Dover constituency.",News/UK news,"A mini budget full of lies from Rishi Sunak, the people’s millionaire | John Crace",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/a-mini-budget-full-of-lies-from-rishi-sunak-the-peoples-millionaire
3/24/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s spring statement included several measures designed to help UK households cope with the rising cost of living. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, despite the measures real household disposable incomes are set to fall by 2.2% in 2022-23 – the largest drop in a single financial year since records began in 1956-57. It says policy measures announced in October will “offset a third of the overall fall in living standards that would otherwise have occurred in the coming 12 months”. Here’s what the spring statement announcements will mean for your finances. To help low-income workers take home more of their pay, the chancellor said that the level at which national insurance contributions (Nics) start to be charged will rise from its current level of £9,880. From July, workers will not make NI contributions until they earn £12,570 a year – the same level that income tax starts to be charged. For some earners the change will cancel out the NI surcharge that will come into effect in April. Figures from the accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg show that those earning up to £41,389 will be better off from July than they are in the current tax year, although their pay will dip before then. According to Blick Rothenberg, the maximum that bills will be cut by as a result of the change in the Nics threshold will be about £330. The table below shows what the two changes mean for different salaries. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says: “Bringing together the expected changes in earnings, the reforms to taxes, and the energy measures announced in February, a median (middle) earner on £27,500 a year can expect to be about £360 worse off this year than they were last. “A full-time worker on the national living wage fares a little better (gaining £140) because of the NLW [‘national living wage’] rising by more than average earnings (though less than inflation) and because of the increase in the Nics threshold.” One of the main measures outlined by the chancellor was a 5p cut in the duty charged on petrol and diesel until March 2023. When VAT is taken into account, this means a fall of 6p a litre at the pumps. Filling up an average family car’s 55-litre engine will cost £3.30 less. This is one for the long term – it will be April 2024 before it comes into effect. At that point, the basic rate of income tax will be reduced from 20% to 19%. The statement said it would be worth an average of £175 a year to 30 million people. However, the personal tax-free allowance is set to stay at £12,570 for the next four years. If this remains the case the IFS says that by 2025-26 “virtually all” workers will be paying more tax on their earnings than they would have paid without Sunak’s policies on rates and thresholds. In April the state pension and other benefits are due to rise in line with September’s inflation figures – so by 3.1%. The chancellor’s decision not to announce a bigger increase means the payments are far behind keeping up with inflation. February’s figure was twice that, at 6.2%, and it is predicted to average 7% during the year. Pensioners on the full state pension will be about £290 a year worse off if inflation stays at 6.2%. For most, the £289-a-year increase will not cover the rising cost of energy, let alone other price rises. The standard allowance for universal credit will rise from £324.84 a month to £334.91 a month for a single person over 25. Again, keeping in line with the current rate of inflation would have required the increase to be doubled, meaning instead a real-terms cut of about £10 a month.",News/UK news,Spring statement 2022: what it means for you,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/spring-statement-2022-national-insurance-fuel-duty-income-tax
3/24/2022,"Harry Kane is determined to shine a light on human rights abuses in Qatar with the help of captains from other national teams after expressing misgivings at the Gulf state hosting the World Cup at the end of the year. The England captain mentioned his Tottenham teammates Hugo Lloris and Son Heung-min – who captain France and South Korea respectively – and also former clubmates such as Gareth Bale – the captain of Wales, who hope to qualify – as he looked to rally strength in numbers to drive lasting social change. Kane and his England teammates were briefed at St George’s Park on Tuesday about the issues surrounding Qatar’s hosting of the finals – chiefly the rights of women, the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers. Gareth Southgate, the England manager, led the conversation, with input from other Football Association members of staff, including Mark Bullingham, the chief executive, and Edleen John, the director of international relations, corporate affairs and co-partner for equality, diversity and inclusion. Southgate and Bullingham will travel to Qatar for the World Cup draw on Friday week and the FA is considering whether to give migrant workers a voice as part of any England media there. Kane said: “There’s a couple of other national captains at Tottenham or maybe it’s talking to other national team captains to see if we can be unified, what we try and do. We haven’t spoken about it yet but, over the next weeks and months, it’s definitely a conversation we should have because when you are together as nations and you have that unity in terms of captains, you can send a message. “It is something I will try to do. I think that will send out a bigger and more powerful message. It is part of the responsibility of a captain. It is important to talk about these things and not just hide away from them. And I know for sure the other lads will be happy to be talking about it, too. Hopefully we can make a real impact.” Kane was asked whether it was right that it had gone to Qatar. “It’s a hard question to answer, if I am totally honest,” he replied. “It wasn’t our decision, it was the decision of Fifa. “The World Cup is one of the greatest tournaments I have ever played in. There is definitely that excitement of being there and experiencing that again – 2018 was incredible for me and the other players involved. But there are some issues that you can’t hide away from. There are, of course, some conflicting emotions around it. “For me and our team it’s about controlling what we can control and that’s to make sure we do what we can and use our platforms to help in any way we can. But also still be excited about a major tournament. We will have to learn to cope with it and balance the two.” Kane admitted that in terms of gestures, the England squad were unclear, as yet, about what they may do. Some national teams in Europe have worn T-shirts and displayed banners that have drawn attention to the human rights issues in Qatar. What Kane did say he wanted to see was action that led to change which went far beyond the four weeks of the tournament. “Any issues that we are trying to resolve are trying to be resolved forever,” Kane said. “It is not just a quick fix. The fact there is a light shining on Qatar will help the situation and help us talk about it. Having these conversations now is definitely useful. But it is important those conversations carry on. “It is similar to taking the knee [in the fight against racism]. It is not just something we did for a small amount of time. By carrying on, we keep showing our support and that has been really important. I think the same thing will happen in Qatar and, after the tournament, it will be important to keep talking about the issues and make sure anything we do help or improve is for the rest of time, not just a few months.” England are preparing for Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast on Saturday and next Tuesday.

3/24/2022,"Nicaragua’s ambassador to the Organization of American States has launched an extraordinary verbal attack on the authoritarian government he is employed to represent, castigating Daniel Ortega’s “indefensible” dictatorship for its assault on human rights and democracy. Arturo McFields Yescas spoke out during an online OAS session on Wednesday, in a startling declaration that spread quickly on social media and was commended by countries such as the US. In it, the Nicaraguan diplomat said he was speaking out “in the name of the 177 political prisoners and the more than 350 people who have lost their lives” since the failed 2018 uprising against Ortega and his vice-president and wife Rosario Murillo. “It’s not easy to denounce my country’s dictatorship – but to carry on in silence and defending the indefensible is impossible,” said McFields, a former journalist who is the son of the Nicaraguan poet David McFields. “I must speak out, despite the fear. I must speak out even though my future and that of my family are uncertain. I must speak out otherwise the stones themselves will speak for me,” added the ambassador, who was appointed by Ortega late last year. The public rebellion came two days after Cristiana Chamorro, the jailed opposition politician who was tipped to challenge Ortega for power in last November’s election, was sentenced to eight years in prison for what her supporters call trumped-up charges of financial crimes. Chamorro is one of scores of opposition figures who were imprisoned in the lead-up to that vote, as part of a ferocious crackdown on Ortega’s political rivals. With his foes in jail or exile, the former revolutionary hero secured another five years in power in an election the US president, Joe Biden, called an undemocratic “pantomime”. That means the the 76-year-old Sandinista, who has governed continuously since being elected in 2006, could rule the Central American country into his 80s. Ortega’s ambassador painted a bleak picture of the situation in Nicaragua under his strongman boss. “Since 2018, Nicaragua has become the only country in Central America – and probably Latin America … where there are no printed newspapers, where there isn’t the freedom to publish so much as a tweet or comment on social networks … [and] there are no human rights organizations. “One hundred and seventy thousand Nicaraguans have fled the country and others are fleeing right now as I speak,” McFields added, before insisting there was hope. “There are people, both in and outside of government, who are tired of this dictatorship and its actions.” Nicaragua’s foreign ministry claimed McFields did not represent Ortega’s government and argued his comments therefore lacked “validity”. However, only on Monday the website of one government-backed group run by one of Ortega and Murillo’s children had described him as Nicaragua’s OAS ambassador.",News/World news,Nicaragua’s ambassador to the OAS denounces Daniel Ortega’s ‘dictatorship’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/nicaragua-ambassador-oas-denounces-daniel-ortega
3/24/2022,"When Coronation Street began in December 1960, Tony Warren’s television creation instantly made its mark with distinctive, believable characters such as Ena Sharples, Elsie Tanner, Annie Walker, Albert Tatlock and Ken Barlow who portrayed life in a working-class back street in the north of England. Around them, Warren peopled the cobbles of the fictional Weatherfield with other equally authentic “residents” in one of television’s first contributions to the social-realist revolution that was already under way on stage and in the cinema. Angela Crow, who has died aged 86, joined the ITV serial for episode 12, screened in January 1961, as the 19-year-old Doreen Lostock, a machinist at Elliston’s raincoat factory in Victoria Street. The ritual of Doreen and her workmate Sheila Birtles (played by Eileen Mayers) buying their favourite lunch from Florrie Lindley’s corner shop earned them the nickname the “barm cake girls”, a term that fixed the soap in time and place. When her supervisor at work, Harold Pilkington (Philip Anthony), groped her, Doreen called him out in front of her fellow workers. He gave her a week’s notice, but she left on the spot. She subsequently worked behind the bar at the Rovers Return pub, having fallen for Billy Walker (Ken Farrington), son of the publican Annie (Doris Speed), and at Gamma Garments, a clothes shop managed by Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe), with Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) as senior assistant. The trio were given plenty of opportunity to perform comedy, notably when Swindley had the women modelling new stock in the shop and on television. When Doreen said “ecky thump”, which was her response to all manner of situations, sad or humorous, it came across not so much as a stereotype of northern people as an affirmation of their identity. Doreen and Sheila eventually rented the flat above the corner shop and, in jiving to the music on their transistor radios and spending their nights on the town in search of boyfriends, represented the opening up of the swinging 60s. However, in 1963, Doreen decided there was life beyond Weatherfield and left to “join the flippin’ army and see the flippin’ world”, heading for the Women’s Royal Army Corps to become a tank driver. Crow had completed 145 episodes between 1961 and 1963, with a break in the middle when those Coronation Street actors not on contract took part in a seven-month strike by Equity members. Like Doreen, Crow said she wanted to “get out there and see the world”, explaining: “I wanted to do Ibsen and Chekhov. I’d had to turn down two meaty parts in the new-wave films [and] it was an exciting time of change in the theatre.” Alongside her stage work, Crow was later in a programme fondly remembered by a whole new generation of viewers. In the BBC children’s sitcom Potter’s Picture Palace (1976-78), Crow played Joan Biddie, receptionist and usherette at a cinema being restored to its former glory by the manager, Peter Potter (Eden Phillips), who had inherited it from his aunt. Crow was born in Horsforth, which was then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to Alice (nee Whalley) and WB (William) Crow. Her father was an author of books on the occult who became a biology lecturer at Leicester College of Technology. Crow’s acting career began when she played truant from Alderman Newton’s girls’ school, Leicester, to appear in Jane Eyre with a touring company. She then trained at Rada in London, where she won the Tree and Emile Littler awards. After graduating in 1954, she gained experience in repertory theatres. She made an early stage appearance as Maria in Twelfth Night at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre in 1956, and then her big break came with the role of Lily Smalls in the original West End production of Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood, adapted from his radio play, at the New (now Noel Coward) theatre (1956-57), which BBC television recorded for a 1957 broadcast. As well as parts in TV plays before joining Coronation Street, Crow had roles in classic serials: she was Nina Fawn in The Eustace Diamonds (1959), Charley in Bleak House (1959) and Betsy in Barnaby Rudge (1960). She also played a housemaid in The Pianist episode of the classic TV sitcom Hancock’s Half Hour in 1957. Later, she was a busy screen character actor, switching between drama and comedy. She had a regular role as Cissie Ludgrove, Irene Handl’s assistant at a hairdressing salon, in the sitcom Barney Is My Darling (1966) and played Calpurnia, the Roman emperor’s last wife, in Heil Caesar! (1973). There was also the part of Liz Stride, believed to be one of the serial killer’s victims, in Jack the Ripper (1988), a miniseries starring Michael Caine as the Scotland Yard inspector Frederick Abberline. On the West End stage, Crow was Dorothy in the writer Richard Harris’s play Stepping Out in 1986 (Duke of York’s theatre) and Rummy Mitchens in George Bernard Shaw’s Major Barbara, directed by Peter Hall (Piccadilly theatre, 1998). She also played Lizzie in Edna O’Brien’s play A Pagan Place at the Royal Court theatre (1972) and Jane, the long-suffering wife of Sidney Hopcroft, in Alan Ayckbourn’s Absurd Person Singular at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh (1981-82). In retirement, living in West Yorkshire, she was a keen member of the Brontë Society, gave talks about the Brontë family and wrote the book Miss Branwell’s Companion (2007). In 2005, Crow married Michael Woods. He died of cancer the following year. She is survived by her son, Jonathan, from her earlier relationship with John La Thangue.

3/24/2022,"A collection of letters by the late novelist John le Carré is to be published later this year. A Private Spy: The Letters of John le Carré 1945-2020 spans almost eight decades, from the author’s childhood in wartime Britain to just days before his death in 2020. It contains letters to le Carré’s family and friends as well as to high-profile fans such as Hugh Laurie, Ralph Fiennes, Stephen Fry, Alec Guinness and Tom Stoppard. Topics range from politics and writing to his first marriage and his relationship with his father, Ronnie Cornwell, a fraudster who spent four years in prison and was an associate of the Kray brothers in London’s criminal fraternity. Le Carré’s publisher, Viking, has called the book “the most intimate portrait of the great writer that will ever be published”. The letters have been selected and edited by le Carré’s son, journalist Tim Cornwell, who said the experience was an “enormous privilege”. He added: “My father was brave in the way that he spoke for what he believed in, brave in the places and subjects he tackled in his writing, and brave in the way he faced illness. His friendships, his obsessions and his incisive wit were no surprise, nor the sheer joy of his writing voice: I recognised the man I knew in every syllable. I hope others will enjoy the journey as much as I have, and laugh, cry, and sometimes wince with me as they read these letters and travel with my father.” Le Carré previously had a career in British intelligence, working for MI5 and MI6 during the 1950s and 1960s before turning to writing, earning critical acclaim around the world for novels such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Night Manager. He died in 2020, aged 89, and A Private Spy will mark his second book published posthumously: his novel Silverview came out last year. Mary Mount, le Carré’s editor at Penguin, said that reading the letters was “a very thrilling and moving experience”. She added: “We are back in his company once again, listening to that inimitable voice: his fiercely acute observations, his humour, his tenderness, his rage. I cannot wait for readers to enjoy this collection, marvellously edited by his son Tim, as much as I have.”  A Private Spy will be published on 3 November.",Arts/Books,‘We are back in his company’: le Carré returns in a revealing collection of private letters,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/23/we-are-back-in-his-company-le-carre-returns-in-a-revealing-collection-of-private-letters
3/24/2022,"Joe Biden is heading to Europe with the aim of keeping up pressure on Russia in the face of sanctions fatigue and splits over energy sanctions among US allies. It will also, to some extent, be a lap of honour for the US president’s success so far in keeping allies and partners together in confronting Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden will take part in an emergency Nato summit, a G7 summit and a meeting of the European Council on Thursday – all groups that largely welcome a return of US leadership and engagement in Europe after the nadir of the Donald Trump administration. But ratcheting up pressure on the Kremlin as the atrocities in Ukraine worsen will be far harder than the concerted measures taken so far. There are fundamental splits within the EU on whether to follow the US in imposing an embargo on energy imports from Russia, with Germany, which is heavily dependent, adamantly against. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has argued it would hurt Germany more than Russia. Previewing Biden’s trip, his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, made clear that the president was not going to push the issue, sensitive to the fact that the implications for Germany and other European states are far more severe than for the US, which imported a very small amount of Russian oil. Biden, Sullivan said, recognized “that some of our European allies and partners would not be able to follow suit and he was not going to pressure them to do so”. However, he made clear that there would be sanctions package announced on Thursday. Some of that is likely to involve the US catching up with Europe. The Wall Street Journal has reported, for example, that Biden will announce targeted measures on members of the Russian state Duma. The US could also enlarge its list of sanctioned Russian oligarchs, which is missing some of the names that are on European and British lists. Sullivan said a principal focus will be on tighter enforcement of existing measures. Part of Thursday’s announcement, he said would be “a joint effort to crack down on evasion on sanctions-busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine or weaken or get around the sanctions”. That may mean more details of a joint taskforce aimed at tracking down the hidden assets of the oligarchs, Putin’s circle and their extended families. Another tougher element of the European Council meeting will be an effort to forge a common front towards China, before a planned EU summit with Xi Jinping next week. Biden wants the Europeans to echo the US message that any supplies of Chinese armaments to the faltering Russian military campaign would have severe consequences for economic relations. The Nato meeting will in theory be an easier affair. On the eve of the summit, the alliance announced it will double the number of its deployed battlegroups, sending them to Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, matching the bilateral deployments already made by the US, the UK and others to Poland and the Baltic states. The secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there would be more announcements on the eastern flank on Thursday. Behind closed doors, the leaders will have to make plans for how to respond to a range of extreme contingencies, like the use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by a desperate Putin. Before boarding the Marine One helicopter on the first leg of his trip, Biden repeated his warning that chemical weapons, in particular, remain a serious threat. There will also be a discussion of Nato’s long-term plans in terms of deployments. Under a 1997 agreement with Russia, the US agreed not to deploy its troops permanently in the frontline states. Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 it has stepped up the US presence in Poland and the Baltic states, but in rotating deployments to honour the letter of that agreement. But the US and its closest allies now see that deal as worthless and the road is open to contemplate permanent basing, which the Baltic nations, in particular have been calling for. “We don’t have all the answers yet,” Julianne Smith, the US ambassador to Nato, said. “Permanent stationing could be one solution or persistent rotations is another option that could be on the table. At this point, what we need to do is have our military commanders give us the best advice they can and come to us with specific proposals.” Underpinning those discussions will be the nagging insecurity that eastern European states have over whether the US would really come to their rescue in the event of a Russian attack. Biden’s trip to Poland on Friday and Saturday will in part be intended to address that anxiety. The president and the Europeans will be meeting are acutely aware that his predecessor called US commitment to Nato into question, and that Trump could return to the presidency in 2025. Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to Nato, argued: “The alliance, and particularly the United States, must also recognize, if only sotto voce for now, how serious the credibility problem has become and the need for it to rise to the top of the long-term US and Nato foreign policy agenda.”",News/US news,Joe Biden heads to Europe in effort to keep pressure on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/joe-biden-europe-russia-ukraine-nato-g7-european-council
3/24/2022,"Brittney Griner has met with a US official for the first time since the basketball star was detained in Russia over allegations she attempted to bring cannabis into the country. US State Department spokesman Ned Price told CNN on Wednesday that an official from the American embassy in Moscow had met with Griner, who has won two Olympic gold medals with Team USA. “We were able to check on her condition, we will continue to work very closely with her legal team, with her broader network, to see to it that she is treated fairly,” Price said. “Our official found Brittney Griner to be in good condition and we will continue to do everything we can to see to that it she is treated fairly throughout this ordeal.” Without identifying Griner, the Federal Customs Service of Russia said earlier this month that a player had been detained in February after arriving at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on a flight from New York. The 31-year-old WNBA star faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of bringing drugs into Russia. Griner’s arrest comes as the US places sanctions on Russia after Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine last month. Some have expressed fears Griner could be used as a bargaining chip with the US as tensions over the war in Ukraine rise. Russian news agency TASS reported that Griner’s detention had been extended until 19 May in a hearing last week. A person close to the situation confirmed to the Guardian that last week’s hearing was solely about Griner’s legal team challenging her detention, and not on the merits of the case, with the hope of getting her transferred to house arrest. The court’s denial of that appeal was not unexpected, the person said. The investigation is still ongoing and a trial date will be set once it has concluded. Until then, the court extends detention by periods of time. If the investigation is not finished by the May hearing, the court will then contemplate how much longer the court needs to extend. The source also confirmed that Griner is “OK” and her Russian legal team has seen her multiple times a week over the entire course of her detention. Griner, like many of her fellow WNBA players, competes in Russia during the league’s offseason. She has played for UMMC Ekaterinburg since 2015, helping the Russian club to three domestic titles and EuroLeague Women championships in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021. Her annual salary of $1m with Ekaterinburg is far in excess of her earnings in the WNBA, where the maximum salary is $228,000. Griner is considered one of the best players in the world. She won gold medals with Team USA at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, the WNBA title with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014 and has been named an WNBA All-Star seven times.",Sport/Sport,US official says Brittney Griner is in ‘good condition’ in Russian jail,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/23/us-official-says-brittney-griner-is-in-good-condition-in-russian-jail
3/24/2022,"There is much about this government’s – and, to its shame, Labour’s – newfound love affair with nuclear power that makes no sense (Johnson announces aim for UK to get 25% of electricity from nuclear power, 21 March). First, you cannot just turn off a nuclear power station. If we have 25% of our electricity generated by nuclear, then on days when all our needs can be met by renewables we will have to turn off 25% of our much cheaper renewable feed while using expensive, taxpayer-subsidised nuclear generation. Second, we have no way of dealing with the mountains of dangerous high-level and intermediate-level waste that has been accruing since the 1950s. To generate more is sheer madness. Third, nuclear power stations are vulnerable to the elements and to hostile attack – cyber, terrorist, state actors etc. Recent events in the Ukraine make this very real. Fourth, the old argument about what we do when the wind isn’t blowing and the skies are overcast over the whole of the UK, which doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny now, falls away completely if we were to invest just a small amount of the taxpayer money that will go to the nuclear industry into research and development of electricity storage. Finally, given the nuclear industry’s track record of bringing in plants well over budget, decades late, the proposed programme is not going to be realised until 2060 at the earliest. Why on earth are we contemplating it?John FrenchBrockweir, Gloucestershire  Your report states that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”. The same justification was used in 2006, when the Labour government first committed to further nuclear power stations. Based on the official forecasts issued in 2006, we should by now be consuming at least 15% more electricity than we were then. But we are not. UK electricity consumption has in practice gone down by more than 15% since 2006. In the interim, no new nuclear power stations have been added to the system. It hasn’t collapsed, and is far less carbon-intensive. Surely we aren’t getting fooled again by the same spurious rhetoric about endless consumption growth? In that immortal phrase of the 1970s: “Save it. You know it makes sense.”Andrew WarrenChairman, British Energy Efficiency Federation  The dash to fossil fuels is not the environmental disaster set out by António Guterres (Ukraine war threatens global heating goals, warns UN chief, 21 March). It is, at worst, the replacement of existing hydrocarbons purchased from Russia. In the longer term, it is clear that alternative renewable energy sources will displace fossil fuels and most countries will wish to do this as quickly as possible. The government’s desire, supported by Labour, for increased nuclear power generation is bizarre. A wind turbine capable of producing 15MW can be installed offshore for £10m. Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and produce 3.2GW of electricity – this does not include decommissioning costs. To generate 3.2GW would need 214 turbines costing £3.2bn, albeit some money would need to be spent on storage capacity. The government plans to invest £1.7bn in Sizewell C.

We should begin future-proofing as far as we can. It has been clear for years that foreign ownership of UK property and land must be restricted. Any involvement by offshore trusts should be banned. These restrictions would help prevent, or limit, situations like the present one. More importantly, with a housing shortage that affects large numbers of us, such restrictions would help constrain increasingly ridiculous property prices. In 2018, as part of a policy to curb rocketing house prices, New Zealand banned the sale of homes to many foreign purchasers. Increasingly, countries in Europe and beyond are restricting foreign property and/or land ownership in the interests of their citizens. It does no favours to any of us if successive governments fail to legislate to prevent the sale of properties to those who use them as vanity projects (often unlived in), and the UK merely as a secure vault for their billions.

3/24/2022,"There is a pattern according to which the Conservative party chooses its leaders as the antidote to their predecessor. Theresa May was the stolid answer to David Cameron’s flimsiness; Boris Johnson promised to be a daredevil where May had been dour. On that principle, Rishi Sunak had positioned himself as the candidate of sincerity and competence, Boris Johnson being the opposite of those qualities incarnate. When the prime minister looked close to being toppled during the “partygate” scandal, the chancellor’s support was tepid. Then came war in Ukraine, a geopolitical crisis to make any domestic scandal look parochial by comparison. The change in perspective was a reprieve for Johnson. Tory MPs are no longer agitating for a replacement. Sunak’s loyalty can no longer waver so conspicuously. The ambition is undiluted. Its expression was clear from a spring statement fashioned entirely around the Conservative party fetish for cutting taxes. Sunak was under pressure to abort a national insurance hike due next month, branded as a levy for health and social care. Although the original impetus for that move had come from No 10, the chancellor bought into the political gamble – taking flak for breaking a manifesto pledge in order to avert the greater electoral hazard of an NHS funding meltdown. A U-turn would blow a hole in the budget, with the added sting of making him look weak in yielding to demands from backbenchers and the opposition. Also, the received wisdom in Downing Street is that the optimal time for cutting taxes is just before an election. Voters might then carry the happy vibe straight into the polling booth. Sunak’s ideological preference for a smaller state is not in doubt. He is a devout Thatcherite but of a particular denomination – the fiscally flagellant cult that insists on discipline in borrowing, reduced deficits and tighter spending before indulging in the pleasure of the tax cut. He was keen in his speech on Wednesday to emphasise how borrowing costs have risen and how global uncertainty demands the observance of “fiscal rules with a margin of safety”. But for many Tory MPs, the optimal time for cutting taxes is always now. The chancellor didn’t want to disappoint them – and he found a solution that is more politically elegant than economically rational. The impact of the national insurance rise will be blunted by raising the threshold at which the tax is paid. Most thrillingly for Conservatives, Sunak has also booked in a 1p reduction in the basic rate of income tax for 2024. A VAT reduction on solar panels and insulation will help homeowners with enough of a disposable income to be in the market for greener energy hardware, which is not the demographic most in need of immediate help. That isn’t any consolation for people struggling with their bills right now, but not much of the spring statement was aimed further than the Tory benches. In terms of the immediate cost of living crisis, there was a 5% cut in fuel duty and an increase in the household support fund – a meagre pool of local authority grants. Meanwhile, inflation will shrivel the real value of state benefits and departmental budgets. For all the chancellor’s declared intention to throw a warm economic security blanket around the nation’s shoulders, people on the lowest incomes will be left out in the cold. The whole package expressed a rhetorical contortion. Sunak wants to satisfy the Conservative self-image as a party of low taxation. At the same time, he can’t ignore economic reality shaped by the pandemic, war in Europe and public demand for services that are not completely derelict. The overall tax burden will still be at its highest level since the late 1940s. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects real household disposable income to fall this year at the fastest rate since records began. What the chancellor advertised as an exercise in building economic resilience is really austerity by stealth, with the pain felt most by people who can least afford it. That promises a bumpy ride to the next election, albeit with comfort breaks for some Conservative target voters. The political consequences are impossible to predict. Governments do not generally get more popular by making millions of people poorer. Then again, Britain has a record of swallowing bitter economic pills dispensed by Tory governments and returning the party to power, while Labour waits in vain for the pendulum to swing. In the current crisis, Johnson and Sunak have a genuine alibi. It was Vladimir Putin who invaded Ukraine. That aggression, and the western sanctions to punish it, threaten a long war of economic attrition with a totalitarian state that doesn’t hesitate to impoverish its own citizens. Fuel is the first commodity to be affected. Grain is next. Ukraine and Russia account for around a quarter of the world’s wheat exports. A protracted war will make food scarce in some countries and more expensive everywhere. These are perils unseen by western European electorates for generations. They require a level of candour from politicians about the scale and duration of the necessary sacrifices; also, economic policies that distribute the cost fairly. Nothing in Johnson’s career suggests he can rise to that challenge. Any vestigial hope that he might do so was dashed when he compared Ukraine’s battle for survival to Britain’s decision to leave the EU. History invited the prime minister to reach for a Churchillian mode of national reconciliation, the role for which he has always imagined himself destined. Instead he chose the only way he knows: crass insensitivity and cynical division. Sunak had the chance to be different. He emerged from the pandemic poised to be the anti-Johnson; the serious alternative. But he missed the turning in the road. There is no room now for repudiation. Whether they trust each other or not, from here onwards, Boris and Rishi are a duplicitous double act; the same record, the same fate.

3/24/2022,"A prominent adviser to Vladimir Putin has resigned from the government and reportedly left Russia in the highest-ranking defection yet over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin’s special envoy for relations with international organisations for sustainable development, was confirmed on Wednesday to have left the government. Chubais’ resignation was motivated by his “opposition to President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine”, two people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg News, which first reported the story. Chubais is now reportedly in Turkey, where the newspaper Kommersant published a photograph of a man resembling the former Kremlin official at a cashpoint. Chubais was allegedly sighted in Istanbul as early as last week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov confirmed that Chubais had resigned from the government on Wednesday but did not say whether or not he had left the country. “Yes. Chubais has resigned voluntarily. And it is up to him whether to leave or not,” Peskov said during a daily press briefing, according to the Interfax news agency. Chubais is not a particularly influential member of the government and has no say in security affairs, but his resignation will create headlines in a country where most Russians know his name. Chubais is best known as the architect of Russia’s controversial privatisation scheme in the 1990s, which helped create the country’s market economy but also concentrated immense wealth in the hands of a group of wealthy oligarchs. A former chief of staff under Boris Yeltsin, Chubais recommended Putin for his first Kremlin position as deputy chief of the presidential staff in 1997, several years before he emerged as Yeltsin’s successor. The former economist held a number of government roles during the 2000s, including the head of the state-run Rusnano firm. He was named Putin’s climate envoy in 2020. In his years in government, Chubais established himself as a consummate political survivor, maintaining a role in Russia’s government despite his liberal credentials and the lingering anger over the pain of the Yeltsin government’s economic reforms. Yet after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began last month, he began to air signs of discontent, posting images of the slain opposition politician Boris Nemtsov and that of the liberal economist Yegor Gaidar, who had warned of the dangers of imperial ambitions under Putin. “In our arguments about Russia’s future I didn’t always agree with him,” Chubais wrote. “But it appears that Gaidar understood strategic risk better than I, and that I was wrong.” Very few current or former Kremlin officials have spoken out against the war. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former chief economic adviser to Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of the Russian security council and former president, condemned the war in an interview with Mother Jones magazine last week, saying: “Wars are the worst things one might face in life … My thoughts are with Ukrainian civilians.” He was promptly fired from his remaining government positions.",News/World news,Putin adviser Anatoly Chubais quits and leaves Russia over invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/putin-adviser-anatoly-chubais-quits-leaves-russia-invasion-ukraine
3/24/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s spring statement did not have much support for environmentally friendly policies. Although there was a reduction in VAT on items such as solar panels and heat pumps, there were also environmentally regressive policies such as reducing the cost of petrol. Here are five policies Sunak could have introduced to make his spring statement more environmentally friendly. Oil and gas companies are enjoying a bonanza from prices that were already soaring in the recovery from the Covid-19 recession, now sent even higher by the war in Ukraine. The cost of extraction is the same, so the elevated price companies are getting for their products is pure profit. Even the normally conservative International Energy Agency has recommended the measure, and Labour estimates a windfall tax could bring in £3bn that could be recycled to reduce energy bills for hard-pressed households. But the chancellor has adamantly refused. After working from home in the pandemic, many people have returned to the office in their cars instead of braving public transport, and this habit seems to be sticking. But if the UK is to meet its carbon budgets, reducing stubbornly high emissions from cars will be essential. Making public transport cheaper or even free would serve several purposes: reducing the UK’s overall fuel use, which would bring down petrol costs for those still needing their cars; reducing greenhouse gas emissions; cutting air pollution; cutting the cost of living for the poorest, who are most reliant on public transport; and encouraging people to work from offices, which the government wants them to do. The fiasco of the green homes grant – the insulation programme introduced as a “build back greener” measure during the Covid pandemic and scrapped after six months – showed that the UK does not have enough trained installers of insulation and heat pumps. Building up those skills and investing in the skills needed for other green measures, from renewable energy to building more climate-resilient infrastructure, would benefit green jobs, help with levelling up and help households out of fuel poverty. VAT has been removed from solar panels and energy efficiency materials at last, and the government is planning grants of up to £5,000 for heat pump installations under its boiler upgrade programme from April. But there is much more that could be done to improve energy efficiency in the UK’s draughty homes, such as green mortgages that enable people to add the cost of upgrades to their mortgages at low interest rates, or under loans from the UK Infrastructure Bank that charged zero interest. From creating new cycle routes and electric vehicle-charging networks in towns and cities, to tree-planting and building flood defences in rural areas, there are dozens of ways in which new infrastructure is needed to help the UK cut greenhouse gas emissions, and adapt to the impact of the climate crisis. Investment in this infrastructure would not only cut emissions but improve people’s health and wellbeing, and could create tens of thousands of new “shovel-ready” green jobs around the UK.",News/UK news,The green policies left out of Rishi Sunak’s spring statement,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/the-green-policies-left-out-of-rishi-sunaks-spring-statement
3/24/2022,"The second round of senators’ questioning of Ketanji Brown Jackson kicked off on Wednesday after a marathon 13-hour judiciary committee hearing with the supreme court nominee the day before. The latest hearing began with a review of the previous day’s proceedings, as the Democratic chairman, Dick Durbin, criticized some of his Republican colleagues over their questioning of Jackson. “For many senators, yesterday was an opportunity to showcase talking points for the November election. For example, all Democrats are soft on crime. Therefore, this nominee must be soft on crime,” Durbin said. He told Jackson, “Well, you’ve made a mess of their stereotype.” At Tuesday’s hearing, the Republican senator Josh Hawley argued Jackson had given lenient sentences to child abuse images offenders. Durbin cited fact-checks showing Jackson’s sentencing practices were fairly typical for federal judges, and he noted she had been endorsed by a number of law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police. After Durbin’s opening statement, the Republican senator John Cornyn accused the chairman of attempting to “editorialize” the hearing by offering comments after each Republican member’s questioning. “It’s called chairman’s time,” Durbin replied to Cornyn. “We waited through chairman’s time when we had Republican chairs. There will not be a separate set of rules for Democrats in control of this committee.” The senators’ sparring underscored how contentious and partisan supreme court nominations have become. Despite Jackson’s sterling credentials, it remains unclear whether her nomination will attract a single Republican vote of support. In comparison, the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer was confirmed with a bipartisan vote of 87 to 9 in 1994. Lindsey Graham, a Republican member of the judiciary committee, had previously been considered a possible yes vote for Jackson’s confirmation because he supported her nomination to the DC circuit court last year. But on Wednesday, Graham made clear he is very unlikely to support Jackson’s supreme court nomination. Graham and Jackson engaged in a contentious back-and-forth about her sentencing in child abuse images cases. As he went over his allotted questioning time by more than 10 minutes, Graham repeatedly interrupted Jackson to accuse her of failing to properly punish child abuse image offenders, saying her sentences were “making it easier for the children to be exploited”. Jackson appeared to grow visibly frustrated with Graham’s questioning, and she argued that judges have a responsibility to be “rational in our dealing with some of the most horrible kinds of behavior”. “This is what our justice system is about. It’s about judges making determinations in meting out penalties to people who have done terrible things,” Jackson told Graham. “Senator, every person in all of these charts and documents I sent to jail because I know how serious this crime is.” Before Graham’s outburst, the Democrat Jon Ossoff was the first senator who posed questions to Jackson on Wednesday. Ossoff and Republican Thom Tillis were the only two senators on the 22-member judiciary committee who did not have an opportunity to question Jackson on Tuesday. Ossoff asked Jackson to tell members about her brother, Ketajh Brown, a veteran and former Baltimore police department officer. Jackson recounted how her brother chose to become a police officer after graduating from the historically Black Howard University in Washington. “He could have done many things coming out of college with a college degree, but decided he wanted to be a police officer,” Jackson said. “It was a very stressful period for us as a family because – as proud as we are of his service, as much as we know it’s important – law enforcement is a dangerous profession. And as family members, you worry.” Jackson also offered Ossoff more details about her 2019 ruling that Don McGahn, Donald Trump’s former White House counsel, had to comply with a subpoena from the House judiciary committee. In her ruling, Jackson summarily dismissed Trump’s claims of executive privilege, writing, “Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.” On Wednesday, Jackson stood by her ruling in the case, underscoring the importance of the separation of powers in the US government. “Our constitutional scheme, the design of our government, is erected to prevent tyranny,” Jackson said. “The separation of powers is crucial to liberty. It is what our country is founded on.” After Ossoff and Tillis wrapped up, every member of the committee was given the opportunity to engage in a second, shortened round of questioning. Despite the many questions left for Jackson to face, Democrat Pat Leahy voiced optimism about her ultimate confirmation, emphasizing: “You will become a member of the US supreme court.”",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson returns for second round of Senate questioning,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/ketanji-brown-jackson-senate-questioning-second-round-republicans
3/24/2022,"In the nine years she has volunteered at the Ward End Elim church food bank in Birmingham’s Hodge Hill, Pat Woolridge has never known so many people to be struggling. The constituency in the east of Birmingham has the highest fuel poverty rate in England at 27.4%, much higher than the national average of 13.4%, so many were hoping for a lifeline in Rishi Sunak’s spring budget announcement on Wednesday. “It’s just getting worse and worse, our numbers are going up massively. People have struggled throughout the pandemic, but now it’s the fuel poverty,” she said. “We’ve had people come here who have had no money to feed their meter, and they have no electricity, and when they get to us they’re really hungry. People do not have the money to budget and benefits are not going up, but everything else is. “We see, week in, week out, people who are scared for the future.” She said the government’s piecemeal approach to tackling issues was making little impact. The chancellor’s announcement of an extra £500m for the household support fund to help struggling families was “a tiny drop in the ocean”, she said. Plans such as raising the national insurance threshold would have no effect for the poorest in society, she added. “The people we see are not paying national insurance anyway, and they’re still not getting enough money to feed their [energy] meters, which is the poorest people on the highest tariffs.” The Labour MP for the constituency, Liam Byrne, said the budget would mean “colder homes for kids and pensioners, and longer queues for food banks”. “Rishi Sunak had a choice today about who to help and, incredibly, he decided to help the richest. Two-thirds of the cut in national insurance [will] go to the lucky top half of society,” he said. “This was quite simply a budget that failed to rise to the new challenges of a post-Covid, war-ravaged global economy and a country still struggling to adjust to Brexit.” On a busy shopping street in the centre of Hodge Hill, it was rising fuel and food costs on most people’s minds. “Everything has gone sky high, it’s terrible. I don’t know how people are going to be able to afford it. There’s going to be a lot of crime happening I think,” said Ali Zaman, 30, a supermarket worker. “Even if you go down to Tesco, milk has gone up. It’s everything.” He said that while cutting fuel duty by 5p a litre would help, it wouldn’t go far enough for people who were really struggling. “It’s good to see that but I don’t know how much difference it will make,” he said. Woolridge also stressed that rising fuel costs were going to have a huge impact on low earners. “Some people are not even going to be able to afford to go to work, because there is not enough salary coming in to heat their homes or fill their cars,” she said. Linda McGowan, 69, said she and her husband, both pensioners, had stopped using their car as much because of rising fuel prices. She had hoped the spring budget would include measures to boost pensions but was not surprised they did not get much of a look-in. “I know pensions did go up previously but it wasn’t much,” she said. “We’re just not going to be able to manage on how much we get. We are very worried about it, and I think a lot of people are really struggling. “I know the weather is getting warmer, but if you’re a pensioner and you’re stuck in all day and you need the heating on, where is the money going to come from?” Back at Elim church, a queue started to form outside the building shortly before doors opened at 1pm. One of three branches of the Aston and Nechells food bank, it has handed out 197 food parcels so far this year, up from 145 during the same period last year, and is only expecting numbers to rise when energy price rises hit in April. “We can only prepare so much. All of our food is donated and we’re seeing fewer donations coming because people can’t afford it any more,” she said. “It does seem as if there’s a disconnect between the government and reality,” said Keith, another volunteer at the food bank. “It’s almost as if they live in a bubble of their own, they aren’t seeing what is actually happening. It needs fixed and it needs fixed as soon as possible for the sake of the future of the country.”",News/UK news,‘A drop in the ocean’: Birmingham responds to Sunak’s mini-budget,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/a-drop-in-the-ocean-birmingham-responds-to-sunaks-mini-budget
3/24/2022,"The former boyfriend of a woman who was left with catastrophic brain injuries when she fell out of a van he had bundled her into has had his prison sentence increased. Chay Bowskill, of Syston, Leicestershire, bundled Angel Lynn into a van being driven by his friend Rocco Sansome as she tried to walk away from him after an argument in September 2020. She was found lying seriously injured in the carriageway of the A6 near Loughborough, and remains in hospital requiring round-the-clock care. Bowskill was originally sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for kidnapping, coercive behaviour and perverting the course of justice. His sentence was increased to 12 years by court of appeal judges on Wednesday, after they concluded his original term for the kidnap was not long enough. Sansome, 20, of Birstall, Leicestershire, had been found guilty of kidnap and sentenced to 21 months in prison; his sentence has not been changed. Giving a summary of the judges’ decision, Dame Victoria Sharp said: “We have concluded that the sentence passed on him for the kidnap was unduly lenient.” She said the original term “failed to reflect the seriousness of the kidnap” and the harm caused to Lynn as a result. The judge said Sansome’s sentence “should have been longer” but that, in all the circumstances, including the fact he is close to being released, the court decided not to alter it. Speaking outside the court after the ruling, Lynn’s aunt Jackie Chamberlain said the family were “relieved” by the sentence increase. She said: “We’re very grateful to the British public, who have supported us as a family all the way along. We can put this behind us now. We can move on.” She also thanked Women’s Aid for its support. The pair were sentenced after a trial at Leicester crown court in January. CCTV footage played to jurors showed Bowskill grabbing Lynn as she walked away from him after an argument and bundling her into a silver Transit van, which was driven off at pace by Sansome. The defence claimed Lynn jumped or accidentally fell on to the road, and Bowskill was cleared of causing grievous bodily harm. Lynn’s family referred the sentence to the attorney general, Suella Braverman, under the unduly lenient sentence scheme. “I don’t think any sentence will be long enough, as far as we’re concerned,” Angel’s mother, Nikki Lynn, said in an interview with the Guardian. “But we want to move on with our lives now and focus on caring for Angel.” The 21-year-old is unable to walk or talk and is fed through a tube, although her family have hope her condition is improving as she has started squeezing their hands in response to questions. “Her eyes seemed grey before; it didn’t look like she was there, there was nothing inside,” said Nikki. “She’s got really bright blue eyes, and you can see now that they seem more alive, the colour is more noticeable. She’s definitely in there.” The family have raised £129,000 to help fund a lifetime of care for Angel, and they hope to build an extension on their house so she can be moved home soon, although they have been warned the care bill could run into millions. “I just want her home so I can do things with her and take her out and care for her,” Nikki said. “It must be awful for a 21-year-old to have to be changed and washed by strangers every day.” She described her daughter as a “girly girl” who enjoyed time with friends and doing her hair and makeup, but was also very active and enjoyed quad biking and jetskiing. “She was so outgoing before. Being stuck in a bed all day and breathing unaided now, is that the best we have to hope for the rest of our lives?” said Angel’s aunt Jackie Chamberlain, adding the family believed the sentences for Bowskill and Sansome would have been much harsher if Angel had died. “But she’s got no life at all. She’s had aided breathing for two years. Her life is completely ruined: she’ll never get married, never have children, she’ll never get a job, They’ve ruined her whole life,” she said. The family said a recent campaign launched by the government to highlight the dangers of coercive control was not enough. “We feel the sentencing structure should be looked at as a whole because even the maximum sentences are nowhere near enough,” said Chamberlain. “We’ve become part of a club that we never wanted to become a part of. You look at all the stories on the TV, all the women who have been killed, and you feel so far removed from it. But when something like that happens to you, everything becomes crystal clear. This happens so much and it just keeps getting worse. Where will it end?” Sharp said Bowskill must serve two-thirds of his sentence behind bars before he can be released.",News/UK news,Former boyfriend who kidnapped Angel Lynn has sentence increased,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/former-boyfriend-who-kidnapped-angel-lynn-has-sentence-increased
3/24/2022,"Sex can often be a disappointment – particularly for women. A recent study from the official publication of the International Academy of Sex Research shows that while gay and straight men climax about during about 85% of their sexual encounters, women having sex with women orgasm about 75% of the time, while women having sex with men come last (literally) at 63%. On a first-time hookup, the gap widens further, with 80% of men reaching orgasm compared with only 40% of women. This issue, known as the “orgasm gap” or “pleasure gap” (because orgasms aren’t always the goal) is the jumping-off point for Netflix’s new docuseries The Principles of Pleasure. In this three-parter, narrator and comedian Michelle Buteau takes viewers on an educational journey of what the pleasure gap is, why it happens, and how on earth we get past it. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers sex to be part of our overall quality of life – as the show outlines – so women having less pleasure than men means they also have a lesser quality of life. Fundamentally, this means coupled men and women – regardless of how loving they may be – are not equal in their relationships. Researchers have connected equality – pleasure and otherwise – to sexual consent and say that not having this equality means women are more likely to be coerced into unwanted sex. This feels like the first time this connection has been explained on mainstream TV, making The Principles of Pleasure feel almost revolutionary. Part of the show’s importance is in highlighting how far behind even the science on the subject is. One of the most eye-opening lessons unfolds in the first six minutes, when Dr Emily Nagoski – author of the sex-science book Come As You Are – tells us that modern sexual sciences still lack an understanding of how pleasure even works. “We do not have a basic understanding of the system we want to partake in,” she states bluntly. We are given the disappointing truth by scientists working in the field. Psychologist Dr Lori Brotto and sexual psychophysiologist Dr Nicole Prause explain how many research proposals – including Prause’s own – which could uncover a lot of missing information about female orgasms, ejaculation, arousal and dysfunction have been rejected due to male discomfort in the science community. The series peels back the curtain on a mostly hidden industry, revealing that even the scientific teams behind human discovery do not act without bias. Decades on from Sigmund Freud dismissing the clitoris and telling every woman with a sexual problem that she was “hysteric” (which, as the show tells us, comes from the Greek word for uterus), our understanding of female pleasure is still being defined by men. So while science has become much less grisly in its methods (scientists aren’t running around removing people’s clitorises any more) little has changed in terms of the sidelining of women’s pleasure. “Imagine if you could go back in time and learn about your body, about sex and how to embrace your desires without fear. How would the rest of your life be different?” the narrator asks. The other part of Principles of Pleasure’s importance is its attempt to put power in women’s hands. While appreciating that it shouldn’t be our responsibility to trial-and-error our way to good sex, the show offers genuine take-home sex education lessons we can use to teach ourselves to give, receive, invoke and enjoy pleasure, while science slowly catches up. It is refreshing to see these topics discussed so openly on screen. It’s almost liberating to see sex toy expert Dirty Lola teach us how to masturbate in ways that work for us, including what toys to try to how to use them. Nagoski’s teachings also feel hugely welcome, as she shows us how to increase our body confidence so that we can see ourselves as a more sexual person – recommending we stand in front of the mirror and compliment the things we love daily. The show also nails something critical: consent. The experts and interviewees take us through how to properly ask for and give it, without any surface-level analogies. Instead, they jump into the nitty-gritty of how early experiences of trauma warp our perceptions of sex, which can lead us to struggle with giving, turning down or receiving consent. This element of the show is especially important, as 97% of women surveyed in the UK have experienced some form of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, and 96% do not speak up. “We live in a world where women feel like they need to say ‘yes’ to everything or ‘no’ to everything and that’s not where great sex happens. Great sex requires that clarity of communication that grants everyone permission to [ask for what they need specifically],” says Nagoski, further explaining how this missing piece often results in women “consenting” to sex they don’t want. The main takeaway from Principles of Pleasure is that the biggest, most complex sexual organ is not our genitals, but our minds. That’s why oppressive structures, beliefs and policies have been able to wriggle into our psyches and directly affect our sex lives even if we don’t believe in them. It is also, however, why we’re turned on by people’s personalities and ideas. It’s why talking to our sexual partners inarguably stretches sexual potential, and why we can undo those problems with our own connectivity and creativity. From complimenting ourselves in front of a mirror to turning consent into foreplay by asking “would you like it if I did this?”, we can use our minds to make sex better, rather than treating sex as a hopeful game of button-pushing. As the narrator says in the show’s conclusion: “Next time pleasure feels too far away or too complicated to get to, pause. Try to get really quiet, because the answers are within you.”",Arts/Television & radio,The orgasm gap: can Netflix’s new sex ed show revolutionise women’s lives?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/23/the-orgasm-gap-can-netflixs-new-sex-ed-show-revolutionise-womens-lives
3/24/2022,"Protests have taken place during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Caribbean tour, with the royal family accused of having historically benefited from the slave trade and the British empire. But what exactly are the monarchy’s historical links to slavery? The royal family’s links date back to the 16th century. In 1562, John Hawkins was the first known English person to include enslaved Africans in his cargo, a journey that was approved by Elizabeth I. The enslaved Africans were traded for goods including ginger and sugar. In 1564, Hawkins arranged another voyage, for which Elizabeth I funded a vessel. In 1660, the Royal African Company was established by the Duke of York, who later became James II, with involvement from his brother, Charles II. The Royal African Company was prolific within the slave trade; according to the Slave Voyages website, between 1672 and 1731 the Royal African Company transported more than 187,000 slaves from Africa to English colonies in North, Central and South America. Many of the enslaved Africans transported by the Royal African Company were branded “DY”, standing for Duke of York. Between 1690 and 1807, an estimated 6 million enslaved Africans were transported from west Africa to the Americas on British or Anglo-American ships. The slave trade was protected by the royal family and parliament. It is difficult to estimate just how much of the current royal family’s wealth is owed to slavery, but it is understood that the profits of the slave trade funded the Treasury, as well as Britain’s industries, buildings, railways, roads and parks. According to Prof Corinne Fowler, an academic at the University of Leicester who specialises in Britain’s colonial legacies, the royal family “has an opportunity to show leadership by acknowledging its involvement, making a formal apology and asking openly and humbly what the family can do to begin to repair the damage”, and a first step to moving on “might be to decide that the Queen should no longer be ceremonial head of state”.",News/UK news,What are the British monarchy’s historical links to slavery?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/british-royal-family-monarchy-historical-links-to-slavery
3/24/2022,"There have been plenty of bad years for the economy in the recent past and 2022 is shaping up to one of the worst of them. Energy bills are soaring. Taxes are going up. Inflation has returned with a vengeance. Living standards are set for their biggest fall since modern records began in the 1950s. Faced with this cocktail of misfortune, it was always the height of optimism for Rishi Sunak to imagine he could stick to his plan of delivering a short, policy-light update on the state of the economy in a spring statement. So it has proved. Britain’s cost of living crisis – amplified by the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – meant the spring statement would morph into what has become the chancellor’s speciality in his two and a bit years in the job, a mini-budget. Tory backbenchers cheered lustily when Sunak pulled his rabbit out of the hat – a 1p income tax cut designed to come into force in April 2024, a month before the date being pencilled in for the next general election. But budgets – and mini-budgets – that look good on the day often look less good in the weeks that follow. And there is every risk the chancellor’s latest offering will conform to this pattern. For a start, Sunak’s package was a lot more modest than he tried to make it sound. The package of new measures announced will provide a £9bn stimulus to the economy – or about 0.4% of the economy’s annual output. But as Paul Dales of Capital Economics pointed out: that will still leave households facing a £20bn hit to their real disposable incomes from rising food, fuel and utilities prices over the next couple of years. Living standards, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), are still going to be cut by more than 2% this year. For the most vulnerable – those not working and reliant on state benefits – the squeeze will be even more severe. That’s because they won’t benefit from the £3,000 increase to the threshold for national insurance contributions – a move that mainly helps better off households – but will be clobbered by rising inflation. As the Resolution Foundation thinktank pointed out, of every £3 of new help provided by the chancellor, £2 will go to people in the top half of the income distribution. Pensions, universal credit and other benefits are going up by 3.1% in April, a month when the annual inflation rate is likely to climb above 8%. The OBR thinks inflation is on course to reach a 40-year-high of almost 9% this year, something that will also put the squeeze on the resources available to Whitehall spending departments. Nor do the chancellor’s credentials as a tax-cutting chancellor really stand up to scrutiny. While Sunak would like to be seen as the son of Margaret Thatcher, the net tax cuts announced in the spring statement offset about a sixth of the tax rises introduced since he became chancellor in February 2020. The tax takeaways announced last year – including the freezing of income tax personal allowances and the new health and social care levy – are worth almost four times as much as the giveaways just announced. Sunak has been firefighting ever since he became chancellor. There was a time last autumn, when the end of the furlough scheme went more smoothly than expected, when he could envisage an end to permanent crisis management, but Ukraine means that is no longer feasible, in the short-term at least. The year ahead will be brutal for millions of people. Growth will slow and inflationary pressure will be strong. Sunak is going to come under pressure to use the money he is squirrelling away from pre-election sweeteners to help households and small businesses this year.

3/24/2022,"Owen Farrell is primed to make his rugby return on Saturday for Saracens after a four-month absence. The England captain missed the entire Six Nations campaign following surgery on his right ankle but has spent the past two weeks training with his teammates. Barring another “freak injury” – as the England head coach, Eddie Jones, called the last one – Farrell should be in contention for his first game since November. “We will assess him tomorrow and Friday and make sure everything is OK,” the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said. “Fingers crossed he will be able to take part in the game. “He is obviously a great player, everyone knows that. For him personally it is great as well, he loves playing rugby and he has not played much. If he does play he is certainly looking forward to it and we are chuffed to have him back.” Saracens will play Bristol at Tottenham Stadium as they look to close the 12-point gap to Leicester at the top of the Premiership table. More than 40,000 tickets have already been sold, according to the club’s press officer. Those in attendance will likely see a formidable Saracens team as McCall said that all of his England returnees are available for selection as well. One of them is the hooker Jamie George, who is poised to play his 250th game for the club. Another is the 23‑year‑old lock Nick Isiekwe, who resurrected his international career in the Six Nations this year after a four‑year hiatus. “Nick got capped early, maybe on reflection a bit too early, and had a couple of difficult experiences, especially away in South Africa when he played there,” McCall said, referencing England’s 42-39 defeat in Johannesburg in 2018. “He’s 23 now and much more ready for it. He is on top of his game, a lot more mature and confident in himself.” McCall spoke glowingly of his England stars despite their struggles during a disappointing tournament under Jones: “Historically our players have been superb at coming back. We are also conscious of the fact, especially in the last two games they have played in, they would have taken some kind of emotional toll. “Going down to 14 men against Ireland and playing the way they did and the occasion they were part of on Saturday [the 25-13 defeat in Paris], we are very conscious they are human beings and not robots and not to expect them to jump from international rugby straight into club rugby.” Farrell, though, is one of the few England players whose stock has soared these past two months and he will be itching to re-establish himself as the linchpin for club or country. McCall has no doubt that he will. “It’s easy to look back on history and that tells us normally [he fits in] pretty quickly, to be honest,” McCall said. “He’s got the potential to hit the ground running, that’s for sure. I think we all have to be patient and be aware his best rugby probably won’t be this Saturday, but will be in the weeks to come.”",Sport/Sport,Owen Farrell set to return from injury for Saracens after four months out ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/23/owen-farrell-set-to-return-from-injury-for-saracens-after-four-months-out
3/24/2022,"Throughout the chaotic month of January, Ash Barty burst into the new tennis season in full flow, dismantling all challengers. She scythed them with her backhand slice, out-served opponents who towered over her by half a foot or more, and continually displayed her encyclopaedic knowledge of each opponent’s game, homing in on their weaknesses and methodically picking them apart. In a sport where players tend to focus only on themselves, that last quality is distinct enough. But it is even more fascinating considering Barty’s relationship with tennis. Despite the game flowing through her veins, it is not of particular interest to her aside from personal ambitions and daily work. Off the court she keeps a healthy distance from it, her hobbies are elsewhere, and tennis is never on the TV when she is nearby. “It’s gonna be a great match,” Barty said, when asked about the second semi-final after she reached the Australian Open final. She chuckled to herself. “I probably won’t watch it.” While Barty’s decision to retire on Wednesday at the age of just 25, as the No 1 player in the world and during such a beautiful moment in her career, is a shock on the surface, the manner of her departure fits perfectly with the way she has conducted her career. Since 2014, when as an 18-year-old she took an indefinite break from the sport because of burnout and depression, her message has been consistent. She has worked hard, with ambition and drive, but her priorities have remained her family, personal happiness and mental wellbeing. Barty has always done things her own way. She scheduled tournaments sparingly, always ensuring she had enough time to return home during the season and to enjoy her various other sporting hobbies. When she couldn’t compete without compromising those priorities, as in 2020 when she sat out the second half of the season during Australia’s strictest Covid restrictions, she chose herself. Barty’s careful career management is also what made last year so special. Once she left Australia and resumed competition around the world, she could not return until the end of the year. Barty had to fully commit to the chaos that could follow, travelling from tournament to tournament without a proper base and playing more frequently than she ever has. She did. The physical and mental strain was immense, yet those efforts culminated in Barty achieving the ultimate goal of her career at the tournament she impatiently waits for each year: Wimbledon. It makes sense that as she reflected on adding the Australian Open title to her Wimbledon victory of 2021, she came to the conclusion she had achieved what she had set out to do. Every early retirement in this sport comes with a caveat. Tennis players, particularly in the women’s game, truly love a comeback. The most obvious comparison to Barty’s retirement is Justine Henin’s shock departure in 2008, a player to whom Barty is frequently compared, and who was also world No 1 when she decided to retire. Henin eventually came back in 2010. The difference between them, though, is Henin was already burned out by 2008 and it showed in her results. By comparison, Barty is 11-0 in 2022. It is remarkable she has the self-awareness to assess her situation while standing at the top of the mountain, rather than while beginning to tumble down it. Her message has held out until the end; her tennis career, however successful, joyful and lucrative it has been, should not significantly impact her day-to-day happiness and she has constantly sought perspective in victory and defeat. The possibility of chasing more greatness in tennis is far less important than the off-court contentment she seeks. The career she has built is sublime regardless. Barty has already recorded more total weeks at No 1 than all but six women in history, recently passing Henin. Only Steffi Graf, Serena Williams, Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert had more consecutive weeks at No 1 than Barty’s 113. Barty’s game itself is peerless; she has the best-ever serve for a player of her height, while her backhand slice is one of the great shots of this era. Her forehand, underrated due to the attention on her other talents, dragged opponents off the court with wicked angles and weight. Her talented hands and court sense are paired with incredible athleticism and defence. Her complete game has allowed her to seamlessly adapt to all surfaces and win on all of them. A happy ending for Barty is still a difficult loss for her sport. It would have been interesting to see what effect a sustained period of dominance from Barty had on the tour. A true rivalry, something the sport desperately needs, regrettably evaded her. Naomi Osaka should have been her great adversary but the pair somehow managed to completely avoid each other for three years even as they won a combined seven major titles. Just three days ago, meanwhile, it seemed that Iga Swiatek, the new world No 2, was on an unavoidable collision course with Barty. Not anymore. For such an understated personality, the climax that Barty engineered for herself will be hard to forget. Her final match was on Rod Laver Arena in the Australian Open final, the most watched women’s sporting event in the history of her country, and one of the great Australian sporting moments full stop. Her career ended with one last smooth forehand winner and as the stadium erupted, Barty squeezed her eyes shut and roared into the dark Melbourne sky.",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty built a near-perfect game but never lost sight of the No 1 priority: herself | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/23/tennis-ash-barty-retires-perfect-game-happiness

3/24/2022,"Gareth Bale has said he is ready to play for as long as required when Wales host Austria hoping to secure a World Cup play-off final berth, despite playing only 77 minutes since November. Carlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid manager, said Bale missed the clásico on Sunday because he was unwell but reports in Spain suggested he had a back injury and the Wales captain, while refusing to divulge the reason behind his omission, insisted he was capable of lasting the distance in Cardiff on Thursday. “I’m in very good shape, a lot better shape than the last camp when I’d been out for about three months,” Bale said. “I’ve been training the last couple of days ready to play whatever is necessary tomorrow and we’ll give it everything we can. For sure it will be one of the biggest games I’ve played in. Qualifying for a World Cup is something I want to achieve, for the fans, for the country.” Bale said Wales had practised penalties to prepare for the eventuality of in case the game goes beyond extra time and the 32-year-old is determined to help his country to a first World Cup since 1958. He has also parked thoughts about his future to focus on the occasion. The forward is out of contract this summer and has previously played down suggestions that this could be his final season. “I haven’t thought about anything other than this game or planned for anything after yet,” Bale added. “I want to completely focus on this … I’m not thinking about my future as I need to concentrate on now and the future is a distraction.” Bale is poised to face his clubmate, defender David Alaba, in the semi-final, who is likely to captain an Austria team ranked 30th in the world. “We know it’s big game for both countries, so I’ve stayed away from him in training,” Bale joked.

I’m looking forward to seeing him tomorrow … we’ll have a nice handshake before and after. We’ve spoken a bit about the game but I’ve avoided him in training so he doesn’t kick me. We’ve had friendly banter.” The Spanish daily Marca has insinuated that Bale made himself unavailable for club duty before joining Wales. Asked to clarify what the Wales interim manager, Robert Page, described as a “niggle”, Bale replied: “No, I don’t need to clarify it because I don’t need to tell anyone what was up. I don’t need to give anyone anything to use against me.

3/24/2022,"If you can’t beat them, join them. After years joining his father in deriding the “lamestream media” as the “enemy of the people”, Donald Trump Jr has launched an app to aggregate news. Don Jr and co-founder Taylor Budowich, a spokesperson for the former president, hope that MxM News (the name refers to “minute by minute”) will compete with giants such as Apple News and Google News, the Axios website reported. They claim that a team of about eight staff will curate stories from across the ideological spectrum (“mainstream news without mainstream bias”). But it remains to be seen if that will include fact-checks of Donald Trump’s “big lie”. The ex-president and his son, who frequently joins him at campaign rallies, have long railed against “fake news” and spoken of a need to challenge big tech companies. Axios quoted Don Jr as saying: “As I travel around the country, the complaint I hear more than almost anything else is that people don’t know what media outlets, journalists or stories they can actually trust. “We created the MxM News app to help people cut through that clutter and get trustworthy news and information about topics that matter and impact their lives. We view it as an important public service and also believe it will be a great business.” The app will start as free before looking at ways to make money. Its creators do not currently plan to recruit their own reporters or produce original content. Telegraph Creative, an equity partner in the company, designed and developed the mobile app. Its chief executive is Cliff Sims, a former aide in the Trump White House aide and deputy director of national intelligence. A preview on Apple’s app store states: “MxM News delivers curated news that cut through the censorship, mainstream bias, and institutional dominance that has left society divided and misinformed. “The platform allows readers to access the news that matters, particularly when it is being ignored.

The non-profit is best known for acclaimed productions of Big River and Spring Awakening. Coda tells the story of a 17-year-old girl, played by Emilia Jones, who is the only hearing member of a deaf family. She is determined to chase her dream of being a singer via a school choir club. The film, a remake of French drama La Famille Bélier, also stars Oscar winner Marlee Matlin and Troy Katsur, who could become the first deaf actor to win a best supporting actor Oscar this weekend. DJ Kurs, the artistic director of Deaf West Theatre, called the stage production an opportunity “to bring the story full circle by bringing it back to members of the deaf community and by making the music accessible through our signed and sung live adaptation of the movie”.

3/24/2022,"Italy’s former prime minister Giuseppe Conte is under pressure to clarify an arrangement under which Russia supplied aid to Italy early in the coronavirus pandemic, as questions resurface over the Kremlin’s motives. Conte, who was forced to resign last year after the collapse of his second administration, could face questioning by Copasir, a parliamentary committee for the security of Italy, amid concerns that Russia may have exploited the aid mission for espionage. Italy was the first western country to have a major Covid-19 outbreak, and Russia came to its rescue at the height of the emergency, dispatching military doctors, PPE, ventilators and mobile disinfection machines on cargo planes from Moscow. A convoy of lorries emblazoned with the slogan “From Russia with love” was broadcast on Russian state TV making its way to Bergamo, the province most severely affected in the pandemic’s first wave. The mission was set in motion after a phone call between Conte and Vladimir Putin on 21 March 2020 as Italy struggled to get help from EU partners. At the time, Tod Wolters, a Nato general, and several Italian generals expressed concern, chiefly over the presence of Russian military personnel in Italy and a belief that Russia was exploiting the crisis for propaganda with the goal of weakening Europe. The debate has re-emerged in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and after a Russian diplomat, Alexei Paramonov, a former consul in Milan, threatened Italy and other EU states with “irreversible consequences” over sanctions. Paramonov accused the Italian defence minister, Lorenzo Guerini, of being one of the main “hawks of the anti-Russia campaign” despite allegedly having sought Russia’s help in the early days of the pandemic. Riccardo Magi, a deputy with Più Europa, a small leftwing party, said Conte needed to clarify the agreement to Copasir. Magi questioned the Russian aid mission in parliament on 1 April 2020 and received only a partial response seven months later. “Many were annoyed because it was as if I was embarrassing the government by questioning a country that was seen as a friend,” Magi said. “On some points they responded, on other, more significant points they were elusive. This was a deal that was informally brought together with little caution. Maybe nothing [untoward] happened, but we need to know.” Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, has also questioned the motives of the Russian operation. Conte said the agreement was “very clear and transparent” and came about in a “moment of extreme difficulty”. La Repubblica reported that a formal request for Conte to be heard would be made at a Copasir meeting on Thursday, particularly to shed light on whether measures were in place to ensure the aid mission did not transform into “a spy mission”.",News/World news,Italian former PM faces renewed questions over Covid aid from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/italian-former-pm-conte-faces-renewed-questions-over-covid-aid-from-russia
3/24/2022,"Howard Marshall and his partner, Gavin Chuah, have spent three weeks living out of suitcases and bed-hopping in and out of friends’ homes. Flood water inundated the garage of their South Brisbane unit on 27 February, interrupting the building’s electricity and hot water supplies, and shutting off the lift and fire alarm. The pair says they’ve paid $1,500 in rent since then, despite being unable to live in the property, although they have since agreed to a rental pause with the owner. “They said it might be another two to three weeks before the electricity is reconnected … and they reckon it’ll be another three to four months before the lifts are operational,” Marshall says. While most Brisbane residents who lost power had it restored in the week after last month’s flood, some in low-lying areas such as West End and Milton are still in the dark, according to chief executive of Queensland Tenants, Penny Carr. And that can lead to delicate negotiations between tenants and landlords. Carr said her organisation was currently helping a number of flood-affected residents to negotiate rental reductions and changes to lease agreements. While tenants cannot be compensated for damage or loss “that wasn’t anyone’s fault”, such as possessions being destroyed during a flood, Carr says it’s a different story when a property becomes unliveable. “You shouldn’t be asked to pay to rent something that you can’t use partly or completely,” says Carr. But timeliness is a factor. Under Queensland law, if a property becomes uninhabitable as a result of a natural disaster, the tenant or landlord can seek to break the lease within one month of the disaster, which will expire in the next few days. Carr says the law is not “black and white” where liveability is concerned and for the most part, people choose to stay in their tenancy even if they have to leave their homes for a while. “In a situation like this, where the vacancy rates are really low, renters … might be desperate … so it’s not uncommon for the parties to dispute whether a property is liveable, according to the law.” Rent reductions can also occur when there’s a substantial drop in the standard of a property, according to the Residential Tenancies Authority. If tenants and property managers or owners are unable to come to an agreement, they can request free dispute resolution from the RTA. Following that process, if no agreement is reached, they can then apply to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) for a determination. Carr says QCAT can order an owner or landlord to pay back rent retrospectively but tenants have to keep paying rent until an agreement is reached between the parties.

However, they are still hoping to obtain a refund of the $1,500 paid despite not living in the unit. The manager said he understood the owner had offered to pause the rent for now and then apply the money paid to rent once the apartment was liveable, although Chuah and Marshall said that had not been communicated to them. The chair of the apartment block’s body corporate committee said residents had been advised not to occupy the units until “electricity and other essential services have been restored”, but he does not know when that will be. “People should not be living in their units and doing so [is] contrary to our advice and at their own risk.” For Marshall and Chuah, a good night’s sleep in their own bed is what they’re looking forward to most. “We’re not sleeping well. We’re sleeping in different beds all the time and we’re stressed, worrying about where we’re going to stay,” says Chuah. “We keep waiting for the power to be restored but don’t know what’s going to happen.”",News/Australia news,Flood-hit Queensland renters have just days left to negotiate a break in their lease,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/flood-hit-queensland-renters-have-just-days-left-to-negotiate-a-break-in-their-lease
3/24/2022,"A UN mission under way in Queensland to see if the Great Barrier Reef should be put on an “in danger” list will not get “the whole picture” unless it visits reefs currently experiencing coral bleaching, conservationists and the government’s own reef envoy have said. Details of the 10-day mission, which began on Monday in Brisbane, are being kept confidential and the locations to be visited have not been formally disclosed. But Guardian Australia understands briefings started in Brisbane, and visits to Lady Elliot Island on the reef’s southern tip, as well as time in Cairns and Townsville, are on the agenda. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) is due to complete aerial bleaching surveys across the 2300-kilometre reef before the end of this week. The authority’s chief scientist, Dr David Wachenfeld, has confirmed bleaching is widespread but variable, saying the flights will give a clearer picture of how the event compares with five previous mass bleachings. Fierce lobbying from the Morrison government last year saw the 21-country World Heritage committee ignore a Unesco recommendation that the reef be placed on a list of sites “in danger”, mainly because of impacts from the climate crisis. Instead, the committee asked Australia to renew its cornerstone Reef 2050 policy so that it “addresses the threat posed to the property by climate change” and said it was concerned progress in cutting pollution running off farms and grazing areas was too slow. Australia requested the mission be carried out and the government’s reef envoy, MP Warren Entsch, said it should visit reefs currently bleaching. “They couldn’t see the whole picture unless they did,” he said. “There should be no whitewashing. They have to see the good and the bad.” Entsch, whose Leichhardt electorate centres on the reef tourism hotspot of Cairns, said he would meet with the mission. “I’ve heard reports of significant bleaching [on some reefs] but also of no bleaching whatsoever. We have to acknowledge the vast area totally unimpacted by this and areas where we have seen magnificent growth [in corals].” Entsch said the mission would be briefed by scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, as well as reef managers at the marine park authority, traditional owner groups and tourism operators. “They will talk to top scientists who have to make the decisions that we base our funding on,” he said. The aerial surveys will confirm if multiple reefs have bleached in at least two of the park’s four management areas, which Wachenfeld said would constitute a “mass bleaching” event. Over a 250km stretch in the reef’s central region, north and south of Townsville, most reefs have bleached severely – where at least 60% of corals on a reef turn white – Wachenfeld said last week. Some corals had already died. Widespread mass bleaching of corals was first seen in 1998, and happened again in 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020. One study has said 98% of the 3,000 individual reefs that make up the entire system have been hit at least once by bleaching. The reef has never seen widespread bleaching in a La Niña year before – the phase of a cycle of ocean temperatures in the Pacific that should keep the region cool enough for corals to escape bleaching. Unesco and the Morrison government have kept details about the mission under wraps. It is being carried out by one scientist from Unesco and another from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Guardian Australia has confirmed the first formal briefings took place on Monday and Tuesday inside the Queensland government’s offices in Brisbane. On Tuesday, Greenpeace staged a protest outside. Representatives were briefed from four reef advisory groups that include scientific experts, community and industry stakeholders, tourism operators and traditional owners. A spokesperson for the Queensland Resources Council – the mining industry’s main lobby – confirmed its chief executive and former Liberal National resources minister, Ian Macfarlane, had been part of those private briefings. The head of oceans at WWF Australia, Richard Leck, was also in the briefing, but said government officials had said Unesco requested “details of the mission be kept confidential”. Leck said he didn’t know if the mission would visit any bleached reefs, but that it was crucial it did. “The fact there’s a bleaching event at the same time as the mission is here means it’s of utmost importance that Unesco witnesses the damage that climate change is causing right now on the Great Barrier Reef,” Leck said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Greenpeace Australia Pacific said it has been asking the government since December for a slot to meet the mission, but climate campaigner Martin Zavan said the group had been “dismissed or ignored”. “We’re important stakeholders,” Zavan said. “It’s very important the mission gets to see what’s happening on the reef, with bleaching now in a La Niña year.” The custodian of Lady Elliot Island and manager of the resort on the island, Peter Gash, said mission scientists would have an overnight stay, tour the island’s major reforestation project and see corals. He said there had been “virtually no bleaching” on the island’s reefs this year. A major long-term project to replant almost all the island’s trees cleared by guano miners in the 19th century had seen major improvements to the health of the corals that fringe the shore. A Unesco spokesperson declined to give any further details on the mission, or say if it would visit bleached reefs.",News/Environment,"UN mission must see coral bleaching to get ‘whole picture’ of Great Barrier Reef, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/un-mission-must-see-coral-bleaching-to-get-whole-picture-of-great-barrier-reef-experts-say
