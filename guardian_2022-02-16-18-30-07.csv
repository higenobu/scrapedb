2/16/2022,"Australia’s domestic spy chief, Mike Burgess, has declared the weaponisation of national security is “not helpful to us” after extraordinary scenes in federal parliament where Scott Morrison labelled a senior Labor frontbencher a “Manchurian candidate”. With Morrison ramping up the partisan rhetoric about risks to Australia’s sovereignty, the Asio director general told the ABC on Wednesday night the risk of foreign interference was “equal opportunity”. These risks affected all members of parliament, he told the 7.30 program, “so it doesn’t go after one particular party or the other”.  Asked whether the current politicisation of national security was helpful to Asio’s work, Burgess said: “I’ll leave the politics to the politicians. But I’m very clear with everyone that I need to be that that’s not helpful for us.” The second forthright public intervention by Burgess in three days followed an ugly partisan confrontation in question time, with the prime minister branding the deputy Labor leader, Richard Marles, a “Manchurian candidate” before withdrawing the slur, and declaring the Chinese government had “picked their horse” in the coming election. The phrase “Manchurian candidate” refers to a politician being used as a puppet by an enemy power. Before using the insult, Morrison cited a speech by Marles in Beijing in 2019 calling for Australia and China to seek to build their relationship “not just in economic terms, but also through exploring political cooperation and even defence cooperation”. While Morrison and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, are attempting to use the penultimate sitting week of the current parliament to paint Labor as weak on national security and at risk of capture by the authoritarian regime in Beijing, the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has struck a noticeably different tone over the past 48 hours. As the partisan rhetoric escalated in the House of Representatives, Payne used an appearance before a Senate estimates committee to deliver a nuanced message. She noted bipartisanship on foreign policy was “overwhelmingly preferable” and noted the parliament is united in support of Ukraine. The government has this week attempted to wedge Labor by reviving legislation to strengthen the character test – a proposal that gives the immigration minister more power to cancel visas. Labor on Wednesday attempted to defuse the fight by signalling it would pass the bill in the House of Representatives despite its concerns about the proposal. There are only a handful of Senate sitting days left before the federal election. The immigration minister, Alex Hawke, said the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was attempting to move the bill to the Senate “when you know we have run out of time to pass the bill” – an observation begging the question why the Coalition had revived a measure it didn’t have time to legislate. Morrison said candidly in Tuesday’s regular Coalition party room meeting the character test bill presented the best point of contrast with Labor in the government’s legislative arsenal. It highlighted the “risks” associated with any change of government. Morrison told parliament on Wednesday he would “never be the preferred partner” of a foreign government that had sought to intimidate and threaten Australia. The escalating attacks on Labor came hours after a senior foreign affairs official warned that Beijing would seek to sow divisions among Australians. Morrison said there was only one side of politics that had demonstrated its resolve to deal strongly with China. “And I can tell you the arbiter of that is the Chinese government themselves who has picked their horse and he’s sitting right there,” he said, pointing to Albanese. Albanese sought to suspend standing orders to trigger an immediate debate on “the national security of Australia” in which the prime minister would make a 10-minute statement followed by a reply from the opposition leader. The government blocked the idea, with the leader of the house, Peter Dutton, saying he would not indulge “stunts”. Dutton had also used a question time appearance to cast doubt over Labor’s stated support for the Aukus partnership, in which the US and the UK have pledged to help Australia acquire nuclear-propelled submarines and to cooperate on security more broadly. The prime minister and other Coalition MPs seized on op-ed published by the Chinese Communist party-controlled Global Times newspaper, in which a retired Australian diplomat said Albanese would be a “safe” but not “charismatic” leader who “positively shines” in comparison with Morrison. Morrison said the Australian government had “earned the respect of nations around the world” for its “resolve” and “resistance”. He said China would “not find a fellow traveller when it comes to threats and coercion against Australia in my government”. “I will never be their candidate.” The febrile tone of the political attacks contrasted with evidence given in a Senate estimates committee hearing on Wednesday. Justin Hayhurst, a senior official at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said: “I think, senator, it’s fair to say that the Chinese system seeks to exploit social and other divisions in countries to pursue its interests – that’s very apparent.” Payne – who has not repeated Morrison’s claims that a Labor government would “appease” China – said she always assured Australia’s allies and partners “of Australia’s strength and resilience and of the basic positions and values that we hold”. Asked if she assured those partners about bipartisan foreign policy settings, Payne said she was “pleased” that Albanese and the shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, had met with the US secretary of state and the foreign ministers of Japan and India in Melbourne last week. “I’m sure that that message was strongly delivered,” Payne said. Under questioning from the Labor senator Kristina Keneally, Payne agreed that national security should normally be outside the “rough and tumble” of politics, but she said the government was entitled to raise questions about Labor’s lack of consistency on policy issues over the past few years. Payne said “the entire parliament, frankly, to the best of my knowledge, is united on respecting, acknowledging and emphasising the importance of the sovereignty and territorial integrity” of Ukraine amid threats from Russia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Keneally said she was “heartened” by Payne’s answers because they indicated the minister retained “a commitment to bipartisanship on national security and foreign policy matters”. The government frontbencher Stuart Robert declined two opportunities on Wednesday to repeat Morrison’s claim that Labor would “appease” China. Robert said he thought the prime minister “has made it very clear that if you look at Labor’s track record, it is appalling”.",News/Australia news,"Politicising of national security ‘not helpful’, Asio spy chief says as Scott Morrison ramps up attack",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/politicising-of-national-security-not-helpful-asio-spy-chief-says-as-scott-morrison-ramps-up-attack
2/16/2022,"With its colourful beach huts and quaint high street, Whitstable is a tourist mecca in the school holidays. But the pile of shopping bags in the Canterbury and District food bank tells a different story about real life in the picturesque Kent seaside town. The nearly 200 bags, with extra treats such as leftover chocolate advent calendars poking out, are ready to hand out at 22 local schools before half-term as, amid a worsening cost of living crisis, they know some children might go hungry without school dinners.  But soaring inflation is not just hurting the finances of local residents, it is having a dramatic impact on those of the food bank. Demand for its food parcels is at a record high and it has gone from spending nothing on groceries to £3,000 a month to cover the shortfall in donations. But not only is the charity having to dig into its own pockets, each pound is not going as far as it used to, as the price of everyday foods – from fruit juice to pasta, biscuits, breakfast cereal and long-life milk – climbs up. The cost of the groceries in one of its standard parcels (enough to feed one person for three days) has increased by 71p – nearly 6% – to £12.64 since December, as a wave of new year price rises arrived on supermarket shelves. Some of the increases look small – 3p on a packet of bourbon biscuits or 5p on a box of cornflakes – but are big hikes relative to the price tag of what are the cheapest staples the charity can find the high street. This is one of the reasons anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe says the cost of living crisis for the country’s poorest households is underestimated in official data. The food bank’s shopping basket provides a proxy for that experience. Peter Taylor-Gooby, professor of social policy at the University of Kent, who is also one of the charity’s trustees, estimates that the cost of its standard food parcel rose by 6.5% in 2020 and more than 7% in 2021, while the consumer price index – the official measure of inflation targeted by the Bank of England – rose in comparison by 1.2% and 5.4%. The price increases for other products in its parcels don’t even look small. The price of a 340g tin of corned beef has risen 32p to £1.79, an increase of more than a fifth. Orange juice is up 16p to 75p, or more than 25%. A bag of fusilli pasta is up 10p to 49p. “We rely on public donations and they have dropped as the price of food has gone up,” explains Angela Gardiner, the food bank’s operations director. “So at a time when people are struggling because the cost of food is rising, our supporters are struggling to buy food to give us.” In the cramped office on the second floor of the food bank’s small business unit, hidden away on an industrial estate on the edge of Whitstable, the number of calls fielded by Jennie Connolly, who works part-time as a “signposter”, continues to rise. In the runup to Christmas the increase was “exponential” and has “not gone down”, she says. The callers, drawn from Whitstable, Canterbury and Herne Bay, as well as the surrounding villages, have little in common, she says – apart from the need for food, of course. The charity estimates three-quarters are either in work or short-term unemployed. “They may have lost their job and are waiting for the first universal credit claim, which can take five to eight weeks in some cases,” explains Connolly. Some of the calls are, she says, very distressing. “People are desperate.” Her job is to give callers “signposting” information, directing them to other agencies who might be able to offer additional support. It is difficult with pensioners, she confesses, because “there are not many places you can signpost them to”. The pandemic has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of Britons claiming universal credit, up from 3 million in March 2020 to 5.8 million today (having fallen back from last year’s peak of 6 million). In Kent and Medway, 13.5% of the working age population are on universal credit, which is roughly the same as for the country as a whole. “The numbers of people on universal credit went up by about two times in the first couple of weeks of the pandemic and they have stayed high, so the background here is real need,” says Taylor-Gooby. “I think we’ve kept pace but what has happened is that poverty has gone up.” The charity noticed a spike in demand last autumn when the government withdrew the £20-a-week universal credit uplift, a move described as the largest ever overnight cut in benefits. This was a “double whammy” for households, suggests Connolly, because people “lost £20 plus the cost of living was going up”. The charity has 100 bins dotted in local supermarkets, church halls and schools and these donation points used to deliver enough groceries to keep the shelves in its warehouse full. These days though, like on your supermarket shelves, there are gaps. “It didn’t used to look like this, it used to be absolutely crammed full,” says Gardiner, pointing to areas of bare shelf. She estimates donations are half pre-pandemic levels. “There is a constant worry about whether we are going to have enough food to put in the parcels.” “Everyone is feeling the pinch,” offers one of the volunteers busily organising its new stock deliveries. The food bank’s need to source large quantities of groceries from retailers and wholesalers brings with it new logistical challenges. Indeed Aldi is the only local supermarket willing to accept bulk orders. We spent “virtually zilch” on food before the pandemic, explains Martin Ward, the charity’s chair of trustees. “There was this balance between what came in through the donation bins and what was going out.” But those days are long gone and the numbers involved make uncomfortable reading for the charity. In the year to July 2019, it was spending about £500 a year on food, plugging shortages of milk and fruit juice, but by the following summer the upheaval caused by Covid helped that figure swell to £12,800. This year it has forecast that its food bill will come to about £35,000. “We spent 10 times more in the first six weeks of the pandemic than we had done in the previous four years,” says Ward. “There has been a steady month-on-month increase … and now it is about £3,000.” But can a small food bank, run by a handful of staff and nearly 200 volunteers, keep papering over widening social cracks? Last week Morgan Wild, head of policy at Citizens Advice, told MPs that demand for crisis support, including referrals for food banks, are at a record high, and that is before higher energy bill tariffs kick in. In Whitstable, the charity’s finances have held up thanks to local generosity and other fundraising work, and to date it has been able to expand its service to meet the growing need on its doorstep. As Ward puts it: “We march forward in faith.”",News/Business,‘People are desperate’: Kent food bank and families hit hard by inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/16/people-are-desperate-kent-food-bank-and-families-hit-hard-by-inflation

2/16/2022,"Ejaculated is a tough word to place in a novel, these days. Nobody uses it to describe dialogue any more and in a sexual context it seems a little functional. Also, for technical reasons, it is tricky to employ from a female point of view. So the reader really does notice when Sheila Heti’s narrator says that something has been ejaculated into her “by the universe” and that something, which is now “spreading all the way through her, the way cum feels”, is the spirit of her much-loved, just‑dead father. But each to her own – you have to admire the leap.  I was pulled into Pure Colour, Heti’s follow-up to 2018’s Motherhood, by a description of life before the internet that held a nostalgia I needed to name. Mira begins the novel in a world now lost to us: it was a time when choice was limited and things stayed particular. This was before seasons became “postmodern”, before we knew that “there were so many ways of being hated, and one could be hated by so many people”. In those days you could see a certain lamp in a shop and know it was your favourite lamp of all time, and “your friends were simply who was around”. This was how it was for Mira going to a college that is, in this emblematic universe, called “the American Academy of American Critics”. With a group of these random, particular friends, Mira visits a woman’s apartment. It is evening and the windows “just reflected back their sorry faces, while on the outside was the watery night”. The apartment belongs to Annie, who is an orphan, and Mira falls in love with her for reasons she cannot explain: “A person can waste their whole life, without even meaning to, all because another person has a really great face.” The friends disperse, Mira goes home to her ailing father, and when he dies, the book becomes fully strange. As his spirit departs his body, it enters Mira and it is as though all her deficiencies have been filled up – “all her sorry spaces, all her spiritual empties”. Despite this, Mira feels his absence keenly. Death has turned the world inside out. It is not as though the dead go into a different room; her life has been transformed into a different room, where she is now trapped without him. One day Mira returns to a tree they both liked and she enters a leaf. She then stays in the leaf for another 40 pages or so – which is a long time in a book, but perhaps a short time to be in a leaf, beyond all desiring, and in the company of your dead father, who is also entirely contented. During this sojourn, Mira considers art, God, love and the transmigration of souls. We are living, she says, in the first draft of the world, which will be rewritten by God any day soon. Not many people will make it into the next draft, which will have fewer mistakes and be less exciting. Meanwhile, “Here we are, just living in the credits at the end of the movie. Everyone wants to see their name up on the screen.” Pure Colour is the apocalypse written as trance, a sleepwalker’s song about the end of all things. And although the book is full of regret for all that will be lost, there is solace in the idea that we will, mostly, die together. The problem with death was never mortality, but timing. If I were not a reviewer but a friend, I would press this book into your hand, and say, “It’s a bit mad, but I think you will like it.” Then I might change the subject for a while, because the truth is that Pure Colour will not be for everyone. It spends a lot of time in a leaf. It is relentlessly abstract. And it’s not actually mad, it is a mystical text with its own (not entirely rigorous, but who cares about that) system or cosmology. The mysticism runs close to poetry and owes, I suspect, more to Kabbalism than to the Christian tradition. Mira is more uplifted than ecstatic: her visions are lightly ironic, fully human and endearing. Apart from the ejaculation thing (itself oddly unsexual), love in the book is desexualised. You might even call it “post-sexual”, if you wanted to talk about female writers, in these anxious days, moving beyond the body to ideas of universal love, or even of God. Mira finds her way out of the leaf and back into the pursuit of love. Her conclusions are about the importance of family and tradition – a surprisingly conventional answer, which feels like a return. Like a lot of mystics, she prefers vegetable to animal life and is wary of human reproduction. Of mothers (there is no mother in Mira’s life), she says: “Until they pushed a person out of their dirtiest parts, they had no one they could truly love, and no one who could truly love them.” This is, in many ways, the opposite of what I think about reproduction, but this is a novel that is happy to compass contradictions. It is a system, not an opinion. It is a philosophical tale. There is also Heti’s lovely prose to enjoy, her beautifully sustained tone, the way she is, as a writer, earnest, funny and sweet. Pure Colour is an original, a book that says something new for our difficult times. It’s a bit mad, but I think you will like it.  Actress by Anne Enright is published by Vintage.
