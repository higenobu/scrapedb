2/23/2022,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday brought a formal end to former President Donald Trump's request to block the release of White House records sought by the Democratic-led congressional panel investigating last year's deadly attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. The court's decision to formally reject Trump's appeal follows its Jan. 19 order that led to the documents being handed over to the House of Representatives investigative committee by the federal agency that stores government and historical records. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Dec. 9 upheld a lower court ruling that Trump had no basis to challenge President Joe Biden's decision to allow the records to be handed over to the House of Representatives select committee. Trump then appealed to the Supreme Court Trump and his allies have waged an ongoing legal battle with the House select committee seeking to block access to documents and witnesses. Trump has sought to invoke a legal principle known as executive privilege, which protects the confidentially of some internal White House communications, a stance rejected by lower courts. The House committee has said it needed the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021. His supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump. The committee asked the National Archives to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers. Biden, who took office two weeks after the riot, previously determined that the records, which belong to the executive branch, should not be subject to executive privilege.

2/23/2022,"On Anderson Cooper 360 Tuesday, Russian expatriate and critic of Vladimir Putin, Garry Kasparov appeared to speak about his home country’s invasion of Ukraine. While at the moment the invasion is relatively small in scale, the fact that Putin ordered nuclear exercises ahead of the invasion caused Kasparov to question the Russian leader’s mental state. “I think that now he reached a point where he's not listening to [the] voice of wisdom in his immediate entourage, and I think his view about the world is sick,” Kasparov said. “That makes the situation even more dramatic…Let's not forget, Putin has his finger on a nuclear button. Though I think we're far from the moment where he could consider it, but the fact is that he talked about it is sending a signal that he lost the sense of reality.” As part of a long and rambling speech on Monday, Putin questioned Ukraine’s statehood, and recognized two regions of Ukraine as independent territories. Russian troops were soon on the ground in those territories. Kasparov believes this marks the end of the post-WWII world order. “What is happening now is we are witnessing the end of the post-WWII order. International security and cooperation was based on the core principles of territorial integrity,” Kasparov said, adding, “Now Putin demonstrated to all the thugs and dictators and terrorists around the world that borders can be ignored if you have enough strength, and the free world had no power to stop you, if you are brazen and swift.”",Politics/Yahoo Entertainment,Russian expat Garry Kasparov says Putin has lost his 'sense of reality',https://news.yahoo.com/russian-expat-garry-kasparov-says-075849581.html
2/23/2022,"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan is ""not Ukraine"" and has always been an inalienable part of China, China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday, as Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called for the island to beef up vigilance on military activities in response to the crisis. The comments come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson flagged the risk for Taiwan in a warning last week about the damaging worldwide consequences if Western nations failed to fulfil their promises to support Ukraine's independence. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up military activity near the self-governing island over the past two years, though Taiwan has reported no recent unusual manoeuvres by Chinese forces as tension over Ukraine has spiked. Speaking in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying dismissed any link between the issues of Ukraine and Taiwan. ""Taiwan is not Ukraine,"" she said. ""Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. This is an indisputable legal and historical fact."" The issue of Taiwan is one left over from the civil war, but China's integrity should never have been compromised and never has been compromised, Hua added. The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the civil war to the Communists, who set up the People's Republic of China. Taiwan's government strongly opposes China's territorial claims. Tsai says Taiwan is an independent state called the Republic of China, which remains Taiwan's official name. All security and military units ""must raise their surveillance and early warning of military developments around the Taiwan Strait,"" Tsai told a meeting of the working group on the Ukraine crisis set up by her National Security Council. Taiwan and Ukraine are fundamentally different in terms of geostrategy, geography and international supply chains, she added, in details of the meeting provided by her office. ""But in the face of foreign forces intending to manipulate the situation in Ukraine and affect the morale of Taiwanese society, all government units must strengthen the prevention of cognitive warfare launched by foreign forces and local collaborators,"" it cited Tsai as saying. The statement did not mention China by name, but the country is the most significant military threat that Taiwan faces. Tsai has expressed ""empathy"" for Ukraine's situation because of the military threat the island faces from China.
