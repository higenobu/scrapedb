2/2/2022,"Peter van Onselen, the political editor of Network Ten, has denied undermining and humiliating the network’s federal political reporter, Tegan George, and says the federal court case will show that he is a strong advocate for wiping out sexual harassment in the workplace. “No, no, absolutely not,” he said when asked by the ABC’s Virginia Trioli on Melbourne radio whether he bullied George, who reported to him in the Canberra bureau. “And when process plays out, I’ll be able to respond to it all through Channel 10. But I just can’t talk about it publicly. Now that it’s a court proceeding.”  Van Onselen denied he had a “woman problem” and said the case will show that his behaviour in the workplace was the “exact opposite”. While saying he couldn’t talk about the details in the statement of claim revealed by Guardian Australia on Tuesday, Van Onselen claimed that a key matter raised by George would show that he does not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace. “Well, actually on this one, the statement, which has been leaked publicly, one of the complaints is that I didn’t tolerate, if you like, non-cooperation with an incident that involved alleged sexual harassment within the office … which I wanted to be dealt with,” he said. “And I’m looking forward to Channel 10 defending [the claim], which they are doing but I just can’t speak publicly about it, unfortunately.” Van Onselen was referencing a claim by George that she was threatened with disciplinary action by Network Ten management when she resisted making a formal statement about an alleged sexist remark that she had overheard. The statement of claim said she was pressured into making a formal statement after she “overheard a conversation in Network Ten’s parliament house bureau between a Network Ten employee and a freelance camera operator in which a sexist remark was made about another employee”. George’s legal counsel, Maurice Blackburn principal Josh Bornstein, said his client “overheard snippets of a conversation between two colleagues which contained sexist remarks and reported it to a manager”. “Any suggestion that Ms George refused or failed to report an incident of sexual harassment is false,” Bornstein said on Wednesday after the ABC interview. In the claim George claimed Van Onselen backgrounded journalists against her and tweeted about “employees who witness” sexual harassment but did not report it, a tweet she believed was directed at her. “I’m talking about witnesses not victims,” Van Onselen said in another tweet, quoted in the claim. “Especially when an employer makes clear they want to stamp it out, but a witness covers up for a colleague they are close to, for example”. Well said @latingle on the need for positive obligations on employers to deal with workplace sexual harassment. When it happens it must be called out. There should also be obligations on employees who witness it to report it, not cover it up. A columnist for the Australian and an academic, Van Onselen has been one of George’s bosses in the Canberra bureau since 2019 and she alleges she suffered “hurt, humiliation and distress” in the workplace and has been on sick leave since June last year. She names a number of senior executives at the network in her claim, including Van Onselen. Trioli also quizzed him regarding his headline making question to Scott Morrison at the National Press Club about text messages between Gladys Berejiklian and an unnamed senior Liberal. The prime minister was blindsided by a claim that leaked texts between a party colleague and the former New South Wales premier included her calling the prime minister a “horrible person” who was untrustworthy.

So do you and the prime minister have this in common?” “I can’t talk about that. As much as I would love to,” Van Onselen said. “Because it is not public.” In her lawsuit, George claims Van Onselen variously used Twitter, Ten group emails and WhatsApp messages to undermine her. The federal court released the originating application to the media on Wednesday but held back the statement of claim. The originating application says George is claiming that Ten contravened the Fair Work Act and should “pay a pecuniary penalty for each contravention”. Ten, which is the only respondent, is yet to file its defence in the federal court.",News/Media,Peter van Onselen denies having a ‘woman problem’ and humiliating reporter Tegan George,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/02/peter-van-onselen-denies-having-woman-problem-and-humiliating-reporter-tegan-george
2/2/2022,"US talkshow host and actor Whoopi Goldberg has been suspended from The View for two weeks for saying the Holocaust “isn’t about race” on Monday’s episode. Her suspension from the The View was announced in a statement released by US network ABC News on Tuesday night, after Goldberg issued a public apology.  “Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments,” Kim Godwin, president of ABC News, wrote in the statement. “While Whoopi has apologised, I’ve asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact of her comments. The entire ABC News organisation stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family and communities.” Goldberg has yet to comment on her suspension. Variety reported that the decision to suspend Goldberg was made in consultation with the highest tiers of management at Disney, which owns ABC News. Goldberg made the comments during a discussion about a Tennessee school board’s decision to ban the Pulitzer prize-winning Holocaust graphic novel Maus. “Let’s be truthful, the Holocaust isn’t about race, it’s not. It’s about man’s inhumanity to man, that’s what it’s about. These are two groups of white people,” she said on The View on Monday. She continued: “You’re missing the point … let’s talk about it for what it really is. It’s about how people treat each other. It’s a problem. It doesn’t matter if you’re black or white, Jews … everybody eats each other.” The Auschwitz Memorial and StopAntisemitism.org are among organisations that have condemned her comments, with Jonathan Greenblatt from the Anti-Defamation League calling her comments “dangerous”. The Nazis regarded Jewish people as an inferior race, and a threat to Aryan Germans. Racist ideology was used to justify the annihilation of anyone with Jewish heritage, regardless of their religious belief and practice. Hitler himself described Jewish people as a race, not a religion, in Mein Kampf. In a statement posted on Twitter the same day, Goldberg offered her “sincerest apologies”. She wrote: “On today’s show I said the Holocaust ‘is not about race, but about man’s inhumanity to man’. I should have said it is about both … I stand corrected. “The Jewish people around the world have always had my support and that will never (waver). I am sorry for the hurt I have caused.” After her apology, Greenblatt publicly thanked Goldberg for “acknowledging the Holocaust for what it was”. He then appeared with Goldberg during the start of Tuesday’s episode of The View, during which she again apologised.",Arts/Culture,Whoopi Goldberg suspended from The View after saying Holocaust ‘isn’t about race’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-after-saying-holocaust-isnt-about-race
