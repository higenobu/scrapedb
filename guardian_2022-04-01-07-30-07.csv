4/1/2022,"Covid-19 vaccines provide significant extra protection for people who have already been infected, according to two new studies. The jabs have proven highly effective in protecting those who have never had Covid, but their effectiveness at preventing symptoms and severe outcomes in people who have previously been infected has, until recently, been less clear. Now two separate pieces of research, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, confirm that Covid-19 vaccines provide additional protection for people who have already been infected with Sars-CoV-2 – especially against severe disease.In the first study, conducted in Brazil, researchers found that four vaccines – CoronaVac, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Janssen and Pfizer/BioNTech – provide extra protection against symptomatic reinfection and severe outcomes such as hospitalisation and death in people who had previously caught coronavirus.The second study, from Sweden, found that vaccination against Covid-19 provided additional protection to those who had had Covid before, for at least nine months.Together, the studies provide crucial data on vaccine effectiveness in people with a prior infection and underline the benefits of getting vaccinated regardless of whether someone has had Covid. Experts say the findings could also help inform global vaccine strategies.“Covid-19 vaccines have been proven to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic infection and hospitalisation among those with no prior infection but effectiveness for those with prior infection is less clear,” said the author of the first study, Julio Croda, of Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul and Fundação. “Understanding the duration and effectiveness of immunity for those vaccinated with a previous Covid-19 diagnosis becomes increasingly important as the pandemic progresses and surges … new cases may occur as a result of more transmissible variants. Further research on the need for vaccination for those with a previous Covid-19 infection is a vital step to pandemic policy intervention including guidance on single dose or two dose vaccine protection.”In the first study, which involved more than 22,000 people who became reinfected with Covid, the data showed that being vaccinated reduced their risk of symptoms, being hospitalised or dying.“All four of these vaccines have proven to provide significant extra protection for those with a previous Covid-19 infection, reducing hospitalisation and death,” said Croda. “There has been ongoing public debate about whether previously infected individuals need to be vaccinated. Our results suggest that vaccine benefits far outweigh any potential risk and support the case for vaccination, including the full vaccine series, among individuals with prior Sars-CoV-2 infection.”Writing in the same journal, Pramod Kumar Garg, of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, India, who was not involved in the study, said: “The results of [the Brazil] study and other recent studies challenge the concept of population-level herd immunity through natural infection alone against Sars-CoV-2 and suggest that vaccinating individuals who were previously infected provides further protection, particularly against severe disease. These data should help guide policy decisions and mitigate vaccine hesitancy among people who had Sars-CoV-2 infection.”The second study, involving almost 3 million people, found that one vaccine dose in someone with infection-driven immunity from a previous infection lowered their risk of reinfection by 58% two months after the jab. Two doses of vaccine lowered the risk of infection by 66%.The authors acknowledged limitations with both studies, including a risk of bias due to the observational nature of the research. Additionally, neither study included an analysis of reinfection from the Omicron variants.Writing in the same journal, Jennifer Juno, of the University of Melbourne, Australia, who was not involved in either study, said: “These data confirm, in a large cohort, the added protective benefit of vaccination among individuals recovered from Covid-19.”",News/World news,"Covid vaccines give extra protection to previously infected, studies show",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/covid-vaccines-give-extra-protection-to-previously-infected-studies-show
4/1/2022,"Rishi Sunak has compared himself to Will Smith as the chancellor defended his wife against criticism over financial links to Russia, saying: “At least I didn’t get up and slap anybody.” Sunak has come under mounting pressure over accusations that his wife is collecting “blood money” in dividends from a family company that continues to operate in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC’s Newscast after a challenging week in which his spring statement also met heavy criticism, he said it was “very upsetting and … wrong for people to try and come at my wife”. Sunak drew parallels with Smith, who hit the comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars on Sunday after a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, as well as the beleaguered England cricket captain, Joe Root. The chancellor quipped: “Someone said, ‘Joe Root, Will Smith, and me – not the best of weekends for any of us’. But I feel, on reflection, both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked – at least I didn’t get up and slap anybody, which is good.” Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murthy, who keeps a low public profile, is the daughter of the billionaire founder of Indian tech giant Infosys. According to its latest annual report, Murthy holds a stake in the firm worth approximately £690m, which is estimated to have yielded £11.5m in dividend payments over the past year. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised Sunak over his wife’s investment in the firm, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, calling it “really quite shocking”. Asked about such comments, Sunak said: “You know, I think it’s totally fine for people to take shots at me. It’s fair game … It’s very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my wife.” He also defended his father-in-law, the Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, saying he had “nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he’s achieved, and no amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he’s wonderful and has achieved a huge amount. As I said, I’m enormously proud of him.” Sunak has urged British countries to withdraw from Russia to “inflict maximum economic pain” on Vladimir Putin’s regime but the Indian government has been more ambivalent in its attitude to the invasion. The ministerial code says that ministers must declare any financial interests that could give rise to a conflict, including those of their spouse and close family. A spokesperson for the chancellor has said Murthy and her family members do not “have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company”. Responding to the criticism earlier this week, Infosys issued a statement saying it had “a small team of employees based out of Russia, that services some of our global clients, locally”. “We do not have any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises,” the company said, adding that it had committed $1m (£0.76m) to help the victims of the war. Sunak’s lifestyle has come under growing scrutiny as the cost of living crisis has become more pressing. He was ridiculed last week for a staged photo opportunity after the spring statement, in which he filled up a Kia car belonging to a supermarket worker. The chancellor met Murthy when the couple were both studying at Stanford University and they still have an apartment in California, as well as a large property in his Richmond, North Yorkshire, constituency.",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak likens himself to Will Smith in defence of his wife,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/31/rishi-sunak-likens-himself-to-will-smith-in-defence-of-his-wife
