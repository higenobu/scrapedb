4/28/2022,"The unavoidable truth looming over Europe’s response to the invasion of Ukraine is that Russian gas heats the continent’s homes and powers its industries. While European leaders have vowed to wean themselves off Kremlin-controlled supplies, both of gas and oil, the reality is that this is very hard to do in short order. There will be at least one more cold winter to come before major energy-hungry economies that rely heavily on Russia, such as Germany and Italy, can tap other sources. Knowing this, Vladimir Putin fired a shot across the bows this week. Having issued a decree that foreign buyers must start paying for their gas in roubles, he made Poland and Bulgaria the laboratory mice for the experiment. Both countries, the Kremlin announced, would no longer be receiving Russian gas through the Yamal pipeline from Siberia after they refused to accede to the demand. The decision could usher in a new phase of the war, with Russia making good on Putin’s threat to use its vast gas reserves as a weapon against Europe. The two countries appear to have been chosen carefully. Poland gets about 45% of its natural gas from Russia, according to 2020 figures from Eurostat. That’s not sky-high by European standards but Poland happens to be among the countries that have been most politically and militarily supportive of Ukraine. Bulgaria poses less of a threat to the Russian war effort but is more reliant on its gas, which accounts for about 73% of demand. Targeting these two countries allows Putin to test the power of his resource weapon on two different types of opponents – one that poses a genuine threat and another that looks more vulnerable and could serve as a salutary lesson to others in a similar position. Both have said they can and the facts appear to bear that out. Poland’s contract with Gazprom is up at the end of the year anyway and it has been investing in alternative sources for some time. “Poland is right next to Germany and can import from there,” said Tom Marzec-Manser, the lead European gas analyst at the energy consultancy ICIS. “It has its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal and has a new pipeline coming indirectly from Norway, online later this year. It has also built up storage, half expecting that this might happen.” Bulgaria’s situation is slightly less favourable but it does have a second pipeline connection to Greece coming on stream later this year. A Bulgarian entity recently booked an LNG cargo to arrive at a Greek port, one analyst told the Guardian. This could signal a plan to source supply from elsewhere. As Marzec-Manser points out, Putin has made it clear his threat to cut off gas supplies to “unfriendly” countries, unless they pay in roubles, was not totally empty. “There is proof it wasn’t a bluff,” he said. The move means countries and companies that buy Russia’s gas have a decision to make about whether they agree to pay in its currency . Hungary, which has proved a rare European friend to the Kremlin, has already said it will toe the Russian line. At least four private companies have agreed to the Kremlin’s demands, according to Bloomberg. Latvia, which got 100% of its gas from Russia in 2020, has vowed along with Lithuania and Estonia to stop buying any. An LNG import terminal in Lithuania is a key alternative, particularly for these relatively small economies – the first in Europe to end Russian imports. The European Commission has said countries should not pay in roubles, and that complying with Russia’s request could breach EU sanctions. However, under Russia’s demands, payments would be made to Gazprombank in euros or dollars, before being converted. In theory, this would still breach sanctions. But last week the commission indicated contracts could be tweaked to make them compliant. This could be good news for major economies such as Italy and Germany. The latter gets 60% of its gas from Russia and has said it will take a while to reduce that to zero. A lot will depend on whether Russia escalates. The Dutch TTF price for gas delivery in May, a benchmark for Europe, began the week at €92 and touched €115 on Wednesday, a rise of 20%, in response to the Kremlin cutting off Poland and Bulgaria. The price settled back to $107 as of Wednesday afternoon, still 15% above the level at the start of the week. While UK energy suppliers buy on the British wholesale market, over time any rise in European prices will hit UK companies too, which could lead to higher prices for UK consumers. However, for a much greater shockwave to go through Europe, huge gas buyers such as Italy’s Eni and Germany’s Uniper would have to be cut off. That would have a huge impact on Russian revenues and it seems likely that some form of compromise on payments, like the EC has hinted at, is more likely.",News/Business,How worried should Europe be as Russia starts cutting off gas supplies?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/how-worried-should-europe-be-russia-starts-cutting-off-gas-supplies
4/28/2022,"The cabinet has been discussing ways of lessening the burden on families and individuals struggling amid the cost of living crisis, in particular by coming up with “non-fiscal” proposals that do not involve increasing taxes. They include ideas which have been put forward by Boris Johnson, and others that have already been in circulation. This proposal was said to have come from the prime minister, who was reported to have suggested lowering legal requirements in England stipulating that there must be at least one member of staff for every three children in groups aged two years and under. Pros: Many nurseries have found themselves stretched in terms of staffing and having to bring in agency workers. Parents and guardians have had to foot the bill in terms of increased fees. Cons: Looking after a group of toddlers can be a challenging, perhaps at times terrifying, task for any number of carers. The idea only helps parents with children under three years. The coalition government abandoned plans to lower child-to-staff ratios. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is said to have suggested reducing the need for an annual MOT. Currently MOTs must be carried out on every vehicle that is three years old or over. Pros: Avoiding the need to renew an MOT certificate could save drivers up to £54.85 for a car and £29.65 for a standard motorcycle. Cons: The idea is all very good in practice until a car is involved in an accident and someone gets killed. The AA also opposes it on the basis that it would still lead to increased bills from repairs. Food stuffs from overseas, such as rice and oranges, would be among those which might come down in price at supermarkets if tariffs were lifted. Pros: The move could save under-pressure consumers if cost savings were directly passed on. Unlike other ideas, the savings might be universally felt, including by lower income families who have cut back on supplies that many take for granted. Cons: Leverage in Britain’s trade negotiations would be removed, a reason why the idea is reported to be facing resistance from the international trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan. The charges, which are used to fund renewable energy schemes, are opposed by Tory backbenchers and sections of the rightwing press, though the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has held the line. Pros: The levy add £153 to the average energy bill. Officials were reportedly examining if the levy could be phased out gradually or simply dropped by the autumn when bills are expected to rocket. Cons: Johnson has already said that green, sustainable, electricity can help to reduce bills “Grey market goods” are branded products that are imported into a market and sold without the trademark owner’s consent. It is not illegal, but sellers need to apply for a licence in what can be a bureaucratic process. Pros: The cost of branded clothing and electrical goods, such as smartphones, might come down by cutting up red tape to allow more “parallel imports”. Cons: Not an idea which helps the most deprived families, who are struggling to feed themselves, let alone purchase consumer goods. About £15bn of benefits are believed to go unclaimed each year. This includes 1.3m families who do not take up an offer of up to £2,000 a year for childcare costs. Other savings cover those living alone who are unaware they could due a single-person discount on council tax – calculated on the assumption that two adults live in a property – and get 25% off their bill. Pros: A campaign to inform the wider public of unclaimed benefits could be a relatively low-cost way of tackling the cost of living crisis. Cons: The sight of resources going into a public relations campaign will be of no benefit to lower-income families who are barely surviving despite making the most of any benefits they are already entitled to. Experts also describe as “sketchy” government data supporting suggestions that much support goes unclaimed. Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the efficiencies minister, were reportedly among the most vocal of those suggesting that tax cuts remain the best way of helping struggling members of the public. Pros: Wriggle room exists if figures released this week are anything to go. HMRC collected £718.2bn in taxes in the last financial year, an increase of almost a quarter from the year before, while National Insurance, capital gains and inheritance tax takes all reached record highs. Cons: Despite pressure from colleagues, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was said to be particularly conscious of inflationary risks; during cabinet discussions No 10 said that he “underlined the importance of not feeding in to further inflation rises, and emphasised that the UK is currently spending £80bn servicing our debt”. A tax cut would also leave a hole in spending plans.",News/Business,Cost of living: the pros and cons of ministers’ ideas to ease crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/cost-of-living-crisis-the-pros-and-cons-of-ministers-ideas
4/28/2022,"Canada’s effort to phase out open-pen salmon farms has hit a roadblock after a federal judge said farmers had been blindsided by a government order to shut down. Federal court judge Elizabeth Heneghan ruled earlier this month that former fisheries minister Bernadette Jordan had failed to grant farm operators the right to procedural fairness when she announced plans to phase out the farms, and criticized the minister’s lack of clarity surrounding the controversial decision that companies said would cost them millions in losses. In December 2020, Jordan announced that 19 salmon farms in the Discovery Islands, a region off the coast of British Columbia, would be shut down by 2022. She also said that no transfer of fish between hatcheries and the open-pen farms would be allowed during the 18-month phase-out period. In response to the order, salmon farmers have started shutting down their operations in the Discovery Islands – but have also fought the orders in court. In ordering the closure of the farms, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party was acting on the advice of a government commission into the decline of wild sockeye salmon. The Cohen commission found in 2012 that the Discovery Islands functioned as a bottleneck along salmon migration routes – and that closing the farms would reduce risk to wild salmon. Nine government reports, however, found the farms posed minimal risk to the wild salmon. “[Farmers] submit that they were not given notice of the scope of the decision nor notice that transfer licences would be banned,” Heneghan wrote in her decision, calling the minister’s response to concerns “inadequate”. The judge said that for a decision that would cost the companies millions in losses, the fisheries minister owed the companies a through explanation for her decision. “A news release does not provide reasons. A news release is a means for a person … to express a viewpoint of opinion. The consequences of the decision in this case are significant and the minister owed a duty to provide reasons.” Fish farming has become a flashpoint between environmental activists, First Nations leaders and farmers, but the recent ruling is a blow to Trudeau’s pledge to phase out the industry in the region by 2025. In March, the First Nations Wild Salmon Alliance urged the government to continue working to close the farms, blaming “fragmented management decisions at both the federal and provincial levels” for the “precarious extinction-level state of wild salmon”. Last month, the premier of British Columbia warned the prime minister that closures without a clear transition plan would “undermine the economies of dozens of communities” in the region. In closing the farms, Canada would have been one of the first countries in the world to force a shift from open-pen farming to closed water systems. In the United States, both Alaska and Washington state have looked to reign in fish farms amid growing concerns that the farmed salmon could pose a risk to ailing wild salmon stock. Last month, a newly released Canadian government report showed that for nearly a decade, its own scientists were concerned that farmed Atlantic salmon were a vector for spreading the highly contagious Piscine orthoreovirus. Heneghan’s ruling also enforces a previous injunction which permits fish farms to restock salmon until the farms close. The BC Salmon Farmers association said it was “encouraged” by the court decision. A spokesperson for fisheries minister Joyce Murray said she is aware of the court’s ruling and will be making a decision on next steps soon. “[Minister Murray] remains committed to transitioning away from open-net pen salmon farming in coastal British Columbia waters,” said press secretary Claire Teichman.",News/Environment,Canada’s attempt to phase out open-pen salmon farms faces setback,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/27/canada-open-pen-salmon-farms-federal-judge
4/28/2022,"Olivia* was giving up on the idea of ever owning a home. The project coordinator and her partner, a teacher, had opted to try to buy in Ōtautahi Christchurch, where prices were lower than other main centres, and they would be closer to family. “We had a 20% deposit saved, but as the market went up, that 20% got smaller and smaller,” she says. As their deposit portion shrank, the banks became squeamish about lending to them. “Every month that went by, it became more out of reach, because of the speed that house prices were going up.” Finally, Olivia asked for help from her parents, who decided to buy the house on the couple’s behalf. She and her partner gave their deposit to her parents, who – with an existing property of their own – quickly got bank approval. The couple moved in, paying all mortgage payments and costs. A year later, they were established enough to get bank approval for their own mortgage and bought the house from her parents for the same price they’d originally paid. “It was an absolute godsend,” Olivia says. “I’m sitting in our house today and I can’t believe it. We couldn’t afford this house now. It’s gone up astronomically.” Over the past year, value estimates for the property have risen so the house is now worth about $200,000 more than what they paid. “That was the gift my parents gave me – to essentially freeze the market for us,” she says. “We’re incredibly lucky … [But] when we last spoke to the bank manager they said almost nine out 10 people now are in the same position as you: they’re either buying with parental help, or parents are buying on behalf.” New research shows the “bank of mum and dad” now ranks among the top financiers in New Zealand, having doled out an enormous $22.6bn in financial assistance. (The $22bn figure captures all outstanding financial assistance by living parents, compared with the banks’ total current outstanding lending.) If taken as a single block, that puts the country’s parents alongside the major banks as the biggest providers of housing finance in New Zealand. The report, produced by nonprofit research and advocacy body Consumer NZ, found across the country, nearly half of all children who bought a house, or 48%, had support from their parents – with the average contribution being $108,000. In Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, 58% of children who bought a property had family support, and the amounts they gave were $20,000 more than the national average. Since 2018, mortgage brokers have reported that more than 50% of first-time buyers are doing so with the assistance of their parents, with some putting the figure as high as 60-70% and beyond. With average house prices up 30% over the course of 2021, to over $1m, that figure is now likely even higher. The data illustrates the stark realities of New Zealand’s housing market, where high prices mean many younger New Zealanders struggle to get on the property ladder, and assistance from parents has become the norm. It also raises concerns that the country, which has long prided itself on having a softer class system, is shifting to a norm where wealth and housing is concentrated among a landowning class, and those who do not benefit from intergenerational wealth are left without long-term housing or financial security. “Increasingly, only the children of people who own homes will be able to also own homes,” says economist Shamubeel Eaqub. “That half of adults who owned or bought houses did so with help from their parents – that’s an extraordinary number. But it also makes sense, given how crazy our house prices are – the average house price is nearly 10 times average income – so to save a deposit for it is nearly impossible for most people.” “We’ve reached a point in New Zealand where it’s no longer enough to do all ‘the right things’ to buy your first home – to get a job with a good income, save furiously and cut back on the ‘nice to haves’,” says Gemma Rasmussen, head of campaigns and communications at Consumer NZ. “The role of the bank of mum and dad is more pivotal in the first homebuying process, but it also means that we’re seeing a greater social divide of who gets to buy a first home and who does not.” Carolyn Robertson, of Christchurch, says she and her husband were able to buy their home 15 years ago by co-buying with her parents, who already owned a home. They say the inherent inequalities of the market became clear to them through the process of buying: Paul, her husband, was raised by a single mother, whom he says would never have been able to assist in the same way. “I felt a sense of injustice,” he says. “I was super, super grateful for what Caroline’s parents did for us. But I also knew that was never an option for my mum.” “You’ve got to have parents who are financially stable,” says Robertson. “It’s a cruel system. It ingrains inequalities.” Those dynamics are also putting increasing pressure on the country’s parents – some of whom are downsizing and carving into retirement savings to assist their children. Consumer NZ’s research found that of the parents who assisted their children, 62% dipped into their savings, 17% cut back on their own expenses and 17% offered their own home as equity. For one in 10 parents, their financial contribution put them under moderate to serious financial strain – in Auckland, it was almost 20%. Pauline, who works in education in Auckland*, says she and her husband opted to sell the family home and downsize to provide their four children with help for their own deposits. “I feel really strongly about inheritance – I think it’s so bloody stupid to get to the end of your life and leave money to your kids when they don’t need it,” she says. “We could see that housing prices were just going crazy. And we wanted the kids to be able to get into a house.” Pauline says she and her husband had bought their house in the 70s, in a once-undesirable Auckland suburb. By the mid-2000s, it was worth “a ridiculous amount of money”, she says: average house prices in Auckland are now over $1.2m and are 65 times higher than their 1970s level. She says among her peers, giving your children a large chunk of deposit is the new normal. “In our circle of friends, this is what’s happening,” she says. “We were lucky, and our kids are lucky, I wish that it wasn’t that way.” Eaqub says those concerns appear to be becoming more widespread in New Zealand – and are contributing to shifting political consensus that the housing market must change. “This need to help your children means people might be working longer, or living in debt longer, or retiring with debt,” he says. “People are working now not just for their own retirement, but also to help their children buy their homes. There are all sorts of implications in that – it’s like a Ponzi scheme, right? You might be able to help your children – but then how do your children save up enough to help their children?” “I think it’s appalling, it’s frightening,” says Pauline. “I come from a generation where [among] our parents, working-class families could buy a home,” she says. “Now we worry about our grandkids, what will happen to them.” *Olivia and Pauline are referred to by their first names only to protect the privacy of their families.",News/World news,‘It’s like a Ponzi scheme’: New Zealand first homebuyers lean on bank of mum and dad,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/its-like-a-ponzi-scheme-new-zealand-first-homebuyers-lean-on-bank-of-mum-and-dad

The report explains the steps that Amnesty says the company could take to prevent this. In February 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights published a database of “business enterprises involved in certain specified activities related to the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”. JCB is one of the companies listed in this database. In November 2021, UK National Contact Point, which manages complaints about the practices of UK multinational companies in relation to OECD guidelines, found that JCB had failed to carry out due diligence on human rights in its supply chain.

4/28/2022,"The frontrunner in the Philippines presidential race, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, has praised his father – the country’s late dictator – as a “political genius”, and his mother as the dynasty’s “supreme politician”, less than two weeks before an election that could return the Marcos family to power. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, has a clear lead in the polls ahead of an election on 9 May, despite his father’s notorious history. In an interview with CNN Philippines, Marcos Jr praised the political skill of his father and his mother, Imelda: “Even my father I don’t think would object if I say [Imelda] is the supreme politician in the family. My father is the statesman, he is the political genius. “My mother can connect with anyone – from her classmates from I don’t know how many years ago, to the person working in the palengke [wet market], to the queen of England. Everyone becomes her friend,” he said. Marcos was ousted from power in the 1986 People Power Revolution, but the family returned from exile in the 1990s and has over the decades sought to re-establish their place in politics, including by using social media to rebuild their reputation. His son’s campaign and supporters have been accused of seeking to rewrite history, and of coordinated efforts to spread online misinformation and attack opponents. In January, Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts that were promoting Marcos Jr’s campaign for violating its rules on spam and manipulation. Marcos Jr denied the existence of any such organised social media networks. Marcos Jr has denied or downplayed allegations related to his father’s rule. It’s estimated that as much as $10bn was plundered by the family. Under martial law, which was imposed by Marcos in 1972, 34,000 people were tortured, 3,240 people were killed and 70,000 were imprisoned, according to Amnesty International. Imelda Marcos, whose infamous shoe collection became a symbol of the family’s excess, has previously said it was her son’s destiny to become president. However, Marcos Jr said that, while he had consulted his mother over whether to run for president, it was his own decision. Bonifacio Ilagan, who was detained during the rule of Marcos Sr, and who is a convener of the Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law, said it was the Marcos family’s dream “to reclaim their lost glory”. “I will be the last one to believe that the Marcos family is not involved in the scheme to get the Marcoses back in power,” he said. Should Marcos become president, there would be little hope of achieving justice, said Ilagan. “So much of what has happened will be negated in terms of the [People Power Revolution] uprising … It will also mean the victims of the violations of human rights during his father’s dictatorship will never be able to find justice.” While a law has been passed to provide compensation to victims of martial law, funds amassed by the family are yet to be fully recovered. “We still want the Marcoses to return the billions of dollars that they stole from government,” he said.",News/World news,Philippines presidency frontrunner praises ‘genius’ dictator father,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/philippines-presidency-frontrunner-ferdinand-marcos-jr-praises-genius-dictator-father

Beardmore, currently customer service and people director at United Utilities, will succeed Steve Mogford at the top of the FTSE 100 firm. Mogford has spent 12 years leading the company, which services customers in the north-west of England, and plans to step down and retire from the board in early 2023. Her promotion means that of the six chief executives and chairs leading the three water companies whose shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange, five will be women. There are currently just four companies in the FTSE 350 that have both a female chief executive and chair: two of these are the water companies Severn Trent and Pennon. The insurance firms Admiral Group and Direct Line Insurance Group are also led by a female duo. Severn Trent – which is headquartered in Coventry and supplies customers across a region stretching from the Bristol Channel to the Humber, and from mid-Wales to the east Midlands – is led by Liv Garfield and chaired by Christine Hodgson. Pennon, which owns South West Water and Bournemouth Water and is a member of the FTSE 250, is led by chief executive Susan Davy and chaired by Gill Rider. Beardmore will join the United Utilities board at the start of May as CEO designate, and will work with Mogford until his retirement. She said she was “privileged” to have been asked to lead the organisation which supplies 7 million people in the north-west England. “I look forward to working with the team to ensure we continue to provide the service and results our customers and stakeholders deserve and expect,” Beardmore said. United Utilities’ chair, Sir David Higgins, described Beardmore as “the outstanding candidate in a rigorous selection process including internal and external candidates”. Despite efforts by Britain’s top businesses to promote women and meet gender targets, recent reports have found there are still too few women in senior leadership positions. The proportion of women on FTSE 100 boards reached an all-time high in late 2021, according to research by Cranfield School of Management, although the report concluded that there were still not enough female chairs, chief executives and chief financial officers.

4/28/2022,"Conservative MPs have queued up to criticise plans to privatise Channel 4, raising doubts over whether the government has the parliamentary support required to sell the channel. Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the house, told the House of Commons on Wednesday: “Channel 4 is in the best state it’s been creatively and financially for decades.” The Tory MP suggested that ministers may have been offended by some of its news coverage – such as replacing Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture in a climate change debate – and added that the “government could do best by leaving it alone”. Damian Green, another former Tory minister, expressed “profound scepticism” about the government’s privatisation plans and said the media industry was united in “saying Channel 4 isn’t broke and doesn’t need fixing in this way”. The House of Commons heard suggestions that selling the channel could result in regional job losses, undermine the government’s levelling up agenda in cities such as Leeds, and leave the UK with another broadcaster owned by an overseas media company. Channel 4 has an unusual business model devised by Margaret Thatcher’s government, which requires it to commission all of its shows from independent businesses. It operates as a publicly-owned outlet that carries advertising but is required to reinvest its profits into new programming rather than hand over the money to shareholders. Culture minister Julia Lopez said the government has concluded Channel 4 needs private ownership in order to survive, even though almost the entire British media industry is publicly opposed to the plan. Dr Neil Hudson, the Conservative MP for Penrith, said: “Please, please can I urge the government to rethink this Channel 4 privatisation idea. Now is the time to support, bolster our public service broadcasters – not challenge them or leave them to a competitive subscription-based service which is the last thing our rural communities need.” Full details of the government’s proposals to sell the channel will be unveiled on Thursday, along with the results of a 60,000-person public consultation on the issue – which are believed to overwhelmingly oppose privatisation. Potential buyers include ITV or a US media company such as Discovery. Many MPs said the government was misguided in its belief that Channel 4 needed to compete with the likes of Netflix, especially given the streaming service has recently seen a fall in its subscriber numbers and was heavily indebted. A key concern for politicians is the fate of small independent television production companies in their constituencies who fear they will lose out if Channel 4 is sold to a private sector owner. Ian Paisley Jr, a representative of Northern Ireland’s DUP, highlighted the success of the sitcom Derry Girls and the millions of pounds that the broadcaster spent with companies in the region. Labour’s Lucy Powell said Channel 4 could be “gobbled up” by US media companies if sold off and warned the battle over privatisation would “clog up parliament for months to come”.",News/Media,Tory MPs attack plans to privatise Channel 4,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/27/tory-mps-attack-plans-to-privatise-channel-4

In his first public appearance since Sunday’s vote, Macron strolled around a food market in the town of Cergy, north-west of Paris, shaking hands and posing for selfies. Most people were friendly, some shouted congratulations and others asked for help in finding a job, dealing with health problems or making ends meet. But at one point there were briefly boos, and a bag of tomatoes was thrown towards Macron’s back but missed. A bodyguard opened an umbrella to shield the president, who quickly sidestepped the projectile and continued to greet people and shake hands. The Élysée Palace said the trip was Macron’s way of “listening to people’s concerns, expectations and needs”. He told local young people that he wanted to get out on the ground “from the start”. One young woman replied: “Don’t just come here for the photos.” Another onlooker said: “It’s good that he’s getting out of the Élysée.” Macron won a second term at the weekend, beating the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen by 58.5% to her 41.5%, but on the campaign trail he faced accusations of being haughty and aloof and of not understanding people’s concerns about the cost of living, housing, jobs and poverty. He had struggled to shake off the tag of “president of the rich”. Macron said in Cergy: “I want to give a message of respect and consideration to these areas that are among the poorest in the country, right from the start of my mandate.” He acknowledged that deprived, high-rise neighbourhoods surrounding Paris had some of the highest abstention rates in the presidential vote. Macron said “life was hard” there and some people felt angry or cut off from politics, and not enough progress had been made in recent years to improve their lives. He said there were problems of discrimination, and a need for training schemes, more doctors and better health care in these areas, as well as job creation. “We’ve brought down unemployment here, but it’s still above the national average because of discrimination and not enough training,” he said after meeting young local entrepreneurs. Macron, the first French leader to be re-elected for a second term in 20 years, is now focused on parliamentary elections in June. He will need a centrist majority in the 577-seat house in order to put in place his manifesto plans, including overhauling the benefits system and raising the pension age. Pollsters believe he has a good chance of winning a majority. Cergy is a leftwing area where the radical-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon topped the presidential vote’s first round. Mélenchon is attempting to strike alliances with other parties on the left to challenge Macron’s centrists in the parliamentary elections. Mélenchon’s party, La France Insoumise, which has 17 seats in parliament’s lower house, wants to expand by hundreds more to win a majority for the left. The Socialist party and the Greens (EELV) on Wednesday began talks on possible parliamentary alliances with Mélenchon to increase the number of seats on the left. Hurdles remain. The Socialists are traditional rivals to La France Insoumise, and some older Socialists warn against “surrendering” the party’s principles. The Greens favour an alliance, but some Green figures have said they will not compromise on their pro-Europe and anti-nuclear stance.",News/World news,Macron dodges tomatoes in post-election walkabout,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/macron-dodges-tomatoes-in-post-election-walkabout
