3/14/2022,"Robert Richards, who has died aged 65 of cancer, was an important figure in the story of the Glastonbury festival. He worked for the festival’s founder, Michael Eavis, for more than 30 years, and was producer of the 2006 film Glastonbury, directed by Julien Temple. Robert made the film with backing from Eavis’s personal savings, and enlisted Temple to capture every moment of the festival as it happened in 2002 – stretching to 2,000 hours of film. At that point Glastonbury was facing something of a crisis, having suffered break-ins and serious overcrowding the year before, and Eavis had been compelled to put up a controversial “superfence” to keep out intruders. Although it took four years for the film to be released, it remains the defining record of the festival’s first half-century. Born in Finsbury Park, north London, Robert was the son of Ann (nee Platt) and Robert, a design engineer. While at Woodberry Down comprehensive he played rugby for school, county and country. Eventually he decided not to pursue the sport, growing his hair long and hanging around at Finsbury Park’s Rainbow theatre to chat backstage to musicians, among them Eric Clapton and David Bowie. He spent a year at the University of Bristol (1974-75) studying politics, philosophy and economics, but then gave up, switching to do the same subject at City, University of London – and calling it a day after a year there, too. By then Robert had began to make a string of underground films, all of which have since been lost, except one – Krasny: An Introduction to Philosophical Thinking – registered at the BFI in 1999. He also sold candles, and, for a while, tea in Covent Garden. It was a vanload of candles that took him to Glastonbury festival in the early 1990s – he went there to sell them to punters but came back in following years to work for the festival in its information area, initially in the Green Fields section with CND. Later he helped Melvin Benn secure the festival licence and began to work more closely with Eavis as Glastonbury grew to become one of the biggest outdoor events in the world. By then settled in Somerset, he also became involved in the growth of Somerset Film, a charity dedicated to nurturing new film making talent; he was one of the founding trustees in 1999. Aside from his work with the festival he kept goats on a smallholding in Withypool on Exmoor, became a trustee of Glastonbury Abbey and, more recently, chair of the Glastonbury Town Fund Board, which raised £24m for the town in 2021. An astute negotiator, Robert worked closely with the Eavis family and the core festival team on forging new partnerships and opportunities, including a longstanding media partnership with the Guardian that began in 1998 and continues to this day. Robert’s first marriage, to Victoria (nee Thomas), ended in divorce in 2010. He is survived by his second wife, Ann-Marie (nee Buckley), whom he married in 2011, his mother and his sister, Elizabeth.",Arts/Music,Robert Richards obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/13/robert-richards-obituary
3/14/2022,"The Power of the Dog, the story of a troubled family of ranchers in 1920s Montana, is an essay in dysfunction, a film in the business of upending social and generic norms. It is a hugely satisfying, intriguing, stimulating drama with a whiplash of an ending that took us from the realm of alt-western to alt-body horror. It was this film’s mythic quality, its dreamlike knight’s-move away from the world generally represented in westerns, that no doubt resonated with Bafta voters, who awarded it best film and gave best director for the increasingly celebrated Jane Campion. On an evening that celebrated dissident, revisionist westerns, the outstanding debut prize went to the ultraviolent gonzo revenge movie The Harder They Fall, starring Jonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz and Idris Elba. It is a headbangingly, flesh-splatteringly freaky debut from Jeymes Samuel that reclaims the African-American side of the genre. The drumbeat of brutality became a bit too uniform for me, but it it stylishly made. Denis Villeneuve’s colossal science fiction adventure Dune, taken from Frank Herbert’s classic novel, is a big film in every way and appropriately it was a huge winner at last night’s Baftas, including for Hans Zimmer’s thrumming musical score. This was a movie that benefited from the reopening of cinemas, a movie about a doomed colonial tyranny on a mineral-rich planet, a movie whose ineffable vastness has to be experienced on the big screen. These awards feel like justice, although they might reinforce the impression that Dune was a cloudy impressionistic experience: one giant visual effect whose actual narrative is fading in the memory. But it’s a massively audacious film and part of a vibrant tradition of epic movies. I was very pleased to Kenneth Branagh’s enormously warm – subversively warm – movie Belfast pick up best British film, and maybe it’s a measure of how emollient this movie is that labelling a film about the Troubles as “British"" isn’t as controversial as it might have been. This is a film whose streak of sentimentality has alienated some: some Belfast-dwellers have written it off as inauthentic, others from Belfast have found it entirely real. I personally responded to its richness and heartfelt humanity. As far as the acting prizes went, Joanna Scanlan’s Bafta for best actress in the fascinating After Love was a reward for work of the very highest quality: a complex, painfully real and honest study of a woman who makes terrible discoveries about her husband after he has died. It is a career-best for Scanlan, and hugely well deserved. Will Smith’s best actor Bafta for King Richard (beating the early favourite, Benedict Cumberbatch for The Power of the Dog) was a testament to his old-fashioned movie-star potency and an emotional connection to movie audiences. It’s impossible to overstate just how much warmth Smith can generate in the right role – and this was one was the juiciest. The crowdpleasing heart-of-gold dramedy Coda (remade from the French film La Famille Bélier) had a really good night with wins for best adapted screenplay and supporting actor. It is a film about a young hearing girl with hearing-impaired parents: a “CODA” or “child of deaf adults”. It’s a movie widely felt to be well-intentioned if a tad micro-engineered – perhaps this was a movie that played well on streaming video with Bafta voters at home. Ariana DeBose was a thoroughly deserving winner of the best supporting actress prize for her fiercely engaged and theatrically exuberant performance in Spielberg’s West Side Story. Elsewhere, it was good to see Paul Thomas Anderson win best original screenplay for his satirically outrageous and gorgeously atmospheric age-gap comedy Licorice Pizza, set in 70s LA. It deserved more, but this unclassifiably brilliant film was always in danger of slipping through the cracks entirely. And it was pleasing to see Ryu Hamaguchi’s wonderfully intelligent Murakami adaptation Drive My Car named as best foreign-language film. I was sad to see nothing for Guillermo del Toro’s noir thriller Nightmare Alley (a film superior to his much prize-garlanded The Shape of Water) and nothing for Joel Coen’s outstanding version of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. But this was a well-judged and satisfying Bafta list of winners.",Arts/Film,Jane Campion leads roll-call of worthy winners as Baftas hit all the right notes | Peter Bradshaw,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/13/jane-campion-winners-2022-baftas-hit-all-the-right-notes
3/14/2022,"Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, who has died aged 97, was the founder of the Open University’s publishing division, to which she recruited (among many others) me and my colleague John Pettit. She was also, with Michael Turner, co-translator of Hergé’s Tintin books, and in this capacity her name is known to Tintin fans throughout the English-speaking world. Born in Northwood, Middlesex, Leslie was the daughter of Nora (nee Briggs) and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, a retired lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy. Her first name (with its unusual spelling for a female) commemorates her father’s distinguished military career and his untimely death shortly before Leslie was born. After going to the Royal Naval school in south London, she attended Miss Kerr-Sanders’ Secretarial College. Towards the end of the second world war she found herself working for the US justice department in London, Paris and Frankfurt, and in this role she helped with preparations for the Nuremberg war crimes trials. Back in civilian life, Leslie’s secretarial skills took her into publishing – initially at Collins, where she then trained as an editor. Following a move to Methuen, where she became a rights specialist, she met Turner and with him began translating the Tintin stories, a project that continued for three decades. “Translation” in this context meant rendering Hergé’s Brussels slang into English utterances that could be fitted into the speech bubbles of Hergé’s original drawings. Leslie was especially proud of their invented Tintinian oaths, such as “blistering barnacles!” In 1970 Leslie joined the newly created Open University in Milton Keynes as a rights specialist – a move that inaugurated the happiest period of her life. She saw that, in order to produce high-quality educational materials, the university needed to recruit editors, graphic designers and other specialists to work alongside the academic authors. Soon she was managing a growing number of professional editors and rights specialists, which became the university’s publishing division. After retirement in 1987, Leslie remained in the Milton Keynes area at her beloved cottage in Wicken in Northamptonshire, where she was active in church and village life. She is survived by seven nephews and nieces.",Arts/Culture,Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/13/leslie-lonsdale-cooper-obituary
