4/3/2022,"For decades, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett maintained a pretty conservative approach to investing, favoring retail and banking stocks while giving a wide berth to more volatile sectors such as tech and energy. However, he finally pulled the trigger on PetroChina Co. (NYSE:PTR) in 2002 and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2011. The Oracle's foray into energy and tech initially paid off after he realized a tidy $3.5B profit on PetroChina, while his $158 billion Apple stake now represents a ridiculous 47% of Berkshire Hathaway's $330B equity portfolio. Buffett's later energy buys, such as Suncor Energy Inc. (TSX:SU) (NYSE:SU), Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D), and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) have all been bought at bargain prices. Lately, however, Buffett appears to be deviating from his famous ethos of buying stocks with a decent margin of safety. After all, he has been doubling down on his energy investments while trimming his tech and banking holdings despite oil and gas stocks being at multi-year high valuations while tech stocks are decidedly cheaper. To wit, the legendary investor has added new shares in red-hot E&P companies Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) and Chevron Inc. (NYSE:CVX) despite both currently trading at multi-year highs. According to Berkshire's latest 13F filing, the company bought 118.3M OXY shares in multiple transactions from March 12 to March 16, bringing its stake in OXY to 136.4M shares, or ~14.6% of its shares outstanding. Berkshire also owns OXY warrants granting the right to acquire some 83.9M additional common shares at about $59.62 each, plus another 100,000 OXY preferred shares. Earlier, Berkshire revealed that it purchased about 9.4 million shares of oil titan Chevron in the fourth quarter, boosting its stake to 38 million shares currently worth $6.2 billion. OXY has more than doubled over the past 12 months while CVX is up 55%, with both stocks trading at multi-year highs. But, obviously, Buffet thinks they still have plenty of upside, judging by the huge positions opened by his investment conglomerate. Buffett is hardly alone. A few days ago,Â OXY CEO Vicki Hollub bought a chunk of the company's shares on the open market, even as shares trade near three-year highs. According to an SEC filing, Hollub paid $798K on March 28 for 14,191 OXY shares at an average price of $56.24, raising her holdings to 467,282 shares and an additional 23,390 shares through a savings plan. Hollub last bought OXY shares on the open market nearly three years ago, when she paid $1.8M for 37,460 shares at an average $48.15/share on June 10, 2019. Wall Street is enthralled by OXY, too. Raymond James analyst John Freeman recently raised his OXY price target to $85 from $60, setting a new Wall Street high. That's good for nearly 50% upside. OXY has 9 Strong Buy ratings, 2 Buy, 13 Hold, 1 Sell, and 1 String Sell ratings on Wall Street. Meanwhile, Shale player APA Corp. (NYSE:APA) has popped to a 52-week high after Mizuho upgraded shares to Buy from Neutral with a $56 price target, up from $38, saying the company is in a ""unique spot"" among oil and gas producers. Mizuho says APA has a ""clear plan for 10%-plus cash return 2022-24 at current oil prices along with near-term growth (Egypt) and longer-term development (Suriname) catalysts outside the U.S."" ESG-driven pessimism Buffett has been loading up on energy giant Occidental just as the company's stock price has been soaring as oil prices take off due to the Russia-Ukraine War and sanctions against Moscow. Although western governments have encouraged the continued flow of Russian energy to global markets since the war in Ukraine began, numerous nations are self-sanctioning. The U.S. has completely banned energy imports from Russia; UK plans to phase out oil and gas imports by year-end, while the EU has pledged to cut energy imports by two-thirds by year-end. Poland has become the latest to join European nations shunning Russian energy commodities after saying it will stop oil and coal imports by the end of the year. Poland is a major thoroughfare for Russian energy supplies, directly consuming ~330kb/d of Russian crude (CO1:COM) and is also home to the ~1.3mb/d Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude to several points in Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Further, Poland imported ~9.4mt of Russian thermal coal in 2020, accounting for ~5% of Russian exports. And, make no mistake about it: the oil markets are likely to remain undersupplied for years to come, whether the Ukraine crisis is quickly resolved or not, thanks in large part to years of underinvestment amid the ESG boom. Big deficits According to the leading energy experts, the oil markets will almost certainly face huge deficits that could last for years. In its March 16 report, the IEA warned of a potential global oil supply shock, with ~3 million b/d of Russian oil production likely to be shut-in in April. The Paris-based watchdog also projects lower demand growth for 2022 by 1.1 million b/d to 2.1 million b/d, thanks to reduced Russian consumption and higher prices. The main reductions in the IEA growth forecast by country were Russia (430kb/d), the U.S. (180kb/d) and China (70kb/d). Related: OPEC Sees Smaller Oil Supply Surplus For Q1 2022 However, the EIA is more conservative than the IEA in cutting its 2022 forecast by 415kb/d to 3.13mb/d and increasing its 2023 forecast by 77kb/d to 1.95mb/d. While acknowledging the scale of the potential demand risks, the OPEC Secretariat has maintained its 2022 demand growth forecast at 4.15mb/d. Meanwhile, commodity expert Standard Chartered has become even more pessimistic about the Russian outlook. In its March 9 report, StanChart lowered its 2022 forecast to 1.94mb/d, nearly a million b/d lower than its February forecast. StanChart says ongoing sanctions, continuing consumer reluctance to buy from Russia, as well as shortages of capital, equipment, and technology, will continue to depress Russian output over--at least--the next three years. The commodity experts have predicted that Russia's output decline will peak at 2.306mb/d in Q2-2022. StanChart says that rebalancing the oil markets would require around 2mb/d extra supply for the remainder of 2022, mainly due to the current very low inventory levels, and an additional 2mb/d in Q2 to ease the dislocations caused by the displacement of Russian oil. StanChart's model assumes that the current OPEC+ deal continues, no increase in Iran's exports, and U.S. output growth Y/Y is just over 1.5mb/d. But here's the main kicker from the StanChart report: only OPEC can bridge the big supply deficit. StanChart estimates that an Iran deal could potentially provide an extra 1.2mb/d in H2-2022, still leaving a significant gap that can only be realistically filled by those OPEC members with spare capacity, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE. And, prospects for a sharp increase in U.S. shale production are not looking great at the moment. And, even Biden's latest checkmate is likely to end up being a mere band-aid. After months of deliberation, the Biden administration has finally authorized the release of an unprecedented 1 million barrels per day from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for the next six months. ""The scale of this release is unprecedented: the world has never had a release of oil reserves at this 1 million per day rate for this length of time. This record release will provide a historic amount of supply to serve as a bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up,"" the White House has said in a release. The 180mb release appears to come entirely from the US reserve, with the U.S. counting on its allies to release an additional 30mb-50mb of oil from their reserves. But as Roger Read, senior energy analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, has noted, Biden's planned daily release from the SPR works out to only 1% of daily global production and 5% of U.S consumption. ""I don't want to make it sound like it's nothing, but you just arrive at the issue where we may be off a lot more than just 1 million barrels. So it helps, but it's unlikely to solve the problem. In the end, it's a little bit of a Band Aid and I think a little bit of hoping to get later in the year OPEC catch up,"" Read has told CNBC. Additionally, the President has called on Congress to pass legislation designed to incentivize energy companies to drill on public lands, applying a ""use it or lose it"" strategy. The White House has criticized the domestic energy industry for ""sitting on"" more than 12 million acres of federal land and 9,000 unused but already approved permits for production. But it will probably take a lot more to coax higher production from long-suffering U.S. producers. A recent survey by the Dallas Fed has found that Big Oil intends to grow its median crude production by a mere 6% Y/Y while smaller firms are aiming to expand theirs by 15%. But it's not all about the money this time around: 41% of respondents believe the WTI price between $80 and $99/bbl is enough to boost production growth; an additional 20% believe $100 to $119 is sufficient, while a small portion said $120/bbl or higher. Nearly one-third of the respondents (29%) said growth would not be dependent on the price of oil. In fact, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) CEO Ryan Lance says oil prices are so high that ""we are encroaching upon the area of demand destruction."" Rather, more than half of the respondents have attributed the restraint in growth to investor pressure to maintain capital discipline, indicating some hard lessons were learned over the past few years. Given this backdrop, it's not surprising that Warren Buffett has abandoned his well-known investment mantra of being fearful when others are greedy and greedy when they are fearful and paid heed to Sir Winston Churchill's admonition to never let a good crisis go to waste. A final note: oil stocks remain undervalued, with the S&P energy sector still lagging far behind its 2014 levels from the last time oil crossed $100 per barrel.

4/3/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds distrust it, a clutch of strategists say itâs doomed, and the Federal Reserve probably wishes it would stop. But a fearsome stock market rally that has been giving prognosticators fits is refusing to go away. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Kyiv Warns Russia Is Adding Troops in Moldova China Finds New Virus Subtype as Daily Cases Exceed 13,000 Russia Says Ukraine Choppers Made Rare Cross-Border Strike Ukraine Update: U.S. Steps Up Military, Defense Assistance Trump Rallies in Michigan to Put His Stamp on Republican Primary A final-hour surge Friday salvaged a third straight up week for the S&P 500 -- barely -- extending a run for U.S. equities that at times has ranked among the strongest in the past decade. The benchmark gauge has retraced well over half its tumble since the start of the year, a shock to institutional traders who spent most of the last three months slashing risk. âA lot of people sold on the way down and then this quick surge, theyâve missed out on it,â Craig Callahan, chief executive officer at Icon Advisers Inc., said by phone. âSo I think theyâre trying to discredit it, sort of saying, âwell I didnât get in on it, it must not be real.ââ The case for skepticism remains an easy one to make. Besides war in Europe, this weekâs jobs and inflation data reinforced the argument for a faster Fed tightening cycle. The bond market is flashing warnings over an economic recession. And the earnings-reporting season due to start in two weeks is expected to show a drastic slowdown in corporate profits. Among investors surprised when the S&P 500 jumped more than 10% over 11 sessions through Tuesday were hedge funds. Those tracked by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unwound their risky bets -- cutting longs and covering shorts -- in 15 of the first 21 trading sessions of March. By Tuesday, the dollar amount of their de-risking was poised for the second-largest monthly reduction in five years -- behind only the Reddit-fueled short squeeze in January 2021, according to data from the firmâs prime broker. The pattern was echoed at JPMorgan Chase & Co., whose hedge fund clients also sold into the latest rally. âWeâve just seen a very sharp rebound in equities that seems to have caught many by surprise, and which few seem willing to embrace as a potentially persisting trend,â JPMorgan analysts including John Schlegel wrote in a note. âFrom a positioning/flows perspective, it seems the âpain tradeâ is still higher for now.â Buoyant markets can also be framed as mixed news for central bankers, who aim to tighten financial conditions as one way to cool demand and tame inflation. The S&P 500 started rallying the day before the Fedâs decision to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018. When Chair Jerome Powell hardened his stance a week later, stocks marched on, contributing to an easing in the Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index. âThe market signal was that the Fedâs behind the curve. The Fed is telling the market, âhey, we can afford to be patient,ââ said Benjamin Dunn, chief operating officer at Prometheus Alternative Investments. âThe real tone of market participants right now is one of exhaustion. This was such a difficult quarter for investors.â Getting louder on Wall Street is the drumbeat of warnings over a bear market trap. Strategists at firms from Bank of America Corp. to Morgan Stanley urged investors not to chase the gain, citing everything from an inversion in Treasury yield curves to stretched valuations and potentially disappointing earnings. At 20 times profit, the S&P 500 trades at a valuation multiple that before the 2020 pandemic had been seen only once in the past two decades -- during the dot-com era. Meanwhile, the cushion from corporate profits is thinning out. Profit growth is expected to slow to roughly 6% in the first quarter, down from an average pace of 54% last year, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. âThe Fed is tightening aggressively, profit margins will start to deteriorate and thatâs the end of the cycle,â Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV with Guy Johnson and Kailey Leinz. âWhile we donât think there is a recession this year, the risk of a recession next year has gone up dramatically.â Recessions are threats that bull markets have not been able to survive historically. Increasingly, cash is the favored asset among the pros. In BofAâs March survey of money managers, such holdings rose to the highest level since April 2020. Carin Pai, head of portfolio management and equity strategy at Fiduciary Trust International, which has around $103 billion in assets under management and administration, is currently overweight cash. She and her team -- amid the recent rally -- raised cash by selling equities. âWe didnât want to sell into the downdraft in January, but with this recovery recently, we did take some money out of equities,â she said.
