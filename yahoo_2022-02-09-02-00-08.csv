2/9/2022,"I tested the 2022 Ford Maverick, Ford's new, inexpensive pickup that retails for $19,995 to start. The small, hybrid truck is a great value, but it still has its weak points. The Maverick's fuel economy and price stand out. Its sluggish engine and interior comfort fall short. The 2022 Maverick is Ford's newest and smallest truck. And by many measures, it's awesome. But even the best vehicles have their shortcomings. I tested out the cheapest Maverick model — the $19,995 Maverick XL — for a weekend in December. Here are seven pros and cons to consider before you buy.   The lowest-tier Maverick XL starts at $19,995 before fees, making it the cheapest pickup in the US and Ford's lowest-cost offering. More functional and more interesting than most inexpensive sedans and SUVs, the Maverick may just be the most appealing economy model on the market. The mid-tier Maverick XLT starts at $22,360, while the top-trim Maverick Lariat commands $25,860.   That low base price is a double-edged sword. It means you may need to pay for a higher trim level and options package to get all the features you really want. My bare-bones tester lacked convenience and safety features that come standard on many cars — think cruise control and power mirrors. But given the Maverick XL's bargain-bin price, that makes sense. Even on higher trim levels, you need to shell out for a luxury or driver-assistance bundle to get things like heated seats, power seats, adaptive cruise control, and rear parking sensors. The roughly $24,000 Hyundai Santa Cruz, the Maverick's main rival, offers more standard comforts and safety tech. The hybrid Maverick offers 42 mpg in the city, 33 on the highway, and 37 combined, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That's great for any vehicle (it beats the 2022 Honda Civic) and is especially excellent in the world of pickup trucks. I spent almost five hours driving 250 miles and didn't use even half a tank.   The issue with that highly efficient powertrain? It won't be taking you anywhere fast. While the 191-horsepower electric-and-gas setup is perky around town, it struggles at higher speeds. It gets there, but the process is slow and loud. If you want to sacrifice fuel economy for better passing power and all-wheel drive, upgrade to the optional 250-horsepower, turbocharged engine.   Clever little storage nooks abound in the Maverick. There's a little cubby by the infotainment screen and another receptacle on the dash. Neither of these are very big, but they could hold some sunglasses or a wallet. Below the screen, there's a spot for your phone (with optional wireless charging). The Maverick has plenty of cupholders, including oversized ones in the doors. Under the rear seats, you'll find a couple of cargo bins, which come in especially handy in a vehicle without a trunk.   In my review of the Maverick, I commended Ford for making the truck's interior not feel too cheap. It has interesting textures and funky molded plastics that exude more character than you might expect from an entry-level model. But the Maverick XL's interior still isn't all that comfy. There's a lot of wind noise at highway speeds, and I found the front seat uncomfortable for long trips. I love what Ford did with the cabin materials, but they're hard plastics nonetheless.   The Maverick brings lots of the functionality of a larger truck without feeling big or unwieldy. Quite the opposite: The Maverick's stubby proportions and low ride height mean it's easy to chuck around a parking lot or parallel park. In a full-size pickup like the Ford F-150, that's easier said than done. Read the original article on Business Insider",Business/Business Insider,"I drove the $20,000 Ford Maverick.

2/9/2022,"Student-loan company Navient reached a $1.8 billion settlement with 39 attorneys general. Sens. Warren, Van Hollen, and Blumenthal urged the Education Department to promptly deliver that relief. They also want the department to go further and relieve borrowers beyond the settlement scope. One of the largest student-loan companies in the US has to give billions in relief to borrowers through a settlement. Three Democratic lawmakers want that relief distributed promptly — and then some. In a Tuesday letter provided exclusively to Insider, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, and Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal are asking Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to promptly deliver the $1.85 billion in relief for student-loan borrowers through a settlement reached between student-loan processor Navient and 39 attorneys general on behalf of borrowers who were victims of ""predatory"" practices. They also want Cardona's Education Department to go even further ""to use its tools to make things right for Navient's victims,"" given the terms of the settlement will not address the full scope of borrowers harmed by the company's misleading practices. ""The Navient settlement comes at a critical time,"" the lawmakers wrote in their letter. ""While ED (Education Department) made the right decision to extend the student loan payment pause through May 1, 2022, about half of all federal student borrowers are at risk of falling behind on their loans once monthly payments resume. It is urgent that ED take action to redress Navient's victims for the full scope of the financial injury they experienced."" Student-loan payments have been on pause for nearly two years during the pandemic, and in that time, three student-loan companies — including Navient — announced they would be ending their federal servicing contracts. While Navient has consistently denied wrongdoing over accusations of abusive behavior, lawmakers like Warren have held the company in their sights for decades to ensure its debt collection practices aren't contributing to the growing $1.7 trillion student debt crisis. The lawmakers asked Cardona in the letter for information on how many borrowers might not receive relief through the settlement, along with a detailed response on how the department plans to ensure all borrowers harmed by Navient will get relief. They want answers by February 22. As Insider previously reported, Navient reached a settlement with 39 states' attorneys general in mid-January to resolve allegations of ""widespread unfair, deceptive, and abusive student loan servicing practices and abuses in originating predatory student loans,"" according to a press release. As part of the settlement, Navient will cancel $1.7 billion for 66,000 borrowers with private student loans, and it will distribute $95 million in restitution payments — about $260 each — to about 350,000 federal borrowers who were placed in long-term forbearances. While Warren lauded the relief at the time, writing on Twitter that the settlement is ""a major step to deliver relief for borrowers & hold Navient accountable,"" she has spent decades working ot hold not only Navient, but all student-loan companies, accountable for actions that mislead borrowers and push them into more student debt than they can pay off. When Navient announced in July it would be ending its federal loan servicing contract this year, Warren told Insider the student-loan industry would be ""far better off"" without them. She also told its CEO Jack Remondi in April that he should be fired for the abuses that happened under his leadership, such as a 2018 audit Warren released that provided evidence of Navient's record of ""steering student borrowers into forbearance when that was often the worst financial option for them."" The lawmakers wrote in the letter that in total, only 66,000 borrowers — just 0.05% of all borrowers whose loans were under Navient — are eligible for loan forgiveness through the settlement, and they want Biden to ensure everyone who deserves relief gets it. ""For years, Navient engaged in widespread unfair and deceptive student loan servicing practices and abuses in originating predatory student loans while the Department of Education (ED) turned a blind eye,"" they wrote. ""ED has a responsibility to all borrowers harmed by Navient's abusive practices and we urge you to move quickly to supplement the settlement against Navient with additional relief for borrowers.""

2/9/2022,"Trump left the White House in a hurry after being obsessed with trying to overturn the election. Trump did, however, manage to take at least 15 boxes of official White House records with him. The National Archives is in the processing of recovering the boxes from Mar-a-Lago. Former President Donald Trump rushed to leave the White House last year, as he spent his final weeks in office obsessed and consumed with trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, The New York Times reported. Several books on the final days of the Trump presidency recounted how many of the president's aides and advisers had left the White House entirely or had largely checked out of the action by the end of his term. The staff departures created a vacuum for figures like Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other conspiracy theory-wielding figures like attorney Sidney Powell to try to convince him of quixotic ways that he could stay in power. ""At the time,"" The Times wrote, the aides who remained ""were either preoccupied with helping him overturn the election, trying to stop him or avoiding him."" Trump did, however, manage to take multiple boxes of important records and documents out of the White House and back to Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach, Florida club and winter residence. His lawyers have been in negotiations with the National Archives for the boxes of records to be returned to the agency's custody. Both The Times and the Washington Post reported that Trump carted off over a dozen boxes of White House materials, records, and other items that he should have turned over under the Presidential Records Act. The law requires White House officials to properly preserve official presidential correspondence and documentation, like memos, letters, emails, text messages, and social media postings. Some of the items in the boxes, according to The Times and The Post, included letters to Trump from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, a note from former President Barack Obama, a map that Trump drew on with a Sharpie to mark a possible hurricane path to Alabama, and at least one piece of clothing. Experts told the Post that Trump likely violated the 1970s law, passed in the wake of Watergate, by taking the documents back to Florida with him. The Archives confirmed in a Monday statement that the agency had ""arranged transport"" for 15 boxes of records and materials to be returned from Mar-a-Lago into the agency's custody. It added that Trump and his staff are ""continuing to search for additional Presidential records that belong to the National Archives."" Archivist David Ferriero emphasized in the statement that compliance with the Act is ""critical to our democracy, in which government is accountable to the people,"" and that ""there should be no question as to the need for diligence and vigilance."" A spokesperson for Trump didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The agency, however, has few to no tools at its disposal to enforce violations of the Act and other federal record-keeping laws. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight, said she would open an investigation into the Trump administration's lack of compliance with federal records laws. Improperly transporting official materials back to Mar-a-Lago isn't the only way that Trump and his staff reportedly flouted federal record-keeping laws. Trump's well-known habit of tearing up official White House documents to destroy or dispose of them, a trend Politico first reported on in 2018, is now impacting the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. The Archives, which has turned over at least 700 documents from the Trump White House, previously told the Post that some of them ""included paper records that had been torn up by former President Trump."" Some documents that had been torn up, they said, weren't taped back together at all. In addition to routinely tearing up documents in the Trump White House, officials would round up documents in ""burn bags"" and send them to the Pentagon to be incinerated, the Post reported.
