2/21/2022,"The Liberal party’s federal preselection woes in New South Wales have worsened, with action launched in the NSW supreme court on Monday and one preselection candidate at risk of withdrawing from politics altogether. NSW state MP Melanie Gibbons has indicated she may quit politics if she’s unsuccessful in gaining preselection for the seat of Hughes, which could trigger a byelection and plunge the NSW government further into minority government.  Factional organisers were again discussing a way through the legal and constitutional crisis, with plans for a NSW state executive meeting on Friday. If a solution cannot be found, the most likely result will be a federal takeover of the troubled branch. That decision will be made on 3 March. Gibbons, the state MP for Holsworthy, in Sydney’s south has reportedly been approached about a number of jobs outside politics. She previously worked in the disability sector. Her resignation would trigger a byelection which would put renewed pressure on the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and potentially plunge the NSW government further into minority government. Gibbons did not return calls, but is understood to be frustrated with the party’s ongoing refusal to hold a branch preselection in the overlapping federal seat of Hughes. Gibbons has the backing of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and believes she has the numbers to win. Instead NSW party powerbrokers are intending to parachute in Alex Dore, a former Young Liberal president, who lives in Manly, as part of a complex deal to share the remaining winnable federal seats among the factions. However to cement the deal, negotiators require a 90% vote of the 27- strong state executive, which has not been forthcoming. Meanwhile The Australian reported on Monday that a member of the NSW state executive, Matthew Camenzeuli, had filed documents in the supreme court of NSW seeking to challenge advice about the state executive’s imminent demise and force the party to follow the constitution which calls for rank and file preselection ballots. The summons is directed to the key office holders in the Liberal party: Immigration minister, Alex Hawke, who represents the prime minister on the NSW vetting committee for candidates; Phillip Ruddock, a former Howard government minister, who is now president of the NSW branch, and John Olsen, who is president of the national Liberal party. The NSW state director, Chris Stone, last week presented the division with legal advice suggesting federal party intervention was required to reappoint members of the state executive until the party’s postponed annual general meeting was held in March. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The division eventually agreed on Thursday to request a limited federal intervention that would see the existing state executive reappointed. But when the federal executive, led by Scott Morrison, met on Thursday night, it instead issued a warning to the state executive to endorse three sitting MPs by 28 February or face a wider takeover. Camenzeuli is one of a group of state executive members that strongly supports the Liberal party holding branch plebiscites as specified in the constitution, under what are known as the Warringah rules. “Mr Camenzuli seeks declaratory relief confirming that the members of the State Executive will continue to hold office until the next AGM (annual general meeting) of the Division presently scheduled for 27 March 2022,” the affidavit said. Camenzeuli claims Hawke’s failure to make himself available for vetting processes was in breach of his own obligations and responsibilities to the Liberal party’s constitution. He has been widely blamed by members of state executive for holding up the NSW preselections. Hawke did not return calls. The NSW Liberal party declined to comment, citing ongoing legal matters. Meanwhile state factional organisers are desperately trying to convene a meeting of state executive for this Friday, and assemble enough support for the factional deal to ward off federal intervention. The federal executive deferred a decision on federal intervention to effectively take over the troubled NSW branch until 3 March. The escalating crisis is now threatening to derail the Liberal party’s federal campaign in NSW, with several seats yet to have an endorsed Liberal candidate. They include North Sydney, Farrer, Mitchell, Dobell, Warringah, Hughes, Bennelong and Parramatta.",News/Australia news,NSW Liberal party factional turmoil escalates to supreme court action ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/nsw-liberal-party-factional-turmoil-escalates-to-supreme-court-action
2/21/2022,"Australia’s plateauing Covid-19 vaccination rates among 5-to-11-year-olds will be discussed at a round table of federal and state government representatives and public health experts on Friday. The round table is being convened by vaccine uptake expert Prof Julie Leask, with less than 50% of Australia’s 5-to-11-year-olds having received their first Covid-19 vaccine dose.  “I’m bringing together a group of people to present data to government, and governments will also have the chance to present some of their data in a closed session to get to the bottom of these vaccination rates and to see what sort of barriers there are for parents and caregivers,” Leask, who works with the University of Sydney’s Institute of Infectious Diseases, said. “We already have gaps in coverage between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal 5-to-11-year-olds, and we’re likely to see gaps in other demographics as well. I suggested we pull all of our data together before we jump to broader assumptions about what is going on with the 5-to-11-year-olds.” Just 0.59% of 5-11-year-olds have been double dosed, although vaccination appointments for children only became available in January. Some parents reported initially struggling to find an appointment, or that their appointment was cancelled due to supply issues. The recommended interval for most children is eight weeks. On Monday Royal Australian College of General Practitioners [RACGP] vice-president, Dr Bruce Willett, said there was a need for improved vaccine education for parents, citing a Flinders University study which found vaccine anxiety is driving parents to seek information from sources where misinformation is rife, including social media. “While we have high childhood vaccination rates in Australia, with 95% of five-year-olds having received all scheduled childhood immunisations, vaccine hesitancy remains a serious threat to our community,” Willett said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This is a concern because we know young children mixing at childcare and socially has been a key driver of [Covid-19] infections. “And while the research shows most children have only mild symptoms, they can spread the virus to family members who are more vulnerable and at-risk of severe symptoms, like grandparents.” But Leask said it is too simplistic to say the slow uptake is due to the spread of vaccine misinformation or even complacency, a word she dislikes because it implies parents are not prioritising their child’s health. “Parents may have other pressing issues they are juggling, poor access to vaccines may be an issue, and if you’re a working single parent with a large family it can also be tricky to get to a vaccine appointment.” A small vaccine sentiment survey, conducted for the federal government in January, found 76% of parents of 5-to-11-year-olds already had, or intended to, get their child vaccinated, while 15% were unsure, and 10% said they did not plan to get their child vaccinated. Leask said this indicated that many parents yet to get their 5-to-11-year-olds vaccinated perhaps just needed a reminder, or for vaccination to be made easier and more accessible. States and territories could consider placing vaccination hubs in primary schools in future to address accessibility issues, she said, as opposed to the more temporary pop-up hubs that are already being used. “We need to think about priorities and where we put our public health efforts,” Leask said. “It may be that some states want to focus on getting boosters to older people first. But there are other ways to increase rates in children, for example sending text message reminders to parents, and bringing vaccine services into communities.” Other parents may be waiting until their child recovered from Covid before vaccinating them, she said. “While the plateauing among 5-to-11-year-olds is concerning, and we need to do something about that, to put all of these possible barriers down to misinformation does not fully represent the challenges we face with any new vaccination program. Going from zero to 50% uptake in a short period with any new vaccine is actually quite an achievement.” Guardian Australia has contacted the office of the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, for comment.",News/Australia news,Expert panel to address Australia’s lagging Covid vaccination rates in children 5-11,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/expert-panel-to-address-australias-lagging-covid-vaccination-rates-in-children-5-11
2/21/2022,"A candidate endorsed by the United Australia Party told an anti-lockdown rally she wanted to say “hang Dan Andrews” but said she was “not allowed”, before continuing a chant of “jail Dan Andrews”, according to footage of the event. Clive Palmer’s party last week announced candidates for all 151 lower house seats, and attempted to boost their profile by publishing their names, photographs, and phone numbers in major Australian newspapers.  One of its candidates, Rebekah Spelman, helped MC last year’s anti-lockdown rallies in Melbourne. Footage of the 13 November rally, posted online by an “alternative” news outlet, shows Spelman leading the crowd in a chant of “jail Dan Andrews”. At one point she says: “Jail Dan Andrews! I want to say hang Dan Andrews, but I know that’s not allowed.” Spelman, a former councillor with Melbourne’s Frankston city council, is now running for the UAP in the seat of Aston, in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. Spelman referred all questions about her apparent “hang Dan Andrews” comments to the United Australia party. A spokesperson for the party did not respond to multiple emails, texts, and phone calls. The party has run a vast advertising campaign in an attempt to boost its profile and those of its lower house candidates. Guardian Australia has previously reported that the party spent $2.684m on 25 YouTube ads from late August, when former the Liberal MP Craig Kelly joined the UAP, until November, boosting the number of views on its videos into the millions. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age reported on Monday that the party had since spent $31m, citing figures from Nielsen Ad Intel for print, digital, metropolitan television, and radio. The amount is equal to the UAP’s total ad spend during the 2019 campaign. The advertising has prompted controversy on a number of fronts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Three out of every four UAP video ads on YouTube, which Spelman was not involved in, were pulled by Google for allegedly violating the tech giant’s advertising policies. Meanwhile its recent use of a picture of a different candidate in military uniform in advertising prompted anger from defence advocates, who said it went against longstanding conventions designed to guard against the politicisation of the Australian Defence Force. Some newspapers have also refused to publish UAP ads that they say are at odds with Covid health advice or official guidance on vaccines. Earlier this month Kelly signalled the UAP would put all sitting members of parliament last on its how-to-vote cards, which has prompted anxiety among government MPs. The Coalition benefited in the 2019 election from preference flows from the UAP. But Kelly, the former maverick Liberal and now UAP leader, says his party’s strategy could well change depending on where MPs line up in the final sitting weeks.",News/Australia news,"United Australia party candidate told rally she wanted to chant ‘hang Dan Andrews’, footage appears to show",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/united-australia-party-candidate-told-rally-she-wanted-to-chant-hang-dan-andrews-footage-appears-to-show
2/21/2022,"Before the weekend, Ben Garuccio had not scored a single A-League goal in four years. His drought dated back to before Riley McGree’s scorpion kick of 2018 was nominated for a Puskás award. On Sunday night the Western United full-back broke it in scarcely conceivable fashion, with a McGree 2.0 that has gone similarly viral.  The moment came when, midway through the second half of United’s 3-2 win over Western Sydney, Aleksandar Prijović caught the ball on the outside of his boot and chipped it into the box. It ended up just behind the onrushing Garuccio who, against the momentum of his run, threw his left boot up and over his body to flick the ball up and past Daniel Margush’s near post. ""I've seen it four times and I still don't believe it.""Come for the 🦂 goal. Stay for the commentary 😅A Sunday special from @Bengaruccio 👏pic.twitter.com/B3dFgyZfgc “It was unbelievable, to be honest,” said Garuccio, who scored two goals at Aami Park. “It was spur-of-the-moment. [Prijović] got it and I saw a little gap and I just ran and he played a top ball, and I just stuck my leg up basically and I thought, ‘if I can get any sort of connection on this it will be all right.’ “It actually hit my heel nice and flush and I was like, that’s a good connection, but I couldn’t see it and I looked up and it was in the net,” he said. “The rest is history, I suppose. “It just felt like I got a good connection on it because I did one in training a couple of weeks ago and I faceplanted horribly and everyone laughed at me.” United’s coach, John Aloisi, a former Australian international, was just as shocked. “I didn’t know if he did a bicycle kick or what until I saw it back on the screen,” Aloisi said. “I just couldn’t believe it. There’s some goal. He’s probably in line for a Puskás award – goal of the year around the world – so let’s hope he gets that.” hey everyone, I was just driving back from the game and just got home and have no idea what happened. Do suspect some foul play though so keen to find out what's going on too. https://t.co/H6jsYei32N A tweet of the video by @TheRealALM garnered 50,000 views within the hour and was retweeted internationally before, in a strange twist presumably to do with copyright, it was removed. The ALM’s official broadcaster, the Ten Network, subsequently posted its own video. Garuccio himself played down the prospect of a Puskás nomination, which would emulate McGree’s. McGree’s longer-range scorpion kick for Newcastle against Melbourne City got him a 2018 nod alongside Mohamed Salah and Gareth Bale, with the award ultimately won by Salah. “I don’t really think about that stuff too much,” Garuccio said. “Obviously, it’s a nice feeling. It’s an unbelievable goal. It’s probably the best I’ll ever score in my career. So of course I’ll enjoy it. “Riley McGree’s was unbelievable. It was right-footed as well. He’s a left-footer and he did it with his right foot and it was outside the box. I still enjoyed it, I’ll take it.”",Sport/Football,Ben Garuccio stuns A-League with ‘unbelievable’ scorpion kick goal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/21/ben-garuccio-stuns-a-league-with-unbelievable-scorpion-kick-goal
2/21/2022,"Nineteen journalists from Papua New Guinea’s leading television media company, EMTV, have been suspended following a walk-off protest by staff. The staff walked off the job last week in support of their head of news and current affairs, Sincha Dimara, who was suspended earlier in February for “insubordination” which according to reports consisted of running stories about the arrest of Australian businessman Jamie Pang including criticism of police and criminal procedure in the case.  The walk-off meant that last Thursday no news was produced by the station, which was forced to air a rerun of Wednesday’s 6pm news bulletin. The staffing dramas centre around the coverage of Pang, who was arrested in 2021 after illegal firearms and an alleged meth lab were found in the Sanctuary Hotel Resort and Spa in Port Moresby, where Pang was group operations manager. Pang pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the firearms charges but was not charged with any drug offences, with police saying that outdated drug laws in the country left them unable to pursue further prosecution. Papua New Guinea has no laws prohibiting the production, sale or use of methamphetamine. Pang is currently held at the detention centre in Bomana. On 5 February, a memo from the interim CEO of EMTV, Lesieli Vete, was sent to the EMTV newsroom regarding Pang stories. “You are hereby directed to drop all stories from EMTV on air and online on Jamie Pang, and any other related stories concerning Jamie Pang’s gym and sporting events. “I will be working with you closely today until further notice to review EMTV’s news stories so as to ensure that we are broadcasting stories in the best interest of the public,” said the memo, which has been seen by the Guardian. Dimara, who was head of news and current affairs at the time, told the Guardian she had been asked by Vete over email to explain why EMTV was reporting on Pang and his supporters. But Dimara said she stood by the decision to cover the story, particularly in light of recent parliamentary debates of drug laws. “Jamie Pang is an Australian citizen, a businessman and a sports personality. He was charged for been in possession of firearms and ammunition ... He is been detained at Bomana and we are aware that he will be deported. If or when it happens or not is still news.” Dimara said Pang was not awaiting trial – which can limit news coverage – and she saw no reason as to why stories related to him should not run. “We are not breaking any laws and I cannot see how we will be held in contempt.” Vete later issued a statement saying the leaked memo “was taken out of context”. “At no time were EMTV’s journalists restricted nor stopped from reporting unfolding stories on the detained resident,” the statement read. It said the memo was intended to get journalists to “drop stories sympathising with Pang”. “EMTV journalists have been cautioned to be sensitive when conducting interviews and to follow reporting guidelines. The memo did not in any way restrict the journalists’ freedom of press, rather the memo was circulated to staff with the view to properly scrutinise the content of news stories before they were aired that day.” Two days after the memo regarding coverage of Pang was sent to EMTV, Dimara was suspended. A press statement released on social media by EMTV staff stated they were “dismayed at the extreme harsh treatment of our head of news” and what they alleged was “the continuous interferences from outside”. “The news team strongly believes that the stories that ran on the nightly news relating to Jamie Pang were unbiased and reported with facts and did not impede on any of the current laws, nor did it implicate anyone,” said Jack Lapauve Jr, EMTV’s deputy head of news. On Friday, journalists from EMTV were barred from entering the newsroom in their Port Moresby, Mount Hagen and Lae offices. With concerns that EMTV management may attempt to replace suspended journalists with new recruits, Gregory Moses, vice-president of PNG’s media council, made a call out to all journalists in the country not to accept job offers from EMTV and to stand united with fellow journalists from EMTV. “Respect our colleagues who are currently affected by the decisions of the management and do not join the mass recruitment done by EMTVs management,” he said. Vete did not respond to requests for comment. This is the third time in the past five years that a news manager at EMTV has been suspended. Scott Waide was reinstated after being briefly suspended in 2018 over a story that was aired during the 2018 Apec Meeting, and in 2019 Neville Choi was terminated on grounds of alleged insubordination in a move that reportedly caused outrage in the EMTV newsroom which saw Choi also reinstated.”",News/World news,Nineteen journalists suspended from Papua New Guinea news station in coverage row,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/nineteen-journalists-suspended-from-papua-new-guinea-news-station-in-coverage-row
2/21/2022,"There were tears, DJs, Vegemite and drag queens as families, friends and lovers reunited at Sydney airport after the resumption of all international travel to Australia. While a number of expert bodies including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Council have warned against travel to Australia due to soaring Covid-19 case numbers over summer, the federal government has vowed to keep the borders open.  The federal minister for trade, tourism and industry, Dan Tehan, who was at the airport on Monday morning, said it was a “great day” for Australia’s tourism industry – battered by years of shutdowns. “It’s been a party out here at Sydney airport,” Tehan said, a bright blue T-shirt emboldened with the words “Welcome back” visible underneath his suit jacket. “To see the way people have been united – the hugs, the tears – has been wonderful. The future is looking very, very bright. “I’ll do everything possible to keep the border open.” At 6.20am, a Qantas flight from Los Angeles was the first to touch down at Sydney airport, marking the end of 704 days of restrictions on international travel. Fifty-six flights were expected to arrive in Australia on Monday, more than half of them landing in Sydney. The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, said there was a “buzz and excitement” in the air as the state rejoined the world. “It’s been a long journey, a long journey through Covid,” he said. “But having our borders open, not just here, but around our country will make a real difference in people’s lives; we’re seeing families being reunited … international students return. “Today we rejoined the world, and what a positive thing it is.” At the arrivals hall, travellers were greeted with koala and kangaroo toys, Vegemite and eucalyptus sprigs, while a DJ atop a bus played Australian hits such as Men at Work’s Down Under and Yothu Yindi’s Treaty. Friends and family clutched “welcome home” balloons and bouquets as the music played. Sam Brain arrived on Monday morning from London after two years apart from friends and family. Her school friend Emma was there to greet her with a tearful hug. Sam was planning to surprise her mother – who’d been fooled into thinking she was catching up with Emma for coffee – later that day. “It’s been an amazing experience coming back, quite overwhelming with everyone here”, she said. “And a DJ. The whole process getting here was so worrying … but I’ve made it. “My mum has no idea, she’s going to have a heart attack.” Rishm Singh arrived from Toronto in the early morning with her children and couldn’t wait to spend time with her family. “I was feeling a lot of anticipation – are we going to make it?” she said. “But we have, and I feel so grateful … the past two years were horrendous, heart-wrenching.” Sonnica was arriving from Spain to be with her Australian partner, Jay, after two-and-a-half years apart. The pair met in Spain while Jay was teaching English, and Sonnica said their relationship had survived with lots of phone calls. “We’ve kept in contact through WhatsApp – technology makes it easier,” she said. “But it’s been hard.” Yin and Chi Lam were eagerly awaiting the arrival of their daughter Michelle and her baby, due to touch down from New York after almost three years. The Sydney couple were yet to meet their granddaughter, born 13 months ago during the pandemic. “We’re so, so excited,” Yin said. “I feel very happy.” Beside them, drag queens adorned in bedazzled face masks, with sky-high heels and glittering Australian flag capes, greeted arrivals with cheers. “If you get handed Vegemite, don’t eat it by the spoon,” one told a slightly dazed-looking traveller.",News/Australia news,"‘Today we rejoined the world’: hugs, tears and Vegemite as Australia reopens international borders",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/today-we-rejoined-the-world-hugs-tears-and-vegemite-as-australia-reopens-international-borders
2/21/2022,"On a brisk winter day in February 1972, the 34-year-old American diplomat, Winston Lord, arrived in Beijing with his boss, Henry Kissinger, and president Richard Nixon. Barely an hour after they checked in to their guest house, a message came: “Chairman Mao wants to see president Nixon.” The urgency from Mao resonated with the excitement from the American delegation. The establishment of bilateral relations offered great opportunities for both sides in facing a common enemy: the Soviet Union. For more than two decades since the Chinese communists took over the mainland, Beijing and Washington had had no official contact on this scale.  Much to his surprise, Lord was asked to go along into the meeting with Mao as a note-taker. Secretary of state William Rogers not asked to attend and, so as not to upset Rogers, Nixon ordered Lord to be cropped out of the official photograph released to the press. “The meeting took place in Mao’s residence, in a medium-sized room filled with books and manuscripts, like a library,” Lord recalled in an interview with the Guardian. “The atmosphere was modest, compared to the enormity of the event. “Mao [also] bantered about how he and Chiang Kai-shek were enemies,” but Mao viewed it as essentially a “family quarrel”, Lord regaled, referring to the leader of the nationalists who fled to Taiwan after the defeat in the Chinese civil war in 1949. He continued: “[Mao] said, ‘We don’t have to solve difficult problems – he didn’t say Taiwan specifically, but that’s what he was referring to – immediately.’ So basically he was saying we can postpone the Taiwan issue while we get on with areas we agree on, for example balancing the Soviet Union.” The week-long visit concluded with the signing of the Shanghai communique. On 27 February 1972, the United States “acknowledged” that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China”. The US also reaffirmed “its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves”. The trip was hailed as much a diplomatic breakthrough as a TV spectacular. When he landed at Andrews air force base outside Washington after the week in China, Nixon received a hero’s welcome led by his vice-president, Spiro Agnew. Life Magazine’s Hugh Sidey recalled the murmur of a fellow journalist next to him at the airport: “My God, it’s like the arrival of the king.” Years later, the visit inspired an opera. Half a century on, this event has lost its sparkle in both capitals. In Washington, critics now question the wisdom of Nixon’s 1972 trip; many see China as an economic threat and – like Russia - a geopolitical enemy. In Beijing, there’s an increasingly louder view that the US is in its terminal decline and China’s system is ultimately superior. On 4 February, the leaders of China and Russia declared: “there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation’,” in a clear message to the US. This month, as both countries mark the anniversary, Washington has been embroiled in a mind game with Moscow over whether Vladimir Putin is to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Beijing, at the same time, was keen to remind Washington of what it sees as the biggest achievement of Nixon’s trip: the Shanghai communique and the status of the island of Taiwan. Speaking at a press conference on 10 February, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, emphasised to his audience the phrase of “one China” – which in Beijing is called a “principle” but in Washington a “policy” – and said the document was “the political foundation for the normalisation of China-US relations and the establishment of diplomatic ties”. In January, China’s ambassador to Washington, Qin Gang, warned that the Taiwan issue was “the biggest tinderbox” between the two countries. He made it explicit that the US and China could face a military conflict “[i]f the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence”. Officially, the US’s position on Taiwan remains one that reflects “strategic ambiguity”. It does not endorse Beijing’s claim to sovereignty over Taipei, nor does it regard the island as an independent country. Washington, however, is committed by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. Yet as the relations have soured, some – such as the Republican senator Ted Cruz – have suggested the US should make its commitment to Taiwan more explicit. The advocacy from Taipei is becoming more proactive, too. As the world watches the fate of Ukraine, Taiwan’s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, warned that Beijing “might be thinking about a military attack against Taiwan” after the Winter Olympics. “We are not asking for war … but we won’t bow to China,” he vowed. Some see the current state of play as inevitable and reflecting a structural issue between an incumbent power and a rising power. But Washington’s rethink of its China strategy began more than two decades ago when George Bush’s defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, presented him with a proposal to shift the US’s global strategic priorities towards Asia – and primarily China. “Many thought that once [Donald] Trump left the White House, tensions between the US and China would have decreased,” said Zeno Leoni of King’s College London and the author of American Grand Strategy from Obama to Trump. “However, the fallout at the Anchorage summit in Alaska, the endurance of trade sanctions, and a boycott of Olympic Games not seen since the cold war confirms that problems are structural.” Leoni saw a pattern in American grand strategy that encourages other countries, including former and potential rivals – Germany, Japan, China – to act as “locomotives” of a global economy that favours US interests. “However, this strategy has led to several ‘blowbacks’ in recent decades, including the rise of China,” he said. Lord insists Nixon’s approach to China half a century ago was “a brilliant strategic move”. “What was the alternative?” he asked. “If we didn’t open up to China, we certainly wouldn’t have had … the arms control agreement that we had within months with the Soviet Union. We would not have had either China’s or the Soviets’ help as much on ending the Vietnam war. We would not have restored American credibility at home and abroad. “The thing that China would never have emerged without our help is nonsense,” Lord continued. “Given the size of the Chinese population and the talents of the Chinese people, it clearly was going up sooner or later. When they began to emerge, what was the alternative? Trying to contain China? In addition to this being dangerous, it was impossible, because other countries wouldn’t join us. It would be ineffective.” But Leoni said whether Nixon’s China visit in 1972 was mistaken or not depended on whether we wanted to take the long view in history. “That meeting led to great global economic growth and to the end of the cold war. Yet it also was a selfish move that benefited the US, and the long-term implications of the rapprochement were not thought through enough at the time.” The stakes are high, and mismanagement of the US-China relationship is “arguably the biggest short-term threat to peace”, said Robert Daly of the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington. For more than 30 years, Daly has been observing the evolution of the bilateral relationship from both capitals. Daly said observers tend to think of Nixon’s visit only as a big geopolitical chess game, but more significantly, that week in February 50 years ago opened the “floodgate” for people-to-people exchange. “It gave the people of both countries permission to interact.” “Before 1972, the two countries saw each other only through the lens of security. After Nixon’s visit, they began to view one another in their full humanity,” Daly said. “Sadly, we are now reverting back to seeing each other solely through a security lens.” Lord, now 84, said he did not agree with the prevailing view in Washington these days that America’s engagement with China had failed. He said the two countries were in the middle of a long strategic competition. “But we are not going to be close friends – and I hope we won’t be outright enemies for many decades to come.”",News/World news," Fifty years on, ‘Nixon in China’ loses its sparkle in Beijing and Washington",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/fifty-years-on-nixon-in-china-loses-its-sparkle-in-beijing-and-washington
