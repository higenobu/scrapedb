2/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk gifted almost $6 billion worth of Tesla Inc. stock to charity late last year in one of the largest philanthropic donations in history. Most Read from Bloomberg Elon Musk Donated $5.7 Billion of Tesla Shares to Charity Putin Seeks Diplomatic Solution Amid ‘Partial’ Troop Pullback Putin Sees Basis for Talks After Scholz Meeting: Ukraine Update Trump's Accountants Just Quit. What Took So Long? Sarcasm in Ukraine Roils Markets Swinging Between War, Peace The world’s richest man donated more than 5 million shares in the electric-car maker from Nov. 19 to Nov. 29, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The gift was worth about $5.7 billion, based on average prices the days he sold the securities. The filing doesn’t name the charity and shows an unidentified trust was involved in the transaction. The donation occurred as Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, sparred with politicians including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over inequality and a proposed wealth tax. In the weeks leading up to the gift, Musk suggested he’d sell stock if the United Nations proved $6 billion would help solve world hunger, after the head of the organization’s World Food Programme called for billionaires like Musk to “step up.” A large gift to charity would help reduce what Musk has said would be the biggest tax bill in U.S. history. Days before he completed a series of stock sales worth more than $16 billion -- much of which was to cover the exercise of almost 23 million options -- the CEO tweeted he would pay more than $11 billion in taxes for the year. Much of Musk’s wealth is tied to Tesla, which overtook Toyota Motor Corp. as the world’s most valuable automaker in July 2020 and joined a select group of companies with trillion-dollar valuations in October. Tesla’s market capitalization has slipped since then to about $905 billion at Monday’s close. The shares advanced as much as 3.7% before the start of regular trading Tuesday. As his net worth has grown, Musk has bristled at criticism of billionaires and said he’d sell his homes and most of his possessions. With a $227.3 billion fortune, he’s more than $47 billion richer than the world’s second-wealthiest person, Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk has an eponymous foundation that’s become more active over recent years, with large, eight-figure gifts promised to the city near his South Texas spaceport, a $100 million competition for carbon removal and a $5 million contribution to two scientists researching Covid-19. Before then, his foundation’s largest contributions were to donor-advised funds, or DAFs, where charitable money can sit in perpetuity. The Musk Foundation, which used to count Musk’s brother Kimbal as a director, has recently added a new face to its roster. Several grant recipients Bloomberg News spoke with have said their primary point of contact at the foundation is Igor Kurganov, a professional poker player-turned-philanthropist who is active in the effective altruism space.

2/16/2022,"Net worth is a financial metric that can help you keep your individual picture of your finances in perspective. The average net worth by age, in this case, refers to the net worth of the households in the U.S. divided by the number of households. Metrics typically use households rather than individuals because a household can be one person or a large number of people. Net worth usually goes up with age as your income is higher, you own more assets and may have less debt. Here, we will break down net worth by age group for the entire population of the U.S. If you have more questions about net worth, you may want to speak with a financial advisor. SmartAsset’s free advisor matching tool can connect you with advisors that serve your area. What Is Net Worth and How to Calculate It Net worth is an excellent measure of how Americans are doing financially since it takes into consideration everything you both own, your assets, and owe, what you owe. Your assets, or what you own, include cash, bank accounts, investment accounts, the equity you have in your home and more. Valuable pieces of jewelry are included. So are any collections you have that have financial worth like stamps, coins or classic car collections. Your liabilities, or what you owe, include all your debt, including what you owe on your home, student loan debt, credit card debt and any loans you have outstanding. The difference between your assets and liabilities is your net worth. If you want to calculate your net worth, you add up the value of all you own and subtract from that the value of all you owe your creditors. The difference is your net worth. If we want to extrapolate that to the entire population of the U.S., we can add up the value of assets of every household and subtract from that the total amount those households owe their creditors. The result is the net worth of the total American population. Average Net Worth When you calculate the average net worth of the population of the U.S., the same procedure is used with one more step. You subtract total household debt from total household assets for the entire population. Then, since there is more than one household, divide by the total number of households and the result is the average household net worth for the U.S. population. It’s important to take into account income disparity between the rich and the poor when calculating the average net worth of the U.S. population. The Federal Reserve conducted its last Survey of Consumer Finance in 2019, the results of which were released in September 2020. In that survey, it found that if we just take an average of total net worth in the U.S., it is skewed upward since the top 10% of households hold 70% of the wealth and the top 50% of households hold 98% of the wealth. If you don’t adjust for this, the average net worth of an American household is about $748,800. One way to get a better read on the average net worth of Americans is by using the median net worth of the nation’s population. The median is the middle number of a list of numbers when they are sorted either in ascending or descending order. If you list all households’ net worth in the U.S., the median net worth is $121,700. You can see the income disparity by the large difference in the average net worth and the median net worth in the U.S. Average Net Worth by Age Net worth tends to go up as you get older. Several factors are responsible for the increase, like finishing your education, inheritances, your income, family structure, ethnicity and housing status. This list is not exhaustive. The 2019 Survey of Consumer Confidence conducted by the Federal Reserve breaks out net worth by age and gives the average net worth and the median net worth by age group. Early Adulthood If you are between the ages of 18-24, the average net worth is approximately $28,707 and the median net worth is approximately $8,216. Even in this age group, the average net worth by age is skewed toward the high end. If you are between ages 25-29, the average is $49,388 and the median is even further behind at $7,512. If you are between the ages of 30-34, the average net worth is $122,700 and the median net worth is $35,112. Between the ages of 35-39, the average is $274,112 and the median is $55,519. Middle Age Between the ages of 40-44, the average net worth is $623,694 and the median is $127,345. If you are 45-49, the average is $761,500 and the median is $164,197. In your fifties, if you are between 50-54, the average net worth is $897,663 and the median net worth is $171,360. Between 55-59, it is $1,165,477 and $193,549 respectively. Senior Between the ages of 60 and 64, the average net worth is $1,187,730 and the median is $228,833. If you are between 65-69, the average is $1,250,679 and the median is $271,805. In you are in your 70s, the average net worth starts to decline, but the median net worth does not necessarily follow. Between 70-74, the average is $1,173,653 and the median is $258,531. From ages 75-79, the average net worth is $945,480 and the median net worth is $272,976. From 80 years of age and forward, the average net worth is $973,141 and the median is $235,193. The Bottom Line From the average net worth, as compared to the median net worth, for each age group, it’s apparent that the median net worth may be a more standardizing financial metric to use to analyze net worth by age in the U.S. Since 50% of the population only owns 2% of the country’s net worth, it makes sense that to get a true picture of net worth by age in the U.S., you have to use a measure other than an average.

2/16/2022,"What can we say about 2022? The year is only 6 weeks old, and the markets – which climbed so high in 2021 – are in a correction. The NASDAQ has fallen almost 12% since the start of the year, and the S&P 500 is behind at a net year-to-date loss of 8%. The losses have been broad-based, although tech has been particularly hard hit. The headwinds pushing against the market momentum have come in a cluster. From the supply chain bottlenecks, to increasing shortages of goods, to steadily rising inflation, to the COVID pandemic that won’t go away and the vaccines that are seemingly ineffective, to the war drums beating on the Russia-Ukraine border, it seems there’s just nowhere to turn for a respite. Taking a cautious approach could prove to be a prudent solution; investors can seek shelter in a defensive play that will provide some income padding in the portfolio. Dividend stocks are a common choice; if the yield is high enough, it can offset losses elsewhere. Bearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks' database to zero-in on two stocks that are showing high dividend yields – on the order of 9% or more. Wall Street’s analysts say that these are solid stocks to buy. Let’s take a closer look. Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW) We’ll start in the mining sector, because what could be better than owning your own gold mine? Sibanye Stillwater has gold mining ops in its home country of South Africa – but has diversified widely around the world and is now one of the largest producers of the platinum group metals (PGMs), an important class of precious and rare metal elements. While Sibanye Stillwater is the world’s #3 gold producer, it is the #1 platinum producer and the #2 producer of palladium. The company is also heavily involved in recycling the industrial platinum used in automotive catalytic converters, and is moving toward the battery-metal recycling business as well. As by-products of the precious metal operations, Sibanye produces significant quantities of copper, lithium, nickel, and zinc This company reports its results every six months; the last such report, for 1H21, was released in August, and the next, for 2H21, is due out on March 3. Operating results, released in October, showed almost 644,400 ounces of PGM produced in the quarter ended September 30, 2021, along with over 293,000 ounces of gold. The PGM result was up from more than 612K ounces produced in the previous quarter, while the gold result was up from 269K ounces. The company reported just over US$1 billion in net earnings for the quarter. In recent weeks, Sibanye Stillwater has made two important announcement regarding its ongoing efforts at asset acquisition. In the first, from the end of January, the company announced that it had terminated plans to acquire nickel and copper mines in Brazil. The termination was due to discovery of a geotechnical event at the Santa Rita nickel mine. In the second announcement, made earlier this month, Sibanye Stillwater completed its purchase of the Sandouville nickel hydrometallurgical processing plant located in Normandy, France. The purchase, for 85 million Euros, further advances the mining company’s battery metal processing operations. As a policy, Sibanye Stillwater aims to return between 25% and 35% of earnings to shareholders. The company does this in part through a common share dividend, paid out twice yearly. The last dividend, paid out in September, was for 19 cents per US common share, or 77 cents per American Depositary Receipt. This ADR dividend, annualized to $1.54, gives a yield of 9.4%. Deutsche Bank analyst Abhinandan (Abhi) Agarwal takes a bullish stand on SBSW shares, writing, “We see several near- and long-term catalysts for Sibanye. In the near term, we forecast a rebound in PGM demand in 2022 as auto production cuts reverse (+10%YoY jump in 2022), which should drive PGM prices. The solid balance sheet and FCF generation positions Sibanye well to continue to return sector-leading cash to shareholders (we forecast cash returns at ~8% pa vs. peers at 3-4%)."" ""We remain structurally positive on battery metals (copper & lithium) and see the increasing EV penetration as a secular demand driver,"" the analyst added. Given all of the above, Agarwal has high hopes. Along with a Buy rating, he keeps a $18.50 price target on the stock. This target puts the upside potential at ~13%. (To watch Agarwal’s track record, click here) Overall, this stock gets a firm seal of approval from Wall Street, as shown by the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 positive reviews. The stock is selling for $16.38, and the average price target of $20.13 indicates room for ~23% upside in the year ahead. (See SBSW stock forecast on TipRanks) Sabra Healthcare REIT (SBRA) Now we’ll switch gears, and take a look at a real estate investment trust. It’s impossible to avoid these companies in a discussion of dividend stocks; REITs are well-known as reliable, high-yield dividend payers. Their dividend reputation stems from a requirement in tax regulations that they return a high percentage of earnings directly to shareholders. Sabra is a REIT involved in the healthcare industry. The company holds a portfolio of 421 properties, including leased and managed senior housing, skilled nursing and transitional care centers, and specialty hospitals. The company’s properties are leased to known profitable entities, and give Sabra a market cap of $2.92 billion. While Sabra has been generally successful in realizing solid revenues from its properties, the share price has been falling since last July. In that time, the stock is down 26%. The losses come even though the company has put up sound revenue numbers. The most recent, from 3Q21, came in at $128.5 million for the quarter and $433.8 million for the first 9 months of the year. We’ll see Q4 numbers later this month. In a key metric, the company’s normalized FFO (funds from operations) came in at $84.8 million for Q3. This was enough to maintain the dividend payment of 30 cents per common share paid out in November of last year. The next dividend, also for 30 cents per common share, has already been declared for payment at the end of this month. At an annualized rate of $1.20, the current dividend gives a yield of 9.3%. Sabra has held the dividend at its current rate for two the past two years. Looking under the hood of Sabra’s operations, Stifel’s 5-star analyst Stephen Manaker sees reason for optimism from investors. He writes, “We still assume SBRA is able to grow FFO this year. A large part of that growth will be from rent payments from a new operator running transitioned NY assets. We assume that operator starts paying in 1Q22. If we are close in that assumption (and others), our 2022 estimate implies 5.9% FFO growth. Given the stock is trading at 8.0x, we believe the valuations more than discount the operating challenges facing SBRA.” To this end, Manaker puts a Buy rating on SBRA shares, and his $21 target price implies a one-year upside potential of 64% (To watch Manaker’s track record, click here) Overall, this REIT holds a Moderate Buy rating from the Wall Street analyst consensus, based on 7 reviews breaking down 5 to 2 in favor of Buys over Holds. The stock is selling for $12.80 and its $17.14 average target suggests a 12-month upside of ~34%.

2/16/2022,"Vocal Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has once again predicted that the flagship digital asset could crash, this time with some technical indicators. According to Schiff, Bitcoin is on the verge of experiencing another fall, as it has formed a critical pattern known as “Double Top,” suggesting a strong bearish move. The “Double Top” indicator is a popular technical pattern marking the top of a bullish rally and is considered finished when a price falls below the “neckline.” Currently, the Bitcoin neckline stands at around $30,000. In the analysis of the crypto critic, if Bitcoin plummets below the $30k level, this could lead to the asset’s value dropping to as low as $10k or even lower. He posited that the asset has no support to stop it from falling below the level. While many Bitcoin enthusiasts will not want to believe or accept Schiff’s doomsday prediction, the gold proponent continued that Bitcoin might not only drop to around $10k, but we could also see the asset lose all of its value before the end of the year. However, Schiff’s predicted pattern has been found to be inaccurate, judging by the asset’s weekly chart. Another reason why this might not come into fruition is the recent price reversal that saw the price of Bitcoin move from $35k to around $45k during the recent weeks. Bitcoin’s reached its current all-time high of over $68k in November 2021. Since then, it has shed more than 25% of its value as the asset began the year poorly. As of press time, it is currently trading at $42,481. Available data from Glassnode has shown that the Bitcoin hashrate has surged to a new all-time high after it spiked by over 30% in a day. This means that the new ATH represents a 200% growth since China banned crypto mining activities within its jurisdiction.  As of press time, Bitcoin’s hash rate new ATH is at 248.11 million terahashes per second.

2/16/2022,"The 60s are probably the most common age that Americans retire during. Retiring at age 59 is a possibility, though, with some proper planning. For most people, once they’ve turned 59.5, they can begin withdrawing from their tax-advantaged retirement accounts without penalty. However, under certain circumstances, you can even withdraw penalty-free from these accounts at age 55 using the rule of 55. Preparing to retire by age 59 calls for evaluating the amount of income you can produce in retirement, estimating the expenses you expect to incur and how you can make up for any shortfalls. Consider working with a financial advisor as you create or modify your retirement plans. How to Retire at 59: Projecting Your Income Potential Start your earlier retirement planning effort by projecting how much income you can generate in retirement. By beginning here, you’ll have an idea of what kinds of decisions you can make regarding your retirement. For instance, let’s say you have family in New Jersey that you’d like to retire near. New Jersey is a notoriously high-cost state, so it would be helpful to understand your income before you choose to move there. Here are the major sources of income you might use in retirement: Social Security benefits: You cannot claim these benefits before age 62, so you’ll need other sources of income for the interim. Tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts: IRAs, 401(k)s and other retirement accounts can be tapped without a 10% IRS penalty after age 59.5. However, you may also qualify for penalty-free withdrawals at age 55 if you leave your job during or after the year you turn 55. It also doesn’t matter whether you were fired, laid off or quit. Pensions: Pensions are less common than they once were, but some workers still receive them. Depending on the pension plan’s rules, you may be able to start receiving benefits by age 59. Savings accounts and CDs: You can use these to fund your retirement without any tax restrictions. They’re also some of the most reliable, low-growth investments you can make. Taxable investments: Stocks, bonds, ETFs and other securities can be sold to earn you capital gains. These are taxed much more favorably if they qualify as “long term” gains. Home equity: Home equity loans and reverse mortgages allow retirees to tap the value in their homes to generate income to cover retirement expenses. Wages from part-time employment: Working limited hours at a job you enjoy can be a pleasant way to boost your income and emotions during retirement. Inheritances: Each year, about $350 billion is transferred from one generation to the next, according to the Federal Reserve. If you anticipate an inheritance, the assets could be used to produce retirement income. Annuities and cash-value life insurance: These insurance-based tools can provide guaranteed income for a set number of years, or as long as you live. Rental income: If you own real estate, the income you receive from rent can also help with your retirement expenses. How to Retire at 59: Budgeting Your Expenses After assessing your income-producing potential, estimate your post-retirement expenses. This is where many of your retirement decisions will be made, as it should be quite obvious what areas and types of homes you’ll be able to afford when accounting for these costs. Here are some common expenses retirees face: Housing: Rent, mortgage, utilities, insurance, homeowner’s association fees, repairs and maintenance are all potentially part of post-retirement housing costs. Healthcare: The older you get, the more you’ll typically spend on healthcare. Taxes: Some states are more tax-friendly than others, in terms of income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes. The key is to try and balance where you can afford to live with where your heart is. Food: Groceries are unavoidable costs, while dining out is an optional expense. Transportation: The costs of car ownership or using public transit are hard to avoid, and traveling by air or other means for recreation can be a significant optional cost. Miscellaneous: The small necessary costs of running a household along with options like cable TV, streaming subscriptions, magazines, newspapers and theater tickets could all be part of this. Other costs: If you have children who need help with college, or you want to contribute to charity, these expenses need to be added to your retirement budget. Rather than preparing a detailed budget, you can take a percentage of your pre-retirement income and use that as a rough-and-ready estimation of post-retirement spending. Many advisors recommend using 60% to 80% of your income before retirement as a guide to how much you’ll spend after leaving the workforce. How to Retire at 59: Major Considerations Retiring at age 59 isn’t like retiring at other ages. Particularly because of Social Security, it’s often more challenging than retiring at 62 or older. Of course, each person’s own situation is unique to what feels like a near-impossibility to one can seem like a breeze to another. Here are some major factors to consider: Social Security: You can’t claim Social Security benefits before age 62 unless you qualify as “disabled.” The average monthly benefit in 2022 is $1,657 and the maximum is $4,194. The biggest benefits go to high earners who delay claiming benefits until age 70. Whether you claim early or late, you’ll need to come up with the money some other way for at least the first three years, until you reach 62. This Social Security benefits calculator can help you decide when to claim. Medicare: This will cover your healthcare costs once you reach age 65. Before then, you’ll need to find insurance in the private sector. You may be able to pay to keep coverage for a limited time under your previous employer’s plan. After that, options include paying for one of the plans offered under the Affordable Care Act. Retirement account withdrawals: After 59.5, you can withdraw from tax-advantaged retirement plans without penalty. Again, if you quit, are laid off or are fired from your job during the year you turn 55 or later, you can make penalty-free withdrawals. Life expectancy: One of the most important factors in retirement planning is how long you expect to live after retiring. You can use Social Security’s basic life expectancy calculator to get an idea. How to Retire at 59: Ways to Increase Your Income & Reduce Your Expenses If your income and expense figures aren’t matching up, you’ll need to either increase income or reduce expenses to fill the gap. Here are ways to do that. Generate Income Save more. The bigger your retirement nest egg, the more income it can produce. To take advantage of compound interest, start saving earlier. Max out tax-advantaged retirement plans, especially those that feature an employer match. Then start a taxable investment program. Take more chances. Adopting a more aggressive investment strategy potentially can increase the size of your assets at retirement as well as their ability to generate income. Work part-time. Many retirees choose to work part-time to generate more income. Reduce Expenses Where you retire can affect your ability to retire. The cost of living in Mississippi, for instance, is half the cost of living in Hawaii. Pay off debt. If you pay off your mortgage, you can probably retire sooner because housing costs are a major expense for everyone, including retirees. The same goes, to a lesser extent, for auto, student and other loans. Bottom Line Retiring at age 59 is (sometimes) possible if you plan and prepare for it. Start by knowing how much income you can generate after leaving work. Then prepare a post-retirement budget. Fill any shortfalls by saving more, changing your investment style or considering part-time work. Check out how people who want to retire earlier than 59 are going about it.
