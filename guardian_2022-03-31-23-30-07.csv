3/31/2022,"After a statement revealed that Bruce Willis would be “stepping away” from acting after an aphasia diagnosis, a Los Angeles Times report has revealed that concerns over his cognitive state have been circulating for years. Speaking to directors and other crew members who have worked with the 67-year-old actor, the article details Willis struggling to remember dialogue, expressing confusion at his surroundings, needing shortened work days and having issues with gun use. “After the first day of working with Bruce, I could see it first-hand and I realized that there was a bigger issue at stake here and why I had been asked to shorten his lines,” said Mike Burns, director of 2021 thriller Out of Death. During the shoot, he was required to compress 25 pages of dialogue into one day of filming. Burns was then asked to direct another film and after expressing concerns, an associate told him Willis was in much better shape but soon found out, after production, that this wasn’t the case. “I didn’t think he was better; I thought he was worse,” Burns said. “After we finished, I said: ‘I’m done. I’m not going to do any other Bruce Willis movies.’ I am relieved that he is taking time off.” On the set of 2020’s Hard Kill, Willis allegedly fired a gun with a blank on the wrong cue twice in a row, according to Lala Kent, his co-star and Vanderpump Rules star. No one was injured and while a producer claimed to the LA Times that this didn’t happen, other crew members insist that it did. On the set of the upcoming thriller White Elephant, crew members recall that at one moment Willis said: “I know why you’re here, and I know why you’re here, but why am I here?” Terri Martin, the film’s production supervisor added: “He just looked so lost, and he would say, ‘I’ll do my best.’ He always tried his best. He is one of the all-time greats, and I have the utmost admiration and respect for his body of work, but it was time for him to retire.” Director Jesse V Johnson said he didn’t feel “comfortable” working with Willis again. It was also reported that his management insisted that shoots were limited to just two days, often getting paid $2m a film, and that he would work no longer than eight hours each day although production sources allege that it was closer to four. His lines would often get fed to him through an “earwig”, industry speak for an earpiece. In the last three years, Willis has made 21 movies. Recently, the Razzies, the annual awards given to the worst films of the year, created a category called worst performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 movie. The statement, released yesterday, referred to it as a “really challenging time” for his family. “We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him,” it read. The major causes of aphasia, characterised by difficulty with language or speech, are head trauma or a stroke. It affects about 2 million people in the US.",Arts/Film,‘He just looked lost’: worries over Bruce Willis’s cognitive state surface,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/31/bruce-willis-cognitive-state-report-aphasia-diagnosis
3/31/2022,"The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to 14 more people and organisations principally involved with information and media, including a prominent TV anchor and the group which controls the RT television channel. The new measures, unveiled by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is aimed at countering what Truss called the “torrent of lies” from Russian media about the invasion of Ukraine. Another individual targeted in this set of sanctions is Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev, the senior officer in charge of the siege of Mariupol, the southern Ukrainian city which has been bombarded relentlessly by Russian forces at enormous civilian cost. Mizintsev, who heads the Russian national defence management centre, is accused of using similar tactics previously in bombing Syrian cities. Among those targeted is Sergey Brilev, a presenter on the Russian state-run Rossiya channel. The Foreign Office notice said Brilev previously lived in the UK, but would no longer be able to visit or to access any UK assets. Also targeted is TV-Novosti, which controls RT, the Russian TV station whose licence to broadcast in the UK was revoked recently by the UK regulator, Ofcom. Another media group is named – Rossiya Segodnya – which controls the state-run news agency Sputnik. Other individuals named include: Aleksandr Zharov, the chief executive of Gazprom-Media and former head of Roskomnadzor, Russia’s federal service for the supervision of communications, information technology and mass media; Alexey Nikolov, the managing director of RT; and Anton Anisimov, the editor-in-chief of Sputnik. “We want to continue to further ratchet up the pressure on Putin and his regime,” Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson said. “We know that countries can adapt to sanctions over time, so it’s right that we keep moving forwards on this. “It’s equally right to place sanctions on those who are seeking to misinform people on a mass scale, and that is what these sanctions are targeted at.” In a statement, Truss said: “Putin’s war on Ukraine is based on a torrent of lies. Britain has helped lead the world in exposing Kremlin disinformation, and this latest batch of sanctions hits the shameless propagandists who push out Putin’s fake news and narratives.” The UK has so far targeted more than 1,000 individuals and entities for sanctions, including a number of businesses and dozens of oligarchs.",News/World news,UK sanctions target Russian general and media heavyweights,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/uk-sanctions-target-russian-general-and-media-heavyweights
3/31/2022,"Peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv will resume on Friday, a senior Ukrainian negotiator has said, amid mounting western scepticism about Russia’s true intentions five weeks into its invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said on Thursday that talks would continue by video, focusing on a written framework for peace the Ukrainian side presented during a face-to-face meeting in Istanbul this week that Russian officials described as constructive. Russia’s foreign ministry said that Moscow would not refuse a separate meeting between the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, providing the talks between them were “substantive”. Kyiv and its allies have expressed doubts, however, about Russia’s commitment to the talks, noting that there had been little or no sign of a partial military pullback Moscow promised as a goodwill gesture and suggesting the Kremlin may be merely playing for time to allow its forces to regroup. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said Turkey aimed to bring Lavrov and Kuleba together for further talks. “There could be a higher-level meeting, at least at the level of foreign ministers, within a week or two weeks,” he said. “What matters is that the two sides come together and agree on a lasting ceasefire,” Çavuşoğlu said, adding that “significant progress” had been made – even if some may have been “tactical manoeuvring” and nothing much had changed on the ground. Arakhamia praised the role of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in the peace talks, saying he had initially acted as an “unofficial back channel of communication” and was now trying to act more as a neutral mediator between the two sides. Çavuşoğlu also said the former Chelsea football club owner was “playing a useful role”, while the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Abramovich plainly had Putin’s trust and was “sincerely trying” to end the conflict. However, the Kremlin has already rejected some elements of Ukraine’s peace proposals and Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said on Thursday that Putin had told him in a telephone conversation that “conditions were not yet mature” for a ceasefire. “In Putin’s opinion, there have been some small steps ahead in the negotiations,” Draghi said. “We all want to see a ray of light ... There is a desire to move forward soon, but it is also too soon to overcome scepticism.” Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, has insisted the Kremlin was considering Kyiv’s proposals, which include an international treaty under which the country would remain neutral with its security guaranteed by third countries. The proposals, which are intended to come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, also include a 15-year consultation period on the status of the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine and annexed in 2014. Podolyak said a draft agreement could be signed in the next few days, paving the way for a meeting between the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Putin. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, has also suggested progress looked possible. In speeches to the Dutch and Australian parliaments, meanwhile, Zelenskiy on Thursday asked for more weapons, reconstruction aid and a complete halt to business with Russia, warning that failure to halt Moscow’s aggression would encourage others to follow suit. “Stronger sanctions are needed so that Russia doesn’t have a chance to pursue this war further in Europe,” the Ukrainian president Dutch MPs via a video link. “Stop all trade with Russia.” Energy imports from Russia must be halted “so that you do not pay billions for the war”, he added. Referring to the international war crimes courts in the Hague, Zelenskiy also called for justice. “Those who gave the orders to bombard and shell Ukraine must be called to account. In the Hague, city of tribunals, people know that,” he said. To Australia’s parliament, Zelenskiy said Russia must be held accountable. “If we don’t stop Russia now, if we don’t hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world … will decide that such things are possible for them as well,” he said. The Ukrainian leader repeated his call for tougher sanctions, accusing Moscow of “nuclear blackmailing” to limit the global response to the invasion, which has seen Russia cut out of much of international trade through unprecedented sanctions. The European development bank (EBRD) said on Thursday it expected the Russian economy to contract by 10% this year and Ukraine’s by 20%, calling the war between the two countries “the greatest supply shock” for 50 years.

3/31/2022,"The company running the national tutoring programme (NTP) has been axed and funding will go directly to schools instead after the government was forced into a climbdown over its flagship scheme which will now be overhauled. Labour accused the government of wasting millions of pounds of public money, and said the NTP revamp announced on Thursday was “too little, too late, for too many children”. The NTP is regarded by ministers as the jewel in the crown of the government’s £5bn post-pandemic education recovery programme. However it has been the target of widespread criticism after Randstad, the company providing it, had multiple problems with delivery and scandalously low participation rates in some areas. Following months of negotiations with stakeholders, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, promised a new “simplified” structure to allow extra tuition to reach as many pupils in England as possible. In a significant U-turn, all of the £349m of tutoring funding for the 2022-23 academic year will now go directly to schools so they can arrange their own provision – something headteachers have been calling for from the outset. Under its current £32m contract, the giant outsourcing multinational Randstad plays a central role in the delivery of the NTP, linking schools with approved tuition providers via a platform which has been fraught with problems. It has a “one year, plus one year, plus one year” agreement with the government, which will now be severed at the end of the first year. Under the new arrangement, schools will be given the freedom to decide how best to provide tutoring for their children, which could include one-on-one or small group tutoring through teachers or teaching assistants, or continuing to work with external tutoring specialists and academic mentors. The Department for Education (DfE) will launch a procurement process in April for a new supplier for a much smaller contract, which will focus on quality assurance, recruiting and deploying academic mentors and offering training to support schools to make best use of their funding. Randstad could decide to bid for the new contract. The move, first revealed by Schools Week, was well received in the sector. “This is a welcome reset of the NTP and kudos to Zahawi for listening,” said one relieved NTP delivery partner. On funding going directly to schools, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “We have argued since the outset of the programme that this is what should happen.” Zahawi told Schools Week he did not think it had been a mistake to appoint Randstad. “You launch something, you scale it, and then you begin to circle back and say, right, how can I refine it? And that’s what we’re doing.” Labour, however, was damning. “The Conservatives’ flagship tutoring programme has failed our children and wasted millions of pounds of public money,” said the shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson.“The education secretary is finally catching-up but this is too little, too late, for too many children.” The announcement came as new figures confirmed low participation rates, with just 14% of schools in England accessing tutoring via the Randstad programme this academic year, compared with 53% of schools who arranged tuition themselves through a new school-led tuition route introduced last year. Overall, less than 60% of schools have participated in the NTP since September. Announcing the overhaul, Zahawi said the NTP had transformed the way schools provide support for pupils who need it most, with 1.2m courses now started across the country since the programme began. “It’s teachers and schools that know their pupils best, which is why we are building on the success of school-led tutoring so far – with evidence as our watchword – so that as many children and young people as possible can feel the huge benefits high quality tutoring provides.” Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons’ education committee, welcomed the move. He said: “Randstad’s delivery of the national tutoring programme has been particularly alarming.” Randstad’s NTP director, Karen Guthrie, said: “We have been lobbying the DfE and ministers for some time to simplify the rules around accessing the programme and standardise the funding and we are pleased that our advice is being implemented for next year. “We remain committed to the programme’s principles and its delivery and still have an important job to do for the remainder of this year. Randstad will look to continue its relationship with the DfE if we believe it is in the best interest of the programme and all those benefiting from it.” ",News/Education,Government axes outsourcing firm for England tutoring scheme ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/31/tutoring-funding-to-go-directly-to-schools-in-england-after-government-u-turn
3/31/2022,"Which bits of Because the Night were written by you, and which were by Bruce Springsteen? palfrey-man Jimmy Iovine was producing [1978 album] Easter and had given me this tape. Bruce had already put the song together and “Because the night belongs to lovers” was the chorus, but he had no verses. At the time, my boyfriend Fred “Sonic” Smith [of the MC5], who I later married, lived in Detroit and I lived in New York. Long distance calls were expensive and we weren’t rich, so we’d set a time and speak once a week. One night, Fred didn’t call. I was restlessly pacing about and I remembered this tape Jimmy wanted me to listen to. I thought: “Darn, this is a hit song.” But it was very relatable. Fred finally called at midnight, by which time I had finished all the verses and the reprise/coda. That’s why it says: “Have I doubt when I’m alone / love is a ring, the telephone.” It’s a love song to Fred. I couldn’t talk to him, so I talked to him through the song. Bruce later wrote his own lyrics but always praised my version and the last time we sang it together, he sang my words instead of his, which was very nice of him. Your 1975 masterpiece Horses features one of the most iconic album covers ever. Did you anticipate its cultural impact – and what is your favourite album cover? VerulamiumParkRanger I wanted Robert [Mapplethorpe] to do the album cover because he wasn’t known and I wanted people to see his work. But no, I had no idea that it would have such impact. How I was dressed was how I always dressed. Robert took 12 pictures and I think it was the eighth and he just said: “This is the one with the magic.” I wish he could have lived to see the impact it made, but boys like Michael Stipe or Bono and many, many girls have talked about Robert’s photograph and that makes me really happy. [Bob Dylan’s] Highway 61 Revisited is one of my favourite albums and I love the cover photo with the camera behind him. Then Blonde on Blonde came out in the gatefold sleeve and, oh my gosh, it was so great. I return to Horses endlessly because of its lethal combination of drama, poetry, danger, love, sex and rock’n’roll. What’s your favourite of your albums? poopoo I like the longer improvised pieces such as Radio Baghdad, Memento Mori or Radio Ethiopia, but as a whole album I like the last one, [2012’s] Banga. Constantine’s Dream, the long improvised piece at the end, touched a lot of things that concern me – art, the future of mankind, climate change, the horrors done to our indigenous people, and love. I love the cover, which was shot on the fly by my friend Stephen Sebring. That record feels like me, like Horses feels like me. It’s been too long since Banga. Are there any plans for a new album? Punkawallah I do have plans and I’ve written a lot of songs. I’d like to do one more album and my record company, Columbia, has very generously left the door open. What’s it like to play/make music with your children? BlueHorseFilms My son [Jackson, 39] never got to hear Fred, his father, play, but he has identical guitar tones. My daughter [Jesse Paris, 34] is more of a composer, and even though piano was Fred’s second or third instrument, she has the same touch. So in playing with them, I feel not only close to them, but close to him. They’re both better musicians than I am and sometimes I’ll hit a wrong note and see the audience laughing because the two of them are making little faces at each other. They have a great sense of humour and we’ve grown together onstage. Do you have any unrealised dreams? If so, what are they and what do you intend to do about them? Huw_Morgan There’s nothing I love more than books. I’ve written some and I’m really happy with them but I just want to write at least one that I feel deserves to be in the canon of books to endure. I basically want to write something as good as Pinocchio and, yes, I’ve started it. Could you please share a memory of Vali Myers? Piramiddo When I was a young girl, I found pictures of her in a book called Love on the Left Bank. She was one of the early beautiful gypsy beatnik girls. Living in rural south Jersey, I aspired to look like that or be free like that, to go from Parisian cafe to cafe, writing poetry. I was living in the Chelsea Hotel with [actor/playwright] Sam Shepard and one day Vali Myers walked in with a baby fox on her shoulder, which matched her wild red hair. I was amazed. Vali had tattoos all over her face, so I asked her if she would give me a tattoo of a small lightning bolt on my knee in honour of Crazy Horse, which she did with a big sewing needle in ink. To this day, it’s on the inside of my left knee, so I think of her every time I look at it. How do you cope with some of the harder realities of life such as war, bad leaders or illness? How do you maintain hope? joverexcited I feel terrible for young people because, in all my years, these seem like the worst of times, in terms of war looming, the pressures of social media and the environmental crisis, which is frightening. My main personal challenge in life has been illness. I was always a sickly kid, but I got through tuberculosis, scarlet fever, measles, chickenpox and an earlier pandemic. Then I had to go through losing childhood friends, my brother, my husband and my fellow musicians. I’ve found that as people we have the power to endure a lot of things and also to make things better. I don’t have any answers, but I look to the young, someone like Greta Thunberg or my daughter, who is a climate change activist. Every human being has responsibility to make things better, every action gets reaction and even in the smallest of ways we can all do something useful. What brings you joy? VKK1989 One of my favourite lines in music is from Jimi Hendrix’s 1983… (A Merman I Should Turn To Be). “Hurrah. I awake from yesterday.” I live by that. Another day, I’m still here. A chance to do something useful, read a book, see a film, see my kids. I just saw The Power of the Dog – such a great movie – and The Batman. I just made myself peanut butter toast and black coffee, one of my father’s favourite things, and I suddenly had such a sense of him. I experience joy very easily. How did you end up working with Terrence Malick on Song to Song? HaveOneOnMe3 Terrence Malick screen tested me for Days of Heaven in ’75 or ’76. He really liked me, but I was fairly unknown and he couldn’t secure the part for me, but he remembered me. Forty-five years or so later I was doing a concert in Austin, Texas, where he lives, and he asked if I would improvise with his actors. Michael Fassbender and Rooney Mara were there and he just asked me to improvise in certain scenes. I actually never saw it, so I don’t know how I did. I love the Jerry Week essay. Did you know all those dates or did a ton of research go into that piece? karlrgibson I’m not good at remembering faces but I’m very good with dates. The Jerry Week essay starts on 1 August, Jerry [Garcia]’s birthday, and ends on the 9th, the day he passed. 2 August was William Burroughs’ passing. My son was born on 5 August and Hiroshima was bombed on the 6th. These are things I just remember. My next project is a book partly inspired by 365 days on my Instagram, called The Book of Days. I’m convinced that there are certain days when things happen. I met Fred on 9 March 1976 and on 9 March 1989 Robert passed away. It’s also the birthday of many people I admire – Ornette Coleman, John Cale, Bobby Sands, Bobby Fischer … and 4 November is Robert’s birthday and the day my husband passed away. It’s uncanny, especially if you’re me living through it, but it helps put things into perspective. Life has great joys and great sorrows and we have to take the whole package. Could you talk about your collaborations with Blue Öyster Cult? Bellewitch My first public performance was a poetry reading in the bookstore where I was working in February ’71. Sandy Pearlman was there and he managed Blue Öyster Cult, who were just forming and still called the Stalk-Forest Group. He was very excited about my performance and he asked if I’d like to audition to be the lead singer. I said: “I don’t know anything about fronting a rock’n’roll band. I’m a poet.” But I met them and wrote several songs that they recorded, such as Career of Evil. The keyboard player, Allen Lanier, became my boyfriend and played on Horses. Sandy Pearlman produced the Clash, who I’d seen when we were performing Horses. I called Walter Yetnikoff at CBS and he sent Sandy to London to see them. They got signed, but they would have done anyway, because anyone who saw them would know that this band was important to the future of music. Is it true that you and Philip Glass kept Allen Ginsberg company as he was dying of cancer? Viennesewaltzer I was very close with Allen. In his last days, he was in his loft in the East Village, listening to Big Mama Thornton, then he went into his last sleep. There were monks on the floor chanting, his Jewish relatives, young poets and people that loved him. Philip Glass and I kept alternate vigils along with Robert Frank, Larry Rivers and Gregory Corso. Peter Orlovsky never left his side. At the end it was myself, Peter, the poet Oliver Ray and a couple of young acolytes. I can’t say it was sad. It was more like an honour to sit by the side of a great friend but also one of our greatest poets. My song Don’t Say Nothing is about my thoughts as Allen died. When I first met him in my 20s he thought I was a very pretty boy, because I was in a long grey overcoat and a cap. We always laughed about that. You have often spoken and written at length about your lifelong love for Arthur Rimbaud, notably in your memoir Just Kids. Didn’t you buy a derelict farmhouse in the Ardennes that once belonged to his family, with a view to turn it into an artists’ residence? auroreborealis During the first world war, the Germans bombed the Rimbaud compound, so his sister had another house built on the same spot using the debris. A very old woman lived in this house until she was in her 80s; it was in disrepair and she couldn’t take care of it. This is the land that belonged to his mother, where he laid in the grass and looked up at the stars, where he wrestled with [his poem] A Season in Hell and where he suffered when he lost his leg at the end of his life. This old woman found me, and I can’t just go and buy houses, but it was at such a reasonable amount that I bought it to be the guardian of the land for the future. I’ve repaired it to turn it into a writer’s residence for one person. That was delayed by the pandemic, but it will happen. Your Soundwalk Collective collaborations are a thing of wonder. Are there any more planned? DJSteve Funnily enough, during the pandemic we did six major pieces, all original, around 14 minutes long. One is dedicated to the children who got pancreatic cancer after the accident at Chernobyl, another to the underwater drilling that is killing our whales. I’m quite excited about it. In retrospect, do you feel you should have gone harder towards the written word and that music was a diversion, or is artistic expression one big ball of fun? Haigin88 I would never call artistic expression a big ball of fun. Whoever said that it is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration was exactly right. It’s work. When I go on tour, I call them jobs, but also it’s a sacred struggle. I’m not a very social person, so the heart of my sociability is in performing. When I left public life from ’80 to ’96, I didn’t do one live performance, but along with raising my children I was completely immersed in writing and studying. I was able to write Just Kids because of 16 years of intense practice – writing, rewriting and really honing my craft. How long before you semi-retired from music in 1980 did you know that you were going to stop, and was it scary to stop and then return? Haigin88 In 1979, I wasn’t huge in America but in Europe the last job I did was in an Italian arena for 80,000 people. I was at the pinnacle of real success and financial success, but I wasn’t growing as an artist or human being. Not due to drugs or anything – that wasn’t part of my lifestyle – but attitude. A lot of hubris. I was a really demanding asshole sometimes and I wasn’t writing as much. Plus, I had a bronchial condition so playing in smoky halls was physically debilitating, and I was away from the person I loved. I’d only ever intended to do one record and hopefully create space for other people, which I felt Horses did. So withdrawing felt liberating. Coming back was very different. After the deaths of my husband and brother, I was alone in Michigan. I had two young children. I had financial difficulties. I had to go back to work and it was scary, wondering if people would remember me. I returned owing to a set of terrible circumstances, but I met Michael Stipe, who was like my guardian angel. Bob Dylan gave me my first tour. Allen Ginsberg was there, William Burroughs, Jeff Buckley … So I wasn’t alone. I had evolved, but there was still part of me that might put her foot through an amplifier or tear the strings off a guitar. What is your definition of punk rock? alexHD Freedom.

3/31/2022,"Hello, and Happy Thursday, In the fall of 2017, I was sitting in the cramped press area at the supreme court as a lawyer named Paul Smith urged the justices to strike down the districts for the Wisconsin state assembly. They were so distorted in favor of Republicans, he argued, that they violated the US constitution. As Smith started to lay out his case, Chief Justice John Roberts cut in and laid out what he feared would happen if the supreme court were to step in and start policing electoral maps based on partisanship. “We will have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win. So it’s going to be a problem here across the board. And if you’re the intelligent man on the street and the court issues a decision, and let’s say the Democrats win, and that person will say: ‘Well, why did the Democrats win?” Roberts said. “It must be because the supreme court preferred the Democrats over the Republicans. And that’s going to come out one case after another as these cases are brought in every state. And that is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country.” The supreme court eventually upheld the Wisconsin districts on technical grounds. But in 2019, the court removed itself and the entire federal judiciary from policing partisan gerrymandering. “Partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts,” Roberts wrote. He pointed to state courts as one potential forum where litigants could bring claims. Together, those two moments underscore how wary Roberts was of getting the court entangled in redistricting cases, highly politically charged disputes that could pose a serious threat to the court’s apolitical reputation. That’s why it was so stunning to see the supreme court intervene last week over Wisconsin’s new legislative maps. Instead of staying out of a redistricting dispute, the supreme court went out of its way to insert itself into the center of a dispute in one of America’s most politically competitive state. The Wisconsin case that arrived at the supreme court this year was a bit different from the one it considered in 2017. This time around, the state’s Republican legislature was challenging the state legislative districts that the Wisconsin supreme court picked for the state. Even though Republicans would still hold their majority under the new map, lawmakers took issue with the creation of an additional Black-majority district near Milwaukee. They said there wasn’t adequate justification for creating it, and made an emergency request to the supreme court to block the maps. In a seven-page unsigned opinion, the supreme court accepted that request last week. But it went further, using the case as an opportunity to interpret the Voting Rights Act in a narrow way without full briefing or oral argument in the case. Even longtime court observers were baffled. It’s no secret that the supreme court has been extremely hostile to voting rights recently. But what has changed is the “velocity,” that the court is acting with, Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, told me. “The supermajority of the conservative justices on the supreme court has become pretty emboldened. They’ve got a narrow vision of the scope of the Voting Rights Act. And they are not being shy about enforcing that as quickly as they can,” he told me. “What’s changed is how much more aggressive they’re willing to be.” That increased aggressiveness may in part be a function of the supreme court’s increased conservative majority. Back in 2017, when the court heard the first Wisconsin case, Anthony Kennedy was the swing justice on a court divided 5-4 between liberals and conservatives. Now, Kennedy is gone and conservatives have increased their majority to 6-3. Experts aren’t just alarmed by what the supreme court has been saying about voting rights, but also the way they’ve been going about it. The court had embraced an idea recently, called the Purcell principle, that courts should not upset the status quo when an election is near. But the justices have been inconsistent in how exactly it has applied that rule has not really said how close an election must be before courts can’t intervene. In early February, for example, justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito said it was too close to Alabama’s 24 May primary to impose a new congressional map that would have increased Black representation. But in early March, when Kavanaugh made the same argument for upholding North Carolina’s congressional districts ahead of its 17 May primary, Alito, joined by Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, said it was not too close. And in the Wisconsin case, state election officials said any ruling that came after 15 March would “increase the risk of errors” as it prepared for its primary election in August. The supreme court intervened nine days after that deadline. “It is a sign that many of the breaks have come off,” Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas told me. “It’s a sign that the court is increasingly willing to do whatever the court wants to do, procedural constraints and sort of awkward timing nonwithstanding.” Also worth watching… Anyone who isn’t in jail or prison for a felony can vote, a three-judge panel in North Carolina ruled on Monday. The decision could affect up to 56,000 people in the state, though election officials aren’t letting people with felonies register just yet.

3/31/2022,"One of this year’s more significant musical anniversaries is the bicentenary of the birth of César Franck. Born in what became the independent country of Belgium, Franck was one of the most influential figures in French music in the second half of the 19th century. Nowadays, outside Belgium and France, even his best known orchestral works, the Symphony in D minor and the Symphonic Variations for piano and orchestra, crop up in concerts far less often than they once did, though his organ works at least are still regularly performed. There are parts of his output that remain practically unknown. Later this year, Bru Zane is planning to record Hulda, the grandest of Franck’s four operas, none of which was staged in his lifetime. But the label’s first release marking the bicentenary is a survey of his 22 songs and six vocal duets. Spanning his entire career as a composer, they are settings of a wide range of verse, from what the wonderfully comprehensive essay in the sleeve notes describes as “a poem verging on silliness written by a provincial crank” to texts by celebrated authors such as Sully Prudhomme, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. There may be no great songs here to rival the masterpieces of Duparc, Fauré and Debussy, but all of them are elegant and refined. With a single exception, the solo numbers are performed by Tassis Christoyannis, whose flexible baritone wraps itself tactfully around each vocal line. The odd one out is one of the two settings that Franck made 10 years apart of Hugo’s S’il est un Charmant Gazon; that is sung by Véronique Gens, who also joins Christoyannis in carefully shaded performances of the set of six duets. Altogether it’s a quietly enjoyable collection. Franck’s Complete Orchestral Works are brought together on a four-disc set from Fuga Libera; a second volume, containing all the chamber music, is due from the same label later this month. With performances by the orchestra from Franck’s birthplace, the Philharmonique Royal de Liège, under a variety of conductors including François-Xavier Roth and Gergely Madaras, the mixture of reissued and brand new recordings includes not only the Symphony, the Symphonic Variations (with Florian Noack as the soloist) and the five symphonic poems, but several early works for piano and orchestra, the ballet music from Hulda and an orchestration by his pupil Gabriel Pierné of Franck’s best known piano work, the Prelude, Choral and Fugue. The performances are always decent but, rarities apart, more engaging and insightful recordings of most of the works here can be found elsewhere.",Arts/Music,Franck: Complete Songs and Duets review – elegant and refined vocal works,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/31/franck-complete-songs-and-duets-review-tassis-christoyannis-veronique-gens-jeff-cohen
3/31/2022,"‘Do I overreach?”, asks Jacqueline Novak. Well, yes – no show ever overreached more, which is what makes Get on Your Knees such a remarkable comedy. The show, which arrives trailing all kinds of glory from Off-Broadway, is about the blowjob. It’s a philosophy of the blowjob, a spoof academic treatise on the blowjob, a personal history of blowjobs – and a full spate of ridiculous metaphors for the penis soft and hard and every which way to orally arouse it. In the long line of comedies borne of overthinking things not usually taken seriously, few ever over-thought to this spectacular effect. There’s not much you don’t get in Get on Your Knees, a 90-minute show notable for its verbal profusion as well as its eye-catching subject matter. You get Novak the playful and skilful standup, mainlining that brand of intellectual superiority and brittle self-regard also practised by her podcast co-host Kate Berlant. (“As a woman of ideas, everything from the chin down feels beneath me.”) You get a handful of free-standing routines, about boyfriends’ dads or – and this one’s brilliant – the relationship between the confident and self-deprecating halves of Novak’s personality. But the meat of Get on Your Knees is Novak’s blowjob material; it’s the most phallic standup set since Richard Herring’s Talking Cock. The first half essentially trolls the penis, ruthlessly dismantling the macho language (“penetrate”; “rock-hard”) and mythologies around the act of fellatio. The penis, argues Novak, is feminine and floral – unlike the surprisingly masculine (Stoic, self-contained) female orgasm. Good luck resisting the intellectual bravado and rhetorical force of this first 45 minutes, upon which Novak then builds the tale of her own tentative then cocksure journey through oral sex. That second section is a mite more conventional, and its narrative twists aren’t wholly unexpected. Probably it’s 10 minutes too long – even while acknowledging that the show’s point is in giving us a lot to swallow. But Novak’s overreaching – the rendering of her smutty stories in high-blown literary and metaphysical terms (“The Greeks were right: we can’t escape our fates … ”); the endless arresting analogies – never stops being audaciously funny.

3/31/2022,"Hundreds of egg producers are facing collapse as rising costs of fuel and energy combine with additional costs of keeping hens indoors during a bird flu outbreak. British free-range poultry farmers are calling on big retailers to increase the price of a dozen eggs by 40p as some smaller producers are already on the brink of shutting down. Andrew Jorêt, the chair of the British Egg Industry Council, including caged birds, said: “The tidal wave of cost increases will see many family farms, some of which have been producing eggs for generations, going under in a matter of days, unless something is done quickly.” He said the availability of British eggs on supermarket shelves was “seriously under threat” if rising costs for farms could not be passed on. These include a 50% increase in the cost of feed and a 40% rise in energy costs. The national flock, including caged birds, has already declined by about 4m birds in the past year. Farmers say the war in Ukraine has added to their difficulties. This is because the rising price of feed – which largely consists of grain such as wheat, a big proportion of which is produced in the Black Sea region – has added costs of up to 30p to a dozen eggs. Dan Brown, a free-range egg producer who has 44,000 hens in Suffolk, has been farming for 18 years but said he would be “in serious trouble” if the situation did not change in the next six months. “Our feed costs are up 40%, energy is up 60%, and to bring in the next flock of hens is going to cost 10% more,” he said. “Add in a labour increase of 10% and we are probably losing about 2 to 2.5 pence on every egg laid on the farm. “We will be in serious trouble if the market hasn’t turned by the autumn, but it needs to turn immediately,” he said. Producers of normally free-range eggs are facing particular difficulties as they are being forced to keep birds inside because of a severe outbreak of avian flu. The British Free Range Egg Producers Association (BFREPA) said the change required more staff to take care of the birds, energy to light and heat the barns in which the animals are kept. Toys including footballs and old CDs on strings are also needed to keep entertained birds that are used to being able to roam outside. Robert Gooch, the chief executive of the BFREPA, said farmers were becoming increasingly desperate as their appeals for higher prices had not been responded to by the big retailers including Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Tesco, Waitrose, Lidl, Aldi and Marks & Spencer. “This is not a false flag – the free-range egg sector is in crisis and if something doesn’t change these farms will close and the people who run them will not have an income. This is a situation entirely out of farmers’ hands. The whole world can see that feed and energy prices have gone through the roof – that has consequences,” he said. The issues have emerged as a whole range of British producers struggle with rising costs, including fertiliser, as global shortages linked to the pandemic are worsened by Brexit and the war in Ukraine. The National Farmers’ Union has warned of a huge drop in UK-grown crops, including peppers, cucumbers and aubergines, as it becomes too expensive to produce them. The NFU said producers of crops who used greenhouses were facing a reduction of up to 50% in the amount they could afford to grow because of the huge increase in the cost of the gas needed for heating. Minette Batters, the NFU president, said the number of cucumbers grown this year could fall from 80m to 35m, while for peppers it could halve to 50m. The cost of rearing a chicken has also increased by 50% in a year. Vast greenhouses are empty in the UK as growers hold off from planting because prices will not cover costs. While it cost about 25p to produce a cucumber in Britain in 2021, it has doubled this year and is set to hit 70p, the trade body British Growers told Reuters. However, regular-sized cucumbers were selling for as little as 43p in UK supermarkets this week.",News/Environment,Egg farmers: UK supermarkets must raise price or we’ll go under,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/cost-of-farming-crisis-egg-producers-plea-to-uk-supermarkets-to-raise-price
3/31/2022,"Upon its release, Top Gun was a sensation. The highest-grossing film of the year, it sold 47m cinema tickets in America alone – enough to keep it playing on more than a thousand screens nationwide for five straight months – and shattered home media records. The film was instantly iconic, both for its aerial sequences and for the parts that Pauline Kael called “a shiny homoerotic commercial”. If you ever want to watch the precise moment where Tom Cruise became Tom Cruise, you watch Top Gun. But that was 36 years ago, and much has changed since then. Tony Scott, the movie’s director, died a decade ago. Tom Cruise became a megastar, lost it all in a bout of silliness then clawed his way back to the top. Top Gun as an entity has plummeted in relevance, too; overtaken by decades of bigger and flashier movies. And yet here we are. In a few short weeks, Top Gun: Maverick will finally hit our screens. It’s been a long time coming; first derailed by Scott’s death and then, multiple times, by Covid. But now its release looks immovable, so only one question remains. Does anyone actually care? You have to be honest, it doesn’t exactly look this way. A Top Gun sequel looks destined to struggle to find a place within a release schedule studded with superhero movies and other ongoing franchises. The original isn’t well remembered enough to make a dent with the kids, and the people who did love it can’t see any justification for a new one. It would be a gamble at any time but, post-Covid when not even Steven Spielberg remaking a beloved musical can get bums on seats, it seems hellishly risky. The thing that has me really worried, though, is the newest Top Gun: Maverick trailer. See the moment where Miles Teller reveals that he’s actually Goose’s son? See the moment where everything cuts away to a photo of Val Kilmer on the wall? Doesn’t it feel like the film is busting an absolute gut to tie itself to the original? Honestly, who wants to see that? My theory is that, if Top Gun: Maverick is a flop, it’s because it doesn’t realise the true strength of Tom Cruise. At this point in his life, Tom Cruise transcends plot. It doesn’t matter what film you put him in, he’s Tom Cruise. This is the reason why, a few years ago, someone on Wikipedia changed the name of most characters he had ever played to “Jack” and it took a while for people to actually notice. And if Tom Cruise can transcend plot, then he definitely transcends this sort of needless fan service. People aren’t going to watch Top Gun: Maverick to see how it ties into the broader Top Gun universe. They’re going to watch it because it’s a Tom Cruise film. At this point I have to hop off the fence for a moment. I’m going to watch Top Gun: Maverick. This is because, in part, it offers the precise thing that I want from a Tom Cruise movie in 2022, which is Tom Cruise being flung around all over the place like a rag doll. This, after all, is the real reason why anyone is invested in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The plots of those films are hammy and labyrinthine, but they’re redeemed by Cruise’s total, planet-destroying dedication to pushing himself to the limits of human endurance. Tom Cruise sees a building, Tom Cruise wants to climb up the side of it. Tom Cruise sees a helicopter, Tom Cruise pilots the damn helicopter himself. Tom Cruise sees a plane, Tom Cruise dangles off the side of it by his fingertips. And this spirit of reckless adventure looks set to continue in Top Gun: Maverick. The most compelling scenes shown in any of the trailers so far are the ones where Cruise gets whipped around in a succession of blazingly fast jet fighters. In fact, I’d argue that the few people who are excited about Top Gun: Maverick don’t actually want there to be a plot at all. They’d just be happy with two hours of Go-Pro footage of Tom Cruise smooshed into the back of his seat, getting his face mangled beyond all recognition by G-force. Tom, if you’re reading, there’s still time to edit out everything that isn’t this.

3/31/2022,"The UK’s oil and gas regulator has withdrawn a demand that the fracking firm Cuadrilla plug and abandon two wells in Lancashire, amid concerns about the UK’s energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Weeks after Boris Johnson appeared to waver over the government’s moratorium on fracking, imposed in 2019, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) issued a ruling that indicates the door to the controversial technology could be reopened. A Westminster official dismissed as “nonsense” Labour’s claim that the decision had been taken due to pressure from the government. The NTSA had ordered Cuadrilla to permanently shut its wells at Preston New Road and Elswick by the end of June. But, after the exploration company applied on 28 March to have the decision reversed, the NSTA ruled that it could delay plugging the wells for a year. “Cuadrilla now have until the end of June next year to evaluate options for the Preston New Road and Elswick sites,” the authority said. “If no credible re-use plans are in place by then, the North Sea Transition Authority expects to reimpose decommissioning requirements.” The statement indicates that Cuadrilla could use the extra year to draw up proposals on how to mitigate concerns, such as noise and water pollution, or small tremors that have been linked to the fracking process. A complete U-turn by the government on its opposition to fracking might allow the company to proceed with its original plans. Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) has previously been unequivocal about his opposition to fracking, and has said the production of shale gas would not help reduce UK gas prices. The wholesale price of gas has *quadrupled* in UK and Europe. Additional UK production won’t materially affect the wholesale market price. This includes fracking – UK producers won’t sell shale gas to UK consumers below the market price. They’re not charities. (4/9) Only 17% of the public support the technology, which has almost no support from MPs in areas with potentially exploitable gas reserves. But despite widespread opposition, the drive to improve the UK’s energy security after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia – the world’s second largest supplier of oil and gas – has triggered calls to reopen the debate about fracking, particularly on the right of the Conservative party. A group of backbench Conservative MPs, including members of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, have lobbied for the government to change its stance. Kwarteng said earlier this month that he was keeping an “open mind”, an apparent thawing of his position that came as a No 10 spokesperson said the prime minister wanted to “look at all our options”. While the NSTA is an independent regulator, it is in regular contact with the BEIS, its parent department. The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “This is an appalling decision by the regulator, made after pressure from government. This has nothing to do with the energy needs of the country and everything to do with the Conservatives bowing to their backbenchers. “The government itself concluded that fracking is unsafe, and will not help our energy security or cut bills. And fracking is strongly opposed by local communities. “It is a sign once again that this government cannot be trusted to make decisions in our national interest on energy security, bills, or the climate crisis.” A Whitehall source dismissed as “nonsense” the idea that ministers had leaned on the NSTA to make its decision, and said the moratorium on fracking remained in place until there was compelling scientific evidence to show it was safe. Cuadrilla’s chief executive, Francis Egan, said: “I am delighted that the regulator has taken the sensible decision not to abandon the UK’s only two viable shale gas wells at this time of soaring gas prices. “It is widely acknowledged that natural gas will continue to play a key role in UK energy supply for many decades to come, even as the country transitions to a net zero CO2 economy. “We remain convinced that the Bowland shale gas resource has the potential to be a very significant contributor to UK energy supply and in particular a source of cost-effective fuel for heating UK homes and businesses.” He said the government should end the moratorium on shale gas.",News/Environment,Cuadrilla allowed to delay closure of Lancashire fracking wells,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/cuadrilla-allowed-to-delay-closure-of-lancashire-fracking-wells

Managers including Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp have been strongly in favour of the move but three times in the past two years the idea was rejected. “From next season, clubs will be permitted to use five substitutions, to be made on three occasions during a match, with an additional opportunity at half-time,” the league said in a statement. “A total of nine substitutes can be named on the team sheet.” At least 14 of the 20 clubs needed to vote in favour of the proposal and the decision moves England’s top flight in line with the Europe’s other major leagues. The Premier League also said the summer transfer window would open on 10 June and close at 11pm on 1 September and that its Covid measures had been updated. “From 4 April, the league will remove twice-weekly Covid-19 testing of players and staff and move to symptomatic testing only,” it said.

3/31/2022,"Sustainability has never been higher on the national agenda as government and business respond to the increasing awareness of the need for urgent change. For companies developing technologies that can address the climate emergency, this is a time of opportunity at home and abroad. As well as bringing increased trade and revenues, products and services that lower environmental impact could create tens of thousands of jobs in the UK and transform the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. With the international green sector growing rapidly, the UK Government has launched its Clean Growth programme to help boost demand for British innovation and technology, and help exporters tap into the market. Specialist advice was a timesaver for BuffaloGrid’s Daniel Becerra One innovative company that has its eyes firmly set on an international future is Belfast-based BuffaloGrid, which uses solar power to bring phone and internet connectivity to communities without access to electricity. Daniel Becerra co-founded the business to help close the digital divide in developing countries. “Half the planet’s population does not have access to the internet, but it’s not like they’re all living in rural places with no coverage,” says Becerra, who is originally from Mexico. “The problem is access, affordability, digital skills and relevant content. What we want to achieve is to provide digital prosperity for the underserved and the unconnected.” BuffaloGrid’s solar-powered hubs charge phones and power banks, supply wifi, and enable content streaming His team has developed a solar-powered hub that can serve up to 1,000 people. It can charge phones and power banks (these are provided free by BuffaloGrid), supply wifi and bring digital content to communities. The hubs are distributed mainly through partnerships with mobile network operators and convenience kiosks, as well as refugee camps run by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. The first 400 will go to India, Bangladesh and Nigeria, connecting up to 200,000 people. “One device can have a big impact in the community,” says Becerra. “Next year, we’re planning to produce 4,000 units, to take us to 2 million users. We’re concentrating on areas with the highest population density, where we can have the biggest impact.” BuffaloGrid is not Becerra’s first business. In 2008, he co-founded Artica Technologies, which developed intelligent systems for the energy-efficient cooling of buildings in the UK. Three years later, with an exit under his belt, he started looking for his next problem to solve. “I’ve fallen in love with the impact tech startups can have,” he says. “And I’ve always believed connectivity is one of the best tools to level the field between the haves and have nots.” The UN sees improved connectivity as key to ending poverty, halting climate change, and fighting inequality across the world. “We need to be out there, we need to reach these markets,” says Becerra about exporting his products to the places where they are needed the most. To this end, BuffaloGrid has been supported by Innovate UK, the Carbon Trust and the Department for International Trade (DIT), whose advice on the certifications, legislation and taxes for each country proved invaluable. “That was work we tried to do ourselves in India. It took six months and we failed. With DIT’s help, we were able to do it in two weeks,” says Becerra. His advice to other SMEs would be to take advantage of expertise wherever it’s available. “Whether that’s your local authority, DIT, or a company that has more experience than you, get advice. Decisions that you make nine months before your delivery date can have a massive impact. You will not know all that you need to know before you get started. The more you can learn, the better.” Tapping into support can be the catalyst that turns a good idea into a world-changing one. Dr Amrit Chandan and Carlton Cummins launched Aceleron Energy in 2016 after inventing the world’s first fully serviceable and recyclable lithium-ion battery, with the aim of finding a solution to the growing issue of battery waste. “A battery is made up of lots of components but usually it’s impossible to access them, swap them out or repair them,” says Chandan. In contrast, Aceleron’s battery can be stripped into its core components in five minutes. There’s a smart management system and it’s possible to swap out individual cells to maximise the lifetime of every element. To help it explore markets for its products, Birmingham-based Aceleron received support from the Transforming Energy Access programme, which is administered by the Carbon Trust, as well as attending trade missions and the Consumer Electronics Show, a showcase for new technology held annually in Las Vegas, with DIT. “It’s difficult to just go into a market and say: ‘We’re here, buy our product,’” says Chandan. “Without the support we received, we wouldn’t be here today.” Aceleron’s battery design allows individual components to be replaced, extending battery life and reducing waste Exporting now makes up half of the company’s business, with batteries sent to the Caribbean, India and Kenya, and ongoing programmes of work in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and others. With the number of electric vehicles on the roads rising, researchers estimate that some 250,000 tonnes of battery waste will accumulate worldwide over the next 15-20 years, so the opportunity is there for Aceleron’s batteries to have a real impact in reducing that waste. “We saw this challenge as being larger than the UK, right from day one,” says Chandan. “We have a great sense of pride that our products aren’t just generating profit for us in the UK, but are positively impacting people and the environment.” The idea of protecting the planet also inspired Rachel Watkyn to develop her own sustainable packaging after she struggled to find the right kind for her jewellery business. Realising her vision has taken grit and persistence. When she appeared on Dragons’ Den in 2008 to pitch her idea, some of the Dragons were sceptical, saying she was on an eco-warrior crusade. “They told me I’d only ever be a niche,” says Watkyn. Even so, two of them saw potential and backed her to the tune of £60,000. “I may have been ahead of the curve but I believed things would change.” Now, Watkyn’s Tiny Box Company turns over £10m a year and sells to 42 countries. Tiny Box Company founder Rachel Watkyn sees potential for growth in overseas markets Watkyn was inspired to start Tiny Box because of the lack of sustainable packaging options for the small jewellery business she was then running. “I couldn’t really put ethical jewellery into plastic, mass produced boxes from China,” she says. “But when I approached UK manufacturers, they said I needed a minimum order run of 1,000 units per size – it would be a 12-week lead time, and I’d need to pay lots of tooling charges for each size. So I decided to do it myself.” Her product resonated with SMEs in the UK and abroad, though Watkyn says she did not initially have an export strategy. “I set up the business because I had a problem. It had never really occurred to me to look at international markets. But we started to realise we were getting orders from France.” Making small tweaks, such as adding an international phone number and local currency functionality, made the website more friendly to overseas customers. In previous years, exporting has made up around 10% of the East Sussex-based company’s overall sales, although this decreased because of the pandemic and challenges around Brexit. However, the situation is starting to improve and Watkyn has plans to increase her investment in international markets. “We’ve realised there isn’t a lot [of competition] out in Europe, so we could be doing a lot more there.” As well as signing up to the global marketplace Fruugo, she’s been working with DIT to evaluate the possibility of opening a factory in the Netherlands, and is about to move into a new 50,000 sq ft warehouse in the UK. “That will mean we can really start driving forward [with international sales],” she says. Watkyn firmly believes that exporting can be a driver for business growth. “We took a hit last year, but now it’s all systems go,” she says.

3/31/2022,"If you’re a small business owner, the world is your oyster. But if you want to make the most of the opportunities out there, the know-how of an expert on exporting can make all the difference. International trade advisers (ITAs) partner with businesses to help them explore opportunities for selling goods and services internationally. There may be a wealth of information and support available for SMEs, but these dedicated advisers bring an extra level of knowledge, and have the expertise and experience to offer tailored support to individual companies. Estelle Dingley has been an ITA for eight years and works in the Department for International Trade’s (DIT) consumer team, specialising in digital strategy and e-commerce. Based in Brighton, Dingley previously set up and grew an export department for an educational products manufacturer. “Very often SMEs need an impartial person as a sounding board – because we’re not part of the business, we see it differently, and can bounce questions off each other,” says Dingley. Stephen Noblett, another experienced ITA, was recruited by DIT from industry 10 years ago. A food and drink sector specialist based in Yorkshire and the Humber, he uses his knowledge of having run his own speciality meats business to help advise clients. “A large percentage of advisers have worked for businesses on the export side, then become advisers because of our knowledge,” says Noblett. “Wherever you are in England, there’s an adviser to help you.” We asked Noblett and Dingley to share some of the key questions they hear from businesses time and again – and how they respond: Q: Is it worth looking into exporting?Even if you’re comfortable with your business’s success in the UK, you could grow your business exponentially through exporting. “Companies are selling to 68 million people in the UK – but there are billions more people worldwide,” says Noblett. “Small orders build up into repeat orders, then somebody else sees your product overseas, and before you know it, things have snowballed. I’ve seen SMEs gain £400,000 of extra sales through exports.” Dingley adds: “It’s very common for service-based SMEs to think they need a physical product to export. I worked with a PR agency that thought they couldn’t export, so I brought in a market research consultant to work out exactly what they should be offering abroad, and we developed a clear path for them to follow. A year later, the US now makes up 25% of their revenue, which has doubled overall – so don’t ever assume you can’t export.” Q: Is my product ready to export?You might be expecting your bestselling product to fly off the shelves in foreign markets, but an ITA can help you navigate potential pitfalls before you take the plunge. “You might have to change your product, or look at some new packaging, but these things aren’t insurmountable,” says Noblett. “For example, if you’re exporting sweets into the Middle East, is your product completely free of gelatine and alcohol? What labelling regulations do you need to know about? And what health certificates are needed? These are the things we educate people about, and by working closely with embassies around the world, we ensure businesses know exactly what they’ve got to do before they export.” Q: How can I ensure my product sells?Exporting isn’t as simple as taking your existing product and sending it out into the world: it has to fit the market you’re pursuing. Before proceeding, find out where your competitors are based, how they’re pricing themselves, and where you fit into the market. “I once had a product that was a bestseller in the UK that simply wouldn’t sell in Denmark,” says Dingley. “When I spoke to the distributor, he told me it was too cheap – customers assumed it wasn’t a quality product. So we repriced it accordingly, and it became a bestseller there too. “Also, make sure you’re not competing with yourself. You could be selling via a distributor or retailer, then pricing differently online, but if you end up undercutting your distributor, you’re indirectly competing with yourself.” And remember to price your product after factoring in costs such as import duties, customs and shipping – not before. Q: Do I need to protect my trademark?“Companies don’t always realise the importance of protecting their trademark,” says Dingley. “One client found a distributor, and against my advice failed to register his trademark. Two weeks later he called in a panic, saying: ‘The distributor’s trying to register our trademark, how do we stop it?’ And that’s not very easy once the process has started.” Noblett adds: “If someone else registers your product in another country, you’re facing years of getting your branding back. You might even end up with your product having its reputation destroyed.” Q: What countries should I be targeting?Wherever you feel your product fits, the key is to take things slowly – country by country or even region by region – rather than trying to export everywhere at once. “You wouldn’t export to Europe, you’d export to France or Germany, and in the US you should be concentrating one state at a time,” says Dingley. “Find out where the demand is coming from, and do your market research.” Attending trade shows can also help you identify the markets that are the best fit for your brand. Noblett says: “We proactively put SMEs in front of people who want to look at the export market. One company came to us with the idea of exporting gluten-free flour, and we helped them to identify that there’s a huge market for their product in the Middle East and in Nordic countries.

3/31/2022,"Bruno Fernandes has agreed a new contract with Manchester United that will make him one of the three highest-paid players at the club. Paperwork to extend the midfielder’s deal to 2027 is ready and an announcement will follow. Talks started in July and a breakthrough was made two weeks ago. Fernandes joined from Sporting in January 2020 on a five-and-a-half-year contract, with an option to extend for a further year, so the new proposal adds only one extra season but substantially increases his salary in recognition of his impact. Although the 27-year-old’s form has dipped this season he is regarded by United as a central part of their future regardless of who takes over from Ralf Rangnick as manager this summer. Fernandes scored both Portugal goals on Tuesday as they beat North Macedonia to qualify for the World Cup. United announced on Thursday that they would play in Bangkok and Melbourne in July on a tour during which they will face Liverpool in Thailand and Crystal Palace and Melbourne Victory in Australia.",Sport/Football,Bruno Fernandes among Manchester United’s top three earners in new deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/31/bruno-fernandes-manchester-united-new-contract-among-top-three-earners
3/31/2022,"Germans are being urged to brace themselves for the possibility of a slow down or complete halt of natural gas delivered from Russia after the government triggered an emergency plan to manage its supplies. Robert Habeck, the economics minister, has pleaded with both private households and industry to be sparing with their usage, telling them: “We are now in a situation where every kilowatt hour of energy that can be saved, is helpful.” The first part of a three-point emergency plan that decides how and where supplies would be directed in case of the flow of gas and oil being under threat was activated on Wednesday. Hospitals and emergency services would be prioritised, followed by private households. Industries – which use a quarter of the gas delivered to Germany – would be the first expected to shut down. Businesses are being urged to make individual cases for how much energy they would require in case supplies have to be rationed, according to the plan, which was drawn up in 2017. The effect on industry would be a stark and immediate negative impact on the economy, including on supply chains and employment. The head of the association of German towns and cities, Helmut Dedy, on Thursday urged the government to “get serious” about tackling the challenges. He suggested the introduction of a speed limit on autobahns, of 10 km an hour, earning the backing of the environmentalist lobby group, BUND, which said it would also advocate the introduction of car-free Sundays and an end to short-haul flights. Dedy said a halt in the flow of Russian gas or oil was now a realistic scenario and measures must be taken immediately not least to prepare people for the situation. “We don’t want any hysteria, but we do need a stronger awareness by people and in the economy that we may be heading for a crisis of considerable scale,” he told the news agency DPA. A speed limit on German roads had been proposed for environmental reasons during the negotiations ahead of the formation of the current government, but had been rejected after opposition from the pro-business FDP. Dedy said that Habeck’s triggering of the emergency plan was correct. “We need to be taking all possible measures at our disposal and on every level in order to prepare us for a supply stop from Russia, for both strategic and practical reasons,” he said. Gas price soared again on Wednesday on news that Vladimir Putin was insisting that gas and oil supplies would have to be paid for in future in roubles. In a telephone conversation with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, Putin agreeing that payments could continue in euros or dollars. However, Berlin is under no illusion that the situation might quickly change. The vulnerability of Europe’s largest economy has already been greatly exposed due to the fact that 55% of its gas imports – higher than other European countries – come from Russia. The government has repeatedly come under pressure by Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to stop buying Russian gas. The Lithuanian president said it was time for Europe to stop all energy trade with Russia. “The income from it simply serves to finance the attack on Ukraine,” said Gitanas Nausėda at a joint press conference with the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, in Vilnius. Germans were first urged to “turn down the thermostat” shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, anecdotally at least, increasing numbers of Germans appear to be doing just that. Orders for heat pumps as an alternative to gas central heating are reportedly at a record high and people are also heeding warnings over the necessity of saving energy, including by not keeping electronic equipment on standby mode, or by switching to LED lights. As businesses are called on to show where they can reduce their energy consumption, some are even urging their employees to switch to laptops rather than use desktop computers, or are turning off showroom lights at night. Berlin has said it plans to wean Germany off Russian gas, but Habeck has cautioned this will not be possible before the middle of 2024. He has not ruled out putting a temporary halt on a plan to close down coal burning plants, something which would have been considered unthinkable even just a few weeks ago for the Green politician.

3/31/2022,"Equalities campaigners are dismayed that only eight women are standing for election to Western Isles council, despite a campaign to diversify Scotland’s only all-male local authority. Council officials and equalities activists had urged more women to stand for Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Gaelic for Western Isles council, after none of the seven female candidates who stood in 2017 were elected, leaving the authority run solely by men. After nominations to stand in May’s Scottish council elections closed on Thursday, it emerged just eight women had come forward – fewer than had been hoped. They are competing with 42 male candidates for 29 seats on Comhairle nan Eilean Siar in the election on 5 May – two fewer places than in 2007, after wards were reorganised. Historically, Western Isles has regularly returned the lowest number of women councillors in Scotland: the most was five in 2007. While one woman was elected as provost, the equivalent to mayor, in the 1960s, none has served as a committee convenor. Hannah Stevens, the chief executive of Elect Her, an equalities group that ran an election workshop for women in the Western Isles in January, said the latest figures confirmed that significant work was needed to address the imbalance. “We are disappointed but not surprised to see little progress since 2017,” she said. “To see an increase in representation inside our council chambers we need to transform and modernise the culture of local government across Britain. “Dismantling male-dominated political spaces is long-term, multigenerational work and is the responsibility of all those holding power. We sincerely hope that we will see some women elected to Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar in May, who can ensure women’s voices are represented in local decision making.” The women coming forward include prominent figures in public life. Frances Murray is about to retire as rector, or headteacher, of the Nicolson Institute, the largest secondary school in the Western Isles. She is standing in Stornoway for the Scottish National party in a ward with seven candidates, including two male incumbents. Catrìona Murray, no relation, originally the only female board member of the Stornoway Trust when she was elected in 2018, a community landlord that owns the land that is home to Stornoway, the islands’ main town, decided to resign from the SNP in order to stand in May’s election. Under the party’s rules, she could not stand as an independent while remaining within the SNP; she believes independent councillors have greater autonomy. Murray said she too was disappointed so few women had come forward, even though a large number took part in the Elect Her workshop. “Honestly, I feel that there’s been an awful lot of running just to stand still,” she said. “I don’t have the second sight but it’s pretty clear that we’ll have a very small number [of women] or none at all will be elected.” Murray said far greater effort would be needed to find strategies to promote women standing after the election. One significant obstacle was the low rate of pay for councillors in Scotland, at £18,604, which meant many breadwinners, particularly parents, were unable to take the risk of quitting better-paid jobs. It also emerged that too few candidates came forward to fill the seats in two wards, in Barra, and Uig and Carloway. Had a women come forward in either ward, they would have been automatically elected. Instead, there will now be by-elections to fill the vacant seats.",News/UK news,Only eight women standing in elections for all-male Western Isles council,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/only-eight-women-standing-in-elections-for-all-male-western-isles-council
