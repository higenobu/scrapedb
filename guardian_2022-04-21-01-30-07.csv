4/21/2022,"If the 2023 men’s Six Nations fixtures look familiar it is because the organisers seem to be allergic to change. The list of games for next year’s championship is all but identical to the 2021 schedule, save for a couple of tweaked kick-off times, and is almost precisely the same as this year’s French-dominated tournament which concluded last month. For the third consecutive year England will play Scotland and Wales will meet Ireland on the opening weekend, the only notable tweak being the reversal of the final two rounds of games. Rather than England ending up in Paris again they are due to head to Dublin for their last tournament outing before the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France. It means three of England’s first four games will be at Twickenham, with not even a Friday night kick-off in Cardiff to overcome. For the second time in three years there will be no Friday night rugby whatsoever, with Six Nations organisers more focused on creating another thrilling denouement to the world’s oldest tournament. The concluding Ireland v England fixture will also be England’s final Six Nations fixture with Eddie Jones as their head coach, one of many compelling storylines which Ben Morel, the Six Nations chief executive, hopes will ensure another dramatic finale. “The 2022 Championship ended in one of the most exciting Super Saturdays in history,” said Morel. “Once again fans had to wait until the final game was played to know who this year’s champions would be and the rugby action did not disappoint.” The Women’s Six Nations, meanwhile, continues to capture the public imagination with 14,648 tickets already sold for the Red Roses’ game against Ireland in Leicester on Sunday. The existing world record for a women’s fixture is 17,740 and the England v Wales game at Kingsholm attracted almost 15,000 fans. Domestically Northampton’s Dan Biggar has been suspended for three weeks following his red card for a dangerous tackle on Gloucester’s Chris Harris and will miss his side’s next two Premiership games against Bath and Harlequins. Biggar’s suspension was halved from the entry point of six weeks because of his guilty pleas and previous clean disciplinary record and if he completes a World Rugby coaching module he will be free to play again from 2 May. Bristol’s Semi Radradra, however, is to undergo more knee surgery and will miss the rest of his club’s campaign. The Fijian had major surgery on his other knee last year after being injured in the semi-finals of the Olympic sevens event in Tokyo. Another Bears’ centre, Antoine Fritsch, will be moving to Munster at the end of the season on a three-year deal. The French-born Frisch, 25, is Irish qualified via a maternal grandmother from Dublin. Munster and Leinster will play their European Champions Cup quarter-finals on the same day, Saturday 7 May. Munster will face Toulouse at Dublin’s Aviva Stadium because of a clash with an Ed Sheeran concert at Thomond Park after which Leinster will meet the English league leaders Leicester at Welford Road, kicking off at 5.30pm.",Sport/Sport,England to face Scotland and Wales host Ireland in 2023 Six Nations openers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/england-to-face-scotland-and-wales-host-ireland-in-2023-six-nations-openers
4/21/2022,"Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said he was worried by allegations of “systemic antisemitism” within the National Union of Students, telling MPs that the government may sever links with the organisation unless it reforms. Zahawi’s intervention follows concerns raised by the Union of Jewish Students, including a social media posts by the NUS’s incoming president, Shaima Dallali, that invoked an historic assault on Jews in the Middle East. Speaking to parliament’s education committee, Zahawi said: “I am deeply concerned about the NUS – it feels to me that there is systemic antisemitism, because this is not the first time, it’s the second time I think, they have elected a leader who has got a history of antisemitic comments and statements, so that does concern me.” Dallali has apologised for the social media comments, telling the Guardian in an interview: “I’m not the same person I was. I have developed my political language to talk about Palestine and Israel. I stand by that apology.” The NUS has also said it will hold an independent investigation into allegations of antisemitism, and work with the Union of Jewish Students to resolve its concerns. But Zahawi said it was “not acceptable, in my view, that anyone in a leadership position in that organisation holds these views or propagates them in any way. “I think they need to rebuild, regain the trust of Jewish students because at the moment that trust has collapsed completely and rightly so, in my view. I think there’s a lot of work the NUS needs to do to get itself back into – I wouldn’t even say a good place – a proper, functioning representative organisation.” Zahawi told the committee that his department was looking to respond, telling MPs that “no options are off the table, including our relationship with the NUS.” Anna Firth, the Conservative MP for Southend West, also asked why the Department for Education had failed to move forward with Sharia-compliant student financing, as an alternative for student loans for Muslim students, despite a 2014 pledge to do so. Zahawi said he would investigate the delay. “We’ve got to make sure we deliver,” he said. Firth said a recent poll had found that 4,000 Muslims had been unable to go into higher education because of the lack of alternative financing.",News/Education,Nadhim Zahawi warns of ‘systemic antisemitism’ within NUS,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/20/nadhim-zahawi-warns-of-systemic-antisemitism-within-nus
4/21/2022,"The headteacher of the school where Child Q was unjustly strip-searched by police has stepped down due to ill health, the school has announced. The east London secondary school made the announcement in a letter to parents at the start of the new term, telling them that a replacement head had already been appointed. There was a national outcry last month when it emerged that the 15-year-old girl had been strip-searched by Metropolitan police officers at her school after a false accusation that she possessed cannabis. No cannabis was found. Philip Glanville, the mayor of Hackney, had earlier called for the headteacher to resign, saying it was clear that “school leadership has lost the confidence of the school, myself and the community”. The 15-year-old black girl was subjected to the traumatic strip search by police officers, with no other adults present and without her parents’ consent, in December 2020. But the event was only made public last month after the publication of a safeguarding report initiated by Hackney Council. The report found that her treatment was unjustified and that racism was “likely” to have been a factor. The Met said the actions of its officers were “regrettable” and “should never have happened”. The school’s governors also apologised, saying that “while the school was not aware that a strip search was taking place, we wholly accept that the child should not have been left in the situation that she was”. The governors also said “changes were made immediately after the incident and continued to be made”, including to the makeup and leadership of the governing board. The student was subjected to the search after being wrongly accused of possessing cannabis. The review found that she had been traumatised and required therapy after having had to expose intimate body parts during the search, which was conducted in the knowledge she was menstruating. Her parents were not informed by the school or by the officers. Legal proceedings on behalf of Child Q have been launched against the school and the Met. Her mother said the family also hoped an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation would mean the officers involved were “individually held to account and face real consequences for what they have done”. The IOPC has said a report on the student’s ordeal is being finished.",News/Education,Child Q: school says head stepping down due to ill health,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/20/child-q-strip-search-school-head-stepping-down-ill-health

4/21/2022,"“I’ve always hoped to live to see the end of the Covid safety precautions,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday evening. “We all get to burn our masks at a bonfire and then do something crazy like make out or eat free grocery store samples. But turns out that’s not how pandemics end. Not with a bang, but with a court order.” The Late Show host referred to a court order by a federal judge in Florida that struck down the mask mandate for planes and public transit. “Which is great news for anyone who ever rode public transport and said ‘this is way too sanitary’,” Colbert quipped. The ruling came from Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, a Tampa-based federal judge appointed by Trump after he lost the 2020 election. “You can’t let Florida make health decisions for the entire country!” Colbert said. “That’s not smart! The Florida food pyramid is just gator jerky and meth.” In a 59-page ruling, Mizelle argued that the CDC exceeded their mandate in requiring masks on planes and public transit, and that their power was limited to cleaning property, not requiring people to take proper hygienic steps. “Yes you cannot force people to follow basic hygiene,” Colbert deadpanned. “You can only make them clean property, explains the new bathroom sign: ‘Before returning to work, employees must wash this sign.’” Mizelle also argued that masks were a futile public health measure because “wearing a mask cleans nothing. At most, it traps virus droplets.” “That’s the mask’s job, you dummy!” Colbert exclaimed. “So my droplets don’t get on you! That’s like saying, ‘This diaper is useless, every time I put one on my baby it fills up with poop.” All major airline carriers immediately changed their mask policies, with some announcing the change mid-flight. “Look, people can take this news however they want, but it’s unfair for people who might be immunocompromised or traveling with unvaccinated children to change the rules mid-flight,” Colbert noted. “That’s like being told halfway through a dinner party that it’s an orgy.” Things that shouldn’t change mid-flight: cabin pressure, seats, and mask mandates. pic.twitter.com/zE3g0JYsDz On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also commented on the mask mandate change that took effect mid-flight for some passengers. “I don’t care what you think of masks – you have to admit, it is insane to change a safety rule in the middle of a flight!” he said. “Just as a general rule, nothing should change mid-flight, ever. Nothing. I don’t want the course changing, I don’t want the cabin pressure changing. I definitely don’t want my seat changing so that you can sit next to your wife. “The point is: a lot of people only booked that flight in the first place because they felt safe knowing that everyone had to wear masks,” he added. “You can’t just flip that while people are already on the plane. You have to give people a chance to decide if this is something they want to do.” The swift policy change is “crazy”, he added. “This would be like if a rollercoaster decided to change its safety policies when you’re already on the ride.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel checked in yet again on the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, 18 months after he lost. According to the New York Times, several Trump allies who initially tried to discredit the election through bogus voter fraud and conspiracy theories have shifted to a wild sequel: that by “decertifying” the 2020 vote in several states, they could reverse the outcome. “What is it going to take for him to get over this?” Kimmel wondered. “Does the McRib have to come back? I mean really, you lost! America is just not that into you. “I think they think if they complain long enough eventually they’ll get their way,” he continued. “This is the presidency, this is not the Snyder cut of Justice League. You’re not going to get your way.” In other Trump news, a massive outage at his supposed alternative to Twitter, Truth Social, left many of its small handful of users unable to access the platform. The company’s CEO, Devin Nunes, “attempted to put a spin on his incompetence” with a statement: “As many of you know our team has been working non stop to ensure that TRUTH can not be shut down by tech tyrants,” he wrote in part. “Which means he probably forgot to pay the electric bill,” Kimmel joked. “Why would tyrants try to shut down a service that barely works,” Kimmel added. “In order to shut something down, it has to be up.”",Arts/Culture,Colbert on mask mandates: ‘You can’t let Florida make health decisions’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/20/stephen-colbert-mask-mandates-late-show-recap
4/21/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. Today’s newsletter is inspired by an email from Iain Noble (hello again, Iain!), who wrote in with a question that tapped into something that’s been on my mind lately. Iain wrote: “One of the criticisms I often hear from non-gamers is that video games are very repetitious. Admittedly there is an element of truth in that many games require some grinding to level up characters, make money and get equipment. Do you think there is a specific personality type that is OK with that, rather like rats repeatedly pressing the same button to get a reward?” This question reminds me of a story my partner tells about his grandad’s reaction to video games in 1983: “it’s all just pushing buttons, innit?” (This was the partial inspiration for the name of this newsletter, incidentally.) I mean, he’s not wrong, in a way, but also, that’s like saying that reading books is just turning pages. When you don’t understand something well, what you see from the outside is just a series of baffling actions. If you don’t care about tennis then it’s just two people hitting a ball at each other; if you do care about it, and especially if you have any knowledge of it, it’s a battle of wills, a dramatic tactical dance. A few weeks ago I answered a question from a reader who was berated by his boss for playing on his Nintendo Switch on his lunch break, and a few readers got in touch to share their own stories of the bizarre social stigma that – still! – sometimes comes with gaming. “Wang on about this book or that, discuss the merits or otherwise of the latest Netflix murder-porn if you like, talk about sport – any sport – endlessly and at length, but say one word about how deeply absorbed you are with the latest interactive masterpiece and you may as well have just violently guffed for the looks you get,” wrote Steve Holmes, who also says that eyebrows were raised when he asked for Elden Ring for his 50th birthday. The thing is that almost anything seems boring and inexplicable if you are watching from the outside and don’t understand it. To people who don’t understand games, it probably does look like we’re just rats pushing buttons. But an athlete or a musician also does the same things over and over again, when practising – and they find meaning, enjoyment and satisfaction in it. In games we’re often developing a skill, whether we’re playing Street Fighter or Fifa or bashing our heads against the same boss in Dark Souls. And some people find it soothing to do the same tasks over and over for a predictable reward. Every player has a different tolerance for repetition in video games, and I do think it comes down to personality. Some of us can apply ourselves with dedication to repetitive tasks such as grinding for XP, farming for equipment or beating a high score, and find pride in the result; others, like me, are novelty seekers, continually looking for a new experience or challenge. How we play games often reflects how we approach life in general, and where we find our joy. One of the great things about games is that they allow us to express and explore who we are and how we like to behave in all sorts of interesting contexts. I certainly don’t feel like a rat in a cage when I’m playing them (unless I’m playing some awful free-to-play thing won’t let me continue unless I pay some money, and if that’s the case, I’m gonna stop playing pretty quickly). I feel like an adventurer, an explorer. It might look like I’m just pushing buttons, but actually I’m learning, thinking, experiencing, reacting. I might even be bettering myself, if developing superhuman Guitar Hero skills or crafting a full set of Rathalos armour in Monster Hunter counts as self-betterment. So, no, I don’t think you need a high tolerance for repetition to enjoy video games. The main difference between people who understand video games and those who are dismissive of them isn’t personality, in my experience – it’s exposure. If people cared to look more closely at games and the people who play them, they’d see that it’s a hell of a lot more than pushing buttons. An atmospheric and unexpectedly emotional puzzle game, LEGO Builder’s Journey tells a story about growing up and what it means to be a parent using minimalist blocks. Each level is a Lego diorama that you can change – or solve – by moving a few bricks around. Where most of the Lego games are gaudy, enjoyable slapstick takes on giant film and entertainment franchises, this one feels more like something that a bunch of art school students came up with during a game jam. It’s exceptionally relaxing and tactile, with soothing sound and a calm aesthetic. This game has been around for a few years, but it’s newly out on PlayStation this week – I’m glad more people can now play it.

Today’s question is from James Brewer: “I used to be really into gaming on my PC (and SNES if we’re going back that far!), especially games like the Kings Quest series, Monkey Island and 7th Guest/11th Hour. I’ve tried to get back into gaming recently but haven’t found anything that grabs my interest, apart from Uncharted. Are there any games or series you’d recommend?” The point-and-click adventure game genre that captured you back in the 90s kind of died out for a while, but good news: it’s back now. Broken Age, part of the first wave of the adventure-game comeback, is a wonderful, surreal story with a great cast. Thimbleweed Park might scratch that same itch. I’ve never played The Book of Unwritten Tales, but it is a comedy fantasy game that’s spoken of fondly by my adventure-game-loving friends. The first few Telltale game series were landmark narrative games, particularly The Walking Dead – they’ve got no puzzles, really, but they definitely are part of the same family tree as Monkey Island et al. For a series that’s nothing but atmospheric puzzles, look at The Room. And because you also enjoyed Uncharted, I reckon you’d be up for some more action games with gripping action, the odd puzzle and decent stories: try the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot and Rise of the Tomb Raider (but not Shadow of the Tomb Raider, that game’s a mess). And because it has a surreal air of mystery, like Kings Quest, you might like the creepy English narrative adventure Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture. I’m also going to recommend Portal and Portal 2, if you missed them at the time, just because everybody in the world should play them.",Arts/Games,Pushing Buttons: Why there is still a bizarre social stigma to playing games,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/20/pushing-buttons-video-games-social-stigma
4/21/2022,"Russia’s war in Ukraine is not going according to plan. The sinking of the Moskva – the flagship of the Black Sea fleet – is the latest major military setback. In the course of almost two months, Russia has lost six major generals and between 15,000-20,000 troops, all the while failing to secure any appreciable gains. Reports of low morale and defection, coupled with sightings of mercenaries deployed by the Kremlin, hint at recruitment problems. This, along with Russia’s apparent inability to replenish lost military equipment – a consequence of western sanctions – has led some observers to wonder whether the Russian war machine is running out of road. Despite this, there are few indications that Russia is considering cutting its losses. By all accounts, ceasefire negotiations have reached a dead end, with Russia refusing to compromise on any of its initial positions. After his recent face-to-face meeting with Putin, the Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said that Putin “believes he is winning the war”. The Kremlin is suffering major setbacks, but will not alter its negotiating strategy. This isn’t mere bravado. Research on authoritarian regimes has shown that in many cases, the direction wars take is not solely determined by battlefield success or failure. Rather, major decisions – especially about when to end the war – are often dictated by the interests of the key political players within the country. Understanding the Kremlin’s decision-making, therefore, requires zeroing in on the key power dynamics within the regime. Putin’s domestic political base consists of two rival power blocs: the intelligence apparatus and the military. Both have suffered major blows to their credibility during the war. However, as they continue to jockey for Putin’s favour, both also have a vested interest in prolonging the conflict in some form. The intelligence bloc includes the current and former leadership of the FSB (the Russian successor of the Soviet KGB) and other intelligence agencies. Having started his career as a KGB operative, Putin has maintained a symbiotic relationship with the agency throughout his tenure. Several FSB leaders are long-time members of Putin’s inner circle and his confidants. The other power bloc consists of the heads of the military and defence structures, such as the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, the chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, and the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. These individuals have earned the trust of the Russian leader as a result of decades of service and unwavering loyalty. Despite notable similarities – conservative, anti-democratic and anti-west – the interests of the two blocs are not perfectly aligned. The intelligence community’s focus is domestic, broadly defined to include the former Soviet space. Its specialties are controlling dissent, staging covert operations, and political sabotage. The military community, as its name implies, is the party of war. It derives its influence from foreign policy adventurism. The intelligence agencies reign during peaceful times, the military rules during war. The unforeseen setbacks experienced in the course of the invasion have thrown a wrench into the usual power dynamics between the two blocs and the Russian leader. For Putin, the war has revealed the true state of affairs within both the military and intelligence apparatus. Intelligence took the first blow. Moscow’s original plan was to take Kyiv in two days. Russian troops brought parade uniforms, expecting to march down Khreshchatyk in a victory celebration. The ambitious plan was based on intelligence reports that Ukrainians would greet Russian soldiers as liberators – false information that led to massive strategic miscalculations and losses during the war’s first stage. The military has also come under scrutiny. The war has shown the world the pathetic state of the Russian army, a consequence of decades of deferred maintenance and blatant corruption. Low morale, lack of training, and equipment failures have shone an unflattering light on what is apparently the world’s second strongest army. As a result of these failures, Putin has learned that some of his closest friends and allies have lied, misappropriated funds and forged reports for a significant part of his rule. His inner circle may not be as trustworthy as he thought. There is some evidence that Putin may not have access to all of this information – the dispatches he receives may downplay Russia’s setbacks. Even so, unconfirmed reports of the arrests of top intelligence officials responsible for the situation in Ukraine indicate that the Russian leader is aware of, and has reacted to, some of the intelligence failures. And speculation has also surrounded the recent decrease in public appearances by Shoigu and Gerasimov. In general, continuing the war should protect the position of the military. However displeased, Putin cannot afford to purge his military command during the war. As long as this war lasts, the leaders of the military will not be held accountable, despite their poor performance. Hence, the military command has a strong preference for stretching out the war. This puts the intelligence agencies at a relative disadvantage. They have lost influence after their early failures, and they will lose even more should Russian troops manage to achieve greater military success. The end of the war may bring a real reckoning for earlier failed intelligence. Because of this, the best possible scenario for top intelligence operatives is a frozen war, with little fighting but no permanent resolution. This would allow them to re-establish their standing with the Russian leader the way they know best – through covert operations in the occupied territories. Both groups have an interest in dragging out the war, even if things continue to go poorly: the fog of war protects them from having to answer for their failures. Neither group will lobby Putin to end the war, and Putin himself will not stop until he can claim some sort of victory. And so, the war will go on.

4/21/2022,"Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, will address MPs about the climate crisis after a protester’s hunger strike campaign. Angus Rose, 52, refused to eat for 37 days during his vigil outside parliament as he demanded the scientific adviser give a public address to MPs and ministers about the climate crisis. He has now ended his hunger strike, 17kg lighter, after the all-party parliamentary group on climate change said it would host Vallance for an address on the issue. A spokesperson for the group, which is led by the Green MP Caroline Lucas, told Rose they “will be happy to host a briefing on climate change for MPs and cabinet members, from the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. This event would be held in the new parliamentary session, likely May-June … the briefing will also be recorded, sent to all MPs after the event and made publicly available.” Vallance has agreed to do the briefing, representatives of Lucas told the Guardian, and a date for it will be set shortly. Though Rose had originally asked for Vallance to do a televised briefing of cabinet rather than address a parliament committee, he said he was happy with the outcome. During his hunger strike, a group of 79 leading scientists, including the former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, wrote a letter supporting his demand, saying “briefing on the climate and ecological crises would help our leaders to enact the right policies to decarbonise our society at the required pace, while also preserving biodiversity”. Rose has been admitted to hospital as a precaution, but has begun eating again. He said he was feeling weak and dizzy on standing after such a long time without food. Rose said: “Many parliamentarians seem unaware of the frightening implications of the climate crisis; though the information is available to them, there has been no system in place to ensure they engage and understand it. This is what has been so frustrating. My hope is that if MPs understand the science, they will act with the required urgency.” On 28 January 2020, the prime minister was given a briefing led by Vallance on the science of the climate emergency. Johnson, who had disputed climate scientists’ claims in the past, later said it had been his “road to Damascus” moment on climate science. He told reporters government scientists had “run through it all” and that anthropogenic climate change had turned out to be “very hard to dispute”. Rose and other campaigners have asked for such briefings to be made public, and for all ministers and MPs to be informed of the science. The hunger striker said he had taken the most inspiration from Guillermo Fernandez, a Swiss man who claimed a victory after 39 days of hunger strike when scientists announced they would meet Swiss MPs to discuss climate science. Lucas said: “I’m relieved that Angus Rose has ended his hunger strike, which required immense courage, resilience and determination, and can now start to work towards recovering his health. However it should never have to take someone risking their own life in this way to highlight what scientists have been telling us for decades – that we are, in the words of UN secretary general António Guterres, ‘on a fast track to climate disaster’. “If the government wants to protect future generations, like Angus’s niece and nephew, then it needs to drop the paltry half-measures, and dead cat distractions – and start acting like lives depend on it.”",News/Environment,MPs to get scientific briefing on climate after activist’s hunger strike,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/20/mps-to-get-scientific-briefing-on-climate-after-activists-hunger-strike
4/21/2022,"This week the Iceland midfielder Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir voiced her frustration over the choice of venues for this summer’s women’s Euros in England. She questioned why two of her country’s games would be played at the 5,000-capacity Manchester City Academy Stadium and her remarks highlighted a number of important questions, chiefly among them whether the FA was ambitious enough in its choice of stadia and whether it has done enough to adapt to the accelerating growth of the game? Arguably, the answer to both questions is no. There can be some sympathy towards the position the FA has found itself in four years on from crafting the bid to host the tournament. Back in August 2018, when the FA revealed its plans, and in December of that year when the solo bid was revealed to have been successful, women’s football was in a very different place. However, the signs of potentially rapid growth were already there and were either overlooked, ignored or woefully underestimated. A staggering four million people had tuned in to watch the Lionesses’ semi-final exit to the Netherlands on Channel 4 the preceding summer. The Dutch, who hosted the tournament, rode to victory in the Euro 2017 final on an orange wave, with mass carnival-like fan walks to the grounds swamping Dutch streets before every sold-out Netherlands game. As Gunnarsdóttir pointed out when speaking to the podcast Their Pitch: “I don’t know what’s going on in their heads or if they’re even following women’s football. Because if you would, it’s just common sense. Women’s football’s exploding, it’s getting so much better, and it’s just stupid to speak about it because it doesn’t even make sense.” It was, and always has been, clear that major international competitions qualitatively impact the growth of the women’s game. Each tournament dramatically accelerates the development of the sport. With a World Cup in 2019 on the horizon, the launching of the WSL as a full-time professional league in September 2018 and the target of doubling the fanbase and participation domestically by 2020 in place, legitimate concerns were raised when the grounds to host the 2021 (now 2022) tournament were unveiled.

Brighton’s Amex Stadium, Wembley Stadium and Brentford Community Stadium in London, Milton Keynes’s Stadium MK, Nottingham’s City Ground, Rotherham’s New York Stadium, Sheffield’s Bramall Lane and Southampton’s St Mary’s completed the lineup. This list felt hugely unambitious then, and looks almost ludicrously low-key now. It seems to have been drawn up at a static moment in time, one shortly after the 2017 Euros, that looked to build on the 240,000 tickets sold across that event but was overly cautious about the likely growth of the game in the coming years. The FA has been caught out. The governing body’s head of tournament delivery, Chris Bryant, hinted at that when he told the Guardian in March: “What I would say is that the level of expectation for women’s football is massively growing, to the extent that we’re keeping up with that and managing expectations, which is maybe not the easiest thing to do. We’re definitely doing it, but the event we deliver this summer will be far bigger than the event we planned and assumed when we were bidding. France 2019 was a massive part of that, it was a wake-up call.” The tournament delivery ambitions have been out of sync with the strategy for the development of the women’ game in England, one that pushed for accelerated growth and predicted huge strides. The FA was not unaware of the problem and the addition of Old Trafford as the venue for the opening game of the tournament highlighted a willingness to expand its ambitions. However, the announcement that the woefully inaccessible Leigh Sports Village, with a capacity of 12,000, would be replacing the 30,000 capacity City Ground and hosting three group games and a quarter-final was extremely disappointing. With those changes around 700,000 tickets have been made available for the tournament. That number is far beyond the 240,000 sold (of 480,000 on offer) in 2017 with an average attendance of 7,969 but two years later at the 2019 World Cup, in neighbouring France, over 1.1 million tickets were sold and the tournament had an average attendance of 21,756. It is important to say that clubs and cities had to bid to be a part of the tournament and many top Premier League sides and councils did not throw their grounds into the mix. However, just how much pressure was put on those in positions of power and to what extent the huge potential of the tournament was explained, at a time when many clubs were still waking up to the women’s game and its potential, is unknown. So far, eight fixtures for the Euros have sold out, including the Old Trafford opener, all of England’s group games, the Wembley final and Iceland’s two fixtures at Manchester City’s Academy Stadium, which prompted Gunnarsdóttir’s criticism. Uefa responded to Swedish website fotbollskanalen that they feel they “have the right mix of stadia”. Gunnarsdóttir certainly did not hold back. “It’s shocking,” she said. “You’re playing in England, you have so many stadiums, and we have a training ground from City. It’s just embarrassing. Women’s football today, they’re filling out the stadiums. If you see Barcelona against Real Madrid, we have 95,000 [official attendance was 91,533] watching the game,” she said. Two ends of the Academy Stadium are standing terraces and one end of Leigh Sports Village is also standing only – something not permitted in Uefa competitions, meaning capacity will be reduced from the 7,000 and 12,000 maximum capacities respectively, or a temporary seating solution will have to be found. The psychological impact of hosting games at the biggest and best stadia is often overlooked. Those grounds have a pull as the twice sold-out Nou Camp for Barcelona’s Champions League quarter-final and semi-final or the WSL record-breaking crowd of 38,262 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in November 2019 demonstrate. More importantly though, putting the women’s game on the biggest and best stages shows it is valued, is being championed and it is not second best. If we want fans to treat the women’s game the same way they do the men’s game, then women’s football has to be treated the same way by the FA, clubs and other footballing bodies.",Sport/Football,Euro 2022 stadium choices appeared unambitious in 2018 – they look worse now | Suzanne Wrack,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/euro-2022-stadium-choices-appeared-unambitious-in-2018-they-look-worse-now
4/21/2022,"MTK Global, the boxing management company founded by the alleged Irish gangster Daniel Kinahan, has ceased operations. The group – which represents more than 200 fighters – announced on Wednesday that it was closing at the end of the month after what it described as “unfair scrutiny” since the US Government sanctions on Kinahan. The Irishman has no criminal convictions and has always denied any wrongdoing. The statement read: “As a business we have faced unprecedented levels of unfair scrutiny and criticism since the sanctioning by the US government of Daniel Joseph Kinahan. “It is a matter of public record that Mr Kinahan’s involvement in MTK ceased in 2017, and despite repeated reassurances in this regard, unfounded allegations about his ongoing association with us and our fighters persist. “Since leading promoters have now informed us that they will be severing all ties with MTK and will no longer work with our fighters, we have taken the difficuly decision to cease operations at the end of this month. “MTK prospered because we always put the long term interest of our fighters at the heart of what we do. Our priority in the weeks ahead will be to ensure that our world class boxers are supported to find new partnerships as swiftly as possible. “MTK gyms are operated independently so will remain open for the foreseeable future. Further announcements will be made in due course. Thank you to all the fans who have supported us over the last decade.”",Sport/Sport,"MTK Global, boxing company founded by suspected crime boss Kinahan, folds",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/boxing-company-mtk-founded-by-suspected-crime-boss-daniel-kinahan-folds
