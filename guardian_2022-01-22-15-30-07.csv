1/22/2022,"Judy Baca still recalls the day in the 1970s when the curator of an exhibit showcasing the work of emerging Los Angeles artists told her she couldn’t possibly include Baca in the show. “These are only people touched by an angel,” Baca remembers the woman saying about the the all-male group of artists she had selected. The message was clear: Baca was not worthy of a museum. Fifty years later, Baca’s an internationally celebrated artist, whose large-scale works of public art have left an unmatched imprint on the artistic landscape of LA. And the Chicana muralist, scholar and activist is now receiving long overdue mainstream recognition. The Museum of Latin American Art (Molaa) in Long Beach, California, is running the first major retrospective on her work, and a major show at the Museum of Contemporary Art (Moca) in Los Angeles is planned for September.  “I never expected to be part of the 1% that would live on my art,” Baca, 75, said in a recent interview. “This is the first time in my career in which people are seeking to buy my work, to own pieces of the Judy Baca collection.” For years, Baca said, the white, male-dominated art industry was uninterested in her. “My work has been ignored a lot in LA … and the men here have been pretty profoundly unable to see women as their peers. That’s been the struggle of my whole life as a Chicana and activist and feminist. It’s created a devil-may-care attitude for me. I had to just perceive what I was doing as significant for myself and my community and move ahead with willfulness and belief, buoyed by the community people I worked with – not by the arts.” Baca was born in Watts, an LA neighborhood known for the 1965 uprisings, and grew up in Pacoima, near the LA river. Her grandparents came from Mexico to La Junta, Colorado during the Mexican Revolution, a story told in her Denver airport mural, La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra, and at the entrance of her Molaa retrospective. “This was the first massive migration of Mexican people into the United States … although in some ways, we didn’t cross the border, the border crossed us,” she said. While her mother worked at a factory in her early childhood, her grandmother raised her and had a huge influence on her creativity: “My grandmother had a special relationship with the spirit world. She would begin my day by saying, ‘What did you dream?’ … I realized there was more to living than simply what was visible, tangibly.” Her grandma’s indigenous identity also shaped her: “People were not able to own their indigeneity, because it was not considered attractive or good. But my grandmother was indigenous and she looked Apache.” Baca’s grandmother practiced a kind of “curanderismo”, meaning people came to her for counsel and healing. Baca’s mother worried she would not earn a living as an artist and encouraged her to get a degree in education – a path that led her to muralism. Baca created her first mural while working at a Catholic high school, as a way to channel the students’ interest in graffiti. (She was later fired from the school after marching against the Vietnam war.) In 1974, she launched the city of LA’s first mural program, which produced over 400 murals and soon after, co-founded the Social and Public Art Resource Center (Sparc), a public art community organization, housed in an old jailhouse. Baca began building the Great Wall of Los Angeles, in 1976 along the Tujunga wash in the San Fernando Valley, with the idea of painting a “tattoo on the scar where the river once ran”. Originally named The History of California, the mural is one of the longest in the world and depicts forgotten histories of people of color in California. Over five years, she worked with hundreds of youth – some of whom were diverted from the criminal justice system – to paint a visual history of stories that disappeared along with the river, from prehistoric times to the 1950s. The narratives within the 2,754-ft mural include a little-known massacre of Chinese people in LA in 1871; the mass deportations of Mexican Americans in the 1930s; and a portrait of Luisa Moreno, a farm-workers labor organizer in the 1940s. “What I learned from the young people who participated is that it changed forever the way that they saw each other,” Baca said. “We were in segregated communities … but they were all sort of ‘rejects’, thought to be young people who will never succeed. But that mixing with each other, which has continued for a lifetime, was a remarkable change.” In 1980, Baca became a professor in studio art at the University of California, the only Chicana to have a tenured position in visual arts and one of a handful of senior Chicana professors across the public university system. The Molaa exhibit includes more than 110 of Baca’s works, spotlighting the history of the Great Wall, and featuring paintings, sculptures and early drawings. There are portraits of her dressed as a “pachuca” in the 1970s for LA’s first all-Chicana show; her striking Josefina: Ofrenda to the Domestic Worker print; a vendor cart painted with histories of the criminalization of undocumented people; and study drawings of the World Wall, her mural that has traveled around the globe. Gabriela Urtiaga, Molaa’s chief curator, said in an email that Baca “has always [been] and continues to be a pivotal figure looking for new alternatives to speak about silenced voices, and the figure of women as an essential part of her creative work”, adding, “Judy rethinks a collective memory and identity as a fundamental link in the construction of women’s power – Chicana, Latina, women of color.” Some of the most fascinating displays capture obstacles she overcame. On a draft drawing of a mural commissioned for the University of Southern California in the 1990s, she wrote down critiques from administrators who tried to censor the painting, which depicted conflicts, violence and resistance movements involving Latinos in LA: “Judy, we believe that this mural is not understandable to an Anglo audience and is too negative. The history you represent is depressing.” “I do not make the history, I just paint about it,” she responded on the mural draft. The exhibit also chronicles the reaction to Danzas Indigenas, a monument she created in 1994 at an LA rail station, meant to honor indigenous history in the region. In 2005, an anti-immigrant group, Save Our State, protested the monument; the footage on display closely resembles the white supremacist rallies of recent years and the growing push to erase teachings of racism in America. “I hope the show reminds people that we’re dealing with the same thing over and over again, and if we don’t fix it, we have to keep reliving it,” Baca said, adding that seeing decades of her work curated in a museum format has been validating. “I always thought I’d make a work and it’d go out into the ether, never to be seen again or spoken about,” she said. “But I realized that when I was making it, that I was processing through my hands, and through my art. I was finding a way to live with truth that was hard and difficult. It was a way of keeping me sane, and keeping me in the process of healing, and healing those around me … and I’ve learned that my instincts were good.” Why does she believe she is finally getting proper recognition? “Maybe they think I’m gonna die,” she said with a laugh, adding that the recent social justice uprisings have forced a reckoning in the arts. For so long, she said, “It was the gatekeepers, and the remarkable failure to deal with the Latino community in any real way. I think it’s a lot about the referencing and metaphors that define a people as ‘aliens’.” Last year, the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art acquired the archives related to the Great Wall, and the Andrew W Mellon Foundation awarded Sparc $5m to expand the wall to include stories from the 1960s to 2020. The 1960s section will feature a “generation on fire” fighting Jim Crow and Alabama firemen hosing protesters. The 70s will start with the Alcatraz occupation, with a quote from Oglala Lakota leader Red Cloud: “They made us many promises … but they kept but one; they promised to take our land, and they did.” While Baca is hopeful about her future projects, she is disheartened about the state of the art form: “Muralism as a whole has been diminished in LA. It’s totally commercial. The only things that can get made are those paid by corporations that want to decorate buildings.” She lamented that the city lacked the kind of public program that she launched in the 70s, noting how murals can shape our understanding of history and “create sites of public memory” when done with communities: “Murals can do some amazing work in the world, because they live in the places where people live and work, because they can be made in relationship to the people who see them, because the people themselves can have input, if it’s done in a profound way. And that’s what I intend to keep doing as long as I’m standing here on earth.” Judy Baca: Memorias de Nuestra Tierra, a Retrospective is at the Museum of Latin American Art through March.

1/22/2022,"A friend, Barry Horne, who kept meticulous weather records in his home village of Edlesborough in Buckinghamshire from 1969 until 1999, was not convinced about climate change. He contended that the weather varied too much even over a 30-year period. Just in case he was wrong, however, he printed off his entire records and presented them to me so that if either of us lived long enough, the statistics might help with the answer.  He did concede that one set of figures, the number of days snow fell in a year, had shown a general downward trend over the period, despite sharp annual variations. By the 1990s it was down to 10 days of snowfall a year on average. With this winter halfway through, we have had one snowfall this year – 10 would be exceptional. Perhaps his record of air frosts is more remarkable. In the 1970s it was not unusual for the winter months to have more than 20 air frosts recorded, and in January and February 1979 there were only three nights without one. That year March had 22. Sadly Barry died before we could settle the argument but air frosts would have been the clincher.

1/22/2022,"A Jewish couple from Tennessee has filed a lawsuit against the state’s Department of Children’s Services after a state-funded Christian program denied them foster care services for religious reasons. According to the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Elizabeth and Gabriel Rutan-Ram signed up for the foster-parent training class and home-study certification process last January at the Holston United Methodist Home for Children.  On 21 January 2021, the same day the Rutan-Rams were scheduled to begin the foster-parent-training class at Holston, an employee “emailed Ms Rutan-Ram to inform her that Holston would not serve the Rutan-Rams because of the couple’s Jewish faith”. The employee wrote, “As a Christian organization, our executive team made the decision several years ago to only provide adoption services to prospective adoptive families that share our belief system in order to avoid conflicts or delays with future service delivery.” In a statement released earlier this week, Gabriel Rutan-Ram criticized the organization, saying, “It’s infuriating to learn our tax dollars are funding discrimination against us. If an agency is getting tax money to provide a service, then everyone should be served – it shouldn’t matter whether you’re Jewish, Catholic or an atheist. We’re all citizens of Tennessee, regardless of our religion.” In response to the lawsuit, Brad Williams, president and CEO of Holston said that the organization seeks to place children with families that “agree with our statement of faith”. “Vulnerable children should not lose access to Christian families who choose to become foster or adoptive parents. Holston Home places children with families that agree with our statement of faith, and forcing Holston Home to violate our beliefs and place children in homes that do not share our faith is wrong and contrary to a free society,” Williams said in a statement to NBC News. In early 2020, the state’s Republican governor, Bill Lee, signed a controversial adoption bill that allows faith-based foster care and adoption programs to use taxpayer money, even if the programs exclude families of various religious backgrounds and sexual orientations. Lee, who is Christian, called defending religious beliefs “very important”. Other states with similar legislation include South Dakota, Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Michigan, Oklahoma and Mississippi. The Anti-Defamation League’s Southern Division criticized Lee at the time in a statement that said: “Allowing a taxpayer-funded child placement agency to discriminate is outrageous. No child should be denied a loving foster or adoptive home simply because of a prospective parent’s religion, sexual orientation or identity.”",News/US news,Tennessee Jewish couple’s lawsuit accuses Christian agency of denying them foster care services,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/22/tennessee-jewish-couple-sues-state-christian-adoption-agency-denies-them-services
1/22/2022,"Iam on my hands and knees on the kitchen floor, trying to install a new cat flap while the cat watches. “The central ring section is adjustable,” I tell the cat. “You know, depending on the thickness of your door.” The cat looks at me, then at the flap.  “For the same reason it comes with three sets of screws – short, medium and long,” I say. “I don’t have to measure because I have the screws from the old flap, which are clearly medium.” The cat yawns, ostentatiously. The old cat flap was wrecked when the dog crashed through it in the middle of the night and ended up wearing it like a skirt. The cat never really mastered the old flap anyway – he sat in front of it for hours, delicately prying it open with one claw and watching it fall back into place. “You don’t pull, you push it, you idiot,” I would say. The cat didn’t listen. The new flap won’t be any easier to work out, because it is as near to exactly like the old one as possible: same make, same size. The actual model is out of production, but this, I’m assured by wife, is the closest match. I want the replacement process to be seamless – like for like. I don’t want to have to saw a bigger hole, or buy a new door. When I take the new flap out of the box I am gratified to see how much it resembles its predecessor. It appears to be put together the same way the old one came apart, so the instructions are superfluous. But nothing is that simple. The tolerances between hole and housing are tight: all the components need to be precisely aligned to meet in the middle, and this is difficult to manage when they are on either side of a door. It doesn’t help that my assistant is a cat. I move outside, with the cat following, and drop to my knees on the wet brick. It’s dark already, and a light rain is falling. I push a medium length screw into its intended hole, but it doesn’t find the corresponding threaded slot in the component on the inside of the door. Plastic creaks alarmingly when I try to tighten it. “Arse,” I say. As I speak a second medium screw falls from my mouth, bounces once on the brick patio and lands in front of the cat. He bats it away into the darkness, and looks up at me. “If you’re not part of the solution,” I say, “you’re part of the problem.” Finally, with the open door pinched between my knees and my arms stretched at full length, I manage to finesse the pieces into an arrangement that allows two medium screws to span the distance between them. With everything tightened, the new cat flap is firmly secured in place. “Allow me to demonstrate,” I say to the cat, pushing a finger against the flap from the outside in. The flap does not move. I find my wife at her computer. “Have you put it in already?” she says. “Well done.” “It has a magnetic lock,” I say. “You have to be wearing a special collar to go through it.” “Yeah,” my wife says. “It’s to stop other people’s cats getting in.” “Our cat is too stupid to use a regular cat flap,” I say. “I know,” she says. “And it only comes with one collar,” I say. “What about the dog?” “It was the only kind they make that matched the measurements you gave me,” she says. “How did you imagine this working out?” I say. “I figured you could just dismantle the mechanism,” she says. “Did you,” I say. “I did,” she says. There are few things more dispiriting than one of my wife’s sudden demonstrations of faith in my abilities – they are infrequent, but they are wholly random and largely misplaced. With the new cat flap now uninstalled, I sit down at the kitchen table with the parts. The magnetic lock is, as you might imagine, not designed to be got at. A lot of ugly prying and cracking must take place to gain access. Once I’m in, though, I find myself fascinated by the simple beauty of the mechanism, by the little weighted seesaw that holds the lock in position, and the magnet that counteracts it when a suitably collared pet approaches. I look up to find the cat sitting on the table watching me. “Miaow,” it says. “Believe me,” I say. “You wouldn’t get it.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Tim Dowling: the cat and I are both struggling with the new cat flap,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/22/tim-dowling-the-cat-and-i-are-both-struggling-with-the-new-cat-flap
1/22/2022,"Peering through binoculars, Mykola Chekman pointed to the bridge connecting Ukraine to Russian-controlled Crimea. “It’s not the first time the peninsula has been occupied,” he observed. He added: “Crimea has seen a lot of war.” Chekman – a Ukrainian army photographer – was standing on the castellated tower of what was once a tourist cafe. It is now a base for Ukrainian forces, facing off against their invisible Russian counterparts across a shimmering expanse of water and duck-filled lagoons.  The abandoned building is situated in the village of Chonhar in Ukraine’s southern Kherson province. A Ukrainian checkpoint with a blue and yellow flag marks the de facto border with what Moscow considers to be Russia, a ragged group of houses over the bridge. In the east of the country, Russian-backed separatists regularly lob grenades and shoot at their Ukrainian adversaries. The Chonhar frontline, by contrast, is tranquil. A handful of civilians arrive in a white minivan and cross the last section on foot, rolling small cases. Despite this apparent normality Kyiv is taking no chances. Soldiers stand guard in a network of trenches reinforced with wooden pallets. They peer at the enemy through letterbox-style positions, guns at the ready. For now, the only intruder is a ball of tumbleweed. A cold wind blows. The cafe’s tower, reached via a perilous staircase, serves as an observation platform. It is topped with a decorative black finial featuring a Crimea map. On a ground floor wall someone has scrawled: “Putin is a prick”. Nearby, a BTR armoured personnel carrier sat hidden behind a fir tree. “Vladimir Putin dreams of making a land corridor between Russian-occupied territories in the Donbas and Crimea. We won’t let him,” Ivan Arefiev – a military officer – said. He added: “We are ready for whatever happens, including an attack.” There are few obvious signs of a Russian military presence. At night the soldiers say they can hear the roar of enemy tanks as they manoeuvre, concealed behind a small wood. But the stark fact is the Kremlin could advance from here at any time: from land, sea or air. With 100,000 Russian troops now encamped on its borders, Ukraine is surrounded. In the south, Moscow’s armed forces may break out from Crimea and move north and then east along the coast, a flat 250km strip encompassing the Ukrainian ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol. The strategic goal would be to link Crimea to the separatist mini-fiefdoms of Donetsk and Luhansk. Moscow effectively seized these territories in spring 2014, installing and arming local proxies and starting a conflict that has gone on ever since. In the east, Russian tanks may advance across the border towards the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and smash through the “line of contact” between the separatists and the Ukrainian army. In the west, Russian forces are stationed near to Odessa in Transnistria, a breakaway republic in the east of Moldova. The most ominous developments, meanwhile, are playing out in the north. The Kremlin has moved troops, fighter jets and heavy weapons to Belarus, ahead of what it says are large-scale military exercises next month. Tactical battalions from Russia’s far east have arrived, bringing with them Uragan self-propelled multiple rocket launchers and S-400 air missile defence systems. This formidable attack force is within striking distance of Kyiv and its pro-western government, 200km away. So far talks between Russia and the west including a meeting on Friday between US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov have gone nowhere. Russia is demanding a cold war-style zone of influence in eastern Europe and the withdrawal from former Warsaw pact powers of Nato forces. All of which has led the US and its allies to conclude an invasion is imminent – something Joe Biden this week acknowledged to be “likely”. Experts in Kyiv say any Russian incursion would meet massive Ukrainian resistance. “There are currently enough Russian forces on the borders to launch a swift attack and inflict significant losses. But there are not enough forces to win,” Serhii Kuzan, chair of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, said. Ukraine had 261,000 troops and 400,000 military veterans, as well as surface to air missiles and new antitank weapons delivered this week by the UK, he pointed out. It has mined the coast along the sea of Azov and installed anti-ship missiles. A Russian amphibious landing would incur huge losses, he said. Amid this grim martial backdrop, Chonhar is for the moment a peaceful wildlife haven. No hunting is allowed. Its wetlands are home to growing numbers of ducks, hares, rabbits and pheasants, seen clattering amid reeds and tall yellow feather grass. “When I got here 5am I saw a fox,” Chekman said. For locals, Russia’s 2014 Crimea takeover has been a disaster. Chonhar was once a stop on the railway line to Sevastopol, with thousands of holidaymakers crossing by car in high season every day. Next to the cafe is a crumbling Soviet gateway. One pillar remains, adorned with grapes. “This place is now a tupik, a dead end,” Vyacheslav said, standing at what was once the village’s thriving roadside fish market. With no tourists, and little vehicle traffic of any kind, business was slack, he said. Vyacheslav was selling silvery roach, large smoked white-fish and mullet, which he had caught himself. His neighbour Valery, a coffee seller, said times were better in the Soviet Union – an entity Putin seems determined to bring back. “You could buy kolbasa [sausage] for eight roubles,” Valery said. A Russian land-grab of Kherson province would solve Crimea’s most pressing problem: a lack of water. A Soviet-built 400km long canal network used to connect the Dnipro river with the peninsula, supplying residents and irrigating fields. In 2014 Ukraine built a dam to stop its flow. In 2021 Crimea suffered severe drought. Defending the canal is now a strategic priority for Ukraine. A single Ukrainian soldier was visible last week where the canal begins, outside the city of Khakova. He had a Kalashnikov and an alsatian dog. Snow had blanketed the frozen waterway and its picturesque willows. At the Chonar crossing point soldiers sleep in a cosy barracks warmed by a log stove. They rejected Putin’s recent assertion that Ukraine and Russian are “one people”. “We are moving to Europe and Nato. Russia is stuck in the Soviet past,” Lt Petro Yanchenko said. Why was he fighting? “So my family can live in a free country,” he replied. Yanchenko said Crimea and the part-Russian occupied Donbas region belonged to Ukraine. He added that Kyiv had unresolved territorial claims of its own. Russia’s southern Kuban area – just across from Crimea’s Kerch strait – was once home to Ukrainian Cossacks, he said. “It’s our territory,” he asserted. The prospect of Crimea ever returning to Ukraine seems remote. But Chekman noted that the peninsula had changed hands on numerous occasions. Its bloody history is never far away. Chonhar has a needle-like memorial to Soviet dead from the second world war. On the Russia side is a monument to anti-aircraft gunners. Nazi Germany swept through the village in the summer of 1941, killing some of its Jewish residents and occupying Crimea for two years. The Red army drove the Wehrmacht out and restored Ukraine as a USSR republic. Putin appears to regard Ukraine’s independence and statehood in 1991, and its western aspirations today, as a historic error. But he may find bringing the country back under Moscow’s imperial grip is not easy as it seems. “Russia can’t do any more than threaten us,” Alex Lunyov – a sergeant in the marine corps – said. “This is our house, our home. Our grandfathers and ancestors are buried here. If the Russians come we will fight. We will kill them like cattle.” Lunyov said the Ukrainian army was tougher, more professional and better trained than in 2014, when superior Russian forces inflicted heavy defeats in the east, including a massacre in the city of Ilovaisk. “Since then we have learned how to fight,” he pointed out, saying Ukraine had right on its side. He grinned. And added with a twinkle: “A warrior’s armour is heavier than a collar of a slave.”",News/World news,‘We are ready for whatever comes’: on the Ukraine frontline,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/we-are-ready-for-whatever-comes-on-the-ukraine-frontline

Tofu often comes in large blocks that can be hard to get through in one sitting. Firm tofu freezes well – some say it even improves the texture, turning it more meat-like. Silken tofu, however, tends to get coarser when frozen, though it’s still fine to eat. If you have an excess of tofu, use it up in a quick stir-fry, add it to smoothies, whizz it up with olive oil and lemon juice to make vegan mayo, or make this quick and tasty brunch.  When I lived in Honduras, my go-to-breakfast was huevos rancheros, a spicy and satisfying brunch of eggs served on corn tortillas with salsa fresca, refried beans and guacamole. Here, I’ve made it with silken tofu, which scrambles perfectly and goes wonderfully well with the spicy rancheros sauce. It’s quick to make and a great use of excess tofu. If you like, use fresh jalapeños instead of the dried chillies here – how many depends on your taste and capacity for heat. That said, there are an estimated 4,000 different varieties of chilli now grown in the world, and exploring that diversity helps to promote biodiversity. Although seed diversity is dwindling overall, the agrodiversity of some plant species is increasing as horticulturalists explore new varieties of ingredients. In chillies’ case, these range from the very mild, pop-them-in-your-mouth varieties such as the Spanish poblano or smoky ancho, to the hottest, touch even just the tip of your tongue and blow-your-head-off varieties such as the Carolina reaper, which registers a scorching 2,200,000 on the Scoville heat scale. Keep an eye out for locally grown varieties at farmers’ markets and in box schemes, or check out the likes of theSouth Devon Chilli Farm for mail order. Dried chillies such as guajillo and chipotle can be bought from large supermarkets, delis and online.

1/22/2022,"Finally, a winter’s day that actually feels like one! Crisp air, blue sky, frost – just what the doctor ordered. For months, it has felt as if the Earth itself has been suffering from a low-grade fever – it was a depressingly record-breaking 16C on New Year’s Day and has been grumbling along in low double figures ever since. Today, though, the icy air quickens the blood, tautens everything with its astringent sting. I want to feel it against my skin, as you might test a knife’s sharpness with your thumb. At Staple Hill, the footpath skirts the edge of conifer plantations: mostly Scots pine, Norway spruce and the occasional magnificent cedar. There are also oaks, beech and silver birch, and under the trees a tussocky jumble of bracken, moss and brambles. The whole area is a delightful patchwork of evergreen and deciduous, straight rows and rambling woodland, tarmacked pathways and animal tracks, open glades and spooky fairytale forests where a gruffalo would feel right at home.  The tree trunks look painted in colours squeezed fresh from the tube. A trick of the eye? Surely this much iridescent green belongs in the summer and in the leaves of the canopy, not on the trunks and branches of the naked trees? Lichen reigns supreme at this time of year, in every shade of jade, emerald, pistachio and chartreuse. Each variety is the result of a particular blend of fungus, bacteria and algae. The sun has been out all day, but in the dips and shadows, frost still lingers. Tiny white globules adorn each blade of grass. I pick one up expecting it to crumble, deliquesce or pop, but it stays on the tip of my finger: a pearl of solid water, supercooled dew. I put it in my mouth and it melts deliciously on my tongue. I cross a glade of plantation trees, their tall shadows spreading on the grass as precise as a barcode, and enter the forest. Fallen pine needles cushion the ground, putting a spring in my step. The air is drenched with phytoncides. I can almost feel my immune system bucking up. My walk back is a slow strobe – two steps dark, two steps dazzle – as though the sun has decided this perfect crystal day deserves nothing less than to end in a blaze of glory.

1/22/2022,"Late last year, Pablo Ortez quit his job, sold his belongings and prepared to join his wife in Japan, where she is studying for a doctorate. But 72 hours before he was due to leave Argentina, he checked the Japanese foreign ministry website to find that the government had imposed a near-blanket travel ban to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus.  “I called the Japanese embassy and they said I couldn’t fly,” said Ortez, who has moved in with his mother and does not know when he will be able to join his wife, whom he has not seen since she visited Argentina last April. The 33-year-old is one of tens of thousands of people with plans to study, work or join relatives in Japan who now find themselves “locked out” of a country that has maintained some of the world’s strictest travel restrictions throughout the pandemic. The latest measures, imposed at the end of November, apply to all arrivals except Japanese citizens and returning foreign residents – new students, guest workers, technical interns and, in some cases, the foreign spouses and children of Japanese nationals. Lewis Hussey had set his heart on studying in Japan before he graduates from university this summer. But the travel ban means the Missouri-based student has had to drastically rethink his plans. “It’s incredibly disappointing,” Hussey, 26, said. “There have been times when it looked like Japan was about to open up, and then it didn’t. It’s frustrating because I could have considered other places. I feel like I’ve been cheated out of the opportunity to study abroad because of the inconsistent and nonsensical approach of the Japanese government.” The World Health Organization has urged countries not to impose blanket travel bans, warning that they were ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus and created economic and social misery. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, is unlikely to make significant changes to the border policy, however, after a recent poll showed 88% of the public believed the measure was “appropriate”. But it has not prevented Omicron from taking hold in Japan, which reported a record 46,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday. This weekend, large parts of the country, including Tokyo, will enter a quasi-state of emergency to relieve pressure on health services. Japan has imposed tight travel restrictions throughout the pandemic, with moves to relax them quickly undone by waves of infections driven by new variants. The only exception came last summer, when tens of thousands of athletes, officials and journalists arrived for the Tokyo Olympics. Aware of how mismanagement of the pandemic helped topple his predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, Kishida is hoping that travel restrictions will play well among voters during upper house elections in July. Kishida recently said the ban would be extended until the end of February, but Jade Barry is bracing herself for more delays. The 29-year-old was poised to fulfil her professional ambition of expanding her hairpiece business when the latest ban went into effect, forcing her to drop plans to scout locations in Tokyo for her new outlet. “I was devastated,” Barry said from her home near Chicago. “I cried all day and my kids were wondering what was wrong with mom. “I have been in love with Japan since I was little. Expanding my business there was a way of realising my ultimate goal of starting a life there. I still believe it’s a beautiful country, but to be banned for so long means I feel resentment towards the government.” Stranded students have found little sympathy among Japanese politicians but have received support from some business leaders, who say the ban will stifle innovation and threaten Japan’s long-term interests as more students look to other countries, including economic rivals such as South Korea. Hiroshi Mikitani, chief executive of the e-commerce group Rakuten, has likened the ban to the isolation brought by the sakoku “locked country” policy during the Edo period (1603-1868). On the day Kishida extended the restrictions, Mikitani tweeted: “What is the point of not letting in new foreigners now? Do you want to shut Japan off from the rest of the world?” A letter to Kishida signed this week by hundreds of academics and experts in Japan-US studies, urged his government to relax border controls to allow educators, students and scholars to enter Japan. “They become the bridges between Japan and other societies. They are future policymakers, business leaders and teachers,” the letter said. “They are the foundation of the US-Japan alliance and other international relationships that support Japan’s core national interests. The closure is harming Japan’s national interests and international relationships.” “It’s frustrating,” said Imane, a 20-year-old Canadian student who has waited two years to begin her Japanese-language studies in Tokyo. “It’s been two years of wasting time, waiting for Japan to open its borders. “I love Japan so this is heartbreaking, but I can’t spend my whole life waiting,” added Imane, who preferred to use only her first name. “If Japan doesn’t open its borders this year I’m going to have to look elsewhere.” Her frustrations are shared by Vilhelm, a student from Lithuania, who gets up at 4.30am for online classes in international business studies at a university in Tokyo. “The most frustrating part is that I can see no end to this,” said Vilhelm, who asked that his surname not be used. “I’ve invested in studying in Japan and I feel like it is treating me very unfairly. I still love Japan, but sometimes I forget why.” Barry took to social media to rally students and other stranded people behind a campaign to end the restrictions, with protests outside Japanese embassies planned for later this month. “To have the opportunity to come to Japan ripped away is devastating. And I can’t imagine what it’s like not to be able to see your child because of border restrictions. The uncertainty is no longer acceptable. This is literally ruining people’s lives.” The government responded to mounting criticism by opening the door, if only by a fraction. It will allow 87 students on government scholarships to enter in February, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said last week. But that leaves almost 150,000 others, mostly privately funded, who have been waiting up to two years to begin their studies. They will continue to live in limbo, unsure of when they will be able to begin their new lives in a country that has effectively become a Covid hermit kingdom. “Japan is damaging its soft power and its economy because it is punishing people who have a genuine interest in the country,” Ortez said. “It’s ruining its reputation. This will have long-term consequences for Japan.”",News/World news,‘I cried all day’: the anguish of people locked out of Japan by Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/i-cried-all-day-the-anguish-of-people-locked-out-of-japan-by-covid
