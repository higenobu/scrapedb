12/28/2021,"BEIJING (AP) — To help make China a self-reliant “technology superpower,” the ruling Communist Party is pushing the world's biggest e-commerce company to take on the tricky, expensive business of designing its own processor chips — a business unlike anything Alibaba Group has done before. Its 3-year-old chip unit, T-Head, unveiled its third processor in October, the Yitian 710 for Alibaba's cloud computing business. Alibaba says for now, it has no plans to sell the chip to outsiders. Other rookie chip developers including Tencent, a games and social media giant, and smartphone brand Xiaomi are pledging billions of dollars in line with official plans to create computing, clean energy and other technology that can build China’s wealth and global influence. Processor chips play an increasingly critical role in products from smartphones and cars to medical devices and home appliances. Shortages due to the coronavirus pandemic are disrupting global manufacturing and adding to worries about supplies. Chips are a top priority in the ruling Communist Party's marathon campaign to end China's reliance on technology from the United States, Japan and other suppliers Beijing sees as potential economic and strategic rivals. If it succeeds, business and political leaders warn that might slow down innovation, disrupt global trade and make the world poorer. “Self-reliance is the foundation for the Chinese nation,” President Xi Jinping said in a speech released in March. He called for China to become a “technology superpower” to safeguard “national economic security.” “We must strive to become the world’s main center of science and the high ground of innovation,” Xi said. Beijing might be chasing a costly disappointment. Even with huge official investments, businesspeople and analysts say chipmakers and other companies will struggle to compete if they detach from global suppliers of advanced components and technology — a goal no other country is pursuing. “It’s hard to imagine any one country rebuilding all of that and having the best technology,” said Peter Hanbury, who follows the industry for Bain & Co. Beijing’s campaign is adding to tension with Washington and Europe, which see China as a strategic competitor and complain it steals technology. They limit access to tools needed to improve its industries. If the world were to decouple, or split into markets with incompatible standards and products, U.S.- or European-made parts might not work in Chinese computers or cars. Smartphone makers who have a single dominant global operating system and two network standards might need to make unique versions for different markets. That could slow down development. Washington and Beijing need to “avoid that the world becomes separated,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told The Associated Press in September. China's factories assemble the world’s smartphones and tablet computers but need components from the United States, Europe, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Chips are China’s biggest import, ahead of crude oil, at more than $300 billion last year. Official urgency over that grew after Huawei Technologies Ltd., China’s first global tech brand, lost access to U.S. chips and other technology in 2018 under sanctions imposed by the White House. That crippled the telecom equipment maker’s ambition to be a leader in next-generation smartphones. American officials say Huawei is a security risk and might aid Chinese spying, an accusation the company denies. Huawei and some Chinese rivals are close to matching Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc., South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and Britain’s Arm Ltd. at being able to design “bleeding edge” logic chips for smartphones, according to industry analysts. But when it comes to making them, foundries such as state-owned SMIC in Shanghai are up to a decade behind industry leaders including TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., which produces chips for Apple Inc. and other global brands. Even companies such as Alibaba that can design chips likely will need Taiwanese or other foreign foundries to make them. Alibaba's Yitian 710 requires precision no Chinese foundry can achieve. The company declined to say which foreign producer it will use. “My country still faces a big gap in chip technology,” said industry analyst Liu Chuntian of Zero Power Intelligence Group. China accounts for 23% of global chip production capacity but only 7.6% of sales. Packing millions of transistors onto a fingernail-size sliver of silicon requires some 1,500 steps, microscopic precision and arcane technologies owned by a handful of U.S., European, Japanese and other suppliers. They include KLA Corp. in California for super-precise measurement and Japan’s TEL for machines to apply coatings a few molecules thick. Many are covered by restrictions on “dual use” technologies that can be used in weapons. China “lags significantly” in tools, materials and production technology, the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a report this year. Washington and Europe, citing security worries, block access to the most advanced tools Chinese chipmakers need to match global leaders in precision and efficiency. Without those, China is falling farther behind, said Bain’s Hanbury. “The TSMC horse is sprinting away and the Chinese horse is stopped,” he said. “They can’t move forward.” Washington stepped up pressure on Huawei last year by barring global foundries from using American technology to produce its chips. U.S. vendors can sell chips to the company, but not for next-generation “5G” smartphones. For its part, the European Union said it will review foreign investments after complaints China was eroding Europe’s technology lead by purchasing important assets such as German robot maker Kuka. Alibaba’s Yitian 710 is based on architecture from Britain’s Arm, highlighting China’s enduring need for foreign know-how. Alibaba said it still will work closely with longtime foreign suppliers Intel, Arm, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. T-Head’s first chip, the Hanguang 800, was announced in 2019 for artificial intelligence. Its second, the XuanTie 910, is for self-driving cars and other functions. In November, Tencent Holding, which operates the WeChat messaging service, announced its first three chips for artificial intelligence, cloud computing and video. Beijing says it will spend $150 billion from 2014 through 2030 to develop its chip industry, but even that is a fraction of what global leaders invest. TSMC plans to spend $100 billion in the next three years on research and manufacturing. China is trying to buy experience by hiring engineers from TSMC and other Taiwanese producers. Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory and has threatened to attack, has responded by imposing curbs on job advertising. Beijing encourages smartphone and other manufacturers to use suppliers within China, even if they cost more, but officials deny China wants to detach from global industries. “We will never go back in history by seeking to decouple,” Xi said in a speech by video link to a November meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia. The latest conflict is over photolithography, which uses ultraviolet light to etch circuits into silicon on a scale measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter. The leader is ASML in the Netherlands, which makes machines that can etch transistors just 5 nanometers apart. That would pack 2 million into a space one centimeter wide. China’s SMIC is about one-third as precise at 14 nanometers. Taiwan’s TSMC is preparing to increase its precision to 2 nanometers. SMIC wants to upgrade by purchasing ASML’s latest machine, but the Dutch government has yet to agree. “We will wait for their decision,” said an ASML spokeswoman, Monica Mols, in an email. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing and AP Writer Edith M.

12/28/2021,"One of the most restrictive death rows in the country lets inmates listen to the prison-run radio station. ""The Tank has helped me,"" John Henry Ramirez, an inmate on death row, said of the station. Ramirez was convicted for a 2004 killing, and the Supreme Court has stayed his execution. Death row inmate John Henry Ramirez said the prisoner-run radio station at a Texas prison helps get him through his time in solitary confinement, according to a report by The Marshall Project via The Guardian. The Allan B. Polunsky Unit — described as ""one of the most restrictive death rows in the country,"" according to The Marshall Project — under normal circumstances does not allow inmates to communicate with each other, but the radio station is the exception. ""You just don't know if you exist anymore,"" Ramy Hozaifeh, an inmate radio host, said, according to The Marshall Project. ""It just kind of removes your humanity from you, and I think the radio has put that back in the equation."" Since August 2020, the radio station, 106.5 FM The Tank, can be heard across the prison. The station airs the audio of sitcom episodes like ""Sanford and Son"" and ""Martin."" It also plays music and reads written works from inmates, The Guardian reported. He remains on death row and looks to the prison radio station for solace. ""I don't know if y'all really understand how big that is because y'all in GP [general population],"" he told the other prisoners at a special outdoor church service before he was scheduled to be executed. ""Look at how y'all all next to each other. Y'all posted up, y'all walking around, y'all touching each other. We ain't got none of that. Y'all got community. We alone, we all by ourselves."" ""The Tank has helped me. The Tank has given me an avenue to do that,"" Ramirez continued. The Court granted a stay the night of his scheduled execution on September 8, a court document shows. Ramirez said he wanted his spiritual adviser, Pastor Dana Moore, to hold his hand and pray over him during his execution, and the Supreme Court has until June 2022 to decide Ramirez's fate, according to an email from his attorney, Seth Kretzer. ""The State makes no effort to hide its disrespect for the religious exercise of death-row inmates like petitioner who seek spiritual comfort in their final moments,"" Kretzer said in a brief. ""It views condemned inmates only as nuisances who 'piggyback on one another's lawsuits to make ever-increasing demands on the State.'"" Ramirez, now 37-years-old, was convicted for the 2004 killing of Pablo Castro during a robbery and sentenced to capital punishment nearly four years later, according to The Washington Post. According to Texas Monthly, Ramirez was under the influence of cocaine, marijuana, and vodka, and looking for someone to rob so he could buy more substances. ""I was a horrible person — horrible,"" Ramirez said at the outdoor church service. ""But I made the effort to do the best I could and to live my life the best I could once I realized how horrible I was."" He added: ""If I do gotta walk there, I can walk there in peace knowing I did as much good as I could. It ain't never gonna make up for what I did.""

12/28/2021,"Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas thanked President Biden during a Monday conference call. The GOP leader applauded the president's efforts to ""depoliticize"" the response to COVID-19. On the call, Biden addressed governors' concerns about rapid testing shortages in hard-hit states. Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas reached across the symbolic aisle on Monday to thank President Joe Biden for his efforts to ""depoliticize"" the country's COVID-19 response amid the raging Omicron variant. The Republican leader made the comments during a conference call held by the Biden administration with the governors of several states to discuss the national response to the worrisome Omicron variant, which has sparked a spike in cases across the country in recent days and prompted testing shortages and delays. ""I want to thank all of the White House team for being such great support to the governors,"" Hutchinson said during his opening remarks, according to The Hill. ""And I want to thank [you], Mr. President, [for] your address to the nation last week. Thank you for your comments designed to depoliticize our COVID response. I think that was helpful."" Last week, Biden outlined additional steps his administration is taking to fight the Omicron variant in a national address. In addition to offering a ""stark warning"" to the unvaccinated, Biden also offered a rare point of praise to his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. ""Thanks to the prior administration and our scientific community, America is one of the first countries to get the vaccine,"" Biden said during his speech from the White House last Tuesday. ""And thanks to my administration and the hard work of Americans, we led a rollout that made America among the world leaders in getting shots in arms."" During the speech, Biden also applauded Trump's announcement that he'd received a booster shot. On Monday's conference call, Biden and his White House COVID-19 response team attempted to ease worried governors who decried long testing lines and rapid test shortages in several states where Omicron has exploded. After thanking the president for his previous comments about increasing the supply chain on rapid COVID-19 tests, Hutchinson, who serves as chair of the National Governors Association, also warned federal officials that the government's plan to buy and distribute 500 million free rapid tests could impede states' attempts to boost supply on an individual level. ""Make sure that we do not let federal solutions stand in the way of state solutions,"" Hutchinson said, according to Politico. On the call, Biden discussed his administration's efforts to improve testing availability by highlighting the proposed purchase of 500 million tests, as well as an additional plan that will require private insurers to reimburse at-home test purchases. The meeting came as the US averages more than 200,000 cases per day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a matter of weeks during December, the Omicron variant has prompted the nation's largest surge in cases since last winter's peak. Biden ended Monday's call with a note of positivity, telling the governors that Omicron is a source of concern, but not cause for panic, and assured listeners that the federal government is equipped to help states deal with surges.
