5/11/2022,"Good morning. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will face off again in a third and final leaders’ debate tonight, just 10 days out from the election. Here’s hoping the pair will provide more clarity about their party’s policies, after the calamity of Sunday’s second debate. Material circulating on the Chinese language social media platform WeChat alleges Labor and the Greens will fund school programs to turn students gay, impose new taxes and destroy Chinese wealth. The well-produced posters designed for the digital platform carry no authorisation, but mostly support the Liberal party. With three million users across the country, including politicians and media, the network could play a pivotal role in determining who wins. Here’s what we know about how the campaign is playing out on the platform so far. The Australian Electoral Commission is “actively” investigating unauthorised political signs claiming independent candidates are affiliated with the Greens, and whether they breach laws that ban misleading voters after confirming they break electoral laws requiring authorisation. Meanwhile, the AEC asked social networks to remove a video from Pauline Hanson’s campaign that includes allegations of voter fraud in past federal elections, but not before it got at least 200,000 views. Guardian Australia reporter Antoun Issa goes through Hanson’s claims one at a time and checks the facts. Most prominent independent candidates say they would negotiate with either Labor or the Liberals in the event of a hung parliament, with many indicating they would support whichever party met their policy demands on climate and integrity. The two issues were repeatedly cited as the most commonly raised in the respective electorates of the dozen high-profile lower house independent candidates and sitting crossbench MPs questioned by Guardian Australia. Curious to know more? Read the full responses from independent candidates and crossbench MPs surveyed. Vladimir Putin could potentially use a nuclear weapon if he views the prospect of defeat in Ukraine as an existential threat to his regime, the top US intelligence official has warned. The grim forecast came on a day of continued fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, and Russian missile attacks on the port of Odesa, with the UN conceding that the civilian death toll from the war will probably be far higher than the current official estimate of 3,381. Coral bleaching affected more than 90% of reefs surveyed along the Great Barrier Reef this year according to a report, which revealed the extent of the sixth mass bleaching event. Ride-share and taxi drivers say the rising cost of petrol is putting them under enormous strain. Drivers say their costs have surged but fares have stayed flat, forcing them to be picky about the trips they choose. Domestic violence advocates and survivors have welcomed an inquiry into how Queensland police handle domestic violence, but are waiting for the detail to see if it will examine “widespread cultural issues” within the police service. Employers have warned that “small business can’t afford” the 5.1% minimum wage rise backed by Anthony Albanese to keep up with inflation. Employers argue that excessive minimum pay increases will fuel inflation, but unions say a 5.5% increase is “incredibly reasonable” to meet cost-of-living pressures. People in National party seats will be turned off by Bridget McKenzie’s characterisation of community independents as “Simon Holmes à Court’s groupies”, the former Indi independent Cathy McGowan has warned. The Spanish spy chief, Paz Esteban, has been sacked as the country tries to contain the fallout from a cyber-espionage scandal. Survivors of the brutal regime of the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos have described his son’s apparent landslide presidential election victory as the product of trickery and disinformation. Elon Musk has said he will reverse Twitter’s ban on Donald Trump if he completes a takeover of the social media platform. China’s zero-Covid policy is not sustainable “considering the behaviour of the virus”, according to the WHO. Natalie Bassingthwaighte’s latest TV project is, by her own description, a “heartwarming experiment” in which seven strangers see if increased creativity can help their mental health. Despite her years on stage, Bassingthwaighte didn’t grow up in a musical household – or so she thought. It wasn’t until she unearthed an old keyboard from her parent’s home that she learned her dad had once played music. She tells us why she’d rush to save that “crusty” old instrument in a fire. Australia relies on overseas-trained medical experts yet consigns them to professional purgatory, writes Ranjana Srivastava. “On my way to a conference, the taxi driver has taken an inordinate interest in my work until I am forced to reveal that I am an oncologist … it never crosses my mind that he might be a doctor himself. The disclosure [that he was a cancer surgeon before a taxi driver] makes me sink deeper into my seat to render myself invisible. He fled his country during war. When he turned his mind to medicine, the hurdles were onerous and the rules opaque.” An intimate new documentary explores the difficult life of David McComb of the Triffids, one of Australia’s most brilliant songwriters, whose unexpected death stunned the industry. Jonathan Alley began working on his biopic Love in Bright Landscapes 13 years ago. He wanted to celebrate McComb’s incendiary talent for words and music, but didn’t want it to be a standard rock documentary. “I wanted to make a biographical piece on an artist and what was happening in that person’s life, and why those things were happening,” he says. In Queensland, a big swing away from the Labor party in 2019 was a decisive factor in their defeat. However, the political landscape in some seats has shifted. In today’s Full Story, Guardian Australia’s Queensland correspondent Ben Smee talks to voters in metropolitan and regional areas about what will decide their vote, and speaks to Laura Murphy-Oates about how an unpredictable climate of change in the state could affect the election.

5/11/2022,"Finn Russell believes the jeopardy of relegation in the Top 14 is a key factor behind the success of the French clubs in the Champions Cup with Racing 92 one of three to reach the last four, which features no Premiership teams for the second year running. Russell scored a remarkable try in Racing’s victory over Sale last Sunday to ensure a rematch of last season’s semi-final against La Rochelle, on Sunday, while Leinster host Toulouse, the defending champions, in the other tie on Saturday. Sale’s defeat leaves no English clubs in the reckoning in a tournament that was won by a Premiership side for four of the five seasons before the current lean spell began. Racing’s side featured Russell, Teddy Thomas and Juan Imhoff while they were able to call on Virimi Vakatawa and the World Cup-winning prop Trevor Nyakane from the bench in a show of their strength in depth. While the salary cap in France has recently been reduced, it sits at around €10m (£8.5m), significantly more than the Premiership, which has been trimmed to £5m. Furthermore, there will be dispensation for one marquee player to sit outside the cap, rather than two, from next season. That has led to a number of high-profile players leaving the Premiership – Sale are losing the World Cup winners Faf de Klerk and Lood de Jager – and though the fact there is no relegation for this season, the next and possibly longer dilutes the need for such star power on a domestic front, it could be hurting the Premiership’s chances in Europe. “The number of players we have here in France and the recruitment we do, that helps a lot,” said Russell. “In the Premiership just now, there’s no relegation. Over here, teams are scrapping to stay out of that relegation battle – scrapping to stay up, or get into the Champions Cup. Mike Davis, the coach who guided England to a triumphant 1980 Six Nations grand slam, has died at the age of 80. Davis, who also won 16 caps for his country, was in charge of the national team for four years between 1979 and 1983 and was widely respected across the game. England had not won a grand slam since 1957 when Davis took over as head coach for the 1979-80 season but, under the captaincy of Bill Beaumont, his side clinched a famous clean sweep with a 30-18 victory over Scotland at Murrayfield. Overall Davis’s 20 Tests in charge yielded 10 wins and three draws. Davis played his club rugby for Torquay Athletic and Harlequins and made his international debut at lock against Wales in Cardiff in 1963. His played his final Test against Scotland in 1970 before becoming a popular, long-serving teacher at Sherborne School in Dorset. “There are never any easy games. Every game, you have to play your best to win. This year, we’ve lost to Biarritz and Perpignan, who are at the bottom of the league. We lost to both of them away from home. “That just shows that whether teams are high up or low down, every game is a massive game. Every week you are playing in a must-win game because if you drop two points, it puts you in a tough position. That’s the great thing for us. “I don’t really keep an eye on how the league is going in England. I just know that, over here, where there is relegation, teams are scrapping at the bottom because they want to stay in the Top 14. Whether they are at home or away, it makes games so much harder because teams are scrapping away to stay in the Top 14.” Russell also believes the success of the Top 14 sides on the continent goes hand in hand with the fortunes of the France national side, who clinched a first Six Nations grand slam in 12 years in March. “In general, French rugby is getting much better and it’s a country that loves rugby so with the clubs and the national team doing that, it gets more and more people into rugby. “It’s different – the Top 14 compared to the Premiership or the URC. The style of rugby changes from team to team, but also from competition to competition. In the Top 14 there’s physicality, there’s flair, there’s strategy; there’s everything you want here.”",Sport/Sport,Russell highlights relegation scrap as spark for Top 14 clubs’ success in Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/finn-russell-claims-relegation-threat-helps-strengthen-top-14-clubs-in-europe
5/11/2022,"Vanuatu’s push for the international court of justice to protect vulnerable nations from climate change has received the backing of 1,500 civil society organisations from more than 130 countries, as it heads toward a crucial vote at the UN General Assembly later this year. In 2021 Vanuatu announced its intention to seek an advisory opinion by the international court of justice on the rights of present and future generations to be protected from climate change. If it succeeds, the ICJ’s advisory opinion - although non-binding - carries legal weight and moral authority which experts say could help shape international law. The opinion could also influence domestic and regional courts and tribunals when addressing issues relating to climate change. Vanuatu is trying to build support for its motion ahead of the UN General Assembly later this year, at which it needs to secure at least 97 votes, in order for the matter to be referred to the ICJ. The alliance, announced on Friday, represents more than 1,500 civil society organisations (CSOs) from across the globe, including preeminent climate groups from the Pacific: Climate Action Network - International, Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Oxfam in the Pacific, 350 Pacific, Pacific Islands Climate Action Network and Vanuatu Climate Action Network. An independent observer of Vanuatu’s campaign said the alliance could put pressure on other nations to support Vanuatu’s initiative. “It throws the weight of these CSOs behind the initiative, which will put pressure on other states to support the initiative. There have been similar proposals before, which have been driven by other Pacific countries, like Palau in 2011, which have been derailed by pressure from rich countries, such as the United States,” said Fleur Ramsay, a Pacific islander lawyer specialising in climate and environmental law with the Environmental Defenders Office. Vanuatu has engaged a Pacific law firm, Blue Ocean Law, to represent them in their campaign for the advisory opinion and has retained external counsel to assist with the development of the legal strategy, including lawyers from the UK, the US, France, Canada, Greece, India, Switzerland and Fiji. Joseph Sikulu, Pacific Director of 350.org said the alliance was an extension of the important advocacy Pacific island nations have been doing on climate change for many years. “The Pacific has already shown that governments and civil society can work together to achieve impactful change; the 1.5 degree benchmark being ingrained into the Paris Agreement is a testament to that. Through this alliance we hope to continue to weave together advocacy at all levels to build momentum behind the Vanuatu Government’s push for this Advisory Opinion.” Vanuatu is one of the countries most affected by the climate crisis, with a combination of climate risks that include sea level and temperature rises, as well as extreme weather events including cyclones, storm surges, landslides, flooding and droughts. It is also among Pacific nations at the forefront of the climate fight. Vanuatu has been a vocal proponent in limiting temperature rise from global warming to 1.5C. The Pacific nation launched an online data modelling tool to perceive and prepare for potential impacts of rising tides and storm surges. It is are also experimenting with crossbreed crop varieties to identify climate resilient crops including taro. Vanuatu ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016 and is one of 43 nations on the Climate Vulnerable Forum. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, Vanuatu prime minister Bob Loughman said: “The dire consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored, and the science linking climate change to past and present emissions of greenhouse gases is now beyond question. Climate change is driving sea level rise, desertification, disease redistribution, floods, unprecedented ‘heat domes’, cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events.”",News/World news,Vanuatu’s push for legal protection from climate change wins crucial support,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/vanuatus-push-for-legal-protection-from-climate-change-wins-crucial-support
5/11/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article includes details of the final episode of Life After Life. Do not read on unless you have watched the first three episodes. Groundhog Day stories are always tense. No one wants to spend their life reliving the same day over and over, whether it be Amazon Prime’s Palm Springs movie’s tale of waking up at a friend’s wedding every morning (please God, no) or endlessly replaying your birthday party, as in season one of Netflix’s Russian Doll, before Nadia’s time travel became a tad more freeform. These time-loop tales conjure intense discomfort, paranoia and irritation – you can’t help but go all existential and ponder: “What even is time? What the hell is life?” Life After Life is a period drama that pushes this time-loop narrative to the next level, in which the protagonist, Ursula Todd, relives her life again and again and again. While this concept has the potential to be one long exhausting slog (for the audience and Ursula), the series – which concludes its neat four-episode run on BBC Two tonight – has turned out to be one of the most beautifully told, thoughtful and underrated series of the year so far. Based on Kate Atkinson’s 2013 novel, it begins with Ursula’s birth in rural Buckinghamshire in 1910. Within seconds, she is strangled by her umbilical cord and dies. The screen is covered in snow-like white flecks to mark her death, and the story immediately rewinds to her birth – only this time, a doctor is there to save baby Ursula. She grows up to become a young girl, but when she goes swimming in the sea, those white flecks fall, and we are taken back to her birth. It quickly becomes clear that Ursula is both horribly accident-prone and downright unlucky. With each life iteration, she reaches different ages, but she always dies – the 1918 flu pandemic, falling out of a window, second world war bombings – and is reborn to start all over again. Unlike most other time-loop narratives, Ursula isn’t fully aware that she lives life after life. She isn’t tormented by her former lives. She’s also not trying to escape her life, or the loop she is unknowingly caught in. Instead, she lets a powerful sense of deja vu guide her into making different decisions that usually, but not always, lead to a happier and more learned place. The more times she lives, the better and bolder she is at it, and we are treated to a different story – a different woman! – in each one. Thomasin Mckenzie, who plays Ursula, is perfect at capturing this gradual change from meekly dreading life to brazenly embracing her gut feelings and taking new chances. Despite this, though, many of Ursula’s lives are miserable. In fact, with the knowledge that she will always get another chance to improve things, it sometimes comes as a relief when she dies. The hardest life to watch is the one in which Ursula is raped as a teenager and has a secret abortion. When her mother (Sian Clifford, wonderful in a genre we’ve not seen her in before) finds out, their relationship becomes permanently tainted with shame. Ursula moves to London, turns to drinking and ends up marrying a man who lies about his debts and abuses her. It’s hard to think of another period drama that unflinchingly shows the brutal realities of assault, abortion and domestic violence as powerfully and non-gratuitously – putting the focus on to something that too many women have died from, including Ursula. Her next life – in which she dodges those who previously assaulted her, and goes on to exercise her sexual freedom – provides great satisfaction. After already living around 10 lives, it’s actually comforting to see her live again. Of course, she soon dies. But the following lives after this see her apply to the University of Oxford, fall in love and have a child with a good man, learn how to shoot a gun … you name it, she’s done it. It’s also a hoot to see her befriend Izzie (Jessica Brown Findlay), the wild but loving and loyal aunt who parties in London and writes a column called Adventures of a Modern Spinster. In every life Ursula lives, their friendship remains.The one other constant in all her lives is the second world war, which much of the final episode concentrates on. This is when those existential questions creep in. “I don’t know why we live. All we do is die,” Ursula sobs before breathing her last under the rubble. “I just want a good death. How do you have a good death?” Why is any of this happening? Is she meant to prevent the war? Will she only be at peace with a happy death? Is she meant to save her brother Teddy, who keeps getting shot down? Is this all a dream? It’s clear there are no answers. No box-packaged ending explains it. There’s no riddle for Ursula to solve to stop the time-loop, no mission she’s meant to complete (she shoots Hitler in one life, but she dies at the same time, so we don’t know if she was successful or not – not that it matters, anyway, if she is born once again into a world in which Hitler exists). There is no “happy death”, either – otherwise she wouldn’t return even after she dies on a beach as an old woman. There is unexpected peace in this ambiguity. After the last scene, Ursula is still being born and dying, being born and dying, being born and dying. Far from being a frustrating story of someone stuck in a cycle, it’s a whole library of great stories that one person has the potential to live.

5/11/2022,"Federal agents and detectives from the Madison police department are investigating a claim by a pro-choice group that it was behind a weekend arson attack on an anti-abortion office in Wisconsin. The headquarters of Wisconsin Family Action in Madison was attacked in the early hours of Sunday, with a molotov cocktail thrown through a window, starting a small fire, and graffiti spray-painted on an exterior wall. Nobody was hurt. In a statement reported on Tuesday by the Lincoln Journal Star, which said it was unable to verify the group’s authenticity, Jane’s Revenge said it launched the attack because of the organization’s anti-abortion stance, and demanded that similar institutions across the US disband or face “increasingly extreme tactics”. “Wisconsin is the first flashpoint, but we are all over the US, and we will issue no further warnings,” the statement said, citing the violence of anti-choice groups who “bomb [abortion] clinics and assassinate doctors with impunity” as justification. The Madison attack came days after the leaking of a supreme court draft ruling that would overturn its 1973 Roe v Wade decision and end almost half a century of constitutional abortion protections. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) told the Guardian that its agents were aware of the group’s claims of responsibility, but cited the ongoing investigation for being unable to give more details. The Madison police department said it was “aware of a group claiming responsibility for the arson at Wisconsin Family Action and are working with our federal partners to determine the veracity of that claim”. It urged anyone with relevant information to make contact, saying: “We take all information and tips related to this case seriously and are working to vet each and every one.” At a press conference on Monday afternoon, the Madison PD and ATF agents announced a joint investigation into what it called an “abortion extremism case involving an arson and graffiti attack of a pro-life advocacy office in Madison”. The Madison police chief, Shon Barnes, said no suspects had so far been identified. Authorities were expected to give a further update on Tuesday afternoon. In a values statement on its website, Wisconsin Family Action (WFA) describes itself as a Judeo-Christian group dedicated to “strengthening, preserving, and promoting marriage, family, life and liberty. “We support the sanctity of human life from the moment of conception through natural death. This includes opposing legislation that promotes the destruction of human life – which starts at conception – through abortion and other means,” it says. Jack Hoogendyk, the WFA board chairman, attacked the response to the attack in a tweet posted on Tuesday morning, singling out Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and Madison PD detectives. “We need to see a much stronger message of condemnation of this activity from our Governor [and] from local law enforcement,” he wrote. At a press conference on Monday, Evers called the attack “a horrible incident”. Calling for a full investigation and arrests, he added: “As the state of Wisconsin, we don’t accept that type of violence here.” An attack on an anti-abortion office is a relative rarity compared with attacks on abortion clinics and providers. In 2019, the Guardian reported on an “alarming escalation” in picketing, vandalism and trespassing by anti-abortion activists at medical facilities. Arson, bombings, murders and acid attacks were among more than 300 acts of extreme violence recorded by the Rand Corporation between 1973 and 2003, and in one of the most heinous incidents, in 2009, Dr George Tiller, a Kansas abortion provider, was shot dead in a church in Wichita. In March, MS magazine reported that the number of brick-and-mortar abortion clinics nationwide had dropped precipitously, partly because of the constant threat of violence against personnel. Six states, MS said, had only one abortion provider, mostly small, independent operators who were considered most at risk. “Abortion clinics have been closing at an alarming rate,” the article said. “Independent providers are the most vulnerable to anti-abortion attacks and violence directed at their staff.”",News/US news,Pro-choice group claims arson attack on Wisconsin anti-abortion office,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/abortion-arson-attack-wisconsin-pro-choice-janes-revenge
5/11/2022,"Boris Johnson was accused of being “bereft of ideas or purpose,” after a Queen’s speech that included 38 new bills but offered no specific measures to tackle the immediate cost of living crisis. Instead, the speech, delivered by the Prince of Wales amid the pomp of the state opening of parliament, included plans to tear up the Human Rights Act, make it harder for councils to rename streets and privatise Channel 4. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the speech showed the government had no guiding principle, while Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, was equally withering. “British politics is out of ideas,” he said. “Further action has been promised on the cost of living, but there certainly wasn’t any in the Queen’s speech. It rightly highlighted the need for growth – the essential precondition for ending our living standards stagnation – but did little to actually bring it about.” With the Queen unable to give the address for the first time in almost 60 years, Prince Charles began by saying: “My government’s priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families”. However, Johnson’s programme for the new parliamentary session included a string of well-trailed and controversial plans, including banning disruptive protests and preventing universities from no-platforming speakers; but few new policies likely to boost the economy in the short term. Instead, the government emphasised help it had already provided, including the temporary energy bill rebate and the cut to the universal credit taper rate. Government sources claimed two-thirds of the planned new laws were aimed at boosting economic growth in the medium and long-term, pointing to the energy security bill, which aims to open up the market for new technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture. Johnson said the country had “risen to challenges with no precedent in recent history” including the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout, as well as Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, the UK’s supply of weapons to Kyiv and the sanctions regime that had been imposed. But he warned that “economic aftershocks” of global crises meant huge disruptions to the global economy. “No country is immune and no government can realistically shield everyone from the impact,” he said. Responding to the speech in the House of Commons, Starmer said the government had failed to respond to the scale of the looming “stagflation crisis”, while Conservative backbenchers David Davis and John Redwood called for tax cuts. Theresa May’s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell tweeted that there was “lots to like” in the Queen’s speech, including a ban on no-fault evictions once promised by May; but he criticised the “lack of action” on the cost of living, adding, “both morally and politically the government needs to do more.” Starmer said: “We need a government of the moment, with the ideas that meet the aspirations of the people.” He claimed that instead, the government was “bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle or a roadmap for delivery”. He added: “Their time has passed.” Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: “This Queen’s speech does nothing to help the millions of families and pensioners facing soaring bills and eye watering inflation. It shows a prime minister refusing to listen to the clear message sent by voters at last week’s local elections who are fed up of being taken for granted by this Conservative government.” Away from the cost of living, the government said it would introduce measures to ban no-fault evictions and tackle rogue landlords; and give councils new powers to sell off empty high street properties, in a levelling up and regeneration bill. There were also a series of measures that appeared aimed at allowing the government to pursue “culture war” issues – including a promise that local people will be consulted before street names are changed; and a ban on councils pursuing political boycotts. Dominic Raab’s plan to replace the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights, aimed at curtailing the power of the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, was confirmed as a government priority. The speech said the legislation would “ensure there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government, strengthening freedom of speech”. The president of the Law Society, Stephanie Boyce, attacked the planned legislation, however, warning it would undermine human rights. “If the new bill of rights becomes law, it would make it harder for all of us to protect or enforce our rights. “The proposed changes make the state less accountable. This undermines a crucial element of the rule of law, preventing people from challenging illegitimate uses of power.” The Queens speech also confirmed the fact that proposals for a radical overhaul of the planning system have been ditched, in favour of more modest changes ministers insist will give local people more, not less, say over developments in their neighbourhoods. Previous plans envisaged a zoning system that would introduce a presumption in favour of development in some areas. These were ditched, along with the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick, after the Tories’ shock defeat in the Chesham and Amersham byelection was put partly down to fears the government was about to concrete over the green belt. The Treasury was later forced to dampen hopes of an emergency budget to help hard-pressed households, after Johnson suggested in the debate that he and the chancellor would have more to say on the cost of living crisis, “in the days to come”. Rishi Sunak has repeatedly made clear he is unwilling to act until energy regulator Ofgem has made clear how much it will increase the price cap – an announcement likely to come in August. “We’re not there yet as we don’t know where prices are going to land,” said a Treasury source. A No 10 source confirmed there were unlikely to be new spending measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis – but said all cabinet ministers had been tasked with coming up with policies in their areas to help. The government’s cost of living committee was due to meet on Tuesday evening, ahead of a cabinet awayday in Staffordshire on Thursday. Proposals mooted at previous meetings included deregulating childcare and making MOTs two-yearly.",News/Politics,Queen’s speech: Boris Johnson ‘bereft of ideas’ to tackle cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/queens-speech-boris-johnson-bereft-of-ideas-to-tackle-cost-of-living-crisis
