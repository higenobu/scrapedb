4/12/2022,"Fernandinho shocked Pep Guardiola by revealing he will leave Manchester City in the summer, with the manager saying this was news to him when asked about the midfielder’s departure. The Brazilian will end a nine-year career at the champions in May because he wishes to return to his homeland and play more regularly. Fernandinho has made only 11 starts this season, four since the start of the year, and the 36-year-old is unlikely to be in the XI for Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg at Atlético Madrid. Fernandinho, asked whether he would like to stay another year at City, said: “I don’t think so. Yes, I want to play more; I will go back to Brazil. I decided with my family, which is the most important thing for me. And some people in the club know it.” Yet one of those was not Guardiola. “I didn’t know it,” he said. “You gave me the news. We will see what will happen at the end of the season. I said many times we will see what happens.” When asked again, Guardiola said: “I said at the end of the season we will talk – maybe it is a family decision, maybe he wants more minutes. I would love to be with him.” Guardiola suggested that Txiki Begiristain, City’s sporting director, may have known but insisted that Fernandinho revealing his future this way was nothing underhand. “Maybe Txiki knows it and didn’t tell me,” Guardiola said. “I don’t know. It is a surprise for me; I will say to him [Txiki]: ‘What happened?’ But I know his [Fernandinho’s] intentions. Another player would do it for his benefit. Knowing Ferna, it will not be this.” Guardiola can comprehend his reasoning for departing. “Absolutely,” he said. “I want the happiness of my players and absolutely we are going to play tomorrow for him and give him the best farewell moment, reaching again the semi-final of the Champions League and try to go through again. “I understand the players want to play, it is completely understandable. Not just because he is 35 or 36. Look what happened with Ferran Torres: he wanted to play [so joined Barcelona]. I understand Ferna wants go back to Brazil, with his father and mother there, and I am pretty sure the club is going to help him do what he wants.” City hold a 1-0 lead against Atlético. “We can be better than the first leg,” Guardiola said. “It will be different due to the fact we played here [home] and they were defending deep most of the time. It is not going to happen this time. There are moments we will have to defend. You have to adapt. I said after the first leg: ‘You did it perfectly guys.’ We are going to try to go through.” Rúben Dias will travel as part of the squad after recovering from a hamstring injury that has ruled him out since the start of last month. The centre-back will not start.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola shocked by Fernandinho announcing Manchester City exit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/pep-guardiola-shocked-by-fernandinho-announcing-manchester-city-exit
4/12/2022,"A man has been found guilty of murdering his partner’s three-year-old son who died in 2018 from severe abdominal injuries after weeks of “horrendous” cruelty. Nathaniel Pope, 32, was found unanimously guilty at Birmingham crown court on Tuesday, while Kemarni Watson Darby’s mother, 30-year-old Alicia Watson, was cleared of murdering her son but found guilty of causing or allowing the child’s death. Kemarni suffered more than 20 rib fractures in weeks of beatings before his death, with experts saying his body had been subjected to force similar to a car crash. Watson and Pope both blamed each other for the injuries, while the jury was told the pair were “partners in crime” who continued to live together for several months after Kemarni’s death. Giving evidence during the trial, Watson said she left her son at home in West Bromwich with Pope on 5 June 2018 while she did the school run. She returned to find Kemarni lying on the sofa “staring into space”, and said he was floppy and unresponsive, prompting her to call 999. Watson told police at the time that Pope had never done anything around her son to cause her concern, but during the trial she said she believed he was responsible for the boy’s death. Kemarni was taken to hospital and placed on a life support machine which was turned off later that evening when doctors established he would not be able to breathe unaided. Pope, who had previous convictions for common assault, burglary and possession of heroin with intent to supply, is said to have “crushed” Kemarni’s ribcage in the fatal attack. The prosecution said Kemarni had been subjected to “extremely painful” assaults in the months before his death, and was left with a split abdomen and major internal bleeding after the brutal assault. A forensic pathologist said the type of injuries Kemarni sustained were normally seen in a fall from a height or in a road traffic collision, and there was also evidence of older injuries including fractures to his ribs. He also suffered extensive internal bruising and lacerations to his liver and colon. Watson told jurors she had taken her son to a GP walk-in centre on the day of his death, with medical notes saying he had been vomiting for five days and was “not his usual self”. Staff prescribed the boy rehydration medication for what was thought to be a viral stomach bug. Kemarni’s father, Darren Darby, told the trial he knew his son was being slapped, punched and kicked by his “strict” mother and said he had warned Watson to be cautious of Pope. “Everybody did know that she was beating Kemarni. We all let him down,” he said. Sam Evans, the manager of Kemarni’s nursery, raised concerns to Watson about injuries, including a split lip, on two occasions, and other family members had also noticed bruising. Pope, of Wolverhampton, and Watson, of Handsworth, Birmingham, were also convicted of a single count each of child cruelty to Kemarni between 1 May and 5 June 2018, relating to the infliction of rib fractures and an abdominal injury prior to the fatal injury. The pair were also separately convicted of two further counts of child cruelty in relation to other children. Both will be sentenced at a later date.",News/UK news,Man found guilty of murdering partner’s son in West Bromwich,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/12/man-found-guilty-of-murdering-partners-son-in-west-bromwich
4/12/2022,"A young male peregrine falcon that hatched at Salisbury Cathedral two years ago and became an internet star during the early days of the first Covid lockdown has spread his wings and reached the island of Guernsey, more than 100 miles away. Osmund, the only male of four chicks raised on the cathedral tower in spring 2020, was spotted on the coast of the Channel island and identified by his blue ring bearing the initials YK. According to the wildlife charity the RSPB, peregrines usually stay within 60 miles of their birthplace, so Osmund has proved to be something of an adventurer. Salisbury Cathedral said he was probably searching for his own territory and a mate. He is in his full adult plumage and ready to breed. Some peregrines do mate in the first year but most start breeding as two-year-olds. Ed Drewitt of the British Trust for Ornithology, who ringed Osmund, said: “Some Cornish peregrines have reached the French coast. However, I don’t know of any other birds, particularly from this area, flying to the Channel Islands.” Osmund was the first of the 2020 chicks to fledge – develop wing feathers large enough to fly. He was named after St Osmund, the first bishop of Salisbury, who built the original cathedral at Old Sarum, two miles north of the modern city. His three female siblings were named after individuals who played a significant role in the cathedral’s early history: Ela, Katherine and Honor, to mark the 800th anniversary of the building’s foundation. Seven hundred people took part in the public vote after the peregrine webcam became one of the unusual sources of joy and succour people turned to at the start of the Covid pandemic. Only two other peregrines have been spotted since fledging from the cathedral tower. Peter, who hatched in 2014, was shot near Stockbridge, Hampshire, in March 2017 and nursed for more than two months by the Hawk Conservancy Trust before being released back into the wild. He has since been nesting with his mate in a Hampshire quarry and has fledged his own chicks. The other peregrine spotted away from home was Aveline, a female that fledged in 2016 and was spotted in a Milton Keynes nature reserve in January 2017. More than half of the peregrines that fledge annually do not survive their first year and, despite being protected by law, are still persecuted.",News/Environment,Wing and a preyer: Salisbury Cathedral’s star falcon flies nest to Guernsey,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/12/salisbury-cathedral-star-falcon-flies-nest-guernsey-osmund
4/12/2022,"Though equivocal about many aspects of religion, Graham Greene had nearly supernatural gifts of prophecy as a novelist. The Quiet American (1955) spookily previewed America’s disaster in Vietnam. Three years later, Our Man in Havana, in which an English expat vacuum cleaner salesman in Cuba sells fake secrets to MI6 for cash, was an espionage farce that turned serious with the Iraq “dodgy dossier” and other blurring of fact and fabrication. Greene’s spy fiction heir, John le Carré, so admired Our Man in Havana that he wrote an acknowledged homage in The Tailor of Panama. In their musical version, world premiering at the picturesque and enterprising Watermill, Richard Hough (book and lyrics) and Ben Morales Frost (music), are alert to both the story’s topicalities about the unreliability of information and the chain of literary heritage. One of the strongest songs, The Perfect Spy, alluding to a Le Carré title, nicely honours two of the greatest English writers about public and private deceit. The score is geographically two-tone – mambo and rumba rhythms for locals, such as the twice-reprised The Streets of Havana – and Noël Cowardly recitative and patter for Nigel Lister’s imperfect spy James Wormold. As Milly, the teenager whose shopping and equestrian bills lead her divorced father to trade falsehoods, Daniella Agredo Piper appropriately moves between the musical dual nationalities. The performers deserve an ensemble award for astonishing multi-skilling. Lister accompanies on double bass or guitar the few scenes he isn’t in. Adam Keast, fast-changing between the parts of a Whitehall spymaster and a Cuban secret policeman, also finds time for string and percussion. Paula James plays two contrasting women, plus guitar and drums. On the tiny stage, Abigail Pickard Price’s neat direction somehow prevents anyone getting pranged by bow, drumstick or the quick-change bits of Kat Heath’s ingenious set, in which pianos suddenly become urinals, bookcases or cars. As is often the case with new musicals, it feels another rigorous workshop away from becoming the absolute pleasure attainable. In the second half, the book contains too much novel: Greene’s great scene of a game of draughts with spirit miniatures as pieces is curiously spoken, not sung. But while the novel has dated in some ways – its first line of dialogue contains the n-word – this show enjoyably and intelligently distils Greene’s lasting truths about lying. Our Man in Havana is at the Watermill theatre, Newbury, until 21 May.",Arts/Stage,Our Man in Havana review – Graham Greene classic becomes a clever musical,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/12/our-man-in-havana-review-graham-greene-classic-becomes-a-clever-musical
4/12/2022,"Tyson Fury and other senior figures in boxing have been warned to cut all ties with Irish alleged crime boss Daniel Kinahan, whose gang was targeted with fresh sanctions and a $5m bounty by the US government on Tuesday. The WBC heavyweight champion has previously praised Kinahan, a founder of boxing management company MTK Global, and was photographed with him just weeks ago in Dubai. But in an extraordinary press conference in Dublin, the US ambassador to Ireland, Claire Cronin, revealed that the department of the treasury is now offering a reward of $5m for information that will lead to the “financial destruction” of the Kinahan Organised Crime Group (KOGC) or the arrest and conviction of its leaders. It came after the US Treasury imposed sanctions on Kinahan and another six of the group’s alleged ringleaders – including his father Christopher Snr and brother Christopher Jnr – banning banks and other companies from doing business with them. Kinahan, who attempted to make a proposed all-British superfight against Anthony Joshua last year and is involved with several boxers, has become one of the most influential figures in the sport. Recently he also received the “full support” of World Boxing Council president, Mauricio Sulaiman, who praised him for “improving boxers’ lives in a special way”. However, Irish police commissioner Drew Harris said that anyone in boxing who deals with Kinahan should be in no doubt they were involving themselves with serious criminals. “What was implicit before, and what some individuals could choose to ignore, is absolutely explicit — if you deal with the individuals who are sanctioned as part of the Kinahan organised crime gang, you are dealing with criminals engaged in drug trafficking,” he said. “And, indeed, as we have seen here very tragically in Ireland and also in Spain, murderous feuds who will resort to vicious actions up to and including murder.”Harris, who said that the Kinahan gang was worth more than €1bn through its criminal enterprise, was also asked specifically about Kinahan’s links to sport. “If you deal with these individuals who have been sanctioned, or these entities who are being sanctioned, you are involved in a criminal network,” he replied. Harris also had a message for broadcasters, such as BT Sport, Sky, the BBC and TalkSport who have continued to show Fury’s fights and other boxers associated with MTK. “I’d ask them to look at their own business, at the probity of their own business and the relationship with their fans and, really, is this something they want to be involved with in terms of their legitimate business,” he said. “I think the answer to that is a resounding no.” The Guardian has asked all four broadcasters for a response. Fury, the WBC champion, is defending his title against Dillian Whyte in an all-British fight in London on 23 April, a fight that will be shown on BT Sport and TalkSport. The Kinahan crime gang, which emerged in Dublin in the 1990s has been called one of the world’s largest organised crime groups by the US Drug Enforcement Agency. In a statement announcing new sanctions overnight against the cartel overnight, US Under-Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E Nelson said that the gang “smuggles deadly narcotics, including cocaine, to Europe, and is a threat to the entire licit economy through its role in international money laundering”. “Criminal groups like the KOCG prey on the most vulnerable in society and bring drug-related crime and violence, including murder, to the countries in which they operate,” he added. Matt Horne, a deputy director of the National Crime Agency, which has previously secured convictions against two other senior members of the crime group, said the sanctions would deal a significant blow to them. “We target criminals who cause the most harm, are the most violent, those who exploit the vulnerable, and dominate communities. The Kinahan crime group falls into all of those categories,” he said. “They have transcended international boundaries – distributing multi-million pound shipments of drugs throughout Ireland, the UK and mainland Europe, and have been engaging in firearms trafficking and money laundering. “They thought they were untouchable but the sanctions imposed today will be a huge blow to the Kinahans. It has cut them off from the global financial system, making them toxic to legitimate businesses and financial institutions, and will cause other criminals to think twice about doing business with them.” The US also sanctioned three businesses identified as “Kinahan associates”, including the UAE-based Hoopoe Sports, which lists five boxers as clients according to its website: Paddy Barnes, Jamie Conlan, Michael Conlan, Hughie Fury, and Billy Joe Saunders. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by those fighters. Kinahan, who is now based in Dubai and has no criminal convictions, has always denied any wrongdoing.",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury warned to cut ties with alleged crime boss Daniel Kinahan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/12/tyson-fury-warned-to-cut-ties-with-alleged-crime-boss-daniel-kinahan-boxing
4/12/2022,"American Keira Woods (Elisha Cuthbert) and her Irish husband Brian (Eoin Macken) appear to work in some kind of social network-specific marketing, figuring out how to best push content at target audiences. It’s the sort of new-fangled, 21st-century area of entrepreneurial endeavour people seem to love to hate, perhaps because the work seems so invisible and inchoate yet vastly remunerative. Given the moral calculus of horror films, that means they’re ripe to become the targets of even more insidious forces. And so it goes, when they buy an abandoned mansion in the Irish exurbs and move in with their two kids – sulky teenager Ellie (Abby Fitz), none too pleased with the move, and amiable younger brother Steven (Dylan Fitzmaurice Brady). Ironically, given their work presumably relies on manipulative algorithms and metrics, the evil resident in their new home seems to have something to do with the mathematical symbols carved into the stones over the doorways and walls. The murky explication dump halfway through – courtesy of a maths professor (Aaron Monaghan) who had a car accident and went from being practically innumerate to a maths savant – as you do – adds physicist Erwin Schrödinger to our old friend and Satanic avatar Baphomet, and multiplies the sum with some hushed mentions of alchemy to suggest the house’s cellar is a gateway to somewhere unpleasant. Surely this will have a terrible effect on the property’s resale value. Writer-director Brendan Muldowney is better at contriving striking images of horror, filmed with umbral gloom by cinematographer Tom Comerford, than at the character and story stuff. There’s something very odd, for instance, about the way one of the kids goes missing and the parents appear to practically shrug and get back to work. And the sudden introduction of an addled old dear (Marie Mullen) prophesying doom is pure horror movie cliche, but there are a few genuine scares along the way that work well enough.

4/12/2022,"Anti-fossil fuel activists have vowed to continue blockading oil terminals until they are jailed, as they approached 1,000 arrests for their actions so far. “Ministers have a choice: they can arrest and imprison Just Stop Oil supporters or agree to no new oil and gas,” Just Stop Oil said on Tuesday morning. “While Just Stop Oil supporters have their liberty the disruption will continue.” Fuel-blockade activists were taking their first day off in 12 days on Tuesday, after beginning their campaign on 1 April. “We decided to give them a break,” a campaign spokesperson said. About 400 people have been arrested a total of 900 times for taking action so far, according to the campaign. On Monday, about 40 were arrested at Inter Terminals in Grays, Essex, some after spending more than 38 hours locked on to pipework above the loading bay. Between 15 and 20 who had helped dig tunnels under access roads to the Kingsbury oil terminal were arrested on Sunday and Monday, Just Stop Oil said. The campaign’s statement came after the prime minister’s spokesperson condemned protesters’ “guerrilla tactics” and the home secretary complained that “people across the country [were] seeing their lives brought to a standstill”. On Tuesday, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy accused Labour’s Steve Reed, the shadow justice minister, of “irresponsible scaremongering” after he said “millions” could not get fuel because of the protests. “Just Stop Oil protest activity at some oil terminals has led to short-term disruptions to fuel deliveries over the past few days. The police are working to remove protesters from sites so normal deliveries can resume,” a BEIS spokesperson said. “We are working closely with industry to ensure that supplies are maintained. The public should continue to purchase fuel as normal.” Disruption continued elsewhere. In London, the Lloyd’s insurance market stopped trading on Tuesday after about 60 activists from Extinction Rebellion blocked the entrances to its headquarters and stopped workers from getting inside. “People used superglue, chains and bike locks to block over 25 entrances to the building. Staff already inside were allowed to exit. Climbers also scaled the outside of the iconic building and dropped two banners, saying ‘End Fossil Fuels Now’ and ‘Insure Climate Justice’,” XR said. XR had called on supporters to take a week off work and join mass actions in London this week. After a weekend in which protests had blocked the West End and two bridges over the Thames, on Monday and Tuesday the plan was for “outreach” activities, with members asked to go door-to-door to talk to people about government inaction on the climate crisis. The outreach activities were part of the XR’s 3.5% project, which has mobilised members of local XR groups to spread the group’s message in their communities. “Since we launched in January, over 70 local groups have taken part, we’ve had nearly 4,000 conversations on the doorstep and more than 80% of those who have seen the talk have signed up to join XR,” XR said. Some members of XR have privately said the canvassing has proven difficult, with thousands of flyers handed out in some areas of the country to get just a few dozen to in-person meetings. But others say such activities had helped to achieve a better than expected mobilisation for the weekend’s protest actions. Mass actions were to resume on Wednesday, according to a timetable circulated by XR, with supporters asked to gather from 10am in Hyde Park. Meanwhile, more than 80 scientists, signed a letter to Greg Hands, the energy minister, saying they support the call made by a hunger striker for a climate change briefing for all MPs from Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientist. As Angus Rose began his 30th day without food, the scientists, including Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser, Prof Julia Steinberger, an author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and Prof Susan Michie, a member of the government’s Sage advisory body, said they “unanimously support” the idea of the briefing – even if they did not all agreed with Rose’s methods. “The crisis is evolving at a rapid pace, and it is increasingly difficult for politicians to understand the significance of the latest science that they do not have time to read and digest,” the letter states.",News/Environment,Just Stop Oil protesters vow to continue until ‘all are jailed’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/12/just-stop-oil-protesters-vow-to-continue-until-all-are-jailed
4/12/2022,"This week, climate activists disrupted the UK’s oil supply, because they believe they face a desperate choice. Nonviolent resistance now, or the unthinkable violence of climate change later. “There is a need to break the law,” says Just Stop Oil’s Melissa Carrington, “so we are not guilty of greater crime.” But is she right? In so-called liberal democracies, we have a default obligation to obey the law. It’s a moral duty, as well as a legal one. It’s part of our implicit contract with the government we elected,which provides us, in return, with the protection of justice. But what happens when that government doesn’t keep its side of the bargain? Then, according to numerous political thinkers, we not only can, but very possibly should, break some laws: peacefully, publicly and on principle. The aim? To bring policy into line with what justice actually requires. Henry David Thoreau gave this a name: civil disobedience. John Rawls, as pivotal a social contract thinker as you are likely to find, thought it could be good for social stability and justice, so long as it challenged longstanding, serious injustice. And what could be more unjust than supporting an industry that kills people? We can be more or less controversial here. Is civil disobedience morally OK because governments aren’t progressive enough when it comes to protecting non-humans? Because they allow sentient animals to be tortured in factory farms, or 30% of species to be wiped out by the climate crisis? Some philosophers, such as Peter Singer, think so. Our fellow animals, they say, are entitled to political consideration even though they can’t participate in democratic decision-making. Others point out, less provocatively, that although a government is mainly answerable to those living within its own borders, it still owes basic justice to other humans. It shouldn’t give them encephalitis or dengue fever, or starve them to death. There are grounds for disobedience even if we think only about what governments should and shouldn’t do to their own citizens. The climate crisis threatens our children and grandchildren with heatwaves, floods, wildfires, and untold mental anguish. By propping up the fossil fuel industry, our government puts their whole future in jeopardy. If that’s not a serious injustice, I’m not sure what is. Then there’s environmental resistance. Rather than grabbing attention through general disruption, the activists aim to prevent injustice, directly. “This isn’t like sitting in the middle of random roads,” says Zak, a 15-year-old activist who was arrested as part of the Just Stop Oil protests. “As well as saying to the government, ‘We are demanding no new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea’, it is also stopping the gears of production.” Is this better, or worse? The philosophers Ten-Herng Lai and Chong-Ming Lim think it’s fairer to inconvenience oil and gas giants than the general public, because they’re the ones doing the harm. Or think about it like this. If activists focus on preventing states from extracting oil or natural gas, they might do something else as well: challenge government overreach. “Some philosophers question whether territorial rights should extend to underground natural resources,” says Megan Blomfield, a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield, “since it’s not like anybody did anything to put them there. And where the resource is scarce or its use can harm other people, there’s additional reason to question any entitlement for the state to do what it likes with it.” Of course, caveats remain. Is this mass law-breaking a last resort? It looks like it. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been issuing warnings for 32 years now, but states’ commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions fall abysmally short of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Actual policies put us on track for a terrifying 2.7C increase by 2100, and the UK shows no sign of doing its fair share. And will it work? It might, if the numbers are right. “We’ve seen through history that the only way mass change is achieved is through these mass campaigns like the women’s suffrage or the civil rights movements,” says Zak. It makes sense to diversify tactics. Just activism should be inclusive, and risking arrest is only a viable strategy for the comparatively privileged, not those already at the receiving end of police intimidation. There’s also evidence that successful movements use a range of approaches, from lobbying and voting to strikes and, yes, civil disobedience. But social scientists Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth studied major resistance campaigns between 1900 and 2006 and found that the nonviolent ones succeeded more than half the time. (More than twice as often, incidentally, as the violent ones.) The key to success? The so-called “3.5% rule”, because that’s the proportion of the population that needs to get involved. And here’s something else to bear in mind. These movements also challenge participatory injustice, where those with most at stake are excluded from decision-making. Many climate protesters are too young to vote. They are denied a voice in determining their own future, while politicians accept gifts worth millions from climate sceptics and fossil fuel interests. Through activism, including civil disobedience, they demand to be heard. When future generations look back on this period, as we look back on earlier epoch-defining campaigns, they’ll ask who showed more respect for justice and democracy: the activists so many of us find disruptive, or the governments they are trying to reform. I think we know what their answer will be.

4/12/2022,"Tribal communities will soon have access to $46m to tackle effects of the climate crisis, which disproportionately threaten Indigenous Americans’ food supplies, livelihoods and infrastructure. The funds are part of a historic five-year investment plan under Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, intended to improve climate resilience and adaptation in tribal territories. Some communities will have to relocate because of rising sea levels and storm surges. “As the effects of climate change continue to intensify, Indigenous communities are facing unique climate-related challenges that pose existential threats to tribal economies, infrastructure, lives and livelihoods,” said Deb Haaland, the secretary of the interior and America’s first Indigenous cabinet secretary. “President Biden’s historic investments in tribal communities will help bolster community resilience, replace aging infrastructure and provide support needed for climate-related community-driven relocation and adaptation.” Across the US, the climate crisis, caused by unchecked greenhouse gas emissions, poses particular threats to Indigenous culture and livelihoods closely tied to local ecosystems. Of the 574 federally recognized tribes in the US, 40% live in Alaska Native communities, where rapidly rising temperatures, melting sea ice and glaciers, and thawing permafrost are causing significant problems for critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges and housing. Alaska Natives are among America’s first climate refugees, with almost 90% of villages susceptible to flooding and erosion. In the south-west, inland communities including the Navajo and Tohono O’odham nations face worsening drought and extreme heat. Indigenous people across the world have contributed almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions that cause global heating, having once thrived through ecologically sustainable agriculture, fishing and hunting traditions. Yet traditional medicines, foods such as fish and game, and wild and cultivated crops are now in decline, Access is often further limited by reservation boundaries. By the end of the century, more than half of US salmon and trout habitats are expected to be lost. Many tribes have relied on such fish for food, cultural practices and economic development. Biden’s infrastructure law provides $466m to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, including $216m for climate resilience programs. Of that funding, $130m is provided for community relocation, $86m is provided for climate resilience and adaptation projects, and $43.2m will be available to spend annually for five years. Tribes can submit proposals to the Department of the Interior for a share of the first installment of new funding, which promises to recognise tribal ecological knowledge and traditional sustainable practices, and to support community-driven rather than imposed relocation. While the money has been welcomed, it is nowhere near enough, or supplied fast enough, to combat the effects of extreme heat, rising sea level, flooding and other climate phenomena which are already causing chaos.",News/World news,US indigenous communities to receive $46m to address global heating,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/us-indigenous-communities-46m-global-heating
