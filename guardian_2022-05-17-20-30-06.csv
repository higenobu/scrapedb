5/17/2022,"If you have sneezed your way through the last few days, you are not alone. About a quarter of the UK population are thought to suffer from hay fever, with numbers continuing to grow. And the latest research suggests that the climate crisis is going to make the hay fever season a whole lot longer and more intense, with up to three times as much pollen wafting around by the end of the century. Hold on to your antihistamines. For people with lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pollen bursts are a serious risk that can be deadly in the most extreme cases. In November 2016, a pollen outbreak caused by a thunderstorm fragmenting pollen into smaller pieces in Melbourne, Australia, overwhelmed the emergency services and resulted in at least nine deaths. Already we are feeling the effects of a longer growing season, with plants in the UK having a whole extra month of productivity compared with 30 years ago. Birch, alder and oak trees are usually first to bloom, spraying their pollen – the dust-like grains that hay fever sufferers are allergic to – as early as February, in some years. The deciduous trees are followed by grass pollen in late spring and summer, and finally weed pollen (such as ragweed and dock) is picked up by the breeze in later summer and early autumn. The impact of the longer growing season has been felt most in the north of Britain. One recent study showed that the onset of the oak pollen season in Invergowrie, Scotland, now starts some 20 days earlier compared with the 1990s. At the same time, our changing climate is altering the distribution of allergenic plants, with some particularly potent species invading new areas. But the main driver of growing pollen is increasing levels of carbon dioxide. While higher temperatures extend the growing season, carbon dioxide fuels photosynthesis, enabling plants to grow larger and produce more pollen. Researchers from the University of Michigan have been monitoring pollen production from 15 different types of plant across the US. Using a climate model, they projected how the pollen production is likely to change between now and 2100. Under a high carbon-emissions scenario, their modelling suggests that this boost to plant growth, plus greater overlap in the pollination season for trees, grasses and weeds, will result in a whopping 200% increase in pollen levels across the US by 2100. Evidence is also emerging that air pollution is enhancing the allergenicity of pollen particles. Some pollutants such as nitrogen dioxides (predominantly from car exhaust pipes) are thought to bind themselves to pollen particles and exacerbate allergic disorders. Others damage the surface of the pollen grain, releasing lots of mini-fragments of pollen that can penetrate deeper into the lungs. So what can we do to tackle the misery that hay fever brings? In urban areas, reducing levels of air pollution is an obvious quick fix: car-free zones, low-traffic neighbourhoods and clean air zones will all help air pollution to fall. Meanwhile, choosing to plant low-allergenic trees and grasses is important too, as is designing green spaces carefully, to avoid tree canopies acting as a lid for air pollutants. Avoiding the pollen boost from rising levels of carbon dioxide is trickier though. Clearly we need to make every effort to reduce our carbon emissions to avoid the worst impacts of the climate emergency, but even if we were to eliminate our carbon emissions tomorrow, the cumulative effect from our historical emissions has locked in an increase in carbon dioxide until about 2060 at least. So we can’t stop the pollen explosion that additional carbon dioxide will bring, but we can forecast it. In the same way that weather forecasts help people to prepare for and avoid dangerous weather, researchers are confident that we can increase the accuracy of our pollen forecasts, enabling people to take preventive action. Scientists at the University of Worcester and their colleagues have been using weather and pollen measurements from across north-west Europe to give advance warning of how severe a pollen season is going to be, based on the weather conditions in the preceding months (which affect the vigour with which a plant grows). Meanwhile, scientists from the University of Michigan have been combining pollen measurements, weather forecasts and satellite data to pinpoint where and when pollen starts to be sprayed, in order to develop targeted and precise pollen forecasts. These kind of pollen early warning systems will be a crucial tool for the future, alerting sufferers to dose up on antihistamines, wear a mask outdoors and stay indoors during peak-pollen parts of the day. Like flooding, heatwaves and other extreme weather, more intense and widespread hay fever is yet another consequence of the climate crisis that we are just going to have to learn to live with.

5/17/2022,"The V&A has been urged to investigate why the museum auctioned a private tour as a prize at a Conservative fundraising dinner when one of its trustees is a Tory party chair. In a letter to the commissioner on public appointments, Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, said the auction was a clear breach of the code of conduct for trustees of public bodies. Ben Elliot, a V&A trustee, is co-chair of the Conservative party and has faced repeated questioning over the use of his concierge firm, Quintessentially, and services it has provided to Russian oligarchs. The tour was auctioned at the spring lunch party fundraiser by the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly, including the museum’s chair, Nicholas Coleridge, showing the winning Tory donor “his 10 favourite items” in the museum’s collection, according to the Mail on Sunday. In the letter copied to the V&A director, Tristram Hunt, and the Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport permanent secretary, Powell said the offer “raises new questions about the conflicts of interest that seems to be so common with this Conservative government and public bodies”. In the code of conduct for board members of public bodies, it says: “In your public role, you should be, and be seen to be, politically impartial. You should not occupy a paid party political post or hold a particularly sensitive or high-profile role in a political party. You should abstain from all controversial political activity.” It continues: “You must not use, or attempt to use, the opportunity of public service to promote your personal interests or those of any connected person, firm, business or other organisation.” Powell said the revelations proved the Conservatives were “still selling off political access and perks to Tory donors instead of coming up with a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis”. In a statement, the V&A said: “The V&A understands that a short tour of the museum with Nicholas Coleridge was offered at auction at the spring lunch. No V&A staff or resources were involved and no special access to the museum was offered. We understand that neither Ben Elliot or Nicholas Coleridge attended the event.” Powell said the V&A was risking its reputation as a world-leading museum. She added: “It has survived over 150 years on the basis of its groundbreaking exhibitions, housed in one of the most historic Victorian buildings in Britain. It would be unacceptable for the museum, charity and public body to be brought into disrepute by a rogue trustee and his links to Conservative party sleaze.” Quintessentially has said Elliot no longer has day-to-day control over the business with a role similar to a non-executive director. The firm has previously said it “completely condemns President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine” and was “monitoring its member base to ensure it was not servicing any individual or corporate body on sanctions lists, confirming that there were none so far”. It deleted a webpage detailing its presence in Russia, with about 50 staff in the country, which had said the company had “15 years’ experience providing luxury lifestyle management services to Russia’s elite and corporate members”.The Conservative party has been approached for comment.",News/Politics,V&A at centre of row over auction of private tour as prize at Tory fundraising event,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/va-at-centre-of-row-over-auction-of-private-tour-as-prize-at-tory-fundraising-event
5/17/2022,"Land Securities has reported record office leasing in London as the lifting of Covid restrictions fuels a return of workers and a surge in demand for prime space, as the property company bounced back to profit last year. Landsec is one of Britain’s biggest property firms and about 60% of its portfolio is in central London. It reported a pre-tax profit of £875m in the year to the end of March. The company, which owns offices such as Deutsche Bank’s London headquarters and an office complex near St Paul’s Cathedral, reported a loss of £1.4bn the previous year as the coronavirus pandemic shut down offices across the UK. “Reports of the demise of office working may have been premature, judging by a return to profit for Land Securities,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell. “Astonishingly in central London the company is seeing record leasing levels. In a competitive jobs market where employers probably want their staff in the office at least some of the time, attractive locations with flexible space are a must.” Landsec said it intends to cash in on the post-pandemic office space boom by investing £3bn in “sustainable London offices and mixed use development” over the next five years. The company said that it struck a record £63m of office leases in the past year, on average 4% ahead of valuers’ assumptions. Landsec said office occupancy across its portfolio reached 95.3%, “demonstrating strong demand for high-quality space”. Landsec’s shopping mall portfolio, which includes Bluewater in Kent and Trinity Leeds, also experienced a return to growth in the second half of its financial year. Like-for-like retail sales were 1.1% ahead of its 2019/20 financial year and occupancy rose 1.7 percentage points to 93.2%, as retailers hoped to take advantage of shoppers returning to malls. Landsec, which paid £126m for an additional 18.75% stake in Bluewater and £426m for a 75% stake in MediaCityUK in Greater Manchester during the year, said that it signed, or is processing, £29m of lettings deals for retail space. “There has been a recovery in Landsec’s retail locations too as restrictions ease, with the landlord putting effort in making these attractive destinations for shoppers,” Mould said. “Occupancy rates are also up – though this recovery could be cut short as households cut back on spending amid cost of living pressures.” Landsec’s portfolio of offices and shops increased in value by 11% year on year, from £10.8bn to £12bn. “Landsec has delivered strong operational and financial results despite the turbulence within the UK economy,” the LandSec chief executive, Mark Allan, said. “The actions we have taken, driven by our strategic focus on three distinct areas have resulted in record leasing in our London office portfolio, a return to growth in our major retail destinations and clear, substantive progress in growing our mixed-use urban neighbourhood portfolio.” Landsec hopes to sell 21 Moorfields, Deutsche Bank’s new City of London offices, for about £1bn and Allan said that sale is one of “three or four” London office disposals he is considering. “We continue to recycle capital out of mature assets, while our pipeline now offers the opportunity to invest £3bn in sustainable London offices and mixed-use development over the next five years at attractive returns,” he said.

5/17/2022,"Fossil fuel representatives have joined the Morrison government in rejecting scientific warnings that no new oil and gas fields should be opened if the world is to deal with the climate crisis, with a national conference hearing Australia should be “smart enough” to back continued expansion. Increased gas and oil supply was “absolutely part of the solution” to decarbonising the economy, the annual conference of gas industry group the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) was told. The push to open new fossil fuel basins in Australia, which has had support from both major parties, is at odds with a warning by the International Energy Agency that no new oil or gas fields or coalmines should be developed if the world was to keep alive a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal agreed at global climate meetings. The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, reiterated the point last week, saying new oil and gas fields would have little impact on the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, would take years to go ahead and would lock in fossil fuel use and high greenhouse gas emissions for decades. Birol suggested expansion of existing fields could be justified, but said new developments could become stranded assets if the world succeeded in moving to net zero and the momentum for a shift to clean energy had never been greater. He was responding to a Guardian investigation that found fossil fuel companies, including some in Australia, were planning “carbon bomb” projects that would drive the globe to catastrophic heating levels. A peer-reviewed study published on Tuesday suggested that, in addition to new developments not going ahead, nearly half of existing fossil fuel production sites would need to be shut early if the 1.5C goal was to remain viable. A spokesperson for the Morrison government said the Coalition remained “strongly committed to a gas-led recovery”. They said the government was supporting measures to open up the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory, and more oil supply was the “best way to reduce prices in the long term”. “Companies like Woodside and Santos are committing billions of dollars to new gas projects in Australia, which demonstrates the industry’s confidence in its long-term future,” he said. Labor did not respond to questions before publication. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ian Davies, Appea’s chair and the chief executive of oil and gas company Senex Energy, told the gas conference that IEA net zero scenarios suggested oil and gas would still be used in 2050, and must be “absolutely part of the solution” to decarbonisation. But he said being able to capture and store carbon dioxide at a massive scale would have to play a central role if the industry was to be a part of a global decarbonisation. Davies described carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) – usually involving capturing emissions and burying them underground – as “a proven technology”, and said Australia was home to the biggest project in the world, Chevron’s Gorgon development in the Pilbara. It started operation in 2019 and has buried 6m tonnes of emissions. The conference heard there were about 30 CCUS projects across the globe. Santos had begun work on a “world-scale” CCUS project at Moomba in South Australia that would bury 1.7m tonnes a year, and ExxonMobil buried 9m tonnes annually across the globe.

Global emissions from energy use last year were 36.3bn tonnes. Davies said: “The fact is there are proven examples of CCUS, and that fact matters.” He said rather than continue as a net importer of oil products, Australia should “achieve oil security” by encouraging investment in new developments such as Santos’s proposal to open the Bedout Basin in Western Australia and expanding “existing basins where possible”. “Will we be smart enough to unlock the wealth in support of our own domestic industries and to generate export income for our nation?” he asked the conference, being held in Brisbane with a slogan of “positive energy for a changing world”. Guardian Australia asked Australia’s biggest gas companies for their response to the IEA’s statement on the development of new gas fields. Santos declined to comment. A spokesperson for Woodside argued its $16bn Scarborough development was an existing gas field, and not a new development, as it had already been discovered. The company announced last year it had made a final investment decision to develop the field 375km off the Pilbara coast and expected to start production in 2026. The spokesperson said Woodside had a target of reducing its emissions by 30% by 2030, in part by relying on carbon offsets, and an “aspiration” of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. “Woodside sees an important role for Scarborough gas in the energy transition,” the spokesperson said. Gas is often described as having about half the emissions of coal when burned, but global studies have found the actual figure can be higher due to leaks during extraction and transport. The resources minister, Keith Pitt, and Labor’s shadow resources minister, Madeleine King, were due to address the Appea conference by video on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, joined climate protesters outside the conference on Tuesday. He called on the next government to join a pledge to cut emissions of methane – a potent greenhouse gas released during gas extraction – by 30% by 2030. “Gas is as dirty as coal and toxic methane is a climate bomb exploding in our backyard,” he said.",News/Australia news,Industry call for Australia to ‘unlock wealth’ of new oil and gas fields at odds with IEA warning,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/industry-call-for-australia-to-unlock-wealth-of-new-oil-and-gas-fields-at-odds-with-iea-warning
