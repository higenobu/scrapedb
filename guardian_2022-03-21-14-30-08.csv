3/21/2022,"From its “grey box-like” appearance and eye-popping price tag to protracted construction delays, Norway’s new National Museum has kept the critics busy. Located on Oslo’s western waterfront, the £500m museum will be the biggest in the Nordic region when it opens on 11 June. Yet its director, Karin Hindsbo, has felt sufficiently contrite to apologise for extensive delays that kept renowned artworks such as Edvard Munch’s most famous version of The Scream out of public view for years. “That we have not met the audience’s expectations in recent years, I’m sorry,” she wrote in 2020. As the finishing touches are made before its grand opening (an entrance fee is yet to be decided upon, for example) Hindsbo now thinks things are coming together at a timely moment. It is a museum on an epic scale. Across 13,000 sq metres of exhibition space there will be 5,000 works on show at the site off Oslo’s Rådhusplassen, making it bigger than Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum or the Guggenheim in Bilbao. Hindsbo says people will have choices and be offered guidance according to the time and interests that they have. “But I would also say that maybe these days, when things have a tendency to move really really fast, I don’t think it is a bad thing to provide a space that one can stay in for many hours,” she says. “Maybe it is not so bad to get lost in art these days.” The concept of the museum came together in the mid-2000s, but the wisdom of the Norwegian parliament’s decision in 2013 to combine the collections of four existing museums including the highly popular National Gallery has been hotly debated at every turn. Hindsbo says the idea is a good one in that “people will be able to see the whole history of Norwegian cultural heritage and regional cultural inheritance in a global perspective under one roof”, and in conditions that best preserve and show off the pieces. The range of the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, to give its full name, is broad: from the medieval Baldishol tapestry and Chinese imperial porcelain to fashion, Norwegian glass cups of the 18th century and contemporary design and arts and crafts. The second floor is dominated by the visual arts, from Dutch and Flemish landscape paintings to still lifes from the 17th century and Johan Christian Dahl’s 19th-century landscape masterpieces. The museum’s Munch Room has some of the Norwegian painter’s most famous works, including one of his four versions of The Scream. Crowning the building is a 2,400 sq metre Light Hall, visible for miles around at night thanks to 9,000 energy-efficient, adjustable LED lights. To the critics who complain that German architects Kleihues + Schuwerk have spent a fortune and eight years building what has been panned by some as a slate-covered grey box, Hindsbo says the point is how the works will be looked after and displayed inside. The building on the former site of a railway station was designed to blend into its neighbourhood, Hindsbo says. “This is not a tall building, it is low. It is low-maintenance but high-quality and the issue of sustainability is important. All the materials are chosen in a 300-year scope, so nothing should be cast aside in 20 years’ time.” “We should have vines growing on the facade, we have grass on the roof, and you don’t see that yet. And more important is the actual exhibition space, and my humble opinion is that it is a unique exhibition space – such amazing conditions for displaying our collection – and I think the audience will see that and appreciate that once we open.” Hindsbo is likewise unmoved by those who don’t like the museum’s logo, a capital letter “N” followed by an “a” and an “m” cut in half. Some have suggested that it is an attempt to secure a snazzy acronym, in this case Nam, like MoMA (the Museum of Modern Art) in New York. “Our logo is a logo and not a name”, says Hindsbo. “I actually think it works really well.” She is more apologetic about the delays caused by construction complications and then the Covid pandemic, which resulted in some of Norway’s finest pieces of art being out of public view. “It is not funny for a museum to have closed doors, it is not what we do,” she says. In response, some of the most significant works that could be moved have been loaned out over the last year.",News/World news,Norway’s £500m National Museum to open after eight-year wait,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/norways-500m-national-museumto-open-after-eight-year-wait
3/21/2022,"It’s 6am, and the espresso machine at an unusual new business enterprise is whirring. Proprietor Mohammed set up his breakfast kiosk near the West Bank town of Shuweika three weeks ago, and so far trade is good: hundreds of people pass by every day on their walk to work, picking up bread, cucumbers and tomatoes as well as coffee and cigarettes. Two years ago, Palestinians entering this 200-metre-wide part of the militarised “seam zone” between Israel’s West Bank separation barrier and the 1949 armistice line would have been shot at by Israeli soldiers. They still patrol just a few metres away. But on a bright March morning, a steady stream of commuters were walking by Mohammed’s new outfit and clambering through a nearby hole in the fencing, the majority on their way to work in illegal construction, cleaning and agriculture jobs in Israeli communities on the other side. “It’s not a problem any more,” the 30-year-old said. “I’m just happy to find a good job. For years I made money in more dangerous ways.” “I can make $100 a day working there,” said a young man with wavy hair who didn’t want to give his name as he was crossing illegally. “Of course I will go.” Israel started work on the contentious West Bank separation wall 20 years ago to stem Palestinian terror attacks during the second intifada, but the reality of the multi-billion dollar project today is more fluid than it might seem. Despite the walls and fences, Palestinians have always managed to enter Israel. While there is no data, people in the West Bank have begun crossing in increasing numbers over the last few years in search of better-paid work. That used to entail playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) – but since the pandemic hit, the situation appears to have relaxed. Dror Etkes documents illegal Israeli construction in the occupied Palestinian territories for his NGO Kerem Navot and spends most of his time roaming the West Bank in a beaten-up Chinese car. He estimates there are now hundreds of breaches in the barrier, which an unknown number of people use each day. The IDF might occasionally dig a new trench to stop vehicles, he said, but have not moved to fix any of the fences. “The Israeli public was sold this wall as a necessary security measure. My understanding is there’s been a change of policy, and soldiers are now supposed to turn a blind eye to the Palestinians coming in,” he said. “Israel knows it needs to relieve the economic pressure in the West Bank and it benefits from the cheaper labour. Which raises the question: if [the wall] is just an arbitrary construction, why is it here at all?” To date, only around 65% of the barrier’s planned route has been completed: construction stalled long ago owing to a combination of internal politicking, legal battles and international criticism. The majority of the barrier which has been built so far is inside the West Bank, rather than in Israel or on the armistice line. To protect illegal Israeli settlements, some sections reach as deep as 13 miles (22km) into Palestinian territory, dividing communities and leaving farmers reliant on Israeli permits to access their own land. Much of the seam zone is abandoned, strewn with rubbish and used for fly-tipping. In densely populated places like Jerusalem, the barrier takes the form of an eight-metre-high concrete wall topped with concertina wire and cameras. In more rural areas, however, it is often made up of military patrol roads sandwiched between parallel wire fences, sometimes supplemented with barbed wire, trenches and strips of sand for tracking footprints. After meeting Mohammed, the Guardian visited five more points along a 22-mile (35km) stretch of the barrier cutting through the top left-hand corner of the West Bank. Holes had been cut in the fencing there to facilitate access to the Triangle, a cluster of majority-Arab-Israeli towns and villages abutting the Green Line. All of the gaps were big enough for adults to pass through comfortably; incongruously, some were next to locked gates, or close to checkpoints and visible cameras. Some people said they had valid permits, but chose to use the breaches in the fence because it was quicker and easier than queuing at official terminals, where soldiers can question and search them. In a statement, the IDF said: “Damaging the security fence to create passageways which allow unmonitored infiltration into Israeli territory is a security threat and a clear violation of the law. “IDF soldiers are stationed across the security fence in accordance with the situational assessment. The troops use a variety of means in accordance with the rules of engagement.” Neither the Israeli defence ministry, which is responsible for the maintenance of the separation barrier, nor the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat), which implements Israeli government policy in areas of the West Bank under its control, responded to the Guardian’s questions. In the seam zone near Khirbat al-Aqaba, an elderly couple in an old Corolla waited to meet their son, who walked up from the other side to pick up bags of vegetables for the restaurant he works at legally. In the Arab town of Baqa, which was split in two after Israel’s creation, a middle-aged woman dressed in her finest gingerly made her way through a hole in the fence and across a muddy stream bridged by wooden goods pallets to visit her sister, who lives on the Israeli side. And near Umm al-Fahm, a rupture in the fence down the hill from what appeared to be an improvised checkpoint, controlled by a group of local men not responsible for the safety of Israeli citizens, was big enough for cars. Tyre tracks in the sand suggested it was being used for that purpose. Very few people dare to cross when they can see an IDF patrol nearby, and there are still dangers. In May 2020, soldiers ambushed workers trying to cross near Faroun, shooting eight people in the legs. But the ease with which people are now using breaches in the fence – and the carefree attitude displayed by most – is a striking change. One elderly man trying to get from one side of Baqa to the other even argued back with an IDF patrol unit. Rather than make an arrest, they told him to take his papers to the official checkpoint. Up until at least 2019, there were fewer gaps, and crossings were usually arranged by paid fixers: those entering Israel had to run through dangerous sections, climbing over walls, under razorwire and through drainage systems, all under the cover of darkness. Unemployment in the West Bank has hovered at around 25% for several years, and wages are much lower than in Israel. Once they arrived, many workers remained in Israel for a week or longer, avoiding police or anyone who might report them, until they had earned enough to risk making the journey home again. Even working with no rights in sometimes dangerous conditions, the risk was worth it. The pandemic also curtailed the ability of Asian and eastern European service and construction workers to come to Israel, so Israeli businesses’ appetite for cheaper Palestinian labour has increased despite the risk of raids, stop-work orders and fines for employers who are caught. Such a large flow of people still poses an undeniable security challenge. Some of the illegal workers making the crossing wondered if Israeli surveillance technology is sophisticated enough to monitor persons of interest from afar, or whether some of the Palestinian vendors, makeshift car park attendants and taxi drivers who now service the breaches are informants for the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service. For now, most seem happy to take advantage of the economic opportunities the increasingly porous barrier has created. On a windy plateau above Zemer, a local council in Israel created from the merger of four Palestinian villages, Mohammed Bakir, his son and several legal West Bank employees were using bulldozers to level the earth near their house in the seam zone, hoping to cultivate the land. After the Gilboa prison break last September, all the crossing terminals were closed, and his workers could not enter Israel for several days while the authorities hunted for the six escapees. The family know the status quo might change and they may have to abandon the project, but believe it’s still worth trying. From the top of the muddy plain, white blossom from almond and hawthorn trees could be seen drifting onto the rubbish and litter next to the fence below. The barrier meandered to the left and right, a strange grey snake carving up the landscape into before and after.",News/World news,‘It’s not a problem any more’: Israel’s increasingly porous West Bank fence ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/its-not-a-problem-any-more-israels-increasingly-porous-west-bank-fence
3/21/2022,"Victorian transport infrastructure minister Jacinta Allan has called on the federal government to provide the state with its “fair share” of funding after a report found the state was being shortchanged compared with New South Wales and Queensland. The Grattan Institute report, released on Sunday night, found there was a “consistent pattern” of successive federal governments spending more money on transport in New South Wales and Queensland – where elections tend to be won and lost – than in Victoria. Victoria has 26% of Australia’s population, but received just 18% of the federal transport funds over the past 15 years. New South Wales received a third of the transport funding, but has less than a third of the country’s population. Queensland, which has 20% of the country’s population, received 24% of funding. The disparity could not be explained by population, population growth, size of the road network, share of passenger or freight travel, or what it actually costs the state government to run the transport system, the report said. It said the inequity is further “compounded” by the federal government “funnelling much more discretionary transport funding to the most marginal seats. Meanwhile, only one of the 71 coalition major projects worth more than $100m which were promised at the last federal election had a business case approved by Infrastructure Australia. Two of Labor’s 61 promised projects had business cases approved. Allan said the Victorian government would like to see federal-government investment that was proportional to a state’s population. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We have always pushed strongly and assertively to any federal government that we should get our fair share,” Allan said on Monday. “There’s heaps of work going on here in Victoria and yes, the federal government are a partner in some of these projects. But there is so much more that we are doing that they could support us.” Allan said the state government has committed $46bn on removing several level crossings across the state, as well as constructing the Metro Tunnel and the North East Link. Of the three projects, the federal government is contributing $1.75bn to the North East Link. “If we were other states and we were getting 50-50, that figure would be around $23bn. So that’s not a fair and equitable outcome for the state of Victoria,” she said. Allan announced major works will begin in June and will continue throughout the second half of 2022 in Sunbury, northwest of Melbourne, as the level crossing on Gap Road is removed. Gap Road will be closed to traffic between Evans and Horne streets from 30 May to late 2022 as crews remove the boom gates and build the new rail bridge and road underpass, while buses and coaches will replace trains on sections of the Sunbury, Bendigo, Echuca and Swan Hill lines from 3 to 29 June. When trains resume, Gap Road will remain closed to traffic for up to another three months while crews work around the clock to excavate 25,000 cubic metres of soil and build the road underpass.",News/Australia news,Victorian government calls for ‘fair’ commonwealth funding for transport projects ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/victorian-government-calls-for-fair-commonwealth-funding-for-transport-projects
