3/5/2022,"Great Britain have opened their campaign at the Winter Paralympics with a bronze for Millie Knight and her guide Brett Wild in the very first medal event in Beijing. Knight finished third in the visually impaired category of the women’s downhill Alpine skiing behind Henrieta Farkasova of Slovakia, who won the race to claim the 10th gold medal of her career. After the race Knight said: “This bronze is something very special. It ranks above our silver four years ago in Pyeongchang. We have gone through some tough things and it has changed us. Crossing the line with a smile on my face was our No 1 goal. I feel like I’m on cloud nine and I just genuinely can’t believe that this is happening to us.” Britain’s Menna Fitzpatrick finished fifth in the event, while the silver medal went to China’s Zhu Daqing, the first individual medal won at a Winter Paralympics by a Chinese athlete. The hosts made a strong start, with Liu Zixu and Guo Yujie then securing golds in biathlon events among eight Chinese medals in total. The most emotional scenes of the day were at the Zhangjiakou National Biathlon Centre, where Grygorii Vovchynskyi took Ukraine’s first gold of the Games in the men’s sprint standing, and said “please, no war in Ukraine” to the camera at the end of his run. He was warmly congratulated by silver medallist Marco Maier of Germany, who finished just over 45 seconds behind. The German Paralympic committee described them as “medals for peace” in a tweet. Vovchynskyi’s Ukrainian compatriots Liudmyla Liashenko and Taras Rad also picked up biathlon silver medals during the day’s session, which ended with another gold for the nation as Oksana Shyshkova emulated her teammate to win the women’s sprint for visually impaired athletes. The Ukrainian team then went on to sweep the podium in the men’s vision impaired sprint biathlon, with Vitaliy Lukianenko delivering their third gold medal, in front of compatriots Oleksandr Kazik and Dmytro Suiarko. The men’s vision impaired downhill Alpine skiing was won by Austria’s Johannes Aigner who, at 16, is one of the youngest athletes competing in these Games, edging out the defending champion Mac Marcoux of Canada by 0.36 seconds. One of five skiing siblings, three of whom have visual impairments, Aigner first took to the slopes aged four. There was a surprise in the women’s standing event, as the eight-time Paralympic champion and favourite Marie Bochet of France crashed out while attempting to defend her title. The gold went to Canada’s Mollie Jepsen. There was joy for another French competitor, though. Arthur Bauchet finally has a gold in the men’s downhill standing, having secured four silver medals in Pyeongchang. In Beijing last month, New Zealand won their first ever gold medals at winter sports, but they have a greater track record in para sports, and Corey Peters secured the county’s 17th all-time gold medal in para skiing, completing his own personal set that included silver in Sochi and bronze in Pyeongchang. He described winning the men’s downhill sitting as “the icing on the cake” of his career. “I risked everything on that run just then,” he said. “That was probably the run of my life, to be fair.” These Games feature 564 Para athletes, matching the record for participation set at Pyeongchang in 2018. The number would have been higher but for the exclusion of the Russian and Belarusian delegations following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A record 138 women Para athletes are competing. In Russia, state-run news agency Tass has reported that the Russian ministry of sport is planning an alternative Winter Paralympics event featuring the expelled Russian and Belarusian athletes, to be held in the venues which hosted the Games in Sochi in 2014. The Russian state channel Match TV has meanwhile declined to broadcast the Beijing Games, issuing a statement saying: “We express solidarity with our athletes – live broadcasting of the Paralympic Games has been cancelled.”",Sport/Sport,Winter Paralympics 2022: GB win first medal as Ukraine soar on day one,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/winter-paralympics-2022-gb-win-first-medal-as-ukraine-soar-on-day-one
3/5/2022,"Pep Guardiola’s 11 derbies with Ralf Rangnick’s predecessor, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, ended five wins apiece with one draw. Considering Manchester City’s supremacy this was a fair return from the Norwegian and can offer succour to Manchester United. City, though, have Liverpool right behind them as they seek to defend the title so will be particularly focused.

3/5/2022,"With West Ham and Manchester United, the two teams directly above Arsenal, playing Liverpool and Manchester City, respectively, this weekend, the Gunners will feel this game represents an excellent chance to make inroads on fourth place, regardless of the fact they also have three games in hand. Three wins in a row for Mikel Arteta’s side have improved the mood at the Emirates no end after what was a scratchy start to the year. For Roy Hodgson, the euphoria of a point at Old Trafford last week is tempered by only one win this year. Three points from the last safe spot, Watford’s need for a win is more pressing than Arsenal’s, but three league goals all year tells all about where their current weakness lies.

The Manchester City-bothering one, all controlled power and counterattacking, with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min in perfect harmony, or the one that lost 1-0 at Burnley and was then outplayed and lost by the same score at Middlesbrough in the FA Cup? No one knows, of course, least of all Antonio Conte, it seems. Meanwhile, Frank Lampard has guided Everton to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup but knows he cannot be distracted with them only one point above the relegation zone. As a Chelsea player, Lampard knew almost continuous success against Spurs and he will hope he can bring some of that mojo to his struggling side.

3/5/2022,"As the conflict in Ukraine unfolds on your television screen, you may be wondering what you can do to help those caught up in it. Here’s a guide to how you can make a difference. Earlier this week, the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) launched a Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal to raise funds for food, water, medicine, protection and trauma care for people fleeing the war. At times of crisis, the DEC brings together 15 leading UK aid charities (including the British Red Cross, Cafod, Care International and Save the Children UK) to raise funds quickly and efficiently. This is one of the best appeals to give to because every pound donated by the UK public to the DEC will be matched by the government, up to the value of £20m. You can donate at a Post Office, as well as directly. Other charities have also launched appeals and continue to need public support. Here’s a roundup of what some of the other big aid charities are doing.  The UN Refugee Agency estimates that about 660,000 refugees have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries. In Poland, it is providing new arrivals with information and legal services through a local legal partner. In Romania, it is providing advice on asylum procedures and is offering legal advice and psychological support through partners. At the border with Moldova, it is distributing essential relief items, including blankets, sleeping bags and hygiene items, and it is also working at the Slovakian and Hungarian borders. Where possible, it is liaising with community leaders in Ukraine to assess their humanitarian needs and also delivering essential aid to internally displaced people. You can donate online.  The British Red Cross has its own appeal as well as being part of DEC. Alongside supporting people in Ukraine, donations will help its teams on the Polish, Slovakian, Romanian, Hungarian, Moldovan and Lithuanian borders to provide accommodation, food, water and other aid items to refugees. You can donate online by card or PayPal, as well as via the DEC appeal.  The charity Care International is providing emergency relief through its partner, People in Need, which is already working on the ground in the region. Over the past week, this non-governmental, non-profit organisation has been sending trucks of durable food, hygiene items, nappies, sleeping bags, mats, and other goods into Lviv in western Ukraine to distribute to people locally. On the Slovakian border, PIN is supplying mobile toilets, building insulated tents for children and preparing food for people in the queues.  Save the Children is distributing essential supplies and winter kits of clothing and blankets, providing cash and financial assistance to families to meet basic needs such as food and medicines, and offering mental health support to children and their families. It suggests that a donation of £12 could help a victim of the violence access legal help or safe shelter.  The International Committee of the Red Cross is working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society to provide emergency assistance and support local hospitals and primary healthcare facilities with medical equipment. The URCS is also supporting local firefighters, medical and civil protection units and helping to repair vital infrastructure. Its volunteers are providing first aid training to 1,000 people in metro stations and bomb shelters. You can donate online.  Unicef has staff in the country in several locations and is helping to provide families with access to clean water and food, as well as psychosocial support for traumatised children, recreation kits and learning kits. “Needs are wide, ranging from hygiene products to blankets, gas burners and first aid kits,” Afshan Khan, the Unicef regional director for Europe and central Asia, says. ​In recent days, the charity said heavy weapons fire along the contact line in eastern Ukraine had damaged water infrastructure and schools. It estimates there are up to 7.5 million children in need of support and says a £46 donation will provide a family with an emergency water and hygiene kit. Donations can be made online or over the phone: 0300 330 5699.  Teams from the charity Médecins Sans Frontières are responding to medical and humanitarian needs as the conflict evolves. It has been providing training in emergency medicine and surgical preparedness to hospitals, as well as mass casualty kits with supplies for treating traumatic injuries. The charity is preparing more medical kits for rapid dispatch and has also sent additional emergency teams to the region, enabling it to assess the needs of Ukrainian refugees in Poland and neighbouring countries. You can donate online.  Cafod, the official aid agency for the Catholic church in England and Wales, is sending funds to Ukraine through the Caritas Internationalis aid network, which is running warm and safe “collective centres” that provide beds, food, washing facilities and safe spaces for children. Donate online.  World Jewish Relief has started transferring emergency funds to its 29 local partners in Ukraine. “We are prioritising food, cash, medical, material and psychological support for the worst affected,” a spokesperson says. In neighbouring countries, such as Moldova and Poland, the charity is supporting refugees with food, water, personal protective equipment and accommodation. You can donate online.  The World Health Organization is raising funds for its frontline response and to deliver life-saving medicines and supplies to people across Ukraine and to refugees. Across the UK, local communities are collecting items to deliver to Ukrainian refugees. Items typically sought include blankets, pillows, sleeping bags, bed linen, tents, warm and thermal clothing, first aid kits, bandages, painkillers, nappies, toiletries, torches with batteries, toothbrushes, toothpaste and toys. Local newspapers are reporting on drop-off points, so it is usually possible to find out where collections are taking place with a quick online search. Do check that items are still being collected before you attempt to donate anything as some drop-offs are now full and don’t have capacity to transport anything else across Europe. The White Eagle Club, a Polish social club in Balham, south London, has become a hub for donations in the capital. Last Monday, the first truck full of donations left for Poland, packed by volunteers. This week, as word about the club’s efforts spread on social media and Polish radio, donations have snowballed and vanloads of items are coming from across the UK. “So many places have called us and said I’m going to collect donations, get a van and bring it down to you,” says Krzysztof Gondek, the manager of the club. After requesting help with delivering these items from transportation companies, the club has managed to secure at least 30 more trucks to take these donated goods to Poland. Transporting donations across a post-Brexit Europe is a time-consuming process, the volunteers say, and they cannot take donations of food or liquid as a result. To ensure the donated items do not attract EU customs duties, the club is donating them all to the Polish arm of the charity Caritas, which is then going to distribute the items to the refugees arriving on the border. If you cannot find any local collections to donate to, an alternative option is to buy “survival items” from the online aid shop of the charity RefugEase. It sells food parcels, hygiene packs and medical packs. “The money you spend on buying items from our aid shop is ringfenced,” Valentina Osborn, the managing director of the charity, says. Each item is bought from a local retailer and delivered to a storeroom of the charity in Hungary. “These items are then driven to the Ukrainian border. In our opinion, it’s the most transparent and efficient method of donating towards a humanitarian crisis such as this,” she says. The online marketplace Etsy recently cancelled listing fees, transaction fees and advertising fees for its Ukraine-based sellers. Buying a digital file from a Ukrainian seller, such as a poster or an embroidery pattern, means they receive the money but do not have to post an item to you from the middle of a war zone. It is possible to look exclusively for items for sale from Ukrainian sellers on Etsy but it does require a bit of effort. You need to search using a keyword, then filter your search settings and choose “custom”, and then type Ukraine as the shop location. There are many other products for sale on Etsy that show solidarity with the Ukrainians or display the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Do not assume, however, that all these items are being sold by sellers from the country. Earlier this week, a Guardian reader, Jen Rouse, tried to use the site to buy a digital file from a Ukrainian seller to support them. She was alarmed to find many sellers – who were not Ukrainian – listing “Stand with Ukraine” branded items, without donating any money from the proceeds to the Ukrainian cause. “I think a lot of people will be buying these items to support Ukraine when they’re actually lining individual people’s pockets,” Rouse says. “It doesn’t feel right to me.” If you are a UK taxpayer, donating through Gift Aid means charities can claim an extra 25p for every £1 you give. The other good news is, if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you can claim the difference between the rate you pay and the basic rate on your donation through your self-assessment tax return or by asking HMRC to amend your tax code. For example, if you make a £10 donation to a charity, the charity can claim Gift Aid, pushing your donation up to £12.50. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you can then claim back £2.50, effectively reducing the cost of your donation to £7.50. Make sure you keep track of your donations as you make them, so you will have the details to hand when you fill in your tax return. There are rules you need to follow if you do want your donation to qualify for Gift Aid. First, you must pay income tax or capital gains tax to HMRC in the tax year in which you make your donation and second, you must give a declaration to each charity you want to donate to through Gift Aid, confirming that you do pay enough tax to qualify for the scheme. Finally, it is worth noting that your donations will not qualify if they are more than four times what you have paid in tax that year.",Lifestyle/Money,Ukraine crisis: how you can help from the UK by donating cash and supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/05/ukraine-crisis-how-you-can-help-donating-cash-supplies
3/5/2022,"Today is Nigo’s second day at school in a new country. She is eyes down, head to head with one of the specialist staff at the Bluecoat Beechdale academy in Nottingham, poring over an English text as her language skills are assessed. But Nigo – not her real name – isn’t new to the UK. She has been in Nottingham for 16 months since arriving here from Pakistan. “I applied to another school but they rejected me,” she says. “And my mother was sick, so then I stayed home and looked after her and my brothers.” Fortunately for Nigo, she did eventually make a successful application to Beechdale – but her experience is far from unique. Many of Nottingham’s secondary schools are full, and that presents real problems for pupils who arrive in the UK mid-year. Of five teenagers we meet in the school’s English as an additional language (EAL) department, not one has found a school place in less than six months. It’s a pressing issue. Waves of refugees have come to the city in the past few years from Syria, Afghanistan and Hong Kong, and it is now preparing for new arrivals from Ukraine. In a fragmented, academised system, no one has the power to force schools to take pupils, especially if they are already full. Nottingham’s director of education services, along with others from around England, is asking the Department for Education for assurances about the Ukrainian refugees: how will they be funded? And if some academies don’t want to take them, who will make them? Bluecoat Beechdale academy welcomes new arrivals, whether or not they are seeking asylum. It has recently become one of the first two schools in Nottingham to be designated Schools of Sanctuary, along with another in the same trust. That means it is now part of a national network of 300 schools recognised for their work in welcoming refugees and in raising awareness of the problems facing children in the asylum system. Facilities put in place here to support refugees, along with other new arrivals, have included buddies to help them settle in, a room for prayers during Ramadan and help with uniforms. The four pupils we meet alongside Nigo have all volunteered to be “ambassadors” for the School of Sanctuary. No distinctions are made here between refugee pupils and others, and we are not told which students are refugees. The four in the group are Hana, who is 14 and from Eritrea; Bita – not her real name – also 14 and from Iran; Abubaker, who is 13 and from Eritrea; and Angel, who’s 15 and was born in Italy, though her parents came from Ghana. There’s a sense that having initially been rejected by the education system is a part of their shared experience. “You have to apply and they take you through a year-long process,” Angel says. “Most schools reject you. I didn’t have a choice; you just have to go to the school that gets you admitted. Basically I stopped going to school in year 4, so I skipped two years of primary school and came straight to secondary school.” These four have had another common experience, too: in the absence of formal lessons, they learned English from a children’s channel called Tiny Pop TV. “It was frustrating and boring, you have to stay at home all day with nothing to do,” says Hana. “We didn’t know anything about social media, so we just used to watch TV stars and learn English from them.” The others all nod – singing along with the lyrics of songs was a big help, they say. As a result, at least they arrived in school with some of the English skills they should have been taught. There is a sense of companionship among the group, but the trust’s EAL coordinator, Cherry Pearce, is concerned others who should be here are stuck at home. She was approached recently by a local refugee charity, asking if she could provide teaching time or support for 28 Afghan children who have been living for months in hotel accommodation with their families, but she was already so overstretched she had to decline. The city has now found school places for all these pupils, but Pearce says the system is broken. “The process seems to be one where massive obstacles are in place. If we find there’s a child at home who doesn’t have a place we can report it, but that’s all we can do,” she says. Often they find out by chance that a child is out of school: “I had a student whose cousin was in our year 9, and they brought her to the year 6 induction day. We taught her until she was old enough to start secondary.” The problem is exercising the city’s senior education officials, along with their colleagues elsewhere. Nick Lee, the director of education services for Nottingham city council, is full of praise for the work of the Archdale Learning Trust, of which Beechdale and the city’s other School of Sanctuary, Bluecoat Aspley, are part. But he recognises there is a wider problem. The authority has faced challenges in ensuring refugee pupils are in school, he says. In the case of some people who have arrived from Hong Kong, it has been forced to pay for taxis to ferry them to schools under the neighbouring Nottinghamshire authority because their local schools are full. The city has also set up a unique facility to educate EAL pupils aged 14-18 after recognising they face particular problems: secondaries are reluctant to take pupils in GCSE years for fear of depressing their exam scores, and further education colleges cannot always meet the needs of those who arrive aged 16 or 17. Lee says: “Often the response from schools is that they are full. There’s a whole host of reasons for that, but where it stems from is the fact that the local authority has not been allowed to create new schools. When a child arrives in the city as a refugee, the schools are full. The lack of central coordination of in-year admissions is a huge headache, and means children do go under the radar.” Nottingham has a large, well-established Ukrainian community, so it is inevitable there will be new refugees arriving in the coming days and weeks. And Lee is concerned that the next group of refugees should not have to face the same problems as their predecessors. “We still have pockets of really poor practice, and that’s what we are trying to root out and work through,” he says. “I will be talking to the DfE, and will be very strongly making the point that our secondary capacity is really, really challenged. “Our heart goes out to them, and we want absolutely to respond and to be part of the solution. But we need help. And others will be saying exactly the same.” Specifically, he says schools will need extra funding because they do not automatically receive money for children who arrive after an annual census date in January. And he would like to be able to work with the regional schools commissioner to direct academy schools to take pupils where necessary. The DfE chose not to respond to his comments. In a statement, it said: “We stand with Ukraine, and we have been working at pace to launch the Ukraine family scheme, allowing families to be reunited. We are working swiftly across government to help local authorities provide the support needed for those who arrive from Ukraine.” Back at Beechdale, Pearce fears there must already be other children in the city who have been turned down by secondary schools and who do not know where to turn. “Unless you know who to contact, the system must be completely impossible to negotiate,” she says. “It’s terrifying to think who might be slipping through the net.”",News/Education,"Ukraine refugees may struggle to find places in English schools, councils say",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/05/ukraine-refugees-may-struggle-to-find-places-in-english-schools-councils-say
