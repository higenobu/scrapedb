A shopping centre in Kyiv was shelled on Monday night in the Podilskyi district, killing at least six people. Missiles struck military training grounds in the northwestern city of Rivne. Shelling at a chemical plant in the north-eastern city of Sumy caused an ammonia leak.

Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/21/2022,"Travelling from one end of Tate Britain to the other, bright, multicoloured figures are on parade as part of a major new public installation that addresses urgent contemporary issues including the climate emergency, Black Lives Matter and the invasion of Ukraine. Unveiled on Monday, The Procession by Hew Locke is made up of 150 life-sized figures staging a powerful and unsettling procession. Intricately handmade, with an abundance of bold colours, the figures represent people of all ages traveling from one end of the gallery to the other, through geography, time and culture. It sparks ideas of pilgrimage, migration, trade, carnival, protest, social celebrations as well as our own individual journey through life. “The refugee crisis, the climate emergency and colonialism are, to a certain extent, eternal themes,” Locke said. “These concerns are concerns I’ve had for a very long time. And it seems that tragically they’ll always be with us. We have a current situation we’re looking at in the news every day, and it’s traumatic.” Locke’s figures carry historical and cultural baggage with them on their journey. Costumes and flags bear images of decaying Guyanese architecture, evidence of rising sea levels, cargo and sail boats, tropical prints and slave ships. There are several reworked and painted over copies of now defunct share certificates – an area the artist has been exploring for more than two decades. “The refugee crisis is represented in a Greek share certificate, which was a Greek government refugee loan in 1924 following the Turkish-Greek war. I’ve been using these things to talk about the refugee crisis including the refugee camps in Greece following the war in Syria. There are still people getting on rickety boats today.” Locke’s installation takes as its starting point the architecture and history of the gallery itself, and its founding benefactor - sugar refining magnate Henry Tate. “Sugar has a dark and difficult history. The piece is tailored for this space, if I was showing in another venue, I may be showing something slightly different.” One of the pieces in the Tate collection that Locke has incorporated into his work is The Death of Major Peirson, which celebrates the British defence of Jersey against French invasion in 1781 and pays tribute to a young major who lost his life. “The central figure in this painting is a black marksman, and next to him is this dying major, his master. It’s a very complicated painting, because this black guy was probably never there. He’s there as a symbol of loyalty of the colonies to the crown.” The Procession is the latest in Tate Britain’s ongoing series of annual commissions in its Duveen galleries. Elena Crippa, senior curator of modern and contemporary British art, said it was made by modelling cardboard, sewing custom-printed fabrics, adapting new and secondhand clothes and assembling found and cast elements. “As the project grew in scale, the number of associations Hew brought to the commission, encompassing personal memories and references to historical events, also grew,” she said. “Hew’s aim was always to be able to make enough figures to create a strong sense of presence in the large Duveen galleries at Tate Britain and the scale of his work is extraordinary. “The figures also needed to be convincing to give a sense of the liveliness and movement of a collective gathering or procession.” Locke said he hoped the piece would inspire people to “question things a bit more … how did we get here, the complex cities of history, the messiness of history”. “The figures are moving as if they’re going with a direction, but we don’t know where their ultimate destination is. We can’t see the future, we’re certainly finding that out right now. So they’re walking into a sort of cinematic fadeout, to appear again somewhere else.” Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain, said: “The Procession is a powerful body of work that reflects on globalisation, colonialism, conflict, ecology and cultural identity. “Alongside our Life Between Islands exhibition, this has been an exciting year of celebrating Caribbean British artists at Tate Britain, underscoring our commitment to showcase are that is reflective of the cross-cultural society we service.”",Arts/Art and design,Hew Locke’s Procession brings colour and conflict to Tate Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/21/hew-lockes-procession-brings-colour-and-conflict-to-tate-britain
3/21/2022,"No, the war in Ukraine is not like Brexit. No, the Russians are not Nazis, nor are the Ukrainians. No, Boris Johnson is not Churchill or Pericles, and the third world war has not begun, unless we choose to begin it. Such comparisons are odious. As a guide to the present, let alone the future, history is for smart alecks and podcasts. It is bunk. The only quarrel I have with Ukraine’s astonishing resistance to Russia is with its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s, recourse to historical parallels. It is understandable that Ukraine should want to browbeat Nato into joining its cause against Russia. Its struggle is existential. But to summon images of Europe’s blood-drenched 20th century is no way to do it. As for Johnson portraying the Kremlin as on a par with the EU – an organisation Ukraine wants to join – it is like having a playground idiot running the country. Most wars are the result of history distorted and harnessed to the cause of some individual or group ambition, greed or pride. Vladimir Putin was able to characterise his previous incursions into Crimea and Donbas as having their roots in local politics. The invasion of Ukraine seems a personal obsession, based on his reading of history and requiring oppression and massive deception of the Russian people to maintain consent. That deception has embraced constant parallels with Nato’s “shock and awe” bombing of Baghdad in 2003 – a parallel that seems to have been too much for western censors of Moscow’s RT channel to stand. History warned Nato in 1989 not to test Russia’s paranoia after its defeat in the cold war by advancing to its borders in the Baltic states. Nato ignored that warning. Today it has read history differently and has wisely refused to join its forces with Ukraine. It has declined Putin’s invitation to validate his view of Nato as the aggressor. In doing so, it has had to endure a barrage of hawkish parallels with 1938 appeasement. But the US president, Joe Biden, is not Neville Chamberlain. Nor is Putin Hitler or Napoleon or Stalin. Comparing any dictator to Hitler is enticing, but the enticement is to allow emotion to swamp reason. We may have to await psychologists to explain Putin’s present actions, but we are living in 2022, not the 1930s. Nothing is more disastrous than giving history primacy over geography. History is subjective and selective. Geography is fact, truly the queen of sciences. Just as Ukraine has always been a victim of its geography, so too may be Russia as Putin’s quest for historic glory grinds to a halt in the mud of the great European plain. And while Nato remains a creature of 20th-century history, at least its strategists have looked at the map. They have understood that Russia’s border with Ukraine is no place to start a wider war that would unquestionably be without parallel.

3/21/2022,"Egypt has fixed the price of unsubsidised bread amid a global surge in wheat prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The move comes after war shut off access to cheaper wheat from the Black Sea region, particularly affecting exports to the Middle East and north African region. Egypt is the world’s biggest wheat importer, bringing in about 60% of its grain from overseas. Russia and Ukraine accounted for 80% of the country’s imports last year. The Egyptian prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, set the price of commercially sold bread at 11.50 Egyptian pounds a kilo on Monday, which is 49 British pence. The new fixed price for flat, round balady bread weighing 90g has been set at 1.00 Egyptian pounds. Concern about supplies of wheat had already pushed up the price of bread, which is a food staple in Egypt, by as much as a quarter is some bakeries, to 1.25 Egyptian pounds a loaf, while flour prices were up about 15%, Attia Hamad from the Cairo chamber of commerce told Reuters. Steep rises in food prices have previously caused political unrest in Egypt and other countries including Bangladesh and Indonesia. In 2007 and 2008, shortages caused by droughts in key wheat and rice-producing countries and a surge in energy costs led to riots in more than 40 nations around the world. Last week, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warned there was a danger of severe hunger, as the war in Ukraine threatened supplies of key staple crops. Ukraine alone supplied 12% of global wheat before the war, and was the biggest producer of sunflower oil. About two-thirds of the country’s wheat exports had been delivered before the invasion, but the rest is now blocked. There are fears that farmers will be unable to continue with spring planting, or take in grain harvests in the summer, if the fighting continues. Wheat prices hit record highs last week, although they have since fallen back slightly. Alongside the concerns about wheat production and exports from Russia and Ukraine, the price of basic foodstuffs such as sunflower oil has also soared, while the price of urea, a key nitrogen fertiliser, has more than tripled in the past year, because of the rising cost of energy, a key input.",News/World news,Egypt fixes price of unsubsidised bread as Ukraine war hits wheat supply,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/egypt-fixes-price-of-unsubsidised-bread-as-ukraine-war-hits-wheat-supply
3/21/2022,"The veteran Conservative MP Sir David Amess was murdered in a terrorist assassination by an Islamist who also scouted the home of Michael Gove and another MP as he plotted an attack, a court has heard. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, denies the murder of Amess, 69, on 15 October 2021 as the MP held a constituency surgery in a church in Essex. Opening the case before the jury at the Old Bailey, Tom Little QC for the prosecution, said Ali had bought the knife he used to stab Amess five years earlier. With Ali in the dock, Little told the jury the defendant had carried out a “cold and calculated murder”. Little said Ali had carried out the murder “because of a warped and twisted and violent ideology. It was a murder carried out by a young man who for many years had been planning just such an attack and who was, and is, a committed, fanatical, radicalised Islamist terrorist.” Amess was attacked in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, as he held an advice surgery for those from his Southend West constituency. Ali travelled from his north London home having lied to get an appointment: “The defendant tricked his way into meeting Sir David Amess by pretending to be one of his constituents when he was not.” The jury was told Ali traveled across London and on to Essex, armed with the knife he would use. Little said: “This was nothing less than an assassination for terrorist purposes. It is a crime to which, we say, he has no defence.” Ali also denies preparing terrorists attacks, which Little said he had been planning since May 2019. “He had for a number of years been determined to carry out an act of domestic terrorism,” he said. “To that end, from at least May 2019 he researched and planned potential attacks on members of parliament and the Houses of Parliament. “This included specific reconnaissance trips to a constituency surgery of Mike Freer MP and to the home address of Michael Gove MP. That researching and planning is the other offence he faces namely preparing for acts of terrorism.” Amess had been an MP since 1983 with 38 years’ service in parliament. On 27 September 2021, Ali sent an email to Amess’s constituency office to try and get an appointment, pretending to be interested in Christianity and to live in the Southend area. The trial continues.",News/UK news,"Man accused of murdering David Amess scouted home of Michael Gove, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/ali-harbi-ali-accused-murdering-david-amess-scouted-home-michael-gove-court-hears
