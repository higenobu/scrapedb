1/11/2022,"With the Premier League title race already close to being a foregone conclusion, Manchester City could be considering a proper victory-lap signing to rub it all in: none other than 2018’s Luka Modric. With the Croatia midfielder yet to agree a new deal with Real Madrid for when his contract expires this summer, El Nacional reports that the 36-year-old is “tired of being underestimated” by the club’s modest and unassuming head honcho Florentino Pérez. And in the wings Pep Guardiola is reportedly prepared to welcome Modric with “open arms”. Liverpool may have suggested they’re not keen to splash out but it looks like they might have rustled up a few bob to wave in the direction of Seville for the defender Jules Koundé, Rumours are that the Reds are prepared to cough up and activate the £75m release clause for the French defender, who has won seven caps for his country. Liverpool may face competition from Chelsea and Real Madrid, who are also sniffing around the 23-year-old.  Talking of Chelsea, their defender Antonio Rüdiger is the subject of interest from PSG and Real Madrid. Madrid are thought to be Rüdiger’s preferred destination but the French league leaders are reportedly prepared to pay the Germany defender €7m after tax, so which will win out in this romantic tale? Today’s Newcastle rumour puts Bayer Leverkusen’s Patrik Schick on their radar as they step up that search for a striker, any striker, to solve their goalscoring problems. It would cost around £50m to spring the Czech Republic striker from the Bundesliga, but money’s not the main issue here. Also linked with the Toon is Stephen Bergwijn, whose people are said to be sizing up loan options away from Tottenham, with Ajax also interested. On the subject of getting out of N17, Tanguy Ndombele not fancying it against Morecambe and being assailed by a cacophony of boos when substituted seems to have alerted a number of European suitors to his potential availability. Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona, Milan, Roma and Lyon have all been linked with the Tottenham midfielder. Going the other way could be Milan’s Franck Kessié, with Spurs apparently leading the hunt for the Ivory Coast midfielder. Meanwhile plucky, cash-strapped Barcelona continue to be linked with an inordinate range of targets, some likelier than others. There has been plenty of talk that Xavi Hernández is interested in snapping up Álvaro Morata from Atlético Madrid, though the Barça manager has waved it away as a mere “hypothesis”. Meanwhile, TNT Sports claims the former Chelsea playmaker Oscar, currently at Shanghai Port FC, is also a target for the Catalans. In the WSL, Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema is subject of interest from PSG and all-conquering Barcelona, with the Dutch striker’s contract expiring in the summer, but Arsenal are keen to keep her and Miedema has suggested she’s open to staying. And that’s all the weather. Only 20 more days to churn through.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Luka Modric set for Manchester City move?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/football-transfer-rumours-luka-modric-set-for-manchester-city-move
1/11/2022,"A health minister has admitted the public will be “upset and angry” at revelations that a senior official invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party during the first lockdown. In a tacit acknowledgment of the strength of feeling at the latest revelations, Ed Argar said he had personally not attended any parties and had been aware of the regulations, “not least because I was a health minister who’d helped draw them up”.  It came as the former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson called for an immediate explanation from Boris Johnson, after No 10 and ministers said any comment must wait for the conclusion of civil servant Sue Gray’s investigation into Downing Street lockdown breaches. “This line won’t survive 48 hrs. Nobody needs an official to tell them if they were at a boozy shindig in their own garden. People are (rightly) furious. They sacrificed so much – visiting sick or grieving relatives, funerals. What tf were any of these people thinking?” Davidson tweeted. Labour’s shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said it was the most serious allegation to date. “The reason this is so damning is because it was an organised party, no ifs and no buts, because it was clearly the most flagrant violation of the rules,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “The prime minister cannot run and he cannot hide. He’s got to answer. If I went to a party, I know I went to the party. He’s got to explain - was he at the party? How can he possibly justify all of the things he said in the House of Commons – that no rules were broken, that he did nothing wrong? He is going to have to answer.” Argar told Sky News that he understood public anger after the email from senior official Martin Reynolds inviting staff to enjoy drinks in the garden was unearthed by ITN. The Met police have said they will make inquiries. About 30 to 40 people are said to have attended, with food and wine set out on tables, but some staff reportedly expressed reservations at the time. On the same day, Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, had reminded the public at a press conference: “You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay two metres apart.” Argar told Sky News: “I can understand that with these allegations people will be upset and angry, which is why it’s right that the Prime Minister asked for that independent investigation to be completed at pace, to get to the facts behind these allegations. What actually happened or didn’t happen in Downing Street is a matter for Ms Gray. “She will come up with her conclusions having interviewed the relevant people, having looked at the evidence and ... she will then conclude a) what did or didn’t happen, and then b) whether anything that did happen was consistent with the rules.” Asked if he would have attended a party himself, Argar said: “I spent my May last year talking to you on various occasions, and various other media outlets, but pretty much glued to my Zoom screen and making sure that I knew what the regulations were – not least because I was a health minister who’d helped draw them up.” “I wasn’t invited to any parties and I’m not going to get into any hypotheticals. … I was clear about what the rules were at the time and it’s right that Sue Gray is looking into this matter independently.” But Argar admitted he might have had a “quiet word” with neighbours holding a party for 40 people. “But I’m not going to extrapolate from that or be drawn on the allegations at the moment.”",News/Politics,Health minister admits public will be ‘angry’ over No 10 lockdown party,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/health-minister-admits-public-will-be-angry-over-no-10-lockdown-party
1/11/2022,"For long winter nights, Joanna Ruth Meyer’s lush, folkloric debut Echo North (Pushkin, £8.99) is certain to enchant. In a Russian-inspired fantasy world, Echo makes a pact with a strange talking wolf: she will live for a year in his house and in exchange the wolf will save her father’s life. There, she finds secrets, danger, a magical library and the mystery of the wolf’s enchantment to unravel. Immersive and romantic, it’s a unique spin on fairytales such as East of the Sun and West of the Moon and Beauty and the Beast.  There are more fairytales in Natasha Bowen’s epic debut Skin of the Sea (Penguin, £7.99), which fuses The Little Mermaid with west African mythology. Simi, a young black mermaid, is one of the Mami Wata, duty-bound to gather the souls of those who die at sea. When a living boy is thrown from a slave ship, Simi defies the decree to save his life and must travel to the supreme creator to make her amends. Fantastical creatures and vengeful gods form a vivid backdrop to this rich and original story of one girl’s journey to find herself. Also challenging stereotypical depictions of enslaved people in fiction is Alex Wheatle’s Kemosha of the Caribbean (Andersen Press, £7.99, February), which puts a young black girl centre stage in a thrilling high seas adventure set in 1650s Jamaica. Born into slavery and sold to work in the colonial outpost of Port Royal, Kemosha escapes aboard the ship of notorious pirate Captain Morgan, eager to earn enough to buy her brother’s freedom. Kemosha’s indomitable spirit, determination and wit make for an unforgettable heroine. In Blue Running by Lori Ann Stephens (Moonflower, £16.99), the near future has spawned the violent and corrupt Republic of Texas, where gun ownership is mandatory, abortion illegal and the country isolated from the US by both a wall and an internet blackout. When a firearms accident kills Bluebonnet’s best friend, she goes on the run, joining up with Jet, a pregnant Latin American migrant. Their race to the border is gripping. Can you trust everything you read in a newspaper? In contemporary fiction, Muhammad Khan’s Mark My Words (Macmillan, £7.99, February) explores the impact of two very different schools merging into one. Frustrated by elite student cliques and the glossy, official school newspaper, Dua sets up an alternative to highlight social inequalities exposed by the merger, along with controversies the school would prefer to keep quiet. A bold and timely book about protest and finding your voice. Finally, Kate Weston’s Diary of a Confused Feminist, one of the funniest young adult books of recent years, continues in a sequel, Must Do Better (Hodder, £7.99, February). It’s a new term and Kat is determined to spread the word about her feminist society and support her friends through difficult times, And there’s a class trip to France to look forward to. These astutely observed misadventures echo the much-missed teen writer Louise Rennison in a frank, contemporary take on sex, relationships and mental health.

1/11/2022,"The world’s oceans have been set to simmer, and the heat is being cranked up. Last year saw the hottest ocean temperatures in recorded history, the sixth consecutive year that this record has been broken, according to new research. The heating up of our oceans is being primarily driven by the human-caused climate crisis, scientists say, and represents a starkly simple indicator of global heating. While the atmosphere’s temperature is also trending sharply upwards, individual years are less likely to be record-breakers compared with the warming of the oceans.  Last year saw a heat record for the top 2,000 meters of all oceans around the world, despite an ongoing La Niña event, a periodic climatic feature that cools waters in the Pacific. The 2021 record tops a stretch of modern record-keeping that goes back to 1955. The second hottest year for oceans was 2020, while the third hottest was 2019. “The ocean heat content is relentlessly increasing, globally, and this is a primary indicator of human-induced climate change,” said Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado and co-author of the research, published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences. Warmer ocean waters are helping supercharge storms, hurricanes and extreme rainfall, the paper states, which is escalating the risks of severe flooding. Heated ocean water expands and eats away at the vast Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which are collectively shedding around 1tn tons of ice a year, with both of these processes fueling sea level rise. Oceans take up about a third of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity, causing them to acidify. This degrades coral reefs, home to a quarter of the world’s marine life and the provider of food for more than 500m people, and can prove harmful to individual species of fish. As the world warms from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and other activities, the oceans have taken the brunt of the extra heat. More than 90% of the heat generated over the past 50 years has been absorbed by the oceans, temporarily helping spare humanity, and other land-based species, from temperatures that would already be catastrophic. The amount of heat soaked up by the oceans is enormous. Last year, the upper 2,000 meters of the ocean, where most of the warming occurs, absorbed 14 more zettajoules (a unit of electrical energy equal to one sextillion joules) than it did in 2020. This amount of extra energy is 145 times greater than the world’s entire electricity generation which, by comparison, is about half of a zettajoule. Long-term ocean warming is strongest in the Atlantic and Southern oceans, the new research states, although the north Pacific has had a “dramatic” increase in heat since 1990 and the Mediterranean Sea posted a clear high temperature record last year. The heating trend is so pronounced it’s clear to ascertain the fingerprint of human influence in just four years of records, according to John Abraham, another of the study’s co-authors. “Ocean heat content is one of the best indicators of climate change,” added Abraham, an expert in thermal sciences at University of St Thomas. “Until we reach net zero emissions, that heating will continue, and we’ll continue to break ocean heat content records, as we did this year,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University and another of the 23 researchers who worked on the paper. “Better awareness and understanding of the oceans are a basis for the actions to combat climate change.”",News/Environment,Hottest ocean temperatures in history recorded last year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/oceans-hottest-temperatures-research-climate-crisis
1/11/2022,"Newcastle are trying to sign the 19-year-old striker Hugo Ekitike from Reims but the French club intend to reject their opening proposal. Reims value Ekitike at about €30m (£25m) and want a sell-on clause in any deal for the player, who has come through their ranks.  West Ham are among other clubs interested in Ekitike but Newcastle’s pursuit of the France Under-20 international is the most advanced. Ekitike has scored eight goals and provided two assists in 17 Ligue 1 appearances this season in a team 14th in the table. He made his first-team debut in October 2020. Newcastle, who have one win this season and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Cambridge United, last week signed Kieran Trippier from Atlético Madrid as they try to bolster their squad under their Saudi Arabian-led owners. A striker is high on their agenda because of a calf injury to Callum Wilson, who in a best-case scenario will be out for several more weeks. Chelsea are continuing attempts to bring back Emerson Palmieri from his loan at Lyon by offering about €4m in compensation.

1/11/2022,"Health officials have clarified that the recommended Covid self-isolation period in the US is shorter than in the UK at a time when the prime minister is considering reducing it to five days. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) previously said the isolation period was in effect the same in both countries. It said the recommended minimum of six full days in the UK was counted from the onset of symptoms, while in the US, the five-day isolation began from the day of a positive test, which could be several days after the first symptoms.  However, the UKHSA has updated its blogpost, which now states: “In the UK our advice is to self-isolate for at least six full days from the point at which you have symptoms or get a positive test, whichever is first.” It continued: “In the United States, the advice is to isolate for at least five full days from the same point.” The blogpost concludes: “We believe that allowing people to leave self-isolation after two negative lateral flow tests on days six and seven is the optimal approach at present. This supports people who are unlikely to be infectious to go back to work and resume other activities, but continues to protect the wider population from infection. The UKHSA said it made the correction after the US CDC health protection agency clarified that its isolation period started when symptoms first appeared. The CDC cut the recommended isolation period there to five days in December. Boris Johnson has been facing calls from MPs and business bosses to follow suit in the UK in order to help ease staff absences across the economy and public services. On Monday, the prime minister said he would “act according to the science” on potentially reducing the time period to five days. The period has already been cut from 10 days to seven, as long as the person in isolation has negative lateral flow test results, and Johnson’s official spokesman said “if it is possible to go further then we will do so”. The UKHSA is leading work on the issue along with the government’s Covid taskforce based in the Cabinet Office. On the change to its blogpost, a UKHSA spokesperson said: “We updated our blog following clarification from the CDC on their isolation guidance on 4 January.” On Sunday, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said it would be “helpful” to cut the isolation period to five days because of the pressures on the UK’s workforce.",News/World news,UK health officials backtrack on US Covid isolation comparison,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/uk-health-officials-backtrack-on-us-covid-isolation-comparison
