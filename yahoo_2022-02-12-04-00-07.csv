The problem is that she has realized that starting Social Security early reduced the benefit significantly, and she’d been wondering if it was possible to increase her benefit. “But that’s over the earnings limit”, Sue told me.",Business/MarketWatch,I took Social Security at 62 and now regret it.

2/12/2022,"A man accused of a brutal baseball bat attack against a Chinese woman in Seattle’s Belltown neighborhood has been charged with assault on Friday, according to reports.

The incident, which was caught on surveillance video, occurred in the 200 block of Cedar Street at around 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 31, as per The Seattle Times.

The victim, whose name has not been officially released by authorities, was walking home from work when 31-year-old Wantez Jamel Tulloss allegedly struck her head with a baseball bat from behind.

In the video, the suspect can be seen dropping two bags in his right hand so that he could use both hands to hit Wang with the bat.
 


Police responded to a 911 call and found Wang lying on the sidewalk with a bloodied right ear. She sustained skull fractures that required “significant surgery.”

Tulloss allegedly roamed around after the attack and even treated himself to a slice of pizza, according to the New York Post. He then returned to his apartment, a transitional housing facility around 500 feet (152.40 meters) from the scene of the incident.



Tulloss has been charged with first-degree assault. It is unclear exactly when he was arrested, but he remains at the Kings County Correctional Facility on a $150,000 bail as of Wednesday. If convicted, he could receive a prison sentence of up to 12 years, as well as 36 months of community custody.

“The randomness, the viciousness of it. It’s absolutely disturbing that’s why we rush filed [sic] the case,” said Casey McNerthney of the King County Prosecutor’s Office, as per KOMO News. “This video is nauseating, it’s awful to watch. But we have prosecutors who are doing everything they can to hold this person accountable and we’re going to keep doing it whether it’s this case or other cases.”

Washington State courts have reportedly issued 11 warrants for Tulloss’ arrest since 2012. He has been convicted of nine misdemeanors and two felonies for robbery and breaking into private property. According to investigators, Tulloss currently has a warrant for theft in the third degree out of the Kirkland Municipal Court.

Wang, who works at Amazon, told police that she has family members in China. An investigation of the incident and the suspect’s motives is underway.

NextShark has reached out to the King County Prosecutor’s Office for further comment on the attack.

2/12/2022,"Sen. Ted Cruz says ""left-wing educators"" are putting ""explicit pornography in front of kids."" His comments come as Texas schools and libraries face ""unprecedented"" book challenges. Texas State Teachers Association says Cruz is trying to appeal to the ""far right of the right wing."" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says ""left-wing educators"" are introducing children to ""explicit pornography"" in schools as parents and conservative politicians in his state target books on racism and sexuality as inappropriate for public schools and libraries. When asked what he meant, Cruz would not cite particular examples of pornographic content in schools, but instead pointed to books that have made parents angry at school board meetings in general. ""Take a look at some of the portions from books that parents are going to school boards and reading out loud; this is what my child is being taught,'"" he told Insider during an interview at the US Capitol. ""And in too many instances, you have left-wing educators putting explicit pornography in front of kids. I think that is severely misguided."" Representatives of state teachers and library associations dispute Cruz's assertion about pornography in schools, with one person calling such suggestions ""baloney."" Battles over what books are suitable for children in school libraries are playing out in several states with conservative politicians seizing on the issue in an appeal to their base and concerned parents. In Tennessee, the McMinn County Board of Education in January removed the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus, about the holocaust, from its 8th-grade language arts curriculum ""because of its unnecessary use of profanity and nudity and its depiction of violence and suicide."" In Mississippi, a mayor reportedly withheld funds from his city's library because LGBTQ books were on the shelves. Texas, meanwhile, has become a leader in these fights. In October, state Rep. Matt Krause, a Republican, launched an investigation into Texas school district content, inquiring about 850 books that include titles dealing with race and sexuality. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called for criminal charges against anyone providing ""pornography"" to students. In Central Texas, the Llano County Library shut down for three days in December at the behest of county commissioners for a ""thorough review"" of every children's book in the library. A San Antonio school district in December launched a review of more than 400 books for age appropriateness. For Texas schools and public libraries, the challenges to books deemed inappropriate by some on topics of race, racism, sexual identity, and orientation — depicting the experiences through the lens of individuals in underrepresented groups — have been ""unprecedented,"" the Texas Library Association said a statement to Insider. ""Books dealing with these subjects are being called for review, or 'challenge or reconsideration' in our libraries in record numbers due, in part, to the recent attempts to mislabel certain content under the theme of Critical Race Theory,"" the association added. Cruz told Insider that a school choosing to teach one book instead of another isn't book banning, which he said is wrong and unconstitutional, but ""simply making the choices that are inherent in education."" ""I don't believe schools should be teaching explicit pornography to kids and advocates on the left that want schools to teach explicit pornography to kids are far out of the mainstream,"" he said. ""I think most moms and most dads don't want their elementary school teaching pornography to their children. They want them teaching, reading and writing, and math history."" Cruz in 2017 infamously sparked a social media frenzy when his Twitter account liked a tweet with pornographic content. Cruz blamed it on an accident by a staffer. Responding to Cruz's comments about ""left-wing educators,"" Clay Robison, a spokesperson for the Texas State Teachers Association, told Insider ""I'm not aware of any explicit pornography that any teachers – left wing, right wing or middle of the road – are deliberately exposing school students to in Texas."" Gov. Abbott has tried to suggest that ""pornographic materials are rampant in Texas public schools,"" Robison said. ""That's baloney,"" he added. He said Cruz is like Abbott, trying to appeal to the ""far right of the right wing."" ""I find it far more pornographic that senator Cruz played a part in trying to overturn a fair and legitimate election in 2020,"" Robison said, referring to Cruz's objections to certifying election results. The Texas Library Association also called the issue ""concocted to find a solution to a problem that doesn't exist."" ""Proponents of banning books would have you believe that children are being subjected to pornographic materials in school libraries, that simply is not the case,"" the association said. ""TLA believes that parents have the right to decide what their children read, but nobody has the right to make those decisions for everyone's children."" During interviews at the Capitol on Thursday, several Democratic senators said it's important for students to learn unvarnished truths about the country. ""Every day doesn't have to be Disney World,"" said Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a member of the Senate Health, Education Labor and Pensions Committee. ""Our kids are smarter and more capable of understanding nuance than folks think."" Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, another Senate HELP Committee member, said ""it's a terrible thing to do, to start banning books,"" and librarians and administrators should be trusted to offer age-appropriate literature for children. ""I think the whole book banning movement is ill-conceived,"" he told Insider. When asked about the topic in December, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas referenced the Texas state legislator's complaint and said he understood the concern. ""I'm confident we're not going to ban age-appropriate books for students. But I don't see anything wrong with reviewing,"" he told Insider.

2/12/2022,"Prosecutors have dropped the case against a former John A. Ferguson Senior High School history teacher who was accused of having a sexual relationship with a student, citing a lack of evidence. The Miami-Dade’s State Attorney’s Office on Thursday closed the case against Aaron Hamid, 27, saying they couldn’t “prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt,” court records show. “Based on the lack of physical evidence, the victim’s refusal to cooperate and provide a sworn statement, lack of digital evidence with any hearsay exceptions, and no statements from the defendant the State would not be able to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt,” Assistant State Attorney Kelly Hartman wrote in a memorandum dated Thursday. The investigation into Hamid began on Oct. 22 when the student’s best friend told school officials and police about the sexual relationship. The student confirmed the relationship to police, and in November, Hamid turned himself in to police and was arrested, according to his arrest affidavit. He was charged with three felony counts, including offenses against students by authority figures, unlawful sexual activity with a specified minor and engaging in a sexual act with a familial child. Hartman’s memorandum notes the student, during a sworn statement, declined to answer questions about the “sexual nature of her relationship with the defendant.” “The victim made it clear that she had no intention of participating in prosecuting this defendant and would not provide any information,” Hartman wrote. The victim’s phone was “forensically examined” in an attempt to retrieve evidence, according to the memorandum. While conversations referencing the relationship were found, no “inappropriate direct conversations between the victim and the defendant could be viewed,” the memorandum states. Hartman notes it appeared numerous conversations were deleted but examiners were unable to retrieve them. Hamid had been employed four years by Miami-Dade’s public school district and had no prior disciplinary history. He was reassigned from the school during the investigation, and when he was arrested, the school district said it planned to terminate his employment and prevent him from seeking future work with Miami-Dade County Public Schools. Miami-Dade County Public Schools did not immediately respond to a Miami Herald inquiry on whether the district would rehire Hamid.",U.S./Miami Herald,Prosecutors drop case of Ferguson High teacher accused of sex with a student,https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutors-drop-case-ferguson-high-172940385.html
2/12/2022,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency on Friday, February 11, in response to a blockade led by protesters opposing vaccine mandates at a border crossing that connects Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, Michigan. Ford made the announcement on the fifth day of the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge, which is an offshoot of the “Freedom Convoy” protests that have centered on the Canadian capital of Ottawa. This footage from Aileen Ward, who took part in the protests, shows demonstrators on a roadway in Windsor on Thursday evening, before Ford’s announcement. In a press conference Friday morning, Ford said an Ontario court had allowed his government to freeze funds being channeled to the protesters, and said temporary orders were being enacted that could see protesters facing fines of up to $100,000 and up to one year in prison. Ford said “$700 billion of two-way trade” crossed the Ambassador Bridge every day, and that the blockade was affecting “millions of families.” The right to protest, Ford said, “cannot extend to cutting off that lifeline.” Ford said the “vast majority” of participants had protested peacefully and went home, and said their concerns had been “heard loud and clear.” However, he accused those continuing to protest at the Ambassador Bridge of denying “hundreds of thousands” of Ontario residents the right to work, and said the demonstrators in Ottawa were laying “siege” to the city. “I call it a siege, because that’s what it is. It’s an illegal occupation,” Ford said. On Thursday, Michigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer called on Canadian authorities to “reopen traffic on the bridge,” which she said was the “busiest land border crossing in North America.” Whitmer said the blockade was having a “significant impact on Michigan’s working families who are just trying to do their jobs.” Credit: Aileen Ward via Storyful",Politics/Storyful,Ontario Premier Declares 'State of Emergency' in Response to Border Blockade,https://news.yahoo.com/ontario-premier-declares-state-emergency-184823077.html
2/12/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — An early look at the performance of COVID-19 booster shots during the recent omicron wave in the U.S. showed a decline in effectiveness against severe cases, though the shots still offered strong protection. The report, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, is considered an early and limited look at the durability of booster protection during the omicron surge that exploded in December and January but has been fading in recent weeks. The researchers looked at patient visits to hospitals and urgent care centers in 10 states. They estimated how well the booster prevented COVID-related visits to emergency departments and urgent care centers, and how well the vaccines prevented hospitalizations. About 10% of people in the study were boosted. Vaccine effectiveness was higher in people who had received boosters than in people who had received only the original series of shots. But researchers also found that during the time that the omicron variant has been predominant, vaccine effectiveness against outpatient visits was 87% in people who had gotten a booster two months earlier, but to 66% at four months after. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization fell from 91% at two months to 78% by the fourth month. Those results, however, were based on only a small number of patients — fewer than 200 — who had been boosted four months earlier at the time of the omicron wave. And it's unclear if those people had gotten boosters early for medical reasons that may have made them more vulnerable to severe illness. Health experts expect protection from the vaccines to wane. The U.S. booster campaign was based on evidence that emerged last year that vaccine protection was fading months after people got their initial vaccinations. Still, that kind of finding was unforeseen, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert. “I’m a little surprised, according to the data, that it’s starting to wane already,"" he said, adding that he would have anticipated higher estimates of vaccine effectiveness at the four-month post-booster mark. But Schaffner also said he'd like to see more research abut the durability of booster protection, adding “let’s take this with a grain of salt.” ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
