2/21/2022,"Spanish police have recovered the final piece of a 17th-century tapestry that was stolen 42 years ago by a notorious art thief. The 4-metre by 6.5-metre tapestry, known as La apoteosis de las artes (The Apotheosis of the Arts), was one of six Flemish tapestries taken from the church of Santo Domingo in the town of Castrojeriz in northern Spain, in the early hours of 7 November 1980.  The pieces, – which were made in Bruges in 1654 by Corneille Schutz, a follower of Rubens – were stolen by René Alphonse van den Berghe, better known to the Spanish public as Erik the Belgian. While all six tapestries were recovered after an Interpol-led investigation in Spain, France and Belgium, a lower lefthand section of The Apotheosis of the Arts depicting a cherub had been feared lost for more than four decades. Van den Berghe, a Belgian art dealer, died in Málaga in 2020 at the age of 80. The fragment was found after Ángel Alcaraz, a police officer engaged in an academic study of art thefts, got in touch with Van den Berghe’s lawyer and managed to establish its whereabouts. The lawyer handed over the piece and it was returned to the archdiocese of Burgos last Friday. “If heaven should lack one angel it would be a lesser heaven,” said Alcaraz. “And if this tapestry had lacked this little angel, it wouldn’t be the same tapestry. Today we are giving back to Castrojeriz something that should never have gone in the first place.” In a statement, Spain’s Policía Nacional described Van den Berghe as “an art dealer, restorer, painter, writer and international thief” who had carried out numerous robberies in the country’s churches and chapels. “He also led an organised group dedicated to stealing religious artworks – sometimes at the behest of wealthy collectors who were after a specific piece, and sometimes with an eye on an easy sale on the international black market,” the force said. Van den Berghe was arrested in 1982, but released from prison three years later after using his lawyer to help the authorities track down and recover many of the works he had stolen. The thief remained unrepentant until his death. Speaking to El País 10 years ago as he published his autobiography, Erik the Belgian – For the Love of Art, he said: “I’m no small-time crook. I’m a high-class thief. I have stolen for the love of art and I have stolen luxury items. Money has no luxury value.” Asked whether he had sought forgiveness for his sins, Van den Berghe said he had not gone to confession since he was an altar boy. “But I am a friend of Saint Peter; I’ve sold a lot of Saint Peter statues and I’ve saved a lot,” he said. “And if, when I arrive in paradise, he throws me into the flames, I’ll shoot him twice.”",Arts/Art and design,Final piece of 17th-century tapestry stolen 42 years ago found by Spanish police,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/21/final-piece-of-17th-century-tapestry-stolen-42-years-ago-found-by-spanish-police-erik-the-belgian
2/21/2022,"Plans to sign off the government’s strategy to end all remaining Covid regulations in England were delayed at the last minute amid tensions between chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the health secretary, Sajid Javid, over funds for free Covid testing. Cabinet ministers were told of the delay as they arrived at No 10 on Monday morning amid the final wrangling over the “living with Covid” strategy set to be announced to the House of Commons on in the afternoon.  A government source said there was still no agreement on the extent of the testing cutbacks between the Treasury and the Department of Health, though another source at the DHSC insisted Javid had accepted the fiscal position that most testing must end. The source denied Javid was seeking new money but wanted to be able to reprioritise his existing budgets. “DHSC are absolutely not asking for additional funding, they want to reprioritise within the existing budget,” the source said. Scientists, medics and public health experts have already expressed concerns about the plan to scrap most PCR testing and restrict free lateral flows, probably to older age groups. The national contact tracing service is expected to be wound down and schoolchildren will no longer be told to get tested twice a week. There are concerns that a lack of community testing could hamper the Panoramic trial looking at the effectiveness of antivirals, although government sources said officials were looking at options for recruiting volunteers in other ways. Johnson is likely to unveil the plan later on Monday in a Commons statement before giving a press conference, announcing an end to mandatory isolation in England and huge reductions in mass testing. Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: “The government is paralysed by its own chaos and incompetence and the British public are paying the price. This shambles cannot continue. “What confidence can the public have that the Conservatives are acting in the national interest, when they can’t agree a plan for Covid? It is clear the prime minister was trying to declare victory before the war is over, simply to distract from the police knocking at the door of No 10. “Labour published our plan for living well with Covid in January. It would prepare us for new variants and secure our lives, livelihoods and liberties. If the Conservatives are too incompetent to agree their own plan, they are welcome to use ours.” The delay came as one Tory MP expressed apprehension about the government’s plan to cut back on Covid testing in the community. Tim Loughton, a former minister, said he was pleased the government was trying to get back to as much “normality as possible”. But he told the BBC’s Westminster Hour: “I have slight apprehensions in that I think we still do need to have testing available widely because I think that is the reassurance people can have that they’ve taken all possible precautions and they don’t want to infect other people.” Paul Scully, a business minister, said it was the right thing to do as the government could not “wrap people up in cotton wool for the rest of our lives”. Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he said: “Infections are coming down quite rapidly, the hospitalisations and deaths are following as well – they tend to lag behind, obviously, the case numbers – but nonetheless you can see the trend within that.” He said Johnson would be “looking at the best advice possible but getting the balance right”. Scully also said companies would have to pay for testing and decide policies on self-isolation for staff. “We don’t test for flu, we don’t test for other diseases, and if the variants continue to be as mild as Omicron then there’s a question mark as to whether people will go through that regular testing anyway,” he told Times Radio. “But if employers want to be paying (for) tests and continuing a testing regime within their workplace, then that will be for them to pay at that point,” he said, adding that while the impact on the virus on clinically vulnerable people was a concern, “we’re not going to be having a testing regime for the next 50 years”.",News/World news,Plan to end Covid rules in England hits last-minute snag,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/plan-to-end-covid-rules-in-england-hits-last-minute-snag-sunak-javid
2/21/2022,"Sean Ingle The women’s figure skating free programme. An extraordinary evening of ice and fire, tears and peril. The heart felt for Kamila Valieva as the tears began to roll after the pressures of an extraordinary week caught up for her, but the eyes were also drawn to her teammate Alexandra Trusova and her extraordinary reaction after her five quads were only rewarded with a silver medal. “I will never go out on the ice again,” she said. ‘Never! I hate this sport! It’s impossible! You cannot do it this way! I’m not going to the awards! Everyone has a gold medal! Only I don’t! I hate it all!” When the inevitable Netflix documentary comes, Trusova will surely be the starring act.  Bryan Armen Graham The American speed skater Erin Jackson, who thought her Beijing dream was dashed after a fall at last month’s US trials appeared to cost her a place on the team, earned an Olympic gold (and a namecheck from Viola Davis) by winning the women’s 500m at the Ice Ribbon. In doing so, the converted inline skater became the first Black woman from any country to win an individual gold in a Winter Olympics event. Martin Belam I gasped out loud when Nils van der Poel broke the newly set Olympic record in the last pairing of the 5,000m men’s speed skating and snatched the gold after his great rival Patrick Roest of the Netherlands had sat watching pair after pair of skaters fail to get near his new benchmark. Van der Poel later spoke out about how “irresponsible” the IOC were to give China hosting rights. Sean Ingle The boring answer is Eileen Gu, who won two golds and a silver in the freeski. But Trusova gets silver. And the American Lindsey Jacobellis takes bronze for her two snowboard cross titles – and particularly her grab at the end of the mixed event, which banished the ghosts of 2006 for ever. Bryan Armen Graham The correct if obvious answer is Eileen Gu. The 18-year-old San Francisco-born freeskier representing her mother’s home nation of China delivered under the immense pressure of being the face of these Beijing Games by becoming the first action-sports athlete to win three medals at a single Olympics – missing out on triple gold by a fraction of a point in slopestyle – while pissing off a growing number of Americans along the way. Hard to imagine her not being one of the world’s top-earning athletes over the next decade. Martin Belam Quentin Fillon Maillet. Others may have won more golds in biathlon – Johannes Thingnes Bø I’m looking at you – but only a heartbreaking fourth place in his final men’s 15km mass start event prevented Frenchman Fillon Maillet making it an incredible six medals from six gruelling biathlon races in 14 days. He ended up with two golds and three silvers. Sean Ingle The long, long, long trips to the mountains. And not being able to see Beijing at all because of the closed loop we all found ourselves in, unable to leave our guarded hotel except to go to a venue or media centre. Bryan Armen Graham It was difficult to imagine the reputation of an event literally known as the Genocide Games sinking any lower, but Kamila Valieva’s presence in the Winter Olympics’ glamour event after a positive drugs test managed to pull it off. By the end, a worldwide audience of millions watched the favourite melt down spectacularly then get chewed out by her coach before she was even off the ice, the silver medallist Alexandra Trusova uncontrollably sob rage-tears and appear to retire on the spot while the gold medallist sat by herself catatonic in the green room holding a teddy bear and ignored by everyone, all of it green-lit in order to – checks notes – prevent irreparable harm. Might even unseat the Nancy-Tonya debacle for on-the-night messiness. Martin Belam Men’s and women’s ice hockey organised to feature 38 pool matches that resulted in the grand total of just two women’s teams out of 22 nations not reaching the next stage. A lengthy pointless exercise, although at least Finland gave us a surprise victory in the men’s competition in the end. Sean Ingle Early in the Games two English journalists referred to Kamila Valieva as being regarded as ‘Miss Perfect’ in Russia – both mistakenly thinking they had read it somewhere. They were wrong, but it was too late. Days later the term was being used everywhere. Bryan Armen Graham Jamaica’s first alpine skier, Benjamin Alexander, looking directly into the camera after finishing his second run of the men’s giant slalom more than a minute behind the podium spots: “I’m exhausted. I need a massage and a beer.” Same bro, same. Martin Belam When a Games widely criticised for the environmental damage of relying on artificial snow had to cancel and reschedule events because it suddenly had too much of the real thing. Sean Ingle British skater Cornelius Kersten deserved more credit than he got for finishing ninth in the 1,000m. Also, the thousands of Chinese volunteers who were all incredible, endlessly patient – and will now have to undergo three weeks of quarantine before getting home. They all deserve medals. Bryan Armen Graham Biathlon doesn’t always get the shine it deserves so let us now praise Norway’s Bø brothers. The combined Beijing haul of Johannes Thingnes (four gold, one bronze) and Tarjei (two gold, one silver, one bronze) would have landed them in the top 10 of the medal table if they were their own country. Martin Belam Elsa Desmond may have finished last in the women’s luge but she essentially set up the Irish Luge Federation herself to get to these Games, and goes home from Beijing back to working in an NHS hospital as a GP in Essex. Sean Ingle … fun, although the gaps between venues mean a lot of travel. Bryan Armen Graham … the most sprawling Olympics ever featuring venues spread out over 22,000 sq km (about 10,000 sq miles) across northern Italy. The use of preexisting infrastructure is a plus for sustainability, but the alpine skier Federica Brignone was among a number of prominent Italian athletes who say it will diminish any sense of Olympic spirit. “Everyone will be in their own area,” the three-time Olympic medallist said this week. “From an ecological standpoint it will be much better. But in terms of Olympic atmosphere, I’m not sure how it will be but I don’t think it will be very nice.” Martin Belam … hopefully a chance to enjoy a Winter Olympics free of geopolitical showboating and doping scandals, but I’m not going to hold my breath.",Sport/Sport,"Winter Olympics: highs, lows, heroes and villains of Beijing 2022",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/winter-olympics-highs-lows-heroes-villains-beijing-2022
2/21/2022,"This scrappy, rough-around-the-edges documentary from Norway is directed by two friends and began after one of them, Petter Aaberg, attempted to kill himself. It’s a fly-on-the-wall study of Aaberg and four other young Norwegians struggling with their mental health. It is raw and intense, and also troubling in places: Aaberg and Kvamme keep the camera rolling on these vulnerable people in moments of crisis, testing the limits of documentary ethics. One of their subjects is Monica, whose arms are horrifically scarred by self-harm. A sexual abuse survivor, she lives in a constant state of hyper-vigilance. We see her having a panic attack in the street after hearing a car backfire. Monica introduces the directors to Emma, her trans friend who is struggling with the agonisingly long wait for surgery. Another subject is heroin addict Cornelia, who is filmed injecting herself and being rushed to hospital, her umpteenth overdose. I wasn’t convinced that showing moments such as this, honest and hard-hittingly intimate as they are, take us any closer to understanding Monica, Emma or Cordelia.  In fact, the person we watch most is co-director Aaberg: his story monopolises the film in a way that some viewers may find narcissistic. But his openness and vulnerability, his willingness to say exactly whatever he is feeling in the moment, is disarming. He starts a relationship with another woman, Miriam, and there’s a scene of two of them having sex which is filmed with huge sensitivity; it’s genuinely not exploitative. As the film progresses, it’s clear the relationship between the directors and their subjects has developed into friendship. Aaberg and Kvamme talk in an interview about the agreement they had with their subjects, who could pull out at any point and had approval on the final cut of the film. Is it enough? Do they cross the line? I wasn’t sure.  Young & Afraid is available on 25 February on True Story.

2/21/2022,"A significant number of children remain in situations of “unknown and unassessed” risk, according to a report on children’s services in Solihull, triggered by the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. The joint targeted area inspection of child protection services in Solihull found that in a “significant minority” of cases decisions in safeguarding were “over-optimistic” and lacked “professional curiosity”.  The inspection report, published on Monday, found that parents’ details were entered incorrectly into police databases, leaving children at risk of potential harm. Inspectors said they were concerned by incomplete police records which had left children potentially “at risk of significant harm”. They saw examples of separate records for the same person because their name had been spelled incorrectly, while children had not been linked on the system to family relatives who could pose a risk to them. In December Emma Tustin, 32, was sentenced for at least 29 years for the murder of her six-year-old stepson Arthur, who was physically assaulted, poisoned with salt and forced to stand in isolation for up to 14 hours a day at her home in Solihull in the months leading up to his death. The boy’s father, 29-year-old Thomas Hughes, was given 21 years in prison for manslaughter. Social workers visited Tustin’s house two months before Arthur’s death after concerns were raised by his grandmother, Joanne Hughes, about bruises on his back, but they concluded there were “no safeguarding concerns”. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, launched the review to identify lessons to be learned from Arthur’s case. The report also found local children’s safeguarding services in Solihull have undergone frequent changes in personnel for a significantly long period of time and have become understaffed. The murder of Arthur has made “social workers highly reluctant to work in Solihull either on a permanent or agency basis”, it stated.",News/Society,Arthur Labinjo-Hughes report: significant number of children still at risk in Solihull,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/arthur-labinjo-hughes-report-significant-number-of-children-still-at-risk-in-solihull
2/21/2022,"Germany will offer its population a new protein-based Covid-19 vaccine comparable to conventional flu jabs this week, in the hope of swaying a sizeable minority that remains sceptical of the novel mRNA technology used in the most commonly used vaccines. About 1.4m doses of the Nuvaxovid vaccine developed by the US biotech company Novavax are to arrive in Germany this week, the country’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, confirmed last Friday. A further million doses are to arrive the week after, with the German government’s total order for the year 2022 amounting to 34m doses.  Novavax’s product has until now been used only in Indonesia and the Philippines, but it was permitted for use in the EU last December. It is still awaiting authorisation in the US, as some concerns about the company’s production capacity persist. Unlike the novel mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna or viral vector made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, Nuvaxovid is a protein subunit vaccine. It contains a non-infectious component on the surface of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which induces a protective immune response when the body’s immune cells come into contact with it. Novavax announced in June last year that its vaccine had proven more than 90% effective against symptomatic infections with the Alpha variant, in trials including nearly 30,000 volunteers in the US and Mexico. The company says its product is similarly effective against the Delta and Omicron variants, especially after a booster shot administered six months after the second jab. Germany’s Paul Ehrlich Institute notes that the data proving the vaccine’s efficacy against more infectious variants remains limited. Surveys in Germany suggest a considerable interest in the Novavax jab among the 19.8 million people in the country who have so far declined to take a jab against Covid-19. Out of 4,000 unvaccinated hospital workers surveyed in Berlin, 1,800 expressed an interest in the protein-based vaccine. In the northern state of Lower Saxony, the health ministry said 6,000 people had put their name on a waiting list for Nuvaxovid by early February. Some scientists question whether the new vaccine will prove a gamechanger in a country whose overall vaccination rate has been flatlining at about 75% for months. Lars Korn, a co-author of a current survey of anti-vaccine attitudes conducted by the University of Erfurt, told the public broadcaster ZDF that two-thirds of respondents would continue to completely reject any form of vaccination.",News/World news,Germany hopes protein-based Covid vaccine will sway sceptics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/germany-hopes-nuvaxovid-protein-based-covid-vaccine-will-sway-sceptics
2/21/2022,"When Lucy Hannah decided to put together an anthology of short stories by Afghan women in 2019, it already seemed like a hugely ambitious project. Most of the authors involved had never had the opportunity to work with an editor before. One contributor submitted her story by taking photos of handwritten pages and sending them via WhatsApp. Another had previously published her work online, but not in print. “I have never come across a local publisher willing to publish a book without asking for money from the author,” she said. “And it’s impossible to find a foreign publisher who wants to read books about anything except the war.”  Then Covid-19 hit in 2020, followed by the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. “It was hard work,” admits Hannah, a former BBC employee who helped to set up the BBC Writersroom. The anthology, My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird, was published this week by MacLehose Press, but many of the team involved have never met. With the 18 writers based in Afghanistan (10 have since managed to leave), an editor in Sri Lanka and translators in the UK, all communication had to be done remotely. The fact that the book has now been published is the result of a team effort that “relied on everybody trusting each other”, says Hannah. The project was run by the organisation Hannah set up to help amplify the work of marginalised writers, Untold Narratives. When working with scriptwriters in Afghanistan four years ago, Hannah spoke with some female writers who were able to get hired to work on a radio soap opera, but were finding it hard to get their prose fiction published. Wanting to help, Hannah came back to the UK to raise funds and the Write Afghanistan project was born. After two open calls for submissions across Afghanistan, with the second call focused on isolated parts of the country, Untold Narratives read approximately 300 submissions before selecting the 18 writers who would contribute to My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird. Several of the stories draw on the writers’ experience of living in the midst of violence. Zainab Akhlaqi’s Blossom, for example, draws on the real-life bombing of the Sayed ul-Shuhada high school in Kabul. The story ends on a note of defiant hope: its young narrator, Nekbakht, decides she wants to “show some spirit in the face of our struggles”, and goes back to school. Akhlaqi found a similar sense of hope knowing that her work was going to reach a global audience. “In the worst days of my country’s history, [working with Untold] gave me the hope and spirit to write,” she says. “These writers don’t have the support that those in the UK do when they’re starting out,” says Hannah. “So this is about encouraging the global gatekeepers to welcome in voices, in translation, who don’t necessarily have a local creative infrastructure to support them.” Marie Bamyani, whose story The Black Crow of Winter is about a mother struggling to provide for her family, is passionate that the voices of Afghan women get heard. “My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird is the starting point of bringing Afghan writers together and sharing their voices and stories with the world,” she says. “The world must not let this light be turned off.”  My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird is published by MacLehose Press (£12).

2/21/2022,"There was a deluge in Leeds on Sunday. From the stands of Elland Road any number of objects rained down: coins, bottles, lighters, fireworks, in one instance even a golf ball. They came down at moments of maximum excitement and disappointment, of tension and frustration. Frequently they were aimed at the players of Manchester United. The 19-year-old forward Anthony Elanga was hit by what appeared to be a coin after celebrating Manchester United’s third goal in the 70th minute. He dropped to his haunches, before being cajoled back into play by his teammates. He went on to score the decisive goal in the match and ran straight over to the corner of the ground where he had been assaulted to celebrate.  Above: Manchester United’s Anthony Elanga is pictured on his knees after being struck by a missile. Right: A steward retrieves a golf ball from the pitch earlier in the match. Below: Elanga scoring the winner and celebrating at the end of the game. All photos by Tom Jenkins. This was the odd thing about the resumption of the Roses derby. It was another prominent fixture that featured precisely the kind of behaviour no one would condone and yet pretty much everyone at the ground lent into its tribal atmosphere. It exemplified all the problems English football is experiencing regarding disorder, but anyone at Elland Road on Sunday would find it hard to deny the occasion was anything other than exhilarating. Perhaps the feeling would have been different had not another deluge intervened, the rain hammering down all day in Leeds. There were no groups drinking outside the city centre bars, although police did report “a few incidents” in the city centre before the game. There were no Manchester United fans walking down to the ground by the side of the A643 (to be fair there was one, Jordan, doing the SIIUUU in puddles to annoy his friends and relatives who, like him, were from Leeds). Even at the stadium the rain acted as its own security cordon to dispel any fractiousness. One hour before kick-off, on one side of Elland Road there was Billy’s bar and a crowd in the stairwell; on the other The Old Peacock and an even bigger gathering in the Covid-secure terracing. Both crowds were loud, crude and hostile to even the idea of Manchester United support. They seemed to be waiting for the away fans to arrive. But they were also not about to get soaked. There was one man, a thickset middle-aged fellow called Steve who was standing in the Peacock car park in a woollen jumper and jeans, conducting the crowd in a sing-along. Leeds fans arrive before the Premier League match at Elland Road against old rivals Manchester United. “It’s been 16 years in the making, we’ve got to show up for it,” said Steve of the event and his determination to mark it (the 16 years refers to Leeds’ absence from the top flight). Like other Leeds fans, when asked about the nature of the rivalry, Steve couldn’t put a finger on a moment in time, but acknowledged Manchester United’s history for taking Leeds players, from Gordon McQueen to Rio Ferdinand and Eric Cantona in between. There was a more general dissatisfaction too. “It’s the arrogance,” he said. “They just take who they like, drop £30m and that’s it.” Reg is 54 and was standing on the edge of the car park with his family eating a burger in the rain. He drew attention to the unique circumstances in which the game was taking place. “It’s louder than I’ve ever known it, and I remember the 70s and the 80s,” he said of the Elland Road atmosphere. “It’s that year we missed out, there’s so much energy.” Not only had Leeds dropped out of the Premier League in 2004, they returned in 2020 when Covid forced matches behind closed doors. This season is about making up for time lost on two fronts. While the home crowds waited under awnings and sang horrible things about Manchester United’s players and support, the away fans were being smuggled into the stadium by the back door. They too were in assertive spirits, with this correspondent mistaken for a Leeds fan by one bus-load and given the finger by dozens of young men for more than a minute. But the two groups of fans never came into contact, just as the police had planned it. Mounted police outside Elland Road before Sunday’s match. This was the second crucial factor that meant Sunday’s match bubbled up without ever quite boiling over into fighting: an enormous police presence. It wasn’t always visible, as different units were moved around the city “like chess pieces”, as one officer put it. It was largely friendly, with the kind of cheery, jocular interventions that are seen as the model for building trust and relationships with fans. On Monday West Yorkshire police confirmed they had made a total of nine arrests for “offences including public order, throwing of missiles and breach of banning order”. Rumours around the ground speculated at 900 officers on duty. It seemed likely an exaggeration but it did appear that police had been brought in from elsewhere in the country. Any questions on the extent of resources deployed were batted away, however, with the force telling the Guardian: “We don’t disclose the number of officers involved in large public order operations for operational reasons.” There was no doubt though that dozens of officers played a central role in segregating fans in the ground during the raucous duration of the match and dozens more formed cordons in the surrounding streets to make sure rival supporters were kept apart afterwards. All the while, up among the murky clouds, a helicopter guided proceedings. The players clash after Elanga was fouled by Junior Firpo. Harry Maguire celebrates in front of the Leeds fans after scoring the opening goal, before a smoke bomb is let off by Manchester United supporters. Leeds fans celebrate as their side come from two goals down. The day ended with the away support driven back into town in a phalanx of rail replacement buses, afforded the sort of siren-wailing security detail usually the preserve of world leaders. They were buzzed back up the road where a cordon of police blocked off the back entrance to the station and fans were smuggled inside like so many boyband members going back to their hotel. At the front of the station a stream of wailing wagons deposited officers who then proceeded to the platforms, shepherding passengers on board the Transpennine express. “The majority of fans on both sides behaved appropriately throughout the match and there was no significant disorder,” police said. But that wasn’t the final action of the day. As those same police left the station and went back into their vans, an officer was asked if that was it for the day. “Oh no,” he said. Where next then? “Anywhere, wherever they tell us.” A Leeds fan flanked by police after the defeat.",Sport/Football,Sneer and loathing: a day with Leeds and Manchester United fans,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/21/a-day-with-leeds-and-manchester-united-fans-police
2/21/2022,"Thousands of asylum seekers fear they could lose their Home Office hotel accommodation because some owners want to offer rooms to tourists and other travellers. One letter sent to a group of asylum seekers being accommodated by the Home Office in a hotel close to central London states: “Dear guests, we would like to kindly inform you that your accommodation with us is going to end on 31 January (2022). We advise you to get in touch with your local council for alternative accommodation.”  The accommodation is managed for the Home Office by Clearsprings. Their subcontractors intervened after the eviction letter was circulated to the asylum seekers and sent a second letter stating: “Under the law (hotel owners) cannot ask you to leave the premises forcefully. Please note that if for any reason your entry card is cancelled and you cannot gain access to your apartment please call the police immediately as this will be classed as an illegal eviction.” The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants is supporting asylum seekers in this accommodation who received the letter. They say they are vulnerable and include a mother with a newborn baby and a survivor of domestic violence. Minnie Rahman, the campaigns director for JCWI, said: “Nobody should have to fear they’ll be kicked out on to the streets on a cold winter’s night.” She said the number of eviction threats were increasing. “Our lawyers have been on the phone to young mums and families who’ve been terrified they were going to end up homeless, and unfortunately we know these kinds of threats are widespread. The Home Office needs to be granting people who’ve sought safety here decent, stable accommodation so they can rebuild their lives.” JCWI started a legal action against the Home Office following the threat to evict from the hotel close to central London. In its response, the Home Office confirmed that the asylum seekers were entitled to accommodation but that no suitable alternative to the hotel had yet been found. The charity Asylum Matters said it had received information that some hotel owners wanted to reopen their hotels for paying guests for this year’s summer season, now that Covid travel restrictions are being lifted, but that issues of lack of communication between hotels and asylum seekers were “rife”. The charity produced a report in December 2021 – In a Place Like a Prison – documenting asylum seekers’ bad experiences in hotels and other accommodation such as army barracks. It warned that the accommodation centres the Home Office planned to use in future to at least partially replace hotels would be akin to “large prison-like refugee camps in the UK”. The Home Office is facing record backlogs in processing asylum claims with more than 80,000 awaiting the outcome. This means that movement out of traditional asylum seeker accommodation in shared houses and flats is slower. Meanwhile, Visit Britain is predicting a significant boost in tourist visits this year. London hotels have reported a surge in tourist bookings as Covid travel restrictions ease and levels of the virus drop. The Home Office said recently that it had been spending £4.7m a day on hotel accommodation for 12,000 Afghans being resettled in the UK and 25,000 asylum seekers. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The letters were sent to a small number of people in one accommodation site in error and without approval from the Home Office. We are liaising with Clearsprings to make sure this does not happen again. “The use of hotels is only ever a short-term solution and we are working with local authorities to find appropriate long term accommodation across the United Kingdom.” Clearsprings has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,Asylum seekers fear loss of UK hotel rooms as owners look to tourism season,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/asylum-seekers-fear-loss-of-uk-hotel-rooms-as-owners-look-to-tourism-season
