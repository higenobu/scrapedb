2/25/2022,"Sharks are notorious for chomping on hooked fish before anglers can reel them in, but one Australian fisherman learned the hard way that sharks will also eat other sharks, too. Jason Moyce — known as “Trapman Bermagui” on social media — had not one, but three sharks bitten in half as he pulled them in this week, including two hammerheads. It happened Tuesday, Feb. 22, off the coast of New South Wales in southern Australia, and Moyce posted photos of the three sharks with a series of complaints about his worsening luck. “Plenty of smooth hammerhead sharks around. But getting a whole one to the boat is a challenge,” the Trapman Bermagui Facebook page reported after it happened the second time. Then a dusky shark — also called a “bronzie” — was pulled in, missing everything beyond its front fins. Clearly, much bigger predators were nearby, he concluded. “Even the bronzies aren’t safe today,” he wrote. “No more shark fishing for us. Too many big units around.” Hungry sharks are known for “tail fishing boats” off Australia in search of easy meals, Moyce told 9news.com.au. However, in this case, it appeared the boat had attracted some rather large sharks. “There were just too many big ones,” Moyce told the station. “They were down deep, I couldn’t see them but I think they were tiger sharks.” Tiger sharks can reach nearly 11 feet off Australia, according to New South Whales government data. Moyce, “a second generation pro fisherman,” said he wasn’t the only one having troubles that day. Anglers on a recreational boat caught a mako shark and “found a smaller mako, bitten in two in its stomach,” according to a post on the Trapman Bermagui Facebook page. It included a photo of both sharks. Waters off Australia are home to about 170 species of shark, with the biggest concentration (50 species) living in the Coral Sea, according to Australiangeographic.com. Among them is the great white shark, a species linked to the Feb. 16 killing of diving instructor Simon Nellist as he swam near a Sydney Beach, the BBC reports.

2/25/2022,"By David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday accused China and Russia of working together to create a new 'profoundly illiberal' world order of which Moscow's actions towards Ukraine were just a part. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said every responsible country in the world, including China, had an obligation to urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down and de-escalate the Ukraine crisis. ""You will have to ask the PRC whether they have used their own considerable influence with the Russian Federation to that end,"" Price said at a regular news briefing in reference to the People's Republic of China. Referring to an upgraded ""no limits"" partnership that China and Russia announced this month in which they pledged to collaborate more against the United States and the West, Price said the direction of the development of China-Russia relations was of ""great concern."" ""We think that Russia and the PRC also want a world order,"" he said. ""But this is an order that is and would be profoundly illiberal, an order that stands in contrast to the system that countries around the world ... have built in the last seven decades. ""It is an order that is in many ways destructive, rather than additive."" Price noted that China had repeatedly in its statecraft stressed that the principal of sovereignty was inviolable and sacrosanct. ""So, you'll have to ask the PRC, how they marry that long-standing position with anything less than an effort to use the considerable influence and sway they have with the Russian Federation to urge Vladimir Putin to back down and to de-escalate,"" he said. Ukraine declared a state of emergency on Wednesday and Moscow said separatists in the east had asked for help to repel ""aggression"" as the United States stepped up efforts to deter an all-out Russian invasion by imposing fresh sanctions. China has urged all parties in the Ukraine standoff to exercise restraint and said that the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country should be respected and safeguarded. At the same time, it has urged the United States to respect and address Russia's demands for security guarantees. U.S.-based analysts say China is concerned about the impact Russian actions towards Ukraine could have on its trade relationship with Europe if it is considered to be supporting Russia. But they also believe Beijing's ambiguous stance and its upgraded pact with Russia have given Putin the confidence to press ahead on Ukraine. Experts told Reuters last week China would back Russia diplomatically and perhaps economically if it invades Ukraine, but would stop short of providing military support. Washington has warned Chinese firms they would face consequences if they sought to evade any export controls imposed on Moscow in the event of Russia invading Ukraine.
