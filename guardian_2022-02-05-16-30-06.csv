2/5/2022,"The government’s new levelling-up strategy should help Britain’s left-behind towns and cities emulate Renaissance Florence in cooking up the “secret sauce” of economic success, according to its co-author Andy Haldane. The hefty report, published on Wednesday, was mocked by some for its frequent historical references – including to 15th-century Florence under the Medici – but Haldane, a former Bank of England chief economist, is deadly serious.  Only by looking back at where and when economic development has really worked, he says, can we decide how to reverse what he calls 70 years of government failure in tackling regional inequality. “The power of this is not that every part of the UK is going to look like Florence – I think that would be a stretch,” he said. But he added that the “raw ingredients” were the right ones. “It was the coming together of scientists and artists and business people, and financiers of course, as the Medicis themselves were. It was that crucible, of skills and of professions and of sectors, public, private, third, that generates a kind of spontaneous combustion.” As the permanent secretary to the Cabinet Office and former chair of the industrial strategy council, Haldane was a key driving force behind the 350-page document. It set out for the first time what Boris Johnson’s election pledge to “level up” the UK means in terms of policies and targets. Twelve wide-ranging new “missions” on narrowing regional gaps in everything from healthy life expectancy to crime rates will be put into legislation, giving the government a duty to pursue them. And a new wave of devolution will see every area in England given the option of a London-style metro mayor. Haldane said the agenda had been made all the more pressing by the cost-of-living crisis, which is hitting hardest in many of the areas the report is focused on helping. “Let’s not mince our words: the numbers are big and they are real,” he said. But he added that it “reinforces the importance” of taking action. While experts have praised its ambition, some have questioned whether the white paper’s many targets are too scattergun: the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, warned: “There is something for everyone, and hence little sense of prioritisation: ambition and resource will be spread very thin.” But Haldane insisted that economic regeneration only works when a range of different factors are tackled. “We know the secret sauce of success in places has these multiple ingredients. You can’t just not do transport, or not do high streets or not do jobs or not do broadband,” he said. “You’ll fail if you have one missing ingredient, in the same way as if you miss out the eggs or the sugar or the flour from the cake, it’ll fall flat.” Another major question mark over the report was whether the Treasury had set aside enough resources to match its ambition – and whether Rishi Sunak was really committed to the agenda. Haldane acknowledged that the current three-year spending review, which he admitted was “sealed”, would have to be just the start. “It’s a 2030 mission. So the government – whichever government – will have several bites at this cherry. Several spending reviews to get through.” He also argued that spending on many areas of public services, from health to transport to crime, could serve the purpose of helping to level up the UK, as long as they were distributed towards the areas of greatest need. “We’re talking about general wellbeing and pride in place; that doesn’t translate into a single budgetary pot.” All departments will now have to report the spatial allocation of their spending across the country, in the hope that this will help to drive change. “Shocker: some departments couldn’t even tell you where it’s going geographically.” Haldane also pointed to improvements that can be made without funding from taxpayers, through regulation, for example. The white paper included an announcement that the government’s Decent Homes Standard, setting minimum levels properties must reach, would now be applied to private rentals. “I was in Blackpool a few years ago now. And I remember touring around some of the private rental sector houses – they were absolutely horrific,” he says. Official figures show that 21% of private rental properties fail to meet the required standard. “It’s completely intolerable,” Haldane said. He added that “private landlords will have to pay” for the necessary improvements: “I would say that’s the right outcome”. With the launch coming in the middle of another chaotic week for Johnson’s teetering government, senior officials like Haldane could be excused for wondering if their big ideas would last more than a few weeks. But he insists the levelling-up agenda is here to stay – “the opposite of a bad budget” that unravels within days. “Looking back at UK history and international history, unless you commit to the long-term course, you’ve got absolutely no chance,” he said.",News/Business,‘Secret sauce of success’: levelling-up report co-author on why UK should be like Renaissance Florence,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/levelling-up-report-author-uk-like-renaissance-florence
2/5/2022,"In the decade following her bestselling 2003 debut, Brick Lane, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize then turned into a film, Monica Ali produced three more novels. First came Alentejo Blue, loosely linked vignettes set in a Portuguese village that bore almost no relation in style, conviction or tone to Brick Lane. In the Kitchen followed, a meandering tale of a London chef in crisis, and then Untold Story, an odd novel in which Princess Diana fakes her death and moves to small-town America. Critical responses to all three were mixed (the New York Times called Untold Story “preposterously gimmicky”). There was a 10-year gap. And now Ali is back with Love Marriage, a novel about the rocky engagement of Yasmin Ghorami, a 26-year-old trainee doctor whose parents are originally from Kolkata, and fellow medic Joe Sangster, the upper middle-class son of an outspoken feminist author.  As the book opens, Yasmin is nervously anticipating an introductory family dinner at her future mother-in-law’s huge Primrose Hill home. Although Harriet always uses caterers, Yasmin’s mother, Anisah, an eccentrically dressed homemaker with “a talent for being herself”, has spent 10 hours cooking (“shukto, alu dom, dal pakori, kachori …”). Yasmin knows her parents will insist on driving from south London unfashionably early, clutching carrier bags stuffed with Tupperware. The elegant Harriet, who spends her life writing essays on liberal guilt while throwing lavish parties for the literati, will graciously “hide her amusement”. Harriet is, in fact, thrilled at the prospect of her new culturally diverse family ties. It’s debatable whether the Ghoramis feel quite as enthusiastic. Harriet is famous for a photograph taken in the 1990s in which she posed naked, glaring defiantly at the camera. Yasmin’s younger brother Arif, an unemployed sociology graduate, is delighted to have found this image online. He has also spotted their mother reading one of Harriet’s books over the kitchen bin, before hurling it in. The stage, then, is set for comedic culture clashes, generational tensions, embarrassment, misunderstanding, conflict and, we trust, resolution. Publishers fought to buy Love Marriage and the BBC is turning it into a drama. It isn’t hard to see why. It is an exploration of multicultural British modernity, of love, sex, class, politics, faith and family. But how well does it work in literary terms? Yasmin, who plans to specialise in geriatric medicine, is mild and kind, an appeaser who has spent her life trying to meet the expectations of her father Shaokat, a south London GP who rose from orphaned poverty. “Baba” loves to spend his evenings puzzling over obscure medical cases with his daughter, who increasingly wonders if she ever really wanted to be a doctor at all. At the agonising introductory dinner both mothers, for very different reasons, hijack the wedding preparations; but then an unlikely companionship springs up between them. Fuelled by Harriet and her artsy friends, Anisah begins a feminist reawakening, abruptly – and this is a bit of a credibility stretch – moving into Harriet’s house. Yasmin’s growing bewilderment at her mother’s behaviour is tempered by a personal crisis: her perfect fiance Joe admits to a one-night stand. Yasmin responds with her own sexual rebellion, and soon nobody is behaving as they should: there is a lesbian affair, a shock pregnancy, two fist fights, a blood-stained bedroom, several racist incidents, and some deep family reckonings, including a particularly distressing revelation about how Yasmin’s parents really met. There are riches here. All the components of modern identity are laid out: race, class, gender, faith, sexuality. Ali explores generational and cultural tensions, as well as contemporary political issues such as Islamophobia, NHS underfunding and Brexit. There is a big cast and the chapters jump between several perspectives (we even, puzzlingly, get Joe’s psychotherapist), but perhaps because we enter so many heads, often fleetingly, complexities begin to flatten. Joe, for instance, never quite emerges from the psychological diagnosis that defines him. It is therefore hard to invest too deeply in the engagement, or in Yasmin’s feelings about it. Peripheral characters sometimes seem to exist to make a point. A performance artist called Flame, one of Harriet’s friends, is no more than a plot device to fuel Anisah’s journey, and Yasmin’s best friend Rania, a would-be “Muslimah Kim Kardashian” who despairs about faith-based dating sites, tends to pop up as a sounding board, or to demonstrate a big cultural point. A scene in which Rania suddenly decides to drink alcohol initially feels odd. Later, when video footage of her drunkenness sparks a social media furore about feminism and faith, it is hard to ignore the authorial puppeteer tweaking at the strings. One notable exception is Baba. Tormented by hang-ups, he is a fully realised and often moving character. He loves his children deeply but is so desperate for them to succeed, to prove to the world that he is worthy, solid and safe, that he risks alienating them entirely. He is also furious with his wife. The story goes that the two met in a library, a “love match”. Anisah’s well-to-do family grudgingly accepted him because he was bright – they even paid his medical school fees (he paid them back, he boasts, with interest). This journey from poverty explains why he is so harsh on his son. Arif feels hopeless, angry, unwanted and unconfident, but Baba sees only a lack of motivation. The tension between the two festers until, one day, it explodes. This is the kind of complex emotional authenticity that made Brick Lane such a hit. This novel is largely engaging, entertaining and relevant and there will be lots of love for it, possibly prizes. Ali is a good storyteller, sometimes enlightening, but there is the feeling of a smaller, tighter, more devastating novel lurking here. As it is, the emotional punches can get a little lost amid the padding and point-making.  Love Marriage is published by Virago (£18.99).

2/5/2022,"One thing the last two years and counting of the pandemic has given us (which no one gives it credit for) is: a renewed love of parlour games. Everyone is down on the coronavirus, but we do have to give it that particular due. “Oh, but we couldn’t go to the supermarket … ” Yeah, but you got Zoom quizzes. “Oh, but we couldn’t see our loved ones for months on end … ” Hmm, OK, but Quiplash and Among Us filled a void. “Oh, but I lost my job and couldn’t get a haircut … ” Fine. But you had six months to sit on the floor doing jigsaws and getting too into adult board games? What is the problem, exactly? Honestly, I think some people just like moaning. Anyway, this is a TV column, and it should behave accordingly. The second series of Mel Giedroyc: Unforgivable drops on Dave this week (10pm, Tuesday), and it feels, somehow, related. The format is thus: Mel Giedroyc sits on a throne and coaxes a revolving cast of British comedians into performing tasks and games. She has an underling who sits on a lower chair than her and they do various pre-planned skits that never quite hit, but that is sort of the charm. Katherine Ryan is in an episode, Jamali Maddix in another. Hold on. Hmm. No, it’s not Taskmaster, you’re right. But it is, isn’t it?  It feels a bit dismissive to say Unforgivable is “Taskmaster, but Dave still has the license for it”, but to ignore the role Taskmaster plays in the genesis of all this seems like ignoring a very large, Greg Davies-shaped elephant in the room. Taskmaster (I am not explaining what Taskmaster is. You are reading the Guardian. You know what Taskmaster is) was the breakout hit from Dave’s get-away-from-Top-Gear-repeats-by-elevating-British-comedy tactic. It defected to Channel 4, but there are a lot of interesting shows with interesting comedians leftover: the James Acaster and Josh Widdicombe-fronted Hypothetical, the deeply enjoyable British as Folk, the rebrand of Late Night Mash. Unforgivable is along the same lines – British comedians you haven’t heard of getting their first big run at TV, a few comedy stalwarts in the mix, some pre-planned storytelling that rapidly goes off-piste – that makes all of them so good. We’ve had a fallow few years with panel shows. The Cats are always doing Countdown, of course, and Would I Lie To You? and Mock the Week are still mainstays on the BBC, but it hasn’t felt like the giddy panel-heavy days of the late 90s and early 00s for a while. Why? You would have thought the easiest path to TV gold would be “put five to six funny people in a room together and let them be unscriptedly rude”, but sometimes it just doesn’t work. Is it the cultural temperature at the time? Too many celebrities in the mix and not enough comedians? Is it the exact right format? – but it feels like Dave is closest to cracking the alchemy right now. Unforgivable can clank a little; every episode starts agonisingly slowly. Giedroyc brightly asking everyone, “Tell us an embarrassing story!” can veer into office away-day ice-breaker awkwardness, and I could do with fewer rhyming puns – but it understands the best way to make funny people be funny on TV is, simply, by letting them. Giedroyc helps – her post-Bake Off pivot to “wholesomely cheeky schoolmarm” has been a delight to watch – as does Lou Sanders who, in the role of underling, consistently comes out with the sort of lines you can’t believe survived an edit (the new series starts with a throwaway joke featuring a toilet roll prop that made me have to pause the screener to compose myself). Their nice/naughty dynamic helps pull structure out of what is, for the first third of each episode at least, people sat in chairs storytelling. But the episodes get more manic as they progress: essentially, someone always gets comfortable enough to tell the country the last place and time they shat themselves, and once that Rubicon has been crossed (normally around the 24-minute mark), there are a lot more laughs. It’s not quite the can’t-miss format of the show that came before it, but it’s a valiant attempt. Listen up, the rest of British TV! Put more funny people on shows where they can be funny! Dave has figured it out! Catch up!",Arts/Television & radio,Missing Taskmaster?

2/5/2022,"Lucy is the team’s captain, so she looks after the ball. Her family’s house is about 10 minutes’ walk from the pitch: it is one of the more established dwellings in Minawao, a permanent structure largely screened behind a high mud wall. She greets her mother, who is sitting outside with an aunt, in Hausa before disappearing inside. Once she has retrieved what she came for, the day’s training can begin. “We play football with our friends to ease our minds,” she says. “That’s why they give girls this ball to play with: to forget about what happened to us.” This could barely seem further from Yaounde, where the Africa Cup of Nations final will take place on Sunday. We are 500 miles away in Cameroon’s extreme north region, tropical greenery having given way to the parched fringes of the Sahel.  For almost a decade it has been one of the most troubled areas on earth, haunted by unspeakable atrocities. Minawao is a refugee camp that opened in 2013 to provide safety for thousands of Nigerians who have fled, and continue to flee, from the Islamist terror group Boko Haram. The border is only 20 miles away but life is relatively calm here. For those who made it this far, the process of rebuilding can begin. Access to Minawao is heavily restricted but, with assistance from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the Guardian spent a day in the camp with its girls’ football team. Twenty players, aged between 15 and 19, train five times a week on a dry, flat area of ground in front of the settlement’s youth centre. The team was formed to ensure girls could play despite a male-dominated environment and its sessions are overseen by Modu, a stern but affectionate 35-year-old who coached a school side in his village before the terrorists forced him to join Minawao’s first influx of arrivals. He leads warm-ups and then, when everybody has loosened, begins a series of passing drills. “If a girl wants to play, she only has to come to me and she’ll be training with us the next day,” he says. Football has become part of life’s fabric for these players. It is a source of pride and certainty when, here of all places, there is little of the latter. Occasionally Modu can take the team to play friendlies outside the camp; recently they travelled 15 miles to Mokolo to face opponents from other nearby communities. “We win most of the time,” Lucy says matter-of-factly. “We won a cup and shared the prizes,” adds her vice-captain, Fayiza. “I will never forget that day in my life.” Each of Minawao’s 69,000 inhabitants has lived their own version of a horrifying shared history. Lucy was only nine when her village in Borno state, Kunde, was raided by Boko Haram. “They arrived and started killing people,” she says. “We hid in a cave at night and it was impossible to sleep. They were holding guns and we were so afraid of them. I lost my uncle and many other people died. We had to run.” Fayiza, too, experienced things nobody should have to endure. “We saw people in our village running and some were falling down, the attackers were shooting them,” she says. “We ran away and, after they had finished fighting, we went back. After about a month they returned, killing men but not women. The women were saying: ‘How can we live a life without men, who go to their jobs and provide for the family?’ We left again and they followed, and it went on for about a year like this. Then the people from UNHCR met us, took our names and drove us to Minawao.” The camp’s population continues to swell. Boko Haram remain active in Nigeria and there have been attacks in the far north of Cameroon in the past year. Refugees are repatriated when it is deemed safe to do so but some people choose to return, finding Minawao’s security and familiarity preferable to the desolated areas they left behind. Resources are under heavy strain in an area where rivers have run dry and vegetation is feeling the effects of pressure on the terrain. “We have a problem with livelihood,” says Luka Isaac, who is the refugees’ president and leads their discussions with organisations who are active in the camp. “Only about 25% of people here are economically active. The majority of them were farmers but we need more land from the government. Food supplies arrive every month but if people can work, and stand on their two feet, it will give them resilience.” People with existing areas of expertise such as the cheery Andrews, who runs a seven-strong bakery operation that produces the camp’s bread in a giant clay oven, are encouraged to resume their career where possible. In another corner of the camp, women are trained to make and sell ecological charcoal. Most of the girls’ team are still in school, but Lucy is 18 and starting to make a living by sewing headwear. She hopes to become a doctor – “so that if you are ill you come to me and I’ll treat you” – while Fayiza wants to be a news journalist. Isaac emphasises that role models of any kind are vital for Minawao’s young women and believes football has a part to play. “Watching footballers around the world, people want to be like them,” he says. “It makes them want to play. It’s the same if you watch actors in films. These recreational activities keep us awake, give us good aspirations, because you think of the future and not what happened in the past. Everyone has their own star.” The sentiment is important even if, in practice, a straw poll of the team’s favourite player brings one answer. Sitting around a table in the small, spare library building a stone’s throw from the pitch, the team shout Ahmed Musa’s name in unison. The former Leicester player has deity-like status in Nigeria and, thrillingly, they were able to watch him play last month. Tickets were arranged for them to watch the Super Eagles face Sudan in Garoua, a four-hour drive away, during the Cup of Nations group stage. As their friends in Minawao watched via a satellite link, they posed for a photograph on the pitch. “I never thought I would be able to see these players in my whole life,” Fayiza says. For the players, as well as the accompanying Modu and Isaac, it was a first-ever stadium visit. When we meet Nigeria have long since been eliminated from the tournament, but the team are behind Cameroon, who are about to make their ultimately unsuccessful bid for a place in the final. “We cannot forget Nigeria because it’s our country, but we grew up here,” Lucy says. Back on the training pitch, they try to re-enact their heroes’ moves. It is tough: Modu’s team wear shirts intended for a boys’ team and most play in slip-on sandals. “Equipment is a problem for us,” Modu says. “We often get injuries because the girls don’t have proper shoes, and sometimes they’ll even draw blood. They often tell me we need more jerseys, more shoes.” Should those ever arrive, the hope is that future footballers in Minawao will benefit. “These girls are pioneers,” says Moise Amedje, one of UNHCR’s representatives in the region. “They are paving the way for the next generation.” They may not become professional players and they should not have to manage the pain barrier to play at all, but football has given Lucy and her friends a reason to look forward.",Sport/Football,‘We play to forget what happened’: football’s refuge for girls who fled atrocities,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/football-refuge-for-girls-who-fled-atrocities-minawao-refugee-camp-cameroon
2/5/2022,"Daylight is in short supply, paths are treacherous and the weather is both fickle and ferocious: winter is a challenging season for walking. And yet it is also the time when the landscape is laid bare, when we can appreciate the geology, spot the mosses, lichens and fungi, even see the birds more easily: especially the packs of fieldfares, redwings and waxwings hunting the last few berries in the hedge. The night sky is sharper for the cold, and celestial objects are seen more clearly. We asked six experts in different fields what to look out for on a winter walk, wherever that may be.  By Tristan GooleyI like to head up to a location like Black Down in West Sussex for some winter weather watching, but you might try a high vantage point in a city such as Edinburgh or London to see how the urban heat affects cloud formations. There are always plenty of clues about what to expect. First of all: the more types of clouds you can see, the worse the forecast. Clouds that are tall and wide tend to be unstable, so that’s a sign of poor conditions on the way. However, rain from those same tall clouds tends not to last long: like hailstorms – they are never long-lived, although they can be accompanied by powerful gusting winds. It’s when you see a grey blanket of cloud that gets lower before rain starts that you can expect bad weather to last for hours: that’s a new weather front moving in. Also, if you can see the base of the cloud and it’s jagged and blurred, you are about to get wet. A smooth, flatter base means you will probably stay dry. If you need to shelter, look for a conifer tree. Spruces are the best umbrellas of all – notice how dry the ground is under them. If you can find a sun pocket under a spruce, you’ll be surprised how toasty it is.Tristan Gooley is the author of The Secret World of Weather and an expert on navigation using natural signs. His books include The Natural Navigator and How to Read Water By John Wright Among the many trials and joys of a winter walk through woods, or beside a hedgerow, are the puzzles that present themselves along the way. Why do dead beech branches always turn black? What is that golden yellow slime crawling on the forest floor, or all those twiggy masses high up in trees? Those twiggy lumps could be any one of several phenomena: a rook’s nest, mistletoe, a squirrel drey, a burr or a canker. If they are on birch, they will almost certainly be witch’s broom, with a single tree sporting a dozen or more. Their long, thin branches emanate from a central mass several feet across. While clearly made of woody material, this mystery is grown by the tree under instructions supplied by a parasitic fungus, Taphrina betulina, for which it is forced to build a palatial home. Casting our eyes downwards, we might see one of winter’s great beauties, the scarlet elfcup. This fungus nestles in small groups among the fallen leaves, startling in its brilliance against the sombre winter colours. Surprisingly, it is edible, but it’s much too pretty to pick. The rarest of winter mysteries is “hair ice”. At temperatures close to zero, thousands of long, hair-like ice crystals can be exuded from the pores of a fallen, dead branch which has been infected by an otherwise unremarkable fungus, Exidiopsis effusa. The overall effect is of a branch with a luxuriant, grey hairdo. A long-established woodland like the New Forest is a good location to search for these mysteries, but any hedgerow, park or cemetery will do. My advice is to look up a professional teacher in your area via foragers-association.org. The Field Studies Council is also a highly respected organisation that teaches all aspects of natural history. I went on one of its courses 40 years ago and still remember it with enormous pleasure.John Wright is a mycologist, forager and home brewer, and author of River Cottage handbooks on Mushrooms, the Edible Seashore and Hedgerows. His latest work is A Spotter’s Guide to Countryside Mysteries By Patrick Norris Nighttime winter walks on the Northumberland coast can produce good stargazing experiences. In the dark, walking on a beach is easier – there are fewer obstacles. Just walking out of a pub such as the Jolly Fisherman in Craster and heading towards Dunstanburgh Castle can be amazing on a clear night. The aurora borealis, northern lights, can be excellent on the coast, especially from Lindisfarne, but it is a fickle phenomenon, not to be relied on. If you’re heading into the hills, maybe to a dark sky park or reserve, it’s good to check out locations in daylight. It’s vital to minimise light disturbance when you do arrive, so use red lights only. It takes around 20 minutes for your eyes to properly adjust, and any sudden white light will set you back. I take a reclining camping seat, but mats work well: they’re cheap and lightweight. Clear winter nights tend to be cold, so warm clothes, a hat, gloves and a warm blanket are essential, plus hot chocolate, coffee or soup if possible. I prefer 10x50 binoculars over a telescope – too fiddly to set up – but they can be heavy, so take lightweight pairs if you prefer. Once the excitement has settled down, especially if you have children, get ready for an extravagance of stars, shooting stars, satellites and planets. There are some useful apps, but watch out for phone-light spoiling your night sight; Night Sky and SkyView are both free. Another possibility is to visit an established observatory. In Northumberland we have Kielder, Battlesteads Hotel or the Twice Brewed Inn on Hadrian’s Wall. My favourite is the Breamish Valley in the Cheviot Hills. Other great locations are Walltown and Cawfields on Hadrian’s Wall: both are just off the B6318 and have plenty of parking, fixed stargazing information panels and toilets with good access.For meteor showers, check out the Meteor Calendar. The International Space Station is also a reliable, and predictable, sight.Patrick Norris was a Duke of Edinburgh awards volunteer before guiding walks with his own company, Footsteps. He works with Ingram Valley farm in the Northumberland national park, England’s first international dark sky park By Martin Curtis Fossil hunting is the perfect activity for the whole family, and you don’t need to be a palaeontologist or geologist. With simple techniques, you can easily find fossils with no need for tools – it’s all about training your eyes. Winter is the best time of year. We get more storms, rougher seas and rain, vital for breaking up material on the beaches that has fallen from the cliffs. On the Jurassic Coast [stretching from Dorset to east Devon] we get material from the entire Mesozoic era – Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. It’s the only place in the world where you can find that. When searching for fossils, look for unusual shapes, colours and textures, or anything that stands out from what you would typically find on the beach. It’s easier when rocks are wet, so walk near the water’s edge, if it’s safe to do so. For the same reason, fossil-hunting in the rain is often very productive. The safest time to be on the beach is roughly two hours before low tide and no more than two hours after. Stay away from the cliff base at all times while on the beach, and you must not climb on to the mudslides, as they are dangerous. The foreshore is the safest place to be. I’ve found all sorts of things there: ammonites, trilobites, teeth and even coprolites – fossilised shark poo.Martin Curtis is a mountain leader and guide at Jurassic Coast Guides, specialising in fossil-hunting walks along beaches near Charmouth and Lyme Regis. Britain’s best fossil sites are mostly coastal, and Martin’s insights apply equally to fossil locations as far apart as John O’Groats and Cornwall’s Maer Cliff. Get started on a guided walk By Dr Rebecca Yahr On bare trees, mosses and lichens are all the easier to spot – and these miniature wonders don’t fly away. For mosses, check at the base of a garden tree, or a shady lawn. In woodland you might find a whole landscape in miniature, made up of mosses. A 10x magnifying glass can transform your experience of something like a spiky forest of common haircap, Polytrichum commune. But my favourites are the lichens. There is something magical about these tiny ecosystems, actually fungi that farm algae or bacteria inside themselves to make food. Lichens are everywhere, but the richest diversity will be found in unspoilt clear-air regions with little human impact. Ballachuan Hazelwood, in Scotland, is the jewel in the crown for lichen lovers, but the Lakes, Dartmoor and Trossachs are also excellent. For information, I’d start with the British Lichen Society website; there are good blogs, too. Lichens form strappy tufts – the powder-dotted cartilage lichen Ramalina farinacea does this – or leafy rosettes on woodland trees, like oakmoss Evernia prunastri (which is neither limited to oaks, nor is it a moss). Oakmoss has a distinctly primitive-looking branching pattern, evenly in twos at every division and with white undersides. If you have old trees in clean air, you are almost certain to have these on the older twigs and younger branches. And, if you are in the west of Britain, where we have temperate rainforest, look out for the abundant “apple green” Flavoparmelia caperata, forming saucer-sized rosettes on trunks of trees, and the lettuce-sized lungwort Lobaria pulmonaria, named for its resemblance to human lungs. In moorland you can search for the intricately branched cushions of reindeer lichen, Cladonia portentosa, and the glowing yellow-green map lichen, Rhizocarpon geographicum, common on acidic rocks and roof slates.Dr Rebecca Yahr discovered a passion for the fascinating micro-worlds of lichens while working at the Archbold biological station in Florida. She is now resident lichenologist at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh By Darren Woodhead Winter is by far my favourite season for birdwatching, walking and painting – and I do all my work outside. The limited daylight hours give a natural deadline and the low, watery sun highlights the most subtle of shades among skeletal natural forms. There can be challenges, however: will the paint freeze, or will the wind rip the page off again? I advise going out alone, preferably before dawn. Try to walk silently. I carry a rucksack with a small selection of high-pigment tube watercolours in a folding metal palette, a variety of torn watercolour paper sheets clipped to a lightweight board, binoculars and a telescope. Tune in to the birdsong and the energy of the environment while looking out for something that catches your attention: for me, it can be unusual behaviour from a bird, a striking burst of light, or the natural composition of some vegetation … I never know. When the moment arrives, get started with the drawing or painting. I kneel on a weathered sleeping mat and begin making marks, using a couple of beloved simple oriental brushes. Hedgerows are very rewarding: all those gnarled hawthorns or coppiced beech hedgerows adorned with punky growths of rosehips, reaching out and waving in the bitter wind. Working direct in brush with watercolour requires an almost zen-like state for it to appear effortless. Watercolour, transparent by nature, hides nothing. When it works, the elation is majestic. Go for regular walks and you will discover areas of solitude, where if you’re lucky, a favourite subject can emerge. At the moment, mine is tree sparrows. Pools of mixed burned umber watercolour are perfect for their soft brown plumage, warming up the wash with a touch of burnt sienna and yellow on their heads, then cooler grey tones for the chest and flanks. Sap green captures the moss on winter branches, alongside some crimson. Carrying a wet painting for the rest of the walk can be a challenge in itself.Darren Woodhead is one of Britain’s leading nature artists and a lifelong birdwatching enthusiast.

2/5/2022,"UK football’s most powerful bodies are facing calls to follow the lead of the US in tackling gender-based violence, including by letting clubs suspend players suspected of abusive behaviour without pay. In a letter seen by the Guardian, the CEOs of the Football Association and the Premier League have been urged to decide “which side they are on when it comes to violence against women and girls”.  The letter has been sent by the feminist group Level Up, the End Violence Coalition and the Three Hijabis, who last year launched an anti-racism campaign after black England players were subjected to a torrent of abuse after the Euro 2020 final. It outlines demands including following the lead of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the NFL, where players suspected of domestic abuse, sexual violence or child abuse can be suspended without pay. It also calls for mandatory training for staff at every level on gender-based violence, a charter outlining minimum standards, clear sexual misconduct policies including disciplinary procedures, and prevention programmes in academies. “This week has seen football make the headlines for all the wrong reasons. It is clear that our beautiful game has an ugly underside when it comes to violence against women,” the letter states. “It’s time for the FA and Premier League to confront a culture of gender-based violence.” The Scottish club Raith Rovers made a U-turn on Thursday after days of mounting anger over its signing of David Goodwillie, who was ruled to be a rapist in a civil case in 2017. It comes against a backdrop of allegations against Premier League players including Mason Greenwood and Benjamin Mendy. Greenwood, a Manchester United striker, was released on bail on Wednesday after his arrest on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. Separately, the Manchester City defender Mendy is accused of nine offences, including rape and attempted rape, relating to six alleged victims. “This is not about individual clubs or players, it’s about the whole game, and the Premier League and FA [Football Association] need to lead from the top,” said Janey Starling, a co-director of Level Up, which this week launched a petition calling for action. “This is a huge opportunity. If the Premier League can implement a gender-based violence policy and if professional football in the UK will take a stand on this, it will have a huge impact across the rest of society. I genuinely believe they could have more influence than the government,” she said. Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said American football and baseball had shown that sports governing bodies could be more proactive. “We’ve seen the impact of campaigns to keep racism out of football in shaping fans’ attitudes and behaviours. Now it’s time for the sport to look at its problem with violence against women,” she said. In 2018 the former Chicago Cubs shortstop Addison Russell was suspended for 40 games without pay for violating the MLB’s domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy, despite not facing criminal charges after his ex-wife detailed physical, mental and emotional abuse. Since the policy was implemented in 2015, 14 players have been suspended for violating it, with suspensions ranging from 15 to 162 games. Five were placed on paid administrative leave. Shaista Aziz, a football fan and anti-racism campaigner, who along with Amna Abdullatif and Huda Jawad formed the Three Hijabis, said football was part of the “DNA of the UK” and had to seize the opportunity. “For football to wash its hands and look the other way in relation to misogyny and all forms of oppression and violence is just not acceptable,” she said. In a statement, the FA said it condemned violence and prejudice including misogyny, and it encouraged victims or witnesses of abuse to report to the police. It said it had an equality policy, every club had a code of conduct, and its regulatory framework allowed it to take action against anyone breaching its policies or regulations. “If incidents of this nature take place in a football environment, the FA will take the allegations extremely seriously and will take action within its jurisdiction. Any such case would be investigated once any criminal or statutory investigation is concluded,” it said. A Premier League spokesperson said it was developing a gender equality strategy to “address serious issues” including misogyny and violence against women, and it was talking to the Home Office about supporting work to tackle violence against women. Workshops in academies explored healthy relationships, consent, sexual harassment and bullying, it added. “The Premier League strongly condemns any form of abuse or violence against women and girls and takes these issues extremely seriously,” the spokesperson said.",News/Society,FA and Premier League urged to help tackle gender-based violence,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/05/fa-and-premier-league-urged-to-help-tackle-gender-based-violence
2/5/2022,"Unless your mortgage is already fixed for the long term, this week’s interest rate rise, following hot on the heels of December’s, is likely to have given you cause for concern. About 2 million borrowers are on variable rate deals of some kind, and many have already seen an increase in their repayments following the last base-rate rise. Thousands more are on fixed-rate deals that come to an end over the next few months. With other living costs rising, remortgaging might be a good bet. Some people will be able to save more than £200 a month, or in excess of £2,000 a year, just by making a fairly simple switch.  “Mortgages are the one aspect of good news here, because there is still something you can do about the cost,” says David Hollingworth at the broker L&C Mortgages. “You can ease the pressure elsewhere by taking appropriate action.” What “appropriate action” is, will depend on your circumstances, but you should, at least, start with a look at your current situation. Are you paying your lender’s standard variable rate (SVR), and, if so, how much is it? Are you on a special deal of some sort, and, if so, when does it end? If you jump ship early, are there any redemption charges to pay? These are fees that a lender charges when you pay off your mortgage before the end of a special offer rate, and are usually equivalent to a set percentage of your outstanding mortgage debt. It is likely that you have just been hit with an increase in your monthly bill linked to December’s Bank of England decision, and you now face another 0.25 percentage point rise. But not all borrowers are facing higher costs yet. HSBC is one large lender that has not passed on the increase, and Yorkshire building society has held its SVR, too. The SVRs of these two are quite different: HSBC’s is 3.54%, while Yorkshire’s is 4.49%. If you are on the latter, you could reduce your monthly outgoings considerably by moving to a better deal. Hollingworth gives the example of switching from Yorkshire’s SVR to a market-leading five-year fix at First Direct which has a rate of 1.54% and a £490 fee. That would cut your monthly repayments by £222 and, over 12 months, that would save you £2,169 once you’ve taken the fee into account. However, if you have slipped on to the SVR because your mortgage is nearing an end, you might not be able to benefit. “With a smaller mortgage, even low costs will start to deplete the savings,” Hollingworth says. “If you’ve got, say, two years left to run, you’re probably best off looking to your existing lender to see if it can do a better rate over the remaining time.” You will definitely feel the effect of any interest rate rises, and may be getting concerned by predictions that the base rate could hit 1.5% next year. It makes sense to shop around if your deal has no early repayment charges (ERCs) – unless you chose that deal because you wanted the option to pay it off early, or there was another reason why you wanted flexibility that still stands. If you do have ERCs to consider, check how much they are. The percentage usually goes down as the end of the deal looms, so the longer you have had the mortgage, the less you will need to pay. But anything you do pay to escape the mortgage will need to be made up in savings. “You might end up out of pocket,” Hollingworth says. Say, for example, you owe £150,000 and your mortgage comes with a 1% ERC in the final year of the tracker rate, that means you will pay £1,500 to move now. To make the ERC worth paying, you need to think that rates are moving upwards so quickly that whatever you can lock into at the end of your deal will cost you more than that over the term of the next deal you lock in to. If you are in the last year of your tracker rate, you do not need to wait until the end to take up a new deal. Many lenders let you lock in and complete six months later. If you find a deal with free legals and a free valuation and opt to add the arrangement fee to your mortgage, you won’t need to pay a penny now, says Nick Mendes of the broker John Charcol. “If mortgage rates go up, you’ve secured a deal based on what’s on offer today, but you haven’t completed, so if they do go down you can apply for something else,” he says. Hollingworth has one word of caution: if it’s a new fixed-rate, check what the end date is, and “make sure you’re not eating into the benefit period”. You are currently cushioned from the rises, but may be starting to worry about what happens next. You also have the option of applying for a new deal up to six months before you need to switch – make sure you check if the lender does have that long a window for completion before you sign up. Mendes says that for anyone looking to remortgage, lenders have loosened restrictions on loans to the self-employed, but are looking closely at affordability. He warns that a flurry of buynow, pay later borrowing could cause a problem if you want to take out a new mortgage. “We are starting to see household incomes stretched and if people turn to other forms of credit that could cause them problems,” he says. The cost of locking in your mortgage for 10 years has fallen after Lloyds reduced the rate on its decade-long fix to 1.66% for remortgagers. Experts say it is the cheapest 10-year deal they can remember, and could lead to other lenders offering similar rates over the same period. The mortgage has a £1,000 fee and early redemption fees starting at 6% for the first five years and then gradually falling to 1% in the final year. It is available up to 60% loan to value. Home movers can get a rate of 1.68% from Halifax via brokers. “To lock in for 10 years below 2% is amazing,” says L&C’s David Hollingworth. Nick Mendes says that some borrowers feel uncomfortable about locking in for so long because of the charges if things change. However, the mortgage is portable, which means that if you move house, you can transfer it.",Lifestyle/Money,Mortgages: switching could save £200 a month as interest rates rise,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/05/mortgages-switching-save-interest-rates-rise
2/5/2022,"She is fiercely loyal to Donald Trump. But when the former US president came to her home city and praised coronavirus vaccines, Flora Moore did something she never thought possible. She booed him.  “He said take the vaccine but we all booed and said no,” she recalled of Trump’s event with broadcaster Bill O’Reilly in Orlando, Florida. “He heard us loud and clear because the Amway Center was packed. We let him know ‘no’ and a couple of us even hollered out, ‘It’s killing people!’” There is no scientific basis to the claim that the vaccines are killing people. In fact, they have demonstrably saved thousands of lives. But Moore is indicative of the extreme anti-vaccine sentiment consuming the base of the Republican party – a monster that Trump himself can no longer control. America is exhausted by a pandemic still killing more than 2,400 people a day, the overwhelming majority of whom are unvaccinated, bringing the total death toll to 900,000. In more conventional times, Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which developed vaccines in record time, would be a source of pride for his voters. Even his successor, Joe Biden, has praised the initiative, stating: “Thanks to the prior administration and our scientific community, America was one of the first countries to get the vaccine.” But Trump’s eagerness to claim credit has been undone by conservatives’ backlash against Biden’s efforts to legally require worker vaccinations, which they cast as a threat to individual freedom. The ex-president’s customary applause turned to jeers when he encouraged supporters to get vaccinated and told O’Reilly that he received a booster himself. What was arguably Trump’s most important legacy from an otherwise disastrous pandemic response, and a divisive four-year presidency, has turned into a political liability, threatening to turn his own fans against him. Laurie Garrett, an award-winning science writer, observed: “It’s probably the only time his base has ever booed him about anything. If he can no longer brag about Operation Warp Speed, what can he brag about regarding how he handled Covid?” The anti-vaccine fervor has been stoked by some Republican politicians as well as rightwing media. Last month, Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a notorious sceptic, gave writer Alex Berenson a platform to baselessly proclaim, “The mRNA Covid vaccines need to be withdrawn from the market now. No one should get them. No one should get boosted. No one should get double-boosted.” The web has also become a place for unscientific conspiracy theories to thrive. Moore, the Trump supporter in Florida, said she gets her information from her 30,000 followers on Facebook as well as Telegram, Twitter and YouTube. She said: “I don’t trust the government. I don’t trust the pharmaceutical companies. I’m active in politics here and found out lots of people were having complications and dropping dead. There’s a lot of jobs I wont’t even take because they want me to get a vaccine.” The commercial analyst, who is in her 40s, refuses to wear a face mask in restaurants or at work. Her radical views on the issue outweigh even her faith in Trump. “I trust him on certain things, but he’s not my God,” she said. Trump appears to have heeded the shift and recalibrated. At a rally in Conroe, Texas, last Saturday, where anti-vaccine views were again rampant, he channeled the crowd’s anger towards Biden’s mandate for federal government workers (a similar mandate for businesses was rejected by the supreme court). “It is time for the American people to declare independence from every last Covid mandate,” Trump said to cheers. “We have to tell this band of hypocrites, tyrants and racists that we’re done with having them control our lives, mess with our children and close our businesses. We’re moving on from Covid.” He then added briskly: “We did a great job. Operation Warp Speed has been praised by everybody but it’s now time to move on.” Notably in the remarks he did not use the word “vaccines” at all. It was a pivot that appeared to acknowledge the political threat and it is enough to satisfy voters such as Moore. She commented: “I think he’s gotten the message that he can say he took the vaccine and nothing happened to him and if you desire to take it, take it, but if you don’t want to, leave it alone.” The number of anti-vaxxers in the Republican base is hard to estimate. The Guardian interviewed half a dozen Trump rally attendees last week and found that most had got the shots. They included Jered Pettis, from Phoenix, Arizona, who had changed his mind on the topic. “We were totally anti-vaccine, didn’t really believe in it, didn’t want to get it,” he said. “Then a friend got it pretty severe: he could hardly breathe and felt like his head was going to explode. He didn’t go to the hospital but he was very, very sick to the point where he told me, ‘Hey, Jered. I’m very thankful for every breath of air that I get now’. After I had seen and heard one of my best friends go through that, I changed my mind in a heartbeat.” Pettis received two Pfizer doses, then caught the virus just over a month ago. “So thank God, because I would have been a lot sicker than I was. It was almost like a mild cold. I could just imagine if I was not vaccinated.” The 50-year-old exterior designer describes the recent booing as “absolutely ridiculous” and believes that Trump deserves credit, not criticism, for the vaccines. “Even though you may be anti-vaccine, you’ll change your mind if you get sick or you get somebody around you that dies.” Even so, deep-seated suspicion of the vaccines could deprive Republicans of what might have been a powerful boast going into November’s midterm elections. Garrett, author of The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance, points out that counties that voted for Trump in 2020 have a far higher mortality rate than counties that voted for Biden. “The Republicans are in a bind,” she said. “They are experiencing a higher death rate in their ranks and it is directly linked to their positions on Covid. The one thing they could claim as a great benefit that was saving lives, vaccination, they’re now being compelled by their own base to renounce.” Vaccine scepticism has never been a solely rightwing stance. Some libertarians on the left have opposed profit-driven big pharma and championed holistic alternatives. But on Covid-19, at least, this group appears to be significantly smaller than the conservative holdouts. Garrett said: “All the polls are showing tremendous partisan differential in everything to do with vaccines and it has been increasing steadily for the last two years. It’s very much driven by the rightwing myths and narratives around Covid. “There still are some of those ex-hippie types that don’t want to get vaccinated, but if you look at the breakdown on political sentiment about vaccination, willingness to get a third booster or even a fourth if it becomes available, it’s so Democrat. It’s incredible” Garrett said. “I never thought in my life I would see something like this. It is an absolute partisan divide and it’s widening.” About nine in 10 Democrats and six in 10 Republicans have been vaccinated, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, while 62% of Democrats and just 32% of Republicans have been both vaccinated and boosted. The trend suggests that Republican candidates for the midterm elections are likely to follow Trump’s lead in attacking Biden’s mandates rather than celebrating Trump’s vaccines. But if any Republican can outflank Trump on the issue ahead of the 2024 presidential election, it may be the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, who has refused to say whether he received a booster. The New York Times reported that Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster, found Trump’s lead over DeSantis closing to just nine points among party members who like both men. Monika McDermott, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, said: “They can get disgruntled with Trump, certainly, and DeSantis is the obvious choice for people who are anti-vax. But giving up on Trump is like giving up on their dreams at this point. Trump was their savior. Trump brought about the wholesale remasculization of that portion of the American psyche.” Indeed, despite the possible split with his Make America Great Again movement on vaccines, Trump remains by far the biggest beast in the Republican jungle and this week announced that he is entering 2022 with a staggering $122m in campaign funds. Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman active on social media, said: “I talk to the extremists all the time and I agree with Trump’s people that they’re locked with him. They’re not going to anybody else.” Walsh finds that 90% of the base are anti-vaccine, do not believe Biden won and either have no problem with the 6 January insurrection or regard it as a patriotic day. “You could not as a Republican candidate run for office if you told people to get vaccinated or if you said Joe Biden won fair and square,” he added. “If you said either one of those two things, you couldn’t win a Republican primary.”",News/US news,‘Trump is not my God’: how the former president’s only vaccine victory turned sour,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/05/donald-trump-vaccine-republicans-operation-warp-speed
2/5/2022,"The government’s plan to overhaul the air passenger compensation scheme has been described as a step backwards for consumers, leading to “small amounts of compensation that often won’t be worth claiming”. Earlier this week the Department for Transport (DfT) announced it is consulting on proposals to overhaul the air passengers’ rights rules – but only for flights within the UK.  The move, described by the government as “another Brexit win”, will lead to a two-tier system, with the UK scheme operating alongside the original EC 261 rules that were adopted before Britain left the EU, and still apply to international flights in and out of UK airports. The DfT is limited in its ability to change rules around foreign flights because of the international conventions on air travel. Currently, someone on an internal flight from Edinburgh to London is entitled to claim £220 once their flight has been delayed three hours, unless the cause was extraordinary circumstances such as bad weather. The compensation payable is fixed and is not linked to the price paid by the passenger. Long-haul travellers on a flight from Japan to the UK are entitled to £520 if delayed four hours or more, alongside other beneficial terms such as rerouting had the flight been cancelled. The DfT is now proposing a system akin to the train delay compensation scheme for internal flights. On the face of it, passengers could be better off as partial refunds would start at only one hour’s delay. However, the sum paid is related to the fare. The proposed scale is:  One hour to 1hr 59min: 25% of the ticket price.  Two hours to 2hr 59min: 50% of the ticket price.  Three hours and above: a full ticket refund. The change would mean a passenger who had paid £50 for a domestic flight would receive £12.50 back after a 90-minute delay. It is unclear whether the “fare paid” would include any extras such as luggage payments but it is likely it would. Currently, that same passenger would get nothing until a delay of three hours, when they would receive £220. The government has not said whether the extraordinary circumstance get-out would still apply. Most train operators provide refunds for delays that are beyond their control but airlines are subject to far more outside influences, such as air traffic problems, and would probably resist having to pay out where they were not at fault. At the same time, the DfT has proposed that all airlines must sign up to an aviation alternative dispute resolution scheme. This, it claims, would make it easier for passengers to escalate complaints without the need to go to court, although this has a distinctly mixed success rate in the energy sector. Currently, airline membership to ADRs is only voluntary. It also proposes giving the Civil Aviation Authority strengthened powers, including the right to fine airlines directly for breaches. There are also long-overdue improved rights for wheelchair users. Bott and Co, a legal firm that specialises in flight compensation, said the government’s own figures suggest the average compensation payable will drop from £220 to about £23.60. “In theory, the changes expose the airlines to more compensation. However, the consultation acknowledges that, in reality, far fewer people will actually have the impetus to make a claim,” it said. “The net result is that the airlines will save money because passengers will be disincentivised to make a claim. If compensation is going to be reduced to such a low level then it should be paid out automatically.” The consumer advocate Helen Dewdney, who runs the Complaining Cow website, welcomed the move. She argued that the current EU rules disproportionally penalise low-cost carriers. “A fairer system for both business and consumers has to be a good thing,” she said. Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: “Far too many passengers have felt ignored or had to battle for compensation from airlines when things go wrong, so proposals to give the aviation regulator stronger powers, including the ability to fine airlines that consistently flout consumer law, are welcome. “However, there are concerns that the plans set out in this consultation could be a bad deal for consumers if they result in a system that does not treat all passengers fairly. They could also lead to fewer incentives for airlines to take the rights of consumers seriously and set a bad precedent that could then be extended to international flights. “The government needs to provide passengers with reassurance that they will get fair compensation for the often serious disruption of a delayed flight and must ensure that all eligible passengers actually receive what they are owed through a system with rules that can be enforced.” Guardian Money has looked at the rules and fears that one of the unintended consequences of the UK adopting its own rules could be that more internal flights are cancelled. Prior to the introduction of the EU rules, airlines would regularly cancel flights at the last minute to save money, sometimes leaving passengers in the middle of nowhere without financial penalty. With two sets of passengers in, say, London and Paris vying for the last available plane, the low-cost carriers could opt to cancel the flight with the least financial loss, which could well be the UK flight.",Lifestyle/Money,UK flight compensation plan will slash average payouts,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/05/uk-flight-compensation-plan-will-slash-average-payouts
