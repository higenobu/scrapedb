5/12/2022,"Chinese taxi app Didi has told staff it has put plans for major international expansions on hold until at least 2025 and cut half its UK employees amid pressure from Beijing on one of its most prominent tech companies. Didi Chuxing has been on the back foot since last summer when the Cyberspace Administration of China, a powerful regulator, banned the country’s dominant ride-hailing company from listing its app on mobile app stores in the country. The ban came only days after the company floated on the New York stock exchange, and sent shockwaves around the Chinese tech sector. The move was widely seen by analysts as an attempt by the ruling Communist party to rein in the country’s tech companies following rapid growth in their market value and power. Didi, which is backed by Japanese investment house Softbank, in December announced that it would delist its share instruments from New York, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the initial public offering, according to the company’s latest annual report. Shares that were worth nearly $80bn (£65bn) when it listed were valued at only $7.6bn on Tuesday evening. Didi had previously planned to launch in the UK and Europe, with an office in London that would have overseen a direct challenge to other ride-hailing and food delivery companies such as the US’s Uber and Estonia’s Bolt. Uber is also Didi’s second-largest shareholder after pulling out of China in exchange for a 12% stake in its rival. However, it paused that expansion in August following the Chinese crackdown, and in a February meeting told staff in several markets that it would pause until 2025, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. Didi last month said it would also pull out of South Africa. The company had about 40 employees in the UK, several of whom moved from the Latin American markets where Didi retains a strong presence. About half of those staff will remain in London but work on other markets following a consultation. Didi has recently announced expansions to Chile and the Dominican Republic, and also has strong positions in Mexico and Brazil. There are other signs that Didi may be subject to Chinese government pressure, including a rapid U-turn on a decision to pull out of Russia, an ally of China, as first first reported by Nikkei. On 21 February, three days before Vladimir Putin’s regime invaded Ukraine, Didi announced to staff that it would pull out of Russia by 4 March. The company wrote to drivers informing them of the decision, but within five days – shortly after the invasion began – it had announced it would remain in the country. A spokesperson for Didi did not comment on the company’s plans beyond highlighting its recent expansions in South America and Egypt.",News/Business,Chinese taxi app Didi shelves plans for major overseas expansion,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/chinese-taxi-app-didi-international-expansion-shelved
5/12/2022,"A Texas appeals court must reconsider its decision to uphold a five-year conviction for Crystal Mason, the Texas woman sentenced to prison for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election, the state’s highest criminal court ruled on Wednesday. Mason showed up to the polls to vote in 2016, while on supervised release – which is similar to probation – for a federal tax felony. She cast a provisional ballot at the urging of election workers, which was ultimately rejected because people with felony convictions in Texas cannot vote while they are serving any part of a federal sentence. Mason said she had no idea she was ineligible to vote, and an official from the federal probation office testified at her trial that they never informed her she was ineligible. A local judge in Tarrant county, where Mason lives, convicted her of illegally voting in 2018 and sentenced her to five years in prison. An appeals court upheld that ruling in 2020. The Texas court of criminal appeals said the an appellate court had “erred by failing to require proof that the appellant had actual knowledge that it was a crime for her to vote while on supervised release”. Mason has remained out of prison on an appeal bond during that time. Her appeal to the Texas court of criminal appeals, Texas’ highest criminal court, was her last chance. The case attracted significant national attention because of the severity of Mason’s sentence.

5/12/2022,"Owen Jones lays bare the tactical weaknesses in Keir Starmer’s Labour (Starmer gambled Labour’s fortunes on his integrity – no wonder he’s in deep trouble, 9 May). It doesn’t work to increasingly appease the right, because in our current divisive political era, one can never appease enough when the game is just a zero-sum turf war. So Beergate could be an indicative test case. If he’s fined, either Keir Starmer ends up backing down on the value of integrity, thus saving Boris Johnson and then having to tack further right to ingratiate himself in an increasingly hostile environment. Or, he could take the poison pill and allow himself to be deposed in favour of a new, capable leader. Learning from this is the most important thing. Centrists do, in fact, need at least the moderate left wing of the party, and the coalition of the Labour movement is better for it. Labour does need to collaborate with all opposition parties. And it needs to stop triangulating itself to impotence over the “red wall” and create a bold, pro-Europe vision that can demolish it, along with our deepening illiberalism.Julian SkidmoreBirmingham  When I joined Labour in 2015, it was not because I was a radical, leftist “Corbynista”, it was because the party was offering a socialist agenda for the first time in my voting life. I was more excited by John McDonnell as a chancellor than I was by Jeremy Corbyn as leader; it was their manifesto I was interested in. Of course the rightwing press were terrified. I wish Labour would devote its energies to standing up for the people who are really struggling and the people who want to support them. Start giving us a message we can get behind rather than following votes and you will find that you leave the rightwing press behind.Imelda O’BrienHornsey, London  Simon Jenkins is wrong (You say Partygate, I say Beergate - let’s call the whole thing off, 9 May). Equating the prolonged, contemptuous and now shown to be illegal shenanigans in Downing Street with Keir Starmer’s team meal at the end of a day’s campaigning is akin to comparing cancer with the irritation of an ingrowing toenail, or perhaps more appropriately, schizophrenia with mild disappointment when one’s football team has lost. To call it quits, as Jenkins suggests, is to hand yet another victory to the unprincipled sections of the biased press that wield such massively disproportional influence in our democracy.Peter WrigleyBirstall, Yorkshire  Keir Starmer should not allow the rightwing press to govern his priorities (Damned when you do: why Starmer can’t win with the Mail, 10 May).

5/12/2022,"As a retired drama teacher of many years’ experience, I wholeheartedly agree with all that Dr Geoff Readman says (Letters, 6 May). Over the years many parents questioned the place of drama in the curriculum, saying: “I do not want my child to go on stage.” I would then explain that the purpose of drama in schools was not to produce the actors of tomorrow, but rather to give every student the opportunity to explore a wide range of issues. The hope and intention was to help young people to grow in self-confidence and to enable them to express their opinions in a thoughtful, articulate and challenging fashion. Perhaps it was this aspect that worried the authorities. All the world may be a stage, but there are those who are only happy if we stick to an acceptable script; they do not want too many hecklers.Catherine GriffinDolwyddelan, Conwy  Dr Readman (quoting Mark Rylance) was so right regarding the teaching of drama in schools. It should be noted that the favouring of Stem subjects to the detriment of humanities in our universities is also cause for concern. Staff in various English, history, theology and archaeology departments have recently been threatened with redundancy. Lecturers feel that it is only a matter of time before these departments close for good and non-Russell Group institutions revert to technical colleges.

5/12/2022,"Perhaps it was the new opinion poll that dropped just hours before the final leaders debate of the 2022 campaign – the one suggesting Labor was currently on track to win 80 seats and claim government. Or perhaps these two men were genuinely chastened after acting like a pair of pugilistic numpties during Sunday night’s poorly moderated shit blizzard on the Nine network. I’m not sure what triggered the radical change in the disposition of the combatants, but Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese were visibly nervous at the start of Wednesday night’s debate. Perhaps the explanation was as simple as two political opponents comprehending the gravity of the moment. The third election debate was a dignified, sober, affair that rose above its mild game show atmospherics, and now that the debates are done, only 10 days remain before Australians will decide who governs for the next three years. Morrison knows his prime ministership is on the clock – the prime minister’s nerves betray his concern that his bag of tactical tricks may not turn this contest. And Albanese also knows a catastrophic stuff up will end his chances of victory and plunge Labor right back into the despair of election night in 2019. The final election debate traversed all the predictable topics. But given the political debate about wages has dominated the past 48 hours on the hustings, that issue was front and centre on Wednesday night. Albanese again made the case for the wages of Australia’s lowest-paid workers to keep pace with inflation but chose to emphasise the independence of the Fair Work Commission when it came to decision making. While Albanese is making a moral case for fair compensation, he’s also yet to commit to making a submission to the FWC to buttress his own argument. Scott Morrison for his part is in favour of wage increases as a theoretical proposition but apparently not a wage increase commensurate with the current headline inflation rate because that “can feed into inflation which pushes up interest rates and pushes up the cost of living even more”. “If Mr Albanese thinks small businesses around the country can have a 5% increase in their wages bill on top of all the other things they’re facing … then people won’t be worrying about what their wages are, they will be worrying about whether they have a job,” Morrison said on Wednesday night. Morrison is attempting to use this late-campaign wages parable to land the definitive proof point that Albanese is “a loose unit” who makes stuff up as he goes along, and is therefore unworthy of the keys to the Lodge. “Loose unit” is not language I would deploy in Morrison’s place, not because it’s boorish, but because this cut-through locution surely reminds voters of the surfeit of loose units on his own side. If we are doing a roll call of loose units we could start with Barnaby Joyce, who before his unfortunate nosebleed, unleashed a sequence of incomprehensible analogies at the National Press Club earlier on Wednesday, likening his own government to curtains and Tony Abbott’s safeguard mechanism to a ceiling fan (I think – it was hard to keep up). At one point during Wednesday night’s debate, Morrison expressed horror or derision-adjacent sentiment about the prospect of the Labor frontbencher Tanya Plibersek possibly serving on the national security committee (NSC) of cabinet in an Albanese government. I hate to break it to the prime minister, but I’m reasonably confident this Plibersek eventuality would be significantly less startling for many voters (including many Liberals) than the present reality of Joyce being the NSC’s deputy chair. But returning to the wages debate – earlier in the campaign, the prime minister argued Albanese had no power to do anything about wages. Now he’s arguing the Labor leader wants to do too much. What the prime minister seems to have lost sight of as he attempts to elevate his “Albanese is an unacceptable risk” message is he is advocating for a real wage cut to make his point, and a real wage cut for the Australians finding it hardest to make ends meet. This would be a brave stance politically at the best of times but it is particularly brave given there is no evidence wages are generating inflationary pressure in the Australian economy at this point in time – a fact that has been noted consistently by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The central bank has signalled for months that’s a key difference between Australia and other jurisdictions now battling surging inflation. Real wages in Australia have been going backwards for yonks – that’s a real-world, lived experience that everyone understands, particularly now the price of essential goods and services is rising. Perhaps that’s why Seven’s audience of undecided voters in key marginal seats gave the final election debate to Albanese.",News/Australia news,The PM previously said Albanese had no power to do anything about wages – now he’s arguing the Labor leader wants to do too much | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/the-pm-previously-said-albanese-had-no-power-to-do-anything-about-wages-now-hes-arguing-the-labor-leader-wants-to-do-too-much
5/12/2022,"Undocumented people who travel from the Ukraine to the UK via Ireland could be considered for removal to Rwanda, a senior Home Office official has told MPs. During the same select committee hearing, a minister refused to say under repeated questioning whether Ukrainians who arrive in the UK across the Channel by boat could also be sent to the central African country. The exchanges occurred at the home affairs select committee where the minister, Tom Pursglove, was unable to point to any calculations that the government’s relocation policy would reduce the number of people arriving in the UK in small boats. Some Conservative MPs have criticised Ireland’s decision to lift all restrictions for refugees fleeing war, claiming it would create a back door to the UK, leaving the country vulnerable to potential criminal elements. It has been pointed out that the common travel area means that Ukrainians who do not pass British security checks or are left waiting for visas to arrive could simply reach the UK by travelling to Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic and then getting a ferry to the UK. Stuart C McDonald, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson and a committee member, asked Dan Hobbs, the director of asylum, protection and enforcement, about Ukrainians crossing into Northern Ireland from Ireland. “Are they within the scope of this policy or are they not?” he said. Hobbs replied: “Depending on the individual circumstances they may not fall in the ‘inadmissibility’ criteria.” McDonald said: “You are leaving open the possibility that you can cross from Dublin to Belfast and conceivably end up in Rwanda.” Earlier, Diana Johnson, the chair of the committee, asked Pursglove if Ukrainians who travelled to the UK by small boat would be ruled “inadmissible” and therefore could be removed. Pursglove, the minister for justice and tackling illegal migration, replied: “There is absolutely no reason why any Ukrainian should be getting into a small boat and paying a people smuggler to get into the UK.” When asked what modelling was used to give the “evidence base for this decision”, the minister replied: “This is a new and untested policy at this point in time. I do think that in the fullness of time we will see this policy, as part of a wider package that we are introducing, really shift the dynamic.” Johnson said that it sounded like modelling had not been carried out. Pursglove replied: “I would be delighted to hear an alternative.” The two safe and legal routes under which Ukrainian refugees can enter the UK – the Ukraine family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme – have been beset by delays. The latest government data shows that 37,400 of 125,100 applicants have so far arrived in Britain. Under the scheme announced last month by the home secretary, Priti Patel, the UK will pay for people seeking asylum who are deemed to have arrived “illegally” to be sent to Rwanda, where their claims will be processed. In theory, they will be granted asylum or given refugee status in the country. Boris Johnson said “tens of thousands” of unlawful migrants would be removed to Rwanda. Documents released by the government on Monday show that the Rwandan government has managed to process a maximum of 307 asylum cases in a single year since 2016. Joanna Cherry, attending the session from the joint committee on human rights, asked Pursglove if he accepted reports by the US state department, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch documenting “unlawful or arbitrary killings”, along with forced disappearances and torture by the Rwandan government. Pursglove said that “overall Rwanda is a safe and secure country” to use for resettlement, arguing that there were “no systematic breaches” of human rights obligations in the east African country. The government announced on Monday that the process of removing people to Rwanda would begin over the next few weeks. Responding to the hearing, Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “This government has now openly acknowledged it is intent on treating any person fleeing war or oppression from around the world as a commodity to be shipped to Rwanda. This includes those fleeing the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and Afghanistan right now. It is appallingly cruel and will cause great human suffering. “We urge the government to immediately rethink its plans and focus on operating an orderly, humane and fair asylum system.”",News/UK news,"Ukraine refugees who enter UK via Ireland may be sent to Rwanda, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/ukraine-refugees-who-enter-uk-via-ireland-may-be-sent-to-rwanda-mps-told
5/12/2022,"Hong Kong’s national security police have arrested 90-year-old Cardinal Joseph Zen, one of Asia’s most senior and outspoken Catholic clerics, along with three others who helped run a now-disbanded humanitarian charity for protesters, according to local media reports. Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong, the singer and actor Denise Ho, the lawyer Margaret Ng and the scholar Hui Po-keung were detained by Hong Kong’s national security police, reports said. The arrests were apparently related to their roles as trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which provided legal aid and other financial help to people who took part in the 2019 pro-democracy protests that were quashed by security forces. Hui was arrested at the airport as he was about to board a flight to Germany on Tuesday, local media reported. Another trustee, Cyd Ho, is already in jail for her alleged involvement in illegal assemblies. Last year, the city’s police department said in a statement that it was investigating the charity for suspected violations of the national security law. The fund has now been scrapped after the disbandment of a company that had helped receive donations through a bank account. Hui, an adjunct associate professor of cultural studies at Lingnan University, had once taught the exiled political activist Nathan Law. “If you want to punish someone, you can always find an excuse,” Law, who now lives in Britain, wrote on his Facebook page in response to Hui’s arrest. In 2020, Cardinal Zen made a personal appeal to the Vatican in a letter, urging Pope Francis to leave politics out of the selection of Catholic bishops in the Chinese territory. He did not manage to meet the pope because, according to local media, the Holy See was at the time engaged in discussions with Beijing on the renewal of a power-sharing agreement on the ordination of bishops in the Chinese mainland. This week’s arrests were the authorities’ latest move in enforcing the controversial national security law, which was imposed on the city in June 2020. The legislation bars secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. They also came less than a week after the incoming chief executive, John Lee, was selected by a small number of elite voters on Sunday. The arrests have drawn condemnation from activists and politicians. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a China-focused cross-party alliance of parliamentarians from democratic countries, said they “marked a new and deeply worrying phase in the crackdown upon what remains of Hong Kong’s civil society”. In the UK, Labour’s shadow minister for Asia and Pacific, Catherine West, said in a tweet that the arrests “are a further demonstration of China’s aim to stamp out opposition in Hong Kong, and are completely at odds with the freedoms promised to Hong Kong”. She urged the British government to “work with international partners to demand the release of those detained”. Although Beijing and Hong Kong authorities insisted the law had brought stability to Hong Kong after the 2019 mass demonstrations, activists pointed out that since the enactment of the legislation, at least 175 people have been arrested and more than 110 have been charged.

5/12/2022,"Coldplay had a head full of dreams this week when they announced the details of a low-emission world tour driven by concerns for sustainability. Some of the green interventions are well-meaning, others are just gimmicks, such as a kinetic dance floor that generates electricity from the movement of fans. However, the detail of some of the proposed climate measures would appal even the mildly eco-minded. Perhaps worst of all is the partnership with Neste – a Finnish oil refining and marketing corporation that will provide the band with “sustainable aviation fuels” for flights and “renewable diesel” for tour transportation and stage power generation. Neste claims to be the world’s biggest biofuel company, processing 1.3m tonnes of palm oil and palm oil products into fuel in 2019, according to Friends of the Earth. Biofuels are composed of animal or plant waste, such as ethanol derived from maize, and are therefore marketed as “renewable”. The problems start with the huge land area growing crops for biofuel can require, often driving land grabs and presenting insurmountable challenges to food security. Besides this, biofuel production is hardly a climatic or ecological paradise – it causes severe emissions and habitat and biodiversity loss through deforestation. Neste claims to be “uniquely positioned” to supply fuels “produced from 100% renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil”. They neglect to mention the other less savoury sources that end up in sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel, such as animal fats and what many authorities consider to be byproducts of palm oil – which in the past has been linked to deforestation and human rights abuses. A spokesperson from Neste said “conventional palm oil” was not used as a “raw material” in the Coldplay collaboration. You could excuse the band’s headlong dive into what critics have called “greenwash” as a rush of blood to the head – had they not announced a pause on touring in 2019 until they could do so carbon neutrally. Three years later, they thought halfway was good enough, with their 2022 tour projected to be 50% lower in emissions than their last, with the other half achieved through offsetting. Decarbonising live music is necessary, laudable and a daunting task. But, like many facets of the climate world, the real routes to cutting emissions are rarely sexy. Coldplay are not the first to explore this, with Radiohead attempting a low-carbon tour in 2008, making use of alternative travel and local equipment hiring. More recent contenders for green rockstars include Massive Attack, who have argued that the challenge is “to avoid more pledges, promises and greenwashing headlines and instead embrace seismic change”. The Bristolian trio commissioned a report by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, which outlines a roadmap for super low-carbon live music. It doesn’t suggest bikes to power a stadium (another Coldplay stunt) or jets run on palm oil byproducts. The findings are less eye-catching, but more precise. Massive Attack’s report suggests less aviation, rather than celebrating alternative fuels, is necessary. Scepticism of sustainable aviation fuels, after all, is justified: they have been promised for decades, but only accounted for 0.01% of jet fuel in 2019. According to a study by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 2019, 328 new large bio-refineries would need to be built every year by 2035 to swap all jet fuel for biofuel in international aviation, costing roughly $29-115bn a year. Other suggestions to decarbonise the music industry include hiring kit and crew locally, using public transport for personnel and electric vehicles where possible for vital kit transport. This is a far cry from Neste’s biodiesel, which will truck around Coldplay’s equipment. Research suggests that when scarce “waste oils” are used to produce biodiesel, it displaces their use in other sectors, which then have to turn to other sources like palm oil. Then there’s the freighting of equipment around the world. Solutions here include developing and promoting “plug and play” models for venues, reducing the need to freight heavy items around the world, and the standardisation of equipment worldwide. Importantly, Massive Attack eschew carbon offsets, currently the go-to climate solution for most eco-minded people in the music industry. Coldplay say they will make their tour “neutral” by offsetting the other half through technologies like carbon capture and storage. But campaigners and climate scientists have long argued offsetting should be reserved only for “hard-to-decarbonise” sectors – think the cement industry, not gigs. Otherwise, it simply provides a quick fix excuse for the rich and famous who plan to pollute now and offset later. Of course, not all of Coldplay’s efforts are for show, and it is an admirable step down the path to zero-emissions music. But to really make an impact, more consideration should be put into what they are indirectly promoting with their emissions reductions schemes. Perhaps this could start with a conscious uncoupling from Neste.

He is also understood to have handed in his notice at Kolkata Knight Riders, leaving him free to take up a new role after their final game of the Indian Premier League season next Wednesday. A formal announcement from the England and Wales Cricket Board is expected soon, McCullum having emerged as favourite since the interview process was completed. The Indian Express reported on Wednesday that KKR’s players have been told about McCullum’s imminent departure, with an unnamed insider quoted as saying: “He informed us that he won’t be part of KKR going ahead as he will be taking up a job as England cricket team coach. He informed us during a team meeting a few days ago.” England’s new director of men’s cricket, Rob Key, said last week that a job in the IPL would not stop a candidate from being appointed coach of the Test team, but McCullum has nevertheless decided to concentrate on his role with the ECB. “It’s not an issue if they’re the best person,” Key said. “You have to move with the times and I can’t see why Jos Buttler, for instance, could play the whole IPL but our coaches couldn’t be there for it all. Who knows where the IPL will be in five years’ time but at the moment there’s no international cricket when the IPL’s on. I’d rather have the best person for 10 months a year than someone not as good for 12.” McCullum guided KKR to last year’s IPL final, albeit after a stunning and unexpected turnaround with the team having lost five of their first seven games, but this season they sit seventh in the table and only the bottom-placed Mumbai Indians have lost more matches. While McCullum’s appointment could be confirmed as early as Thursday the process of recruiting a white-ball coach continues, and the interview process is still incomplete. Matthew Mott, the 48-year-old head coach of Australia’s women’s white-ball team, has emerged as a leading contender for the equivalent job with England’s men, for which his chief rival is thought to be Paul Collingwood, England’s interim head coach for the five-match T20 series in Barbados in January as well as their three-Test tour of West Indies in March.",Sport/Sport,Brendon McCullum set to be appointed England men’s Test coach,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/11/brendon-mccullum-set-to-be-appointed-england-mens-test-coach
5/12/2022,"There is a moment in the second season of the Netflix series Narcos when the baddest baddie of them all, Pablo Escobar, is reduced to burning dollar bills to keep warm. Boyd Holbrook, playing the DEA agent Steve Murphy, says: “I read in a book somewhere about a rich guy who goes broke. When he’s asked how it happened, how he had lost everything, he answered: ‘Slowly at first. And then … all at once.’” Ageing is a bit like that. You lose your vigour slowly at first, and then all at once. At 55 – it still shocks me when I write that number down – I am not yet at what I might term the money-burning phase of my decline, but three unsettling indicators of the downward slope of life have come my way in the past week. They are not serious in and of themselves, but together they’re nagging away at me like nobody’s business. I’ve got a book coming out later in the year. The team at the publisher tasked with promoting it were running me through various interview opportunities. Towards the end of the list, the flow of the meeting faltered and one or two of them looked a mite embarrassed. “Would you, er, consider doing an, um, interview with …” someone started to ask. What could this be, I wondered. Lynn Barber coming out of retirement to flay me alive? No, nothing like that. “Would you mind,” they continued, “doing something with …” Pause. “Saga magazine?” There, they’d got it out. “Of course,” I said. I would never have thought to take any offence but their trepidation made me think again. Then my younger daughter, who is away at university, started doing something odd. Hitherto, whenever I’ve called her, she has answered with something like: “What?” or, more likely, a text telling me why she can’t speak at that moment. Now, out of the blue, she has taken to answering with: “Hi. Everything OK?” What? Me? OK? Why do you ask? You’ve never asked before! All very concerning. And then, the clincher. I was talking to an old friend in Yorkshire about a Leeds United match he was travelling down to London for. He sounded weary. It wasn’t the prospect of the punishing journey tiring him out, so much as the evening kick-off. “It’s just all so late,” he said. “I mean, by the end of half-time it’s nine o’clock. If I was at home, that’s about when I’d have a bit of a yawn and stretch and say to my wife: ‘Do you know what? I think I’m going to go up.’ And then I’ll read in bed for half an hour and that’ll be me. Sound asleep. And there I’ll be at Crystal Palace, miles from home on a school night, tired out and stressed out all at the same time.” I have known this chap since the last century, when we were at college together. We bonded over football, travelling all over the country together watching our respective teams. And now he’s fading away at half-time. I was appalled, not to say disgusted. Especially when I realised that I felt the same way. The next evening match I attended, come half-time I was yawning like the gaps in my team’s defence. I considered a coffee to help get me through the second half. I blame my friend for putting these thoughts in my head; I might not have noticed them otherwise. I despair. What has become of us since the very thought of floodlit football had our pulses racing for days on end? Now we can barely make the final whistle. When you’re tired at half-time, you’re tired of life. The end is nigh. Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,How do I know I’m getting old?

5/12/2022,"One in five letters and parcels sent first class do not arrive the next working day, Royal Mail has admitted. Just weeks after it increased its postage prices, when the cost of a first-class stamp went up 10p to 95p, the company said its services had been hit by the continued impact of Covid and higher staff absences. Royal Mail said just under 82% of first-class mail was delivered the next working day in the 12 months to the start of April. This was an improvement on the level of almost 75% a year earlier, but still below its key target of 93%. Its second-class deliveries fared better, according to its annual service statistics, and 95% of these items arrived as expected within three working days. But this was still below the company’s target of a minimum of 98.5% second-class items delivered within this timeframe. Royal Mail said the quality of its service during the year to April was “materially impacted by the exceptional ongoing effects of the pandemic resulting in increased Covid-related absence and self-isolation and social distancing in line with government guidance”. The London-listed company is required to deliver to 31m homes and business across the UK six days a week for the same price, regardless of the distance travelled, under its universal service obligation. It said far more parcels and far fewer letters were sent during the pandemic, which made it “very challenging” to meet its usual service standards. Absences among Royal Mail staff hit a peak in January, when more than 15,000 employees were off sick or were self-isolating, as the Omicron variant spread across the country. The company said it recruited temporary additional staff and set up a special delivery task forces to provide support to the offices that were most affected by staffing shortages. There have been improvements to its service in recent weeks, the company said, with more than 86% of first-class mail arriving the next working day, and more than 97% of second-class items within three working days. Royal Mail has previously blamed a long-term decline in letter usage and rising costs for its most recent inflation-busting postage price increases, which came into effect in early April. The company has also been facing growing complaints from customers, which soared to more than 1m in the year to March 2021, the highest level for a decade.",News/Business,Royal Mail admits a fifth of first class parcels do not arrive next working day,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/one-in-five-first-class-letters-and-parcels-fails-to-arrive-next-working-day-royal-mail-covid-staff-absences
5/12/2022,"Leonid Kravchuk, who has died after a long illness aged 88, was a Communist party bureaucrat who became the first president of independent Ukraine and a main player in bringing the Soviet Union to an ignominious end. At a hastily arranged meeting in a remote hunting lodge in the Belavezha forest in Belarus in December 1991, Kravchuk joined Stanislav Shushkevich, a nuclear physicist who was the leader of Belarus, and Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, in signing a declaration that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Shushkevich died of Covid-19 a week ago. Yeltsin died in 2007. Kravchuk was the most dynamic and radical of the three men during the fateful discussion. Fearing Russia would continue to try to dominate Ukraine, he told Yeltsin he did not want the Soviet Union to turn itself into a loose confederation. It should be abolished altogether. The three men’s deal had gone ahead without the knowledge of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, who was shocked when he heard the news. He had no choice but to resign two weeks later, after accepting that the three Slavic republics, the core entities of the Soviet Union, were no longer loyal to the system. The road to independence had begun in August 1991 when the Ukrainian parliament voted for secession from the Soviet Union a few days after the collapse of an abortive coup by communist hardliners in Moscow to reverse Gorbachev’s democratisation programme. Kravchuk led the Communist party majority in parliament and played a key role in persuading his colleagues to support the opposition’s proposal for independence. The parliament arranged a confirmatory referendum and a presidential election for 1 December. Some 92% of the Ukrainian electorate, including a majority of Ukraine’s ethnic Russians, voted for independence. Kravchuk was chosen as president, a job in which he served until 1994. In 1992, at a meeting with the US president George HW Bush, Kravchuk agreed to send back to Russia the nuclear missiles that were deployed in Ukraine. Sometimes touted as a magnanimous gesture, Kravchuk told German radio that Kyiv’s possession of a nuclear arsenal was mainly symbolic. “All the control systems were in Russia. The black suitcase with the start button, that was with the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin,” he said. Kravchuk was born into a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Velykyi Zhytyn. The village was in Poland at the time, and Kravchuk’s parents worked for Polish landowners. It was taken into the Soviet Union after the Soviet invasion in 1939. Kravchuk’s father had served in the Polish army in the 1930s and was killed during the second world war. Kravchuk graduated from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv in 1958, a year after marrying a mathematics teacher, Antonina Mykhailivna Mishura. He immediately joined the Communist party and worked his way up through the agitprop department. By 1989 he was ideological secretary of the central committee in Kyiv. His first sense of the strength of feeling for independence came when he discreetly attended the founding congress of Ruch, a popular grassroots national movement, sitting in the back row of the gallery as an observer in 1989. In 1990 the Communist party elected him as chairman of the supreme soviet of the Ukrainian parliament, making him the nominal head of state. His low-key style and openness to alternative views made him the compromise candidate, supported by conservatives as well as reformers. His term as president was marked by his even-handed approach to foreign policy. He took a pro-European stance, even as he championed Russian speakers and sought to guarantee them better language rights. He spoke in favour of an agreement giving Russia the right to continue to base its Black Sea fleet at Sevastopol in the Crimea. In 1994 he signed a partnership agreement with the EU, but later that year he lost the election to Leonid Kuchma, his prime minister, who argued that the reduction of economic links with Russia had caused Ukraine’s lack of growth. From then on Kravchuk remained an MP but floated rather aimlessly, switching for a time to a group led by a pro-Russian oligarch, Viktor Medvedchuk, which called itself the Social Democratic party of Ukraine. In the 2004 presidential election, which was marred by fraud and had to be re-run, Kravchuk supported the pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych against the pro-western Viktor Yushchenko, who won. In 2006 he failed to be re-elected to parliament. He then went into political obscurity, appearing only for occasional interviews. In 2014 he denounced Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea, telling Radio Free Europe that the Russian president’s philosophy of a broad “Russian world” was centred on “aggression and disregard for the interests of its neighbours”. In 2020, at the age of 86, he accepted an invitation from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to take the post of presidential envoy in the trilateral contact group on resolving the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. The group consisted of Russia, Ukraine and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, but it failed to make progress. Kravchuk is survived by his wife and their son, Oleksandr.

5/12/2022,"Anthony Albanese has been declared the winner of the final leaders’ debate of the election campaign after he and Scott Morrison put forward competing views on wage rises, economic management and energy policy. With less than a fortnight until polling day, about 150 undecided voters determined Albanese the clear winner of the Channel Seven debate on Wednesday night. The Labor leader convinced 50% of those who voted in the network’s “pub test” compared to 34% for Morrison and 16% who were still undecided. In a tightly managed discussion, the debate initially focused on the issue of wage increases that had dominated the campaign trail on Wednesday. Pressed on his remarks supporting pay rises for those on the minimum wage, Albanese said that the Fair Work Commission was independent of government but he would welcome a decision that saw wage increases match inflation. “What we have said throughout this campaign is that we don’t want people to be left behind,” Albanese said. “If the increase is less than the inflation rate then what that means is they will be getting a real wage cut – and they deserve better than that.” The Labor leader rejected suggestions a 5% pay increase would damage the economy, saying it was the equivalent of the cost of two cups of coffee a day. “We need to look after people who are vulnerable. We need to do more than say ‘Thanks very much for everything you did in the pandemic but now we are going to cut your wages’.” When asked how much of a pay rise low-income earners deserved, Morrison said the Fair Work Commission was “the right place to do that”. “The economy needs stability and it needs certainty, particularly with the many things that are pressuring down on the economy today,” he said. “I’d welcome pay rises obviously for all workers, not just those on the minimum wages, but we need to have an economy that’s strong into the future and if you have wages that rise at 5.1%, which is exactly what Mr Albanese said yesterday, that means that can feed into inflation which pushes up interest rates and pushes up the cost of living even more.” The prime minister argued small business owners would not be able to afford a 5% pay increase and jobs would be lost. “People won’t be worrying about what their wages are, they will be worrying about whether they have a job,” Morrison said. The two leaders were asked what they would do to keep a lid on interest rates and to ease the cost-of-living pressures facing families. Morrison said the government had kept “downward pressure” on interest rates through good economic management, while Albanese spoke about the AAA credit rating achieved when federal Labor was last in power. The moderator, Channel Seven’s political editor Mark Riley, told Morrison he was “smashing out the talking points” after he listed budget measures aimed at easing cost-of-living pressures, including fuel tax relief and previously legislated income tax cuts. When asked about energy policy – and to guarantee that they would not introduce a mining or carbon tax – Morrison stood by his description of the safeguard mechanism as a “sneaky carbon tax”, saying Albanese intended to lower the threshold that would add prices to mineral, oil, gas and cement production. The safeguard mechanism was introduced by the Coalition in 2014 but has failed to cut industrial emissions as it was initially intended – something Labor is promising to fix. Albanese ruled out introducing a carbon or mining tax and sought to pivot to the commonwealth’s support of Clive Palmer in a court case that challenged WA’s pandemic border closures. “Scott Morrison – when he had a choice between Mark McGowan and Clive Palmer – he chose Clive Palmer,” Albanese said. “He went to court as part of that, with the solicitor general, he spent taxpayers’ money backing up Clive Palmer’s legal case to open up WA’s borders.” The two leaders acknowledged there was “disillusionment” in the community that had led to a rising number of people leaning towards independents, with Albanese using the question to advocate for a national integrity commission. “We need to restore faith in politics,” he said. Asked for his explanation for the trend, Morrison said the past few years had been “incredibly tough” throughout the pandemic which had “greatly disrupted” both society and community, but said this was not a time to risk change. “A vote for the independents may be well-meaning, but it would be a vote to weaken parliament and weaken Australia,” Morrison said. Morrison faced sustained questions from Riley about a $500,000 payout made to Alan Tudge’s former media adviser Rachelle Miller, with whom Tudge had a relationship, asking why taxpayers could not know further details. The prime minister said that the payment had not yet been settled and defended his handling of the issue, saying he had held an independent inquiry and acted “swiftly”. “People who have relationships in the office that’s something I’ve never approved of,” the prime minister said, reiterating that Tudge would return as education minister in his cabinet if the Coalition won the 21 May election. Albanese said transparency was needed and it was “extraordinary” that there was doubt in the election campaign about who was the education minister. In the final question of the night, the two leaders were asked to nominate something they respected about the other. “The thing about Anthony I’ve always admired – he has never forgotten where he has come from. He grew up in housing commission … and he has shown the ability to rise to be the leader of one of the oldest parties in this country,” Morrison said. Albanese acknowledged the job of prime minister was “obviously a difficult one to do” and said he admired Morrison’s commitment to the country. “And on a range of issues, to name one, mental health in terms of young people. We have seen increased funding for mental health,” the Labor leader said.",News/Australia news,"Albanese wins final election debate over Morrison, according to Seven’s undecided voters",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/albanese-wins-final-election-debate-over-morrison-according-to-sevens-undecided-voters
5/12/2022,"Agigantic green ball is on the loose, being herded around by a gang of schoolchildren, who gleefully speed it towards a circle of squishy foam animals, crashing into a projector hanging from the ceiling along the way. Other kids leap between the vinyl-covered creatures, hopping from turtle to tiger, while one boy begins rodeo-riding a seal. In the room next door, another class hurtles themselves down a series of glossy red slides that radiate from a stepped podium, while others are busy with scraps of gold leaf, taking turns to jump up and stick their sparkling fingerprints on the walls of the Nottingham Contemporary. This is exactly the kind of merry mayhem that the modernist architect Lina Bo Bardi imagined when she drew an illustration of the public piazza of her Museum of Art in São Paulo (Masp) in 1968. At the height of Brazil’s repressive military dictatorship, she pictured a world of innocent play, where children clambered over rainbow carousels, crawled through tubes and slid down the red ribbon-like slides of her “practicable sculptures” – which never saw the light of day. “She depicted an impossible reality,” says Jane Hall, a member of the Turner prize-winning architecture collective Assemble, who have been commissioned by the Nottingham gallery to bring some of Bo Bardi’s playful schemes to life more than half a century after she drew them. “You could never have had children occupying public space in this way under the dictatorship, but she wanted them to be the lifeblood of the institution.” As Bo Bardi implored: “The young will be the protagonists in the life of the museum through design, music and theatre.” The Nottingham show takes her evocative drawing as the starting point for the installations, which see two of her playful sculptures created for the first time, along with a third that was developed in collaboration with local schoolchildren. A vitrine at the entrance to the gallery presents a gloopy clay tableau of amorphous bits and bobs produced with the schoolkids, which was then “interpreted” by Assemble (with a good deal of artistic licence) into the play structure. The result is an enigmatic thing, a green wooden latticework cocoon upholstered with squidgy blue cushions, which emit recordings of playground noises when you press them, all surmounted by the momentous inflatable green ball, crowning the structure like a big shiny pea. “We never imagined they would climb up it,” says one invigilator, looking on slightly aghast as a group of children scale the wooden structure and take turns to launch themselves on top of the inflatable ball, trying as hard as they can to pop it. “We hadn’t predicted that they would use the animals as trampolines either.” Adults can never predict what children will do, which is what makes this show a surreal delight (and a possible headache for those running the space). Unlike the usual prescriptive playground equipment designed by grownups, the things in these galleries are intended to be triggers for an unforeseen universe of imaginative play, directed by the children themselves with anarchic joy. It might not be as elaborately equipped as the soft play centre up the road, but it’s free – and it comes with the added frisson of being allowed to charge around like this in the hallowed surrounds of a contemporary art gallery. The process has been a boon for the local schools, too, injecting some freeform mischief into the curriculum. “Schools can sometimes build a system that saps the imagination out of children,” says Ross Brooks, interim headteacher at the Jubilee Academy in Bilbrough, one of the schools involved. “The art curriculum can often be quite standardised, but this project has really opened our pupils’ eyes to a different world. I’ve noticed them mixing with others who they might not normally play with in the playground, and really working cooperatively together.” As part of Nottingham Contemporary’s Schools of Tomorrow programme, artists have been resident in seven primary schools and one nursery for the last three years, conducting activities that also feature in the exhibition. The precarious projector shows footage from a GoPro camera that was strapped to toddlers’ heads – play through the eyes of the children. Another wall spells out a series of rules for play, intended to be edited and added to with sticky notes by visitors during the length of the exhibition. Another shows a typeface developed by pupils, which has been used to scrawl further prompts for play on the walls around the gallery. “Just stop then start,” says one slogan. “Forget time,” says another. The children evidently had a great time in these workshops and, from the schools’ perspective, the impact is clear. “It might be quite common to be the first generation of the family to go to university,” one teacher tells me. “But for some of our kids they’re the first member of their family to ever go to a gallery. This exhibition is literally opening doors.” As social outreach, the programme has brought benefits, but the workshops don’t particularly translate into much that is meaningful on the gallery walls. Instead the work feels a bit like vignettes from the institution’s annual report, dutifully recording the outputs of the learning team. The use of Lina Bo Bardi also feels a bit thin. In recent years, she has become a fashionable figure to be cited by socially minded artists and architects alike, keen to align their work with her inclusive, user-driven approach to the design of buildings and public spaces. Having been less celebrated than her male counterparts for much of the 20th century, she has posthumously enjoyed a spate of exhibitions over the past decade, one of which Assemble also designed. Perhaps because of this, the Nottingham show seems to assume its visitors will be familiar with her work, and limits her presence to a single screen showing a few images and quotes. Why her, visitors might wonder. Why this particular drawing? Why now?Still, such questions seem to bother the kids little as they hurtle around the rooms, bouncing between the play structures in euphoric disbelief that an art gallery could ever be so much fun. You can almost hear the ghost of Bo Bardi chortling as the whoops of delight echo through the building.

5/12/2022,"Everyone is talking about the misogynistic culture of politics. And when I am asked, as a youngish woman in local politics, whether I have experienced any, I hesitate – “How long have you got?” I wonder. Because, yes, in my relatively few years as a lowly councillor and parliamentary candidate, I have experienced 50 shades of bullying, gaslighting, undermining, sexist remarks, sexual harassment, sexual advances, demeaning comments, manipulation and outright discrimination. Overall, this has not overshadowed the positive and worthwhile work of political representation, but it has hovered in the distance like a grey cloud, occasionally raining on my parade and dampening my spirits. There have been two standout episodes that might give a glimpse into this murky world and are probably symptomatic of the wider issues. The first involved repeated unwanted physical sexual advances from a senior colleague who did not understand the concept of consent. It made me feel uncomfortable, and I worried that he might do the same to other younger and less confident women, so I reported it locally. The response? I was told to not make a fuss. I was specifically told it would not help my political career if I made a big deal out of it. I was depressed by how many (sometimes well-meaning) people advised me to let it go. But I didn’t. With the support of a courageous female colleague who had also been sexually harassed by the same man, we found others. We collected statements from other women and made a formal complaint as a group. You cannot imagine the unholy hell this unleashed. I was subjected to a miserable year of abuse, insults, exclusion and isolation, smears against me. I was called a liar, a tease, a snowflake, an alcoholic, a paedophile, a twisted political rival weaponising my sexuality … all the names under the sun. Without a doubt it cost me political support, opportunities, friendships, time, my health, lots of sleep and political capital within my networks. But ultimately after nearly 12 months, a barrister and a formal disciplinary process, the man was sanctioned, and we were vindicated. I felt cleansed. I also see a deep line in the sand around me that other men in my political circles recognise as a boundary not to be crossed. The second episode was institutional. As a new councillor I was prevented from speaking at a formal meeting by an experienced and senior chair from the dominant party. He didn’t just cut off my microphone; he interrupted me; he dismissed me; he belittled me; he shouted at me for more than an hour; he threatened to throw me out – anything to stop me from telling the truth to the public. Again, I made a formal complaint. Again, my colleagues advised me against it. “There’s no point,” they said. “That’s just the culture here.” “It won’t change.” “They will defend their own.” “They won’t even investigate your complaint.” And, of course, “It will not help your career.” “You will lose political capital and support.” “Just accept that is the nature of the beast and find a way to work around him.” But I did not accept it. My complaint was not investigated. Instead I was offered training. After all, I was the new girl who had no experience. There was no discipline; no apology. But in an off-the-record conversation I was told I would never have any difficulty in being allowed to speak at a similar meeting again after “what happened last time”. So the complaint did have an impact on behaviour. And each individual behaviour adds together to build up a culture. It seems to me that the long, tedious and unpopular task of raising official complaints about misogyny does help. It gradually erodes the unacceptable and builds up boundaries to be respected, a deterrent for those without conscience and clear legal precedents that serve as useful reminders of the sanctions for those who “don’t get it”. Of course women shouldn’t have to report abuse; and shouldn’t have to suffer abuse for reporting it. But this is the path, paved with uncomfortable objections, that could lead us out of the mire of misogyny. If the problem is a culture of accepted norms; then logically only challenging these norms, case by case, is ever going to gradually shift that culture. Because when a woman speaks up for herself, she does so for all women. The real question is: is anyone listening?
