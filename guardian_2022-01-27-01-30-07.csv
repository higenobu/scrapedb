1/27/2022,"Federal prosecutors have launched an investigation into the attempt by Republicans in seven presidential battleground states won by Joe Biden in 2020 to subvert the election result by sending bogus slates of Donald Trump electors to Congress. The ploy was one of the central tactics used by Trump loyalists as part of the “big lie” that he had defeated his Democratic challenger. The fake slates of electors were forwarded to congressional leaders, who then came under pressure to delay certification of Biden’s victory on 6 January 2021, the day of the Capitol insurrection.  In an interview on CNN, the deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, revealed that the justice department has begun an investigation into what she called the “fraudulent elector certifications”. She said the department had received referrals on the matter and “our prosecutors are looking at those”. Monaco added: “We are going to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead to address conduct of any kind and at any level that is part of an assault on our democracy.” Fake slates of Trump electors were sent to Congress from seven states in fact won by Biden – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Of those, two – New Mexico and Pennsylvania – added the caveat that the Trump electors should only be counted in the event of a disputed election. The other five states sent signed statements to Washington giving the appearance that Trump had won despite clear and verified counts placing Biden on top. Under America’s arcane presidential election system, US presidents are not chosen directly by voters but indirectly through electoral college votes meted out state by state. Official certificates naming the electors for the winning candidate in each state are then sent to Washington to be certified, in this case on 6 January, when hundreds of violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to disrupt the process. Earlier this month the pro-democracy group American Oversight obtained under freedom of information laws the bogus certificates from all seven states in which Republicans attempted to overturn the election result. The certificate from Georgia, one of the most hotly contested states in 2020, reads: “We, the undersigned, being the duly elected and qualified electors for president and vice president of the United States of America from the state of Georgia …” The fake statement then carries the names and signatures of 16 fake electors who claimed falsely to have cast their electoral college votes for Trump when in fact they had no legal standing to do so. The move was in direct contravention to the actual vote in Georgia, confirmed in multiple counts, which Biden won by 11,779 votes. Democratic attorneys general in at least two of the seven states – New Mexico and Michigan – have now asked federal prosecutors to examine whether drawing up the bogus certificates amounted to a crime. Their referrals appear to have triggered the DoJ’s investigation. The fact that Republicans left a paper trail by sending their phony certificates to both Congress and the National Archives suggest that they may now face legal peril. The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection has also recently begun to focus on the fake Trump electors, and particularly those who organized the plot. A figure of special interest is Rudy Giuliani, who acted as a lawyer for the Trump campaign and who has been reported to have spearheaded the fake elector strategy. The January 6 committee sent Giuliani a subpoena letter earlier this month specifically referring to his efforts instigating the ploy. Another area of intense interest is the draft letter prepared in December 2020 by Jeffrey Clark, a relatively lowly justice department official, who tried to persuade Georgia and six other states won by Biden to call back their electors from Congress and consider replacing them with Trump electors. The letter was never officially sent after the acting US attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, refused to play ball. The fake electors tactic was also central to the election subversion strategy laid out for Trump by the conservative lawyer John Eastman. In a now notorious two-page memo handed to Trump and the then vice-president, Mike Pence, in the Oval Office, Eastman argued that Pence could block the certification of Biden’s victory on 6 January. Pence had the constitutional role of presiding over the joint session of Congress that would certify the election results – a process usually considered purely ceremonial. But Eastman advised him that when he opened the electoral college ballot from Arizona he should announce that “he has multiple slates of electors, and so is going to defer decision on that”. By “multiple slates”, Eastman was referring to the official slate of electors returned by Arizona in favor of Biden who won the state by 10,457 votes and the fake slate of Trump electors that is now under federal investigation.",News/US news,US prosecutors investigate Republicans who sent fake Trump electors to Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/fake-trump-electors-us-investigation-doj
1/27/2022,"Ihad an unpleasant experience on Saturday afternoon, just a fleeting moment with a nasty aftertaste I can’t shake off. I had parked in a municipal pay-and-display car park in Smethwick near West Brom’s ground. I was trying to make sense of the rules, regulations, charges, methods of payment etc, when a woman of south Asian heritage puzzling over the same things asked me in a strong Black Country accent if I had any change. I said I was afraid I didn’t. I busied myself on my phone looking for the correct app with which to pay the correct amount for the correct parking location. As I was doing so, the woman approached me again with a question. She asked if you had to pay for the parking before you did your shopping, or afterwards. She had thought it was the latter, so had just bought a ticket that showed an exit time an hour away. I told her she had probably made a mistake. She said to me she was an idiot. I told her not to be hard on herself. She said I should use her ticket. I said I’d pay for it. She said there was no need. I insisted, then found a pound coin deep in my pocket, which was a mite embarrassing, given I’d just told her I didn’t have any change. She didn’t seem to make the connection. I gave her the pound and thanked her. She said she’d give me some change. I said there was no need, but she insisted. She gave me some change. We both laughed. I said that if all this went on much longer, I would miss kick-off. And off we went in the direction of the rest of our lives.So far, so perfectly nice. Then, as I set out for the ground, the window of a car came down to reveal an old, genial-looking white man wearing a West Brom scarf. In his Black Country accent, he said to me: “You want to be careful you don’t catch something from her; they’re not vaccinated around here, that lot.” There is so much that is casually horrible going on there that I don’t know where to start. The words “catch something” and “that lot” are probably key. And there’s also the distressing truth that, although he was apparently familiar with my work on radio and television, he had concluded I’d be open to such talk. Or perhaps I am overthinking this: maybe simply being the same colour as him was green light enough for this gentleman to share his thoughts with me. After all, the colour of this nice woman’s skin had been as much information about her as he felt he needed to help himself to whatever assumptions he fancied. All I felt I knew for sure about her was that paying for parking wasn’t her strongest suit.  I called an old friend of mine, a brilliant woman who works in community relations in the area. She sighed a sigh she’d sighed many a time before, by the sound of it. “None of that surprises me,” she said. “There’s stuff in the papers and it’s just more fuel on the fire for people who want to be divided. That’s not to say there isn’t a problem with vaccine takeup in some communities but none of this helps. The point is, he’s looked at her and decided what he’s decided and, worryingly, has felt able to voice it. It’s a nonsense. For all he knew, she was triple-vaccinated and working as a doctor or nurse or whatever.” So what did I do? Not much, I’m afraid. I was as shocked as my friend had been wearily unsurprised. When he recognised me and started to speak, I half-smiled, which I turned into a non-smile when I heard what he had to say. And I just walked away. I said nothing. I wish I’d had a quiet word.

1/27/2022,"Coronavirus has stopped us in our tracks and forced us to rethink our position as the rulers of the world. You could say it has done us a favour. An invisible enemy has challenged our treatment of the non-human world and the planet we share. For about 2,000 years most humans have imagined themselves to be the Earth’s “apex predators” – smarter, faster and more deadly than any other creature with which we share the planet. An article in a 2018 special issue of Scientific American praised our species for “the richness of our subjective experience” and “better cognitive skills and bigger brains” – although elephants have bigger brains and no one has worked out how to measure the “subjective experience” of non-human animals.  Our species has not always been so conceited. If we go back 200,000 years, we would find the earliest Homo sapiens acting more like rabbits than lions – shivering at the sound of rustling in the tall grass and huddling at the sight of a pack of hyenas. How much of our existence as a species was spent battling and dodging more dangerous animals we do not know, but the (usually) men who conquered the marauding beasts were often memorialised in myth. Humans did not rise from their beleaguered status to anything resembling global dominance in a single leap. For many centuries, “civilised” or urban states embraced religions in which humans and non-human animals appeared to be more or less equals. At least in myth, they could speak to and understand each other, mate and quarrel with each other and, most clearly in the case of the Roman and Greek gods, behave like the lead stars in a reality show. Only with the arrival of monotheism, roughly between 1200BC and AD700, did the unique gods of each polity acquire names and something like personalities – Jaweh, Jesus and Allah. As these monotheistic super-gods grew and incorporated the attributes once spread among the many gods of polytheistic religions, they became more abstract and removed from the material world – to the point where that material world began to seem inferior and even disgusting, as illustrated by a bishop who educated his congregation by pulling out every feather, one by one, from a sparrow to punish it for being a “devil”, ie a non-human, a bird. Hinduism was far more tolerant, making no spiritual distinction between human beings and other life forms. The Covid pandemic presents us with a particularly sharp difference between two of the species populating Earth: on the one hand, the complexity of the human species, with its overgrown brain and its mobile limbs; and on the other hand, the simplicity of a microbe or sub-microbial particle such as a virus, which has evolved to prey on creatures larger than itself. In the late 19th century, humans, who had fought megafauna as predators and prey and had gone on to fight each other, confronted for the first time the invisible enemies that frequently attacked them and their children. Leading European scientists, notably Louis Pasteur, proved that diseases could be spread from one vessel to another, while the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck identified infectious agents he called viruses. Over the course of millennia, a pyramid of antagonistic creatures had arisen on our planet, ranging in size from viruses to bacteria to the cells that comprise whole living bodies. Humans have learned to make use of some of these tiny beings, for example in food production and medicine, but now we find ourselves in a less powerful position. We must, belatedly, come to an accommodation. This will involve rethinking the idea of our supremacy. There is hope for a more equitable arrangement between the Earth’s species. In 2012, an international conference in Cambridge, Consciousness in Human and Non-Human Animals, issued a “formal acknowledgment that many non-human animals, including mammals, birds and cephalopods, also possess ‘the neurological substrates that generate consciousness’”. This was, in its own way, a thunderous shift in human consciousness, which had so far given no quarter to the idea that non-human animals are capable of imagination, curiosity and other human-like traits. It raised a multitude of questions about humanity’s position in the world. What did the conference-goers mean by “consciousness”? And why were scientists only now discovering animal consciousness, after generations of putting animals to work in their laboratories as sources of tissues and cells? What are the ethics of using animals, and who should decide? Perhaps the philosophical questions are the easiest to answer, and they are not easy at all. The practical questions are harder. Can we share the Earth with our fellow earthlings? What happens to the non-human animals incarcerated in feedlots and abattoirs? How will humans subsist if large chunks of the planet are “rewilded” for optimal animal life? We may be on the verge of making peace with our planet-mates, we may finally see the moral as well as practical reasons for doing so, but can we work out how? The burden of initiating “peace talks” between humans and non-humans no doubt lies with us. It is our kind that emptied the once crowded rivers and plains, who silenced the chatter of the forests and ploughed the grassy fields. We have a lot to learn from each other – assuming of course that the non-humans among us are still willing to make contact with creatures as bloody-minded as we have proved to be. And the first thing we humans will have to learn – the foundation of everything else – is humility.

1/27/2022,"This assiduous survey of the life and career of the actor Boris Karloff gracefully acknowledges that he will always be welded in the public imagination to his role as the monster in the classic 1931 adaptation of Frankenstein. However, this documentary has a lot more to say about his long and quite fascinating acting career, which he began in the silent era as a handsome action man (“a French-Canadian trapper type,” the voiceover calls him, like that’s a thing) and saw him become a considerable box-office draw for the many horror films he made in the 1930s and 40s. By the end, he was a sweetly self-spoofing TV host and icon happy to do cameo roles in cheerful horror schlock despite his increasing physical frailty, and made an indelible impression on many generations with his deep, velvety voice as the title character of the 1966 animated version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. In addition to offering a solid biographical survey that traces Karloff, born William Henry Pratt, back to his troubled childhood as the son of Anglo-Indian parents, director Thomas Hamilton has assembled an impressive roster of interviewees with smart, perceptive things to say about Karloff’s work and the context of the times. The canniest comments come from film directors who either worked with him (including the very recently deceased Peter Bogdanovich, who directed him in one of his last films, Targets, in 1968) or deeply understand the nature of horror films, such as Guillermo del Toro, Joe Dante, and John Landis. In addition, Karloff’s daughter Sara remembers her father fondly, and a deep bench of film scholars (illustrious silent film expert Kevin Brownlow, walking film encyclopaedia Leonard Maltin) are on hand to dispense acute observations and trivia.  Altogether this is one huge knowledge bomb, and given the depth of research and rich store of archive material, it’s a shame that the original parts of the documentary are so shonky – too many green screens, for example, behind interviewees for no discernible gain. Visually, it feels very much like a cable-channel schedule filler, or a DVD box-set extra, which is possibly exactly what it was meant to be.

1/27/2022,"Emmanuel Macron is to meet representatives of the Pieds Noirs – the Algerian-born French citizens who fled to France after Algerian independence in 1962 – as he seeks to address France’s colonial legacy in north Africa ahead of a bid for re-election this spring. The Elysée said the aim was to continue Macron’s drive to build a “calm, shared memory, common to all” of the Algerian conflict.  Macron, the first French president born after the Algerian war of independence of 1954-62, has sought during his five years in office to make steps towards recognising the brutality of the Algeria conflict, which has been shrouded in secrecy in denials and remains a divisive factor in modern French society. His latest move to address France’s past in Algeria, which it occupied from 1830 to 1962, comes before the 60th anniversary of Algerian independence this year, just as far-right candidates in the spring French presidential election continue to focus on issues of immigration, Islam and divisions in society. Macron will host a meeting with representatives from French and European families who lived in Algeria during French rule and returned to France after Algeria was granted independence, who were known as Pieds Noirs. His office said he would move towards the “recognition” of civilian deaths in a shooting that happened at rue d’Isly in Algiers on March 1962, one week after the signing of the Evian peace accords and the ceasefire which ended the war. On rue d’Islay, supporters of French Algeria who had tried to push towards the Bab El-Oued neighbourhood of Algiers were shot at by a unit of the French army, causing at least 50 deaths. It marked the start of a mass exodus of the so-called Pieds Noirs from Algeria to France, many settling in southern France. Macron had sparked controversy, including criticism from some Pieds Noirs groups, during the last presidential campaign in 2017 when he declared that France’s colonisation of Algeria was a “crime against humanity”. He later backtracked on his comments, calling for “neither denial nor repentance” over France’s colonial history and adding: “We cannot remain trapped in the past.” Since then, he is seen as going further than previous French presidents in beginning to officially recognise the brutality of the Algeria conflict, although rights groups and historians have said Paris has further to go in reconciling France with its colonial past. In 2018, Macron acknowledged that the French military instituted a “system” that facilitated torture as it sought to cling on to its 130-year rule in the country – a landmark admission by France. He used the case of the mathematician Maurice Audin, a Communist pro-independence activist who disappeared in 1957, to make a far-reaching comment about France’s sanctioning of torture, going further than any previous president. Last year, Macron admitted that French soldiers tortured and killed Algerian lawyer and activist Ali Boumendjel, in 1957 during the country’s independence war. The death had been recorded as suicide. “No crime, no atrocity committed by anyone during the Algerian war can be excused or remain secret,” the president’s office said at the time. Last year, Macron asked forgiveness for the failures of France towards the Algerians known as “harkis”, a loaded and often pejorative term for the Algerian Muslims who helped the French in the brutal eight-year independence war and faced discrimination and poverty in France. Macron also said in a statement last autumn that a bloody police operation against Algerian protesters in Paris on 17 October 1961, which led to dozens of deaths which have never been legally investigated and saw protesters beaten and thrown into the Seine, amounted to “crimes” that were “inexcusable” for France. But he was accused by historians and rights groups for stopping short of an official state apology.",News/World news,Macron meets Algerian-born French citizens with one eye on election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/emmanuel-macron-to-meet-algerian-born-french-citizens
1/27/2022,"This current transfer window hasn’t been particularly interesting, has it?

From the get-go this January, they pimped their shopping trolley real good, priming it for a supermarket sweep of talent, with square wheels that squeak when they turn, a horn that blasts glitter when you honk it, the works.

1/27/2022,"It’s been long enough since 2016’s Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End came out that I kind of miss Nathan Drake, the breezy, globetrotting, treasure-hunting star of the Uncharted series. In contrast to developer Naughty Dog’s other PlayStation series The Last of Us, a rather harrowing post-apocalyptic meditation on human darkness, Uncharted is a straightforwardly fun and light-hearted action-movie story. You never have to think too hard about what you’re doing or why, and as long as you can surrender your will to the game – for there is little room for improvisation in these climbing puzzles, shootouts and well-acted story scenes – you’ll have a good time.  Back then I was ready to see the back of Nathan Drake. His quips had started to feel predictable, the Indiana Jones setpieces of his global adventures – collapsing ledges, trap-filled tombs, cursed treasure – even more so. This game is a farewell to him, wringing a surprising amount of pathos from the cast and their relationships to each other (particularly Nathan and his wife, Elena, who share an adorable scene in front of a PlayStation in their front room in the opening hours that still hits just as well now). This series had run out of road, with no further far-flung corners of the world or secret character backstories to explore, and in retrospect it is easier to appreciate this as a victory tour for a developer that really mastered the blockbuster cinematic action game. Then there’s 2017’s Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, also a part of this re-release package, a spin-off starring two of the series’ female characters that really became its own thing: a kind of high-octane buddy movie carried brilliantly by its stars Chloe (Claudia Black) and Nadine (Laura Bailey). The action might be largely the same, but it showed what new stars can bring to a series as character-driven as this. The premise is still a twisty-turny treasure hunt, but the action is exhilarating and the whole thing is over in six to eight or so hours; a snappier playtime that actually serves the story better. Playing it again, I actually wanted more. The improvements that this rerelease brings to the two games feel minor. You can feel the impact of gunshots and cliff-grabs through the PS5’s superlative controller rumble; I played around with the framerate and resolution, switching between different performance modes on a giant TV, and though the difference was noticeable, it was not transformational. They always were gorgeous games. Given that Uncharted 4 is already available on PlayStation 5 as part of a wee free collection of PlayStation classics for all PlayStation Plus subscribers, it’s hard to argue that this is an essential purchase for anyone who’s played these games before. If they passed you by at the time, though, this is the best way to experience two different spins on the same bombastic action game – adventures that remind us why characters such as Nathan Drake (and his spiritual predecessor Lara Croft) suit video games so well.

1/27/2022,"Late-night hosts assessed a hot mic moment for Joe Biden on Monday, in which the president insulted a Fox News reporter. At the tail end of a press conference, Fox News’s White House correspondent, Peter Doocy, asked whether Biden viewed inflation as a potential political liability ahead of the midterms this year. His rostrum microphone still on, Biden was heard responding, sarcastically, “that’s a great asset. More inflation. What a stupid son of a bitch.”  Whoever said ""there's no such thing as a stupid question,"" clearly never had to answer a question from Fox News. pic.twitter.com/LR3kISUuNx “This is what happens when you’ve been on Zoom calls for two years,” said Trevor Noah on Tuesday’s Daily Show. “You forget that real life doesn’t have a mute button. “Now a lot of people are asking if Biden even knew that the microphone was on, but guys please, come on. He’s sitting there talking into a giant microphone, so there’s at least a 50-50 chance he knew it was there.” As for people online dunking on Doocy for asking a stupid question – “they’re right,” said Noah. “‘Do you think inflation is a political liability?’ is a very stupid question. I mean, what’s Biden supposed to say? ‘No, I think people like spending more money to buy the same shit!’ “I mean, if you get to ask the president a question, you should ask him real questions, like ‘why can’t the CDC get its messaging straight on Covid?’ Or ‘can you ask your dog to stop chewing my arm?’” Noah also addressed people who have used the moment to compare Biden’s contempt for Doocy to Donald Trump’s well-established animosity toward the press. “I’m sorry, guys, no. I can’t accept that. I cannot believe that someone would even say something so disrespectful about my man Donald Jiujitsu Trump,” he joked. “Biden dropped one off-handed diss on a reporter, he’s no legend. Attacking the press was Donald Trump’s thing. Shit, you can’t compare these two, it’s like comparing Steph Curry to a random guy who makes one half-court shot during halftime. Show some respect!” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also commented on Biden’s frustration with Doocy. “The media has described this moment as a ‘hot mic’, but I’m not sure how it’s a hot mic when he’s at a press conference in front of a bunch of reporters talking into the same microphone he’s been using the entire time. “That’s like a celebrity walking the red carpet, poppin’ open their shirt and going, ‘Oops! Nip slip.’ “It’s never appropriate for the president of the United States to have a potty mouth, but it’s especially egregious to call Peter Doocy a son of a bitch,” Colbert joked, as Doocy is the son of the Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy. “So if anything, he’s a son of a Dooce. A real Dooce-bag, if you will. “On the other hand, he has tested positive for stupid in the past,” he added, pointing to a 2017 clip in which Senator John McCain responded to one of Doocy’s questions with: “Why would you ask something that stupid? Why would you ask something that dumb?” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel checked in on “the unfortunate punching bag when it comes to Covid”, AKA the White House infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci. Last week, the New York Post, “looking for anything that they can sink their teeth into”, posted several tweets calling the White House infectious disease expert a “narcissist.” “This is what they do when they want to say something but they don’t want to say it – they post tweets that say it,” Kimmel said. As evidence, the paper cited a photo of Fauci’s home office, which includes a self-portrait and bobblehead of himself. “If having a bunch of pictures and bobbleheads of yourself makes you a narcissist, then buckle up, New York Post, because you are not going to like what we found out about this guy,” Kimmel said, pointing to a picture of Donald Trump’s Donald Trump-adorned office. In other disappointing news for the former president, Kimmel pointed to a new analysis of social media impressions by Axios, which found that the most talked about politician online was the Texas senator Ted Cruz, followed by congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rashida Tlaib. Trump was seventh on the list, behind Nancy Pelosi. “Wow, good thing Trump doesn’t care about polls and publicity and ratings and stuff like that,” Kimmel joked. “He’s six spots behind Ted Cruz.

1/27/2022,"Police said the family of a five-year-old boy who was killed in Coventry are “devastated”, as a 49-year-old woman who was known to them was arrested on suspicion of murder. Police were called to the Earlsdon area of the city just after 5pm on Tuesday where the boy, who was just short of his sixth birthday, was found with “significant injuries”.  Officers confirmed that the woman they had arrested was known to the family. Supt Ronan Tyrer, from West Midlands police, said that despite extensive efforts from police officers and paramedics, “unfortunately nothing could be done to save him”. “The boy’s parents are being supported by family liaison officers during this heartbreaking time,” he said. He added that officers were called to a local Co-op shop as part of the incident. Police said the 49-year-old woman remained in custody, and that they were not looking for anyone else. Tyrer asked the public to show consideration for the family of the boy, who were “clearly devastated”, and asked people to “consider the impact images shared on social media can have” and not to share posts containing speculation about the death. The incident took place on Poplar Road in Coventry, which runs parallel to the street where an armed man barricaded himself in his home with his eight-year-old son earlier this month. “This is the second incident is as many weeks, unfortunately,” Tyrer said. “The two incidents are completely unrelated, and a significant police presence will remain in the area.”",News/UK news,"Coventry police continue to hold woman, 49, after death of five-year-old ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/26/woman-arrested-over-death-of-five-year-old-boy-in-coventry
1/27/2022,"Official modelling efforts have been subjected to barrages of criticism throughout the pandemic, from across the political spectrum. No doubt some of that criticism has appeared justified – the result of highly publicised projections that never came to pass. In July 2021, for instance, the newly installed health secretary, Sajid Javid, warned that cases could soon rise above 100,000 a day. His figure was based on modelling from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, known as SPI-M. One influential SPI-M member, Prof Neil Ferguson, went further and suggested that, following the “freedom day” relaxation of restrictions on 19 July, the 100,000 figure was “almost inevitable” and that 200,000 cases a day was possible. Cases topped out at an average of about 50,000 a day just before “freedom day”, before falling and plateauing between 25,000 and 45,000 for the next four months.  It is incredibly easy to criticise a projection that didn’t come true. It’s harder, however, to find out which were the assumptions that made the projection wrong. And, of course, it’s harder still to do that before the projection has been shown to be incorrect. But that is what we ask our modellers to do, and we are quick to complain when their projections do not match reality. Much of the criticism they have received, however, has been misplaced, borne out of fundamental misunderstandings of the purpose of mathematical modelling, what it is capable of – and how its results should be interpreted. Mathematical models are predicated on assumptions – how effective the vaccine is, how severe a variant is, what the impact of imposing or lifting whole rafts of mitigations will be. In trying to put a number on even these few unknowns, let alone the tens or even hundreds of others needed to represent reality, modellers are often searching in the dark with weak torches. That is why broad ranges of scenarios are modelled, and why strict caveats about the uncertainty in the potential outcomes typically accompany modelling reports. Mathematicians will be the first to tell you that the output of their models are “projections” predicated on their assumptions, not “predictions” to be viewed with certainty. To be fair to him, when Ferguson suggested the figure of 200,000 cases a day, he placed it in the context of the substantial uncertainty surrounding the projection. “And that’s where the crystal ball starts to fail,” he said, “… it’s much less certain.” Unfortunately, such caveats often get lost when modelling is simplified and turned into attention-grabbing headlines. One accusation levelled at UK modelling is that projections are often presented in the media with insufficient accompanying context. While it isn’t always possible to expect modellers who are working flat-out to find time to do media rounds, the resulting communication vacuum can leave results open to misinterpretation or exploitation by bad-faith actors. Critics of modelling also fail to acknowledge that highly publicised projections can become self-defeating prophecies. Top of the list of the Spectator’s “The ten worst Covid data failures” in the autumn of 2020 was “Overstating of the number of people who are going to die”. The article referred to the fact that Imperial College modellers’ infamous projection – that the UK would see 250,000 deaths in the absence of tighter measures – never came to pass. The Imperial model is widely credited with causing people to change their behaviour and with eventually ushering in the first UK lockdown a week later, thus averting its own alarming projections. Given that the UK has already passed 175,000 Covid deaths, it isn’t hard to imagine that upwards of 250,000 could have died as the result of an unmitigated epidemic wave. There have been scenarios in which modellers have taken missteps. Modellers often attempt to answer questions about subjects on which they are not experts. They need to collaborate closely with individuals and organisations who have relevant expertise. When considering care homes in the first wave of the pandemic, for instance, a number of salient risk factors – including the role of agency staff covering multiple care homes – were known to industry practitioners but were not anticipated by the mathematicians. These considerations meant that recommendations based on the modelling may have been unsound. There were more than 27,000 excess deaths in care homes during the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales. Data sharing between modelling groups has also been identified as an area that needs improvement. Early on in the pandemic, unequal access to data and poor communication were implicated in modelling results that suggested the UK’s epidemic trajectory was further behind Italy than it was, possibly contributing to a delay in our first lockdown. In these respects the pandemic has been a very public learning process for mathematicians. Every time someone interprets data – from professional mathematicians and politicians to the general public – they are using a model, whether they acknowledge it or not. The difference is that good modellers are upfront about the assumptions that influence their outcomes. If you don’t agree with the underlying assumptions then you should feel free to take issue with the projections – but dismissing conclusions because they don’t fit a worldview is naive, at best. Despite these reservations, modelling remains the best tool we have to predict the future. It provides a framework to formalise our assumptions about the scenarios we are trying to represent and to suggest what might happen under different policy options. It is always a better option than relying on the gut feelings, “common sense” or plain old wishful thinking that would replace it.

1/27/2022,"When harmonica legend Lee Oskar was seven years old and about to enter a new school, his mother gave him a stern warning. “‘If anybody asks what school you’re in, say it’s a religious school,’” Oskar recalled. “Never say ‘Jewish school’. There was always this intense fear about telling anyone I was Jewish.” Her warning came in 1955, a full decade after the defeat of the Nazis, when Oskar’s family was living in Copenhagen, one of the most accepting cities in Europe. But, as the musician says, “that didn’t matter. The fear never goes away.”  That’s especially true for families like Oskar’s. His mother and aunt are Holocaust survivors who experienced a litany of terrors as unimaginable as they are undeniable. And, as Oskar says, “those experiences don’t end with the people who survived them. It continues in their children and in future generations.” For Oskar, that meant a constant thrum of dread “that, at any moment, someone could come to my door and shoot me”. The feeling of ambient distress persisted even as Oskar grew to become a key member of one of the most successful and influential bands of the 70s, War. Their hits, from Low Rider to Cisco Kid to The World is a Ghetto, proved so rhythmically inventive and culturally resonant they remain touchstones of pop as well as lodestones of hip-hop sampling. While elements of Oskar’s family history subtly informed his work throughout his career, only now, at 73, has he created an album wholly focused on both the private processing, and the public preservation, of that legacy. An all-instrumental collection titled Never Forget, the album serves as what the musician calls “my musical memoir”. It features a wide palate of sound, from sweeping classical orchestrations and haunting klezmer interludes to intimate sections centered on an oud, a flamenco guitar and Oskar’s own supple harmonica. It’s his first solo work in 25 years, and the one he felt most compelled to create. “If I went to my grave and never expressed the fears and humiliations that have always been in me I would be ashamed of myself,” Oskar says during a Zoom interview from his home near Seattle. “I have a fiduciary responsibility to my art, to humanity and to my family to acknowledge that this happened.” To flesh the story out, pictures of his mother and aunt appear throughout the set’s elaborate packaging. But the full horror, as well as the surprising inspiration, embedded in their story can only be found in a riveting 1999 documentary about his aunt, Judy Meisel, titled Tak for Alt (Danish for “thanks for everything”). The mere outlines of the sisters’ horrific saga include being confined and starved as teenagers in the Kovno ghetto in their native Lithuania, before being sent to the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland where, upon arrival, a female SS officer tore every tuft of hair out of Meisel’s head by hand. At the camp, their mother was murdered in the gas chamber, a fate the sisters escaped by a fluke. From there, the young women endured a death march out of the camp while bombs exploded all around them, as well as a vexing time hiding under assumed names in a nunnery, before making their way to a boat bound for Denmark, which was torpedoed along the way. Oskar’s aunt Judy dedicated her life to speaking out about the sisters’ experiences, in schools, public lectures and for historical projects. She also made sure to connect their story to the American civil rights movement. But Oskar’s mother, Rachel, could never talk about it. “She was too devastated,” he says. “Because she was older than my aunt and so acted like a mother to her, it affected her differently.” At the same time, his mother had a non-verbal way of preserving her story. “She would write over and over again on little scraps of paper the timeline of her life, in Yiddish and Danish and English,” Oskar says. “She wanted people to know ‘I was in this killing camp.’” The experience kept her on perpetual edge. “Even when we watched a cowboy movie as kids, the sight of a gun would trigger her.” The intensity in the family affected Oskar deeply growing up. “There was no joy at home. I don’t think anything in their lives could be embraced the way they should have been.” Oskar began to find his own joy through music, though his parents never encouraged it. “I remember coming home at eight years old with a guitar and bongos we made at school. I was so excited. But it wasn’t like, ‘Oh, sweetheart, that’s nice.’ It was more like ‘What is this? You’re wasting your time.’” Harmonica entered his life as a child. “Every kid got one. The next year, it was the hula-hoop and then it was the yo-yo. But I kept playing harmonica.” The heaviness Oskar felt at home, as well as his ambitions to design a radically different life for himself, prompted him to leave not only his family but his country at 18. First, he came to New York and busked on the streets, before migrating to Los Angeles, where he met the other musicians who would comprise War. He also met Eric Burdon, who was seeking fresh artistic inspiration after the breakup of the Animals in 1969. By that time, Oskar had already changed his birth name, Oskar Levitin, to Lee Oskar, a decision partially driven by the desire to mask his Jewish identity. War released two albums with Burdon, marked by the Latin-tinged pop hit Spill the Wine as well as a growing reputation as an exceptional live act. In September 1970, a headline in NME labelled them “the best live band we’ve ever seen”. The performance that inspired that accolade later became historic for a jam between War and Jimi Hendrix that turned out to be the final performance by the guitarist, who died the next day. “Jimi wasn’t in good shape,” Oskar recalls. “He said to me, ‘Lee, am I playing OK?’” Yet he still managed to deliver some exemplary solos. After Burdon left the band, it looked to some observers like War itself might die. But Oskar says he never doubted a bright future for them given the chemistry between the players, the rarity of their image, and the singular breadth of their sound. Comprising Black, Latin and white members, War drew on R&B, soul, Latin music, rock, pop and jazz. While they racked up a long list of smash singles, their full albums offered a far more expansive sound, rife with elaborate solos and complex rhythms. “If you just heard the singles, you really missed the boat,” says Oskar. A unique factor in War’s sound was the decision to place Oskar’s harmonica in the context of a horn section along with saxophonist Charles Miller. The two players created the 12-note call-and-response in Low Rider that remains one of music’s most recognizable, and coolest, hooks. “We loved to create those counter-melodies,” Oskar says. War’s approach to vocals also stood out, both as a sound and as a symbol. Various members often sang in unison, giving the music the feel of a community in conversation, clamorous but convivial. The effect communicated a message of unity that made War’s sound and sensibility the opposite of its namesake. While still with the band, Oskar began releasing solo albums in 1975 with a self-titled work. By the next year, he was voted the top instrumental artist by Billboard. In 1980, the title track of his album My Road, Our Road, explored some of the themes that would finally come to fruition more than 40 years later on Never Forget. A very different version of the old track My Road serves as the new album’s finale, which is Oskar’s way of extending his relatives’ path through his own. Another song on the new album, Miracle Children, borrows a phrase his aunt Judy often used to describe Oskar, as well as his siblings and cousins, for being the offspring his mother and aunt never expected to have. Though the album uses no words to convey its message, Oskar feels “the music isn’t missing anything. I’m singing with my harmonica.” For Oskar, the creation of the album has had a liberating effect, exorcizing what had haunted and inspired him for so long. Sadly, both his mother and his aunt died before they could hear the final music; Judy Meisel died just this last year at 91. Throughout their lives after the war, the sisters remained alert to the successive waves of Holocaust deniers, and alarmed by the lure of authoritarian regimes, some of which are, again, on the rise in the very areas they escaped 70 years ago. “The horrific things that humanity has done to each other keep repeating,” Oskar says. “No matter how many generations come along, you can never totally overcome it.” Never Forget is released on 28 January",Arts/Music,‘You can never totally overcome it’: harmonica legend Lee Oskar on his family’s Holocaust trauma,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/26/lee-oskar-harmonica-music-war-holocaust
