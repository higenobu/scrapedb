4/12/2022,"Good morning. I’m Virginia Harrison and these are today’s top stories. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has voiced concerns that Russian forces are preparing “a new stage of terror” that could involve the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. “Today the occupiers issued a new statement, which testifies to their preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders,” Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. “One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible.” Ukrainian authorities on Monday claimed Russia dropped a drone carrying a toxic substance on the southern port city but the report has not been confirmed. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said work was under way to verify the claim, adding: “Any use of such weapons would be a callous escalation in this conflict and we will hold [Vladimir] Putin and his regime to account.” The comments came as the mayor of Mariupol said that more than 10,000 civilians had died so far in the Russian siege of the city. In an interview with the Associated Press, Vadym Boychenko said the death toll could surpass 20,000, with weeks of attacks and privation leaving the bodies of Mariupol’s people “carpeted through the streets”. Amid signs of a possible major Russian military offensive in Ukraine’s east, intelligence services and Iraqi militias told the Guardian the Kremlin was receiving munitions and military hardware sourced from Iraq for its war effort.

In an interview with the Guardian amid controversy over the tax status of Sunak’s wife, Starmer said having a spouse who was a non-dom would create a “very obvious conflict of interest” for any cabinet minister. He called on the prime minister to make clear that no other cabinet ministers had taken advantage of non-dom status, used tax havens or benefited from offshore trusts. Sunak has referred himself to the adviser on ministerial interests for an inquiry, and his wife, Akshata Murty, last week said she would pay all UK tax on foreign earnings in future. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, also admitted on Sunday to having been a non-dom for six years while a banker, before he was an MP. Khan verdict – MPs have expressed outrage over comments made by the Conservative MP Crispin Blunt about the guilty verdict in Imran Ahmad Khan’s sexual assault trial. Blunt, the MP for Reigate since 1997 and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on LGBT+ rights, said he was certain Khan was innocent and that the trial “was nothing short of an international scandal”. Khan, the MP for Wakefield, was expelled from the Conservative party with “immediate effect” hours after being convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. “I am utterly appalled and distraught at the dreadful miscarriage of justice that has befallen my friend and colleague Imran Ahmad Khan,” Blunt said in a statement. Three MPs have since resigned from the APPG – Scottish National party MPs Stewart McDonald and Joanna Cherry, and Labour MP Chris Bryant. Khan was already sitting as an independent MP after the Conservative whip was suspended before his trial, and he may be able to continue in the role for some time while he appeals against the verdict. The firm representing Khan, Janes Solicitors, said he maintained his innocence and would “be appealing as soon as possible”. Pass the painkillers - Almost one in six people around the world have a headache on any given day, with about half of those experiencing a migraine, researchers have found. Headache disorders can be painful and debilitating and have myriad causes, from stress to over-use of medications such as painkillers. Now a large scale review has highlighted just how common such conditions are. The results, published in the Journal of Headache and Pain, suggest more than half of the world’s population – 52% – have an active headache disorder, typically described as experiencing some type of headache during the past year. Wild swimming – A stretch of the Thames is to get bathing status for the first time, in an attempt to ensure the water becomes safe and clean for swimming. Part of the Wolvercote Mill Stream at Port Meadow in Oxford, an area popular with wild swimmers, will be only the second inland stretch of water to be officially designated as bathing water from next month. Last year, a stretch of the River Wharfe in Ilkley, Yorkshire, became the first river in England to be given bathing status in the hope it would pressure water companies to stop discharging sewage into the picturesque site. Critics in the Conservative party say the broadcaster’s best years are behind it and privatisation is the answer. But what would be lost in the process?

But can therapists make a difference and is seeking treatment just a form of denial? Rory McIlroy has been dejected enough times when exiting on to Washington Road via Magnolia Lane that he is entitled to savour a sense of harmony after leaving Augusta National this year. Tiger Woods has ranked playing four rounds at Augusta as one of his greatest achievements and confirmed he will be at St Andrews. Fresh claims have emerged regarding the incident that contributed to the omission of Mike Brown and Ben Te’o from Eddie Jones’s squad in the lead-up to the 2019 Rugby World Cup and in effect brought the international careers of both players to an abrupt close. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has issued a scathing assessment of the former Formula One race director Michael Masi, whose actions were decisive in denying Lewis Hamilton a potential eighth championship last season. The Tunisian Olympic sailor Eya Guezguez has died in a training accident at the age of 17, the International Olympic Committee has announced. The England captain, Leah Williamson, has described Northern Ireland as a “serious contender” ahead of the Lionesses’ World Cup qualifier at Windsor Park on Tuesday evening. Growth in UK retail sales slowed last month as fears over the rising cost of living led to the sharpest drop in consumer confidence since the 2008 financial crisis, according to industry data. The British Retail Consortium said total sales rose by 3.1% in March compared with the same month a year earlier, significantly down on the 6.7% increase in February and 12-month average growth rate of 10.3%. The pound is buying $1.302 and 1.197. The war in Ukraine fills several front pages. The Metro has “The last stand” in its report on the besieged city of Mariupol. The i newspaper splashes with “Revealed: Putin’s plan to resettle Ukrainians” and the FT has “Ukraine appeals for financial aid to survive wounds of Russia’s war”. The Guardian leads with its Keir Starmer interview: “Sunak an ‘out of touch’ hypocrite over tax avoidance, says Starmer” is the headline. The Mail has “Emergency bid to avert Easter airport chaos” while the Times goes for “Summer of travel chaos warning for passengers”. The Telegraph reports “GPs told to work late to avoid A&E chaos”. The Mirror leads on the cost of living crisis with the headline “We’ll never put on our heating again”. The Express has “Rescue package pleas for millions facing £1K bills hike”. The Sun’s headline reads “We’ll cut your fingers off”, alleging that a gang threatened to torture ex-footballer Ashley Cole.

4/12/2022,"Teachers will discuss the “dehumanising” impact pornography has on students at a national conference this week. Educators attending the National Education Union’s (NEU) event in Bournemouth are expected to raise concerns over “the prevalence of pornography which shows the harmful and humiliating treatment of women”. The conference will also explore whether current sex and relationships education adequately deals with issues of misogyny, sexism and consent, or leaves students vulnerable to being “miseducated” by watching porn. A 2020 survey by Brook, a sexual health and wellbeing charity for young people, concluded that young people believed a lack of information from schools and parents was leaving them at risk, and felt that higher quality sex education would leave them feeling more empowered. The NEU is particularly concerned by the findings of a 2021 Ofsted report which found that 90% of girls and 50% of boys had reported that either they or their peers had been sent explicit pictures they did not wish to see “a lot” or “sometimes”. The review was launched after thousands of disclosures on the website Everyone’s Invited about sexual harassment and sexual violence involving state and independent schools, as well as universities. More than 51,000 testimonies have since been shared on the site, naming hundreds of educational settings across the UK. Disclosures made by pupils and students highlight the full spectrum of abusive behaviour in schools, from lower-level harassment to serious sexual assault and rape. At the conference, the NEU will look at evidence that pornography “predominantly features young women being subjected to acts of violence such as strangulation and choking as well as racialised tropes, all of which dehumanise women”, as well as debate the increasingly sexualised nature of social media. Teachers are also set to discuss whether incidents of sexual harassment – on and offline – should be consistently recorded by schools so that worrying patterns can be identified and adult intervention taken to protect pupils from escalating abuse. The NEU annual conference (11 April to 14 April) will be attended by up to 1,600 delegates.",News/Education,Teachers to discuss impact of pornography on pupils at conference,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/12/teachers-to-discuss-impact-of-pornography-on-pupils-at-conference
4/12/2022,"With Romanesque campaniles, gothic spires and brutalist bell towers, Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles has long been home to an eclectic parade of religious fantasies. Beginning in the 1920s, when the mid-Wilshire area was an upper-class suburban enclave, congregations competed to construct their outsize monuments along this major east-west thoroughfare. Gothic revival churches jostled for position with neo-Byzantine temples, as the city grew west from the congested downtown. Like many things in LA, these buildings seem designed to be experienced from a moving vehicle. Their proportions are puffed up and ornate details simplified, as if scaled to give a drive-by blessing. When you’re stuck in traffic, the gigantic rose windows and dreaming spires might offer a brief moment of roadside redemption. These days, as the heart of Koreatown, this holy stretch is also lined with bulgogi barbecue joints and 24-hour spas at the base of office towers, making the sanctuaries look like relics of a bygone age. That is, until you arrive at the corner of Wilshire and Harvard boulevards where, almost a century since most of these shrines were built, God appears to be back with a bang. Or a clunk. Jutting out towards the street like an angular aircraft hangar, the new addition to the Wilshire Boulevard Temple is hard to miss. The skewed concrete container is covered with a frenzied wrapping of ribbed hexagonal panels, each punctured by a letterbox window, rotated at angles to form a jumbled patchwork. A big arched entrance is punched into one side, while a lozenge-shaped void is sliced out of another, glowing an eerie shade of green from within. The whole thing is ringed with a tall steel fence, along with rows of bollards and defensive raised planters, lending the monolithic mass a fortified air. It looks like it could be a high-security laboratory for a biotech firm, but this looming shed is in fact a new $95m events space for the Jewish congregation and the surrounding community. Named the Audrey Irmas Pavilion, after its chief benefactor – a philanthropist and art collector, who sold a Cy Twombly painting for $60m and donated half of the proceeds – it is the work of feted firm OMA, the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, marking their first major building in the city. “It is a gift,” says the temple, “to all who delight in the joy of gathering.” If you can find the entrance, that is. For a place dedicated to bringing people together, it’s quite tricky to get inside. Where you might expect to find the main entrance on Wilshire Boulevard, there is a big pair of metal gates that remain firmly locked, except for on high holy days. Instead, visitors must go around the back of the block and enter through the uninviting base of a multistorey parking garage, go through a security check, then walk through a school campus to reach the pavilion. The result, observed on a recent visit, is gridlocked traffic along the sidestreet, as cars queue to get into the parking structure. So far, so LA. The primary challenge facing the architects was how to respond to the formidable temple, next to which the new building stands, on a former parking lot. Built in 1929, for LA’s oldest Jewish congregation, this neo-Byzantine confection was the ultimate Hollywood dream of what a sanctuary could be. It was the vision of Edgar Magnin, the charismatic “Rabbi to the stars”, who had it modelled on the Pantheon in Rome, with an immense 100-ft-wide dome lined with mesmerising octagonal coffers that rise to a glowing blue oculus, simulating an eternally cloudless southern California sky. Its interior heaves with black Belgian marble columns, teakwood doors and bronze chandeliers, along with a magnificent mural depicting 3,000 years of Jewish history, gifted by the Warner brothers. In a fitting touch of Hollywood fakery, all is not what is seems: knock the “stone” walls of the ambulatory and you’ll hear the hollow sound of a painted stage set. By the 1990s, the fate of the majestic temple was uncertain. Most of the congregation had moved west, where a second campus was built, leaving a question mark hanging over the future of the original home. Faced with the decision of whether to sell the building, the leaders noticed a trend for younger Jewish people moving east, and so decided to restore the temple and reinvigorate the site with a new events space, aimed at drawing a more youthful crowd. The addition would have to respect the historic temple while forging a bold new image of its own, creating a desirable venue for weddings, bar and batmitzvahs, and other glitzy banquets – “a machine for gathering”, as the architects put it, but also one for generating income. The choice of architect was heavily influenced by Eli Broad, the suburban housing tycoon turned cultural philanthropist, who was instrumental in convening an all-star competition shortlist in 2015, comprising Kengo Kuma, Steven Holl, Morphosis and OMA, whom he each paid $100,000 to participate. Broad had history with Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch founder of OMA. As a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, he had championed Koolhaas’s ambitious proposals to rebuild the museum from scratch in the early 2000s, before opting for a cheaper scheme by Renzo Piano. Similarly, he shortlisted OMA for his own downtown art museum, the Broad, but awarded the commission to Diller Scofidio + Renfro instead. Was the Wilshire job to be something of a consolation prize, after years of dashed hopes? The resulting building might make some Angelenos thankful that OMA’s output here has been limited to a Prada store until now. It reads like a dutiful replay of the practice’s familiar method – a diagrammatic stack of functions, wrapped in a geometric skin – but it somehow lacks the sense of wit, tension or abrasion that has made their best buildings so compelling. Koolhaas was involved in the competition, but the project is credited to Shohei Shigematsu, who has headed OMA’s New York office for the last decade, and it was executed with the help of Gruen Associates, the LA firm of the late Victor Gruen, godfather of the shopping mall, whose ghost haunts some of the details. Koolhaas’s celebrity status was key for fundraising: he was wheeled out for events and commissioned to design custom mezuzahs – small boxes containing a prayer parchment, fixed to doorways as a reminder of faith – creating 99 little blocks of foamed aluminium and coloured resin, sponsored for $10,000 a pop (including one to keep for your own home). True to form, the architects began with a big box, then tilted it away from the temple in an act of deference, and pushed it towards the street as a signal of invitation, birthing the wonky trapezoid. Within this shell, they stacked three principal volumes: a vaulted events hall at the bottom, its arched shape a nod to the temple’s domed silhouette; a chapel and meeting rooms in the middle, tinted green to reflect the verdigris patina of the copper dome; and a circular sunken terrace at the top lined with blue concrete, to echo the oculus. Finally, the dome’s tessellated ceiling provided the inspiration for the supersized honeycomb wrapper, scaled up to form the jazzy, highway-friendly facade. The result feels like a forced attempt at being contextual, from a practice that doesn’t usually care much for context. It reads as an oddly disjointed collage of sampled visual motifs, with little to tie it all together. Entering through an arched portal, you arrive in the main hall, where parabolic arches clad in sassandra wood veneer leap above a pink terrazzo floor, framing windows that look in from the landing levels above. The room has an art deco air, recalling spaces such as the Royal Horticultural Society’s Lawrence Hall in London, or Nairobi’s City Market, where raw concrete ribs soar above the halls, with stepped glazing in between. OMA proposed exposed concrete here, too, but the temple leaders understandably wanted something warmer for their prize ballroom. The effect feels flattening, the wall-to-wall veneer exuding hotel lobby vibes – livened up on this visit by neon palm trees being wheeled into place for a batmitzvah. Another recent event saw it transformed into a sugarcoated candyland worthy of Willy Wonka. The level above houses an indoor-outdoor chapel, for Friday evening Shabbat services, conceived as a trapezoidal void punched through the width of the building, lined with emerald green glazing and metal mesh, adding a subtle shimmer. Large windows slide open to a terrace that looks on to the temple, its stained glass providing an atmospheric backdrop to night-time events, while a window in the floor creates a nice connection with the hall below. The framed views are a successful move, but once again, the space feels out of tune, more like a place for corporate board meetings than communing with higher powers. The top floor was originally planned to be offices, but it has been taken over by the Annenberg Foundation and transformed into GenSpace, a “centre for healthy ageing” with a programme of activities for older adults. The fit-out is still under way, but the floor doesn’t seem particularly well suited to its purpose, with big structural beams shooting through the rooms in classic OMA style. Meanwhile the sunken blue terrace is more office breakout space than seniors’ garden, with a staircase to the roof that doesn’t scream older people-friendly.Relief finally comes at the rooftop, where a terrace provides great panoramic views, from the towers of Century City in the west, to the Hollywood sign to the north, and the mountains to the east. It makes for an ideal vantage point to look back at the historic temple, and across to the brutalist Catholic church – without the new pavilion getting in the way.",Arts/Art and design,Sacred space or corporate lobby?

4/12/2022,"Pete Knapp, 36, who lives in London, has visited North Korea, travelled overland from Kenya to Cape Town, motorcycled through Japan and Cambodia and trekked by horse through China. Until a few years ago, “I felt invincible,” he says. He had never experienced anxiety, or worried about the climate crisis. Then, in 2019, he went to Borneo. “I remember flying in one of those small planes over a part of Borneo that used to be rainforest but is now a palm oil plantation. The whole landscape was this monoculture,” he says. He spent days trying to find orangutans in the wild, and, when he finally found the primary rainforest that remained, he saw “such depth, character, colour and variety” that he felt horrified by the “quiet, dead, grey, nothingness” replacing it. “It hammered home how our lifestyles and diets had caused so much destruction to this part of the world that is so precious. When you go to a supermarket and buy food, you don’t see the cost of it. That was the first time I saw the cost.” It marked the end of his travels and feeling of invincibility, and the beginning of what he now calls climate anxiety. This emotional state includes feelings as varied as fear and helplessness, guilt, shame, loss, betrayal and abandonment, and it can take different shapes in each individual. Anouchka Grose, a psychoanalyst and the author of A Guide to Eco-Anxiety, How to Protect the Planet and Your Mental Health, says some patients describe staying awake all night thinking of coral reefs, bush fires and ice caps melting. Some might “walk into a shop and freak out because they suddenly see it as it is,” how “all the things in front of you are in damaging forms of packaging, freighted from goodness knows where, covered in pesticides”. In her book, someone describes looking at a friend’s take-away coffee: “It makes me sad and alarmed, imagining millions of people out there, just like him, with one throwaway plastic cup, millions of times over every day.” For Knapp, it was the feeling of having “the rug pulled from under my feet; that I was enjoying a life that was ruining the world”. For Natasha James, 33, a training manager in Portsmouth, it was reading article after article in a paralysing spiral: “It would get to the stage where I would freeze.” Their climate anxiety began at 12, when their science teacher spoke about the hole in the ozone layer and global heating. “I remember my stomach dropped, and I thought, ‘Oh, my God! I’ve never heard about this before; why are people not talking about it? Why are we not doing anything about it?’”. Molecular biologist Abi Perrin, 32, describes the physical sensations she experienced after reading the 2018 report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): “My heart was pounding. My chest felt tight every time I thought about it – and I couldn’t not think about it. I’d often burst into tears because it felt overwhelming. It’s like a pit in your stomach – you feel weirdly empty. It’s not always the same, but it sometimes takes the form of feeling very sad, hopeless and alone.” The biggest ever scientific study on climate anxiety and young people, published last year in the Lancet, found that nearly six in 10 people aged 16 to 25 were very or extremely worried about climate breakdown, nearly half of them reported climate distress or anxiety affecting their daily lives, and three-quarters agreed that “the future is frightening”. All the therapists I spoke to reported seeing a significant increase in climate anxiety in their consulting rooms. So, can therapy help? There is a danger, in suggesting that therapy might help, of pathologising climate anxiety; turning it into a mental health problem that needs to be cured – medicated or spirited away with mindfulness or talking therapy . Many people I interviewed were faced with such reactions from friends, family, colleagues, GPs, and, occasionally, even therapists. This is not how the author of Psychological Roots of the Climate Crisis Sally Weintrobe thinks. “It is important to say that anxiety is a signal that there is something wrong. It’s a perfectly normal healthy reaction to a worrying situation. We mustn’t pathologise climate anxiety. Obviously it can get very extreme – but I would say that government inaction on the climate crisis is pretty extreme, so it’s hardly surprising that people are very worried.” What Knapp, James and Perrin said helped them most was having their emotions validated in therapy – and understanding that their feelings were meaningful and valuable. Caroline Hickman, a psychotherapist, climate psychology researcher and board member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, says, “I would worry about people who aren’t distressed – given that this is what is happening, how come?” She believes that people are using psychological defences such as denial “as a way of coping and reducing the fear that they feel”. This can leave the climate-anxious with a sense of isolation, frustration and abandonment, as others tell themselves, “Oh, well, the government will save us; technology will save us; if it was that bad, somebody would have done something,” she says. “Those are all rationalisations against existential terror of annihilation – and that’s the reality of what we’re potentially looking at.” To face this reality is to come out of what Weintrobe calls “the climate bubble”, which, she says, “has been supported by a culture of uncare, a culture that actively seeks to keep us in a state of denial about the severity of the climate crisis”. She explains: “The bubble protects you from reality, and when you start seeing the reality, it’s hardly surprising that you’re going to experience a whole series of shocks.” She prefers the term climate trauma over anxiety because “it is traumatising to see that you are caught up in a way of living, whether you like it or not, that makes you a victim and a perpetrator of damaging the Earth, which is what keeps us all alive”. We are living, she says, “in a political system that generates a mental health crisis, because it places burdens on people that are too much to bear, as well as burdens on the Earth”. The thing about trauma is that it can reignite earlier, individual trauma. That experience of coming out of the climate bubble and having your worries dismissed, of realising that you have been abandoned by people who were supposed to look after you, can be particularly triggering. For Weintrobe, this is where therapy can have a role to play, “in helping people to disentangle what is personal to them and their own individual histories, from what is hitting them from the outside”. Perrin describes how speaking to her therapist helped in ways she didn’t expect. She says: “Having that space to have those conversations and be honest about how I felt was really valuable. I went into it thinking I wanted practical advice about how to solve this, but that was not what I got and not what I needed. It helped me to understand that what I was feeling was not wrong.” It also helped her to get a better sense of her anxiety: “I think it might come from feeling lots of things and not actually understanding what they are.” She still experiences anxiety, but it doesn’t escalate in the way it did before. “I know that it’s rooted in something real, and that even if the situation doesn’t change, the intensity of that feeling can, and will, pass.” As a climate-anxious pupil at school, James was told that this feeling was “irrational” by the therapist they saw at the time. It was while reading article after article late at night that James landed on one about climate anxiety, and recognised their own experience. They decided to try treatment again, and contacted Patrick Kennedy-Williams. First, they say, he told them their fears were valid and rational. Then they discussed how to get a better balance of climate news by also reading positive stories about people who are taking action, as well as limiting internet access on their phone. This brings to mind how, in her climate-aware therapeutic work, Hickman draws on her experience, in the 1990s, of treating young people, who were HIV positive, with about a year to live. A significant number were, through therapy, “able to change their relationship with their diagnosis and not just live in fear of death, but learn to live their lives wholeheartedly, with death as part of it,” she says. They left relationships that were unsatisfactory, left jobs that they hated, and “they learned to live their lives fully and with meaning, not in denial that their lives might be shorter, but that that didn’t have to define their lives – it was just part of it”. It is perhaps surprising to hear Weintrobe – a psychoanalyst – say that while there is a role for therapy in addressing climate anxiety, it is limited. We need to normalise this distress, she says, but not by pretending it’s not there, or shouldn’t be. “It’s very perverse that normalising has come to mean getting rid of anything that’s disturbing. Can we make it normal that we are very disturbed and bothered by what is going on, and help each other?” She recommends meeting to talk in groups about climate anxiety, such as at the climate cafes run by the Climate Psychology Alliance. Hickman runs psycho-educational groups with youth activists to address the impact of the climate crisis on mental health, where they discuss ways to support themselves and each other. Elouise Mayall, 24, and living in Canterbury, is a master’s student in ecology and a climate activist with the UK Youth Climate Coalition who has taken part in Hickman’s groups and workshops. Her climate anxiety began when she left university and realised how unconcerned others were – what she calls leaving the “green bubble”. In her 20s, she felt intense pressure, guilt, shame and anxiety to produce less and do everything to make up for what others were not doing. After joining UKYCC, her anxiety started to improve, through being part of a community. She says that Hickman’s workshops have helped her and her colleagues to recognise “the emotional strain” of the work they do, and to learn to rest. They are now far more “mindful of each other’s mental health”, and people don’t feel guilty when they need a break, so are less likely to “crash and burnout”. Mayall has also developed a different relationship with her climate anxiety. Previously, she says, “I was very dismissive and grumpy about having it. I wanted to suppress it or get rid of it – I thought it was an indulgence because people are dying, so why was I fussing around with feelings?” She felt she should be happy all the time. Now, she recognises that “it isn’t bad, wrong, or inconvenient for me to have climate anxiety, because it ultimately means that I care about the climate crisis”. She uses an ecological metaphor to describe how she relates to her feelings now: “Biodiversity is important because the more complex an ecosystem is, the more stable it is, and the more resilient it is to any disturbances or damage that comes along”. A monoculture, such as the one Knapp saw from that plane in Borneo, makes for a very fragile ecosystem; the same is true of an emotional monoculture. Allowing herself to experience whatever emotions she is feeling, including guilt and shame, has brought her a kind of emotional biodiversity, and a more sustainable way of life. Since starting therapy James has attended a climate cafe, signed up to workshops, written to their local MP and published articles online to spread awareness. Perrin says therapy has helped her support herself and other activists. She is now researching microscopic algae, and their potential to help us live more sustainably. After what he saw in Borneo, and his research into the apocalyptic impact of climate breakdown, Knapp’s view of the world and of his future collapsed. He felt betrayed by the government, and despairing of the inaction of those around him. He became increasingly isolated and, for a time, suicidal. He found a way out of this by joining Extinction Rebellion, where friends recommended a therapist. He has since changed his life, becoming a researcher in air quality and a climate activist, giving up his beloved Mini, going vegan and making a podcast with fellow activists about how they cope with climate anxiety and what inspires them . He hasn’t been on a plane since. These stories recall a comment from Grose, that the word “anxious” has two definitions: one can feel anxious due to a nebulous fear, or one can be anxious to do something – to be willing to act, with urgency. As I researched this article, I noticed an intensifying feeling of unease and tension. Last week, the IPCC reported that it is “now or never” if we are to stave off climate disaster, and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned: “Some government and business leaders are saying one thing – but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.” I know I need to read the report, to see the scientific reality of where we are, but I am not, yet, able to. I am frightened to leave the climate bubble. I tell Weintrobe about my anxious feelings, and she says reporters often phone her and say, “I feel overwhelmed, being a climate journalist.” I find her next words strangely hopeful. “I feel overwhelmed, too. Sometimes, I find myself lying on the sofa, unable to move because it’s all so worrying. But you get out of it, and you carry on.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/12/2022,"A stretch of the Thames is to get bathing status for the first time, in an attempt to ensure the water becomes safe and clean for swimming. Part of the Wolvercote Mill Stream at Port Meadow, Oxford, an area popular with wild swimmers, will be only the second inland stretch of water to be officially designated as bathing water from next month. Last year, a stretch of the River Wharfe in Ilkley, Yorkshire became the first river in England to be given bathing status in the hope it would pressure water companies to stop discharging sewage into the picturesque site, where people often swim. The water has not yet been cleaned up and was recently given a poor water quality rating. Campaigners have been asking for more rivers across England to be given bathing status because it adds requirements to the site that could improve water quality. At these sites, the Environment Agency has to regularly take samples from the water to assess the level of water quality and whether action is needed to cut bacteria levels. It is hoped that if the areas are branded poor quality, it may pressure water companies to stop discharging raw sewage. The government is asking local people to nominate areas near them as bathing water sites to ensure areas where people swim, paddleboard and kayak are monitored. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: “The residents of Oxford and the Isle of Wight have shown their overwhelming approval for these sites as places to enjoy and connect with nature, so I am pleased to see these locations receiving designated bathing water status. While bathing water quality has improved in recent years and England now has the cleanest bathing waters since records began, we know that water quality at these sites won’t change overnight. It will take time and all those with a role to play must commit to achieve the necessary improvements. “We are continuing to drive up the quality of lakes, rivers and seas for the public to enjoy through the measures in our Environment Act, and I would encourage more applications for popular bathing areas, both inland and coastal, that may also be suitable for designation.” Monitoring will begin from 15 May, the beginning of the bathing water season, with results of the water quality tests expected in the autumn. A coastal site at East Cowes Esplanade on the Isle of Wight is also to receive a bathing water designation. Data released last week showed that water companies discharged raw sewage into English rivers 372,533 times last year, a slight reduction on the previous year. The water companies covering England released untreated sewage for a combined total of more than 2.7m hours, compared with 3.1m hours in 2020. The government recently revealed its plans to reduce sewage pollution, committing to 70% fewer discharges close to bathing waters by 2035 during the bathing season, with significant reductions expected outside the bathing season as well. However, nature campaigners said the plans fall short and that under them England’s rivers will still be choked by sewage.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Thames at Oxford to get bathing status in effort to clean up English rivers,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/12/thames-at-oxford-to-get-bathing-status-in-effort-to-clean-up-english-rivers
4/12/2022,"Ripe plums fall into Labour’s lap. Without the opposition lifting a finger, each day brings another revelation that tells wavering voters all they need to know about what these bumptious ministers think of the little people for whom they set the rules. The world of golden wallpaper, 3am Downing Street karaoke parties and £335 trainers might have provided vicarious glamour in normal times, but not when living standards are plunging and so many people have raw memories of lockdowns and lives lost. I was recently sent the words of the chair of a local Conservative association. With shameless cynicism, his “political overview” opened by referencing war: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine has taken the headlines away from Partygate. The absence of a vote of no confidence in the leadership means we now have the opportunity to stabilise the leadership and rebuild trust with the electorate and of course our lead in the polls.” As it is, recent polls put Labour at 39%, the Tories on 35%. “Rebuilding trust” looks a bit herculean right now. A newly “serious” Johnson-of-Ukraine could revive party loyalties. If not, Labour could win as the capable, clean and decent alternative to this corrupt, arrogant and politically tin-eared crew. But I am taken aback by people I meet – keen followers of politics – who struggle to define what Labour stands for. “On your side” is OK, but Labour still fumbles for what George HW Bush once clumsily called “the vision thing”. Oppositions struggle to be heard. Labour is brim full of policies, more radical than it gets credit for, more radical than Tony Blair’s in 1997, but often lost in the government’s noisy command of the news agenda. Some do land with impact, That windfall tax on North Sea oil companies awash in profits – to help recompense hard-pressed bill-payers and extend the warm home discount – hit home against the chancellor’s mean austerity. Rachel Reeves, who has promised to be “the first green chancellor”, mapped out a huge £28bn-a-year green investment to kickstart the economy with battery “gigafactories”, insulating 19m homes, and massively increasing wind power; but Labour hasn’t yet received the credit its ambitious plans merit. The same goes for Reeves’s promise to abolish small business rates – replacing them with a 12% tax on big tech – to restore high streets. As Reeves reviews an estimated £175bn worth of tax reliefs, she has already committed to equalising tax rate on earned and unearned incomes, as well as targeting landlord rents, private equity and “carried interest” loopholes. It makes a strong contrast with these non-dom, tax-minimising ministers, never straight about their money until half-truths are dragged out of them. Sajid Javid’s former non-dom status, because his father was born in Pakistan, defies any notion of tax fairness: if it was morally OK, why drop it when you enter politics? Labour’s radical tax clean-up needs to be heard, and to yield richly for the Treasury. While the government’s promised employment rights bill has vanished, Labour – true to its name – would revolutionise the power balance in the workplace. Reeves has promised “radical insourcing” to bring services back into the public sector from profiteering contractors. Labour policies would have made P&O’s disgraceful abuse impossible, by banning zero-hours contracts, “fire and rehire” and bogus self-employment. It would ensure employment rights started on day one, and that all workers enjoyed the benefits of sick pay, parental leave and protection from unfair dismissal, with flexible hours the default. These policies would transform millions of working lives. A new right for unions to recruit in every workplace, and fair pay agreements in every sector, would reset decades of rewards unjustly flowing backwards from workforce to shareholders, turning the tables on bad employers not just in sectors such as care, deliveries, warehouses and retail, but higher up the scale as well. Yet here too, Labour struggles to be heard. As voters would expect from Labour’s successes on schools and the NHS whenever it has been in power, the party has convincing priorities for repairing the damage done to both since 2010. It has pledged a renewed emphasis on early years, permanent mental health support in every school, universal breakfast and after-school clubs, and a youth drop-in mental health hub in every area. “Excellence” plans are not all Gradgrind: they include a guarantee for every child on arts, sport and expeditions – funding that was stripped out by Tory cuts. An eye-catching pledge to charge VAT on private school fees would raise £1.7bn to spend on state schools, and is in stark contrast to Rishi Sunak’s personal £100,000 donation to Winchester college. The need to clean up Westminster – with its tainted donations and lobbying by MPs with second jobs – hardly needs mentioning. Levelling up, too, is natural Labour turf, in its DNA, from restoring the £20 cut to benefits to introducing a genuine national living wage. The party has pledged not to “balance the books on the backs of working people” as George Osborne and Sunak have done. While the government fails on its impossible northern promises (not one spade is in the ground for its proposed local rail projects), Gordon Brown is producing local devolution plans. At local elections in May, crime will be home territory for former chief prosecutor Keir Starmer. On Monday, he promised to create “victim payback boards” for local communities to settle antisocial behaviour. These may sound like small potatoes – but many complain about being powerless to act in their neighbourhoods. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, recently made a speech calling for a radical rethink of foreign policy, and laying out what “make Brexit work” should look like, swivelling back to European security, reversing army cuts and escaping Britain’s fuel dependency on autocrats. He promised to restore the country’s soft power against what he fears is the “age of authoritarians”, with full foreign aid and a strong BBC World Service and British Council. In two years, Starmer has turned Labour into a force that is now well beyond its initial “permission to be heard” stage. Now, people need to know what Labour will do. The policy samples I’ve mentioned are random: I could list shelves-full of others, each costed under Reeves’s grip, her fiscal rules underpinned with a new “office for value for money”. For the first time in recent years, Labour is starting to lead on the economy. But it’s still not trusted on defence, where Labour is on 19% and the Tories 38%. Put out more flags and talk loudly of security, for defence now tops Ipsos Mori’s list of public concerns. Labour can’t let Boris Johnson’s posturing occupy this ground.But policies on their own are not enough. A few chosen beacons need to illuminate the way. This shadow cabinet barely needs lift a finger to discredit this self-disgracing government, but Labour has yet to crystallise its meaning. It takes time to implant an idea in the public mind, and time may be short, if Johnson’s fortunes ever momentarily look up and he dashes for an election.

4/12/2022,"Think Peckham market traders ducking and diving for a living. Neurotic hoteliers struggling to run a clapped-out guesthouse. As a rule, sitcoms are built around a distinctive premise or setting and then populated by a bunch of characters, on whose popularity success will depend. One might quibble with the wisdom of reviving these sitcoms, for the stage or any other medium, 40 years after the event – as I did when watching The Good Life at the Theatre Royal Bath a few months back. But at least it’s possible, because – even if you can’t duplicate a Richard Briers or a John Cleese – there’s a predicament there, an inherently amusing situation, on which to build. But then there’s that subset of sitcoms built around their characters alone, whose whole basis is: let’s wind this character up and watch them do their thing. Count Arthur Strong is one; Miranda is another. So too is Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em, a 70s favourite (25 million viewers!) whose premise is simply: hapless man has accidents. Such a show stands or falls on its casting, and Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em had casting for the ages. I’ve been watching old episodes in advance of seeing the new theatrical adaptation. Aside from the nostalgia rush of re-engaging with a show that stirs my very earliest family-TV memories, the pleasure has all been about Michael Crawford’s beautiful turn as walking calamity Frank Spencer – with a side order of respect for his on-screen wife and perfect foil, Michelle Dotrice. Watch the first episode and the absence of a premise is, at first, disconcerting. Perhaps in 1973, when gender roles were less flexible, it was starting point enough to feature an enfeebled and neurotic young husband, incapable of holding down a job or being masculine in any way. To modern eyes, this shades into cartoon: we’re not watching Fleabag any more. And in anyone else’s hands, Frank Spencer might have been too much: too fey, too irritating, too tragic. There’s a very narrow sweet spot to aim for here, where his naivety and lucklessness are funny not frustrating, where his sentimental nature stays the right side of mawkishness. Crawford nails it, and does so without visibly trying to make us laugh. As his career before (starring alongside Barbra Streisand in the Oscar-winning Hello Dolly, bizarrely) and since suggests, this is a proper craftsperson of stage and screen. You could enjoy Frank Spencer, proto-Mr Bean that he is, with the sound down: Crawford’s expressions, his reactions, his every gesture a minutely choreographed dumbshow of illness-at-ease. Key, perhaps, is that Crawford doesn’t play Frank’s wrongness; he plays his desperation to get things right. And with such a light touch! “He’s a strange mixture,” Crawford said of the character, “because he’s funny in what he says and how he behaves, but inside he’s boiling. He’s an incredibly sensitive soul. To play the part, you’ve got to know what it feels like when people say things that hurt.” And then there are the stunts – which is what most people remember of Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. Roller-skating under lorries, tumbling through a hotel room floor, and dangling from a Morris Minor as it teeters off a cliff. Famously, Crawford performed them all himself – and to Joe Pasquale’s credit, he does so too in the stage production, hurtling down a banister, legs akimbo, sending the spindles flying. However, casting a sexagenarian as Frank Spencer queers the pitch. Childlike innocence and ineptitude is one thing in a 30-year-old, quite another in a man twice his age. The stage show takes as its (tenuous) plot Betty’s announcement of her first pregnancy, and you can’t help noticing that the prospective dad is not far short of pensionable age. So is this still Frank Spencer? Not really; certainly not if you’ve been bingeing the original in advance. You could argue, I guess, that this is Pasquale’s interpretation of the character (more talkative, less tormented and vulnerable), in the same way actors interpret Hamlet. But Spencer isn’t Hamlet, and (with due respect to his fine scripts) writer Raymond Allen isn’t Shakespeare. Frank in the popular imagination is just the aggregate of the beautifully drawn traits Crawford brought to a familiar character type. Absent them, and you just get the type. Pasquale gives this lovable klutz persona a decent spin on stage. Susie Blake is on fun form as his mother-in-law – of course, there’s a mother-in-law – and there’s a showstopping set-piece at the end. But the humour on display (double entendres and dry-humping the vicar) is very old-fashioned: the stage show feels creakier and more out-of-its-time than the 1970s originals. As with The Good Life, I see no reason for this stage show to exist other than nostalgia, and theatres’ low confidence these days that they can fill their auditoria with anything original. But they do reconnect us with something special that happened in the past – in this case, an indelible comic turn by Crawford, with which I warmly recommend you (re)acquaint yourself.

4/12/2022,"Despite selling more than 21m cookery books, the TV chef Delia Smith was turned down by six publishers after serving up her latest book. But the mononymous Delia has said she was not surprised as she pivots her focus away from the kitchen to the human condition. Rather than guiding readers through the basics of baking, flop-proof soufflés and high-end home cuisine, she tackles the subject of spirituality with the aim of leading readers towards a more meaningful existence in You Matter: The Human Solution. The 80-year-old, a Christian who has been interested in spirituality for years, seemed sanguine about rejection before finding a publisher. She told the Radio Times: “I can’t say I’m that surprised. They might have thought it wasn’t going to sell very well.” But she was always “passionate” about the subject, and for some time had contemplated a book “about spirituality being natural”, she said. “It’s not something you acquire. It’s already there. And it just gets buried. There’s an inside life and an outside life, outside life tends to dominate, and inner life gets forgotten or suppressed.” The book includes insight from spiritual thinkers, philosophers, astronauts, poets and pop stars, including Pharrell Williams, who it transpires is one of her favourite musicians. Showing no sign of retirement, she fitted in her nine-to-five writing shifts around her other great passion – Norwich City FC – of which she is joint majority shareholder. She believes being surrounded by the club’s fans on match days is one of her secrets to remaining youthful. Her motivation for writing cookery books came from spotting a great need to try to teach people the basics. She continues this work on her website deliaonline.com, with almost 1,500 recipes for people to download. Now she hopes to help people fulfil their need to get in touch with their deeper selves and examine the reasons for human existence. As for her change in direction, she remains energised by the possibilities for change, especially on the political landscape. Having marched against Brexit, she is critical about the quality of leadership in the world, believing “we need some fresh new ideas on politics”.",Lifestyle/Food,Delia Smith says six publishers rejected her book on spirituality,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/12/delia-smith-says-six-publishers-rejected-her-book-on-spirituality
4/12/2022,"The rising price of food caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and increased energy costs could push a quarter of a billion more people into extreme poverty, Oxfam has warned. The charity said these new challenges had piled on to the economic crises created by Covid, and called for urgent international action, including cancelling debt repayments for poorer countries. “Without immediate radical action, we could be witnessing the most profound collapse of humanity into extreme poverty and suffering in memory,” said Oxfam’s international executive director, Gabriela Bucher. Oxfam’s briefing, released on Tuesday ahead of World Bank and IMF spring meetings next week, said indebted governments could be forced to cut public spending to meet the rising cost of importing fuel and food. Oxfam said cancelling debt repayments for this year and next could free up $30bn (£23bn) for dozens of the countries facing the biggest debts. The World Bank had already estimated that 198 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty this year as a result of the pandemic. But Oxfam estimates that 65 million more people are at risk if the invasion of Ukraine and rising energy prices are taken into account. It also estimates that 28 million more people will be left undernourished as a result. Oxfam called for more taxes on the wealthiest and also on companies that profit from crises such as the pandemic or the Ukraine war. It also called for the G20 to earmark $100bn of an existing austerity fund for poor countries to draw on, and protect the poorest from inflation through subsidies and cutting taxes on goods and services. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization reported last week that the war in Ukraine had made food commodities more expensive than ever, costing more than a third in March than at the same time last year. The Middle East and parts of Africa are expected to be particularly affected because of disrupted grain imports from the Black Sea region, which have compounded existing economic and climate crises. Oxfam said rising costs could see food account for 40% of incomes in sub-Saharan Africa. Bucher said lack of action from governments to tackle rising poverty was “inexcusable”. She said: “We reject any notion that governments do not have the money or means to lift all people out of poverty and hunger, and ensure their health and welfare. We only see the absence of economic imagination and political will to actually do so.”",News/Global development,"Quarter of a billion people now face extreme poverty, warns Oxfam",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/12/quarter-of-a-billion-people-now-face-extreme-poverty-warns-oxfam
4/12/2022,"More than a quarter of a billion people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty this year amid a surge in global food prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing impact of Covid and rising global inequality, Oxfam has warned. Highlighting the knock-on impact of the war for the poorest people around the globe, the aid charity said two decades of progress were in danger of being reversed as the conflict pushes up prices on wholesale markets, disrupts harvests and impedes exports of vital commodities. It warned a total of 263 million people – equivalent to the populations of the UK, France, Germany and Spain combined – could be pushed into extreme poverty this year. Ahead of key international meetings being held next week by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, Oxfam said that by the end of the year as many as 860 million people could be living in extreme poverty – living on less than $1.90 (£1.46) a day. The UN said last week that global food prices had reached a new all-time high amid the repercussions of war in Europe and warned that soaring costs would hit the poorest hardest. The conflict has driven up prices of wheat, maize and vegetable oils. Russia ranks as the world’s largest exporter of wheat, while Ukraine – known as the breadbasket of Europe – ranks fifth. Together the countries supply more than a quarter of global exports, with buyers typically concentrated in poor regions such as the Middle East and north Africa. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, which tracks global prices, said the war had contributed to a rise in cereal prices of 17% over the past month alone, with the closure of ports hitting wheat and maize exports in the Black Sea. Russian exports have also been slowed by financial and shipping problems. Oxfam said rising food costs account for 17% of consumer spending in wealthy countries, but as much as 40% in sub-Saharan Africa. The impact will also be felt in wealthier economies, including the US where the poorest fifth of families spend 27% of their income on food, compared with just 7% for the richest fifth. In a report titled First Crisis, then Catastrophe, it said a wave of governments in low-income countries were close to defaulting on their debts, and could be forced to cut public spending to pay creditors and import food and fuel. It found the world’s poorest countries are due to pay $43bn in debt repayments this year, which could otherwise cover the costs of their food imports. Oxfam said debt payments for developing countries could be cancelled to help those most at need, while an annual wealth tax on millionaires and billionaires could rake in more than $2.5tn a year. The proceeds could be used to lift 2.3 billion people out of poverty, make enough vaccines for the world, and deliver universal healthcare and social protection for everyone living in low and lower middle-income countries. Katy Chakrabortty, head of advocacy at Oxfam, said a “herculean response” was needed to tackle the catastrophe facing humanity from Covid and the impact of rising inflation fuelled by the war in Ukraine. “Multiple global crises are causing misery for millions of people and just moving aid around to each crisis is not enough; low-income countries need debt cancellation to be able to invest in social safety nets and progressive taxation on the wealthiest is needed now more than ever to provide huge funds for protecting the most vulnerable. “In addition to the shocking extreme poverty figures, millions of people are already experiencing severe levels of hunger across east and west Africa, Yemen and Syria.”",News/Business,More than 250m people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2022 – Oxfam,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/more-than-250m-people-could-be-pushed-into-extreme-poverty-in-2022-oxfam
4/12/2022,"Andrew Demetriou was at the vet, tending to his injured cat, when he phoned Gil McLachlan to congratulate him on becoming the new AFL CEO. They were two very different men. Demetriou came from humble stock. He was an old school bruiser. As the Essendon supplements scandal dragged on, he was increasingly irascible, and arguably out of his depth. His replacement would be more conciliatory, and a cooler head. Yes, he came from the polo set. But he understood grass roots football. He was willing to consult and listen. A canny negotiator, he was just the man to secure a monumental TV rights deal. No-one barracks for the AFL. They’re all too easy to bag, and to blame. Sometimes, we seem to expect more of them than our own elected officials. They’re invariably on a hiding to nothing. McLachlan certainly made his share of mistakes. He said as much at Tuesday’s press conference. He completely shilly-shallied throughout the Adam Goodes affair. On his watch, the AFL has had a desultory attitude to Tasmanian football. They continue to throw obscene amounts of money at the Gold Coast Suns. They still don’t seem completely sure of what do to with their women’s competition. And underpinning everything is the sense that the sport has been handed over to the host broadcasters. Indeed, at the announcement of the 2015 broadcast deal, on the same day James Hird was sacked as Essendon coach, McLachlan was flanked by Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Stokes. The AFL was now groaning with money. But at what cost? To his credit however, McLachlan worked hard to ensure football remained accessible to the average punter. Unlike his predecessor, he was always willing to engage with fans, to listen to their concerns and to make changes where necessary. He was always good at reading which way the wind was blowing. He would have been a fine politician. There was something disarming about him. He’d amble on to a show like AFL 360, field questions from a hyperventilating Mark Robinson, and be calm, coherent, and perfectly reasonable. Despite his corporate mumbo jumbo, the game was always foremost in his thinking. It’s why he baulked at the chance to become the CEO of the NRL. It would have been a chore. His heart lay with football. When he touched on that on Tuesday, his big eyes teared up. When league chair Richard Goyder was asked what McLachlan’s biggest asset was, he answered, “His ability to see around corners.” When you’re running a football competition, you really don’t know what any given day will bring. One minute you’re negotiating with Rupert Murdoch, and the next minute a player has set fire to the hired entertainment on Mad Monday. McLachlan took it all in his stride. But the way he responded to the pandemic will be his greatest legacy. The AFL’s ability to duck and weave, to keep Covid at arm’s length, to upend an entire competition at an hour’s notice, and to somehow produce a half-decent product, was remarkable. Adhering to Covid protocols, finding sterile corridors, chartering flights at $100,000 a pop, and whisking compromised players out as they warmed up – they did it all. But it took a toll. In 2020, he announced widespread job losses. All his staff gathered via webchat and the CEO addressed them from the front seat of his car. In the Gold Coast hub, a day after Richmond was embroiled in a kebab scandal, McLachlan had to give the various club leaders an almighty serve about the lack of adherence to Covid protocols. There were too many selfies, too much lounging by the pool, too much time at the bar. He was working 18-hour days, and the whole thing had worn him down. Indeed, he looked like a tired man on Tuesday. He was teary. He raced through his prepared statement. And he still has lots on his plate. He has collective bargaining agreements to negotiate with both the men and women. There’s another broadcast deal looming. Hopefully there’s some sort of resolution on a new Tasmanian team. When all that is done, Gil McLachlan will take a back seat. It’s reasonable to assume that life won’t be overly arduous. He’ll bob up at amateur football games at Melbourne University, with its white, picket fenced oval. He’ll perch down on the fence, with his form-guide and his pie, and his kids at his feet. When all the deals are done, and all the suits have left the building, the game itself is all that matters. McLachlan always understood that. It what brought him to tearsas he announced his impending departure.

4/12/2022,"Origin Energy says it will push ahead with gas exploration in the Beetaloo Basin after the Australian government cleared it of breaching sanctions against Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who has a stake in the project. The energy company’s position contrasts with that of miner Rio Tinto, which last week said that due to Australian and overseas sanctions it had taken full control of alumina refinery Queensland Alumina Limited, where another sanctioned oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, holds an interest. Australia slapped sanctions on Vekselberg and Deripaska last month after activists questioned why the two men were not on an earlier list when they were known to have interests in assets in the country. Vekselberg has a stake in Origin’s Beetaloo project through his 16% shareholding in Origin’s joint venture partner, the London-listed Falcon Oil & Gas. Origin said it had “received guidance from the Australian Sanctions Office (ASO) confirming that Origin’s exploration activities in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin do not breach Australian sanctions laws”. “The ASO’s assessment is that an asset is not currently being directly or indirectly made available to, or for the benefit of, Mr Vekselberg [as designated person] through the Beetaloo joint venture’s activities,” the company said. Origin’s head of integrated gas, Andrew Thornton, welcomed the assessment and said the company “will focus on completing our Beetaloo exploration program commitments by drilling and testing a further two wells”. “While no gas is currently being produced and no revenue is being generated, Origin will continue to exercise diligence in this matter, and seek further advice should joint venture structures change or should the project progress beyond exploration,” he said. “Origin remains committed to complying with Australian sanctions laws.” On Friday, Rio Tinto said it was taking full operational control of QAL “as a result of the Australian government’s sanction measures”. The refinery is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% by Rusal, Russia’s biggest aluminium producer. Rusal is in turn owned by En+ Group, where Deripaska has a 45% stake and Vekselberg is also a shareholder. Rio’s decision came despite assurances from En+ last month that Deripaska “cannot receive any type of financial benefit from his minority holding in En+, Rusal or any part of the group and is completely blocked from receiving dividends” as the result of a 2019 deal with US authorities under which the companies were released from sanctions and the oligarch reduced his shareholding to 45%.",News/Australia news,"Origin to push on with Beetaloo Basin plan, saying it didn’t breach sanctions against Russian oligarch",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/origin-to-push-on-with-beetaloo-basin-plan-saying-it-didnt-breach-sanctions-against-russian-oligarch

Although their ancestors were shy forest creatures, since the 19th century there has been widespread movement of blackbirds into cities. Their population densities are now higher in urban environments than in the countryside. Increased competition for territory rouses more urgent strains, but they can’t override the melody. Blackbird song has inspired writers, musicians and composers, and here in Belfast there is a long tradition of enthralment. The local poets Seamus Heaney and Ciaran Carson paid homage with translations of the ninth-century Irish poem The Blackbird of Belfast Lough. Farther afield, the Welsh poet-priest RS Thomas meditated on “a slow singer … loading each phrase / With history’s overtones, love, joy / And grief …” (A Blackbird Singing). And as he was dying, the Swedish writer Henning Mankell movingly declared: “I have heard the blackbird. I have lived.” Despite their song’s emotional resonance for us, blackbirds are, of course, singing for their own ends – any overtones of history are strictly theirs. The songs of species which evolved in forests often sound musical to our ears. Where a voice faces physical obstruction, such as branches and foliage, pure tones transmit more effectively. The blackbird’s gorgeous motif is an adaptation to that circumstance, to ensure his fluting announcement can be clearly heard beyond his territory’s boundary. I tune into the cadence of the nearest bird. At the end of each verse, his mellow notes segue to a more scratchy twitter. After the mellifluous opening, this refrain sounds oddly dissonant. Its higher pitch carries poorly over distance; and its complex modulations are easily distorted by bouncing off surfaces. However, in both art and evolution, form follows function. This twitter is deliberately intended for his more immediate surroundings, to either warn or wheedle. Any rustle in the understorey could be an appraising male – or a prospecting female. Minutes before sunrise, sparrows start gossiping. The blackbirds fade to silence. A starling sneers.
