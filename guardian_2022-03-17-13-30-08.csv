3/17/2022,"With a Bruno Fornaroli-shaped cat out of the bag and a World Cup on the line, Graham Arnold stated what seemed like the bleeding obvious but also happened to be true. “If you look at what Bruno Fornaroli’s done for Australian football as a foreigner over the last … seven to eight years, he’s always been consistently one of the best strikers in the league,” the Socceroos manager said. “With his goal-scoring ratio of a goal every two games, he brings great quality. But on top of that he brings a South American mentality, and that is fight ‘til you drop. He brings experience [and] because of that, these two games will not affect him at all.” The two games in question are against Japan and Saudi Arabia. They are games Australia must win, and the selection of Socceroo #617 carries a hint of desperate measures for desperate times. Fornaroli’s call-up is both a brilliant personal story and a dispiriting reflection of Australia’s paucity of depth. The two do not have to be mutually exclusive, though it feels incongruous nonetheless. In 2015, when he arrived in Australia, the little-known journeyman had long said goodbye to representing Uruguay at the senior level, having failed to progress from the under-17s. Even first-team football was hard to come by – over the course of some eight years he made little more than 120 appearances hopping around on loan from Sampdoria and then to Greece and back to South America. In the seven years since, Fornaroli has scored 81 goals from 138 games for Melbourne City and Perth Glory. He has become a cult hero to supporters of those clubs and even neutrals admiring his on-field zeal and off-field candour. In 2016 he skippered City to the FFA Cup trophy, won the Mark Viduka medal in the final and finished his victory speech by accidentally shouting “and fuck off” instead of “vamos”. The lost-in-translation moment encapsulates endearing qualities a country can get behind. On form alone, his selection also makes sense. While his scoring rate has slipped since his 25-goal golden boot season of 2015-16 for City, he still has seven from 14 games for Perth so far this campaign and, at two years older than teammate Daniel Sturridge, possesses a body in better nick. If a relatively sure thing in front of goal is available, why not use him? Arnold is under pressure. He knows the Socceroos must beat both Japan and Saudi Arabia to qualify directly for Qatar 2022 or be slung straight into the Asian and intercontinental play-offs. The manager will be without a number of regular attackers for this critical window, with Riley McGree, Adam Taggart and Nikita Rukavytsya to miss both games and Jamie Maclaren only available for the Japan fixture before leaving camp to get married. The obvious caveat is that Australia’s national team should not find itself in the position of needing to cap a 34-year-old, especially at this stage of a World Cup cycle. In essence, the decision – while arguable the correct one – constitutes another stop-gap to paper over a much deeper crack. The player-production-line narrative is a path well-trodden in this country, where player development pathways have been blocked by lack of appropriate infrastructure, or money, or pure ineptitude mired in petty politics. As Ange Posecoglou said last month: “The signs have been there for a while that the rest of Asia is improving and we’ve kind of stalled in our development.” Two years ago Viduka was also worried, lamenting “there’s a big gap in terms of player development, I think that’s a big problem – I think we’re not producing players like we used to”. The concerns stretch further back in time than this, and yet the same problems present themselves each window when one position or another is rendered bereft by the absence of one or two key players. Compounding the issue is a tendency by A-League Men clubs to sign imports as their starting forwards, leaving few opportunities for locals to break through. The swift rise of Alou Kuol at the Central Coast Mariners en route to VfB Stuttgart was a welcome antidote. Still, foreign-born players can be a valuable asset. Scotland-born pair Harry Souttar and Martin Boyle have excelled in green and gold, albeit at the ages of 23 and 28 respectively. Fornaroli for the Socceroos could be a stroke of genius. If the team end up in a Conmebol play-off against Uruguay – a not-impossible prospect – it could make for an intriguing conflict of interest. And if this naturalised Australian conjures something from nothing over the next two weeks, as he is inclined to do, he may save his new nation from the embarrassment of missing a World Cup for the first time in 16 years.",Sport/Football,Bruno Fornaroli for the Socceroos: stroke of genius or stop gap to paper over cracks? | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/bruno-fornaroli-for-the-socceroos-stroke-of-genius-or-stop-gap-to-paper-over-cracks
3/17/2022,"As Vladimir Putin was preparing to send troops into Ukraine last month, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, warned the UK “will open up the matryoshka dolls of Russian-owned companies and Russian-owned entities to find the ultimate beneficiaries within.” Johnson’s reflex was spot on, albeit overdue. Anti-corruption advocates have been calling for such measures for years. To disempower autocrats, kleptocratic wealth must be controlled. Today, though, corrupt money finds a haven in strong rule-of-law countries. Kleptocrats believe these places will protect their assets, just as the law protects other assets. Sadly, they’ve been right, at least until now. Putin’s war has seen sanctions levelled against him and his elite supporters on both sides of the Atlantic. “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” vowed US president Biden about Russia’s oligarchs in his State of the Union address. “We’re joining with European Allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets.” The amount of wealth held offshore by rich Russians is huge, about equal to the wealth of the entire population inside the country. Transatlantic cooperation will be reinforced by a Task Force KleptoCapture in Washington and a Kleptocracy Cell in London. As part of the global effort, Australia has imposed sanctions on over 460 people and entities. And it has joined the US, Europeans, Canada and Japan in a Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) multilateral task force. But there’s a snag in all this: you can’t sanction what you can’t see. The assets of corrupt elites are largely hidden behind opaque legal structures – the anonymous shell companies and secretive trusts that are the beating heart of an offshore financial system which has been thriving for decades. Lawyers and other professionals in tax havens and financial centres have willingly supplied the corporate veil corrupt elites use to hide their assets. The fight against ill-gotten wealth, from Russia and elsewhere, has to be a fight against financial anonymity. Coupled with its sanctions, Australia should join with others in dismantling the rules and practices that have allowed corrupt elites to shelter their wealth across borders, including in Australia and other liberal democracies. Corrupt wealth finds its way here from countries in our region and beyond. Structural reform and a shift in mindset is needed to systematically reveal and deter these financial flows which exploit our open markets. Globally, the tragedy of Ukraine could mark a turning point in unmaking the infrastructure of offshore wealth that has emboldened tyrants, fuelled oppression and entrenched poverty in many societies. Moves by Washington, Brussels, and London in recent days to crack down on corrupt Russian wealth could be midwife to much-needed action to temper illicit finance more broadly. Australia should play a constructive role in this project. But it does not have a register to ensure regulatory and law enforcement authorities – and the public – know who truly owns and controls Australian companies. The government has previously signalled a commitment to this reform, including to comply with multilateral standards. As assistant treasurer in 2016, Kelly O’Dwyer said a register would make it “a lot easier to expose wrongdoing or fraudulent conduct” and “much easier to disrupt illicit financial flows”. But momentum in Canberra has stalled, even as key partners like the US, UK, and Canada have converged on the importance of this move. The Biden administration is pushing ahead plans to implement the bipartisan Corporate Transparency Act. His Treasury’s proposed register has been widely welcomed – and not just from activists and law enforcement. BHP, the mining giant, said it “presents a real opportunity to not only reduce illicit fund flows into the U.S., but to also send important signals on the need to tackle global corruption”. The UK is starting to close loopholes which have undermined its register, Companies House, with reforms aiming to make the agency “a custodian of accurate and detailed information”. There’s much at stake, even beyond geopolitics. Ownership transparency is linked to a fundamental governance question of our time: how to build productive and equitable markets in a globalised world. Progress on transparency would signal the kind of economy we want in Australia: inclusive, well-governed, fair, and oriented towards innovation and productive investment rather than rent-seeking. In other words, wealth creation for the many rather than rigged returns for the few. Led by the Treasurer, the government can take three steps to embrace this world-making moment. First, it should legislate a world-leading, public, beneficial ownership register. There should be robust verification procedures and powers to trace complex ownership claims. Australia can also reduce or eliminate the percentage threshold which defines beneficial ownership, ensuring it can’t be gamed. Second, agencies should be properly resourced to use the new register to deter and seize corrupt wealth. Enforcement is key. Agencies such as Austrac and the AFP must have capabilities to actually use the new register, including through dedicated anti-corruption expertise. Finally, it is crucial that regulatory and law enforcement agencies receive a clear and strong political mandate to prioritise their anti-corruption work. Building on current sentiments at home and abroad, Canberra will have to muster the will to systematically fight transnational corruption, alongside investing in the instruments to do so, elevating it to a top-tier priority. Much more needs to be done, including to trace the owners of real estate and luxury assets, and to require more transparency of foreign investors. But an effective register for Australian entities is necessary and would make a substantive international contribution. Corrupt networks and the autocrats they empower are bringing countries – and regions – to their knees. The harms inflicted on Ukraine today call on us to recommit to a better global order, one that permits citizens to organise themselves as free peoples, without internal or external domination. Australia should seize the moment, and demonstrate that we not only get the kleptocracy problem, but that we’re serious about confronting it.

3/17/2022,"“It’s good to be alive,” artist Sallie Culy says as she finishes a ham and cheese sandwich at one of the many cafes she visits most days in Wellington. “It really is good to be alive.” Sallie’s words, like much of how she interacts with the world, are life-affirming. As a person, and as an artist, she celebrates connection, imagination, joy and the daily interactions that make life shimmer. Her approach is a welcome reprieve at a time when the world grapples with tragedy, and the city Sallie loves – Wellington - is still catching its breath after a weeks-long protest that ended with parliament’s grounds burning. Sallie, who was born with Williams Syndrome – a rare genetic condition that causes developmental and learning disabilities – has become a familiar face to Wellingtonians. As the title of her first ever public art exhibition suggests – ‘Hello to Everybody’- Sallie is one of the friendliest people in the city. “I love the people saying ‘hi’ and ‘hello’,” she says of the wide community she has created for herself. Sallie leads a relatively independent life, and when she isn’t volunteering at the Wellington City Mission and the Holy Cross School in Miramar, singing in the Wellington Community Choir or chatting to her wide array of friends in the capital’s shops and cafes, she is making art. Just around the corner from the cafe, on Courtenay Place, one of the city’s main strips, are a series of light boxes nearly a storey high. Displayed within them are Sallie’s works – felt-pen and crayon drawings featuring brightly coloured flowers, cats with attitude, skaters in orange tracksuits, pop-stars such as Rhianna, platters of food, and depictions of friends and family. The drawings are bold, playful, and an utterly joyful homage to the city she has called home for her 41 years. “It’s just love and it’s hopes and dreams for other people because they are trying not to struggle,” Sallie says of her work. The revolving light box exhibitions have been a part of Wellington’s public art programme since 2008 and Sallie is the first artist with an intellectual disability to have her work exhibited there. “But we’re sure Sallie won’t be the last,” said Eve Armstrong, the council’s senior arts adviser. Sallie has enjoyed drawing since she was a child, but has had no formal artistic training. Five years ago, she started visiting her brother – award-winning photographer Harry Culy - for weekly drawing sessions, and built up a large portfolio of work. Harry and Sallie then contacted Wellington city council with an exhibition proposal. “This exhibition in a larger way may be a public forum for the often overlooked unique talents that can be found in people with disabilities,” the proposal read. On receiving the proposal, Armstrong said: “It was engaging and joyful, and we felt Sallie’s drawings and perspective on life in Pōneke [Wellington city] would spark interest and conversation among audiences”. The response to the exhibition has been beyond what she could have imagined. “So many people have felt a personal connection to the show through knowing Sallie and having seen her around the city over the years.” “One of the most moving experiences I have heard is of a group of students visiting the light boxes exhibition, as they recognised Sallie from the media but also had a student at their school with Williams Syndrome.” It is incredibly difficult for people with disabilities to get into art spaces, says Harry, who as a photographer, understands the art world. “There has been a lot of exclusion in past in those spaces – giving more diverse voices to that space is really important.” Sallie, who is “really honoured and really proud” with the exhibition hopes that displaying work of an artist with a disability will foster connection and understanding between people: “because if people understand me, I can understand them – you know, we can just sit down and learn to bond”.",News/World news,‘It’s good to be alive’: groundbreaking New Zealand artist brings light and joy to city streets,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/its-good-to-be-alive-groundbreaking-new-zealand-artist-brings-light-and-joy-to-city-streets
3/17/2022,"A six-year ordeal for the British-Iranian prisoners Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori has finally ended after they were released by Iran and freed to return home to be reunited with their families. A third dual national accused of spying, the businessman and wildlife conservationist Morad Tahbaz, was freed from prison on furlough, but his family said he feels abandoned in Iran by the British government. News of the two detainees’ release, the subject of months-long behind-the-scenes diplomacy and payment of a £400m debt, was formally announced by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, and Ashoori, 67, were released from the control of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps just before noon UK time at Tehran international airport before being flown to Oman and then on to an RAF base, where they are to be greeted by their relatives and Truss. Nazanin’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, standing beside their smiling seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella, said he was looking forward to becoming a normal family again. His wife’s greatest ambition after a period of recuperation was to sit down on the sofa, make a cup of tea and just be in the living room together, he said, adding: “Homecoming is a journey and not an arrival.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in 2016 in Tehran after working as a charity project manager. Ashoori, a retired civil engineer, was in prison for almost five years, while Tahbaz has been held for four. All three denied charges of spying. Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Truss said their release was “the result of years of tenacious British diplomacy”. The UK finally struck the deal after the paying a decades-old debt via a Swiss humanitarian channel. Britain says it has guarantees that the money will be used only for food and medical purposes. It's been 6 long years - and I can't believe I can FINALLY share this photo.Nazanin is now in the air flying away from 6 years of hell in Iran.My heart goes out to Gabriella and Richard, as her long journey back home to them gets closer by the minute.#NazaninIsFree ❤️ pic.twitter.com/BzEEBP840C In a dramatic day of tense emotions, Iranian state media reported that Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori had been handed over to a British team on Wednesday but a two-hour delay at Tehran’s airport suggested a last-minute hitch, largely over the fate of Tahbaz. Iran is treating Tabhaz, 66, as an American citizen, even though he was born in Hammersmith, west London, and holds US, UK and Iranian citizenship. Disagreements over his fate proved an obstacle to a deal in the past. The Tahbaz family told the Guardian: “We have been let down and betrayed by the British government. He was the only one of the three with a British birth certificate, and he has been left behind. We were not told about this arrangement except in a short phone call with the foreign secretary, when it was too late to do anything about it. The British now just say he is an American problem.” Truss said the UK would “continue to push with partners” to secure Tahbaz’s “long overdue” release home. She praised the resolve and courage shown by the detainees and their families. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, criticised Boris Johnson as he praised Truss, telling MPs: “She showed more skills in diplomacy than her bungling boss.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s MP, Tulip Sidiq, welcomed her home. “Can I say to Nazanin: welcome home after six long years. And can I say to Gabriella: this time mummy is really coming home.” Paying tribute to Richard Ratcliffe, who undertook a 21-day hunger strike last year, she said: “He has really set the bar high for husbands.” The former prime minister David Cameron, who was in No 10 when Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran, told Channel 4 News her release was “a piece of good news that we’ve all been waiting to hear for so long”. The UK is understood to have agreed to pay £393.8m owed to Iran after it cancelled an order of Chieftain tanks following the overthrow of the Shah in the revolution of 1979. The details of the deal were hammered out in secret talks in February largely in Oman between a British Foreign Office team and the Iranians. With trust between the two countries at a low point, every aspect of the deal, including its choreography, had to be agreed. The UK acknowledged the Iranian claim on the money was legitimate but payment was held up over Britain’s ability to make it without breaching US sanctions, leading to the money being frozen by the US. The UK had examined many times whether the payment could be made through a humanitarian channel in Switzerland or even in the form of medicines. It was not clear to what extent the US had endorsed the British bilateral deal, but a US Congressman, Jim Himes, claimed Truss may have gone back on assurances that she had given to him personally that Tahbaz would be included. Truss hinted that the UK was negotiating solely on behalf of its own three detainees, and not part of a wider package involving American detainees. She told the BBC: “I have to act in the UK national interest. I have to protect British citizens, and my priority is returning our detainees.” It is also too early to say if the deal will mark a new diplomatic era between the UK and Iran, and that may yet depend on whether Iran and the west can agree terms for the US and Iran to come back into compliance with the original 2015 nuclear deal – something that is likely to be decided in the next fortnight. The British deal will put pressure on other countries with dual nationals held in jail. The UK is not the only signatory to the joint comprehensive plan of action – as the 2015 nuclear deal is known – to have detainees held in Iran. The four Americans most frequently mentioned as US priorities for release are Tahbaz, Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi and Emad Sharqi. The US special envoy for Iran, Rob Malley, has never explicitly made an agreement to lift US sanctions and rejoin the nuclear deal contingent on the release of US hostages, but has said he cannot conceive of circumstances in which the sanctions would be lifted and the US detainees remained in an Iranian jail. The French priority for release is the Franco-Iranian anthropologist and dual national Fariba Adelkhah, detained since June 2019. She was given a five-year jail sentence in 2020, allowed out with an electronic bracelet in October 2020, then re-imprisoned in January 2021. Germany is seeking the release of Nahid Taghavi, a German-Iranian dual national arrested in October 2020 by Iranian intelligence and sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison. Mariam Claren, her daughter, said: “My question as a German citizen is, if there is a deal and you’re going to sign it and if the US hostages are going to be freed, what is your answer for us other families – are you going to leave our family members behind?”",News/News,Free at last: Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori head back to UK after six-year ordeal,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/16/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-to-leave-iran-after-six-years-in-detention-reports
