4/7/2022,"Boris Johnson’s energy security plan has been dismissed as a missed opportunity to bring down bills rapidly, over its failure to fund energy efficiency upgrades or back onshore windfarms in the face of Tory backbench opposition. While the government’s plans set targets for long-term expansion of nuclear, offshore wind and solar capacity, it stopped short of doing so for onshore wind. The proposals also lacked a major intervention to help households lower their gas usage by improving insulation standards. The shadow business and energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said Johnson had been “held to ransom” by backbench opposition to windfarms. Energy experts and environmental groups labelled the plan “inadequate”, warning it would to little to address the urgent need to tackle sky-high bills and reduce dependence on gas imports, including from Russia. The strategy did set ambitious targets for offshore wind generation, with the government raising its target from 40 to 50 gigawatts by 2030 But Johnson did not back a wind industry proposal to double onshore capacity to 30GW over the same period. Executives are understood to have told the prime minister during a meeting last week that onshore turbines offered the cheapest and fastest way to wean the UK off gas, the price of which has rocketed further amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the government backed away from setting targets for onshore, after fierce opposition from senior Tories including the chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who called the turbines an “eyesore”. Instead, the government promised to offer a “limited” number of communities guaranteed lower electricity bills in exchange for supporting local windfarms. Miliband said this would do little to unblock planning restrictions that he said place a “unique burden” on onshore wind, which he claimed could have replaced Russian gas imports within 24 months. Under a moratorium implemented by David Cameron’s government in 2015, onshore windfarms in England require unanimous consent from local communities, meaning they can easily be blocked. “If one person objects, it doesn’t get built,” Miliband told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that it was easier to build an incinerator or a road in the face of local opposition. “The government has rejected the cheapest, lowest cost, most secure forms of power we have […] including onshore wind.” Mark Worcester, of the planning consultancy Turley, said: “Some of the more immediate opportunities appear to have been missed.” Once an onshore windfarm has secure a contract to supply energy, it can be fully operational within about two years, compared with four or five for offshore projects, according to th trade body RenewableUK. Electricity from onshore wind is also about 20% cheaper than offshore, which is in turn cheaper than nuclear or gas. Miliband accused the government of shying away from onshore “not because of the national interest but because some Tory backbenchers said they didn’t want it to happen”. The energy security plan also came in for criticism for failing to map out a return to nationwide home energy efficiency upgrades, which have dwindled dramatically over the past decade. Since 2013, successive government cuts to support for insulation have reduced the number of installations from 2.3m to 10% of that number, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, an independent advisory organisation. But the energy security plan contained no new measures to accelerate efficiency efforts, amid a row over cost between the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). One Whitehall source said the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, had been keen to use about £300m in departmental underspend from the past few years to kickstart a programme of mass home insulations. But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with whom Kwarteng has previously clashed over financial support for businesses, is understood to have preferred not to commit funding to the plan. Robert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, said the government had not “taken the opportunity to promote demand-side energy efficiency, including via insulation – which in turn will help reduce the most significant costs and support the push for net zero.” Greenpeace said the plans were “completely inadequate”, while the Association for Renewable Energy & Clean Technology said the government had “failed to rise to the challenge facing the country”.",News/Business,UK energy security plan criticised as missed chance to reduce bills,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/uk-energy-security-plan-criticised-missed-chance-bills-onshore-wind
4/7/2022,"Ever since Sunset Boulevard’s dead protagonist floated into view in the iconic opening sequence of Billy Wilder’s 1950 film, a drama set in a Los Angeles suburb with a swimming pool as its central feature has carried ominous connotations. Daddy’s heated pool is set within a contemporary Bel Air mansion, and is modelled on David Hockney’s swimming pool paintings of the 1960s and 70s. It colonises most of the stage. But the play’s protagonist is very much alive, erupting out of the water in Speedos in the opening scene. This is a sign to expect the unexpected in this bold, brawny, flamboyantly theatrical production written by Jeremy O Harris and first staged off Broadway in 2019. It features an unequal relationship between Franklin (Terique Jarrett), a young Black American artist, and Andre (Claes Bang) an older, white, billionaire art collector who becomes his lover, and whose nickname, “Daddy”, is taken from a moment of sexual role play. Their alliance is queasy from the start, with flecks of Death in Venice but with race, money and art patronage added to the mix; the question of who is exploiting whom hangs indeterminately between them. Throw in Franklin’s churchgoing, gospel-singing moralist mother (Sharlene Whyte) and a mischievous choir (Rebecca Bernice Amissah, Keisha Atwell, T’Shan Williams, all three fabulous) that pops up to heighten the mood and we get the melodrama of the play’s subtitle. The mood is impish and knowing with cool disco beats, sudden spotlights, and a hammy rendition of George Michael’s Father Figure. But for all the theatrics, there is enough sophistication in the writing and in Danya Taymor’s direction for these elements to work to thrilling effect. The short first half brings sharp art world satire through Franklin’s gallerist (Jenny Rainsford), who is at pains to market him to wealthy white clients in exactly the right way. Franklin’s friends, meanwhile, always featured poolside, bring teen-movie satire: Bellamy (Ioanna Kimbrook) is an Insta addict in skimpy swimwear while Max (John McCrea) is a snarky geek who together make an entertainingly vapid double act. There are deadly serious issues at play: Andre regards his lover as he might an objet d’art, to be gazed at and admired. There is not only exoticisation (“chocolate” skin is mentioned) but ownership, too (“You are mine”), and Franklin’s body is always on show, barely clad for the duration of the play. Andre’s white gaze extends to Franklin’s art work; Jean-Michel Basquiat is mentioned at the start, as well as the question of how the value of artwork changes when it is brought into a gallery. Franklin first creates miniature black dolls and then lifesize figures, all of which are sold to rich white celebrity types, as his mother observes. Complicated questions arise out of his art-making: how is blackness packaged and sold in America’s contemporary art market? How does this art world view work made by a queer black artist? And is Franklin colluding in this process for his own gain? A sensational first half hooks us into every last intrigue and all the actors work wonders: Bang, as Andre, has a raffish, Rupert Everett look and gives off a buzzing sense of predation. Jarrett is exquisite as Franklin, balancing innocence with knowing and trauma with playfulness. Whyte’s mother is a baroque creation, both funny and alarming – a preacher in disguise, belting out her moral warnings against her son’s sinful living in song. She turns darker in the second half, and every other character feels skewed so that the drama becomes more feverish and surreal. This longer second part is less masterful than the first. The story seems to dismantle itself but to throw out too many things at once, without following them through deeply. Oedipal strains are felt and buried trauma unearthed in Franklin’s memories of his real, abandoning “daddy”. The play moves into the territory of psychodrama and becomes opaque, locking us out with unexpected turns rather than carry us with it, as the first half has done. But in spite of these frustrations, Daddy never ceases to be interesting. And if there was ever a play wholly worth watching for its perfectly formed first half, this is it. Daddy is at the Almeida theatre, London, until 30 April.",Arts/Stage,"Daddy: A Melodrama review – Black art, white money and love in Speedos",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/07/daddy-a-melodrama-review-black-art-white-money-almeida-london
4/7/2022,"David McKee, the author and illustrator of the iconic children’s books Elmer, Not Now, Bernard and Mr Benn, has died aged 87, his publisher has said. The author and illustrator died surrounded by family in the south of France following a short illness. After a lifetime of travelling the world, he and his partner Bakhta, a French-Algerian art dealer, had been dividing their time between London and Provence in recent years. His long time publisher Klaus Flugge said he was devastated by the news. “His was a singular voice and a shining light in children’s books that highlighted inclusivity, diversity and parts of our world that are not always present in publishing for children.” He added: “Not only was I fortunate to be his publisher, he was also a wonderful friend, and he will be missed by many more people than he could ever imagine.” McKee was born in Tavistock, Devon, and studied at Plymouth Art College. His first book Two Can Toucan was published in 1964 by Flugge when he worked at Abelard-Schuman. When Flugge founded Andersen Press in 1976, McKee moved with him and went on to create more than 50 books for the publisher. McKee wrote and illustrated 29 original stories about the beloved multi-coloured patchwork elephant Elmer, the first of which was published in 1968. The books remain one of the most widely read children’s book series of all time: more than 10m copies have been sold, and they have been translated into more than 60 languages. The themes of inclusivity, celebration and friendship that run through the Elmer stories led the Guardian to hail Elmer as an LGBT hero in 2014. “I never intended to do that,” McKee said in an interview at the time, “but I suspect there are subconscious processes at work I only discover later.” As well as writing and illustrating children’s books, McKee had a successful career as a fine artist, and as a co-creator of animated TV programmes including Mr Benn, based on his series of books about an explorer’s magical adventures. The series celebrated its 50th anniversary last year. McKee was named the BookTrust Lifetime Achievement award winner in 2020. “David McKee understands the importance of always paying attention to children and what he gives them is first-rate,” said chair of judges Nicolette Jones when announcing his win. Speaking to the Guardian in 2020, McKee said: “I’ve often said I think the air is full of stories – you just have to have the right receiver and you pick them up.”",Arts/Books,Elmer and Mr Benn author David McKee dies at 87,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/07/elmer-and-mr-benn-author-david-mckee-dies-at-87
4/7/2022,"On Tuesday, Oklahoma became the latest state to pass a bill to make performing an abortion a felony, punishable, in this case, by 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine. The bill is expected to be signed into law by the governor, creating an even larger group of people – about 7.7 million between Texas and Oklahoma – who will have to leave their home state if they want an abortion. Republican legislators are passing restrictions and bans on abortion, in expectation of a supreme court decision in a crucial abortion rights case expected in June. Until then, abortion remains legal, albeit severely restricted in some cases, across the US. There was some hope that medication abortions might help alleviate this pressure. In July 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that anyone seeking a medication abortion – that is, an abortion by taking pills, up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, without the need for an operation – would no longer have to pick up the medication in person, or take it in a doctor’s presence. Its decision to stop enforcing in-person requirements for the abortion drug mifepristone was a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, but in December, in consensus with the medical community, it ended the requirement for good. Mifepristone, which data shows is safer than acetaminophen, is now available for US patients to acquire via telehealth services like Abortion on Demand and Just The Pill, which offer online appointments and discreet mail order medications. Consultations and ordering are straightforward and user-friendly on these sites and pills are posted in less than five days. People may take it without a provider’s oversight in the comfort and privacy of their own homes, just as they did after obtaining it in-person from a doctor. The FDA’s decision empowered a wave of certified virtual clinics. In the coming months, the FDA is expected to clarify how pharmacies, like Walgreens and CVS, can distribute mifepristone for the first time. The increased accessibility of abortion medication is a huge asset to people living in states that permit it – in fact, medication abortion accounted for 54% of all US abortions in 2020, up from 39% in 2017, according to research from the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute. “We were overjoyed [at the FDA’s decision], because over the years we’ve been building evidence that continues to show that people who want to use [mifepristone] to end their pregnancy … they are very capable of being able to read the instructions and do so on their own,” says Liza Fuentes, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute. However, 19 states currently have laws requiring an in-person element to abortions, such as an ultrasound or an in-person counseling session, precluding a totally virtual experience. And some states, including Texas, Arizona, and Louisiana ban abortion telehealth services outright. For those seeking an abortion in states where it is restricted, acquiring abortion pills through the mail is a much quicker and more affordable option than having to travel across state lines for an in-person appointment. Already, says Rachel Rebouché, interim dean of Temple University’s law school, people seeking medication abortions can use social media to find advice on how to change their VPNs, have pills illicitly mailed to a FedEx drop-off point in a neighboring state, or how to have pills sent to someone else who can deliver them. But Republicans are aggressively restricting access to telehealth care for abortions in red states, with many creating trigger laws aimed at banning or severely restricting abortion across the board should Roe v Wade be overturned. And while some states have interstate agreements allowing healthcare providers to offer telehealth services across borders, providers are beholden to the laws of the patient’s home state, preventing blue state doctors from mailing abortion medication to red state patients. Republicans are also attempting to amend anti-abortion bills further to prevent red state residents from getting abortions regardless of where the abortion takes place – even if they travel to a blue state to access in-person or telehealth care. Even if, for instance, a resident of an anti-abortion state traveled to California, these laws would see that their body remained under the jurisdiction of their home state. Some red states could likely already prosecute under existing accomplice and conspiracy laws. “You see states like Missouri trying to attach its laws to providers who are providing abortions outside of Missouri, but trying to think about how to civilly penalize those providers by saying ‘any provider who provides an abortion to a Missouri resident is bound by the laws of Missouri,’” says Rebouché. Experts anticipate the brunt of aggressive anti-abortion enforcement will be disproportionately borne by those with few resources – people of color, low-income families, and the young. Blue states are working to enshrine abortion rights within and beyond their borders, with some refusing to accept that state legislatures can impinge on the sovereignty of other states by enforcing laws beyond their own jurisdictions. California and Connecticut are both actively advancing abortion rights, working to shield “providers from legal liability and prevent them from being extradited” and by creating networks for travel for abortion and centers for abortion care, says Rebouché. “The inevitable reality is that even though there is legal liability at stake, mailing abortion medication and administering those pills at home can be really hard to detect,” she adds. “Some states will try to enforce [abortion bans] but others will not because it won’t be worth the cost and it’s going to be difficult to do.”",News/US news,Mail-order abortion pills become next US reproductive rights battleground,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/us-mail-order-abortions-oklahoma
4/7/2022,"Carried his rider into the history books 12 months ago as a flawless, ground-saving ride by Rachael Blackmore kept him out of trouble and in the right place to strike for home two out. A similar no-nonsense performance in the saddle can be expected but he is 15lb higher in the ratings and it is nearly half a century since Red Rum became the last top weight to win. Repeat wins in the National are extremely rare for a reason – all the stars need to align just to win once –, never mind with more lead in the saddle. A gallant run into fifth or sixth is probably a more plausible outcome. The party-pooper at last month’s Cheltenham Festival, when loud boos rang out from the grandstands after he denied the legendary Tiger Roll victory on his final start. He would be a very popular winner at Aintree, though. The adaptability required to win on his first start over the cross-country obstacles felt like the final piece of the puzzle ahead of his Grand National debut, and he has been attracting plenty of support ever since. With five Grade One chase wins on his record, he also has the class to go with his stamina, but this latest challenge comes just 24 days after his huge effort at Cheltenham. With the juice squeezed out of his price, a couple of the fresher horses are marginally preferred. It looked like a long-term plan was afoot when this cross-country race specialist – an easy winner at Cheltenham in March 2020 – joined Jonjo O’Neill from David Cottin’s French stable at the end of last season. If plot there was, however, three Ps on his record indicating he has been pulled-up three times since suggest that it has gone somewhat awry. He showed a little more of his old sparkle before dropping away tamely behind Delta Work in the Cross Country Chase last month, but he is still weighted up to his best and he has a huge amount to find on this season’s form to get anywhere near the frame. Every Grand National has a hard luck story or three, but few match this one’s tale of woe 12 months ago. Ted Walsh’s runner was travelling sweetly, not far off the lead, when he was stopped in his tracks by a faller at the 12th, losing at least a dozen lengths. Mark Walsh worked his way back into contention two out and was still disputing second at the Elbow, a remarkable effort in the circumstances. He is 7lb higher in the ratings this year, which is more than fair on his 2021 form, and has been freshened up since winning a Grade Three in February. With a bit more luck, he will be very tough to keep out of the frame. There are faint echoes of Rule The World, the 2016 Grand National winner, about this Gordon Elliott-trained eight-year-old, a second-season novice with high-class form over fences but only one chase win to his name as yet. Rule The World, in fact, had not even managed that when he came home in front six years ago, and Run Wild Fred made it plain that stamina will not be an issue when he finished second in the National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham last time. He did not look like a horse with an abundance of gears there, however, and it will be a surprise if a few nippier types do not have the beating of him. Looked likely to be a force in the very best races for years to come when he landed the Grade One Betfair Chase in November 2019, but has only one win in 10 starts since. On the plus side, one of those defeats was a close third in the 2020 Gold Cup, and he ran well under a big weight at Cheltenham last month, finishing eighth in the Ultima Handicap Chase. That still gives him something to find under another hefty burden here, however, and the top 10 is probably as good as it is likely to get. Some National runners tick all the right boxes. This one ticks several of the wrong ones, in particular a habit of throwing in a sloppy jump or three in most races. It surfaced again in the Cross Country Chase last month – which looks like one of the key pieces of form for this year’s race – as he unseated his jockey. The Aintree fences are not quite what they were, but clouting one or more can still be enough to cost you any chance of a win, and this one is likely to be back among the also-rans. Going as well as the winner three from home last year but failed to see it out, eventually finishing 27 lengths behind Minella Times. His finishing effort was also disappointing in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February, form which gives him little chance of beating either Any Second Now or Escaria Ten. While Willie Mullins sees him as his No 1 contender, that probably says more about the relative weakness of his team this year. Another member of Gordon Elliott’s eight-strong stable , but one of the least convincing candidates to give her trainer a record-equalling fourth success. Stamina is unlikely to be an issue – she has looked to be crying out for a test like this for much of her career – but her jumping is generally so-so at best and comes with a tendency to veer sharply right. On a left-handed track like Aintree, that could cost her many lengths, and her latest run in the new Mares’ Chase at Cheltenham was a let-down too. Easily overlooked. Martin Brassil hit the bullseye with Numbersixvalverde, his first Grand National runner, in 2006, saddled the same horse to finish sixth a year later and then sent Double Seven to finish third in 2014. This is his first National runner since and won the ultra-competitive Thyestes Chase – a race that Numbersixvalverde landed the season before his Aintree win – in January, with several of today’s opponents well beaten. As an eight-year-old making just his seventh chase start, he has more scope for improvement than most and at around 16-1, is an excellent bet to further improve Brassil’s excellent record in the world’s most famous steeplechase. A live candidate to be the best of the British-trained runners in this year’s race, but even that would be no guarantee of an each-way return given the strength of the Irish challenge. The eight-year-old’s domestic form is rock-solid, however, and Colin Tizzard also resisted the urge to run him at Cheltenham, despite an excellent run in the Ladbrokes Trophy in November which could have persuaded him to aim at the Gold Cup. A sound jumper who goes on any ground, though his stamina is untested at a marathon trip and more dependable stayers can be backed at much the same price. Beaten less than two lengths in a Grade One race at Ascot last time, which is strong form for a horse getting weight from several of the major fancies. That was over two miles and five furlongs, however, and in addition to the question mark over his stamina, the fact that he fell on his first attempt over these fences – in the Topham Trophy last season – is another concern. Kim Bailey, his trainer, knows what it takes to win this, having saddled Mr Frisk in 1990, but on balance, a price of around 40-1 looks fair. A top-class chaser at his best, who went down by just a neck in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March 2020. If he has been on the downslope of his career since, it has been a fairly gentle one thus far. A change of scenery may have helped, having switched from Nicky Henderson to Polly Gundry over the summer, and he was up with the leaders for much of the way in last month’s renewal. One of several who could show up well for a long way if the fences fire him up, while unlikely to maintain his challenge beyond the second-last. Lauded by some as a potential all-time great when he ran up a sequence of wins as a novice hurdler in 2017/18, though Michael O’Leary, his owner, said at the time that “he will never be as good as the hype will make out”. The 10-year-old has had his moments, including three Grade One wins and as Gordon Elliott points out, it “would be a Samcro thing to do” to “run a massive race” on Saturday, but it would be a Samcro thing to finish 16th too – as he did on his first start in a handicap chase – and that is the more credible scenario. Closely matched with Any Second Now on their form in the Bobbyjo Chase in February, when last year’s third gave 8lb to Gordon Elliott’s eight-year-old – 1lb more than he will on Saturday – and edged him by a nose. The time of that race was notably strong too, and a real step forward from Escaria Ten’s comeback run behind Longhouse Poet in the Thyestes Chase. He was probably feeling the effects of a big effort at Cheltenham when pulled up in last year’s Irish National in April 2021 and definitely makes the short list Owners Isaac Souede and Simon Munir have four runners in this year’s race and their No 1 rider, Daryl Jacob, has opted to ride this one, though he remains a 33-1 outsider to give them a first National success. Won in the Rowland Meyrick Chase at Christmas, while a change of tactics from his usual front-running may be to blame for a lesser run last time. Unproven beyond three miles, has a fair bit to find with the market leaders and no obvious reason why he should bridge the gap going up in trip. A decent winner of the Grand National Trial at Haydock – on the heavy ground he loves – back in February 2021, but his form figures since look more like a bad Scrabble hand, with three Ps and a U. Never sighted in last year’s race, on much faster ground, and conditions are against him again this time. Would be a cheeky each-way stab if the heavens opened on Friday, but otherwise easily ruled out. There are several heavyweight contenders in Gordon Elliott’s National squad, but Coko Beach fits more snugly into the bantamweight division. Seven-year-olds simply don’t win the National these days, and while a win in last season’s Thyestes Chase is a plus, he was well beaten off a higher mark in the same race this season. Appeared to be running on fumes in a three-and-a-half mile race at Punchestown in February – and the National is another six furlongs. Emma Lavelle’s 10-year-old gets the nod for Best Outsider at around 40-1. His win in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury in 2019 is one of the best individual pieces of form on offer in this year’s field. He will race off the same handicap mark on Saturday and arrives on the back of an eye-catching run in February’s Denman Chase – his first start for 489 days after a tendon injury. Lavelle’s stable is a match for any when it comes to getting a top-notch horse big-race ready and it would be no surprise to see him outrun his odds. One of the better staying novice chasers in 2018/19, when he also won a handicap on the National undercard, but was off the track for 462 days before returning to action at Newbury in March. Has always looked likely to improve over a marathon trip but this is a swift return to action after a long break and he was among the potential rides that Daryl Jacob turned down. James Bowen gets the call-up as a result, but his third National ride looks no more likely to prevail than the first two. Showed up well for a long way as a 16-1 shot last year, and briefly threatened to do even better than his eventual finish in seventh when he moved towards the lead with four to jump. In the end, though, his finishing effort was tame, and even the veteran Blaklion managed to breeze past him on the run-in. His light schedule this year has clearly been designed with a return to Aintree in mind and co-owner Andrew Gemmell, of Paisley Park fame, has a happy knack of getting involved with fairytale success stories – but 40-1 does not feel unduly generous. Philip Kirby’s gelding should at least get a mention or two from the commentator as a confirmed front-runner, but shout-outs at the business end will be more a lot more difficult to achieve. His first experience over these fences ended with a heavy fall at the 12th fence in the Becher Chase in December, and even if that experience has not left a mark, his exuberant running style is likely to see his elastic band fully unwound with a few fences still to jump. Few trainers have as much to gain on Saturday as Ciaran Murphy, whose small stable would jump through several leagues if Enjoy D’Allen comes home in front. Murphy has been on the staff at Charlestown Stud for 25 years, but took over the licence only 15 months ago and has already seen his eight-year-old run third in last season’s Irish National. That form gives him a big chance on Saturday, so much so that JP McManus was persuaded to buy a share after a solid prep run. “I’ve been thinking about nothing else all year,” he said recently. “Winning would be off the Richter scale.” Murphy’s gelding is a fair 14-1 shot to record a ground-breaking success. A top-class chaser in his day, who finished second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2019 and fifth – under top weight – behind Tiger Roll in the National a few weeks later. He also finished fourth on his first startin 2018, but was never going well when attempting to make it third time lucky last season. He has shown no more than occasional glimpses of worthwhile form since and while handicap runners from the Tony Martin yard have a reputation for dramatic improvement when the big day arrives, little short of a miracle for him to make a mark this time around. A change of surroundings made a world of difference to Sandy Thompson’s gelding, who seemed to have peaked as long ago as November 2018, when he was third in the Ladbrokes Trophy for Alan King, but has found a new lease of life in Scotland. Runner-up in the Scottish National last April, but yet to recapture that kind of form this year and he did not seem impressed by the Aintree experience in the 2020 Becher Chase. A worthy 66-1 shot. Already a history-maker having won the Irish National at 150-1 last year. Run Wild Fred and Enjoy D’Allen, who are both at a much shorter price on Saturday, finished second and third that day so a return to that level would – theoretically, at least – make him a player, but subsequent form suggests it was a flash-in-the-pan moment. Sheila Mangan, his owner, backed him at 50-1, 66-1 and then 150-1 – “ah, for feck sake, I have to have a bit of that as well” as she put it – and will presumably do so again now, but only optimists will follow her in. Finished 129 lengths behind Minella Times 12 months ago, when he arrived at Aintree in something approaching fair form, having made the frame in the Thyestes Chase earlier in the campaign. Has not come anywhere close to that level so far this year and Sam Twiston-Davies’s mount is rightly bracketed with the no-hopers at around 150-1. Snapped up by Robert Waley-Cohen in February as a National mount for his son, the leading amateur rider Sam. The Waley-Cohen colours have been carried to victory six times over the Grand National fences, but never, as yet, in the National itself. While Noble Yeats has bits of form to suggest he could be an Aintree horse one day, his debut is probably coming at least a year too soon. Lucinda Russell was the last British trainer to win the National, with One For Arthur five years ago, and her runner this year put down an excellent marker with a doughty success in the 2021 Scottish National, when making only his sixth start over fences. He has failed to build on, however, and was reported to have suffered a breathing problem in the Edinburgh National in February. Better the further he goes, so the Aintree trip will hold no fears, but an immense leap of faith is required to back him on this year’s form. Set off as the much-fancied 11-2 favourite last year and was still chasing the leader five from home, but faded rapidly from there and was pulled up. A breathing problem was diagnosed and he had an operation to address it before returning to action this season, but the old Cloth Cap has yet to reappear. He looked like the best-handicapped horse in the field 12 months ago and is actually rated 1lb lower now at 25-1, but he found very little at the end of the Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster last time. Charlie Longsdon’s mare has plenty of the attributes you look for in a winner, up to and including Hollywood blockbuster potential – she would be the first mum to win the race. Snow Leopardess gave birth to a filly foal during an 18-month absence from the track, but that is just one strand of a remarkable storyline involving her breeder, 80-year-old Marietta Fox-Pitt. “I wasn’t any different after I had children,” Fox-Pitt says when asked why she sent Snow Leopardess back into training, “so why should she be?” Recuperated with Marietta’s son, the event rider William Fox-Pitt and his wife Alice Plunkett, part of the ITV Racing team, so her post-race interview has the potential to be teary TV gold. Odds of around 9-1 are short enough, however, as she did not have a huge amount to spare at the end of the Becher Chase in December. Like Snow Leopardess, attempting to become the first mare to win the National since Nickel Coin in 1951. Unlike Snow Leopardess, she has very little chance of doing so, and could well be the weakest link even in Mullins’s sub-par squad for this year’s race. Ran in a Grade One novice event at this meeting last year but that was over two-and-a-half miles and extreme distances remain a big unknown over fences. Also a sketchy jumper at times, taking a crunching fall on his latest start at Kempton Park, so an easy runner to dismiss when there are so many better alternatives on offer. Has scraped in towards the bottom of the list this year after narrowly missing out in 2021, but seems to show his best form on heavy ground and also at right-handed Sandown Park. Left behind from around a mile out in the Welsh National in December and highly unlikely to fare much better in the even more demanding surroundings of Aintree. A former favourite for this race – running well to finish fourth– and Dan Skelton’s gelding has winning form over the National fences too, in the Becher Chase. That, however, was all back in 2017, when Blaklion was a spry eight-year-old. It is 99 years since a teenager won the Grand National and it is more important than ever to have youth on your side these days. Easily overlooked. Won the Kerry National two seasons ago but had a year off in 2020/21 and has shown nothing in three starts in the current campaign. Form figures of 00P sum up his chance succinctly. Effectively “subbed” into the eight-strong Gordon Elliott squad when the stable scratched Battleoverdoyen earlier this week, creeping in at the foot of the weights. A dual Grade One winner earlier in his career and better the further he goes, so a fair chance of a top-10 finish if he rekindles his best form. Twenty-two lengths behind Snow Leopardess in the Becher Chase and little to no chance of reversing the form if his disappointing run in the Eider Chase at Newcastle last time is any guide. If you draw him in the sweep, have another go. The stress of the big race itself will be water off a duck’s back to connections after a nerve-shredding wait to see if their eight-year-old would get a run. It is a sign of how deeply competitive a modern National is that an easy winner of the Classic Chase at Warwick is struggling to make it in at the bottom of the weights. Now that he is confirmed as a runner, he will set off as one of the favourites. Followed up his Warwick success by running a cracker behind Win My Wings in the Eider, and the winner there bolted up in last week’s Scottish National. Simply making it into the final field is an achievement for Henry Daly’s gelding, who was 67th on the original list of weights in February. Returned to winning form at Ascot last time but the ground simply can’t be heavy enough for him – it would have needed to start raining on Monday to give him any chance. First reserve. Unraced since an easy win at Cheltenham in December, has been a weak finisher in the past. Second reserve. Pulled up after a bad mistake four out in the Kim Muir at Cheltenham last time. Third reserve. Looked a non-stayer when pulled up in the Midlands Grand National at Uttoxeter last time. Fourth reserve. Two races in Ireland since joining Patrick Griffin’s stable, showing no sign of form that gives him any chance here.

4/7/2022,"We begin with a political sketch show that sputteringly descends into farce. Elements of absurdist theatre seep in, then clowning and finally brooding despair. Rhum + Clay’s latest devised work is a Russian doll of a production, which peels back the layers of performance until it hollows out completely. The writers are occasionally a little too entranced by their own ingenuity but there are still plenty of powerful images and ideas here – particularly the growing sense that the time for play and pretence, in such politically fraught times, is over. Co-directors and performers Matt Wells and Julian Spooner, along with co-director Hamish Macdougall, have conceived Project Dictator in collaboration with a group of international artists, all living under oppressive regimes. Their influence isn’t felt in direct quotations (the script is far too meta for that) but is instead threaded into the outer edges of the production. It’s there in the flickers of fear in Wells and Spooner’s eyes as they peek anxiously into the wings; the sinister sway of the music and lighting; the absolute impossibility of stopping the show and beginning again. Long-term collaborators Wells and Spooner bring out the best in each other. Wells is the straight guy: a “polymath theatre maker” determined to make his “state of the nation” political satire. Spooner plays the comedy sidekick, puffing and panting with manic energy and hell bent on creating something fun. But while they’re a great double act, the earlier scenes feel caught somewhere between an Edinburgh sketch show and high-concept satire. They never quite take off. It’s only in the second half, when a diaphanous curtain drops down in front of the stage, that this show finally reveals itself. We’re left to peer at two clowns, frantically preparing backstage. It’s a powerful design from Blythe Brett that hints at a darker underbelly we choose to ignore: the fearful reality that lurks beneath all that political clowning. The music, performed live by Syrian Jazz musician Khaled Kurbeh, suddenly becomes stranger, scarier, ensnaring. We watch the clowns apply their makeup and, as the white powder swiftly covers over their features, disappear almost completely.

4/7/2022,"Harrison Dillard should never have won the 1948 Olympic 100 metres gold medal on a blazing July day at Wembley Stadium. He shouldn’t have been in the final at all. He entered the event at the American trials only to sharpen his speed work for the high hurdles – his specialist event. Back then the 25-year-old Clevelander was the greatest sprint hurdler the world had ever seen and had racked up 82 consecutive wins in the run up to the trials and held the world record of 13.6sec in the 120-yard hurdles. He was deemed unbeatable. Then catastrophe struck. He recalled: “All I had to do was finish third and I was in the team. But on that particular day, as history shows, I finished dead last. I hit the first hurdle, got over the second and then hit every other hurdle in succession, stopping completely at the eighth. I had totally lost the rhythm of the race and my timing was so completely destroyed I just stopped and didn’t even finish. Here I was the world record holder and American champion and it all went for nought because under the American system you qualify on that day or you don’t make it at all.” But he had managed to squeak third spot in the 100m, so he was able to join the US team on the boat to London for what became known as the austerity Games, a unifying moment of hope and spectacle for the British public in a city scarred by six years of war and blighted by strict rationing. The skinny Dillard, 143lb soaking wet and known to his teammates as “Bones”, then ran the race of his life to win one of the closest 100m finals in Olympic history. The Omega photo finish camera, used for the first time at the Games, captured the inches that separated Dillard, running on the outside lane, and US No 1 Barney Ewell in Lane 2, who was so convinced he’d won the race he bounded almost halfway around the track before realising the result hadn’t gone his way. On a lumpen cinder track, in front of 83,000 fans, Dillard had posted a time of 10.3sec, with Ewell second in 10.4sec and Panama’s Lloyd LaBeach third. Scot Alistair McCorquodale was fourth, with 100 yards world record holder Mel Patton, plagued once again by big competition nerves, fifth, and Britain’s highly fancied McDonald Bailey last. “To see the flag, the Stars & Stripes, as it goes up the flagpole while the national anthem is playing, with the medal around your neck, that’s when I think it really hits you,” he recalled. “I remember the hair standing up on the back of my neck as I stood to attention in that proud and particular moment. I don’t think I teared up, but I felt terrific emotion.” This weekend, nearly 75 years on, that medal is up for sale at the Ingrid O’Neil Olympic auction, in California. The estimate is somewhere north of $120,000. Olympic gold medals at auction are as rare as hen’s teeth and this is reckoned to be the first men’s 100m gold ever to come up for public sale. The big hope is one of the grander museums, either the Olympic Museum, in Lausanne, or the History Center, in Cleveland, will acquire it and display it to the public. But the pandemic has wrought merry hell with museum budgets, so no one is sure where it will go or what price it will fetch. What would Dillard have made of it all? He’d certainly have taken it all with a customary big smile and in that very large stride of his. He was a charming, humble and articulate man who won the hearts of everyone he met. He served in the second world war as one of the famed Buffalo Soldiers, a segregated black division who fought their way through Italy in some of the toughest battles of the conflict. He hardly mentioned it. Or the fact that none other than General George S Patton told newsmen, after watching Dillard win four events in a post-war GI track meet, that he was “the best goddam athlete I’ve ever seen in my life”. But he did love the fact that he had emulated his childhood idol and fellow Cleveland high schooler Jesse Owens. Dillard marvelled at the modern sprinters, especially Usain Bolt, but well into his 90th year he twinkled that “Jesse and I could have taken him, if we trained real hard.” His daughter Terri decided to sell the 100m medal – the first of four golds Dillard won at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics – but the other three will stay in the family. “It was a tough call to make but I’m hoping it will go to someone who will appreciate and honour it. Hopefully a museum where it can be on display. My dad never kept the medals on display at home, but he’d always get them out if anyone asked. My mother actually put one of them on a gold chain for him and he’d wear it sometimes.” After the 100m triumph in London, he collected another gold in a controversial sprint relay (where the US team won, was disqualified, protested and was later reinstated), then went back into training for the Helsinki Games of 1952. There he chose not to defend his 100m title, but to set the record straight in the 110m hurdles, running an Olympic record of 13.7sec to take gold and then collect another in the relay. He retired from the track after failing to make the US team for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, working first in the back office of the Cleveland Indians baseball club, before forging a long and successful career with the Cleveland Board of Education. He was always a popular visitor to big track meets around the world and returned to London in 2012 to watch Usain Bolt claim his second Olympic sprint title. Cleveland mourned when he died, in November 2019, at the age of 96.

4/7/2022,"Ukraine has called for more heavy weaponry from its western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow as EU member states prepared to halt Russian coal imports but remained divided over a more far-reaching energy ban. “My agenda is very simple,” the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday before a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels. It has only three items on it. It’s weapons, weapons, and weapons.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said new western sanctions especially from Europe did not go far enough and Russia would see them as “permission to attack”. Some politicians were still “unable to decide how to limit the flow of … oil euros to Russia so as not to put their economies at risk”, he said. The west must “bring Russia to justice”, Zelenskiy told the Greek parliament, and teach Moscow that “those who blackmail Europe with an economic and energy crisis always lose”. Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, said sanctions “must be ruinous enough for us to end this terrible war”. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc should approve its fifth round of economic sanctions, including a ban on Russian coal imports worth about €4bn (£3.3bn), on Thursday and that measures against Russian oil would be discussed by foreign ministers on Monday. “Sooner or later, I hope sooner, it will happen,” Borrell said. Zelenskiy is due to hold talks with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv on Friday, the Ukrainian government confirmed, adding that no advance details of the talks would be announced for security reasons. But while it welcomed a fresh wave of sanctions announced by the EU, Britain and the US – which targeted two daughters of Vladimir Putin as well as Russia’s biggest public and private banks – Ukraine insisted Europe in particular must go further. “We will continue to insist on full oil and gas embargo for Russia,” Kuleba said. “I hope we will never face a situation again, when to step up the sanctions pressure we need atrocities like Bucha to be revealed.” Images of dead civilians, some with their hands bound, in the streets of Bucha, a town north-east of Kyiv recaptured from Russian invaders, sparked international revulsion and renewed calls from Ukraine for the west to stop buying Russian energy. Kuleba stressed the vital importance of weapon supplies as well as sanctions, calling on “all allies to put aside their hesitations, their reluctance, to provide Ukraine with everything it needs”. He added: “The more weapons we get and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved.” Kyiv has urged its allies to supply more heavier weaponry such as air defence systems, artillery, armoured vehicles and jets as Moscow prepares to renew its assault on the east of the country six weeks into its brutal invasion of Ukraine. Kuleba said countries reluctant to supply offensive rather than defensive weapons were “hypocritical”, because there was “no longer any real distinction between the two” in the conflict. “I think the deal Ukraine is offering is fair,” he said. “You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine.” Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, agreed that the distinction was irrelevant and said the alliance’s members would step up with “air defence systems, anti-tank weapons but also heavier weapons”. Now, as Moscow repositions and rearms its forces, was the moment to do so, he said. EU sources said Europe’s ban on Russian coal imports – the key measure in its latest sanctions – would be approved on Thursday but would not take effect until August, a month later than previously proposed after pressure from Germany, the bloc’s top importer of Russian coal. The UK is due to ban Russian coal by year-end. Punitive measures on oil and gas, however, which are far more significant imports, have divided the EU27, with member states more dependent on imports from Russia afraid of the economic consequences. Russia accounts for about 40% of the EU’s natural gas consumption and a third of its oil imports. Ukraine on Thursday accused Hungary, which has said it is prepared to pay in rubles for Russian gas, of adopting an “unfriendly” position. “If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here’s how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU,” foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said. Budapest should “support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia’s military machine”, he added. “It is never too late to get on the right side of history.” Putin called Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has long sought a rapprochement with Moscow, to congratulate him after his party won a fourth consecutive term in general elections last week. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said a subsequent proposal by Budapest to host peace talks “looks cynical”.",News/World news,"Ukraine calls for ‘weapons, weapons, weapons’ from western allies",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/ukraine-calls-for-weapons-weapons-weapons-from-western-allies
4/7/2022,"Despite the bone-chilling cold of its location in Murmansk in Russia’s remote north-west, there’s a wonderful human warmth and humour in this offbeat romantic story of strangers on a train. It comes from Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, whose 2016 film The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki was a lovely comedy about a real-life Finnish boxing champ in the 1960s. His new film is adapted from a novel of the same name by Finnish artist and author Rosa Liksom, and concerns a young Finnish student of archaeology, Laura (Seidi Haarla) who is in Moscow sometime in the early 90s; she has begun an impulsive affair with her professor, Irina (Dirana Drukarova). Under Irina’s tutelage, with her encouragement, and perhaps because this older woman does not care to have Laura hanging around much longer, Laura has resolved to make the tough rail journey up to Murmansk where she wants to view the petroglyphs there - mysterious rock drawings, thousands of years old. Sweet-natured, open-hearted Laura gets on this uncomfortable train in the freezing wintry cold, where she finds that she must share compartment number 6 with Vadim (Yuriy Borisov), a boorish, drunk young guy who is on his way to get a job in a coal mine in Murmansk and is openly abusive, misogynistic and philistine about Laura’s plans. And her phone calls back to Moscow reveal that Irina isn’t exactly pining for her. Of course, it isn’t too much of a stretch to see that after their meet-uncute, the relationship of Vadim and Laura is going to thaw. The romance that flowers between these two young people is in parallel with the romance of a long rail journey, and this is a very non-American equivalent of Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise movies. Vadim’s scowling face and shaven, bullet head make him look a tough guy at first, but it isn’t long before we see him as a vulnerable little boy, never more so than when with Laura welcomes another Finnish guy to share their carriage - a self-admiringly sensitive type who insists on singing and playing his guitar. Vadim is fiercely sceptical and resentful of this preening interloper, and he is right to be. In the end, no one wants to help Laura find these petroglyphs that she has set her heart on and travelled so far to see, and it is Vadim himself who has to step up; there is charm and gentleness in this scene and the movie as a whole.

4/7/2022,"A person who is registered as non-domiciled with HM Revenue and Customs does not have to pay UK tax on income gained overseas – including on company stocks or cash made from selling a second home – unless they bring their money into the UK or deposit it into a UK bank account. However, non-doms do still have to pay tax on money earned within the UK. A person with non-dom status is someone who lives in the UK but has their permanent home outside the country. Their domicile – at least for tax purposes – is usually the country that their father considered their permanent home when they were born. That domicile may change if that person moves abroad and does not plan to go back. Non-doms have to specifically apply for a tax exemption on foreign income of more than £2,000, meaning it is not an automatic designation for foreign-born residents or non-citizens. The rule primarily benefits the very rich, and has allowed those claiming it to avoid paying significant sums to HMRC. A study by the London School of Economics and the University of Warwick found that more than two-fifths of people who earned £5m or more in 2018 had claimed non-dom status at some point since 1997. Some of the highest earning non-doms work in the film industry and sport, including famous actors, directors, producers and Premier League football players, according to the report, which also found that 22% of top-earning bankers have benefited from the scheme. Some of the most well-known people who have reportedly claimed non-dom status include Roman Abramovich, the now-sanctioned Russian oligarch and owner of Chelsea football club, the steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal and the media baron Lord Rothermere. Lord Ashcroft, the multimillionaire and former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, and the former HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver were also reported to have used the non-dom scheme. The same applied to Sir James Goldsmith and his children, including the Conservative minister and longtime friend of Boris Johnson, Zac Goldsmith. It emerged on Wednesday that Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, claims non-dom status, allowing her to potentially save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Murty’s father is the billionaire founder of the Indian-headquartered company Infosys, from which she receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her approximately 0.9% stake. Her non-dom status means she is not liable to pay the 38.1% tax usually applied to dividend payouts for UK-resident taxpayers. Under current law, Murty will automatically be deemed domiciled after living in the UK for 15 years. Murty, who married Sunak in 2009, soon after they met while studying for a master’s in business administration at Stanford University in Silicon Valley, moved to the UK in 2015. Her tax arrangement is legal and it is understood the chancellor declared his wife’s status to the Cabinet Office when he took office in 2018. A spokesperson for Murty has said she “has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income”. However, Labour has criticised Sunak for imposing tax increases on working households while his wife benefits from a scheme that has tended to help the wealthiest in the UK avoid national levies.",News/Politics,What is non-domicile status and who qualifies?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/what-is-non-domicile-status-and-who-qualifies-hmrc
4/7/2022,"Most American gun owners say they own firearms to protect themselves and their loved ones, but a study published this week suggests people who live with handgun owners are shot to death at a higher rate than those who don’t have such weapons at home. “We found zero evidence of any kind of protective effects” from living in a home with a handgun, said David Studdert, a Stanford University researcher who was the lead author of the Annals of Internal Medicine study. The study followed nearly 600,000 Californians who did not own handguns but began living in homes with handguns between October 2004 and December 2016, either because they started living with someone who owned one or because someone in their household bought one. It found that the absolute risk of living with a handgun owner was small, Studdert said, and that “the rates [of homicide] are low”. But it was important to consider the increase in a person’s risk of being killed, he added. The researchers calculated that for every 100,000 people in that situation, 12 will be shot to death by someone else over five years. In comparison, eight out of 100,000 who live in gun-free homes will be killed that way over the same time span. Those numbers suggest the risk rises 50%, but Studdert said it was actually higher: in a separate calculation designed to better account for where people live and other factors, the researchers estimated the risk was more than twice as high. In particular, the researchers found, people who lived with handgun owners had a much higher rate of being fatally shot by a spouse or intimate partner. The vast majority of such victims, 84%, were women, they said. Living with a handgun owner particularly increased the risk of being shot to death in a domestic violence incident, and it did not provide any protection against being killed at home by a stranger, the researchers found. People who lived with handgun owners “did not experience such fatal [stranger] attacks at lower rates than their neighbors in gun-free homes”, the researchers wrote, noting that stranger homicides at home were “a small minority” of the homicides observed in the study. The study focused only on homicide risk and did not examine how living with a handgun owner might increase or decrease the risk of being victimized in other ways, including by nonfatal assault, home invasion, or property theft. California is unusual in that it offers gun ownership data and other information not obtainable in almost any other state. That allowed the researchers to follow millions of people over many years to try to better establish what happened when a person began living in a home with a handgun, they said. The authors of the study acknowledged it had several shortcomings. For example, the researchers said they could not determine which victims had been killed by the handgun owners or with the in-home weapons. They couldn’t account for illegal guns and looked only at handguns, not rifles or other firearms. The dataset also was limited to registered voters in California who were 21 and older. It’s not clear that the findings are generalizable to the whole state, let alone to the rest of the country. But some outside experts said the work was well done, important and the largest research of its kind. “I would call this a landmark study,” said Cassandra Crifasi, a gun violence policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University. “This contributes to our understanding of the potential causal relationship between guns in the home and homicides.” The study was confined to California, but the risk was probably even greater in states with less stringent gun laws and where gun ownership was more common, Crifasi said. The results of the study come as the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in gun ownership during the pandemic. Previous research estimated that nearly 3% of US adults had become new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021, which translates to about 7.5 million Americans. Of those, about 5.4 million previously lived in a home with no guns. An early study of pandemic gun purchases found that there was no clear association between the increase in gun-buying and the increase in most kinds of interpersonal firearm violence in 2020, when a surge in gun violence drove a nearly 30% increase in the national murder rate. For decades, studies have shown guns in the home raise the risk of a violent death. Much of that work, including an earlier study by Studdert and his colleagues, focused on suicide. The new study goes further in addressing the perception that handguns are still worthwhile because of the safety they provide against being murdered, some experts said. “The reason people have guns in their home is for protection from strangers,” said David Hemenway, director of Harvard University’s Injury Control Research Center. “But what this is showing that having a gun in the home is bad for people in the home.”",News/US news,"People in homes with handguns more likely to be killed, major study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/guns-handguns-safety-homicide-killing-study
4/7/2022,"When Joan Jett was 13 years old, she had her first lesson on the electric guitar her parents had given her for Christmas. “I went in there all excited and said to the teacher: ‘I wanna play rock’n’roll,’” she says. “And he said to me: ‘Girls don’t play rock’n’roll. Let me teach you [the folk song] On Top of Old Smokey instead.’” Jett never went back for a second lesson – instead, she bought a book and taught herself to play. It wouldn’t be the last time a man tried to put her in her place: “It’s the hand in the face telling you ‘You can’t do this’ or ‘Don’t do that’,” she says. “And it’s not just in rock’n’roll, it’s everywhere.” This year marks 40 years since I Love Rock’n’Roll, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts’ cover of a song originally by the Arrows, reached No 1 in the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks. The Blackhearts were Jett’s second band; her first, the Runaways, in which she played rhythm guitar, had barged their way on to the Los Angeles punk scene in 1976, making their debut with the raucous single Cherry Bomb. By 1979, they had split up. Since those heady, chaotic early years, Jett has barely stopped. At 63, she continues to release albums on her label, Blackheart Records, and, pandemic notwithstanding, tours relentlessly. As the decades have passed, veneration of Jett as a feminist pioneer and all-round force of nature has grown. In 2010, Kristen Stewart played her in the biopic The Runaways (with Dakota Fanning as the band’s singer, Cherie Currie), while in 2018, Bad Reputation, Kevin Kerslake’s documentary named after one of Jett’s signature songs, traced her rise from snarling teen to rock’n’roll grande dame. It’s late afternoon at Jett’s Long Island home when we speak via video call. In a low-ceilinged room illuminated with fairy lights, she is relaxing after a late night playing her first concert in months. “Excuse my casualness here,” she says, slumped in an armchair, iPhone propped up on her knees. Dressed in regulation black vest and jeans, she is toned and athletic-looking. Her hair is just as it ever was: dyed black and heavily layered in the classic rocker’s shag cut. Liza Minnelli in Cabaret was among the inspirations for the teenage Jett’s look. “I loved the androgyny, or the gender-bending thing or however you want to put it,” she reflects. “My image was my armour. It’s not like I went around punching people, but people were intimidated and that was purposeful.” Also on our call is Jett’s longtime manager, producer, co-writer and best pal Kenny Laguna. As a keyboard player in the 1960s, he performed on a string of bubblegum hits including Mony Mony by Tommy James and the Shondells. He and Jett have worked together since 1979, when the Runaways fell apart and she graduated from rhythm guitarist to lead singer of the Blackhearts. As Laguna puts it in the documentary, he brought the pop while she “brought the menace”. Their relationship is entirely platonic – it was Laguna’s wife, Meryl, who suggested he seek out Jett after reading about her in the British music press. Nonetheless, they sound just like a married couple with their bossing and bickering. “Lift your head up, Kenny!” Jett barks at him, when he lets his camera slip. “We can’t see your mouth. It’s very unnerving.” Jett spent much of the pandemic at home going stir-crazy, so she couldn’t be happier to be back on stage. “It’s the longest I’ve ever gone [not performing] since I started in the business. There’s this song that Kenny and I wrote many years ago called You Don’t Know What You’ve Got, and that’s actually the case. It was pretty distressing, but then it was a gift in other ways. It forced you to slow down, and a lot of people have trouble with that, me included.” Along with a tour, there’s a new album, Changeup, a collection of acoustic versions of old tracks including Crimson and Clover and Bad Reputation. Jett loves to find new ways to play old songs – “You find all these nooks and crannies that you didn’t know were there,” she says. When I ask if she feels she might go mad if she has to crank out I Love Rock’n’Roll one more time, she looks appalled: “Not at all. For me, you’re playing it in front of new people every time, so it’s new. It can never be the same. I don’t want to have a lackadaisical attitude about these things. I don’t ever want to fake it.” Jett, who is the eldest of three siblings, credits her work ethic to her parents – her mother was a secretary and her father sold insurance. “I never saw them sitting around being lazy,” she says. “They instilled in me that I could do whatever I wanted to do, but I’d have to work hard at it.” For a while, they lived in Maryland, where Jett’s parents got her a horse. “We weren’t a rich family so I don’t know how they did that. But I’d travel about 40 miles on the weekends and I would take lessons in exchange for cleaning the stables. And I learned something from that.” The family later moved to LA, where Jett started hanging out at Rodney’s English Disco, a Hollywood nightclub that would play “glitter music” by the likes of the Sweet, David Bowie and T Rex. The music impresario Kim Fowley also frequented Rodney’s and put Jett, who was just 16, in touch with a young drummer, Sandy West. Jett went round to West’s house, they jammed for a bit and then called up Fowley and played a song down the phone. He was so impressed that he appointed himself their manager and helped recruit the rest of the band: singer Currie, guitarist Lita Ford and bassist Jackie Fuchs. The Runaways weren’t exactly welcomed with open arms. At gigs, people threw bottles, spat at them and called them sluts. Jett would go backstage and cry. Critics, struggling to get their heads around the notion of an all-girl punk band, dismissed them as a novelty act. “No one gave us any credit that we could play at all,” she says. “And that was really galling because we played better than a lot of the bands we opened for.” Weren’t her parents anxious about her being out all night playing dives? “I’m sure they were but they never said anything,” Jett replies. “They obviously told me to be careful and keep my wits about me. But they knew that I loved what I did.” Her parents had recently separated and, years later, Jett discovered her father used to secretly go to her gigs: “He would stand at the back and I never even knew he was there.” In contrast to their chilly reception in the US, the Runaways were adored in Europe and, for a while, the band set up home on a houseboat in Chelsea in London. “England values rock’n’roll!” pipes up Laguna. “I mean, you guys make rock’n’roll stars knights, right? I guess we canonise our movie stars. The Sex Pistols went to No 1 with pretty raw songs in England, but in America they didn’t do anything. The Runaways had humungous hits in Japan and Scandinavia, but they weren’t even considered by most American radio stations.” What paltry media coverage they got in the US invariably focused on their appearance and sexuality. Early in her career, Jett recalls doing an interview and being asked about sex. “And I thought to myself: ‘Well, here it is. If I answer this question, then every question will be about sex, and they’ll never talk about the music.’ I knew not to discuss my personal sex life ever – and I mean ever – in public, and not to feel bad about it. If they wanted to know about sex, it’s in the songs. It’s all there in the lyrics.” She’s not wrong: anyone curious about Jett’s sexual orientation need only pay attention to the pronouns in her version of Crimson and Clover (“Now I don’t hardly know her, but I think I could love her”). “Because you know everyone else has diarrhoea mouth now, and can’t keep it shut about what they do and who they fuck,” Jett continues. “I think rock’n’roll needs to have mystique. Especially with the way people are on social media – it doesn’t have that mysterious quality any more, which to me is tragic.” The Runaways lasted three-and-a-half years, and Jett had a blast, travelling the world and meeting her heroes, from Ramones to Sid Vicious. But a shadow was cast on the band’s history when, in 2015, Jackie Fuchs alleged that Fowley raped her at an aftershow party while she was incapacitated on quaaludes, in full view of Currie and Jett. Fowley died six months before Fuchs went public with the allegations. Both Jett and Currie issued statements denying having witnessed the assault. Jett wrote: “Anyone who truly knows me understands that if I was aware of a friend or a bandmate being violated, I would not stand by while it happened.” I ask Jett if the allegations led her to re-evaluate Fowley and her time in the band. There is a pause and she shakes her head. “I mean, Kim and I were friends. We got along, I wrote songs with him … I don’t know what else to say about it really.” When the Runaways split in 1979, musical differences were cited, though Jett was also uncomfortable at the way the band were being marketed. A photoshoot in which Currie was seen reclining in a corset was a particular source of ire. After the band went their separate ways, Jett started drinking heavily (she’s all but teetotal now) and developed a heart infection that landed her in hospital. During her recovery, she toyed with joining the army. “I knew I could use some discipline and direction,” she reflects. Jett says she has always felt a strong kinship with soldiers, and has played shows for troops in Kuwait, Kosovo, Iraq, Uzbekistan, Puerto Rico, Oman and beyond. “I feel connected to the military because I almost joined. Like now, when you see countries [like Ukraine] really fighting for freedom, it’s very moving and I know not to take that freedom for granted.” Jett was at her lowest ebb when she met Laguna. When I ask her if it was him that pulled her up and stopped her from self-destructing, she replies: “Absolutely. I had hope. Someone that believed in me. Nobody believed in me and all of a sudden this guy comes out of nowhere and writes songs with me. And then he hung around me and started to like me.” “Love you,” corrects Laguna gently, and Jett’s eyes suddenly fill with tears and she sniffs: “I’m getting emotional, sorry. I’m gonna put the phone down for a second. Kenny, you talk.” Laguna reminds me that Jett was 15 when she started writing songs. “The first song she ever wrote was You Drive Me Wild. When Wanda Jackson heard it, she went nuts. She said: ‘I’ve gotta record this.’ Joan was a little kid writing this stuff. Her poetry was overlooked partly because of the electric [guitars] but also because people weren’t taking women rock’n’rollers seriously. If she’d been a guy, they’d have treated her like Tom Petty or Bob Dylan.” Laguna and Jett still have the rejection letters from the record companies that passed on their Blackhearts demos – all 23 of them. Rather than throw in the towel, they started their own label and sold records at shows. For a time, Laguna’s Cadillac was the company office (the label is now run by his daughter and Jett’s goddaughter, Carianne Brinkman). The release of I Love Rock’n’Roll in 1982 coincided with the rise of MTV and suddenly they were everywhere. The single sold 10m copies and the band were soon playing stadiums. Jett is back, the tears all gone. I remark that she seems to have taken several younger musicians under her wing over the years. Bikini Kill’s Kathleen Hanna, whose biggest single Rebel Girl was produced by Jett, has said she is “like family”. She is also close to Miley Cyrus, who covers Cherry Bomb at concerts, and who gave a speech thanking Jett “for fighting for our freedom” when she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. “I always try to make sure that I connect with and support [young women] in any way I can,” she says. “Most of the time they’re going through the same things that I’ve been through many times over.” Despite this, talk of her legacy makes her uncomfortable. Jett doesn’t like to be put on a pedestal. “When people say “punk queen”, I’m, like, you got Patti Smith, man, you can’t compete with that. I want to be ‘a’ one rather than ‘the’ one, otherwise the only way is down. There’s this Maya Angelou quote which says: ‘People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel.’ I just wanna make people feel good.” Changeup by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts is out now on Blackheart Records.",Arts/Music,"‘If you want to know about sex, it’s in the songs’: Joan Jett on punk, privacy and almost joining the army",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/07/if-you-want-to-know-about-sex-its-in-the-songs-joan-jett-on-punk-privacy-and-almost-joining-the-army
