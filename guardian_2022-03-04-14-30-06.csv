3/4/2022,"Australia’s foreign minister has condemned the shelling of a large nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying it shows “the recklessness and dangers” of Vladimir Putin’s war. The Ukrainian government reported earlier on Friday that the Russian army was “firing from all sides” upon the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – the largest of its kind in Europe – and a fire had broken out. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said: “The world condemns that behaviour and Australia strongly so.” Authorities at the plant have since said the facility is secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed” but the incident attracted the concern of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which said the fire had not affected “essential” equipment. Payne told the ABC: “That just seems to me to absolutely reinforce the complete breach of any aspect of international law, and all aspects of international law, that apply here, of the UN charter, and to reinforce the unlawful behaviour that President Putin is engaged in.” Deeply concerned about reports of shelling & fire at Zaporizhzia Nuclear Power Plant. The recklessness & dangers of Putin’s war are demonstrated by the direct threat & risks Russia is posing to critical infrastructure in #Ukraine, including nuclear power facilities. The minister also argued Australian sanctions were starting to have an effect, with $45m belonging to a designated Russian entity currently being “frozen in an Australian financial institution”, although she did not go into details. Payne said the coordination of sanctions among Australia, Europe, the UK, the US, Japan and South Korea was “a very important indicator of that strength of unity globally in opposition to Russia’s appalling actions”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he did not believe Putin would be “dissuaded from his murderous acts” in Ukraine, but that should not stop the rest of the world from “tightening the vice” on the Russian leader. Morrison raised “deep concerns” about the close alignment between China and Russia, and it was important to send a “very clear message to anyone else, any other autocratic regime, and we know about a few of those in our own region … [to] not take the wrong lesson out of this”. Morrison acknowledged there were differences between Taiwan – the democratically governed island of 24 million people that Beijing claims as its breakaway province – and Ukraine. But he also called for greater preparedness for potential instability in the Indo-Pacific region, after joining an urgently convened virtual meeting with his counterparts from Japan, India and the US – known as the Quad – early Friday morning. The Quad meeting discussed the crisis in Ukraine and “assessed its broader implications” – but the joint statement issued by the four leaders did not include any direct criticism of Russia, and said countries in the Indo-Pacific must be “free from military, economic, and political coercion”. India is particularly keen to keep the Quad focused on the Indo-Pacific, and it has so far abstained from UN votes condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Morrison played down the lack of unity with India on the response to Ukraine, saying he “wouldn’t put them in the same category as China, not even remotely”. The prime minister noted India was calling for an end to the violence, and said Australia needed to “work patiently with our partners”. He said he believed there was “a very clear understanding of what the implications would be if China were to seek to realise its ambitions for Taiwan”. The longstanding US policy is to support Taiwan’s self-defence – including by arms exports to Taiwan – and to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo. The US retains “strategic ambiguity” about whether it would come to Taiwan’s aid in the event of a military conflict. The Australian defence minister, Peter Dutton, was accused of going beyond longstanding bipartisan support for the status quo, when he said in November it would be “inconceivable” that Australia would not participate if the US launched military action in the event Beijing sought to seize Taiwan. The New York Times reported this week that senior Chinese officials had told their Russian counterparts in early February not to invade Ukraine before the conclusion of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The paper cited Biden administration officials and a European official who cited a western intelligence report. China’s foreign ministry vehemently denied the report, denouncing it as “fake news” designed to “divert attention and shift blame, which is utterly despicable”. The foreign ministry also blamed Nato’s eastward expansion and the US administration’s attitude towards Ukraine’s Nato membership for the deterioration of relations with Russia. Payne told 4BC radio it was “ultimately for China” to respond to the reports, but added: “Any collaboration on this illegal, unjustified and unprovoked Russian invasion would be deeply concerning.” The Australian opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said China had a “particular responsibility” to use its close relationship with Russia to press for an end to the aggression.",News/World news,"Russian attack on Ukraine nuclear plant shows ‘recklessness and dangers of Putin’s war’, Australia says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russian-attack-on-ukraine-nuclear-plant-shows-recklessness-and-dangers-of-putins-war-australia-says
3/4/2022,"Pet food containing endangered sharks is being fed to cats and dogs by unwitting owners, a study has revealed. Scientists found that several brands contained endangered species but listed only vague ingredients such as “ocean fish”, meaning that consumers are often oblivious. “The majority of pet owners are likely lovers of nature, and we think most would be alarmed to discover that they could be unknowingly contributing to the overfishing of shark populations,” said the study authors, Ben Wainwright and Ian French, of Yale-NUS College, Singapore. Shark populations are overfished throughout the world, with declines of more than 70% in the past 50 years. As apex predators they are crucial for the balance of the ocean food chain, and the loss of sharks has had knock-on effects on seagrass beds and coral reefs. The sale of shark fins has been widely publicised. But a silent contributor, the authors say, is the use of shark products in everyday items such as pet food and cosmetics. Using DNA barcoding, the scientists tested 45 pet food products from 16 brands in Singapore. Most products used generic terms such as “fish”, “ocean fish”, “white bait” or “white fish” in the ingredients list to describe their contents, with some specifically listing tuna or salmon. Others did not indicate fish at all. Of the 144 samples sequenced, 45 – roughly a third – contained shark DNA. The most frequently identified species were blue shark, silky shark and whitetip reef shark. The silky shark and the whitetip reef shark are listed as “vulnerable” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Products containing DNA of the sicklefin weasel shark, the Caribbean sharpnose shark and the sand tiger shark – all vulnerable species – were also identified. The authors suggest the meat could be taken from shark carcasses that would be discarded after the valuable fins are removed, or could reflect a growing shark meat trade. They are calling for more accurate ingredients labelling so that people know what they are feeding to their pets and where it came from. Dr Andrew Griffiths, an ecologist at the University of Exeter, said the latest work followed research by his team and others revealing the presence of shark DNA in food products for human consumption, including the sale of spiny dogfish and hammerhead shark meat in fish and chip shops. For pet foods, he said, the lack of rules on specific labelling meant a wide variety of vulnerable species could be legally included. “There aren’t any specific rules against it,” he said. “You could be unwittingly getting just about any fish.” Besides the lucrative trade in shark fins, shark meat is generally quite low value, Griffiths said, and could be a cheap source of protein. “Lots of people don’t want to eat it,” he said. “So you can’t necessarily sell it through other supply chains. It surprises people that these things can turn up on their pet’s plate.” The findings are published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science.",News/Environment,"Endangered sharks found in cat and dog food, DNA study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/endangered-sharks-found-in-cat-and-dog-food-dna-study-shows
3/4/2022,"Naamcial’s craft beers often have distinctly Thai flavours, as he experiments with the country’s native produce, boiling the pulp of jackfruit and mango to mix into different creations. Yet his homemade products are forbidden in the kingdom. Talking to the Guardian under a pseudonym, Naamcial says he would like to operate a legal brewery, but Thailand’s laws around alcohol production make this ambition almost impossible for newcomers. Current laws restrict brewing licences to manufacturers that have capital of 10 million baht (£230,000), while brewpubs must produce at least 100,000 litres a year and only serve their beer on their premises. The legislation effectively blocks new, small breweries from opening, and tips the market firmly in favour of two powerful companies – Thai Beverage, which produces Chang beer, and Boon Rawd Brewery, which produces Singha and Leo. Attempting to loosen these companies’ grip on the Thai beer market, an MP for the opposition Move Forward party, Taopiphop Limjittrakorn, has proposed a new draft law on excise tax, which is under consideration by the Thai cabinet, and which he hopes will make the market accessible to smaller producers. The law would boost the economy, he says. Furthermore, if passed, the law would mark a symbolic change. “It will let ordinary people do the same business as rich people do.” In 2017, before he entered politics, Taopiphop was arrested for brewing craft beer at home. He was fined 5,000 baht for brewing illegally without a permit, and a further 500 baht for owning brewing yeast. For some, craft beer is associated with anti-establishment politics. “It’s very similar to the French Revolution, which started from a cafe in Paris, where people drank coffee,” says Taopiphop. “The fuel of the revolution is not coffee any more, it’s craft beer.” Taopiphop adds that, after the 2014 coup in Thailand, many pro-democracy activists chose to meet in Bangkok’s craft beer bars. At Bangkok’s Dok Kaew House Bar, a craft beer bar based in a 100-year-old house – which owners say is also inhabited by five ghosts – locals perch at the bar sipping pale ale and cider. Co-owner Nuttapol Sominoi hopes for change. “It’s a monopoly, a closed market, where there is no competition,” he says. Beside him, a chalkboard lists the various beers on tap, most of which are international. In a fridge lined with cans and glass bottles, there are a few Thai options. One, though, bears a label saying it has been manufactured in Vietnam. Some Thai companies resort to brewing their beers in neighbouring countries and importing them to Thailand to get around the law, though doing so is costly. A ban on alcohol advertising in Thailand makes business harder still for newcomers. Even sharing a picture of your beer on social media can result in a fine of 50,000 baht if the logo is visible. “It affects us a lot,” says Supawan Kaewprakob, co-founder of Ther, an all-female brewing project. “We can’t advertise or communicate with our customers about the product at all. We can’t even describe the ingredients or post pictures. It’s illegal, which doesn’t make sense. It clearly blocks small businesses from growing.” The laws are stifling creativity and the economy, Nuttapol adds, and result in less choice for consumers. It’s particularly galling, given that Thailand offers such advantages for craft brewers. “In western countries they have to use extracts, but we have the fresh ingredients,” he says. Were the craft beer scene allowed to develop, it would boost agriculture by drawing on local products, and attract tourists to Thailand’s resorts, Nuttapol says. Bars, along with the tourist sector, have struggled immensely during the pandemic, and face continued restrictions on their operations. Dok Kaew House Bar received no compensation during the pandemic, according to its owners. They are surprised they have managed to stay open. Supporters of Thailand’s alcohol laws and restrictions on its sales during Covid say such measures are necessary to protect public health. However, Taopiphop argues that alcohol has been unfairly scapegoated in Thai society, especially during the pandemic. Policy is also influenced by a Buddhist belief that alcohol is sinful, he adds. If his proposed bill is passed, he hopes it could pave the way to removing laws that stifle entrepreneurship in other industries. For now, much of Thailand’s craft beer network is operating underground. Naamcial says he is trying to limit his social media presence to avoid attracting attention from the authorities. He finds most of his customers through word of mouth from trusted contacts. It’s normally neighbours who tip off the police, he adds, but his are yet to complain.He hopes the law will change, but says he’ll continue to brew his beer regardless. He loves the craft of brewing, and the uniqueness of the end result. “[With] my process, and my tools, it’s the only way to make my beer,” he says.",News/World news,Bangkok’s illicit craft brewers risk arrest under draconian laws,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/bangkoks-illicit-craft-brewers-risk-arrest-under-draconian-laws
3/4/2022,"Five Russian soldiers sit in a brick building. They are blindfolded: the latest prisoners to be captured inside Ukraine. A Ukrainian voice interrogates them. “Speak,” he says to the group’s Russian officer. What message would he like to send to his soldiers and to Russians back at home? “Frankly speaking, they tricked us,” the officer replies, referring to his military superiors sitting in Moscow. “Everything we were told was a fake. I would tell my guys to leave Ukrainian territory. We’ve got families and children. I think 90% of us would agree to go home.” The three-minute video was filmed under conditions of duress. The soldiers are evidently scared. And yet there are numerous similar interviews with Russian captives which have been circulating on Ukrainian social media channels, expressing similar sentiments. Asked what he would tell his commanders, one said bluntly: “They are faggots”. Another phrase frequently used is oni obmanuli nas: they duped us. Eight days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion it is clear that a significant number of his servicemen are demoralised and reluctant to fight. Some have given themselves up. Others have abandoned their vehicles and have set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to brutal shelling of civilians. But low morale among invading troops might be one reason why Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine appears not to have progressed at the speed Putin would have wanted. The assumption in Moscow was that the operation would be swift and successful. Soldiers were given food and fuel supplies for only two or three days, the videos suggest. The Kremlin also appears to have had a totally fantastical idea of the reception they would get. Several prisoners of war said they had been assured Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators. Russian forces were expecting flowers and cheers, not bullets and bombs, they said. “Some of them thought they were on military exercises. They didn’t anticipate resistance,” Artem Mazhulin, a 31-year-old English teacher from Kharkiv said. “A lot are conscripts born in 2002 or 2003. We are talking about 19-year-old and 20-year-old boys.” He added: “Since 2014 the Russian government has been brainwashing its population with propaganda. They try and make Russia believe Ukraine is not a real country and say fascist monsters have captured it.” Mazhulin said his uncle and aunt, Viktor and Valentina, had talked with Russian soldiers when they rolled past their house in Kupiansk, in north-east Ukraine, close to the border. The soldiers explained they were looking for Banderivtsi, or followers of the second world war Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera. “My uncle said to them: ‘Where the fuck do you see Banderivtsi?’ My aunt told them to get off her flowerbeds,” Mazhulin recounted. “They called my uncle Batya (Dad) and chatted with him about pigeon breeding, his hobby. Then they drove off on their tank.” In a video address on Thursday Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelesksiy pressed home the same message: that Putin has sent his invading forces into Ukraine without an understandable mission. “They are demoralised. They are doomed,” he said, telling enemy soldiers to “go home”. Ukraine claims to have killed several thousand Russian troops. This figure may be an exaggeration, but on Wednesday, however, even the Kremlin admitted 498 of its servicemen had died, with 1,591 wounded. Alex Kovzhun, a one-time adviser to Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, said Russian soldiers could be divided into two sorts: “There are the young conscripts who are scared shitless. And there are career guys who have fought in Syria and the Donbas.” Kovzhun said the Russian general staff had thought the invasion would be “easy peasy”, and a repeat of the operations to seize Crimea in 2014, or their recent deployment to Kazakhstan, which were largely unopposed. Instead, Ukrainian civilians had stood in front of enemy tanks, blocked armoured columns with their bare hands and had sung the national anthem in front of twitchy Russian guards. “They shout expletives in front of armed people. I’ve seen the Russian faces. They are very uncomfortable because it’s not what they expected. They were told Ukrainians were imprisoned by mythic Nazis,” he added. Nick Reynolds, a research analyst for land warfare at the defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said the Ukrainian figure for killed enemy soldiers was likely to be a more reliable than the Russian estimate, adding that the footage of engagements involving Russian forces available online suggested the toll the Kremlin was willing to admit to had already been exceeded. Nevertheless, he added, there is little to show how the Ukrainian authorities have arrived at their own total. The several thousand dead tally could itself be a slight exaggeration, he said. There is no doubt Ukraine is utilising the discomfort of captured soldiers for propaganda purposes. Several videos show young men calling their mothers back in Russia, who have no idea their sons are fighting in Ukraine. The mothers typically break down. The Ukrainian authorities have opened a hotline for worried Russian relatives, in another PR scoop. Nonetheless, there is an authentic sense that many Russian servicemen regret ever having come to Ukraine, a journey that has ended for some in death or disillusionment. One interrogator asks a prisoner: “So, what do you think, are you soldiers of the strong Russian army or cannon fodder?” “We are cannon fodder,” the PoW replies. “Was it worth it?” the interrogator says, by way of follow-up. “No,” the prisoner says.

3/4/2022,"The BBC’s website may have been blocked in Russia, hours after the corporation brought back its shortwave radio service in Ukraine and Russia to ensure civilians in both countries can access news during the invasion. BBC Russia also reported that Meta, formerly known as Facebook, also appeared to be blocked, as was the Russian- and English-language online newspaper and news aggregator Meduza, the US government-funded broadcaster Radio Liberty and Google Play. The signs the BBC was being blocked emerged hours after the BBC’s decision to revert to a mostly obsolete form of broadcasting, broadcasting four hours of its world service, read in English, to Ukraine and parts of Russia each day. “It’s often said truth is the first casualty of war,” BBC director general Tim Davie said in announcing the move on Thursday. “In a conflict where disinformation and propaganda is rife, there is a clear need for factual and independent news people can trust … millions more Russians are turning to the BBC.” According to Globalcheck, a service that tracks internet censorship in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the BBC website’s availability is at 17% of normal levels in Russia, which suggests some services have been blocked. The German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle also reported in Russian that the BBC site was not working in Russia. However, the website https://bbc.com is not listed on the registry of banned sites kept by state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor.

The BBC’s shortwave radio broadcast can be found on 15735 kHz from 6pm to 8pm and on 5875 kHz from midnight to 2am, Ukraine time. The BBC’s move to bring back shortwave came days after Russia launched two missiles on Kyiv’s TV tower, killing five people and knocking out some access to news and broadcasts. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, wrote on Twitter that the Kremlin was preparing to cut off communications and spread “massive fake messages that the country’s leadership has given up”. Russia has clamped down on public dissent at home, while Kremlin-backed media organisations such as RT have been pulled internationally. The Kremlin has complained about the BBC’s coverage of the invasion, with Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claiming without evidence that the BBC “plays a determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security”. Zakharova also claimed Russia had been the victim of “unprecedented information terrorism” that was “creating hysteria around Ukrainian events”. The BBC has reported huge increases in its audiences in Ukraine and Russia since the invasion began. In the last week of February, viewership of BBC’s Ukrainian language website more than doubled from a year earlier to 3.9 million visitors. Its Russian-language website has reached a record 10.7 million visitors over the past week, more than tripling its weekly 2022 average. Shortwave radio uses frequencies that can travel long distances and are accessible on portable radios, making it the go-to method to reach listeners in conflict zones throughout history. Shortwave was used extensively in Europe to broadcast propaganda during the second world war, and usage peaked during the cold war. But as radio technology developed, along with the mass adoption of online news, shortwave fell out of favour around the world. After 76 years, the BBC World Service ended its shortwave broadcast to Europe in 2008.

3/4/2022,"It took three days after the rescue to get back and assess the damage to my partner’s home in North Lismore. At least it is still standing. Everything is brown. Muddy waters and debris block our way so we grab some washed-up scaffolding and wood to make a bridge to cross the water-filled ditch over the back of the disused rail line. My partner, his friend, my eight-year-old son and I cross the bridge crab-style, then climb over the railway tracks and through more muddy water into the backyard. The smell is horrendous. It’s a mix of rotting rubbish, diesel, dust and mud. The sky is a piercing blue, an ironically beautiful day after such a cataclysmic event. We are grateful for the sun after such relentless rain but the stunning blue against the muddy landscape is jarring. I wonder what is happening in Ukraine. I had heard in passing that Vladimir Putin might press the button. As if my brain can contemplate that right now. Before the floods I was engaged in the geopolitics of the Russian invasion but now the war is in my backyard. That is the only way to describe the scene here. Sometimes you can’t even have a conversation because of the noise of the helicopter overhead, still rescuing people three days later. All around are brown mud, dust, broken buildings and scattered possessions strewn and piled across the landscape. But it’s the putrid smell that overwhelms every sense and we know it will grow in intensity as the hot day ferments the rotting detritus and vegetation. We get to the front yard and up the muddy steps to the porch. The smell is so intense I nearly vomit. The porch freezer is upturned and its contents are rotting. We go inside. We can’t even get into one of the rooms as the door is jammed. Every piece of furniture, drawer, cupboard, fridge, washing machine and belonging has been strewn about the house. Then we hear the squeaks. My partner races in, frantically climbing over the upturned furniture and bed and there is Prince, our beautiful long-haired guinea pig. Alive, along with his harem of girls. This small mercy breaks us. We thought all the animals were dead. Somehow the guinea pigs survived, floating to the ceiling in their tubs which didn’t capsize despite the 15m flood height. Back out in the glaring sun, we don’t know where to start. It is too overwhelming, not just what we have to deal with here, but the whole situation; our neighbours, our destroyed town, the reality of a house washed against the bridge. I think of the lady who was clinging for her life to the window of her house and wonder whether she made it out alive. The police don’t want us in the city centre today as they pull out bodies. We were lucky we didn’t die. I called the State Emergency Service at 6am on Monday morning after climbing to our attic to wait out the flood. But the waters kept rising. After seven hours of waiting to be rescued, we hailed a passing tinnie driven by a local, Sandro – an unknown neighbour over the railway line. Sandro and Amanda left their house, searching for their dog, Diesel, and instead ended up rescuing more than 100 people that day. Likewise our friends Aidan and Tim left their homes and belongings to drown and took to their tinnie, despite the SES instructing people not to use their own boats to save people. Thank goodness for our local heroes because the two SES rescue boats could not keep up. As Sandro took us to the nearest land, we saw roofs cut open where people had sheltered in their attics – only to realise that they would become their coffins if the water kept rising. We drive through Lismore’s central business district – it looks as though it has been bombed. Business owners are piling everything on to the street to make way for the rubbish collection that will last for weeks and resemble a post-apocalyptic horror film. Many won’t recover from this. Businesses are saddled with debt from the last flood and the preceding two years of Covid lockdowns; it’s too much to bear. My partner cried for months after the 2017 flood, seeing the damage done to our much-loved town but this time we are numb to it. My son is in shock, going quiet at the state of his beloved CBD and then crying for hours as he tries to come to terms with it and the fact that his school is gone and closed indefinitely. I don’t know how we can recover. When will the next flood come – or will the bushfires get us next? I see on Twitter that the PM has Covid and is calling this flood a “natural disaster”. This same narrative is parroted by the government. But there is nothing natural about it. This is climate change in action, and pretending we aren’t experiencing a climate catastrophe right now is dangerously irresponsible. Remember, we are only at the beginning of the hockey stick curve. Things are going to get much worse. Until the pandemic created insane house prices, Lismore was an affordable place to live. North Lismore, being on the floodplain and victim of the CBD levy rather than a beneficiary, was the most affordable and is home to some of the most endearing, as well as the most vulnerable, members of our community. For almost everyone on the floodplain, flood insurance is a near impossibility, with premiums close to $30,000 a year. Despite people spending more than $100,000 to raise their homes above the nominal one-in-100-year flood height, this flood exceeded such levels by more than 2m. For many people in North Lismore, this meant more than 5m of water on the ground, drowning homes, lives and people’s futures under a sea of mud. We are at the threshold of climate catastrophe and it’s communities like ours that are bearing the brunt of it. It has not just lapped at our doorstep, it smashed right through our doors. It has destroyed our CBD and our loved ones have drowned to death. These climate catastrophes are going to happen more frequently, with more intensity, more damage and more deaths, and we will see more communities collapsing. Back at the frontline of the climate crisis, we set up a wash station. Our neighbours, drenched in muddy water, come by. Their boat capsized and they lost their phones and laptops to the dreaded waters. We hug, adrenaline and shock pulsing through our veins, preventing tears from forming. More rain is coming. Maybe it’ll wash some of the dirt off the house, we say. No, no more rain. Please. I see I have missed a call. I listen to the message, it’s the SES. Do we still need to be rescued? As I write this, fuel has run out, our water is about to run out and the one supermarket left has no food on its shelves. What is our government doing?
