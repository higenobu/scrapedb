3/4/2022,"By Peter Eisler WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than a half dozen U.S. Secret Service officers on Thursday took two men into custody from a car in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood and removed what seemed to be an assault-style rifle from the vehicle, a Reuters witness said. The two men were handcuffed and separated, according to the Reuters reporter who witnessed the incident. The witness said the officers also pulled what appeared to be body armor components from the car. The vehicle was a black four-door Ford sedan with Indiana plates that said Marine Corps Veteran. One of the suspects wore tan pants and a black hoodie, while the other wore a camouflage-style jacket and a baseball cap, according to the witness and photographs from the scene. The Secret Service, which protects U.S. political leaders and their families, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department referred questions to the Secret Service. The incident occurred in the heart of Georgetown, an upscale neighborhood of shops and homes popular with tourists. The area is also home to many current and former government officials. Police removed multiple military-style bags from the car, like duffles and packs, mostly Army green, and emptied their contents on the trunk and the street, video from the incident showed. Some items, including what appeared to be body armor plates, were laid on the ground and photographed by officers. At least one of the suspects was taken away in a Secret Service van.

3/4/2022,"French President Emmanuel Macron held a 90 minute phone call instigated by President Vladimir Putin Thursday in which any hopes to call off the war were quickly extinguished. After hanging up, Macron–one of the few world leaders still taking the Russian leader’s calls—felt simply, “the worst is yet to come.” The call came as a cavalcade of increasingly crazy stories emerged from Moscow which signaled Putin was becoming ever more isolated and willing to lash out at Ukraine and his own people. In the Kremlin readout of the call, Putin promised the “special military operation will be fulfilled in any case,” referring to the invasion in less than accurate terms. “Attempts to gain time by dragging negotiations will only lead to additional requirements for Kyiv in our negotiating position,” Putin said. Macron, for his part, tried to convince Putin that his plans to “denazify Ukraine,” using vintage Soviet terminology, is “a lie” and “an insult to the history of Russia and Ukraine, to the memory of our elders who fought side by side against Nazism.” Putin, who denied shelling Ukrainian cities even as they were being bombarded during the call, was clearly unmoved by the argument. Afterwards, an aide to Macron told reporters: “The expectation of the president is that the worst is to come, given what President Putin told him... There was nothing in what President Putin told us that should reassure us. He showed great determination to continue the operation.” The war, now one week old, has killed thousands of Ukrainian citizens and reportedly many more Russian soldiers, but the bombing continues as Russian troops—some not even military school graduates—continue to close in on the capital Kyiv. But as blood continues to flow on the battlefield, new information about Putin’s crazy world are truly terrifying. The Times of London reported that Putin was so secretive about his plans for invading Ukraine that not even his cabinet knew what he was cooking up after being told he only planned to recognize the two separatist areas. “This is fucked up. They are out of their fucking minds!” someone in the government told the Agentstvo news outlet. And those officials who threatened to resign over the invasion were met with a worse threat: treason charges punishable by hard labor. “Resignation will lead only to a prison camp,” one official reportedly said. Other reports from the battlefield suggest Russia had pointed its own multi-rocket launching systems toward the border town of Popovka in what was likely a “false flag” operation site ready to go off at any moment so Russia can justify its brutal onslaught. Bloomberg reported that if resistance by Ukrainians continues, he may introduce public executions in captured cities. Meanwhile, inside Russia, things are not much better as growing dissenters—including young school children—are being rounded up, beaten and jailed. Media outlets are being stifled and it is illegal to publish truth about the war or protest against it. And new legislation introduced in Russia on Thursday added an extra punishment: anyone arrested for protesting will be forced to fight in the invasion themselves. As one Russian expert put it: “What the fuck is happening to Russia. This is absolute madness.” Meanwhile, the list of businesses fleeing Russian territory grows by the day with Ikea and Volkswagen the latest to pull out. Still, gallows humor continues to lessen the weight of the fog of war. On Thursday, investigative group Bellingcat had the last word. After a Russian court fined them a half million rubles for not branding itself a “foreign agent” last July, the group now says that the ruble has crashed under the weight of sanctions, they will pay up, tweeting: “We will wait one week and then gladly pay the 10 cents.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/4/2022,"Jaime Harrison said Boebert and Greene ""might as well"" have been wearing trash bags at the State of the Union. ""It was that sitting in the garage for a week type of trash,"" the DNC chair said of their antics. They chanted ""build the wall,"" and Boebert heckled Biden as he discussed his dead son. The reviews are coming in for GOP Reps. Lauren Boebert's and Marjorie Taylor Greene's antics during President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday — and Jaime Harrison, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, was among those less than impressed. In response to a tweet from the former South Carolina state lawmaker Mandy Powers Norrell calling the congresswomen ""trashy,"" Harrison said: ""They might as well have been wearing hefty bags… it was that sitting in the garage for a week type of trash."" Boebert and Greene heckled Biden at various points during his first State of the Union address. They also turned their backs and refused to applaud as Biden entered the chamber. The two congresswomen tried to start a ""build the wall"" chant as Biden spoke about immigration reform, but other Republican lawmakers refused to join in, and one person on the Democratic side of the aisle told them to sit down. Boebert heckled Biden as he was discussing the health effects of toxic burn pits on US service members and veterans, including the role burn pits may have played in his son Beau's death at 46 from brain cancer. ""When they came home, many of the world's fittest and best-trained warriors were never the same. Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness. A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know,"" Biden said. Boebert then shouted, ""You put them in, 13 of them."" ""One of those soldiers was my son Maj. Beau Biden,"" Biden continued. ""We don't know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer or the diseases of so many of our troops. But I'm committed to finding out everything we can."" Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a leading House Democrat, told Insider after the speech that Boebert's outburst was ""disgraceful."" ""I don't know that I belong to the same human race as someone who thinks it makes sense to yell at someone when they're talking about their dead son,"" he said. Harrison compared the outburst to when GOP Rep. Joe Wilson shouted ""You lie!"" at President Barack Obama during a joint address of Congress in 2009. ""After Joe Wilson's 'You Lie' embarrassment a few years ago you would have thought the GOP would have potty trained their unruly toddlers but I guess after last night's disrespectful antics some of the toddlers have become juvenile delinquents,"" Harrison tweeted. The two far-right congresswomen, both elected in 2020, are known for making inflammatory statements and derisive comments and getting into confrontations with their colleagues in the Capitol. Greene, who last year was removed from her committee assignments and was recently permanently suspended from Twitter, is under scrutiny for speaking on Friday at a white-nationalist conference headlined by Nick Fuentes, whom the Anti-Defamation League has described as a ""well-known white supremacist pundit and organizer.""

3/4/2022,"Amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a small portion of the defenders’ arsenal has had a disproportionate effect — Ukraine’s handful of Bayraktar TB2 armed drones. Videos of their exploits have millions of views. They’ve destroyed surface-to-air missile launchers and logistics trains. They’ve inspired songs and are a common refrain in videos taunting the Russian invaders. Despite their small number — around 20, according to pre-war comments made to Al-Monitor — the drones have been heavily utilized, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia, on the other hand, claims it has shot down some of the drones. Compilation of TB2 footage showing strikes on Russian military targets. Some of the footage was previously released. https://t.co/fCznAmZtiW pic.twitter.com/FSk5ilKBni — Rob Lee (@RALee85) March 1, 2022 According to Stijin Mitzer, an open-source intelligence analyst, the small Turkish-made drones have destroyed at least 32 Russian vehicles since war broke out last week, though it’s impossible to independently confirm the total number of vehicles they’ve destroyed. An expert on Russian drone warfare, Samuel Bendett of the CNA think tank, explained to Military Times that even the drones’ limited successes show that Russia is failing to implement its own air defense strategies. He added that Russia studied the lessons learned by Armenia in last year’s war with Azerbaijan, which saw the latter nation decimate Armenian positions and vehicles with Bayraktar drones and loitering munitions. Perhaps the “biggest lesson” of that conflict, Bendett said, was that slow, low flying drones like the Bayraktar are effective against outdated air defense systems. Russian planners were confident that their force structure, which prioritizes modernized, layered air defense, would be able to prevent such a massacre — but “we’re not seeing...what Russians have advertised,” Bendett said. Russian units are usually arrayed in battalion tactical groups, BTGs, with layered air defense and anti-drone capacity, said Bendett. But the forward elements of Russian forces have failed to operate as BTGs in Ukraine, frequently leaving behind their air defense assets “in inexplicable fashion,” he added. “[In Ukraine], Russia doesn’t seem to display the very tactics, techniques and procedures that it’s practiced for years and sought to perfect in Syria...[to provide] adequate cover to its ground forces,” he said. Bendett also pointed towards “the mythology of the Bayraktar” and how “Ukraine is winning the information war.” “For all the Russian military talk about winning information war, they seem to be losing, and the videos of Bayraktars striking what appears to be Russian targets is feeding into that [Ukrainian] information campaign,” he said. #Ukrainian Ground Forces shared a song written for #BayraktarTB2 on its official social media account with a note of ""Punishment of #Bayraktar in the name of #Ukrainian children, Georgians, Syrians, Chechens, and Crimean Tatars."" pic.twitter.com/4HlRxrxbtE — Clash Report (@clashreport) March 1, 2022 Bendett believes that the days of Bayraktar strikes are limited, though, should Russia reorganize its advance. “If the Russian military reorganizes — if it sends in the BTGs, if it sends in adequate air defense capability, if it sends in its [electronic warfare] forces...it would become increasingly more difficult for Bayraktars to operate in an uncontested fashion,” said the drone expert. “They were definitely aware of the threat. They definitely practiced against the threat.” And even should the Russians recover and counter the drone threat, he noted, “they were supposed to eliminate a lot of Ukrainian air defense capability from the...first hours of the campaign.” That includes the air bases where the drones are stored, fueled and equipped. A portion of that responsibility, according to other experts and U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters, lies with the conspicuous absence of the Russian Air Force over the skies of Ukraine. “The fact that there may be surviving [Bayraktars] somewhere is an embarrassment [to Russia],” said Bendett. “Clearly.”",World/Air Force Times,"Ukraine’s drone strikes reveal Russian planning failures, expert says",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-drone-strikes-reveal-russian-223151164.html
3/4/2022,"On Thursday the Marine Corps launched its first ever Marine littoral regiment ― a new unit that already may have the U.S.’s near-peer militaries worried. “Adversaries do not like this concept at all,” Gen. Eric Smith, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told reporters at a briefing on Monday. “They don’t like the fact that units are highly mobile, that they have a low signature, and that the adversary doesn’t know where these things are.” The new 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment will be headquartered out of Marine Corps Base Hawaii and is based around the current 3rd Marine Regiment. Designed based on potentially thousands of hours of war games, the new unit is set to the be the flagship formation seeing the Corps enter the post Global War on Terror era. Standup of Marine littoral regiment will usher new gear into Pacific theater But not everyone is sold on the new concept or buys the Marine Corps’ total confidence of the fear these units may strike in potential enemies. “It was as if they had entered the mind of our opponents,” Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and current senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told Marine Corps Times. “I think it would be more accurate to say, ‘In our war games the Chinese player finds it very difficult to track down these platoons,” Cancian said. The new littoral regiment will be made up of three elements: a littoral combat team ― consisting of one infantry battalion and one missile battery potentially capable of sinking ships, a littoral anti-air battalion and a combat logistics battalion. The littoral combat team will be capable of deploying in plus-sized platoon elements ranging from 75 to more than 100 Marines depending on the mission, Smith told reporters. The Marine Corps envisions using those teams to create and occupy expeditionary advanced bases widely dispersed across the littorals of any future fight. Those Marines will be able to launch cyberattacks, spot targets and possibly even sink or destroy large enemy ships. Despite the firepower, the Corps hopes the small size and the dispersed nature of the unit will keep it undetected from enemy sensors for an extended period of time, while the unit’s mobility will allow it to run away unscathed once the enemy does stumble upon it. Eventually the Corps will have three littoral regiments, all stationed within III Marine Expeditionary Force, Smith said on Monday. The Marine Corps has been experimenting with the formations and tactics the regiment will implore since the 2020 release of Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger’s Force Design 2030. Smith said it was those tests that have shown how worried the enemy is about the new Marine Corps formation. “We’re talking about an organization of 75 Marines … that are inherently mobile and have capabilities to shut down a network to strike an enemy capital warship and then fade away and move again,” Smith said. “Adversaries hate that because they don’t have effective control over the adversary’s plan.” Smith said he could not give details on how that information was gathered or assessed because it was classified. The Marine Corps’ hesitancy to publicly provide data about Force Design 2030 tests has caused some to be skeptical of the Corps’ assertion that potential adversaries are shaking in their boots. “The Marine Corps states that the war games support their concept and maybe they do, but it is not evident,” Cancian said. But not all are as pessimistic. Dakota Wood, a retired Marine and current senior research fellow for the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, told Marine Corps Times, “It’s not 100% guaranteed, but I think there’s been a lot of intellectual effort put into it.” “I think these newly derived solutions will be applicable against a range of tactical scenarios,” Wood said. Cancian agrees that the Marine Corps needs to modernize and shift its focus toward near-peer threats like China. But the retired Marine pointed out that this was the first major introduction in Marine Corps war fighting concepts during peace since helicopters were introduced between World War II and the Korean War. While the Corps has gone through significant changes since the late 1940s, most of those changes came out of weaknesses exposed on battlefields and almost immediately were tested in the fires of war. By contrast, Force Design 2030 has been developed and tested through simulations and field exercises that allow the Marine Corps to make its own assumptions about the enemy’s capabilities. “It’s very good that the Marine Corps is conducting them,” Cancian said. “It’s all very sensible, but nobody on the outside has any visibility into them.” Wood acknowledged it is possible for confirmation bias to make its way into the Marine Corps analysis process. He noted that it is important for the Marine Corps and outside observers to constantly question these studies and experiments to ensure they hold up. But from his vantage point, the Marine Corps seems to be heading in the right direction. Though he did not provide many details, Smith said the Corps is constantly listening to small unit leaders running Marines through these exercises to figure out what is working and what is not. “We are constantly adjusting the exact size of an infantry battalion, the exact number of missiles a unit needs to carry so that it matches our logistics capability, the exact signature that they will put out,” Smith said. “Those things are constantly in motion, but our cardinal direction has not changed at all and every piece of analysis that we have comes back and says, ‘The adversaries do not like what you’re doing at all,’” Smith said.",U.S./Defense News,Marine Corps launches new littoral unit that US adversaries reportedly hate,https://news.yahoo.com/marine-corps-launches-littoral-unit-233325024.html
