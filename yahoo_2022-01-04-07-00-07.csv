1/4/2022,"By Nancy Lapid    (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.    Coronavirus leaves survivors with self-attacking antibodies    Months after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, survivors have elevated levels of antibodies that can mistakenly attack their own organs and tissues, even if they had not been severely ill, according to new findings.    Among 177 healthcare workers who had recovered from confirmed coronavirus infections contracted before the availability of vaccines, all had persistent autoantibodies, including ones that can cause chronic inflammation and injury of the joints, skin and nervous system. ""We would not normally expect to see such a diverse array of autoantibodies elevated in these individuals or stay elevated for as long six months after full clinical recovery,"" said Susan Cheng of the Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute in Los Angeles. Patterns of elevated autoantibodies varied between men and women, the researchers reported on Thursday in the Journal of Translational Medicine .  Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School for Public Health, talks about a new South African study finding infection with the Omicron variant produces antibodies that work against the Delta variant.   ""We don't yet know how much longer, beyond six months, the antibodies will stay elevated and/or lead to any important clinical symptoms,"" Cheng said. ""It will be essential to monitor individuals moving forward."" Her team is investigating whether autoantibody elevations are linked with persistent symptoms in people with long COVID and planning to study autoantibody levels after infections with newer variants of the virus.    B cells' effects weakened but not defeated by Omicron    The effects of antibodies produced by the immune system's ""memory B cells"" against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, while weakened, could still be significant, researchers believe.    Once the body learns to recognize SARS-CoV-2, either after infection or vaccination, B cells generate fresh antibodies against the virus if there are not already enough antibodies circulating in the blood that can neutralize it. In a study reported on bioRxiv ahead of peer review, researchers analyzed the strength of more than 300 antibodies produced by memory B cells obtained from vaccinated volunteers, including some who had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.    ""Omicron seemed to evade a very large share of the memory B cells pool,"" researchers said, adding that it ""seems to still be efficiently recognized by 30% of total antibodies and close to 10% of all potent neutralizing antibodies,"" said Matthieu Mahevas and Pascal Chappert of Universite de Paris in a joint email. Memory B cells' robust ability to proliferate and produce antibodies might compensate ""in less than two days"" for those antibodies' reduced effectiveness, they speculate.    In combination with other immune system components, particularly T cells, the effects of B cells likely help to explain why most vaccinated individuals who become infected do not become sick enough to require hospitalization, they said.    Virus variants' activity in cells makes them more effective    Along with spike mutations that help the coronavirus break into cells, mutations that change how the virus behaves inside the cells are a big factor in why some variants have been more transmissible, researchers have discovered.    The findings, published in Nature, show that scientists ""have to start looking at mutations outside the spike,"" which has so far been the main focus of vaccines and antibody drugs, said Nevan Krogan of the University of California, San Francisco. Studying the Alpha variant, his team found a mutation at a non-spike site that causes infected cells to ramp up their production of a protein called Orf9B. Orf9b in turn disables a protein called TOM70 that cells use to send signals to the immune system. With higher levels of Orf9B disabling TOM70, the immune system does not respond as well and the virus can better evade detection, the researchers said.    Referring to the increase in Orf9B, Krogan said, ""It's rare that mutations 'turn up' a protein. It's a very sneaky thing for this virus to do."" The same mutation was identified on Delta, ""and sure enough, almost the same mutation is on Omicron,"" he said, which suggests they may have similar effects on the immune system. The new information could spur development of drugs that target the interaction of Orf9b and TOM70.    Click for a Reuters graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3c7R3Bl on vaccines in development.    (Reporting by Nancy Lapid; Editing by Bill Berkrot) ",Health/Reuters,"Virus leaves antibodies that may attack healthy tissues; B cell antibodies weakened, not defeated by Omicron",https://news.yahoo.com/virus-leaves-antibodies-may-attack-204240584.html
1/4/2022,"A “rabid Karen” was caught on video calling her “children” and telling them “this is your Asian family” during a racist rant in a Las Vegas hotel parking lot.

The video, posted by TikTok user @peachmegladon on Dec. 31, 2021, shows an unidentified woman getting physical with the person trying to film her after she allegedly assaulted them during a confrontation in the parking lot, The Daily Dot reported.
 


Although @peachmegladon did not provide details about the events prior to the filming of the video, the TikTok user wrote in their video’s caption that the woman attacked them twice.

“Rabid Karen was verbally harassing my mom and I at our hotel, calling us Asian b*****s who should [go] back to our country,” the video’s on-screen text reads. “Then she assaulted me twice trying to take my phone.”

The alleged assailant, who can be seen holding a wine glass, then exits into the parking lot. She takes out her phone and calls her child, who she claims to be Asian.

“This is your family. Your Asian family,” the woman says in the video. “This is your mother and father.” When asked by the victims what she is talking about, the woman suddenly screams, “My f*cking kids are Asian!”

The mother and daughter follow the woman around the parking lot and continue filming her. At one point during the confrontation, the unidentified assailant sits on a bench and asks them to get away from her. She starts yelling again when they refuse to leave her alone.

A man who is believed to be part of the hotel staff approaches the woman and asks what is going on, to which she replies, “I was just reading, and these guys are harassing me.”

“You need to leave me alone,” she continues saying to the mother and daughter. “I am done with this.” She then threatens to call “corporate.”

“I need you guys to leave me alone. My child is Asian,” she says before the video cuts off.

In the video’s comments section, @peachmegladon said the hotel was very helpful during the investigation of the incident; however, the woman in the video has yet to be identified.

“Our hotel was extremely helpful in looking into this,” the user wrote. “They were nice and said they do not tolerate this behavior as they reviewed their footage.”

The TikTok user also shared another video in which they can be heard requesting the employee who intervened to ask for the unidentified woman’s name. One user in the comment section pointed out that the employee did not fulfill his job when the mother and daughter asked for his help.

“Yes, that was a whole issue,” @peachmegladon wrote in their reply. “The security’s manager said he breached parts of his job in this incident.”

When asked if the man in the video knows the alleged assailant’s name, the user wrote, “Not sure,” adding that he “couldn’t even answer me yes or no if he ended up getting her name. Working with the hotel.”

The incident was re-shared by @auntkaren0, a popular TikTok channel with over 1.6 million followers that highlights similar encounters, to call out the woman in the video for her racist remarks.
    “Just because you adopt or have children that are Asian does not mean you are incapable of being racist,” @auntkaren0 said in the video.  Featured Image via @peachmegladon Enjoy this content?

1/4/2022,"Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump have refused to comply with subpoenas issued by the New York attorney general as part of an investigation into their father's business practices, ABC News reports. According to The New York Times, New York Attorney General Letitia James' civil inquiry ""is focused on whether Mr. Trump fraudulently inflated the value of his assets to secure bank loans and understated them elsewhere to reduce his tax bill."" James subpoenaed former President Donald Trump and his two oldest children on Dec. 1. The former president's involvement was made public within days, but the subpoenas targeting Donald Jr. and Ivanka first came to light in a court document released Monday. Donald Jr. helped run the Trump Organization during his father's presidency, while Ivanka worked in the West Wing as a presidential adviser. Both said they plan to file motions to quash the subpoenas. President Trump's younger son, Eric, was questioned by James' office in October 2020. Based on her findings, James has the authority to file a civil lawsuit but cannot pursue criminal charges — in other words, if any of the Trumps ever end up behind bars, it won't be over this. James is, however, also involved in a criminal tax-avoidance investigation into the Trump Organization led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. After receiving his subpoena last month, President Trump filed a lawsuit contending that James' investigation was ""guided solely by political animus."" The lawsuit, to which James' office has not yet responded in court, also claims that any testimony the former president gave in the civil inquiry might then be used against him in the criminal investigation, thus violating his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

1/4/2022,"A US Navy aircraft carrier deployed with a female skipper for the first time on Monday. USS Abraham Lincoln set sail from San Diego under the command of Capt. Amy Bauernschmidt. The carrier also set sail with the first Marine Corps F-35C stealth fighter squadron. Nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln made history Monday when it set sail from San Diego, becoming the first US Navy carrier to deploy under the leadership of a female commanding officer. Capt. Amy Bauernschmidt assumed command of the carrier in August, becoming the first female carrier skipper. Prior to taking command of the Lincoln last year, Bauernschmidt served as the commanding officer of the amphibious transport dock USS San Diego. She was previously the Lincoln's executive officer and the first woman to serve as the second-in-command on a carrier. Before that, Bauernschmidt, a seasoned helicopter pilot who has flown over 3,000 hours in Navy aircraft, commanded Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 70, supporting Operation Enduring Freedom while deployed aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush. When she took command of the Lincoln last summer, Bauernschmidt said in a statement that ""there is no more humbling sense of responsibility than to know you are entrusted with the care of the people who have chosen to protect our nation."" The Lincoln left San Diego Monday for a regular deployment as part of the Carrier Strike Group 3, which also included one guided-missile cruiser and four guided-missile destroyers. Beyond its commanding officer, the Lincoln also made history by deploying with the first Marine Corps F-35C Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter squadron, the ""Black Knights"" of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 314. The Lincoln is, however, not the first carrier to deploy with the F-35C. USS Carl Vinson deployed with the ""Argonauts"" of Strike Fighter Squadron 147 last August, becoming the first Navy carrier to sail with an integrated air wing consisting of both fourth- and fifth-generation fighters. Insider previously talked to one of the Marine F-35C pilots of VMFA 314. The pilot, Maj. Mark Dion, said that ""the jet brings a lot of capability to the Marine Corps and to the Navy"" and ""just makes the carrier much more lethal."" In its statement on the Lincoln's deployment, the Navy said that ""the Navy's next iteration of the Carrier Air Wing will be more lethal and survivable in today's contested battle space, and well into the future."" The Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group began preparing for this deployment last April and recently completed a month-long exercise to certify the strike group ahead of its deployment. The Navy did not provide any details on the CSG's deployment, only saying that it is in ""support of global maritime security operations.""

1/4/2022,"Former Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale just wanted some peanuts. He and his son sat through two quarters of Thursday’s Peach Bowl in Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, watching his alma mater, Pittsburgh, battle Michigan State and seeing ads for Georgia’s state crop. So when the third quarter rolled around, and the Panthers were nursing a 14-10 lead, DePasquale left his seat in search of peanuts. He checked every stand he came to on the concourse, looking past the hot dogs and nachos for that elusive bag of shelled goodness. Increase: Pa. Turnpike tolls go up. Here's what you'll be paying. Pa. governor's race: Here's everything you need to know about who's running in 2022 DePasquale, who lives in York County, was reading a menu board when he heard shouting. He said one man was telling another “you don’t want a piece of this.” The second man, wearing a Pitt shirt, replied with the warning that he would “(expletive) kill him.” There were dozens of people standing around. A couple of them tried to intervene. We know this because there is a video of the exchange. Two minutes of yelling, a few punches, one woman falling to the floor after being struck and no signs of security. That video has been viewed more than eight million times on Twitter. And DePasquale was right there in the middle of it, giving aid to the woman on the floor. The video shows the woman trying to calm the man in the Pitt shirt. The other man approached and appeared to blow him a kiss. At that point the first man threw a punch, connecting with the woman instead of the other man. As the woman dropped to the floor, a pair of men approached the man in the Pitt shirt, yelling “stop, just stop. Look at this, look what you did.” “I saw her get hit,” DePasquale said Monday. “It wasn’t the blow, it was the way her head hit the ground. I believe she was [hurt], but not seriously.” As DePasquale and another man checked on the woman, the men involved in the altercation were briefly separated. And then they weren’t. DePasquale found himself lying on the woman to protect her as the two men grappled beside and on top of him. “I got kneed and elbowed when I was lying on her,” he said. “I’m just thankful it didn’t get worse. A young guy, maybe 20 or 21, came up and asked what he could do. I told him to find a medic.” And that’s when DePasquale said it hit him that there seemed like 200 people were recording the action, but no one was helping. No one was calling security. DePasquale is heard on the video begging someone, anyone, to get security. “It was at least five minutes before security got there,” he said. “I went back to my seat. My son asked about the peanuts, and I described the situation and said there were no peanuts at any of the stands.” DePasquale said he didn’t know there was a video until he started to hear from friends who had seen it on Twitter. And people started to identify him in it. “Eight million views,” he said Monday morning with a chuckle. “I can’t get eight million views on a healthcare plan. I just wanted to enjoy New Year’s with my son.” And he wanted peanuts. And a Pitt win. He didn’t get either. Shelly Stallsmith is a trends reporter for the York Daily Record.

She called Trump's conduct on January 6 ""a dereliction of duty."" The House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot has ""firsthand testimony"" that former President Donald Trump watched the violence unfold on television instead of taking immediate action to stop the attack, Rep.

He could have told them to stand down. He could have told them to go home, and he failed to do so,"" she said. The January 6 committee also has firsthand testimony that members of Trump's staff, including his daughter and then-White House senior advisor, Ivanka Trump, ""went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence,"" Cheney said. Prior to the investigation's findings, several news reports last year highlighted that Trump watched the riot on television and did not take steps to intervene. Just five days after the riot, The Washington Post reported that Trump was glued to the TV screen as members of Congress locked down in the Capitol sought his help. Post reporter Carol Leonnig, co-author of the book ""I Alone Can Fix It,"" described Trump as ""almost giddy"" while he watched the riot on television.

1/4/2022,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) blamed the Biden administration for COVID-19 woes in his state while accusing other state leaders of allowing “hysteria” to reign as they encourage mitigation measures against the virus that he claimed had little basis in sound science. “In terms of Florida, you look what’s going on in other states, they’re letting hysteria drive them to doing really damaging things. We thought that people had learned,” DeSantis said during his first news conference in weeks on Monday after record-setting COVID-19 numbers spread across the state last month. “They’re closing schools, they’re doing things that should not be done. That is not the way you deal with this.” DeSantis, who has routinely promoted monoclonal antibodies since former President Donald Trump credited the treatment for his recovery, said his administration was worried about dwindling supplies, even as several of the approved treatments appear to be less effective in fighting off Omicron. “We were concerned about what was happening with the taking back of the supply—even more so than has been—of monoclonal antibodies,” DeSantis said. “It’s something that we actually have seen applied with Omicron patients and we have seen symptoms resolved.” The treatments had become a critical weapon in warding off hospitalization in high-risk infections, but some hospitals in recent weeks had begun cutting back the treatments as growing evidence suggested that two of the three monoclonal antibody treatments they had relied on to provide relief against past variants, do not offer the same shield against severe illness against the highly contagious new Omicron strain. DeSantis claimed on Monday that the administration’s initial decision to pause shipments of Regeneron and the Eli Lilly treatments, had been based on what he called “some preliminary study” suggesting that they might not be as effective against Omicron. “But Omicron isn’t the only variant out there,” he said. Please Take a Moment From Your Vacation, Ron DeSantis, and Reassure Florida Last week, the state’s Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo issued a letter that ripped the Department of Health and Human Services for “actively preventing the effective distribution” of monoclonal antibody treatments even as the administration began allocating doses of sotrovimab, a treatment which appears to continue to be effective against the Omicron variant. Ladapo on Monday also said he hoped to “unwind the testing mentality the federal government has gotten us into over the last two years,” after Florida reported more than 298,000 new COVID-19 cases last week and a test positivity rate of 26.5 percent. “It’s important people are making decisions they want about vaccinations, and enjoy the fact that many people have natural immunity,” he said. Although there has been some debate over just how many of the overwhelming number of new cases can be attributed to the Omicron variant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the troubling new strain accounted for roughly 58.6 percent of new cases in the United States for the week concluding on Christmas. Adjusting its position on the paused shipments last week, HHS said that clinical guidelines published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on Dec. 30, 2021, indicated “significant variability in prevalence” of the Omicron variant and opted to allow states to continue ordering both products. The Broward Health Medical Center news conference marked the governor’s first public event since he was criticized for appearing at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on New Year’s Eve for the Orange Bowl weeks after a crush of new infections fueled by the Omicron variant clobbered the state. DeSantis, who established a national profile as a leading opponent against various coronavirus-related mitigation measures, also blamed the CDC for “bad policy” on quarantining healthy kids that kept some students from attending school as cases cropped up in classrooms. The governor insisted—despite ample evidence to the contrary—that masks were largely ineffective and that kids “do not need to be doing any crazy mitigation.” “Just let them be kids,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear, a lot of this mitigation, it hasn’t worked period.” DeSantis drilled down on masks in particular, shredding Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts, who have continued to defend their use claiming that “it’s not ultimately really sound science.” “You even see some of these TV doctors on CNN admitting that cloth masks are not going to stop—protect against Omicron,” DeSantis said. “Simply putting cloth over and thinking that somehow that is going to provide good protection, that’s just not accurate.” The comments appeared to refer to an effort by CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen urging Americans to upgrade their masks in light of Omicron’s transmissibility. “We need to be wearing at least a three-ply surgical mask,” Wen told the network, adding that scientists have been pushing for the widespread use of face coverings which are better at keeping out tiny particles for months. “You can wear a cloth mask on top of that, but do not just wear a cloth mask alone.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/4/2022,"A Louisiana man who has served 47 years in prison remains incarcerated nearly nine months after his parole date and following two court decisions ordering his release. The Louisiana Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole voted unanimously on March 18 to release Bobby Sneed from Angola prison. Sneed collapsed on March 25, four days before his scheduled release, and tested positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine, prison authorities claimed. He was held past his release date for a disciplinary hearing, but the disciplinary committee dropped the drug use allegations because it could not confirm that the urine sample used to accuse the 75-year-old was his. By Nov. 9 authorities at the Louisiana State Prison in Angola, Louisiana, had accused Sneed of a fresh drug charge, saying the prisoner had been found unresponsive with “one eyedropper containing unknown liquid substance inside the bottle,” a liquid they later said was PCP. Following this, he was found guilty at a disciplinary hearing of possession of a controlled substance and sentenced to one day in solitary confinement. Both the charges from March and the November charge have been dropped by the prison disciplinary board, and by Dec. 9 a district judge issued his second ruling ordering Sneed’s release. While waiting by the gate to be picked up on Dec. 10, Sneed was rearrested and sent to a nearby jail. Although the judge had ordered his release the day before, which followed another on Nov. 18, the parole board engineered a way to keep Sneed incarcerated despite the rulings in his favor, including its own vote. During his brief release, the board issued an arrest warrant for parole violation, arguing that the two drug accusations against Sneed this year violated his parole — even though he was still incarcerated and not actually paroled. “This latest illegal and retaliatory move by the Board of Parole—yet another foul blow in their Javert-like pursuit of Mr. Sneed—is an effort to prolong Mr. Sneed’s unconstitutional detention,” Sneed’s lawyer, Thomas Frampton, wrote in a federal court filing in response to his rearrest. Sneed has served 47 years in prison for his role in a fatal robbery in 1974. Sneed was a lookout and was not present during the killing, but was convicted of principal to commit second-degree murder because he was involved in the crime that led to the murder. He was sentenced to life in prison. In mid-March, the parole panel decided Sneed was no longer a threat to society. He suffered a stroke in 2005 and had to be rehabilitated. “I don’t believe that there’s any threat to public safety….By keeping him incarcerated, at his age and with [his] medical conditions, it’s more costly with very finite taxpayer dollars to keep him [locked up] than to help him get substance abuse treatment,” Kerry Myers, deputy director of the Louisiana Parole Project, told Reason.com. “What’s at stake is: What’s the best use of resources?” Although the disciplinary committee cleared him for the positive urine sample, the parole board voted to revoke Sneed’s parole in May. However, a judge later ruled that the parole board did not afford Sneed the due process he was warranted to receive in a parole revocation hearing. Neither Sneed nor his lawyers saw the evidence against him or got to cross-examine or call any witnesses during the hearing. “Because it is undisputed that no such procedures were followed when Mr. Sneed’s parole was stripped…this Court finds that [he] was deprived … of due process of law,” wrote Judge Ron Johnson of the 19th Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge Parish. Only one member of the parole committee signed the warrant that was issued based on a write-up Sneed received on Nov. 9, when he was found unresponsive and allegedly in possession of an eyedropper containing PCP. While Sneed’s fate remains in limbo, state and federal lawsuits are pending on each side. The Louisiana Supreme Court on Dec. 16 ruled that the lower court was wrong to order Sneed released on parole. The Supreme Court contended that the district court should have sent the case to the parole committee for a revocation hearing. Frampton filed a federal motion to hold the state officials in contempt. He claims that Sneed could not have violated his parole because he was still incarcerated and not on parole.

1/4/2022,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday rejected U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry’s attempts to dismiss charges accusing the Nebraska Republican of making false statements to FBI agents who were investigating an illegal foreign donation to his campaign. U.S. District Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. denied Fortenberry's motions to get the case tossed, increasing the odds that he will have to stand trial in a Los Angeles federal court. Fortenberry is accused of lying to the FBI and concealing information from agents who were looking into a donation his campaign received from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent. Chagoury made the $30,000 contribution through a middleman at a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles. Agents interviewed Fortenberry twice, and prosecutors allege that the nine-term Congressman falsely told them he was unaware that the donation had come from an illegal foreign source and that he had properly disclosed all of his campaign donations. Prosecutors allege that Fortenberry was warned in a phone call that the donation was illegal and that he didn't properly disclose them in his campaign filings. Fortenberry was first elected to Nebraska's heavily Republican 1st Congressional District in 2004 and he has easily defeated his Democratic challengers over the years. Some Democrats argue that the indictment makes him more vulnerable in the district, which includes left-leaning Lincoln as well as surrounding farmland and more conservative small towns in eastern Nebraska. Fortenberry’s attorneys sought to have the charges dismissed on the grounds that the congressman made the statements to agents at his home in Lincoln and in Washington D.C., and not in the California judicial district where he's charged. Blumenfeld on Monday denied that motion, ruling that Fortenberry's alleged statements were tied to the federal investigation in Los Angeles. “Because Defendant’s allegedly false statements were directed at federal investigative efforts occurring in this district, the Court finds that venue is proper in the Central District of California,” the judge wrote. Blumenfeld rejected Fortenberry's arguments that his statements didn't have any effect on the federal investigation, and the congressman's claims that he didn't have a legal duty to disclose the allegedly concealed information. He also rejected Fortenberry's claims that prosecutors had concocted multiple charges from a single alleged offense. Blumenfeld also denied Fortenberry's motion to disqualify a prosecutor from the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mack Jenkins. Fortenberry's attorneys have said they wanted to call him as a witness, and they believe Jenkins misled Fortenberry's previous lawyer into thinking that authorities wanted to interview Fortenberry as a potential witness, not as a target of their investigation. Fortenberry still has a motion pending to try to suppress statements he made to investigators. A court hearing is set for Jan. 11. His trial is scheduled to start Feb. 15, but it has already been postponed several times. Campaign spokesman Chad Kolton said Fortenberry will continue to fight the charges. “This case still has enormous flaws, which have existed from the earliest days of the investigation and remain even after today’s decision,"" Kolton said. ""Mr. Fortenberry has always had great faith in the American people’s ability to judge what is fair and just. Nebraskans will see this case clearly for what it is: a California prosecutor’s attempt to use deceptive investigative tactics to set up a widely respected member of Congress.” ___ Follow Grant Schulte on Twitter: https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte",U.S./Associated Press,Judge denies Rep.

1/4/2022,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA’s new space telescope is on the verge of completing the riskiest part of its mission — unfolding and tightening a huge sunshade — after ground controllers fixed a pair of problems, officials said Monday.  The tennis court-size sunshield on the James Webb Space Telescope is now fully open and in the process of being stretched tight. The operation should be complete by Wednesday. The $10 billion telescope — the largest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever launched — rocketed away Christmas Day from French Guiana. Its sunshield and primary mirror had to be folded to fit into the European Ariane rocket. The sunshield is vital for keeping Webb's infrared-sensing instruments at subzero temperatures, as they scan the universe for the first stars and galaxies, and examine the atmospheres of alien worlds for possible signs of life. Getting the sunshield extended last Friday ""was really a huge achievement for us,"" said project manager Bill Ochs. All 107 release pins opened properly. But there have been a few obstacles. Flight controllers in Maryland had to reset Webb’s solar panel to draw more power. The observatory — considered the successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope — was never in any danger, with a constant power flow, said Amy Lo, a lead engineer for the telescope's prime contractor, Northrop Grumman. They also repointed the telescope to limit sunlight on six overheating motors. The motors cooled enough to begin securing the sunshield, a three-day process that can be halted if the problem crops up again, officials said. “Everything is hunky-dory and doing well now,” Lo said.  Ochs expects the tightening of the sunshield to be drama-free.  “The best thing for operations is boring, and that’s what we anticipate over the next three days, is to be boring,"" he told reporters in a teleconference. If that holds true, the telescope's gold-plated mirror — more than 21 feet (6.5 meters) across — could unfold as soon as this weekend. Webb should reach its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away by the end of January. As of Monday, the telescope was more than halfway there. The infrared telescope should begin observing the cosmos by the end of June, ultimately unveiling the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe 13.7 billion years ago. That's a mere 100 million years after the universe-creating Big Bang. Launched in 1990, Hubble, which sees primarily visible light, has peered as far back as 13.4 billion years ago. Astronomers hope to close the gap with Webb, which is 100 times more powerful. In another bit of good news Monday, officials said they expect Webb to last well beyond the originally anticipated 10 years based on its fuel efficiency. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
