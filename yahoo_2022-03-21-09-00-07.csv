3/21/2022,"The People’s Convoy got a taste of its own medicine on Saturday afternoon in Washington, D.C., when a single bicyclist moving at a snail’s pace brought the truckers to a near halt by occupying an entire lane of traffic in front of them. “Hey, what are you doing? You have a bunch of trucks behind you,” a convoy live streamer and YouTuber WYSIWYGTV (pronounced “whizzy-wick”) yelled at the unidentified cyclist while confronting him. “You got a bunch of trucks behind us.” The biker then trolled in response: “What’s that? I didn’t hear you... I didn’t hear you, what did you say?” After the streamer snapped back, “You have a bunch of trucks behind you,” the cyclist replied: “I’m sorry, I can’t hear you—it’s too loud.” The cyclist continued to ride in front of the truckers at a plodding pace, unmoved by the line of honking big rigs behind him. The farcical moment came as the right-wing trucker convoy enters their third week of repeatedly attempting and failing to cause mayhem in the Beltway area. On Saturday afternoon, The Daily Beast reported that some of the anti-vaccine mandate truckers boxed in a white Tesla driven by someone who had allegedly been antagonistic towards the convoy. The incident was captured on a livestream by “Sasnak,” a lead convoy participant. “A Tesla pulled in...slammed the brakes on real hard and caused a brake-check,” the YouTuber declared, adding that his fellow truckers then brought the car to a standstill. Sasnak then turned on his fellow truckers for their actions towards the Tesla driver. “That’s illegal. You can’t do that. You can’t block somebody in like that,” the trucker said. “That’s considered abduction. The person in the car has the right to go bang bang and shoot you!” Sasnak did not return a Daily Beast request for comment on the incident. But on Sunday afternoon, during a YouTube stream, he added: “Talked it thought with a few of them. One guy is still mad at me.” A Maryland State Police official told The Daily Beast late Saturday evening that “no abduction occurred” on the interstate. “Abduction and boxing a car in and road rage are two different things,” the official added. By Sunday’s morning meeting, the convoy turned their focus to their absent leader Brian Brase, who had taken the weekend off to visit with family back home in Northwest Ohio—a move that left his fellow truckers confounded. While camped for weeks at the Hagerstown Speedway, the convoy has continued to make daily treks on the Beltway and more recently into D.C. proper. The truckers have seemingly struggled to navigate downtown city traffic, however, often getting split up by red lights. The group has been met with jeering inside the city from both pedestrians and commuters alike, whom the convoy has taken to labeling “antifa.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

The 12-foot-by-28-foot cabin was last seen between Nov. 18 and Dec. 16 set on County Road 571 in Coldsprings Township, also in Kalkaska County. When the cabin was reported stolen, Trooper Matthew Scott, who was investigating the case told the Free Press then the cabin's owner, lived in it for a couple of years until he left it to take up residence somewhere else, recently reported the 12-foot-by-28-foot structure missing, but he's unsure what happened to it or why anyone would want to steal it. Two suspects are believed to be involved with the theft, according to reports, and the case is still being investigated. Staff writer Frank Witsil contributed to this report.

3/21/2022,"WASHINGTON – Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas has been hospitalized for the past two days and is being treated for an infection, court officials said Sunday. Thomas, the most senior associate justice on the high court, is being treated with intravenous antibiotics, the court said, and his symptoms are improving. The Supreme Court said Thomas was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., on Friday after experiencing flu-like symptoms. Court officials said Thomas expects to be released in a day or two. 30 years: Thomas celebrates three decades on a court moving in his direction President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas in 1991 to fill the seat that had been held by Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall. Thomas, who is 73 and the only African American on the Supreme Court, was previously a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several of the justices have had health run-ins during this term, mainly due to the coronavirus pandemic. Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh tested positive for COVID-19 days before the justices returned to the courtroom in the fall. In November, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch called in sick with a stomach bug. The extent of Thomas' symptoms was not clear. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Monday. Court officials said Thomas intends to take part in considering cases through court records and recordings of oral argument for the days he cannot be there in person or remotely. Thomas, a stalwart of the court's conservative wing, celebrated his 30-year anniversary on the Supreme Court last fall. His supporters say that the 6-3 advantage conservatives now enjoy on the court has meant the high court is just beginning to catch up with some of his positions on guns, abortion and other hot-button issues. Already one of the longest-serving justices in history, and one of its most prolific, Thomas has also become more vocal in the past few years. He abandoned his penchant for silence during oral argument when the justices switched to virtual sittings because of the pandemic and he has continued to speak up with probing questions after they returned to in-person arguments in the courtroom last year. Today, Thomas is often the first justice to jump in with a question at argument. Thomas was raised by his grandparents in the Jim Crow South of the 1950s. He told an audience at Harvard Law School in 2013 that his childhood// friends and neighbors were ""not lettered people"" but ""treasured education in a way that a person who was hungry would treasure food.""
