2/9/2022,"Claims that another Chinese tech worker has died after excessive overtime has reignited debate over the industry’s “996 culture”. The company denied that it overworked the employee, but said it would pay more attention to the health of its employees. The 25-year-old reportedly died in hospital soon after he was taken to hospital from his home on Saturday afternoon. The video platform Bilibili, where the man was employed as a content auditor, said company representatives went to the hospital to assist and then notified his family.  Bilibili released an internal memo rejecting claims the employee – who reportedly died of a brain haemorrhage – was overworked. It said the man had worked from 9.30am to 6.30pm for the past week, with no overtime. But reports of his death by a workplace blogger on Monday renewed heated discussion about a toxic overtime culture dubbed “996” – referring to an expectation that employees, especially in the tech industry, work from 9am to 9pm six days a week. The expectation has in the past been promoted by high-profile figures including the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma. A hashtag related to the man’s death and including the allegation of overwork trended on Weibo, receiving hundreds of millions of views, including accusations the government had not done enough to address the problems in the year since a spate of high-profile deaths linked to overwork in 2020. “Don’t work hard regardless of the cost. There will be no impact on the company without you. But if you are gone, your mother will have nothing,” one Weibo user commented. “The main reason is the government has been ignoring this. It is quite normal for big companies employees to work for 12 hours,” another said. It also prompted posts by people who said they worked for the company claiming they had worked 12-hour overnight shifts across last week’s lunar new year holiday. Others claimed they found it difficult to claim back accumulated leave before it expired. “At Bilibili, even if you have annual days off, they wouldn’t really let you go. And there is no pay for overwork,” said one. Another added: “Our work intensity is like this: if you work the night shift, it is from 9pm to 9am. Bilibili requires us to work during the spring festival. A lot of people have left.” Bilibili’s statement had urged people to pay attention to their health, and use paid sick leave or communicate with supervisors if they felt unwell. It said it had established a company team to cooperate with police inquiries and to assist the family. Following extensive online discussion, Bilibili released a second statement, saying its senior executives had consulted with the man’s family and would make company changes. “First, the company will make the greatest efforts to expand the recruitment of auditors, and recruit 1,000 more people this year. Second, the company will pay more attention to the physical health of employees,” it said, listing increased physical examinations and the establishment of an onsite mental and physical health clinic.

2/9/2022,"Labor will move substantial amendments to the religious discrimination bill but pass it in the House of Representatives, setting up a potential Senate standoff with the government over protection of LGBTQ+ students and statements of belief. The Labor caucus agreed on Wednesday not to oppose the bill in the lower house despite a push from MP Josh Burns and at least a dozen others who wanted to vote against it if changes to prevent discrimination on other grounds are not made.  Labor and several of the government’s own members have been galvanised by the Morrison government revealing it will protect gay students from expulsion – but not other forms of discrimination – without protecting trans students at the same time. Labor is confident that it can make changes in the Senate to protect LGBTQ+ students and neuter the controversial statement of belief clause, which protects religious statements even if they offend, insult or humiliate others on the basis of protected attributes. The opposition has resolved to “insist” on any successful amendments until Liberal MPs help pass them in the lower house or Scott Morrison withdraws the bill. But the leader, Anthony Albanese, indicated a further caucus meeting could reconsider in the event of such an impasse, meaning Labor reserves its right to pass the bill before the 2022 election. The government faces growing opposition in the lower house to the bill, with Liberal Bridget Archer, independent Helen Haines and Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie indicating they do not support it in its current form, and Liberal Trent Zimmerman reserving his position. Labor caucus agreed to seek amendments in both houses to: Protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination by religious schools on the grounds of sexuality or gender. Amend the statements of belief clause to preserve existing rights against discrimination, including preventing it overriding state laws. Ban vilification on the grounds of religion. Prohibit discrimination in provision of in-home aged care services. Labor MPs largely agreed on the potential improvements to the bill, but differed on the procedural decision about whether to pass the bill in the lower house. Burns’ motion to oppose the bill in the lower house, if amendments are unsuccessful, was supported by a large group of MPs including Alicia Payne, Ged Kearney, Peter Khalil, Brian Mitchell, Peta Murphy and Kate Thwaites, but was defeated on the voices. The shadow cabinet, including Chris Bowen, and MPs Julian Hill and Stephen Jones spoke in favour of passing the bill in the House, expressing concerns that voting the bill down would give Scott Morrison a political wedge to campaign on and that hastening the bill to the Senate could speed up amendments to improve protections. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said Labor “supports the extension of the federal anti-discrimination framework to ensure that Australians are not discriminated against because of their religious beliefs or activities”. Dreyfus said the bill had “some big flaws that Labor will seek to change through amendments in the parliament, and, if we are unsuccessful, in government”. “If any of our amendments are successful in either the House or the Senate we will insist on them.” Labor will move amendments to remove discrimination in the Religious Discrimination Bill in the House. If they don’t get up we will move them in the Senate.If that fails we commit to removing discrimination if Labor wins the May election. Dreyfus said Labor also supported “removing discrimination against teachers while recognising the right of religious schools to give preference to hiring school staff of their own faith”. No immediate amendments were promised for teachers, as Dreyfus indicated Labor would seek to legislate in government after the Australian Law Reform Commission review. BREAKING: Labor will change the law to protect schoolkids and school staff from discrimination. The religious discrimination bill debate continues in the House of Representatives, with a vote expected as early as Wednesday evening. The government has a narrow window if it wishes to pass the bill in this sitting, with the Senate occupied by estimates hearings next week, and only a few days in the March budget sitting before a May election. On Wednesday Sharkie told the lower house she could not support the bill which would “privilege some” while causing “a number of disadvantages to others” including women, people with disabilities, LGTBQ+ people, and those relying on other anti-discrimination laws. Sharkie noted the bill would allow religious institutions to “take secular dollars and create an exclusive club on the grounds of religious belief” by discriminating against staff on the basis of faith.

Haines said she was particularly concerned about the statement of belief clause, which she called a “monumental steam-roll of our anti-discrimination laws”. Haines committed to “reassess this bill if it comes to the House in a better form” after Senate amendment, but warned “it will take a lot” to win her support. Haines said the government amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act do not provide enough protection for LGBTQ+ teachers and students, because religious schools would still “proactively” be able to discriminate with the exception of expelling gay students. The Greens have already promised wider changes including: immediately banning discrimination against LGBTQ+ school staff and students; removing the statement of belief clause; and removing the Folau-lite clause that prevents bodies that give employment qualifications from setting codes of practice banning inappropriate religious speech.",News/Australia news,Labor to seek protections for LGBTQ+ students but will pass religious discrimination bill in lower house,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/labor-to-seek-protections-for-lgbtq-students-but-will-pass-religious-discrimination-bill-in-lower-house
2/9/2022,"The nomination of Jane Campion for best director at the 2022 Academy Awards – her second, following her 1994 nomination for The Piano – is more noteworthy for what it says about the institution than for its validation of the 67-year-old director, absent from feature film-making for more than a decade. To date, only two women – Kathryn Bigelow and Chloé Zhao – have ever won best director. If that sounds unreasonable, consider this: in 93 years, just seven women have even been nominated for the award – Lina Wertmüller in 1977 (for Seven Beauties), Campion in 1994, Sofia Coppola in 2003 (for Lost in Translation), Bigelow in 2010 (for The Hurt Locker), Greta Gerwig in 2018 (for Lady Bird), Emerald Fennell in 2021 (for Promising Young Woman) and Zhao that same year, victorious with Nomadland. For the first half-century of the awards, double-X chromosomes and the ability to successfully oversee a motion picture were apparently believed to be irreconcilable. (Something to consider the next time the rightwing media complains about Hollywood’s liberal bias.)  Yet Campion owes her career to Europe, not the US. Unusually for an Anglophone film-maker, she’s very much a creation of the Cannes film festival. Championed by one of its scouts, the late Pierre Rissient, and enthusiastically welcomed by former festival director Gilles Jacob, her first short film, Peel, premiered there in 1982 and won the short film Palme d’Or. Two further shorts, Passionless Moments (1983) and A Girl’s Own Story (1984), each screened in the festival’s Un Certain Regard section, and by 1989, she’d graduated to Competition with her debut feature, Sweetie. Just four years later, she became the first female film-maker to win the Palme d’Or, for The Piano. In 2014 Campion was invited to chair the festival’s jury, and at that year’s closing ceremony, when the then-83-year-old Jacob presented the award for the Camera d’Or, he invited her to stand beside him at the podium. “Jane,” he said quietly, “you know what you mean to me.” This could seem anecdotal, but what Cannes did with that early endorsement proved foundational in two ways. Firstly, it bolstered Campion’s faith in her own artistic sensibility. “When I went to Cannes,” she told Richard Peña, program director for the Film Society of Lincoln Center. “I thought, ‘Oh, I can go on doing this.’” And secondly, it helped reintroduce antipodean cinema to the wider world, giving it a profile lacking since the early-70s heyday of the Australian New Wave. That she was a woman in what was then (and many would argue, still remains) a male-dominated enclave, only added to her mysterious sense of otherness. It’s worth noting that when she did win the Palme d’Or – which she shared with Chen Kaige for Farewell My Concubine – she was one of only two women among the 23 film-makers in Competition. (The other, oddly enough, was another Australian: the now much-missed Laurie McInnes.) Campion has, in short, had to fight for a seat at the table. Yet somehow she has managed to achieve it without sacrificing any of the qualities that make her unique. It’s all too easy, in all this reverent talk of her achievements, to overlook what a genuinely odd film-maker Campion is. Her fascination with aberrant behaviour, with the tactility of objects, with fetishistic tokens, is entirely her own. Hers is an unabashedly sensual cinema, impressionistic and frequently ambiguous – and the results are rewarding and frustrating in equal measures. Hollywood and Campion, therefore, were always going to be a difficult match. And after meeting the industry very much on her own terms with The Piano, she then attempted, with various degrees of success, to conform to the template of Respected Commercial Film-maker. Her 1996 film The Portrait of a Lady, based on one of Henry James’ best-loved novels and boasting some A-list stars (Nicole Kidman, John Malkovich, John Gielgud), looked at face value to be a classy high-lit adaptation à la Howard’s End or The Age of Innocence. In fact, it was a feverish deconstruction, almost postmodern in its treatment of character and incident. Some of it worked, much of it didn’t – but the sheer audacity of her approach is hard to deny. In the Cut, made seven years later, was even stranger. Adapting an erotic thriller by Susanna Moore, Campion twisted the material into ever-more-unconventional shapes, abstracting the narrative and ignoring genre conventions in order to better interrogate power dynamics in heterosexual relationships, and examine the sometimes murky nature of consent. The result, however, delighted almost no one – watching, you get the sense that she considered herself better than the material – and its commercial and critical failure marked the end of her initial flirtation with Hollywood. On the face of it, The Power of the Dog looks like an outlier in her filmography: an American sort-of western (never mind that it was shot in her native New Zealand) and her first film with male protagonists. In fact, it feels entirely congruent with the others. Campion’s worldview is reflexively feminist, however much she might deny the affiliation (“I dislike club mentality of any kind, even feminism,” she told director Katherine Dieckmann back in 2012, “though I do relate to the purpose and point of feminism”), yet she specialises in creating distinctly anti-feminist worlds for her characters to inhabit. Early colonial New Zealand, 1880s Rome, rural Montana in the 1920s … none of these milieus are exactly sympathetic to the cause of gender equality. Nevertheless, Campion’s heroines – and her (anti-)heroes – occupy them, and attempt by way of design and simple persistence to bend them to their will. One can hardly put much faith in the Oscars to get things right: this is, after all, the august body that pronounced Green Book the finest film of 2018. And the best director category remains very much a lottery: that Kenneth Branagh should be nominated for Belfast while first-timer Maggie Gyllenhaal goes unrewarded for The Lost Daughter (in my opinion, a better film than The Power of the Dog, and an even stronger display of directorial prowess) seems to me little short of science-fictional. But whatever the result on 27 March, the tide has turned. There’s no shortage of gifted female film-makers working right now, in the US, Europe, across Latin America and the Middle East. And one way or another, they all owe Campion a debt. The door was closed for too long, and she – talented and raw-nerved, impatient with conventional pieties – helped kick it open.",Arts/Film,Jane Campion: the uncompromising New Zealander kicking down doors in Hollywood,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/09/jane-campion-the-uncompromising-new-zealander-kicking-down-doors-in-hollywood
