2/17/2022,"Good morning. The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is considering subpoenaing Ivanka Trump after she appeared to refuse a request for voluntary cooperation, according to a source close to the matter.  Subpoenaing the former president’s daughter would mark a dramatic intensification in the investigation; so far, no members of Donald Trump’s family have been forced to testify against him. Ivanka Trump is thought to be important to the probe: she was close to Trump in the days before the Capitol attack, the chairman of the select committee, Bennie Thompson said, and appeared to have learned that the plan to have the then vice-president, Mike Pence, refuse to certify Joe Biden’s election win was potentially illegal. Is the panel likely to do it? The fact that committee members are discussing a subpoena suggests they believe it may be required to get her to appear at a deposition. When could it happen? The panel is not expected to take the step just yet – they want to give Trump a reasonable period of time to decide to engage voluntarily. Two of the three white men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery repeatedly used racial slurs, including violent comments, in messages and social media posts, an FBI analyst has testified. Text messages between Travis McMichael and William “Roddie” Bryan and others in the months and years before Arbery’s murder were shown to the jury of the federal hate crimes trial. The FBI was unable to access the phone of Greg McMichael, Travis McMichael’s father, because it was encrypted, said the analyst, Amy Vaughan. In several social media posts, Travis McMichael, 36, discussed violence against Black people and frequently used the N-word in conversations with friends. Bryan also used the N-word and made other racist comments. Was racism considered in the state trial? No – prosecutors sought only to prove the men were responsible for Arbery’s death, regardless of motive. What does the defence say? They insist the deadly pursuit of Arbery was motivated by a genuine, though erroneous, suspicion that Arbery had committed crimes. A six-year-old girl who went missing two years ago has been found alive and in good health in a makeshift room beneath a staircase in a house in New York state, according to police. Officers suspect she was abducted by her birth parents, who did not have custody. Two years after she went missing from Spencer, New York, Paislee Shultis was found on Monday in her grandfather’s house in the town of Saugerties, about 180 miles away. Police arrested her parents, Kimberly Cooper, 33, and Kirk Shultis Jr, 32, and her grandfather Kirk Shultis, 57. The child has been returned to her legal guardian. How did they find her? Police received a tip about the child’s location and obtained a search warrant. Had police spoken to the biological parents? Police said they interviewed Kirk Shultis Jr several times after Paislee went missing, who said that he had no knowledge of her location.

2/17/2022,"As news broke recently that the Covid vaccine for children under five would be delayed in the US amid ongoing clinical trials, a call to make the vaccines off-label for use among those children gained force – but officials caution against vaccinating young children without any safety or efficacy data for this age group.  When providers sign an agreement to provide Covid-19 vaccine shots, they also agree not to give the vaccine off-label, or use it for purposes other than what it was approved to do. In this case, the Moderna vaccine is approved for adults aged 18 and up, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved for those aged 16 and up. But the vaccines are still under emergency use authorizations for younger patients. Providers who give off-label vaccinations in the US may not be protected by legislation that keeps them from being held liable in the case of a rare adverse event. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned last summer against providing the vaccine off-label for kids under 12, though that guidance does not seem to be available now on the CDC’s page answering common questions about vaccinations. (The CDC did not respond to requests for comment.) The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also spoke out against off-label use of the emergency vaccines. Offering the vaccine to children under five is illegal, “and that dose has not been studied in kids under five”, Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist and vice-chair of the AAP’s committee on infectious diseases, said in an email. “If providers were to give it to these children, they could lose their status as a vaccine provider,” he said. The 10-microgram dose authorized for kids five to 11 has not been tested among younger kids, who received a 3 mg dose in the Pfizer/BioNTech pediatric trial. It’s possible that the dose intended for older children is more likely to cause side effects in younger children, O’Leary said. And if a serious side effect were to occur in a younger child, medical expenses might not be covered under the current vaccination compensation program. Also, “as a parent, I’d feel terrible. The risk of that is almost certainly quite low, but something to consider”, he said. “As much as I want a vaccine for these younger kids, I think it’s very important to follow the process as it’s designed, as that process has given us many safe, effective vaccines over the decades.” However, some families and physicians are pushing to change these rules, arguing that the clinical trials demonstrate the safety of the 3 mg dose in young children, and millions of children over five have been safely vaccinated. “I don’t see a difference in a child four years and five years, except for the age – the immune system works the same,” said Dr Wolfgang von Meissner, a family doctor in Germany. “I don’t see why I shouldn’t protect little kids.” Some vaccines – for instance, in kids who might be too young to get them before traveling abroad – and treatments, like certain antibiotics, are given to kids off-label based on a physician’s judgment and with parental consent. “In pediatrics in particular, off-label use of various kinds of medicines is pretty common,” Govind Persad, assistant professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, said. “Often you have medications – it’s mostly been vaccines – that seem like they might be beneficial, but there haven’t been pediatric trials.” In November 2021, several states began recommending boosters for all adults before the CDC and FDA changed guidelines, and in San Francisco, third shots are now available for those who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccines. This, too, is off-label use. But off-label use of unapproved vaccines is never allowed, Yvonne Maldonado, professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford University and chair of the AAP’s committee on infectious diseases, pointed out in an email, and the Covid vaccines for children still fall under this category. She said that she is strongly against the use of off-label vaccines. In Germany, where the Covid vaccines are not recommended for children under five but no restrictions against off-label use exist, von Meissner has been giving children Covid vaccinations since April 2021, beginning with children under 12 who were not yet eligible for the vaccines. He has given 2,500 vaccines to kids between the ages of six months and five years old. He emphasized the importance of informed consent for parents in off-label uses, especially given potential liability issues. “They need to understand, and then they need to make the decision.” He sees the vaccines as particularly important since mask mandates and other precautions are ending in many places. He believes expanding off-label use in the US would provide an additional level of safety to desperate families – including those so eager to get the vaccines, they lie about their children’s ages. This was a move that all experts strongly cautioned against. “I think lying about this is the worst idea,” von Meissner said. “It’s stupid to do it that way, I’m sorry.” Vaccines and medication should only be given under the supervision of a trained health worker who understands the child’s health history. Lying “encourages subterfuge”, Persad said, which might create perverse incentives for parents not to report side effects or seek follow-up care. Even traveling out of the country, for those lucky enough to do so, isn’t ideal, because it makes it more difficult to track safety signals and data on how effective the vaccines are and who has received them, Persad said. “You could do some of that same stuff for off-label.” Another option for eager families could be expanding the Pfizer trial to include more under-five kids, offering additional data on efficacy, which is particularly important if the trials are shifting from measuring immune responses to tracking real-life cases, Persad said. And new arms of the trials could test different doses among different ages of children. The 3 mg doses were effective in children six months to two years, but not in kids aged two to five. “It is baffling to me that they did not try these small trials at a more intermediate dose,” Persad said. Companies could also make the vaccines available, especially for higher-risk kids, through the FDA’s expanded access program, Persad said. “Honestly, I would love to see that, as opposed to off-label, where you don’t have the ability to collect as much of this data.”",News/World news,US parents of under-fives clamor for off-label use over Covid vaccine delays,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/under-five-covid-vaccine-parents-off-label-use
2/17/2022,"In an unremarkable brown building with 1970s interior decor, nestled between a gas station and a Moose Lodge, Kim Ulmer and two of his employees were making quick work of a steer. The animal was led through a chute into the room at US Beef Producers where it would spend the last few minutes of its life. Less than an hour later, stripped of its head, hide and innards as country music played, it would become two sides of beef.  Ulmer and about a dozen other investors bought and reopened the shuttered meatpacking plant in Fort Pierre, South Dakota, in 2020. Upset that local cattle ranchers had to send animals hundreds of miles away to be slaughtered before being sent back to Fort Pierre-area stores and restaurants, they hoped to provide a local option. Nearly two years later, they’re still trying to get certified by the state, but have been held back by what they say are unreasonable requirements. At the moment they are only able to slaughter a handful of cows a week and are required to return the meat to the owner rather than sell it to retailers, which has made the facility’s future uncertain. Finding a viable situation is not easy, with thousands of cattle ranchers and independent slaughterhouses across the United States stuck in a beef-production system dominated by four huge companies. “If I had an account with [local grocery chain] Lynn’s Dakotamart for six a week, I could kill six a week,” Ulmer said as he tried to scrub beef blood from his pants at the plant just across the Missouri River from Pierre, the state capital. “But you can’t kill without a destination.” The conglomerates – JBS, Cargill, Tyson Foods and National Beef Packing – control about 85% of the beef industry’s processing capacity. That imbalance, experts say, has made it more difficult for ranchers to get a fair price for their cattle and for independent processors to stay in business, even though meat prices have risen sharply during the pandemic. At the consumer end of the chain, beef and veal have gone up 16% in the last year, according to the latest figures from the Department of Labor, while food prices overall have gone up 7%. Joe Biden has announced a focus on righting the lopsided industry. In January he pledged $1bn to expand meat and poultry processing with the aim of helping independent processors like Ulmer compete with the big four companies, as well as expanding choice and lowering prices for consumers. It’s part of a wider move by Biden to blame some corporations for high prices as the president faces inflation at its highest level in 40 years. And after decades of failed attempts to better regulate competition in the meat industry, Congress has recently tried to make progress. A bipartisan bill introduced last year by Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, would require meatpackers to buy a certain amount of livestock from independent ranchers, and a second bipartisan bill would create a special office to investigate anticompetitive activities. “You have these big packers lobbying hard against the independent producer,” Grassley said. “They’re screwing the consumer. They’re screwing the cattle producers.” Representatives of JBS and National Beef Packing did not respond to interview requests. Cargill and Tyson representatives declined to answer questions. As the Biden policy to boost independent meat processors was unveiled, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted a graphic that compared wholesale beef prices and cattle values. Four big companies control 50+% of meat processing.These middlemen use their position to overcharge grocery stores and ultimately, consumers. @POTUS is announcing an action plan to strengthen competition and keep fighting for fair prices for farmers, ranchers, and families. pic.twitter.com/QiIEwEBByH Industry analysts have broadly welcomed the Biden administration’s move, though there is disagreement about how much, and how quickly, it is likely to impact prices for consumers and ranchers, and whether it can amount to any meaningful reduction of consolidation without bolder antitrust moves. It is, however, a positive sign for Ulmer and smaller scale meatpackers hoping to expand in a system that has arguably not been working very well for anyone except the giant firms. It can be difficult to follow how a steer becomes a hamburger and consolidation within the meat industry has made that process even more opaque. Essentially, a cattle ranch that doesn’t raise animals itself sells young cattle to a feedlot, where they are fed until they’re ready for slaughter. A processor, or slaughterhouse, buys the animals, kills them and turns them into steaks, hamburgers and other cuts of meat. The meat is then sold to grocery stores, restaurants, schools, prisons and other institutions to feed to consumers. The problem with consolidation of meat processors is that large swaths of the country have no slaughterhouses left, meaning live cows must be trucked hundreds of miles to a plant and then the meat trucked hundreds of miles back to that same town. Farmers and independent slaughterhouses say it’s difficult to wedge their way into the process, which they claim is riddled with secret contracts that make it impossible to figure out the real price of beef. Retail beef prices spiked early in the pandemic as meatpacking plants were beset by coronavirus infections, with ground chuck soaring to $5.33 (£3.92) a pound in June 2020 compared to $3.95 (£2.91) the previous June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price has since declined to $4.77 (£3.51). Farmers receive about 39% of the retail price of the cattle they raise, said USDA economist William Hahn, noting that figure fluctuates higher and lower over time. Federal regulators and Congress need to recognize that significant portions of livestock-related laws were written in the 1800s and need updating, said Thomas Tomich, a professor of sustainability science and policy at the University of California at Davis who co-authored a 2021 paper on the effects of industry consolidation on California ranchers and processors. The pandemic, which crippled supply as demand for meat spiked, helped focus attention on the effects of consolidation, he said. “It’s great to see the federal government give attention to this in a way we haven’t seen maybe in my lifetime,” Tomich said. “The pandemic is a terrible thing, but the silver lining is that it has revealed some things in our food system that have been developing for decades.” For smaller-scale ranchers like Molly Watkins, who owns a farm in Linden, California, the loss of local slaughterhouses means she and her husband must drive farther than ever to sell a cow, all for a low price that makes it hardly worth the effort. The auction system, which ensures transparent prices in the cattle industry, has fallen apart as meatpackers have come to rely more on fixed-price contracts, she said. “We got nothing for one of the cows,” said Watkins, who did not understand why. “Somebody got her and ground her up and ate her, but we as growers got nothing. To get absolutely nothing for an animal you grew and brought into town yourself? That’s the world we live in right now.” Nearby ranchers have had the same problems, she said, meaning sales of hay, which she also grows on the farm, have dropped steadily in recent years. Big meat processors say through industry organizations they’re not responsible for the changes experienced by Watkins and thousands of others. Sarah Little, vice president of communications for the North American Meat Institute, which represents slaughterhouses and packers, said supply and demand and other factors are behind the recent turmoil. Four companies have dominated the industry for 30 years and consolidation has been good for the meat industry, she said, helping companies weather the pandemic, labor shortages and drought. “It’s economies of scale and it’s allowed the industry to be more sustainable,” Little said. “We produce more meat from fewer cattle.” But some economists argue consolidation has created a lack of transparency that makes it difficult to pin down why consumers are paying exorbitant prices for beef and farmers are making so little. The federal government has failed for 30 years to enforce antitrust laws, economists say, which is one reason steaks cost so much. “Monopoly is a sign of market failure,” said David Anderson, an economist with the Texas A&M University AgriLife Extension. “While we have a pretty free and competitive marketplace, we have some rules of the road. We have an antitrust act, which should enable the justice department to investigate.” Nevertheless, a 2021 report commissioned by Congress and written by Anderson and two other Texas A&M economists concluded consolidation among meatpackers has not affected beef prices much. “Research indicates that there is market power, but its effect has been small,” the report noted. Regardless of the root causes of the problems, several in the industry said the upcoming federal investment would help smaller slaughterhouses gain all-important federal certification, which allows plants to sell meat to consumers. Plants must have modern equipment and a US Department of Agriculture inspector onsite to be certified. “The USDA-inspected plants are just a lot more complicated and a lot more expensive to build and maintain,” said John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union since 1989. “We hope we will get some new plants started and we hope we will get some of the plants we already have modernized.” Modern slaughterhouses are more desirable to cattle producers because they’re more likely to ensure humane treatment and quick kills, said Bill Niman, founder of the Niman Ranch meat company, a ubiquitous brand among San Francisco Bay area restaurants. “Even though we support small livestock operations from farm to plate, when it comes to meat quality and safety these larger consolidated operations are better than the smaller plants,” said Niman, who left his namesake company in 2007 and now sells animals from his home farm north of San Francisco to a local meat brand. “It’s hard to retrofit an old plant to address all animal welfare concerns.” Among those working to modernize plants is Gary Hendrix of Baird, Texas. He spent a decade gathering investors to start NSC Beef Processing (the acronym stands for No Spinal Cord), which opened a slaughterhouse two years ago to test and showcase new technology Hendrix says will cut labor costs by 30%. The goal is to help rural communities open smaller slaughterhouses to help local ranchers and retailers compete in the difficult market, he said. Antitrust actions would be helpful, Hendrix said, and would attract smaller operators to the industry. “I don’t think you’re going to reduce the size of those companies until you get more players in the industry,” he said. “It’s kind of like trying to umpire a baseball game from outside the stadium. You’ve got to get in the game to affect the outcome.” Back at US Beef Producers in Fort Pierre, which plans to apply for a portion of the new federal money to install new equipment, employee Daniel Bennett relaxes after finishing a slaughter, flecks of cow flesh and bone covering his face, hair and clothes. Anyone who eats beef should understand how the industry works, he said. “You go to Burger King and get a Whopper, but you don’t consider where the meat comes from,” said Bennett, who worked at the fast-food chain before he was hired by the slaughterhouse last year. “I mean, you know. You just don’t think about it.”",News/Environment,Costly cow: can Biden’s bet on local meat producers loosen big beef’s grip?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/us-meat-prices-big-beef-local-producers-biden
2/17/2022,"As the drug overdose crisis in the United States exploded during the coronavirus pandemic – killing an unprecedented 100,000 people in 12 months – Black and Indigenous Americans were increasingly likely to become the victims. Drug overdose rates in America surged by 31% in 2020, according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as the pandemic left many facing lockdowns, economic and emotional strain. But researchers at UCLA have found that the death rate surged most dramatically among Black and Indigenous Americans, who saw a staggering increase of 49% and 43% respectively in just one year.  While the data is not broken down by drug type, experts point toward one driving force: the explosion of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, a highly potent drug that has flooded the US market and often ends up mixed into street drugs such as heroin, methamphetamines or cocaine. Researchers say the numbers highlight the shifting dynamics of who is most at risk from the opioid crisis, which has in recent decades been viewed as an epidemic of rural, white America. Between 2019 and 2020, the overdose death rate for Black and Indigenous Americans surpassed that of white Americans, who were already dying in unprecedented numbers. “We’re at a historically tragic moment,” said UCLA addiction researcher Joseph Friedman, who co-authored the study. “The increasing toxicity of the drug supply has disproportionately affected communities of color.” The tragedy has hit home for the Black community with several recent high profile deaths, including the actor Michael K Williams and comedian Fuquan Johnson. Williams was found dead in his Brooklyn home in September from a mix of heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. Four men have since been charged in his death. Johnson, 42, died at a Venice Beach house party after reportedly ingesting cocaine contaminated by fentanyl. “He loved life and he was just starting to make his mark,” Pauline Johnson, Fuquan’s mother, told the Guardian, adding that her son would not have taken the drug if he knew it contained a dangerous synthetic. Friedman and the study’s co-author Dr Helena Hansen, a UCLA psychiatrist and anthropologist, warn in their report that drug overdoses are “increasingly becoming a racial justice issue”, one that has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic but stems from historic inequities, including high rates of incarceration, economic disenfranchisement and loss of community cohesion. Others point to a “perfect storm” created by a wave of super-potent synthetic drugs hitting the streets at a time users were feeling increased isolation and displacement because of the pandemic. These problems may have had bigger impacts in communities of color, which saw some of the worst health consequences from the coronavirus while shouldering some of the largest economic burdens. Overall, however, there are still “a lot of unknowns” about what exactly has driven the sudden rise, or whether it will continue, says Ricky Bluthenthal, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California who was not involved in the study. Part of the problem is that the pandemic has limited hands-on research, says Bluthenthal, who usually collects information from drug users in Los Angeles and San Francisco, but was unable to get out into the field in 2020. But Bluthenthal does point to the rise of fentanyl as a key element of the crisis. “What’s happening is fentanyl is replacing heroin in most of the nation’s largest drug markets,” said Bluthenthal. “As fentanyl has begun to replace heroin and become the only thing available, you have this increased mortality among African Americans.” The UCLA study, which has not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal, analysed the most recent data from CDC on overdose trends. While the number of overdose deaths rose for all racial groups nationally between 2019 and 2020, the rate increased fastest for African Americans, the study found, growing by 49% compared to a growth of 26% for white people. Overall death rates were highest for Indigenous Americans – who lost 41.4 people per 100,000 in the population in 2020, an increase of 43% over 2019. Nationally, death rates for Hispanics were less than those of whites and Asian American deaths were not assessed by the UCLA study. The 2020 national numbers represent a huge shift from a decade earlier when white Americans were twice as likely to die of drug overdoses. It also complicates a narrative that has often painted the last two decades of opioid deaths as a crisis of white despair. In 2010, at a time when doctors were flooding lower-income, white communities with prescription opioid pills, white Americans were twice as likely to die of overdoses as Black Americans, according to the study’s authors. Then the US cracked down on opioid prescribing practices, forcing many who were dependent on opioids to turn to street drugs such as heroin. This created larger markets around the country for illegal heroin, which was soon being adulterated and then replaced altogether by the cheaper-to-make and easier-to-transport synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, said Hansen. “It began in the north-east, but it’s now spanned into the west,” she explained. “The overdose death rates for all racial groups rose dramatically, but in 2020 Indigenous American and black death rates crossed over to exceed white death rates.” Hansen and other drug addiction researchers who spoke with the Guardian challenged the narrative that drug overdoses are a white crisis – saying the discussion has become overly focused on “deaths of despair”, a theory that blames the increase in drug overdose in the early 2000s on the growing job losses and disenfranchisement in predominantly white, more rural areas. Hansen said this construct dismisses waves of overdoses in Black and brown communities that began decades earlier, when heroin was marketed toward economically disadvantaged communities starting in 1960s and continuing through the crack epidemic of the 1980s, which lead to the “war on drugs” and mass incarceration. “When Black people died it was normalized,” said Hansen, who is working on a book on this topic. She believes that people who are economically disenfranchised are those most vulnerable to drug overdoses, no matter their race. “However, when it comes to poor Black and brown neighborhoods, this happened decades earlier and we didn’t call that ‘deaths of despair’,” she said. “We called that ‘crime’.” The crisis facing Indigenous Americans has also been overlooked and misunderstood, said Melissa Walls, an indigenous addiction expert who is the director of the Great Lakes Hub for the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health in Duluth Minnesota. Pharmaceutical companies agreed to a $590m settlement with Indigenous American tribes this month, over claims that the companies’ targeted sales of opioid pills, such as Oxycontin, fueled waves of addiction and overdose deaths that have hit indigenous communities particularly hard. The data show Indigenous Americans have had overdose death rates competing with those of whites since the rise of prescription opioids in the early 2000s – and have a 2020 rate well above those of other racial groups at 41 deaths per 100,000 people. But Walls said the roots of the crisis among tribal groups goes back much further to first contacts with Europeans that began the displacement of indigenous people from their tribal lands, and left many Indigenous Americans disenfranchised. “This is just the teeny tiny top of the iceberg of a lot of historical trauma and structural racism that goes back to how this country was founded and how Indigenous people have been treated since colonizers arrived,” Walls said. “These are just symptoms of a much bigger historical legacy of oppression that continues today.” Yet she worries that focus on the addiction problems further pathologizes Indigenous communities, when instead the emphasis should be on supporting tribes to rebuild their cultures. “These issues veil the reality of strength and brilliance in the indigenous communities,” said Walls, who has worked on creating programs to address addiction problems by using traditional Indigenous American healing methods. “Every single native community I have worked with shares one common answer to these issues and that is reclaiming our culture. Returning to our cultural teachings is going to be the ticket out of this mess.” Friedman said that recent incarceration is also a huge risk factor for overdoses – and one that disproportionately affects Black and Indigenous Amercians “due to the over-policing and over-incarceration of Black and Indigenous communities”. Those who have just been released from jail are more prone to overdoses because their tolerance for drugs is low, while a lack of treatment services and social support increases the risk of relapsing. The fact that rising overdoses come amid a pandemic that has already disproportionately affected communities of color makes the study even more troubling, said Dr Daniel Ciccarone, a professor specializing in addiction medicine at the University of California San Francisco. “This is very unfortunate data,” said Ciccarone. “The historic magnitude of the drug crisis is tearing the fabric of our society,” he said. “It’s time for fundamental policy changes in how we treat and prevent drug use.”",News/US news,‘Historically tragic’: why are drug overdoses rising among Black and Indigenous Americans?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/black-native-americans-fentanyl-deaths-rise-opioid-crisis

2/17/2022,"Akaleidoscope of disco glitter balls? Check. Tony Manero in a gleaming white suit? Check. More Bee Gees hits than a 70s karaoke session? Check check check. All the iconic elements from the 1977 film are in place in Bill Kenwright’s big-hearted production, as well as a few extras: more songs, more dancing and a Bee Gees band performing live on stage. The only thing missing is a bit more grit and fiery passion in a show that’ll get you dancing, but never hits fever pitch. Oh, and there’s no John Travolta. Alas. Instead, Richard Winsor brings his own qualities to the role of Tony Manero, a brilliant dancer stuck working in a paint shop in 70s Brooklyn. Winsor’s Manero comes across as a thoroughly nice and painfully vulnerable young man. The scenes at home with Manero’s abusive father (Phillip Aiden) lend depth to a production that can feel stuck halfway between a hen night extravaganza and something much darker and more considered.  Winsor also brings the precision of a professional – one who has danced lead roles for Matthew Bourne – to his performance. The disco numbers, choreographed with winking humour by Bill Deamer, suffer slightly for this professionalism. It all feels just a bit too tidy: dancing to admire rather than really lose yourself in. It’s the newly devised dance numbers, particularly between Winsor’s Manero and Olivia Fines’ Stephanie Mangano, that really impress. When Manero and Mangano practise together in the studio, there’s a flair to their dancing that feels liberating. And it’s only in Manero’s final scene, when Winsor is able to truly express himself with some yearning contemporary dance, that this Fever begins to burn.

2/17/2022,"Catalan-language drama Alcarràs won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival as the headline awards were dominated by women. Two of the three best film prizes went to films from female directors, while both acting awards, which are gender-neutral, went to women, as did the best director award. Alcarràs, directed by Carla Simón, came away with the festival’s top prize: a drama set in the Catalan countryside, it follows the difficulties of a farming family after their landowner decides to replace their peach trees with solar panels. It is the second feature from Simon, after the well received Summer 1993, released in 2017.  The third place jury prize went to acclaimed Mexican drama Robe of Gems, a debut feature from director Natalia López Gallardo, who previously worked as an editor on Carlos Reygadas’ Silent Light and Post Tenebras Lux. Separating them was South Korean director Hong Sang-soo, whose The Novelist’s Film took the second place grand jury prize. Berlin introduced gender-neutral acting awards in 2021 and, as previously, both went to women. Best lead performance was won byMeltem Kaptan for her portrayal of a mother who takes on the US justice system to get her son released from Guantánamo Bay in Rabiye Kurnaz Vs George W Bush, while best supporting performance went to Laura Basuki for her role in Indonesian drama Nana. Rabiye Kurnaz Vs George W Bush also took the best screenplay award for Laila Stieler, while veteran French film-maker Claire Denis won best director for Fire (Or Both Sides of the Blade), her new film, starring Juliette Binoche. While the 2021 festival was entirely virtual, 2022’s staged in-person events while abiding by local pandemic restrictions. The most significant casualty was Isabelle Huppert, who was unable to appear to collect her honorary Golden Bear lifetime achievement award after testing positive for coronavirus shortly before the scheduled presentation.

2/17/2022,"Ministers are preparing to scrap the “golden visa” system that allows wealthy foreign investors a fast track to living in the UK, amid concerns over links with Russia. Given concerns about how the system is being taken advantage of, and against a backdrop of souring relations with Moscow given its military buildup on the border with Ukraine, the home secretary, Priti Patel, is to axe the residence route.  Launched in 2008, the scheme allows people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for a “tier one investor visa”. Government sources suggested Patel would get rid of the pathway to residency next week, amid concerns that not enough background checks are being made on applicants. Armed forces minister James Heappey suggested the change was being made in part because of the Kremlin’s buildup of troops near Ukraine. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday: “Changes were made to that in 2015 and 2019 to make sure that the checks were ever more stringent. But absolutely, as we enter into what could be a generation or longer of quite acute competition with Russia, all of the things that have become normal in Anglo-Russian relations over the last 30 years will be up for review. And that is, I think, what the home secretary and her team are looking at at the moment.” At least 700 such visas have been issued to Russian millionaires in the first eight years of the scheme, according to the Times. The controversial issue had been due to come to a head in several weeks anyway, as an amendment tabled to the nationality and borders bill during its report stage in the House of Lords would, if passed, have required the visa route to be suspended. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and former minister, has previously called for a full review of the scheme, saying the government was “giving out golden visas to dodgy Russian oligarchs” by allowing the system to be used as a “backdoor loophole” to funnel dirty money into the UK. In 2018 a report published by the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee, which at that time included Patel as a member, accused ministers of risking national security by “turning a blind eye” to the Russian “dirty money” flowing through the City of London. The committee’s current chair, Tom Tugendhat, said it was “great news” that the golden visa system would be scrapped, tweeting that it was “so often used to get round proper checks”. Concerns over the practice of issuing golden visas were raised during the committee’s inquiry, which found that despite the outcry over the Salisbury novichok attack, Vladimir Putin and his allies were continuing to use London as a base for their “corrupt assets”. Concerns have previously been raised about ties between the Conservatives and Russian oligarchs. In November, Labour said that according to calculations based on disclosures to the Electoral Commission, £1.93m had been handed to the Conservative party or individual constituency associations by Russians or people who made money from the country in the period since Boris Johnson took power.",News/UK news,UK ministers plan to scrap ‘golden visa’ scheme amid Russia concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/uk-ministers-plan-to-scrap-golden-visa-scheme-amid-russia-concerns
