4/15/2022,"Prince Harry and Meghan have visited the Queen at Windsor Castle on their way to the Invictus Games. The couple were travelling to The Hague in the Netherlands for the games, which begin on Saturday, and on Thursday visited the UK together for the first time since stepping down as senior working royals more than two years ago. It is understood the Duke and Duchess of Sussex also met with Prince Charles. The visit comes after Harry was absent from Prince Philip’s memorial service in London last month. The duke is in the process of bringing a claim against the Home Office after being told he would no longer receive the same level of personal protective security when visiting from the US, despite offering to pay for it himself. Prince Harry wants to bring his children to visit, but he and his family are “unable to return to his home” because it is too dangerous, his legal representative has said. However, Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, told PA Media this week that Harry is “not an expert in security”. “The truth is I have no doubt that he will be protected, whether he takes his own team or whether the Dutch authorities give him some kind of VIP status,” he said, referring to the likely security arrangements in The Hague. “The truth is, if there’s a risk both countries – ours and the Netherlands – have sophisticated systems of determining risk. “This country has determined he is no longer at risk. That may or may not be true, but people far better qualified than I am now can make that decision and they never make it lightly.” Harry and Meghan chose to make their first public appearance together at the Invictus Games almost five years ago. The duke founded the games to give military veterans the challenge of competing in sporting events similar to the Paralympics.

4/15/2022,"The prospect of makeshift beds, campfire cuisine and long-drop loos used to be a turn-off for holidaymakers but new research underlines the scale of the domestic camping boom during Covid, as millions have swapped foreign sun loungers for s’mores and sleeping bags. One in five British adults have been on a camping or caravan holiday since the pandemic began, according to market researchers Mintel. Of these about 4.5 million were sleeping in a tent or caravan for the first time, it estimated. With overseas trips often out of reach, spending on these kinds of trips surged to £2.7bn in 2021. That was nearly 80% more than in 2020 when lockdowns decimated travel plans. The affordability of these types of holidays is traditionally the main attraction but the pandemic saw an influx of more affluent families on campsites, Mintel said. Almost four in 10 “Covid campers” had a household income above £50,000, compared with about a fifth of those who camped or caravanned pre-crisis. “Many of these customers are likely to have substituted planned holidays abroad for staycations,” said John Worthington, Mintel’s senior travel analyst – and it remains to be seen if they will go again as overseas travel opens up, albeit against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis. The “rising cost of living crisis has the potential to dampen consumer spending on all holiday types”, he said. “Camping and caravanning, however, hold the advantage of being seen as an affordable holiday. Our research shows that ‘low cost’ is seen as the leading attraction for consumers.” He added that this part of the holiday market had prospered before when people were encountering financial hardship, such as during the 2009 recession, when they traded more expensive trips abroad for budget domestic holidays. “In the short-term, the cost of living crisis might bring in those with tighter household budgets who are cutting back on more expensive holidays, including a potential trip abroad,” said Worthington. Organisations such as the Camping and Caravanning Club are among the groups to have reported strong bookings before the Easter getaway suggesting Britons, who have invested thousands pounds in a caravan or other holiday vehicles, including motorhomes and converted vans, are eager to use them again. Last year dealerships struggled to get their hands on enough vans as a growing number of under-40s, including new dog owners, bought homes on wheels. Britons also bought large quantities of camping supplies, almost cleaning out specialist stores ahead of the summer holidays.",News/Business,"British camping holidays boom in pandemic, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/15/british-camping-caravanning-holidays-boom-pandemic-mintel
4/15/2022,"A musical drama about the life of John Hume, one of the main forces behind the Good Friday agreement, will be staged next year to mark the 25th anniversary of the historic deal that helped end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. Beyond Belief, written by Damian Gorman with music by Brian O’Doherty, is the second part of a “peace-building trilogy” at the Playhouse in Hume’s home town, Derry, after The White Handkerchief, a play about the events of Bloody Sunday, earlier this year. Mo Hume, the late politician’s daughter, said the play would “present his life and work with great integrity but also joy. My father’s career had many triumphs, many hardships, but he was a warm, kind and funny family man, a man who loved to sing. He was a very proud Derry man.” Hume’s family and the John and Pat Hume Foundation are supporting the production. Hume – the leader of the Northern Irish nationalist party the SDLP for more than 20 years, a Westminster MP and a member of the European parliament – helped persuade the IRA to give up its armed struggle. He argued that nationalists and unionists needed to share power and pursue their goals by peaceful, democratic means. After the Good Friday agreement was signed on 10 April 1998, with the UK prime minister Tony Blair declaring the “hand of history is upon our shoulder”, Hume and the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize. Brid Rodgers, a former SDLP deputy leader and a friend of Hume’s, said: “A lot of people think of John Hume as a figure in history; not many know the real, human John Hume. As well as being an innovator, motivator and inspiring a generation, he was good fun. No party was ever complete without John singing.” The drama will show Hume at his strongest and his weakest, said its director, Kieran Griffiths. Hume had dementia towards the end of his life. “When he was most vulnerable, he’d sometimes be lost in his own city. People in Derry would gently take his arm and see him home, without any sense of shaming.” Griffiths added: “His relationship with his wife, Pat, is crucial – they were a joint force. In a very simple sense, Beyond Belief is a love story.” When Hume died in August 2020, Covid restrictions meant there could be only a small funeral. “People were robbed of the chance to say a proper goodbye. I’m hoping the play will give the community and the wider diaspora a chance to lay their hands on him.” In recent years, the power-sharing arrangements set up under the Good Friday agreement have been periodically in jeopardy. Rodgers said: “This drama will remind people what’s at stake, what John was trying to achieve and how important it is that it endures.”  Beyond Belief: The Life and Mission of John Hume will be at the Derry Playhouse from 31 March-7 April 2023, with the final performance broadcast live.

4/15/2022,"It has been a physically and emotionally draining week for Manchester City. Pep Guardiola says City are “in big trouble” due to injuries picked up in their triumphant draw at the Wanda Metropolitano after Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker were forced off. Phil Foden spent most of the game sporting a bandaged head after a needlessly robust challenge from Felipe. Although some rejigging will be required for the second meeting with Liverpool in a week, the real challenge for Guardiola will be to refresh the team mentally for another season-defining match. The level of focus required at the Etihad on Sunday and in Spain on Wednesday will have been incredibly challenging for the players, many of whom played in both. An FA Cup semi-final is the kind of contest to sharpen the mind, although there will be no rest after. City face two games a week until mid-May so need to manage their bodies and minds carefully for the foreseeable. There can be no slip-ups. WU Manchester City v Liverpool, Saturday 4.30pm (all times BST) Those hoping the Liverpool-City rivalry might add a dimension of seething contempt to make it more fun for the neutral may get their wish through familiarity. Just six days since a match that had Alan Shearer and even Roy Keane drooling over footballing artistry, Wembley’s wide-open spaces and the prospective trebles and quadruples at stake may just add the requisite tension. Chuck in a heavy foul here and a questionable refereeing decision there, and the pot may just boil over. Not that Jürgen Klopp is likely to follow the Diego Simeone playbook: his focus is always on getting the best from his team rather than dragging the opposition down. While he may hand roles to Harvey Elliott and Roberto Firmino, benched last week, Caoimhín Kelleher – despite his Wembley heroics in the Carabao Cup – is unlikely to be goalkeeper, Alisson having played in the quarter-final at Nottingham Forest. The Brazilian’s expected presence reflects the competition’s importance to his manager. JB Antonio Rüdiger’s post-match rage achieved instant meme status as Chelsea exited the Champions League. The German’s uncharacteristic slip had allowed Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema to steal in for the header that decided the tie. The Bernabéu is one possible destination for a player whose contract expires at the end of the season as time ticks down on the team funded by Roman Abramovich. César Azpilicueta’s contract extension may have been triggered recently but that may not preclude his departure and he, Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen are all linked with Barcelona, where free transfers are being used to rebuild. Were Abramovich still around, Thomas Tuchel’s future would almost certainly be in question but the four consortiums bidding to buy the Russian’s frozen stake in the club all appear to recognise his popularity with fans. Now the Champions League defence has gone, reaching the FA Cup final would allow the Abramovich era a send-off on a grand stage. JB Chelsea v Crystal Palace, Sunday 4.30pm Football is full of silly rules that help the bigger clubs hold power over the smaller ones. For example, Conor Gallagher cannot play in an FA Cup semi-final despite helping Crystal Palace through each round to Wembley, purely because he is owned by Chelsea, a club that let him leave in the summer as they did not want to use him. They will not permit him to play. If Chelsea are willing to loan out a player, they should do so at their own risk. Gallagher has been a standout performer all season for Patrick Vieira, the manager helping improve him as a player, giving him experience and increasing his value. All of which help Chelsea in the long run. If Gallagher had been allowed to play and scored the winner for Palace, that is a danger Chelsea should have had to live with. Surely the point of sending Gallagher out is for him to experience big occasions and deal with them? WU Antonio Conte’s revamped and revitalised front three are earning plaudits as Spurs make a timely charge for fourth spot, but further back a foundation is being laid. Eric Dier has settled at the heart of a disciplined back three that has conceded five times in the past seven Premier League games (three of those came at Old Trafford). While Harry Maguire struggles at Manchester United, Dier is looking like an international footballer once again and should add to his 45 England caps in the near future. He may be the best English centre-back in the Premier League on form. Gareth Southgate likes to play with three centre-backs, so Dier seems an obvious choice. He is playing in the most successful club version of the same formation and the Nations League fixtures take place in June. Dier has already made 28 Premier League appearances this season; the last time he made more was in 2017-18, a sign he is finding greater consistency. WU Tottenham v Brighton, Saturday 12.30pm David de Gea, Juan Mata and Phil Jones are the survivors from the last Manchester United team to lose to Norwich, a 2-1 Canaries win at Old Trafford in December 2015. That United team ended the Premier League season in fifth, whereas the current side are sixth with very little chance of climbing to fourth. Louis van Gaal paid for fifth with his sacking. While Ralf Rangnick’s role was only temporary, United’s slump, taking in his inability to arrest Maguire’s decline or answer the Cristiano Ronaldo question, means his credibility as a future consultant to the owners has been marked down. Rangnick’s response to last Saturday’s defeat at Everton was shrugging detachment, and he has also hinted he played no part in the recruitment of a new manager, expected to be Erik ten Hag. The German is hardly alone in becoming a spare part amid United’s fall from grace. Such dysfunction is now part of the package. JB Manchester United v Norwich, Saturday 3pm “I understand that we will never be best friends,” was how Granit Xhaka described his relationship with Arsenal fans in a Players’ Tribune piece published on Wednesday. “I want you to know that whatever I do on the pitch, it comes from the right place.” That Xhaka has not lived up to expectations since his arrival from Borussia Mönchengladbach in the summer of 2016 is true. He is notorious for some injudicious tackling and a confrontation with home supporters in 2019. But he has also been backed by each of Arsène Wenger, Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta and is an idol back home in Switzerland, where there is bemusement at such pariah status. At St Mary’s, with Kieran Tierney out for the season and Nuno Tavares struggling to settle, it is likely Xhaka will be asked to reprise the left-back role he was given against Brighton last week. Such adaptability is what senior players offer their managers. JB Southampton v Arsenal, Saturday 3pm This week Watford’s board confirmed their commitment to staying at Vicarage Road, the expansion to the 22,000 capacity a case of “when, not if”. There had been talk of moving to a purpose-built stadium at Bushey Hall Golf Club with a capacity of 33,000, but that appears at its end. On its day the old place, its corners now all closed off, can give off a buzzy, fun atmosphere and is pleasingly close enough to the town centre, unlike many new stadiums. Unfortunately, its chances of staying a Premier League ground are low and mostly down to the team’s ruinous home form. Roy Hodgson’s record of seven losses in 11 matches includes a total blank at Vicarage Road. Watford last won there against Manchester United on 20 November, losing every home game since. The likelihood of Saturday staging the latest chapter of Christian Eriksen’s Brentford fable seems high. JB Watford v Brentford, Saturday 3pm Ryan Fraser’s injury against Wolves allowed Miguel Almirón a chance off the Newcastle bench. The Paraguayan has started only 13 times in the Premier League this season but has an opportunity to cement a place for the run-in. Against Wolves he was tireless, proving he can do the defensive side of the game required by Eddie Howe, having previously been a free spirit. Almirón made a real difference going forward, too, helping to create a goal eventually ruled out by VAR. Almirón’s agent has visited the north-east recently to discuss the player’s future. . The playmaker should use the games ahead to show what he can offer Newcastle in the long term, starting with Leicester’s visit. There will be no shortage of new arrivals in the summer. WU Newcastle v Leicester, Sunday 2.15pm Wout Weghorst trudged off 11 minutes into the second half of Burnley’s defeat at Norwich last week. The Dutch international is supposed to be firing the Clarets to safety but has managed just one goal in 12 appearances since arriving in January. “I think – and it is a positive, but it is a strange thing to mention – Wout is almost too team-bound at the minute,” Sean Dyche said after the loss. Weghorst spent most of the game trying to control long balls and bring others into the game but it provided little to the team. Weghorst needs to be in the box to get on the end of quality crosses, something absent at Carrow Road. Burnley’s style is based on having a successful big striker. Without that their relegation may be confirmed far sooner than necessary. WU West Ham v Burnley, Sunday 2.15pm",Sport/Football,Premier League and FA Cup semi-finals: 10 things to look out for this weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/premier-league-and-fa-cup-semi-finals-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend
4/15/2022,"Seven out of 10 teachers in England have considered resigning in the past year, with more than half citing pay as a key factor, according to a survey of teachers. More than half of those polled said they have been forced to cut back their spending on food, while one in 10 have taken on a second job and others have resorted to food banks and other charitable support. The NASUWT teachers’ union, which commissioned the survey of 11,000 teachers before its national conference in Birmingham over the Easter weekend, said there would be an “unprecedented recruitment and retention crisis” unless there was a significant pay rise. The government has promised to increase pay for newly qualified teachers in state schools, allowing starting salaries to rise from about £25,000 to £30,000 in 2024, meeting a commitment in the Conservative party’s 2019 election manifesto. But the pay rise will come at the expense of much lower increases for teachers with more than five years in the classroom, or in senior roles. Those teachers instead face a real-terms pay cut of 5% over the next two years, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Delegates at the NASUWT conference will debate a motion calling for possible industrial action if the government is unwilling to enter into discussions over teachers’ pay. Almost two-thirds of those who took part in the survey (64%) expressed anger over pay and said they felt they were being treated unfairly by the government. Only 1% said the felt teacher pay levels were about right. As the cost of living crisis begins to bite, nearly nine in 10 (89%) said they were either very worried or somewhat worried about their financial situation. Almost seven in 10 (68%) have cut back expenditure on clothes, nearly a quarter (24%) have either increased their use of credit or applied for a payday loan and more than a half (56%) have dipped into savings. Of those surveyed, 11% said they had taken a second job and just under 3% had resorted to food banks or other charitable assistance. Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said: “Teachers across the UK, and at every stage of their career, are seriously questioning if they can afford to continue another year in the education profession without a pay uplift that meets the sky-rocketing cost of living. “The government has continuously failed to heed teachers’ warnings that the toll of 12 years of pay erosion and successive pay freezes can no longer be endured. Now we are living with the bleak reality of teachers having no choice but to seek second jobs, cut back on essential supplies such as food and even relying on the assistance of food banks.” Stephen Morgan, shadow schools minister, said Labour was committed to recruiting thousands of new teachers to fill vacancies. “Successive Conservative governments and two years of chaos during the pandemic have piled pressure on to school staff resulting in record numbers looking to leave our schools. “Investing in school staff is investing in children’s learning and development. In failing teachers, the Conservatives are failing our children.” The motion before conference this weekend says that “unless there is a significant pay rise and restructure for teachers, there will continue to be an enormous recruitment and retention problem in the teaching profession”. It adds: “Conference is concerned that we lose many teachers in the first five years of their careers and that teaching has to be an attractive profession against other graduate professions that rewards and celebrates experience through fair and equitable pay.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our latest proposals on teacher pay set out how we will deliver a £30,000 starting salary for teachers by 2023/24, as well as the highest experienced teacher pay award since 2006 in 2022/23. “We understand that the rising cost of living is of concern to people across the country. We continue to balance rewarding teachers for their hard work – and attracting the brightest and the best into the profession – with a pay system that is appropriate and affordable for the taxpayer.”",News/Education,"Seven in 10 teachers in England thought of leaving in past year, poll shows",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/15/seven-in-10-teachers-in-england-thought-of-leaving-in-past-year-poll-shows
4/15/2022,"The four groups trying to buy Chelsea face an anxious wait after lodging improved bids for the club on Thursday. The merits of each offer are being assessed by Roman Abramovich and the club’s board, and Raine, the American bank handling the sale, is expected to take a preferred bidder to the UK government for approval early next week. Raine’s input is likely to have an influence on the Chelsea hierarchy’s decision and it is believed that the highest bid will not necessarily be the successful one. Abramovich, who was hit with sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is also expected to take into account the club’s future wellbeing. The Russian billionaire wants Chelsea, who could be sold for as much as £2.75bn, to be in good hands. The bidders all have a heavy background in American sports. They include a consortium led by the co-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly, and one by the owners of the Chicago Cubs, Tom and Laura Ricketts. A consortium fronted by Sir Martin Broughton and Sebastian Coe has received backing from the owners of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, Josh Harris and David Blitzer. The fourth bid is led by the Boston Celtics’ co-owner, Steve Pagliuca. All four groups say their bids are cash only and will not load Chelsea with debt. Sources close to the process believe that a preferred bid could emerge after Monday. However there have been delays throughout and there could be no developments until the end of the next week. The Premier League will need to ensure each bidder will pass its fit and proper owners test, while the government’s main priority is ensuring that no money from the sale goes to Abramovich. The government will need to issue a licence for the sale to go through. At first glance Boehly’s bid appears to be the one with the least complications. He has partnered with his fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss and the London businessman Jonathan Goldstein. The group has backing from the investment firm Clearlake Capital. Sources have dismissed suggestions that Clearlake would take a majority shareholding. The Tory peer Daniel Finkelstein and the publicist Barbara Charone will become non-executive directors if Boehly’s bid wins. The Boehly group was the first to move when it became clear that Abramovich’s ownership could not continue. It would have been able to complete a takeover by now had Raine not decided to hold an auction. The other groups are firmly in contention, however. The Ricketts family have undeterred by Chelsea fans opposing their bid over historical accusations of Islamophobia. They have partnered with the hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin and Rock Entertainment Group, which is headed by Dan Gilbert, who is worth an estimated $31bn (£23.7bn). The Ricketts plan to add Karan Bilimoria, a Tory peer, Chelsea fan and the founder of Cobra Beer, to the board. Broughton and Lord Coe are also seen as viable owners, even though they have not named all the investors behind their group. Their bid is complicated by Harris and Blitzer owning stakes in Crystal Palace which they would need to sell to become shareholders at Chelsea. Pagliuca will need to reduce his shareholding in Atalanta if his bid is successful. He has been joined by the Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and Elaine Andriejanssen, a businesswoman and Saverin’s wife, along with the chairman of the NBA, Larry Tanenbaum. Peter Guber, who owns part of the Dodgers with Boehly, is also involved with Pagliuca’s bid and there is backing from the former Disney chief executive Bob Iger, the B Capital co-founder Raj Ganguly, the venture capitalist Jim Breyer and entrepreneur Div Turakhia. The groups have been informed they must commit to investing at least £1bn in Chelsea’s infrastructure, academy and women’s team. The bidders all have plans to renovate Stamford Bridge. They will ant to give transfer backing to Thomas Tuchel, the manager of the men’s team, this summer.",Sport/Football,Chelsea bidders wait for news after submitting improved offers for club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/chelsea-bidders-submit-improved-offers-for-club
4/15/2022,"The decision to switch the all-weather championships card from Lingfield to Newcastle means that Tyrrhenian Sea returns to the track where he reeled off a mid-winter hat-trick, and he is likely to start at odds-on for his in-form trainer, Roger Varian, in the Betway Easter Classic at the end of the card. The four-year-old looked like one of the unluckiest losers of the all-weather campaign when only fourth at odds-on at Kempton Park last month, and he is better judged on a very cosy win from an opening mark of 87 on his handicap debut in February. His five rivals all arrive with more experience and Living Legend will be a danger if Joe Fanning gets loose on the lead, but Tyrrhenian Sea (4.45) is top on the ratings and has more scope for improvement too so it will be tough to deny him a fourth win from five starts. Newcastle 2.00 My Oberon was a respectable sixth in the Dubai Turf less than three weeks ago but provided he is over that, he is the clear form pick on his win in a qualifier on Tapeta at Southwell in February. Lingfield 2.20 Tough to rule out any of the dozen runners here with confidence, but Asadjumeirah has the best individual piece of recent form – an easy win at Newcastle in February – and has not has not done much wrong in his three starts since. Newcastle 2.35 Ejtilaab put up a career-best performance – in the 19th race of his career – at Kempton last month to win a handicap off 105 and anything close to that level will make him difficult to beat here. Lingfield 2.55 Zameka made his debut in a hot race at Kempton in November and is a potential handicap blot off 81. He has done all his racing at seven furlongs so far, however, and at the likely odds, Aasser, a winner in a solid time at Wolverhampton in December, makes more appeal.

Marginal preference is for the unbeaten second-favourite, who had more in hand than the half-length margin implies on his handicap debut at Southwell last month. Newcastle 3.45 Highfield Princess was beaten three lengths in the Champions Sprint at Ascot in October, has winning form at this trip and could get a soft lead as she is the only regular front-runner in the field. Lingfield 4.00 Most of these have a claim on their best form but Shoot To Kill could be the pick of the prices at around 10-1. He completed a hat-trick with a course-and-distance win in January and remains on a workable mark. Newcastle 4.15 Sleeping Lion looks like the safest option in a tricky stayers’ contest, having followed up a close third at Listed level in France with a solid win back up at two miles last time. The Olympic gold medal-winning equestrian Sir Mark Todd is free to resume his training career after receiving a four-month suspension, with two months deferred, over a video which was widely shared on social media in February showing him hitting an eventing horse with a tree branch after it was reluctant to jump into a lake. Todd admitted a breach of Rule J(19), which covers conduct prejudicial to the reputation of racing, when the British Horseracing Authority’s independent disciplinary panel reconvened to consider the case on Thursday. His licence was suspended by the British Horseracing Authority in mid-February, shortly after the video became public, and since his penalty was back-dated to that point, his licence has now been restored. Relaying the outcome on Thursday, Brian Barker QC, the chair of the three-person panel, said that the BHA and Todd’s legal team had reached “common ground” in respect of his sanction. Barker added that, having seen unedited footage of the incident, both sides agreed that the horse “showed no sign of fear or distress at any time”, that its welfare “does not appear to have been compromised and that the BHA does not suggest it was compromised”, and that Todd had been “calm in his attempt to encourage the horse to drop into the water, having first satisfied himself that the horse was capable of doing so”. However, “the use of a light branch rather than a manufactured whip … was not appropriate”, and “the consequence of achieving a high level of success in sport is that the public is more readily able to identify an individual and their actions … can be expected to be scrutinised by a wider audience.” Todd took out a trainer’s licence in 2019 and saddled his first winner in June 2020.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Tyrrhenian Sea expects smooth sailing in Easter Classic,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/14/talking-horses-tyrrhenian-sea-tough-to-oppose-in-easter-classic-at-newcastle-horse-racing-tips
4/15/2022,"More than two years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, nearly a quarter of incarcerated people awaiting their day in court in San Francisco county are being held beyond their original trial deadlines, with some individuals waiting for years for their cases to be heard. In June 2020, in the early months of the pandemic, 68 people were incarcerated in the county past their original trial deadlines, according to data from the public defender. By January 2022, the latest data available, that number had grown to nearly 250. Hundreds more are awaiting trial out of custody. California state law stipulates that those accused of crimes are entitled to a speedy trial – 30 to 60 days following their arraignment, depending on the nature of the crime. But backlogs in the court system, made worse by the pandemic, have obliterated those deadlines, often at significant cost to the mental health and wellbeing of those imprisoned, and their loved ones. The problem in the county became so severe that Mano Raju, the San Francisco public defender, filed a lawsuit in September 2021 alleging the city’s superior court is violating people’s constitutional right to a speedy trial. “These aren’t even people who have been convicted of a crime,” Raju said. “They’re just awaiting their day in court.” This disproportionately affects communities of color. Though Black residents comprise 6% of San Francisco’s total population, they make up about 45% of the county jail population. “Our clients are largely poor and from communities of color, so when their rights are trampled there isn’t always the outcry there would be if this was happening to people from another community,” said Raju. Robert Brewer said the long wait showed the criminal justice system’s unfairness. It has taken a toll on his health and put his life on hold. “You’re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, but you’re treated as if you’ve already been sentenced,” he said. Brewer was found not guilty of a homicide charge in May 2021 following a trial, after being held for more than five months past his original trial date. But since his release, the experience of incarceration has continued to affect his mental health. “Being released is not as joyful as you might expect,” Brewer said. “You come out of this hole with very little human contact. You make it out, but you leave a big piece of yourself in jail.” In his lawsuit, Raju points to the lingering effects of case backlogs on individuals’ mental health and the county jail’s treatment of incarcerated people during Covid-19 lockdowns to argue the court should do more to address the backlogs. Some people who have been incarcerated told the Guardian they were allowed out of their cells for less than an hour a day during outbreaks of the virus. Brewer said he was only allowed to shower every two to three days before returning to his cell, after a cellmate contracted Covid. Solitary confinement and social isolation have been strongly linked to negative impacts on mental health, including a heightened risk of suicide. The San Francisco sheriff’s department, which manages the jail, said it followed practices recommended by health officials in keeping custody officers and jail residents safe. The department acknowledged incarcerated people were sometimes held in their cells for upwards of 23 hours a day, citing a variety of reasons such as “social distancing protocols, quarantine protocols, isolation protocols, disciplinary action, administrative segregation, and staffing shortages”. Raju said: “Solitary-like conditions mean you can’t leave a cell, often one where you can reach out your arms and touch the walls, for more than one hour per day. This can have a strong psychological impact.” Kwixuan Maloof, a San Francisco deputy public defender, says that a trial deadline can serve as a source of stability and encourages people to resist the temptation to accept a plea bargain, which often involves pleading guilty and avoiding a trial in exchange for the possibility of more lenient sentencing or a charge being downgraded. But without that guarantee, the pressure to accept a bargain goes up, even for those who believe they have a strong chance of being exonerated in court. “It’s very frustrating for me, and 10 times more so for my clients, when they ask me when their trial is going to start and all I can say is ‘I don’t know,’” said Maloof. “In those circumstances, it becomes very easy to say: ‘You know what, I’m done. I’m going to take whatever deal they offer me.’” Prior to the pandemic, court backlogs were far from unheard of in the US. But an August 2021 study by the Thomson Reuters Institute found that the pandemic had substantially increased such backlogs nationwide, as trials were indefinitely delayed during surges of the virus and courts struggled to adapt to virtual operations. According to the judicial council of California, the clearance rate for criminal trials statewide has dropped by around 20% during the pandemic. As restrictions start to ease, success at alleviating the backlogs has been mixed as different municipalities experiment with varying approaches. Matt Malone, a public information officer with the Contra Costa county superior court, said that through a number of initiatives, the court had brought its case backlog from 104 in March 2021 to 51 in March 2022. If not for the suspension of jury trials during the Omicron surge, Malone notes, the backlog would probably have been even lower. Malone added the county had taken steps to adapt to social distancing requirements, such as making sure remote capabilities were “tremendously expanded”, staggering jury calls, and installing air filtration systems in courtrooms. Rose Marie Sims, a plaintiff in the legal action filed by Raju against the San Francisco superior court, said her son Christopher had been incarcerated for over two years and still had not received a trial. “I can’t believe this is America. I love this country, but the judicial system seems to have lost its mind,” said Sims. “How do you keep someone locked up like that without giving them their trial? Every time I talk with my son on the phone, I can hear the light leaving him.” Sims said her son had lost his fiancee and job and would need to start over. “He’s lost everything,” she said. “It’s traumatizing as a parent.” The public defender’s office, as well as the San Francisco district attorney, have called on the San Francisco superior court to make more rooms available for criminal trials in the civic center courthouse. In February of this year, Raju filed a petition in the California courts of appeal asking that the San Francisco court be forced to take steps to prioritize criminal trials. The Contra Costa county superior court, where Raju filed his original lawsuit in September, had concluded it did not have authority over the San Francisco superior court. A spokesperson for San Francisco superior court said the court was committed to justice and “processing all cases as expeditiously as possible under the difficult circumstances presented by the pandemic”. But Raju disagrees and said more needed to be done to process cases swiftly. “How long it will take to address the backlog depends on what the court is willing to do,” he said. “There is a lack of urgency.”  In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

4/15/2022,"Russia’s flagship missile cruiser Moskva has sunk in “stormy seas” while being towed to a port in the Black Sea following an explosion, the Russian defence ministry has announced. The Ukrainian southern military command claimed late on Wednesday to have struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, while distracting its crew with an aerial drone, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew to abandon ship. Russia’s defence ministry initially denied reports that it had sunk and claimed the fires had been extinguished. Four Russian ships that had gone to the Moskva’s rescue were being hampered by stormy weather and by ammunition blowing up onboard, it said. But late on Thursday, the ministry said in a statement: “The cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship’s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank.” Russia had said earlier that the crew of more than 500 crew were evacuated from the Soviet-era missile cruiser to other ships. The apparent attack and sinking of the Black Sea fleet’s flagship – 50 days after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine – represents a symbolic blow to the Kremlin. The Moskva was the pride of Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war against Ukraine. “The sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, is not just a significant loss, it is emblematic of the shambolic Russian military campaign,” said Michael Kofman, research programme director and Russia expert at the Center for Naval Analyses. Commissioned in 1983, the ship was armed with 16 anti-ship Vulkan cruise missiles with a range of at least 440 miles (700km). According to reports, it was also carrying S-300 anti-air missiles, which are crucial to Russia’s air superiority over Crimea and Ukraine’s Kherson province, now occupied by Russian troops. It is the most significant naval vessel to be sunk since the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano was torpedoed by a British submarine, HMS Conqueror in 1982. It is the first time Moscow has lost a cruiser since German planes sunk the Chervona Ukraina (Red Ukraine) in 1941 at Sevastopol – the same Crimean naval base where the Moskva was being towed towards when it sank. Maksym Marchenko, the Ukrainian governor of the region around Odesa, said the Moskva had been hit by two cruise missiles. “Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage,” he said. Oleksandr Turchynov, a former secretary of the national security and defence council, said Ukraine had hit another Russian ship two weeks ago with a Neptune cruise missile. He said the missile inflicted “significant damage” on the Admiral Essen, “removing it from combat operation”. Western officials described the Ukrainian claims to have hit the Moskva with anti-ship missiles as “credible”. A senior US defence official noted that five other Russian vessels which had been as close as or closer to the Ukrainian coast than the Moskva had moved at least another 20 nautical miles offshore after the explosion, suggesting an effort to get out of range of Ukrainian missiles. “In the wake of the damage that the Moskva experienced, all of the northern Black Sea ships have now moved out, away from that the northern areas they were operating in,” the defence official said. “At this point, we hold them no closer than about 80 nautical miles from the coast. The Moskva gained notoriety early in the war when the crew demanded the surrender of Ukrainian forces on Snake Island, prompting a riposte from one of the border guards on the island: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” The phrase instantly became a symbol of national defiance, and is now a universal meme. The day before the Moskva was sunk, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy unveiled a new postage stamp portraying the ship and the Ukrainian border guard with his middle finger raised. The Moskva had been leading a substantial Russian naval presence in the Black Sea, threatening Ukraine’s southern coast and its key ports. This has been one of the main focuses of the Kremlin’s military efforts, and is aimed at cutting off Ukraine’s access to sea and creating a land bridge from the Crimean peninsula to the Russian border. The Neptune missile which is claimed to have punched a hole in the Moskva’s hull was developed by Ukraine from an old Soviet missile. It is fired from a mobile launcher with a range of a 100km allowing it to be fired from some distance inland. A western official said there was “enormous determination, ingenuity and initiative of Ukrainian forces in order to be able to strike at Russian forces where perhaps they previously thought they were invulnerable, and a significant impact on Russian maritime operations”. Ukraine is reported to have a limited supply of Neptune missiles and has appealed for western supplies of anti-ship weapons. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, promised on a recent visit to Kyiv that British missiles would be made available, but they have not yet arrived. A senior defence official in Washington said Ukrainian soldiers had been trained in the US to use not only Switchblade aerial drones, which have now been sent to Ukraine, but water-borne unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). On Wednesday, Joe Biden approved another $800m in US military assistance to Ukraine, make a total of $2.6bn since the beginning of the war. The new tranche will include longer-range air defence systems than had been previously supplied to Ukraine. “We are working as feverishly as we can to fill those shipments out,” the US defence official said. “We’re under no illusion of the size and the scale of this thing but we also are mindful of the clock. We know time is not our friend, and we’re going to do the best we can to move these shipments as fast as we can and we’re going to front-load them with the kinds of capabilities that we know the Ukrainians need the most.” The equipment so far delivered or pledged by the US includes 16 Mi-17 helicopters, over 700 Switchblade armed drones, over 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, 5,500 Javelin anti-tank missiles, 18 howitzers and 40,000 155mm artillery rounds.",News/World news,Russia says Moskva cruiser has sunk after reported Ukrainian missile strike,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/russia-moskva-cruiser-sunk-stormy-seas-defense-ministry
4/15/2022,"The dueling defamation case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard dug further into the heart of an often toxic and violent relationship on Thursday as jurors heard from the couple’s marriage counsellor, Heard’s former personal assistant and Depp’s addiction specialist. Dr Laurel Anderson, who was employed by Depp and Heard as a counsellor to discuss their relationship, described “mutual abuse” between the two. She said that, on more than one occasion, Heard had initiated incidents to stop Depp leaving, stemming from her fear of abandonment, according to Anderson. She also said she had seen photos of Heard with bruises. “It was a point of pride to Heard, if she felt disrespected, to initiate a fight,” Anderson said. “If he was going to leave her to de-escalate a fight, she would strike him to keep him there. She would rather be in a fight to keep him there.” Meanwhile, Kate James, Amber Heard’s former personal assistant, testified that Heard “felt she had the right to spit in my face” when James asked for a salary increase. She claimed Heard was taking prescription stimulant drugs, sometimes appeared intoxicated, and had a “kick-the-dog kind of relationship” with her sister, Whitney Heard. Heard, she said, often exhibited “manic episodes … similar to if someone was on some kind of amphetamine drug. Moving fast, not making a lot of sense. Hyper-organizing.” James said Heard also became “belligerent and abusive”, would scream at her over the phone, and send abusive text messages at all times of day. “All incoherent. I was just someone to lash out at.” James also testified that Heard had discussed with her taking psychedelic mushrooms, ecstasy and cocaine, and sometimes appeared under the influence of illegal drugs. “Disorientated, partying with friends, lots of heavy drinking, dancing, laughing, playing … all the sorts of things that go hand in hand with drugs,” James said. After police were called following a 21 May 2016 argument at their downtown Los Angeles home, James added, she received an “emergency call” to meet her boss at the Chateau Marmont hotel. She found Heard with four girlfriends who, she said, had spent the day drinking by the pool, James testified. “It seemed a little conspiratorial to me, kind of like a strategy meeting. She’d made it seem like an emergency but it seemed like a pool party.” James, in a video deposition, further added that Heard told her she didn’t enjoy hanging out with her husband’s friends because they were “boring and all old men playing guitars and it wasn’t interesting to her”. James also made no effort to conceal her admiration for Depp, whom she described as “peaceful, calm, shy and almost quiet … he’s such a gentleman, a total southern gentleman”. Coming four days into the trial, James’s testimony marks an escalation in Depp’s legal effort, which has so far been to paint Heard as a schemer who concocted accusations of his abuse against her, and then attempted to hitch those to the #MeToo movement in a Washington Post opinion article which forms the basis of the current defamation case. Much of the former assistant’s testimony to the court in Fairfax, Virginia, was previewed at London’s Royal Courts of Justice last year when James gave evidence that Heard had appropriated her story of being a “sexual violence survivor” during Depp’s unsuccessful libel action against the publisher of the Sun newspaper, after it termed him a “wife-beater”. In that case, James said that Heard had appropriated James’s own experience of being violently raped at machete point in Brazil. “She twisted it into her own story and she used it for her own use,” she said. Efforts by Depp’s legal team to disparage Heard and dismantle her credibility have also come at cost for the actor. In text messages shown to the court a day earlier, the actor referred to her as a “rotting corpse”. That pattern continued on Thursday, with testimony that seemed to show that Depp at that time blamed his drug dependency on his relationship with his wife. Dr David Kipper, Depp’s addiction specialist, testified that he had planned to detox the actor several years ago from dependencies on alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines and cocaine over two weeks on Depp’s island in the Bahamas. “He was concerned he’d never feel normal without his drugs,” Kipper said. In August 2014, Kipper visited Depp on the island to begin the process. The actor reported that he was uncomfortable, and repeatedly tried to fire his doctor and to back out of treatment. “He didn’t want to proceed,” Kipper said. “He didn’t think he could do it.” Back in Los Angeles, Depp was soon drinking at a bar on Sunset Blvd. Kipper’s nurse once found Depp with bloody knuckles after hitting a wall in frustration or anger. On another occasion he kicked in a trailer door on a movie set. The following year, Kipper flew to Australia to tend to the actor. He received a text from Depp asking him to visit and saying he’d cut the top of his finger off during a fight with his wife. “The house was a mess,” Kipper testified. “Things on the floor. Things thrown around. Things were just out of order. It looked to me like there was blood in the wall,” Kipper said. The doctor said he was concerned that Depp was not following his protocols and threatened to withdraw his care in March 2015. Months later Depp texted Kipper placing blame for his Xanax intake on Heard. “Zanax takes the edge off,” he wrote. “I don’t take them all that often, just when my brain is inundated with this badgering and half-truths from my wife.”",Arts/Film,Jury in Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation case hears of ‘mutual abuse’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/14/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-mutual-abuse
4/15/2022,"Absurd though it was that this tie reached extra time, the Rangers support seemed to get added satisfaction from the nature of their team’s success. What a wonderfully fraught occasion this became. For the first time in 14 years Rangers will compete in a European semi-final. That much seemed straightforward for 82 minutes of this Europa League quarter-final second leg, such was the dominance enjoyed by Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side over a Braga team who had been reduced to 10 men before the interval. David Carmo’s late goal forced an added half-hour and rumbles of concern in the stands. Rangers ultimately kept their cool and Braga, who finished the game with nine, lost their heads. So can Rangers prevail where they could not in 2008? “Well, we are getting closer,” said a typically stoical Van Bronckhorst. “You have to push hard until you have the prize and that’s what we are going to do.” The defining goal owed much to blissful simplicity. Fine interplay between Glen Kamara and Joe Aribo led the latter to cross for Kemar Roofe. The scale of celebration – epic, in fact – as Roofe converted was quite a sight. Despite the drama, Rangers are fully deserving of their last-four place; they will not fear Leipzig given they dumped Borussia Dortmund out in an earlier round. With just five minutes played, it seemed strange to envisage what had been a subdued scene around Ibrox before kick-off. The unease, of course, could be attributed to domestic struggles that should result in Celtic reclaiming the Scottish title before long but Rangers have used recent seasons to deliver consistently strong European performances. The in-form Christopher Nkunku sent RB Leipzig through to a Europa League semi-final meeting with Rangers, after his double earned the German side a 2-0 win and 3-1 aggregate victory over Atalanta. After being held to a 1-1 draw in the first leg, Domenico Tedesco's side dominated in Bergamo, deservedly taking the lead when Nkunku (pictured) slotted home from close range in the 18th minute. Atalanta could not get into the game and the French forward sealed victory by winning and converting a late penalty to take his tally to 30 for the season in all competitions. ""It's a fantastic night, it is not easy to win here,"" Tedesco told Uefa.com.""There were no secrets to win, we defended well and unlike the first leg we did well to get past their press."" Reuters Matheus, the Braga goalkeeper, will not count the opening goal anywhere near a collection of his finest moments. After a Borna Barisic cross from the left was flicked goalwards by Aribo, Matheus hesitated rather than beat James Tavernier to the ball. The Rangers captain stole in from full back to blast home from a tight angle. Ibrox erupted. It did so again soon after, Roofe having headed another Barisic ball beyond Matheus from close range. The Braga players instantly and collectively swarmed around the referee, François Letexier; the protests were deemed valid after Roofe’s goal was ruled out via VAR for a handball by Barisic. Roofe came within the underside of the crossbar of doubling the Rangers lead. The former Leeds man should really have scored. Braga’s approach was interesting in the sense that it allowed Rangers to fire cross after cross into the penalty area. For the first half hour, this looked a bizarre tactic. The Portuguese looked panic-stricken each time Barisic or Tavernier tried to find Roofe from the flanks. Braga had offering nothing whatsoever in attack. Rangers were to claim the second goal their first-half dominance merited. Barisic chipped a pass from deep between the Braga defenders that allowed Roofe to capitalise. The forward was pushed over by Vitor Tormena, who was dismissed for a clear foul. Tavernier stepped forward after the dust had settled to stroke the penalty beyond Matheus. Rangers’ next task was to settle the tie, a scenario that looked imminent as they continued to exert control in the early stages of the second period. Aribo curled wide after starting and closing a sweeping move. If there was underlying Ibrox concern, it had foundation in the enforced absence of the prolific striker Alfredo Morelos. Minus him, it is always possible Rangers will suffer through bluntness. Connor Goldson attempted to offset any nerves, the centre-back’s snap-shot flying wide off Matheus’s upright, Aaron Ramsey headed over from Barisic’s cross and lashed a subsequent opportunity into side netting. Roofe had his second goal of the evening chalked off, this time for offside after he lobbed the advancing Matheus. Tempers frayed in the immediate aftermath as the Braga substitute Vitinha was accused of catching Goldson in an aerial challenge. The officials shrugged off the incident. Van Bronckhorst had little cause to fear a late Braga hurrah but that was what happened. Carmo leapt unchallenged to nod past Allan McGregor from six yards and a corner. The Rangers goalkeeper had been a spectator for the previous 82 minutes. Braga’s small contingent leapt about giddy in the corner and no wonder. Elation matched disbelief. Roofe had a lucky escape from a second yellow card before his key involvement. Instead, after he sent Rangers 3-1 ahead on the night it was Braga who had their numbers further reduced. Iuri Medeiros lunged into Leon Balogun before protesting vehemently in Letexier’s face. A double booking was swiftly issued. There ended Braga’s semi-final dreams.",Sport/Football,Rangers roar into semi-finals as Roofe sees off nine-man Braga in extra time,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/rangers-braga-europa-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report
4/15/2022,"In the aftermath of the Brooklyn subway shooting, social media has found its latest star. Zack Tahhan, 21, was quickly anointed as a hero on Wednesday following the arrest of Frank R James, the suspect in the attack that injured 29. But the real story, it seems, was more complicated – and Tahhan wasn’t the day’s only hero. But he has certainly made the biggest splash. In videos that quickly spread on Twitter, Tahhan explains that he spotted James on security cameras. “I thought, ‘Oh shit, this guy, let me call the police,’” he says in one clip. He was soon telling his story to a gaggle of reporters in Manhattan’s East Village before heading off in a police car, waving as onlookers cheered. Thank you for your bravery today, Zack.All of New York is grateful. https://t.co/YPcU1EQO7p Since then, media reports have established Tahhan as a security camera technician from Syria who arrived in the US five years ago and speaks five languages. “We got him, thank God,” he told USA Today. “Oh, I do my best.” Videos featuring Tahhan’s upbeat tale received tens of thousands of likes and retweets, and he has inspired a hashtag, #ThankYouZack, and a GoFundMe. “This is what a hero looks like,” tweeted one poster. “Give this guy a TV show please,” added another. “I’m loving that people who were prevented from entering this country a few years ago are recognized for their heroism,” wrote another admirer of Tahhan, who said he was in the midst of fasting for Ramadan. Not only did he help catch the New York subway shooter, he's provided me with my new fave Ramadan meme. #ThankYouZack pic.twitter.com/dycWcT2Z4w Others reminded authorities to give Tahhan a $50,000 reward police promised for assistance in James’s capture. And the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, thanked Tahhan for his bravery: “All of New York is grateful.” Since Wednesday, however, reports have portrayed a more complex scene – and introduced a few more stars to the cast. A New York police spokesperson told the Guardian any tips were confidential. But police sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that James called the police himself. He said they could find him at a McDonald’s in the East Village, the sources said. But when they got there, he wasn’t there, the chief of department, Kenneth Corey, told the agency. He was seen on a nearby street corner and police arrested him. However, several local people say they chipped into the effort. Tahhan credited his cousin Mo Cheikh with helping, telling PIX11 that the two of them had spotted James. Lee Vasu, a painter and gallery owner, told Artnet he had recognized James while walking with his family in the area. “I told my wife, ‘The subway shooter is right behind us. Go fast. Push the baby. No time for argument. Go,’” he said. After making sure they were safe, he said, he ran back toward James and notified a police officer – though others had also noticed him by that point. “I was looking at him as if I was drawing him,” Vasu told the site. “As an artist, you study every facial feature really well. I looked at him for quite a while and then half an hour later, there he was. You can’t escape an artist in the East Village.” Meanwhile, Francisco Puebla, manager of a nearby hardware store, was also on the case, he told the New York Times. Puebla had hired Tahhan to work on his store’s security cameras. “He’s all over social media,” Puebla said, “but I’m the one who took action.” Still, speaking to USA Today, he portrayed it as a team effort. After spotting James, he said, he asked the two people working on the security system – apparently including Tahhan – “to confirm with me if it was the same guy”. They agreed, “and then we looked at each other and we said, ‘Let’s call the police,’ but I said ‘You call,’ and they said, ‘No, you call.’” They didn’t want to get the wrong person into trouble, he said. Finally he approached a police car that had stopped nearby with the information. Ultimately, as the writer Rachel Handler, who lives locally and shops at the store, put it in Curbed: “the whole thing was a moment of beautiful New York City teamwork.”",News/US news,Zack Tahhan is being hailed for his NYPD tipoff.

4/15/2022,"As Mark Noble prepared to enter the pitch with 14 minutes left he could have been forgiven if his mind had drifted back to the bad old days. Noble knows better than anyone that West Ham were a shambles not so long ago, until David Moyes arrived to instil stability and togetherness, and it is doubtful that the veteran midfielder ever imagined his final season as a professional would involve his boyhood club embarking on an adventure that could end with them cavorting around with the Europa League trophy in Seville next month. Yet this is what West Ham have become under Moyes. This is why their disbelieving fans say they are massive. There is a defiance to this team, a refusal to wilt under pressure, but there is quality too. This run is not a fluke. West Ham had already defied expectations by beating Sevilla last month and, although they will need to be good again when they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the last four, they deserve to be seen as a genuine European force after the way they took Lyon apart on an astonishing night at the Groupama Stadium. It was difficult to think of many better away performances under Moyes, whose plan worked to perfection. Clinical goals from Craig Dawson, Declan Rice and Jarrod Bowen were no more than West Ham deserved. Their blend of physical power and counter-attacking prowess was too much for Lyon, who will regret not capitalising on playing the entire second half of last week’s first leg at the London Stadium against 10 men, and as Moyes pointed out it would not have been possible without a storming display from Michail Antonio, whose hold-up play up front utterly flummoxed Castello Lukeba and Jason Denayer. “I’m extremely proud,” said Moyes, who was also delighted with how his side coped with three key defenders missing. Before kick-off it had been hard not to wonder how West Ham would fare without Kurt Zouma and Angelo Ogbonna in central defence and the suspended Aaron Cresswell at left-back. A centre-back partnership of Dawson and Issa Diop in a European quarter-final? Surely the run was going to come to an end. By the end of the night, however, Moyes was praising Diop for overcoming a shaky start and talking about how Dawson is getting better with every game. West Ham had stood firm. They had survived a torrid opening spell in which Karl Toko Ekambi had struck the woodwork for Lyon, Vladimir Coufal had escaped a penalty appeal for handball and Diop had picked up a booking for a clumsy foul on Moussa Dembélé. “Lyon played really well for 25 minutes,” Moyes said, but it was not enough. After a while West Ham began to impose themselves, Manuel Lanzini knitting things together in the middle, and their threat grew whenever they were able to work Antonio into dangerous positions. The in-form Christopher Nkunku sent RB Leipzig through to a Europa League semi-final meeting with Rangers, after his double earned the German side a 2-0 win and 3-1 aggregate victory over Atalanta. After being held to a 1-1 draw in the first leg, Domenico Tedesco's side dominated in Bergamo, deservedly taking the lead when Nkunku (pictured) slotted home from close range in the 18th minute. Atalanta could not get into the game and the French forward sealed victory by winning and converting a late penalty to take his tally to 30 for the season in all competitions. ""It's a fantastic night, it is not easy to win here,"" Tedesco told Uefa.com.""There were no secrets to win, we defended well and unlike the first leg we did well to get past their press."" Reuters Lyon were terrified of the striker’s pace. Antonio was involved when the tireless Pablo Fornals had a shot from 20 yards and he almost created the opening goal with a cross for Bowen, who was unlucky not to turn the ball home at the far post. West Ham were growing in confidence at that stage. Rice and Tomáš Souček were outplaying Tanguy Ndombele and Thiago Mendes in midfield, and Lyon were looking vulnerable under the high ball. Set-pieces were an obvious path to goal for West Ham, and so it proved when Fornals sent in a corner after 38 minutes. Dawson simply wanted it more than Lyon’s defenders and his header meant West Ham were ahead on aggregate. Lyon, whose fans disgraced themselves by fighting with security staff after full-time, cracked again before half-time. Ben Johnson, filling in for Cresswell, crossed from the left and Emerson Palmieri’s poor clearance was collected by Rice on the edge of the area. He took a touch and sent a low shot beyond Julian Pollersbeck, who was deputising for the injured Anthony Lopes in goal. Rice ran the length of the pitch to celebrate with West Ham’s disbelieving travelling support and the home fans fell silent. This was not in the script and Peter Bosz responded at the break by replacing Ndombele and Romain Faivre with Tetê and Lucas Paquetá, who was in the squad despite reportedly testing positive for Covid yesterday morning. Yet West Ham were in their element. Three minutes into the second half they stopped a Lyon attack and countered when Rice, Fornals and Lanzini played their way out of trouble and found Antonio. He found Fornals and when the Spaniard sent Bowen clear all that was left was for the winger to score with a calm finish from 20 yards. The tie was over: West Ham were too professional to let go of their lead.

4/15/2022,"Almost exactly 27 years to the day since the former chief executive of the Rugby Football League, Maurice Lindsay, unveiled the grand plans for the advent of Super League and the proposed continental expansion which came with it, few should have afforded themselves a smile more than Lindsay here as history was made, with two French sides facing one another in the competition for the first time. The original plans for the first Super League season in 1996 included two French teams, Toulouse and Paris. That ultimately never materialised, with Toulouse not making it to the start line and Paris Saint-Germain lasting barely a couple of seasons. But here, the vision and belief so many traditionalists laughed at for years, the notion that two French teams could stand side by side in the elite competition, finally came to fruition as Catalans hosted Toulouse: and it was a moment for all of rugby league, not just those in France, to savour. “This is brother versus brother,” the Catalans Dragons chief executive, Alex Chan, admits. “We have to work together and not discredit each other as clubs. If we don’t look after Toulouse and they don’t work with us, we won’t grow in France. The vision was laid out all those years ago. They called the competition Super League Europe and now, it truly is a European competition.” The result here was almost secondary to the occasion, with the Dragons edging a hard-fought contest 18-10. These are fascinating times for rugby league across the Channel. Toulouse’s promotion to Super League for the first time comes not only in a World Cup year, but just three years out from the next hosting of the tournament, which will take place in France in 2025. “There’s a super relationship between both clubs,” Catalans’ head coach Steve McNamara says. “We’re aware of the importance of us both being in the elite competition and what that can bring across France and for other French clubs with a World Cup on the horizon here. There’s huge mutual respect for one another.” That respect disappeared on occasions on Thursday evening in a tempestuous and ill-tempered game, perhaps the least you would have expected from two French sides who play with passion in abundance. Catalans appeared in control in the early stages of the second half when they forged an 18-6 lead, but the red card of Joe Chan gave Toulouse a glimmer of hope. They, however, could not complete the comeback. Catalans’ success in recent seasons, winning the Challenge Cup in 2018 and making last season’s Grand Final, has boosted interest in the sport in Perpignan. But this felt altogether more significant in terms of the plans to grow the game across France, though you feel Toulouse’s continued involvement in Super League beyond this year will play a huge role in that long-term goal for rugby league to spread out of the north of England even more. “If we want the game to grow, we have to stay up,” Toulouse’s Tony Gigot says. “We can be stronger for each other and we need two good teams, and more French players to break through and play. That can only help French rugby league.” Alex Chan agrees: “The grassroots game in France needs an injection of positivity like this, to show there’s a reason we want youngsters to come and play. We want to put this product out to the world and show them that France is at the heart of rugby league.” Those close to the Catalans say that local interest in the buildup to this match eclipsed any ordinary Super League game against English opposition. The locals certainly enjoyed what was a momentous occasion but despite this being billed as a central part of the “Rivals Round”, these clubs have a much stronger bond than mere rivals. Together, they could potentially determine whether, 27 years after Lindsay’s initial vision, Super League can finally escape the constraints of its roots.",Sport/Sport,‘Brother versus brother’: Super League revels in first all-French derby,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/super-league-revels-in-first-all-french-derby-catalans-toulouse
4/15/2022,"Boxing’s embarrassing determination to avoid the unpalatable truth about its often tawdry business was laid bare on Thursday evening during a media conference call to publicise the world heavyweight title fight between Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium on 23 April. Earlier this week the biggest boxing news story of the year broke when the US Treasury announced that they had imposed harsh sanctions against Daniel Kinahan, one of the most powerful men in the sport, who has acted as a confidante and adviser to Fury and many other leading fighters in Britain and the United States. The US government also warned all fighters and promoters who have worked with Kinahan to cut ties with him owing to his alleged leadership of a criminal cartel. Yet, on a Zoom call featuring up to a hundred journalists, not one question was put to Fury, or his promoters Bob Arum and Frank Warren, about the damage done to boxing’s already battered reputation. Those reporters invited to offer their queries to Fury chose to focus exclusively on routine questions about the buildup to the fight and the world champion’s exuberant mood as he prepares to defend his titles against Whyte before a crowd of 94,000 a week on Saturday. Meanwhile, journalists who work outside the parochial boxing media, and were itching to ask Fury how he felt about the sanctions imposed on Kinahan, were left frustrated. All the media were muted until called and so there was no way of breaking the omerta of silence that engulfs boxing when it comes to discussing the deeply troubling influence of Kinahan. Based in Dubai, and in exile from his native Ireland where he and his family face multiple allegations of criminal activity, Kinahan has been a source of great support to multiple boxers. They all swear by his loyalty and generosity to them. Last year Fury took to social media to praise the crucial role Kinahan had played in arranging a hugely lucrative showdown between him and Anthony Joshua. That fight failed to materialise after a US judge ruled that Fury was contractually bound to meet Deontay Wilder first. Since then Kinahan’s power base in boxing has spread significantly and two companies closely associated with him, MTK and Probellum, have expanded. Kinahan, who has no criminal convictions, has always denied any wrongdoing. Last month it seemed as if he had taken another giant step forward in his concerted campaign to clean up his reputation. Mauricio Sulaiman, the head of the World Boxing Council, lamented the fact that Kinahan was “a character who has been crossed out and labelled as a person linked to criminal groups, thus creating prejudice against a large part of the world boxing community.” Sulaiman defended Kinahan vigorously and stressed he “will have our full support in his quest to bring benefits to boxing.” Yet this week in Dublin, at a very different kind of press conference, the US government offered a reward of $5m for information that would lead to the financial disruption or the arrest or conviction of Kinahan, his father, his brother and four of their associates. Gregory Gatjanis, an associate director of the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, said the Kinahan cartel would now be prioritised by US law enforcement in the same way it had pursued the Italian Camorra, the Yakuza mafia of Japan and the Russian Izmaylovskaya. On Thursday evening, in the muted and fawning world of Zoom, it was as if this story had never happened. Fury is a highly intelligent world champion who has done substantial work in developing a wider understanding of mental health. He is confident and smart enough to deal with almost any media query. It would have been fascinating to hear Fury’s thoughts on the seismic events of this week – both for Kinahan and for boxing. Instead there was hot air and silence. An eminent news and investigative journalist, who works outside of the red-light district of boxing, had waited an hour to ask a question. Like so many, his opportunity never came and so he wrote just one accurate word to the rest of us on the call: “Embarrassing.”",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury pre-fight Zoom conference ducks questions over Daniel Kinahan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/embarrassing-boxing-ignores-daniel-kinahan-questions-in-tyson-fury-dillian-whyte-buildup
4/15/2022,"The business case for the proposed Urannah dam in north Queensland – backed by a $483m federal government grant announced last month – reveals the project has been designed to support a massive future expansion of coalmining in the Bowen Basin. Taxpayer funding to the Urannah project has been described as “brazenly political” and was announced before the National Water Grid advisory body, now disbanded, had been able to scrutinise a detailed business case. The proponent’s business case has since been released, prompting concerns about the economic return on investment. It said that over 30 years, local communities would obtain 95c of economic benefit from every dollar spent. Supporting studies show the stated economic benefit is underpinned by assumptions that more water would support the intensification of coalmining – and the development of new mines – in the Queensland Bowen basin. The studies use assumptions from a 2018 report for the mining lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia, including predictions that metallurgical coal exports would grow by 113m tonnes, or “the equivalent of a large export mine being added to the market every year to 2030”. As a result, the Urannah business case assumes a growth in mining – and associated water demand – until 2049. Tim Buckley, an energy market analyst, said the assumption was “ludicrous” and the market demand for metallurgical coal would, according to a modelling by the International Energy Agency, likely decrease by 57% over the longer term. “We don’t need more dams for coking coal, we need enabling investment to catalyse the new massive zero-emissions industries of the future, where the job opportunities are literally in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” Buckley said. “Why are we planning on building more stranded assets rather than building more assets of the future?” When the proponent, Bowen River Utilities, conducted “market sounding” for the Urannah project by talking to potential water customers, it spoke to 13 potential industrial users – all coalmines in the Bowen Basin. The Urannah business case predicts $555m of new economic benefit in the mining sector as a result of the dam project and an additional $727m from agriculture. Guardian Australia reported on Thursday that companies linked to Urannah project had donated more than $150,000 to the Queensland Liberal National party, and that the wife of the federal MP Julian Simmonds is working for the proponent as its communications manager. A spokesperson for Bowen River Utilities said John Cotter Jr, the sole director of the company, “has made donations to both the ALP and the LNP, all of which have been publicly declared (with) the Electoral Commission Queensland and Australian Electoral Commission”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Conservation groups said the extent to which the project was designed to facilitate the expansion of Queensland coalmining meant it could be used to campaign against inner-city Liberals – including Simmonds, who represents the green-tinged west Brisbane electorate of Ryan. Simmonds has been contacted for comment. Dave Copeman, the head of the Queensland Conservation Council, said connections between the LNP and destructive projects “demonstrates yet again that the party has a serious credibility problem when it asks voters to take it seriously as taking action on climate” When the federal government announced funding ahead of the federal budget, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the project would “provide a secure and affordable water supply for mining, industrial and urban use”. Bowen River Utilities did not respond to a specific offer to comment about the extent to which the project relied upon the expansion of coalmining. A spokesperson has previously said: “The Urannah Dam will transform the Greater Whitsunday region and deliver thousands of jobs, water security, reliable renewable energy and enormous economic benefits for North Queensland taxpayer”. “That’s why it is backed by regional communities who have a real determination driving us to build this project. “The dam also has bipartisan support from all three levels of government.”",News/Australia news,Urannah dam business case assumes massive growth in Queensland coalmining,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/urannah-dam-business-case-assumes-massive-growth-in-queensland-coalmining
4/15/2022,"Kate Grenville has been unsettling conventional narratives of colonial Australia since the publication of her 2005 novel The Secret River, which drew on her own family history. So far, this has been a fictional project: in her novels, Grenville asks what role stories have to play in the way we understand history and what new perspectives on the truth might be offered by fiction. Her work has unnerved some historians, who have been uncomfortable with the idea that she might claim a status for her novels equal to historical truth. This misreading of her project is one that Grenville seemed to poke fun at in her most recent novel, A Room Made of Leaves, with the conceit that the novel was really a secret manuscript written by the early Australian settler Elizabeth Macarthur, then hidden for years in an attic. Grenville’s fictional Elizabeth revealed her feelings about her irascible husband, the colonist John Macarthur, and her struggle to make a life in the new colony. With Elizabeth Macarthur’s Letters, Grenville does what she was just pretending to do in A Room Made of Leaves: she acts as editor and transcriber – and many ways, translator – of Elizabeth’s real epistles. More than 250 years after she was born, Elizabeth finally speaks in her own voice, no longer ventriloquized through a novelist’s imagination. And yet, what does it mean for historical documents to speak for themselves, Grenville asks? What do Elizabeth’s letters have to say, if we attend to the complexity of voice, the workings of irony and literary deflection? On the surface, as Grenville acknowledges, many of these letters are surprisingly bland and seldom offer insight into the turbulent times or the woman herself – although later in life, as her husband’s mental illness progressed to extreme paranoia, Elizabeth’s anguish and “great grief” are more plainly expressed. Grenville believes that these documents are themselves a kind of fiction, a “mask of demure formality” hiding a woman who was not able to openly show the shrewd wit and penetrating intelligence that occasionally flashes through. This mask was adopted, Grenville argues, at least partly in response to the myriad constraints on writing, not least the fact that Elizabeth’s letters were not private; her husband most likely read them, and they would have been also read by a sphere of acquaintance around the addressee. In contemporary terms, these letters are more like social media posts made on a person’s public profile rather than a discreet direct message. The correspondence collected here spans Elizabeth’s first extant letter, addressed to her mother as Elizabeth is about to leave England with her husband and sail to the brand-new colony of New South Wales in 1789, to one of the last she wrote to her son Edward before her death in 1850. Grenville provides a short introduction to each letter, and the vivid energy of the volume derives from the fascinating dialogue between these two voices: the colonial wife, writing to family and friends alike in achingly constrained prose; and the contemporary novelist who is by turns obsessed, compelled, and discomforted by her enigmatic subject. John Macarthur has taken all the credit for establishing the wool industry in Australia, but Grenville points out that he was away in England for long periods during the most crucial phase of this development. In his absence, Elizabeth oversaw all aspects of the Macarthur estate, which became a massively complex enterprise. Grenville explores the disjunction between this reality and Elizabeth’s careful representation of herself as “timid and irresolute”; a modest, subordinate wife. She was one of those clever, unconventional women who have always been of interest to Grenville, and this collection displays the author’s inner conflict as her admiration for Elizabeth vies with critique of this woman whose advancement was conditional on the oppression of others. Grenville does not attempt to gloss over or excuse Elizabeth’s indifference to enslaved people and contempt towards Australia’s Indigenous population, so very different from the compassionate attitude Grenville gave her in her novel. “She could have had a more humane perspective,” Grenville admits, “and I wish she had.” Grenville makes her argument with the delicate skill of a literary scholar, but invites the reader into a zone of doubt, uncertainty, and disquiet that feels entirely belonging to a novelist. She constantly questions her own reading, allowing for the possibility of other perspectives, other truths. We have the fictional, hot-blooded version of Elizabeth constructed in A Room Made of Leaves, born from Grenville’s fascination with a single, erotic “blush” confessed in one of the letters collected here. And we have these letters, which “give readers a chance to decide for themselves,” as Grenville says. In the counterpoint between them, she offers a compelling perspective on the author’s dialogue with a elusive, complicated subject. Elizabeth Macarthur’s Letters, edited by Kate Grenville, is published by Text Publishing ($34.99).",Arts/Books,"Elizabeth Macarthur’s Letters, edited by Kate Grenville review – a fascinating dialogue",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/15/elizabeth-macarthurs-letters-edited-by-kate-grenville-review-a-fascinating-dialogue
4/15/2022,"Scott Morrison’s hand-picked candidate in McMahon accused Narendra Modi of causing “hatred [and] fear” in India and accused him of being “unable to do a press conference at all for fear of being asked a Gujrat or Delhi or All India genocide question”. Although Vivek Singha’s social media advocacy is unlikely to be decisive in the relatively safe New South Wales Labor seat, the strident criticism of the Indian prime minister could be a source of a significant embarrassment for Morrison, who has closely courted Modi. Singha, a tax specialist at PepsiCo, contested the seat for the Liberals in 2019, achieving a 5.5% swing against the incumbent, shadow climate change minister Chris Bowen. He was one of the nine candidates selected by a three-person committee including Morrison and the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, just a week before the 21 May election was called. On his now-deleted Twitter account, Singha was a frequent antagonist of the Indian PM, whose office and personal accounts have a total of 125.8 million followers. COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking.Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood.We are in this together: PM @narendramodi In April 2019 when Modi’s official account tweeted that Covid “does not see race, religion, colour caste, [or] creed”, Singha replied “shame that you have divided the country to such an extent that you had to resort to tweeting this”. “Sad how much hatred, fear, hunger [and] disappointment you have caused.” Modi is a Hindu nationalist who came to power in 2014, despite questions over his complicity in the 2002 Gujarat riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, while he was chief minister. Modi has always denied any wrongdoing. Ethnic and religious violence have been on the rise in India, where there are accusations that state police are “mercenaries” of the hardline Hindu nationalist government, and have murdered Muslims and Dalits. On 21 April 2020, Singha suggested that Modi was “unable to do a press conference at all for fear of being asked a Gujrat or Delhi or All India genocide question”. A day earlier, when another tweeter said that “since 2002 fame Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, India has lost its virtues”, Singha replied: “True.” Singha also repeatedly criticised Modi’s Covid policies, including, on 22 March 2020, a 14-hour curfew to prepare the nation for later lockdowns. Singha questioned why Modi was “so fearful of closing down the country” and why he had imposed a “practice” when India was facing a “real test”. “He is cheating the nation … lulling people into a false sense of security.” “This looks like [it] is turning into a huge fundraiser from [Modi’s] tweets,” Singha posted in reference to the curfew. “Is this a corona mitigation measure or an invite to corona,” he queried, in reference to large crowds at train stations and airports before the curfew. In July 2020, when the Bharatiya Janata Party tweeted images of Modi purportedly visiting the “Nimu forward post in Ladakh”, Singha replied with a Google maps search suggesting that the prime minister was five hours and 45 minutes drive away. In April 2020, Singha congratulated communist candidate Rakesh Singha, a family member, on his election to the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly. Under Morrison and Modi’s leadership Australia and India have pursued closer ties, including a free trade agreement and cooperation on security through the Quad as a counterweight to China. Morrison has lavished praise on Modi, including describing him as “an empowered and visionary leader” at a virtual summit with the Indian PM in June 2020. In November, Morrison described Modi as his “very good friend”, “a great leader, internationally” and “a strong leader who believes passionately in the principles of democracy and the future of his country”. Earlier in April, Morrison defended his intervention in the NSW Liberal branch, boasting that taking control of preselections had resulted in half of all candidates being women. “Of those, they came from Vietnamese, Indian, Chinese backgrounds, as well as Sri Lankan and Croatian. “I think the candidates that we’ve chosen, I’d like the members to be able to do that, but we were running out of time. The job had to get done.” A Liberal Party spokesman said: “Mr Singha is a strong supporter of Australia’s close and warm relationship with the nation of India and its government.”",News/Australia news,Morrison’s captain’s pick for NSW seat accused Indian PM of causing ‘hatred and fear’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/morrisons-captains-pick-for-nsw-seat-accused-indian-pm-of-causing-hatred-and-fear
4/15/2022,"The national academics’ union is urging the university sector to pave the way for nation-leading gender affirmation leave in Australia. The issue has been highlighted by University of Melbourne staff calling for paid gender transition leave as part of negotiations on a new three-year enterprise agreement, first reported by the Age. The National Tertiary Education Union, which is representing staff, will also ask for employees to be given the right to reject 26 January as a public holiday and take their entitled leave on a different day. The move would allow staff who viewed the date as “Invasion Day” and support the First Nations-driven movement to treat it as an ordinary working day. But associate professor at University of Queensland’s law school Paul Harpur, warned swapping leave days could result in the number of public holidays being decreased in future enterprise negotiations. “I don’t think it’s in the union’s best interests,’ he said. “At the moment, it’s a legislated day, you’ve got to have legislative protection, if you reduce it to a bargaining, I think it could lead to unfortunate outcomes.” The union’s log of claims propose 30 days of paid gender transition leave be made available to staff. NTEU Victorian division assistant secretary, Sarah Roberts, said the university sector could become a leader on gender transition leave to allow them to undertake psychological and medical treatment. “With gender affirmation leave, I think there’s a push across progressive areas to have this recognised as a form of leave,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It was a kind of move in the trade union movement to recognise domestic violence leave in a similar way in past rounds of bargaining. And we see that more and more becoming commonplace in collective agreements across the economy.” Roberts believed it was likely there would be interest from staff at other universities keen to pursue similar arrangements relating to the Australia Day public holiday. “Given the level of public interest that there’s been in, it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s been other NTEU branches that prick up their ears and consider this to be an opportunity for them to pursue,” she said. Roberts said it would allow staff the option to stand in solidarity and recognise the pain of their Indigenous colleagues, some of whom view 26 January as a day of mourning. “In the union movement and across social movements, more generally, we talk about it as invasion day. In recognition of that day, being a day of the sorrow and horror and pain for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander colleagues,” she said. Roberts said the idea stemmed from clauses in public service enterprise agreements. In the Victorian public service’s workplace agreement, employees can, in agreement with their employer, substitute another day for any public holidays to observe religious or cultural occasions or like reasons of significance to the employee. Some APS enterprise agreements contain a similar clause. A spokesperson for the University of Melbourne said the NTEU has not yet shared its proposed claims with the institution. “Nor has it responded to the University’s longstanding invitation to commence bargaining, which is the appropriate forum for discussing and resolving these matters,” they said. “We look forward to bargaining in good faith with the union and staff on a new enterprise agreement.”",News/Australia news,University of Melbourne staff push for paid gender transition leave and flexible approach to Australia Day,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/university-of-melbourne-staff-push-for-paid-gender-transition-leave-and-flexible-approach-to-australia-day
4/15/2022,"An urgent review of “totally inadequate” boarding house inspection practices has been launched by the Inner West council following the fatal fire at a property that claimed three lives in Newtown last month. Mayor Darcy Byrne has also written to the New South Wales government to request a joint review of boarding house regulation in a bid to make the last resort housing measures safer and fairer. The fire – that police allege was deliberately lit by a former resident who has been charged with three counts of murder – also prompted the council to inspect three other boarding houses owned by Albert Wong, who owned the Newtown property. Guardian Australia does not suggest the condition of the home was a factor in the fatal fire, or that Wong was responsible for the fire. The Inner West council has confirmed the property had passed its most recent fire inspection and had a current fire compliance certificate. Inspectors allegedly uncovered breaches of state regulations at three of his Petersham and Stanmore properties and have issued statutory orders for urgent structural and electrical repair work, as well as general cleaning. “Mr Wong is now working with council to resolve these matters,” a statement from council read. If the orders are not complied with, the council will consider issuing fines or taking civil enforcement action. Wong did not respond to requests for comment. Byrne wrote to the premier, Dominic Perrottet, in March requesting state government assistance on a joint review of the regulation and management of the sector, and has commissioned a council-led review of its own systems while he awaits response. He said the tragedy in Newtown had shone a light on conditions in boarding houses. “We must not look away from this problem but instead investigate and confront it. We can’t afford to wait for more fires or fatalities.” About 3,000 people are believed to be living in more than 300 registered boarding homes across the inner west local government area – accounting for more than a fifth of NSW’s boarding house stock. Under state law, local councils are responsible for approving new boarding houses and enforcing safety and accommodation standards, with powers to fine operators for breaking the code. But with such an uneven distribution of boarding homes between council areas, Byrne said the burden was proving too much for his council, and the current system was “totally inadequate”. “I’m concerned that we’re not getting to inspect enough properties frequently enough, and that there are a lot of safety issues being encountered by residents which are going undetected or unreported,” he said. “If we’re going to have boarding houses as a place of last resort, then there’s got to be a proper system of regulation and compliance, in which we make sure that the properties are in decent working order, and that people are not being mistreated by their landlords.” Newtown Neighbourhood Centre advocates for the rights of boarding house residents and most recently worked with emergency services to find housing for the men who lost everything in the Newtown fire. Centre chief executive, Liz Yeo, told Guardian Australia at the time of the blaze that the property was “cramped, crowded” and “in a dilapidated state”. While she wants to see the standard for boarding houses lifted across the board, she has warned against drastic action that does not include a major boost to public housing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If you go and shut down every boarding house that doesn’t meet the standard that you or I might consider would be acceptable, you’re going to have a lot more people sleeping on the street,” Yeo said. “This is a real dilemma in this space, and that’s why there does need to be an increased supply of social and affordable housing. “We’re not saying boarding houses shouldn’t exist. There is still a place for them. But if there was a better supply [of affordable housing], we would have less of these issues.” The state government has been contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,Boarding house regulations in Sydney’s inner west under review after fatal Newtown fire ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/boarding-house-regulations-in-sydneys-inner-west-under-review-after-fatal-newtown-fire
4/15/2022,"Curtin is the type of safe seat that doesn’t normally see or hear a lot from politicians. “I’ve been here for 17 years, I’ve never met one,” says a local men’s hairstylist, Peter Alan. “I find it a bit weird that, as a business owner, I’ve never seen a politician.” Liberal or conservative since its creation in 1949, the blue-ribbon seat in Perth’s affluent western suburbs takes in the inner-suburban and beachside areas between the Swan River and the Indian Ocean. The former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was the local member here for 11 years. Tom, a retired geologist stopping to talk at Sculpture by the Sea, cites the fact that Cottesloe, within the boundaries of Curtin, was one of just two state seats to return a Liberal in Mark McGowan’s landslide 2021 election. “We only see [politicians] at election time, and only in the letterbox,” Tom says. But things are a little different this time. “The Liberal party has sent us three lots of stuff, usually we don’t hear from them at all until the week before the election,” says Tom’s wife, Marie. “We’ve had more [contact] this year than ever before.” There is a good reason for that. The Liberal MP who succeeded Bishop, Celia Hammond, holds Curtin with a margin of 13.9%. But she faces a challenge from the independent Kate Chaney, one of a crop of mostly inner-city independents backed by Climate 200 who are running on a platform of greater action on climate change and integrity in politics. Chaney brings a cohort of a dozen volunteers with her to Cottesloe beach, projecting the image of a people-powered campaign as Sculpture by the Sea officials hover nervously, warning against turning the event into a political sideshow. The candidate tells Guardian Australia she’s running on the “huge economic opportunities arising out of decarbonisation” as Western Australia could become “a renewable energy force”. According to Chaney, Curtin voters are less focused on “hyper-local” issues and more on “systemic change on macro issues”, such as climate and integrity. In short, they are post-material – and can well afford to be, in an electorate dominated by professionals and managers, who together make up more than half of employed people. In Curtin, the median household income is $2,052 a week, well above the Australian average of $1,438. Voters say Curtin felt well-served by Bishop. At the Floreat Forum shopping centre near Hammond’s electorate office, Jennifer Stacey says it “seemed to mean a lot, when Julie Bishop was there”. “People would say, ‘Oh, we’ve got someone sitting in cabinet’ – now I’m not really sure what that person [Hammond] is doing, what sort of influence they have.” Stacey is a progressive voter who says she votes “out of protest against the Liberals” because they seem to take the seat for granted – but she hasn’t heard of Chaney, whose campaign did not kick off until late January. “I think we would need to be aware of them now, it’s a bit concerning – it’s a bit late in the race to not be,” Stacey says. But others have heard about the alternative. At a cafe in Subiaco, Andrew, a resident of the suburb for 40 years, is poring over an article in the West Australian about the local contest. He says the Liberals seem “a bit concerned about this new lady” as Chaney appears to be “nipping away” at their large margin. “She’s got so many of the billboards around the electorate already – she’s got an active group to assist her.” Andrew says he is from a farming community originally, noting that farmers are “critically aware” of climate change. He says Curtin could go the same way as Warringah, where Zali Steggall “took out a Liberal” – the former prime minister Tony Abbott. “The Liberal government is seen to be dragging their feet a bit on [climate change]. Particularly before they went to Glasgow – they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to net zero by 2050.” “I don’t think Hammond has done a great deal,” Andrew says. “She came from a Catholic university, which were quite anti-women’s rights – that doesn’t gel with me. She hasn’t had a high profile.” Marie, a high school teacher, says she is “disappointed by some of [Hammond’s] voting patterns”. “I’m not happy with their policies on refugees, and some of the religious legislation I didn’t approve of at all,” she says. Hammond pushes back against the characterisation of being a conservative in a moderate Liberal area, saying “assumptions are made” and a reputation can “take on a life of its own and becomes an accepted truth, even if it’s not”. The 53-year-old says her reported views – which include downplaying humanity’s contribution to the climate crisis and concerns about premarital sex and militant feminism – have changed. “That’s what growth and learning and compassion and being with people is all about,” she says. “But I’m still fundamentally the same person, and I don’t actually label myself anything. So when it was put to me that I was conservative as opposed to moderate, my response is I’m a Liberal.” Hammond says it is “well known that I was part of a group of Liberal MPs who advocated strongly for the commitment to a net zero by 2050 and with a detailed plan”. She says before she was a politician, negative campaigning didn’t speak to her, so she wants a positive campaign about what she can deliver – but she will “call out and contest” ideas with the other candidates. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Both campaigns are drawing a sharp contrast where they need to. The Liberals have targeted Chaney for her one-time membership of the Labor party, which Chaney explains she joined “briefly” before leaving, dismayed by “tribalism”. Chaney criticises Hammond for having “spoken recently” about the need for more action on climate change and a stronger integrity commission: “The reality is we’ve seen nothing on those issues from the last three years.” The independent refuses to say who she would support in the event of a hung parliament, only that supporting the Coalition is a “possible outcome” if it improves its climate policies, and she will decide based on who has a “credible” offering. Voters seem to credit her family’s Liberal pedigree. “I’m sure she’s got strong Liberal values – I don’t think that will worry people,” Andrew says. Others are attracted because she represents change. Edward Brannan, who lives at City Beach, a little further up the coast from Cottesloe, says he feels despair at the two-party system: “It’s just not getting things done – it’s not addressing the issues, and I can’t see that changing.” Brannan, who subscribes to Climate 200’s communications, says he is voting on climate, accountability in government and women’s rights. “It’s appalling to have a federal government which is not accountable for its actions, and there’s nobody like Icac overseeing it. “That’s been avoided for the whole parliamentary session. What they put forward was rubbish.” Although some frustrated progressive voters are glad to have an alternative, many here are rusted-on Liberals. Kate Bailey, who stops to speak in the street near the upmarket fashion shops of the Claremont Quarter, describes herself as a “pretty solid voter” – not a swinging one. She thinks Scott Morrison is “fantastic”. “[Morrison takes] quite a level-headed approach to the issues, particularly Covid. He doesn’t seem to be one of the name-calling politicians that you see, particularly going on on the other side of the fence.” “I think he’s done a pretty good job managing the country over the last two or three years.” Many are still undecided. Jane and Laura, from Claremont, are weighing the choice. Jane leans Liberal, describing Hammond as a good politician, who “works very hard” and is “underestimated”. “I feel sorry for Scott Morrison in one way, because it’s been a terrible time,” she says, although she concedes the prime minister has been “MIA [missing in action] more often than he should”. But Laura – despite agreeing that Hammond did a good job connecting small businesses to federal support – is considering the alternative. “I’d like to see more on the global warming and climate side of things,” she says. “I think there is a lot of silence there – I don’t feel comfortable with that at the moment. Laura feels Morrison has “missed the ball on so many major crises over the last three years” and is disappointed in his leadership – although she is “not really a fan of Anthony Albanese either”. Despite differing views about Morrison’s performance, many voters in Curtin are looking for the same things in terms of policy – the question is how to get it.

4/15/2022,"I have been bullied, laughed at and been at the receiving end of various (probably unconscious) biases that resulted in me having to change jobs multiple times. I consider myself fortunate that every job change has proven to be the right step upwards in my career, but I can’t reconcile myself with the facts that those perpetrators are carrying on and thriving as if nothing has happened. I regularly wake up at 3am with a pounding chest as all that trauma comes back to me, and feel sheer anger and helplessness against what seems to be a real injustice. Eleanor says: Once when I was in a lather about the fact that Very Bad People can move through the world more or less unpunished, someone who was trying to be helpful said, “you know, the best revenge is to live your own life well”. I said, “No, the best revenge would be they go to jail.” I’ve come to think we’d both said something true. They were right that indefinite anger does not by itself do anything to correct the moral score. Anger that goes unexpressed, anger that isn’t harnessed, anger that wakes up without warning somewhere behind the sternum – can curdle inside the wrong person so the victim of an unfairness just ends up getting hurt twice. But I was right that the scales of justice can hang tilted for far too long. Sometimes the reason we hunger for punishment or recrimination isn’t just bloodthirstiness or a wish to strike back, adder-like, at something that threatened us. It’s a way of demanding the acknowledgment that the original insult denied. Of course, it would be preferable if they had an epiphany all on their own and agreed we deserve acknowledgment. But if we can’t have that, at least getting them to face consequences for their actions forces them to experience what they should have known all along: that what they did wasn’t OK, that we matter, and so does what they did. It seems to me that the task for moving past this injustice is to chart a way between these two truths: to find something that sates the desire to feel acknowledged without consuming you and keeping you awake. I don’t know the details of what these people said or did to you, nor how egregiously it violated anti-discrimination laws and policies where you live. I don’t know whether you have access to any formal remedies, or whether it would pragmatically be worth pursuing them. But the fact that this took place in a workplace adds indignity, and I wonder whether righting that indignity could help make this feel closed. You could use your skills and professionalism – the very things these people impugned – to make a formal list of what happened, when, and with whom, in as clinical a way as possible. You could leave that paper trail with a friend or former colleague, or even HR at a former company (though treat this one with caution, and know what processes will be triggered if you do). This may give you somewhere to put the intrusive memories when they appear, in a way that feels like harnessing them, rather than letting them harness you. You don’t need to send it to anyone implicated, and even if you do, don’t hold your breath for an apology. Ransoming our happiness to a wrongdoer’s reaction is a sure way to be disappointed. If you find that these feelings don’t pass with time, professional therapy can be a wonderful tool for acknowledging past trauma while keeping it in the past. But perhaps using your professionalism and equanimity to create your own record of what happened here could mean your own anger is not the only witness.

4/15/2022,"The nation’s largest home care provider says its aged care workers are at “breaking point” and are only receiving a fraction of the Coalition’s promised $800 bonus due to flaws with the scheme’s design. The vast and systemic problems facing aged care were exposed during the pandemic, including in home care, where workers have faced increased demand for services, huge staff turnover, abuse from families, and continuing low rates of pay. Both Labor and the Coalition have promised to better fund aged care, including a pledge from the Coalition to fund 80,000 new home care places and pay aged care workers $800 as a workforce bonus, designed in part to retain workers in the sector. But the chief executive of myHomecare Group, Stuart Miller, said turnover in the sector remained “nothing short of abysmal” and that the bonuses had meant “not a thing” in terms of staff retention. The group’s staff turnover was roughly 30% in the past year, better than the industry average but still extremely challenging to cope with, Miller said. “The outcome for us is that we are having to constantly manage which clients get the level of care that they need,” he said. “We make sure those people who have urgent needs always get met, but sometimes it means your house might not get cleaned this week, it might have to wait until next week, and that’s a really unfortunate thing for everybody.” Miller said home care workers had largely been forgotten in the current election campaign, despite working on the frontline of the pandemic in roles of extreme stress. He said the last two years had taken a huge toll on the sector, and called on the government to establish a new dedicated mental health support service for aged care workers. Without it, the company fears mass resignations across the sector. One of the company’s Sydney-based case managers, Megan Mainwaring, said the compounding pressures of the pandemic had led to increased stress and abuse of her care workers. More clients were staying at home and avoiding family contact due to the pandemic, putting more demand on home care workers to provide services. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We just don’t have the staff and when we do have good staff, they move on to bigger and better things, because the pay is so low,” she said. “And it’s hard work – emotionally, not physically. And when you can go to Aldi and work as a checkout operator and earn $10 an hour more, it’s quite deflating.” Aged care minister Richard Colbeck says the government has released 30,000 of the 80,000 home care places it promised last year. The funding is being progressively released until 2023. “We are releasing new packages at the rate of about 770 per week to continue to reduce the waiting list – and at a rate that supports a workforce that has grown by 15,000 since the start of November and continues to increase,” a spokesperson said. Mainwaring said she struggled to understand how 80,000 packages could be created, given the workforce challenges. “When I get a notification to sign up another client, which is great, but I just go ‘where are we going to get workers?’,” she said. “We just don’t have enough.” Ian Yates, head of the Council on the Ageing, said the delivery of the 80,000 packages was on schedule. He said workforce pressures were, however, significant, and the ability to actually deliver the packages was “patchy” across different regions. “High priority people across all four levels of package are generally getting their package within a month,” he told the Guardian. “But that’s high priority people, the rest it’s still some months and it varies from level to level.” Miller said many of his workers were only receiving a fraction of the promised $800 bonus, because it was only available for work conducted in one stream of federally funded home care packages. Most of his workers worked across multiple funding streams, including for aged care clients funded by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and state governments. “All of our workers work across multiple streams so actually very few got the full $800,” he said. He said the sector was staffed largely by part-time workers, but the government had used a pro-rata system to calculate the bonus payment. That meant many workers received even less of the $800. Colbeck’s office said the government also acknowledged the “pressures on the aged care workforce” and its impact on mental health, and pointed to the government’s funding of $7.1m to help ensure access to Beyond Blue.",News/Australia news,"Home aged care staff at ‘breaking point’, as most miss out on Coalition’s $800 bonus",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/home-aged-care-staff-at-breaking-point-as-most-miss-out-on-coalitions-800-bonus

4/15/2022,"The Morrison government is facing criticism for excluding flood victims outside Lismore from a new $350-a-week “top-up” paid to those unable to work. The disaster recovery allowance is paid at the jobseeker rate of $642.70 a fortnight to those who are temporarily unable to earn an income. The benefit is separate from the disaster recovery payment, which has been the subject of controversy after the Morrison government initially provided an extra $2,000 to flood victims in the National party-held areas Lismore, Richmond Valley and Clarence Valley but excluded nearby areas held by Labor. That decision was later reversed after other areas were assessed, with the government arguing Lismore had been initially prioritised as it was worst hit by the disaster. But last Friday the government quietly added a $350-a-week top-up payment to the disaster recovery allowance. The top-up is now automatically added to the payments of disaster recovery allowance recipients who work or live in the Lismore local government area. In a repeat of the situation that sparked fury last month, flood victims receiving disaster recovery allowance in other areas, such as those in the Labor-held seat of Richmond, are ineligible. Because the top-up payment can be paid for a maximum of 13 weeks, those in Lismore could theoretically receive a total of $4,550 more than victims from other areas. The federal National MP for Page, Kevin Hogan, had last week called for the disaster payments to be doubled. But the decision to introduce the “top-up” payment was not publicised by the federal government. The only official announcement was an update on the Services Australia website. Hogan has since labelled the decision to only include Lismore as “absurd”, while NSW state Liberal MP Catherine Cusack said the latest announcement showed a “total lack of integrity in the commonwealth’s funding approach”. Cusack, who intends to quit parliament over what she believes was the politicisation of NSW floods funding by the Morrison government, told Guardian Australia: “The whole northern rivers community would unite around the idea that funding should be according to need and not determined by where people live.” Last month, after fierce criticism from Cusack, Labor and others, the federal government added Ballina, Byron and Tweed to a list of areas eligible for an extra $2,000 in payments. Those areas are in the federal electorate of Richmond, held by Labor’s Justine Elliot. Elliot, who has accused the government of “pork-barrelling”, said the decision to once again exclude her constituents was “appalling”. “What makes it even worse is they snuck it out a Friday afternoon, they didn’t do a press conference,” Elliot told Guardian Australia. “I first heard about it when I saw it on the Services Australia website. They were doing it really quietly.” “There are people here who desperately need the top-up. Of course Lismore desperately needs that, and we feel for them, but we’re just as worthy,” she said. A joint press release issued on Tuesday by the federal and NSW government that outlined new flood support made no mention of the “top-up” payment. “It seems unfair it’s there for Lismore and not for us,” Elliot said. “I think the fact they’re trying to hide it shows they know that. These people have been through so much. Everyone in my community is really traumatised. People have lost their homes, their ability to work, because the business was flooded.” Mandy Nolan, who is running for the Greens in Richmond, said many people in the electorate “were unable to access their properties by car or couldn’t leave their property because “it’s impossible”. “These people have missed out on the support they need,” she said. “I’ve been into some of these areas. They have to hike on a road by foot two hours on rope into their properties. They’re the people who have really missed out. This recovery top-up would be so helpful.” Like Elliot, Nolan also believed the decision was politically motivated. “To cut out areas because they’re not a safe National seat, which Lismore is, [is wrong].” Because it is only the Lismore local government area that is eligible for the “top-up”, it is likely some of Hogan’s own constituents have also missed out on the extra support this time. “This funding has been targeted using a one-in-500 year flood definition,” Hogan told Guardian Australia. “The bureaucrats in Canberra (Australian Climate Service, National Recovery and Resilience Agency, and Bureau of Meteorology), somehow decided the one-in-500 year event only happened in Lismore. “This is obviously absurd. I have told the minister the one-in-500 year definition needs to be expanded to other communities.” A National Recovery and Resilience Agency spokesperson said the government had made additional support available to those who live or work in Lismore “as it was the most significantly affected local government area based on the proportion of people and businesses directly impacted”. He said the top-up payment had been paid to 2,037 people, of the 16,485 people eligible for the disaster allowance in the 58 flood-affected local government areas in New South Wales. The emergency management and national recovery and resilience minister, Bridget McKenzie, referred questions to the National Recovery and Resilience Agency.",News/Australia news,Coalition faces criticism for limiting ‘top-up’ payment to Lismore flood victims only,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/coalition-faces-criticism-for-limiting-top-up-payment-to-lismore-flood-victims-only
4/15/2022,"On the face of it, another month of Australia’s unemployment remaining around the 4% mark should be cause for celebration. Since the Australian Bureau of Statistics began releasing labour force figures in 1978, it has never released a figure as low as March’s official estimate of 3.95% (or, in its full, geeky glory, of 3.9542384%). The last time it was this low was in November 1974. Most researchers predict it will fall further, such as the ANZ’s 3.3% forecast by the end of 2022, or the Reserve Bank’s central forecast – reiterated just over a week ago – for the jobless rate to fall to below 4% this year and to remain there next year too. Most other jobless measures continue to head lower as well. The so-called underutilisation rate – which combines the unemployment and underemployment rates – fell another 0.3 percentage points to 10.3% last month. At the nadir of the first Covid wave, this gauge was 14.1% and on Thursday’s numbers, we haven’t been this low since just before the global financial crisis erupted in September 2008 during Kevin Rudd’s Labor government. Taking a wider view, though, the results – while pleasing – are neither particularly exceptional nor complete, despite upbeat commentary from the government. #BREAKING: The unemployment rate remains at 4%, a 48-yr equal low.With 17,900 jobs created in March, all full-time jobs, female unemployment fell to 3.7% - the lowest since 1974.The youth unemployment rate fell & is now at its lowest in 14 years. pic.twitter.com/8kreqF6LU1 As the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted earlier this week, jobless rates have in fact been sinking in many countries. For the G7 rich nations the February jobless rate averaged 4.2%, while in neighbouring New Zealand it was just 3.2% at the end of 2021. The test for how well low jobless figures will go down with voters may come with what the University of Melbourne labour economist John De New dubs the “last piece of the puzzle”: wages. The RBA noted that despite jobless rates diving, wage growth remains “only around the relatively low rates prevailing before the pandemic”. Any pickup “is still expected to be only gradual”, the central bank said, while admitting it remains uncertain how salaries will respond to historically low levels of unemployment. In February, the ABS reported the wage price index had risen 2.3% in 2021, well shy of the 3.5% increase in consumer prices. The next wages update will land on 18 May, just three days before voters go to the polls. De New says there’s been a longstanding “disconnect between returns to capital and returns to labour”, where companies have scooped up most of the spoils of improved profitability rather than sharing them with staff, even as jobless levels have kept dropping. “It’s shocking how flat wages have been and how a lot of the benefits of the last 10 years have gone to the stock market,” he says. “I don’t think that’s sustainable, and it’s obviously one of the driving forces of income inequality in this country.” His team’s work with the CBA to track people’s wellbeing found payments like jobkeeper and jobseeker played important roles in keeping people either linked to employers during the worst of the Covid disruptions, or ensuring minimum income support. De New expects the background issues of job insecurity – revealed during the pandemic by people forced to turn up for work ill rather than stay at home without an income – will again move to the forefront as people fill vacancies, but not in jobs they particularly want. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Some people obviously are having a harder time finding an appropriate job,” he said, adding that the decline of traditionally more stable work in areas such as manufacturing is only likely to continue. The National Skills Commission echoed De New’s views, forecasting out to the end of 2026 a long-term structural shift in employment towards services industries. Healthcare and social assistance, for instance, is expected to grow by 301,000 jobs or 15.8%, while professional, scientific and technical services will add 206,600 jobs or 16.8%. The two other big growth areas are likely to be education and training, and accommodation and food services. Michele O’Neil, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the notion low unemployment would lead to wage growth was “based on a 1980s understanding of the labour force, when the vast majority of jobs were secure”. “The headline unemployment rate hides the reality that millions of Australians are in insecure work, working multiple jobs or struggling to find the hours that they need to support themselves and their families,” O’Neil said. “More workers than ever before are having to work two, three or four jobs just to get by.” Cassandra Goldie, the president of the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), said 760,000 people remain as long-term unemployed or on jobseeker. Half of them were 45 years of age or older, and a third of them have a disability. While the economy has added almost 400,000 jobs since the low point of the pandemic in March 2020, the number of entry-level jobs was actually about 150,000 fewer than pre-pandemic levels, she said. “While there are more vacancies, that’s really due to staff turnover, short-term employment opportunities [and] the casualisation of those jobs,” Goldie said. “We’ve had double the number of people who are working four jobs or more since about 2014.” Jobseeker payments had now dropped to $46 a day from $80, with neither the Coalition and Labor planning to review the policy post-election. “There were very precious dollars for people who needed them,” Goldie said, adding Acoss had won backing from a range of businesses and other groups, including independent candidates, that the payments should be lifted to at least $70. “The most important thing we can do to support jobs and the lifting of incomes is to lift up the incomes of people in the bottom 40% of the community,” she said. “That’s the engine room of the economy – not relying on trickle-down economics like big tax cuts for people on higher incomes.”",News/Australia news,Are Australia’s unemployment figures cause for celebration or is the devil in the detail?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/are-australias-unemployment-figures-cause-for-celebration-or-is-the-devil-in-the-detail
4/15/2022,"As of this week, Queenslanders no longer have to prove they are double vaccinated to gain entry to entertainment and cultural venues, which are back at 100% capacity a month after mask requirements eased. And in South Australia, mask restrictions are lifting on Friday. But more than an estimated 700,000 Australians are, at any given time, considered immunocompromised – through genetic causes, as organ recipients, undergoing treatments for cancer and some infections and simply age. Many in these groups are choosing to remain in self-imposed lockdown as Covid-19 precautions in public settings ease. Sydney-based musician Liz Martin, who has a lifelong auto-immune condition, understands why so many Australians are raring to go out and want things to get back to normal. “But we are still in a pandemic, and it would be great if we could keep a lot of these simple measures in place to help ensure the safety, health and wellbeing of people that are more vulnerable,” she said. “Many people with a disability aren’t attending events. It’s really impacting a lot of people who have to stay at home, they’re still in lockdown to look after their own health. They feel abandoned.” A recent survey of more than 8,000 Australians who had attended cultural events pre-Covid found that 59% felt they were now ready to go back “whenever permitted”. Among those classified as at risk of a serious health outcome from contracting Covid-19 and those with a disability, the percentages fell to 39% and 43% respectively. The study, released last month by culture and community sector researchers Patternmakers, also found that while almost 80% of respondents were satisfied with the safety measures event organisers had in place, one in 10 expressed concern that not enough was being done. Most states are continuing to enforce mandatory mask-wearing rules in high risk settings such as hospitals, aged care facilities, airports and public transport. But when it comes to entertainment, each state differs. In NSW, mask wearing and proof of vaccination is no longer required, though it is encouraged, at entertainment venues like cinemas, museums and live music venues. Masks remain compulsory at indoor music festivals with more than 1,000 attending, as do proof of vaccination certificates, however. In Victoria, proof of vaccination and checking in is still mandatory at entertainment venues. Mask wearing is not enforced, but “strongly recommended”, at crowded venues. “I don’t think people were sticking to the mask-wearing rules like they used to anyway,” said Melbourne musician Eliza Hull, who lives with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a group of neurological disorders. “I noticed it as soon as it stopped being compulsory to wear masks in retail stores, that was when people stopped wearing them at live events and hospitality venues. I think a lot of people feel like they’ve done their part, and now they’re over it. “But I feel like masks are the one thing that we can do as a community to protect the most vulnerable communities. And it’s really hard for people with a disability to see people without masks on, it’s such a small price to pay to protect people with disabilities and people whose [health] is compromised.” The lack of uniformity in Victoria’s Covid-safe laws are a source of some irritation to the chief executive of Palace Cinemas, Benjamin Zeccola, who told the Guardian while his staff of more than 500 workers across 24 cinemas continue to wear masks for entire shifts, workers at events such as AFL games and the Australian Grand Prix were permitted to work maskless. “The strictest check-in requirements and vaccination enforcement requirements are in place in Victoria, under threat of ruinous fines, which is putting a strain on business and staff because it is expensive to monitor and monitoring causes conflict with customers, who rightly believe they shouldn’t have to check in any more … Victorians seem to have had enough, remonstrating with powerless customer service staff,” Zeccola said. In Western Australia, seated entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and stadiums remain capped at 75% capacity. Masks remain mandatory everywhere indoors, other than in the home, and proof of vaccination is still required to gain entry to most cultural and entertainment venues. Earlier this week, Silent Witness actor Liz Carr called for separate performances for vulnerable people, who still want fellow audience members to wear masks or socially distance. “Theatre should remain accessible even to those of us who have health conditions,” she said, speaking backstage at London’s Royal Albert Hall on Sunday after winning best supporting actress at the Olivier Awards. “If I’d had a five-minute speech, I would’ve talked about how I haven’t been to the theatre in over two years. This is a frightening night for me.” Carr, who lives with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and has used a wheelchair since childhood, said she felt safe on stage but would not feel comfortable in the audience. “I was on stage with everybody who was testing, everybody in the cast tested every day, so I felt safer than being a random member of the public in an audience around people I didn’t know,” she said. Matthew Hall, the chief executive of Arts Access Australia, said Carr’s idea of mask-only performances could be a valuable addition to the mix. He said he was surprised to see few masks being worn at recent Adelaide Fringe events he attended, and said it seemed bizarre that holding a drink while watching a performance excused an patron from donning their mask. “It’s an option, but it shouldn’t really be needed, if people just were sensible about wearing their masks, understanding that their behaviour is putting other people at risk,” he said. Martin said maintaining streamed performances, which many arts institutions introduced during lockdowns around the world, would also help make cultural events more accessible for those reluctant to risk Covid infection. “To see that stopping and people wanting to return to the way things were before and forgetting about all the things we’ve learned over the last couple of years, I find that very disappointing,” she said.",Arts/Culture,"‘People feel abandoned’: as masks come off, thousands of Australians feel scared to go out",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/14/people-feel-abandoned-as-masks-come-off-thousands-of-australians-feel-scared-to-go-out
4/15/2022,"More than 20 Ancient Greek artefacts that have never left the mediterranean country before will be displayed in Melbourne as part of an exhibition on the history of the civilisation’s legacy and its impact on modern culture. Melbourne Museum will exhibit 44 objects in total from the National Archeological Museum in Athens for its Open Horizons: Ancient Greek Journeys and Connections exhibition. The exhibit’s centrepiece is a 400-kilogram sculpture of the Greek god Zeus. A marble sphinx statue – excavated at Spata, in Attica, in the 19th century – is one of 23 artefacts that have never been displayed outside Greece before. Made during the Mature Archaic period, the statue is one of the earliest known Archaic Sphinxes. The pieces represent separate themes, guiding visitors through the ancient Greeks’ trading of ideas and goods and its influence on culture. The items date from the Early Bronze Age to the Roman period. Linda Sproul, director of exhibitions and experiences at Museums Victoria, said the exhibit told “a story of cultural exchange between and across peoples and communities”. “It’s actually looking at these objects afresh, to see what other stories these objects reveal in terms of how people lived with one another, and how they influenced one another,” she said. “This idea of people journeying and exchanging ideas and connections and trading together or having spiritual belief together, that didn’t stop 3,000 years ago. So the really wonderful thing about exhibitions like this is it allows you a chance to kind of step out of time, and to think about all of the time that humans have been around, and how there are connections across years, and centuries and millennia.” The state government secured Open Horizons following a trip by the premier, Dan Andrews, to Greece in 2017, which began the discussion with the previous government about improving cultural exchange between the two countries. The state government made a $2m investment in the exhibition in last year’s state budget. Oakleigh MP Steve Dimopoulos is one of five state parliamentarians with Greek heritage and he travelled with Andrews. He said the exhibit had a special significance for Victoria’s Greek diaspora, with the state home to the largest concentration of Greeks outside the country in the world. “Grandparents and parents can bring their children and grandchildren here to touch and feel the civilisation that they’ve so talked about and heard and been engrossed in. They don’t have to jump on a plane to Athens. They can see it right here in Carlton in Melbourne Museum,” he said. Kalliopi Tsakri, conservator of antiquities and works of art at the National Archaeological Museum, said all of the artefacts were transported using rubber-lined crates to ensure they were protected from road and aeroplane vibrations on their journey from Athens. Tsakri is part of the National Archaeological Museum’s team that travelled from Greece with the artefacts and has installed them in Melbourne.

4/15/2022,"Canada was warned in 2012 by its own scientists that a virus was infecting both farmed and wild salmon, but successive governments ignored the expert advice, saying for years that risks to salmon were low. Justin Trudeau’s government has said it will phase out open-pen industrial fish farms off the coast of British Columbia by 2025. But both his government and the previous Conservative government were in possession of a newly released report that linked large-scale farms and wild salmon to the highly contagious Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV). In 2012, biologists with the department of fisheries and oceans investigated the presence of the virus, which has been found in both farmed and wild salmon. In March, a federal information commissioner ordered the report be released, after a multi-year access-to-information battle between the group Wild First, which opposes open-pen salmon farms, and the federal government. Details of the report were made public on Thursday by the Globe and Mail. Kristi Miller-Saunders, a federal biologist and an author on the study, called the delay in releasing the report a “travesty” and said its omission has contributed to longstanding doubt over whether farmed salmon were infecting wild salmon. PRV causes anemia and jaundice in farmed salmon. But in wild Chinook, whose numbers have collapsed in recent years, the virus is associated with a different disease which causes blood cells to rupture, leading to kidney and liver damage. Miller-Saunders said in a statement her research was the first to discover the virus in North America and that the virus was “being actively transmitted between farmed and wild salmon in B.C.” A study last year from the University of British Columbia confirmed her work, concluding that the closer wild Chinook are to fish farms, the higher the likelihood they’ll be infected by the Piscine orthoreovirus. The decade-old findings take on a new urgency as both the federal government and officials in British Columbia grapple with a decimation of wild Pacific salmon stocks in the region, which experts fear could have far-reaching ecological consequences. In addition to PRV, biologists have also argued that sea lice and mouth rot, which can be fatal in salmon, is also being transferred from farmed to wild salmon. Alexandra Morton, an independent biologist who has studied Pacific salmon for the last thirty years, has long argued that open-pen farms are responsible for the presence of the illnesses plaguing wild salmon and alleges the country’s fisheries ministry too often sides with corporate interests. “There are scientists that genuinely care about investigating these issues. And there is the middle level of the department that is suppressing people like Dr Miller. They’re ignoring all of the outside research,” Morton told the Guardian last year amid frustration that critical research findings were being withheld. Trudeau’s government has pledged to phase out open-pen salmon farms by 2025 – a move fiercely opposed by operators. Industry has warned the closures will result in millions of farm salmon being prematurely killed as well as the loss of hundreds of jobs and are fighting the orders in court. “Industry should have known this was coming and seen the writing on the walls. They should have started transitioning to different kinds of enclosures. Instead, they relied for years on the government – on the department of fisheries and oceans – to hide their sins,” said Morton. The BC Salmon Farmers Association said in a statement it would rather see peer-reviewed information about industry rather than “ad-hoc” releases through Canada’s access to information laws.",News/Environment,Canada ignored warnings of virus infecting farmed and wild salmon,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/infected-farmed-wild-salmon-canada-virus-report
4/15/2022,"A wind-driven fire burning across New Mexico is believed to have killed two people, after the remains of a couple were found near their charred home. Police investigators and firefighters found the older couple’s remains on Wednesday afternoon after family members notified police that the two had tried to evacuate but were unaccounted for. The wildfire has prompted eviction orders for as many as 4,500 people, and destroyed more than 200 residences on the edge of a mountain community in the southern part of the state. Kerry Gladden, a spokesperson for the Ruidoso police, said that fire crews are hoping to take advantage of a break in the relentless winds to make headway against the deadly blaze. The couple’s remains were found near the house but not in it, and no additional information was immediately available, Gladden said. Authorities were working to confirm the identities of the two people. The fire moved into a more densely populated area on Ruidoso’s north-eastern side on Wednesday afternoon, prompting more evacuations. Laura Rabon, a spokesperson for the Lincoln national forest, interrupted a fire briefing and told people to get in their cars and leave after the flames jumped a road where crews were trying to hold the line. Overnight, crews kept the flames from pushing further into the village, Rabon said. The fire has torched about 9 sq miles (23 sq km) of forest and grass, and the strong winds that battered the area have left behind toppled trees and downed power lines. Crews continued to work on Thursday to restore power to parts of the village that have been without it since Monday. While the cause of the blaze was under investigation, fire officials and forecasters warned that persistent dry and windy conditions had prompted another day of red flag warnings for the eastern third of New Mexico and other parts of the southwest. Incident commander Dave Bales said the strategy was “attack while we can”, noting that winds were expected to pick up Thursday afternoon and again Friday. “We’re trying to keep this fire as small as possible, especially because it’s right in the community,” he said. “We’ve had a loss of a lot of structures so our crews are right there on the fire front going as direct as possible.” Six new large fires were reported Wednesday: three in Texas, two in Colorado and one in Oklahoma. In all, wildland firefighters and support personnel were trying to contain 11 large fires that have charred more than 40 square miles (103 square kilometers) in five states. The National Interagency Fire Center reported Thursday that since the start of the year, 18,550 wildfires have burned about 1,250 sq miles. That’s well above the 10-year average of 12,290 wildfires and 835 sq miles burned. Hotter and drier weather coupled with decades of fire suppression have contributed to an increase in the number of acres burned by wildfires, fire scientists say. The problem is exacerbated by a more than 20-year western megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. Elsewhere in New Mexico, wildfires were burning northwest of Ruidoso, along the Rio Grande south of Albuquerque, in mountains northwest of the community of Las Vegas and in grasslands along the Pecos River near the town of Roswell.",News/US news,Couple found dead near their home as fire sweeps through New Mexico village,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/14/new-mexico-wildfire-couple-dead
4/15/2022,"The eulogizing began as soon as the Kardashian-Jenner family announced the end of their flagship reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians (KUWTK), after 14 years in 2020. Or, more accurately, the memorializing – the attempts to take stock of the field-warping influence that America’s unofficial royal family had on the laws of celebrity, beauty, fashion and self-monetization in the 2010s. The original show was the Kardashians’ rocket to an unfathomable stratosphere of wealth, fame and influence, the vehicle through which a wealthy but strident Hollywood-adjacent clan once best known for their late father and a sex tape self-promoted and content-generated their way to the epitome of the social media celebrity order. By the time it ended in spring of last year, the family had seemingly outgrown the reality TV format they had basically created in their image. Why bother face-tuning six-month-old drama for TV when you can push the narrative immediately on your phone? Were there any rungs on the fame ladder left to climb? Apparently, yes. Of course the “for better or for worse” paeans to KUWTK’s end have become accessories to the start of something new: The Kardashians, the family’s new reality show on Hulu, born from a deal worth an estimated $100m. (The family now means: Kris, Kourtney, Kim and Khloé Kardashian, and Kendall and Kylie Jenner, as well as their numerous children and current or ex romantic partners. Rob Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner are not involved.) The latest cog in the Kardashian-Jenner mega-corporation is a sleeker, cannier version of the original rooted in the same propagandistic DNA though, in the only two 45-minute episodes made available to critics, said narrative spinning seems half-heartedly applied. It’s easy to consume the show but difficult to process The Kardashians. The new show is relatively trivial – Kourtney’s ex Scott Disick stressed about not getting invited to a barbecue, Kim stressed about hosting SNL last October, Khloé stressed about appearing on James Corden, I stressed about their Instagram faces and cyborg bodies in motion. But the family, especially Kim, is at this point something like a cultural hyperobject – an idea too big, suffusive and multifaceted to fully comprehend or describe. Since KUTWK premiered in 2007, the Kardashians have become the avatars and drivers of American culture on innumerable fronts, among them: impossible beauty standards, the aesthetic of an entire dominant platform (Instagram), the democratized accessibility of fame, image manipulation (how many times have they denied blatant photo-shopping and cosmetic alterations?), the unreality of reality TV, the relentless drive to turn everything into profit, the currency of undefeated shamelessness. The family – again, Kim especially – have made their name on their queasy proximity to and appropriation of blackness. As the White Negroes author Lauren Michele Jackson argued, Kim, an Armenian American, has a singular talent for metachrosis – the ability to change color. She occupies a “cherished place in the American racial imagination that, combined with wealth, prevents contact with the deathly effects (and melancholic affects) of brownness in this country while reaping the exoticism of not-quite whiteness”. All of this buoys and buffets the show, which in and of itself is as bland as their monochrome ath-leisure suits and glossy nude lips. The Kardashians, executive-produced by Ben Winston (who also EPs The Late Late Show with James Corden – note the episode 2 crossover), opens as if on a hang glider. The camera zooms around their colossal, vacuous homes in birth order, except for the conclusion: Kim, arguably the reason they ever got a reality show in the first place, the Kardashian with access to the highest echelons of celebrity, and not so subtly the new show’s lodestar. KUWTK was always an expression of shrewd, uncanny, often tasteless manufacturing, and it continues to be here. The storylines are already public knowledge, and filtered here for barely titillating, but not overly revealing, effect. Kourtney is in love with Travis Barker and trying for a fourth child. Kim is prepping for SNL and, she proudly notes, studying for the California “baby bar” exam. Khloé is still friends with Scott, who is still not over Kourtney, and still defending ex Tristan Thompson. Consummate mom-ager Kris keeps showing up to check on things. (Kendall and Kylie are almost entirely absent.) There are a lot of skintight bodysuits and large dark sunglasses. The show was never “good”, in a moral sense, nor was it seamless, but it’s always a very rich text. There are few things more representative of American capitalism and culture than an already rich family who hustled their proximity to fame into a self-generating content well of living advertisements. (I can’t keep track of the numerous brands and dubious businesses, but safe to say they’re in every scene of the new show.) The Kardashians are the proto-influencers, blurring the lines of personal and professional in the name of promotion and profit. The fakeness of the reality show – and it’s a shrug to note the on-screen conversations here are clearly nipped and tucked for television – has always been beside the point. Kardashian TV is more like improv – attuned and curated versions of themselves, from people so used to being on camera they muse about it repeatedly while on new cameras. The richest part of the new Hulu show is witnessing snippets of their now gravitational celebrity orbit, however mediated – the familiarity with which famous performers from James Corden to Amy Schumer enter and exit the screen. Schumer advises Kim on her SNL monologue with actual pushback to her jokes (one that is sharper than you’d expect). There’s something interesting, in a work-porn adjacent way, in watching Kim name-drop “Dave” (Chappelle) for monologue advice or request SNL booker (and Ben Affleck ex) Lindsey Shookus for last-minute line changes to spare the unstable Kanye. Interesting and somewhat revulsive, too, to see James Corden’s hype-man advise Khloé to ignore social media – this, for a woman who has gaslit followers on her manipulated body and images and participated in her own fair share of online bullying. These asides stick the most because they hint both at the celebrity ecosystems whose rupture the Kardashians rode and remade, and the casualness with which the ultra-famous go about their well-oiled days. Nothing has changed and yet everything is different now, elevated. The Kardashians have stuck together. Though the new show feels, in structure and six-month-old content, like a recent relic, no doubt people will be watching.

4/15/2022,"Asylum seekers flown to Rwanda by the British government will be put up in a no-frills hostel a mile away from Kigali city centre. People fleeing war and persecution will be taken to a guest house, built in 2014, which only has 50 rooms available, although there are plans to expand the facility. Hope guest house, a privately owned hostel in the Gasabo district of the capital, is currently being used for tourist accommodation, according to Rwandan government officials. However, it is understood that Rwandan authorities are in negotiation to lease the basic and stripped-back property to be used to house UK asylum seekers while their claims are being processed. However, given Britain’s growing asylum backlog, a hostel that can only accommodate 100 people – if there are two people to a room and guests share communal bathrooms – falls well short of what is required as part of the Home Office’s immigration strategy. There are just 12 toilets and five showers for about 100 people and small 12ft by 12ft (3.6 x 3.6-metre) bedrooms, with two beds in each. There are plans to expand the facility by building more accommodation blocks, eventually offering 150 rooms and able to sleep up to 300 people, but the government has not said how long this will take. Asylum seekers are expected to be given three meals a day to eat in a communal dining room, with some kitchen facilities also available for those with special dietary requirements. The plans, announced by Boris Johnson at a time when his premiership hangs by a thread after his Partygate fixed-penalty notice, have been criticised across the political spectrum. The Tory peer Lady Warsi wrote on Twitter on Thursday that they were “ineffective and costly”, adding: “It’s also inhumane and shames our proud history as advocates of human rights and the refugee convention. It’s inconsistent with our generous response to the Ukrainian crisis. Its timing is cynical and political.” Meanwhile, Priti Patel made a private visit to the site on Thursday to see an example of what accommodation may be on offer. It was understood to be the home secretary’s first visit to Rwanda since the deal was agreed, after being briefed by Home Office and Foreign Office officials who have been researching the plan. The PA Media news agency contributed to this report.",News/UK news,UK asylum seekers to be housed in no-frills hostel in Rwandan capital,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/uk-asylum-seekers-to-be-housed-in-no-frills-hostel-in-rwandan-capital
4/15/2022,"Boris Johnson’s plans to send unauthorised asylum seekers on a one-way ticket to Rwanda have been roundly condemned amid warnings that it will be challenged in the courts and could result in further deaths in the Channel. After the prime minister outlined plans to hand an initial down-payment of £120m to the Rwandan government in the hope that it will accept “tens of thousands” of people, politicians and refugee groups condemned the move as inhumane, unworkable and a waste of public money. The Rwanda proposal was one of a series of measures announced by the prime minister and Priti Patel, the home secretary, as they seek to get to grips with a febrile political row over Channel crossings. The number of people crossing has already passed 5,000 this year, more than double the 2021 total at the same point. Amid calls for the government to disclose the overall costs of the plans, which have not been released, it emerged that:  Men and women could be flown 4,500 miles to Rwanda, where they will be encouraged to apply for refugee status. However, children and their parents would not be sent.  The Royal Navy has been given powers to control the Channel after another day of hundreds of people arriving in small boats to seek refuge in the UK.  Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee, accused Johnson of unveiling the plans as part of a “massive distraction” from becoming the first prime minister to be found guilty of a criminal charge while in office.  A Border Force union official has warned that the announcement will result in a short-term spike in refugees trying to cross the Channel, with an elevated risk of travelling in poor conditions, putting lives at risk.  A snap poll by YouGov of almost 3,000 voters on Thursday found that only 35% of people support the measures, with 43% opposed. Speaking at a press conference in Kent, Johnson said the scheme was needed to “save countless lives” from human trafficking by breaking the business model of people smugglers. “The deal we have done [with Rwanda] is uncapped, and Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead. And let’s be clear, Rwanda is one of the safest countries in the world, globally recognised for its record of welcoming and integrating migrants,” he said. Asked about the poor human rights record in Rwanda, where some groups have logged the torture of detainees, he said: “Rwanda has totally transformed. Over the last few decades it has totally transformed from what it was.” Refusing to engage with questions about his breaking of lockdown rules, Johnson said the Royal Navy would from Thursday take over “operational command” in the Channel from the Border Force to ensure “no boat makes it to the UK undetected”. Measures will be introduced to intercept more small boats and the navy will be given “primacy” to track and intercept them – with £50m of new funding to pay for Wildcat helicopters, search and rescue aircraft, and drones. Under the plans, those sent to Rwanda will be offered asylum there, with claims processed within three months. Those who are successful will be able to stay for at least five years with a training and support package. As Johnson addressed reporters, new arrivals reached the shore in Dover on what officials acknowledged was a busy day for crossings. In a visit to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, Patel was shown pristine accommodation that will be used to house people flown from the UK. The guest house has 50 rooms over four floors that can accommodate a maximum of 100 people. Two more blocks will be built that will provide a maximum capacity of 300. In a press conference with Rwanda’s foreign minister, Vincent Biruta, Patel said on Thursday: “Our world-leading migration and economic development partnership is a global first and will change the way we collectively tackle illegal migration through new, innovative and world-leading solutions.” However, the UN refugee agency has opposed the plans and said they could be challenged under the Refugee Convention. “[The UN High Commissioner for Refugees] remains firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer refugees and asylum seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards. Such arrangements simply shift asylum responsibilities, evade international obligations, and are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention,” said UNHCR’s assistant high commissioner for Protection, Gillian Triggs. “People fleeing war, conflict and persecution deserve compassion and empathy. They should not be traded like commodities and transferred abroad for processing.” The Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi called the scheme inhumane and cynical. “This proposal of offshoring asylum seekers to Rwanda is ineffective and costly,” she said. “It’s also inhumane and shames our proud history as advocates of human rights and the refugee convention. She said the plan was inconsistent with the UK’s “generous response” to the Ukraine crisis and described the timing of it as cynical and political. The British Red Cross executive director, Zoe Abrams, said the humanitarian network was “profoundly concerned” about the plans to “send traumatised people halfway round the world to Rwanda”. “We are not convinced this drastic measure will deter desperate people from attempting to cross the Channel either. People come here for reasons we can all understand, like wanting to be reunited with loved ones, or because they speak the language. Making it harsher may do little to stop them risking their lives,” she said. Lucy Moreton, the professional officer of the ISU immigration and border union, warned that the announcement could lead to further loss of life in the Channel as people become desperate to reach the UK before any plans to send them Rwanda are implemented. She said: “What has been announced today is likely to push the immediate numbers up. And that will mean people crossing in less than ideal conditions, putting lives at risk. “We are worried that they will simply panic and hurt themselves, or inadvertently hurt us, or deliberately hurt us to stay in the UK to be prosecuted rather than be sent to Rwanda. This is not going to happen quickly, possibly for months, and you are frightening everybody until then.” The president of the Law Society of England and Wales, I. Stephanie Boyce, said there were serious questions over whether the plans complied with international law. “The government is announcing this scheme before parliament has approved the necessary powers,” she said. “There are serious questions about whether these plans would or could comply with the UK’s promises under international treaty.”",News/UK news,"UK Rwanda plan for asylum seekers decried as inhumane, expensive and deadly",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/uk-rwanda-plan-for-asylum-seekers-decried-as-inhumane-deadly-and-expensive
4/15/2022,"As Brendan Rodgers put it, Leicester City’s 1,600 supporters were up in the clouds, housed high in a caged corner of this arena, but in some ways they had the best vantage point to watch their team reach a first European semi-final after recording a stunning comeback victory. The travelling fans had spent the afternoon mingling with the club’s top brass, the chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha among those taking in the atmosphere in Markt Eindhoven, one of the city’s main squares, and, once they shake off the hangovers from the after-party, they will begin to plot another adventure, with José Mourinho’s Roma waiting in the last four of the Europa Conference League. James Maddison’s equaliser fuelled Leicester’s belief and Ricardo Pereira prodded in at the back post after the substitute Patson Daka, who earlier spurned a golden chance to level, was denied. Maddison had displayed a determination to deliver, his appetite clear when he wriggled between Érick Gutiérrez and André Ramalho to carve an early opening and he sourced Leicester a lifeline on which to build after they fell behind to Eran Zahavi’s first-half strike, whose finish into the far pocket of Kasper Schmeichel’s goal from an awkward angle, via Jonny Evans, was akin to a snooker pot. A PSV supporter launched his beer towards Maddison as the midfielder was mobbed by his teammates and then Pereira sealed victory with two minutes to spare. It was a no-frills finish at the end of a well-worked move, the impressive Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall releasing Ademola Lookman, who picked out Daka inside the box. José Mourinho's Roma await Leicester in the semi-finals after the Italians smashed Bodø/Glimt 4-0.Nicolo Zaniolò (pictured) hit a hat-trick to seal a 5-2 aggregate success, and gain revenge for two painful defeats in Norway this season.

PA Media PSV would have taken the lead earlier had Schmeichel not got a strong right hand to a thunderous Mario Götze volley, but for so long it seemed the gnawing thing for Leicester would be their failure to take their chances. Harvey Barnes ignored an unmarked Maddison to his right and placed a shot wide before PSV punished a Youri Tielemans lapse on 27 minutes and Daka fired wide after racing through one on one with the goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo midway through the second half. For the first, Kelechi Iheanacho played a superb reverse pass from inside his own half to free Barnes but the winger, seemingly blinkered, went it alone. Rodgers dragged his fingers down his face and Maddison was equally unimpressed. Daka’s miss after latching on to another fine Iheanacho pass was even more agonising. Zahavi’s goal stirred the home crowd, who offered PSV a rousing reception despite defeat at full-time, but Leicester continued to create chances, with Maddison twice going close. His deflected shot was hooked off the line by Jordan Teze and he flashed over from inside the box after cutting inside Gutiérrez approaching the interval after Timothy Castagne, meeting Tielemans’ scooped cross, headed wide at the back post The break provided a chance for a rallying call. “For us it was a case of ‘there are no second chances,’” Schmeichel said. “You don’t get another chance. At least if you’re going to go out, go out fighting and give it everything. We are a young club when it comes to European football and we were up against what you would probably call a juggernaut of European football. To come away from home, make it difficult [for ourselves], and then still dig in and get the result in the end is a sign of a top mentality.” Rodgers said he maps out possible scripts in his mind before a game and this one ultimately provided a beautiful late twist. After the final whistle, he punched the air and his players went over to rejoice with their supporters, who banged on the plastic barriers in front of them. Srivaddhanaprabha, alongside his brother and vice-chairman, cut an equally delighted figure. “It is always great to see [the chairman, Khun] Top,” said the Leicester manager, whose side return to Premier League action at Newcastle on Sunday. “He is an amazing owner for us.” Leicester were aided by the half-time arrivals of Lookman and Daka but it was Maddison who continued to dictate the pace. Another substitute, Ayoze Pérez, starred, and it was from his clever run and cutback at the byline that Maddison swept in to level 13 minutes from time. Pérez went close to scoring from a Lookman cross, flicking at goal to force a sprawling save from Mvogo, but five minutes later Pereira applied the finishing touch. “We keep making history and there is always a new chapter to be written,” Schmeichel said. “We’ve always said with the mentality we have: ‘Why not us?’ We have a big belief in our ability, in the direction the club is going.”",Sport/Football,Leicester book historic semi-final spot as late fightback floors PSV Eindhoven,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/psv-eindhoven-leicester-europa-conference-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report
4/15/2022,"My mum, Anne Dale, who has died aged 58 of motor neurone disease, was a consultant paediatrician who dedicated her career to the children of the north-east of England and their carers. Anne was born in Salford, Greater Manchester, into a family like no other. Her parents, Pat (Patricia, nee Knight), a homemaker, and George Dale, who worked for the charity Community Transport in Salford, had 12 children through birth and adoption. In addition, they fostered dozens more, both short-term and long-term, and all were treated as their own. In this way, Anne had more than 60 brothers and sisters. She grew up in a home full of love with never a dull moment. It gave her an immense capacity for kindness. Anne attended Cathedral high school in Salford, then went to sixth form at De La Salle College, where she met Terry Aspray in a production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Iolanthe. They married in 1987. Anne studied medicine at Leeds Medical School, qualifying in 1987, and trained in paediatrics at hospitals in and around Newcastle. After they both qualified as doctors, she and Terry went to the Gambia, where from 1991 to 1993 she was the first woman to head the Medical Research Council’s Dunn human nutrition unit. As well as running the field station with more than 100 staff, she completed a research project on helicobacter pylori infection in Gambian children, part of her doctoral thesis for Newcastle University, which she completed in 2001. From 1994 onwards, she worked at the Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle, and Newcastle General hospital and Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead, becoming a consultant paediatrician at the last of these in 2001. She was known for her fantastic medical knowledge and her endless kindness. Anne was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2020. She continued to be as active as she could for as long as possible, leaving work in summer 2021. Outside her work, Anne loved music and was dedicated to worthwhile causes. After leaving her job she continued to be an active campaigner online – including for Extinction Rebellion and No to Hassockfield. She was a trustee for the Children’s Foundation and was the driving force behind its baby box initiative, to give every child born in the north-east the essentials for a good to start in life. She also supported Medical Aid for Palestinians, Médecins Sans Frontières and Freedom from Torture. Her energy for doing good was limitless and her bonds with her family were close, especially with her mother, Pat, who survived her by a month, but also with her in-laws.

4/15/2022,"My grandma Pat Dale, who has died aged 89, was a loving mother to more than 60 children and served her community, locally and beyond. She was born Patricia Knight in Salford, Greater Manchester, the third of four children of Winifred (nee Kelly), a full-time mother who did voluntary work for the British Legion, and Joe Knight, who had a variety of jobs and in later years was a driving instructor. After leaving St Gilbert’s elementary school in Eccles at the age of 14, she had various jobs, including at WH Smith and Turners Asbestos, and in 1951 married a fellow leader in the local scout group, George Dale, who was a plant-hire manager in Manchester. Pat and George had 12 children through birth and adoption, and provided a loving home for dozens more through fostering. All the children were on an equal footing. They remember Lake District holidays, catering boxes of Creme Eggs, and a dinner table that somehow magically accommodated however many needed feeding. She kept in touch with her whole family – via phone calls, letters and birthday cards, and, most importantly, the open-door policy at her home, which was regularly utilised. Pat was a valued member of St Matthew’s RC church in Eccles, putting her faith into action through good works, running bring-and-buy fundraisers. She continued to lead Guides and Scouts. One of her favourite sayings was: “A Girl Guide has courage and is cheerful in all difficulties.” It worked for her, too. Pat enjoyed opportunities to travel, visiting her eldest brother in the US, seeing her children working abroad, from Kenya to Mauritius, and trips to Rome, Israel and Palestine. Closer to home, she made friends wherever she went, using train journeys to knit and invite conversation. She once wrote to Nigel Farage, informing him in no uncertain terms that the country has lots of space for all who need refuge. Pat had time for everyone and there was always plenty of soup and apple crumble to go round. She never thought highly of herself for all the good she did, instead seeing it as a privilege to be a part of others’ lives. George died in 2013.

4/15/2022,"When Boris Johnson’s position was at its most precarious two months ago, he had to convince Conservative MPs sticking by his side was worth it. A plan was devised – dubbed “Operation Red Meat” – to give those losing faith in his administration some belief that there was a higher purpose than just defending their leader through scandal after scandal. The prime minister knew he needed to shore up support, prove himself a proper conservative and enact more of the policies that saw him clinch an 80-seat majority at the last election. A major theme of the Tories’ campaign in 2019 was Brexit – and in the years since, Johnson has been mindful that the message about “taking back control of our borders” was particularly potent for some. Senior advisers have been keen to ensure the voters who swung from Labour to the Conservatives – often via Ukip and the Brexit party – end up sticking with Johnson at the next election. As such, it was with much fanfare that Johnson wanted to announce a tough new immigration policy designed at deterring people from making the perilous journey across the Channel from France via “irregular” routes. But while it came as welcome news to many Tory MPs, there are still concerns about the detail: the cost and the choice of Rwanda as the country where some asylum seekers will be sent. Just last month, Conservative peer Lord Kirkhope warned that “the costs of offshoring would be exorbitant”, citing “conservative estimates” of about £2m a person a year. So far, just £120m has been committed by the UK government to fund the scheme. Despite repeated promises from home secretary Priti Patel to bring the numbers of arrivals down, they remain at their highest on record: 4,600 people have arrived on small boats on the Kent coast this year, with about 600 in a single day earlier this week – and “hundreds” more on Thursday. The failure to get the numbers down came up in one-to-ones Johnson held with wobbling MPs when he was in his famed “listening mode” at the end of January. His ear was bent repeatedly about the issue, not only by people who thought the government should take stronger action to end the arrival of migrants on small boats, but also those who believed it was a helpful subject to be dominating the political agenda. The Conservatives have risked being outflanked on traditional turf, such as law and order, but know that the subject of border controls allows them to more easily exploit the old divisions of the Brexit years – and try to paint Labour as soft on immigration. While one Conservative MP, Andrew Mitchell, has expressed concern about the plan, many more in the party were celebrating that they could finally appear to be tackling irregular migration. “We’ve been waiting ages for action like this,” a “red wall” Tory MP supportive of the policy admitted. Government insiders said they had been hoping to announce it months ago, to try moving attention away from the original Partygate scandal. And Johnson was said to have pushed hard for it to be announced before the local elections, when many Conservatives worry they will be thumped over the fines and ongoing police probe into law-breaking parties in Downing Street. Rwanda’s human rights record has also prompted concern – given the UK does take in refugees who say they are fleeing the threat of persecution in the very same country. Finally, there is the issue of whether the tough talk will translate into a dramatic reduction in the number of people crossing the Channel, or simply draw attention to an issue the government has so far appeared unable to solve. The government’s own refugee minister, Richard Harrington, hinted at this last week, admitting: “I’m having difficulty enough getting them from Ukraine to our country, there’s no possibility of sending them to Rwanda.” Some Tory insiders fear this is just another sticking plaster solution – and that over-promising and under-delivering will be more damaging for the party in the longer term.",News/UK news,What are the Tories trying to achieve by offshoring asylum seekers?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/what-are-the-tories-trying-to-achieve-by-offshoring-asylum-seekers
4/15/2022,"International agencies saw their influence wane after the 2008 financial crash as the support for multilateral agreements gave way to quick-fix solutions between governments. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which hold their joint spring meetings next week, have suffered like many others. So when the IMF boss, Kristalina Georgieva, wags a finger at the major central banks – the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the People’s Bank of China, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England – the question is: are any of them listening? After a flirtation with austerity in 2009 and 2010, IMF officials largely rejected cuts in government spending as a route to growth but it was a message that went unheeded in most major capitals. The Washington-based organisation has produced reams of literature arguing that inequality is bad economics and that climate change is an emergency, only to be met by loud applause and little in the way of action. Georgieva said on Thursday in a scene-setting speech that inflation “is a threat to financial stability and a tax on ordinary people struggling to make ends meet”. She subscribes to the orthodox view that central banks should take “decisive action”, which is a euphemism for jacking up interest rates. She also warned them to be careful about the spillover effects and urged governments to mitigate the impact on those countries that have to borrow to survive. While developed countries are suffering from spiralling inflation and higher interest rates, the biggest threat is to emerging and developing economies that not only face “the added risk of higher borrowing costs but also the risk of capital outflows”. But is anyone taking notice? Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka head a long list of countries that have already found it impossible to finance their debts. Many of them owe money to foreign investors that buy distressed government debt via institutions such as BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager. There could be deals next week brokered by the IMF, the World Bank and ministers sitting on the G20 board to alleviate current debt payments, but the outcome will probably mean existing loans provided by western governments, or the IMF and World Bank themselves, are rescheduled over a longer time period. No one is expecting a confrontation with private lenders. Such small steps are not enough. These countries should have a proportion of their debts written off. And not just by public bodies, but by all lenders, which must be forced to concede, much as high street banks are forced to do, that when a borrowers’ circumstances have changed, sometimes long after the original loans were made, repayments on whatever basis will prevent a sustainable recovery. Residential property rents are soaring in the UK and so are property values: two trends that have been increasing the costs of bringing up a family ever since the 2008 financial crash. Whether you buy a house or rent, the cost has been increasing for some time. Ultra-low mortgages have encouraged the trend, enticing young people to take on larger home loans stretched over 30 years or more. Taking a global view, a decade-long property boom has doubled the value of the real estate market to reach $350tn (£270tn), four times the size of the $90tn global economy. More than 80% of global investment is in property. Dhaval Joshi, the chief European strategist of BCA Research, describes that incredible wealth stored in the housing market as “eyewatering”. It’s not just Brits. Everyone is betting on the same thing. During this unprecedented boom, investors have extracted massive gains. Rents on average are up 40% globally over the last 10 years. Can it keep going? Will young people keep working to pay the ever increasing rent/mortgage bills? All eyes are on the central banks and whether they keep raising interest rates. If they do, that may tip the balance. It’s not clear why Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter. He says it would be a better company if it were privately owned by him. It is not making the best of the opportunities open to it, he said, adding in a letter to the board that the company is “the platform for free speech around the world” but cannot achieve this “societal imperative” in its current form and “needs to be transformed as a private company”. One thing is for sure, he has put Twitter in play as a takeover target. Mark Cuban, the maverick US financier, says some of the big tech companies that are swimming in cash – Google, Amazon, Facebook - will consider a buyout. At at a cost north of $43bn, that looks unlikely.",News/Business,IMF wags its finger at central banks – but are they listening? | Phillip Inman,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/imf-wags-its-finger-at-central-banks-but-are-they-listening
4/15/2022,"Moscow has said it will be forced to strengthen its defences in the Baltic if Finland and Sweden join Nato, including by deploying nuclear weapons, as the war in Ukraine entered its seventh week and the country braced for a major attack in the east. However, the Lithuanian defence minister, Arvydas Anušauskas, claimed on Thursday that Russia already had nuclear weapons stored in its Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad, which borders Lithuania and Poland. That claim has not been independently verified, but the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) reported in 2018 that nuclear weapon storage bunkers in Kaliningrad had been upgraded. The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev, a senior member of Russia’s security council, said on Thursday that all its forces in the region would be bolstered if the two Nordic countries joined the US-led alliance. Medvedev’s threat is the latest of many instances of nuclear sabre-rattling from the Kremlin aimed at deterring western military intervention on behalf of Ukraine. “We’re obviously very concerned,” said the CIA director, William Burns. “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” But Burns added: “While we’ve seen some rhetorical posturing on the part of the Kremlin, moving to higher nuclear alert levels, so far we haven’t seen a lot of practical evidence of the kind of deployments or military dispositions that we would reinforce that concern.” Finland and Sweden are deliberating over whether to abandon decades of military non-alignment and join Nato, with the two Nordic countries’ leaders saying Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine has changed Europe’s “whole security landscape”. Their accession to the alliance would more than double Russia’s land border with Nato members, Medvedev said. “Naturally, we will have to reinforce these borders” by bolstering ground, air and naval defences in the region, he said. Medvedev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, explicitly raised the nuclear threat, saying Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would mean there could be “no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic – the balance must be restored”. Russia had “not taken such measures and was not going to”, he said. “But if our hand is forced, well … take note it wasn’t us who proposed this.” Russia borders the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia, and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said Moscow would take the security and defence measures that it would deem necessary if Sweden and Finland join Nato, adding that the move would seriously worsen the military situation and lead to “the most undesirable consequences”. Anušauskas described the Russian threat as “rather strange” because, he said, nuclear weapons “have always been kept” in Kaliningrad. “They keep nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles, and have warehouses,” he told the Baltic News Service. “The international community and countries in the region are perfectly aware of that.” In 2018 the FAS analysed satellite images and concluded that the Russians had carried out a major renovation of what appeared to be “an active nuclear weapons storage site in the Kaliningrad region”. However, the analysts were unable to determine whether nuclear warheads were already being stored there, were imminently about to arrive, or would be moved there in a crisis. “There is indeed a storage site in Kaliningrad, known as Kolosovka. That is where nuclear weapons for all units located in Kaliningrad would be,” said Pavel Podvig, a military expert based in Geneva who runs a research project on Russian nuclear forces. “There are conflicting reports about whether Russia actually has any weapons in Kolosovka. We don’t really know.” Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at FAS, said work was still going on at the storage bunkers. “They’re working on security perimeter now. So I doubt there are warheads in there,” Kristensen said. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday that Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, was likely to decide on a Nato application “within weeks”, while her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said there was “no point delaying” the decision. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russian forces who have pulled back from northern Ukraine after failing to take the capital were “increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats”. The deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, said on Thursday that Russia was massing forces along the Russia-Ukraine border, in Belarus and in the breakaway Transdniestria region of Moldova, with the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia coming under missile attack. Moldova accused the Russian army of trying to recruit its citizens after British military intelligence said Moscow was attempting to enlist fighters in Transdniestria, a narrow strip of land held by pro-Russia separatists that is within about 25 miles of the Ukrainian port of Odesa. “Such actions do not promote peace for all of us, our fellow citizens, for our families. Such things are very dangerous and they must be stopped,” said the Moldovan foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, without giving further details. The Kremlin did not immediately comment. The chief military development of the day was the loss of Russia’s flagship missile cruiser, Moskva, which sank in “stormy seas” while being towed to a port in the Black Sea after an explosion. The Ukrainian southern military command claimed late on Wednesday to have struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, while distracting its crew with an aerial drone, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew to abandon ship. Russia’s defence ministry initially denied reports that it had sunk and claimed the fires had been extinguished. Four Russian ships that had gone to the Moskva’s rescue were being hampered by stormy weather and by ammunition blowing up onboard, it said. But late on Thursday, the ministry said in a statement: “The cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship’s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank.” The crew had been safely evacuated, but it marks the most significant military loss of a naval vessel since the Argentinian cruiser the General Belgrano was torpedoed by a British submarine in 1982. Moscow said the port of Mariupol was under its full control, but Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Thursday that the battle over the seaport was “still ongoing today”. Mariupol is a key target in Moscow’s push to secure a land corridor between the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas and Crimea, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014, and its capture would allow the Kremlin’s military planners to redeploy vital resources farther east. Russian officials accused Ukraine of using helicopters to bomb a town in the southern Bryansk region, about 6 miles from the border, saying seven people were injured in shelling and describing the attack as a “deliberate strike on residential buildings”. The claim could not be independently verified. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Hague-based international criminal court, which deals with rights abuses, said Ukraine had become a “crime scene”. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said on a visit to Bucha, where officials say more than 400 civilians died: “We’re here because we have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed.” Moscow has rejected all reports of atrocities, which Putin has dismissed as “fakes”.",News/World news,Russia warns of nuclear weapons in Baltic if Sweden and Finland join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/russia-says-it-will-reinforce-borders-if-sweden-and-finland-join-nato
