2/22/2022,"Kyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois teen who was acquitted last year in the shooting deaths of two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight Monday where he announced plans to sue individuals and media companies for negative coverage of him. Rittenhouse had traveled to Kenosha with an assault-style rifle and subsequently shot and killed two protesters. Despite his acquittal, some maintain the opinion that Rittenhouse is a murderer. He called out The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg and Cenk Uyger of The Young Turks by name, but was otherwise vague about who his potential targets might be “Right now we’re looking at quite a few,” Rittenhouse said. “Politicians, celebrities, athletes. Whoopi Goldberg’s on the list. She called me a murderer after I was acquitted by a jury of my peers. She went on to still say that. And there’s others. Don’t forget about Cenk from The Young Turks. He called me a murderer before verdict and continues to call me a murderer.” Some have accused Rittenhouse of being a white supremacist. While out on bail, prosecutors said he flashed a white power sign while at a bar with members of the far-right Proud Boys. Rittenhouse also said he plans to sue anyone who made the assertion that he’s a white supremacist. “We are gonna hold everybody who’s lied about me accountable,” Rittenhouse said. “Such as…everybody’s who’s lied, called me a white supremacist. They’re all gonna be held accountable and we’re gonna handle them in a courtroom.” Rittenhouse and his team have launched The Media Accountability Project to fundraise, and purportedly take media companies and individuals to court. Tucker Carlson Tonight airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on Fox News Channel. Watch a popular conservative radio host tell Fox News the 'media has made too much' of the Hillary Clinton 'scandal': On Special Report With Bret Baier Thursday, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt played the proverbial wet blanket for all who believe recent filings by Special Counsel John Durham will mean bad news for Hillary Clinton. Since a recent filing by Durham, most of which centers around Michael Sussman, a lawyer associated with Clinton’s campaign, many in conservative media have excitedly pointed the finger at Clinton, accusing her of things that aren’t even in Durham’s report. Fox News and other outlets have spent countless hours on the subject, but Hewitt says people are making too much of it.
“I agree that the media has made too much of this filing. I think I said two nights ago, we don’t know anything yet because Sussman can either go John Dean or he can go Gordon Liddy,” Hewitt said, referencing Watergate. He continued, “But I noted that John Durham said there will be motions in limine coming. And Harold (Ford Jr.) and I did go to Michigan Law School and we both know one thing from our time there, from great law professors, nobody knows nothing about what the prosecution has until the prosecution rolls out its indictment.”
Conservative lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, who was a staunch defender of former President Trump, appeared on Newsmax about a half hour earlier, and said very much the same. Dershowitz said he hasn’t seen anything yet that points the finger at Clinton, and that the indictments so far only add up to process crimes instead of substantive indictments.

2/22/2022,"When the recent COVID-19 wave fueled by the omicron variant hit the U.S., no one expected it would lead to the number of deaths it did. As of Wednesday, the nation is reporting 2,200 new COVID daily deaths on average. While this is lower than the 3,400-peak seen last winter, it's still three times higher than the number of average fatalities recorded two months ago. MORE: COVID hospitalizations and deaths surge in Los Angeles County Additionally, last winter, vaccines had only just started to roll out, children were not yet eligible and the conversation surrounding boosters was far off. With around 60% of Americans fully vaccinated during the most recent wave, daily deaths from omicron are still relatively high, which begs the question: Who is dying of COVID-19 when there is such strong vaccination coverage? Infectious disease doctors say it is still mainly unvaccinated people, most of whom are in their 30s and 40s with no underlying health issues, who are dying. ""The vast majority of patients — anywhere from 75% and greater — we're seeing is primarily unvaccinated individuals who are getting COVID and wind up in the hospital severely ill and are currently dying,"" Dr. Mahdee Sobhanie, an assistant professor of internal medicine and an infectious diseases physician at The Ohio State University, told ABC News. A small percentage of deaths are among fully vaccinated (and boosted) people who are either older or have preexisting conditions that increase their risk of dying. Video: Omicron and unvaccinated young people Unvaccinated still make up majority of deaths Nearly two years into the pandemic, unvaccinated Americans are still making up the majority of COVID deaths. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that during the first week of December — when the omicron variant began taking hold — unvaccinated people were dying at a rate of 9 per 100,000. By comparison, fully vaccinated people were dying at a rate of 0.4 per 100,000, meaning unvaccinated people were 20 times more likely to die of the virus, according to an ABC News analysis. State-level data, from California to Mississippi, shows similar results. ""We started [in 2020] with the most vulnerable deaths among the elderly,"" Dr. David Zonies, associate chief medical officer for critical care services at Oregon Health & Science University, told ABC News. ""As we transitioned into different variants, the age demographic shifted. Now we see very young people dying. It's around 30-year-olds and 40-year-olds."" One of those people was father-of-two Christian Cabrera, a 40-year-old comedian from Los Angeles with no underlying conditions. ""He's always brought joy and laughter to everybody,"" his brother, Jino Cabrera Carnwath, told ABC News. ""He would be the type of person that would bust out into song in a quiet elevator."" However, he was unvaccinated. Christian feared potential side effects and, because he didn't get sick often, he didn't think he needed the vaccine, his brother said. MORE: Amid scarce supplies, some unvaccinated patients prioritized for COVID treatments But, right after the Christmas holidays, he started to develop symptoms. After attempting to treat himself at home, his oxygen levels began dropping dangerously low. Christian was taken to Sherman Oaks Hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU and where he remained until he passed away on Jan. 21. Jino, who has set up a GoFundMe for Christian's 3-year-old son Noel, said two days before his brother died, he received a text message from Christian in his hospital bed saying he regretted not getting vaccinated. ""He sent me a text saying, 'I can't breathe. I wish I had gotten vaccinated. I really regret it. If I could do it all over again, I would do it in a heartbeat to save my life,'"" Jino said. ""I think that was his message too to everybody: if you're on the fence, please get all the protection you can, get your vaccine, get your booster."" Dr. Taison Bell, a critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia, told ABC News many of his unvaccinated patients had similar feelings and regretted their decisions. When he asked why they weren't vaccinated, they would mostly answer, ""I just thought I didn't need to get vaccinated."" ""And there are sighs of regret in how they say it,"" Bell said. ""These are preventable deaths now, by and large. The people that we have in the ICU could have avoided hospitals altogether if they were vaccinated."" Fully vaccinated people with preexisting conditions also dying While most U.S. COVID deaths are made up of unvaccinated people, there is a small percentage of fully vaccinated Americans who are getting breakthrough infections and dying. Doctors say the overwhelming majority of these cases are among people with underlying conditions, many of whom are on immunosuppressive medications. ""Also, patients who have other medical conditions: obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, HIV,"" Sohbanie said. ""So, if you have other medical conditions that can also put you at high risk, those are the [fully vaccinated] patients that can wind up getting hospitalized and dying of COVID."" Jeff Sales, a 47-year-old Army veteran and nurse, from Sarasota, Florida, was one of those patients. He enlisted in the Army at age 18 with the goal of being a medic and served two tours in South Korea, according to his son, Brayden Sales, 22. During one of those tours, Jeff came down with rheumatic fever, which went untreated for several weeks. This led to a hole in his heart and, at age 22, he had a metal heart valve installed. After being medically discharged from the Army, he got his nursing degree and was a nurse for more than 15 years, mostly in Utah before the family moved to Florida in August 2020. ""Everything in his life was about helping people and making special connections and doing everything he could for everybody and anybody,"" Brayden told ABC News. Although Jeff worked as an orthopedic nurse, his unit had been converted into a COVID unit to deal with the influx of patients. He took several precautions including always wearing a mask and getting fully vaccinated and boosted. MORE: Nearly 1,500 NYC municipal workers fired for not being vaccinated against COVID However, on the night of Jan. 20, another nurse told him he was looking pale. Then, he developed chills. He was admitted into the ER and at 6:00 a.m. the next day, his COVID test results came back positive. Brayden said a few hours later, his father was struggling to breathe, and his condition rapidly declined. Individuals with heart valves have an increased risk of blood clotting compared to the general population, and one of the side effects of COVID is an additional increased clotting risk. ""When his blood thickened up, it caused his heart valve to fail and, when his heart valve failed, he went into complete organ failure,"" Brayden said. ""If it wasn't for his heart valve, it wouldn't have hit him as hard, and he probably would still be here."" On Jan. 21, just 12 hours after testing positive, Jeff died. Dr. Scott Curry, an assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at Medical University of South Carolina, called the deaths of fully vaccinated people the ""most heartbreaking"" to him. He said, in Charleston, as of Feb. 10, COVID-19 deaths have comprised about 50% severely immunosuppressed, vaccinated patients and 50% unvaccinated patients of all ages MORE: Nearly 1,500 NYC municipal workers fired for not being vaccinated against COVID ""When you're a healthy adult who chose not to get vaccinated, you rolled the dice and took your chance,"" Curry told ABC News. ""But when you're immunocompromised, and you live with someone who won't get vaccinated or you're exposed to someone, those are the ones who will die when they get COVID. They are the ones at the greatest risk."" Brayden said he hopes his dad's death encourages others to do what they can to limit the effects of COVID. ""He always was an advocate of doing something to prevent the spread,"" Brayden said. ""If he could get one person to just think about what they're doing and change something to make it so this virus doesn't spread as much, he would be happy.""

2/22/2022,"The U.S. has obtained intelligence that Russian officers have received orders to launch an invasion into Ukraine. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin confirmed the information during an appearance on Face the Nation Sunday. The intelligence suggests that Russian commanders are making military preparations and “doing everything that American commanders would do once they got the order to proceed,” Martin said. Earlier Sunday, both the State department and Pentagon said the U.S. was still pulling all the diplomatic stops to attempt to de-escalate the Russia-Ukraine crisis as an incursion becomes increasingly probable. Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Russian president Vladimir Putin’s positioning of forces in Ukraine’s immediate geographical neighborhood indicted an impending incursion. “He’s followed the script almost to the letter,” he said. During a presentation before the United Nations Security Council Thursday, Blinken noted that the U.S. had expected Russia to manufacture a crisis that could serve as an pretext for intervention. Russia just extended drills with its approximately 30,000 troops in Belarus past Sunday, when joint military exercises were scheduled to end. On Sunday, the Belarusian defense minister cited growing tensions in eastern Ukraine as the reason “to continue the inspection of reaction forces.” As recently as last week, Russia had not planned to prolong its military presence in Belarus. “As we described it, everything leading up to the actual invasion appears to be taking place: all these false flag operations, all of these provocations to create justifications,” he said. Blinken said that the U.S. would try to negotiate with Russia up until the last minute, however. “We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” he added. “We will do everything we can to try to prevent it before it happens, but equally we’re prepared, if he does follow through, to impose massive consequences, to provide for Ukraine’s ongoing defense and to bolster NATO,” Blinken said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Sunday the U.S. was running a “full-court press” to deter Putin, exhausting all negotiation avenues to convince him to change his mind. Responding to questions about why the U.S. has not imposed pre-emptive sanctions on Russia, Kirby noted that such action if used prematurely could provoke what they are trying to prevent. “If you punish somebody for something they haven’t done yet, then they might as well just go ahead and do it,” he said. On Friday, President Joe Biden told reporters he was confident Putin had made his decision and that invasion was imminent in the “coming days.” Vice President Kamala Harris backed up this belief Sunday.

2/22/2022,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, placed under sanctions by China when he left office at the end of the Trump presidency last year, will visit Taiwan next week and meet President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's government said on Monday. Taiwan's foreign ministry said Pompeo and his wife would visit the Chinese-claimed island from March 2-5, and also meet Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and give a speech at a think-tank. ""Former Secretary of State Pompeo is a long-term and staunch friend of Taiwan and made outstanding contributions to promoting Taiwan-U.S. relations during his time in office,"" the ministry said in a statement. His visit shows the bipartisan ""rock solid"" U.S. support for Taiwan and the close Taiwan-U.S. friendship, it added. The Donald Trump administration gave strong backing to Taiwan, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, including high profile arms sales and visits of top U.S. officials to Taipei. China put sanctions on ""lying and cheating"" Pompeo and 27 other top Trump-era officials as President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin noted that Pompeo had been sanctioned by China due to his ""anti-China actions"". Taiwan will only ""get burned"" in its attempts to solicit support from the United States for its independence, he told reporters. China has stepped up its military and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan over the past two years seeking to force the island to accept its sovereignty. Taiwan's government says it wants peace but will defend itself if attacked, and that only the island's people have the right to decide their future. Separately, Wang also announced sanctions on U.S. companies Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Technologies Corp over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, at least the third time it has announced punishments against the firms.

2/22/2022,"By Andrew Osborn and Mark Trevelyan MOSCOW (Reuters) - Seated at a large white table in an echoing Kremlin hall, Vladimir Putin summoned his top security officials one by one on Monday to give him their advice at a potential turning point in the crisis around Ukraine. In a lengthy meeting of his Security Council, broadcast on state television in what a presenter called ""unprecedented footage"", Putin cross-examined ministers and spy chiefs on the question of whether to recognise the two breakaway Donbass regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states. One after another, they walked to a white lectern in the column-lined hall to paint a relentlessly grim picture of the situation in Donbass. Looking pale and tired, Putin drummed with his fingers from time to time as he listened. His special representative on Ukraine, Dmitry Kozak, said Kyiv and the West had no interest in implementing a 2015 peace deal to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for the past eight years. The head of the FSB security service, Alexander Bortnikov, told Putin the security situation in the two breakaway regions was deteriorating, and that nearly 70,000 people had so far fled to Russia. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine of stepping up shelling of the separatist regions - which Kyiv has strongly denied - and said some residents had been left without gas or water. Much was riding on the president's decision. Recognition of the separatist regions could provide Russia with a pretext to openly send its military forces into the Donbass and justify that by arguing that it was protecting residents there from Ukraine. It would also effectively kill off the Minsk peace agreements that all sides, including Russia, have until now called the only possible route out of the crisis. But Putin was taking his time. SHOW OF AUTHORITY At one point he intervened to emphasise that he had not discussed in advance what the officials were going to tell him, as if to dispel the impression that the proceedings had been choreographed. In reality, the televised meeting appeared calculated to convey the impression of a leader carefully arriving at an important decision after weighing all the evidence from his subordinates. It also gave Putin the chance to demonstrate his authority over the most powerful people in the land, putting them in their place if they slipped up. He jumped in to chastise foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin when the latter said he ""will support"" recognition of the Donbass regions. ""Will support, or do support? Tell me straight, Sergei Yevgenievich,"" Putin said. When Naryshkin then said he supported the breakaway regions becoming part of Russia, Putin upbraided him again: ""We're not talking about that... We're talking about whether to recognise their independence or not."" Naryshkin: ""Yes, I support the proposal to recognise their independence."" Putin: ""Ok, please sit down, thank you."" With all the reports delivered, all eyes turned to Putin to pronounce his verdict - but he was not yet ready to end the suspense. ""A decision will be taken today,"" he said - and with that, the cameras stopped rolling.
