4/25/2022,"The Northern Ireland elections for the Stormont assembly could see a historic shift in the balance of power locally. With less than a fortnight to go before the election on 5 May Sinn Féin is in pole position to overtake the DUP and become the largest single party in the devolved government. If the projections are realised at the ballot box it would mean Sinn Féin’s Northern Ireland leader, Michelle O’Neill, would become first minister. That would mean a party that is avowedly republican with past links to the IRA; that favours a united Ireland; and that retains a policy of absenteeism in relation to its MPs in Westminster; and leads the government in one of the four countries of the UK. The latest of a series of LucidTalk tracker polls for the Belfast Telegraph put Sinn Féin at 26% of the vote (up one point) followed by the Democratic Unionist party at 19% (up two points), followed by the centrist Alliance party at 16%. The unionist vote is splitting three ways – with the DUP followed by the Ulster Unionist party at 13% and the Traditional Unionist Voice, which offers a more radical antiprotocol policy than the DUP, at 9%. The SDLP were flat at 11%. Other parties including the Greens and People Before Profit and independents and others came in at 2% of the vote each. Another survey by the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool suggests the emergence of a younger secular unionism – people from both Protestant and Catholic traditions fed up with the identity politics but supporting the union with the UK. Although this is a narrative being run by some unionist parties to scare voters into supporting them at the polls, the reality is a referendum pitting the status quo against a united Ireland is a very serious move and is not on the horizon. Peter Shirlow, professor at Liverpool University’s Institute for Irish studies, says that while many unionists fear a united Ireland, a win for Sinn Féin will be a “wake-up call” for unionism for a different reason. He said his research over the past decade showed the growth of a “secular unionism” people within the Protestant and Catholic heritages who want to stay in the UK but who will not use their vote “just to keep the other side out”. “It might be a unionist electoral crisis, but not a constitutional crisis. It will be the death throes of Protestant unionism, a rejection, not of the constitutional position but people saying ‘enough’, we support the union, but we won’t vote for homophobes, we won’t vote for misogynists, we won’t vote for this never-ending crisis politics. “It doesn’t seem that people are seeing this as a big opportunity for nationalism either. Sinn Féin is Sinn Féin but parties like the SDLP are flat as a pancake,” he says. One thing parties have got to get away from, and particularly unionist, “is the misnomer that rights are concessions” to the other side, he said. His tracker panel found that two-thirds of nationalists believed that if “devolved politics worked better people would focus less on the constitutional question” of whether Northern Ireland was part of the UK or Ireland. It could also prompt the collapse of the assembly entirely. Under the power-sharing system, the biggest and second biggest party getthe first and deputy first minister positions respectively – and one minister cannot be in position without the other. The DUP has repeatedly refused to say if it would accept the role of deputy first minister if pushed into second place amid fears it could be accused of “propping up” a Sinn Féin government. Although the first minister and deputy first minister are equal in power, words matter in Northern Ireland. Attempts to eliminate any connotations of hierarchy by making the posts joint first minister failed in Westminster last year. If the DUP were the second largest party after the election but refused to take their position as deputy prime minister, the executive could not function.",News/UK news,Northern Ireland: what could historic election win for Sinn Féin mean?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/northern-ireland-what-could-historic-election-win-for-sinn-fein-mean
4/25/2022,"The co-leader of Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) has urged the former chancellor Gerhard Schröder to hand in his party membership after he made clear in an interview that he had no intention to resign from his seats on the boards of Russian energy companies over the war in Ukraine. Schröder, who was Germany’s head of government from 1998 to 2005, presides over the board of the Russian oil company Rosneft and is chairman of the shareholder committee of pipeline company Nord Stream. Stepping down from these posts “would have been necessary to rescue his reputation as a former and formerly successful chancellor”, Saskia Esken told the German public broadcaster Deutschlandradio on Monday morning. “Sadly he hasn’t followed that advice”. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, the SPD leadership had sent Schröder a letter asking him to relinquish his roles at the Russian state-owned companies, which has reportedly gone unanswered. Asked whether the ex-chancellor should hand in his membership of the centre-left party of the German leader, Olaf Scholz, Esken said: “That he should.” In an interview with the New York Times published over the weekend, the 78-year-old statesman-turned-lobbyist sounded stubbornly unrepentant over the links between German industry and Russian energy providers, which was broadly continued by his successor, Angela Merkel, but has limited the ability of Europe’s largest economy to meet Putin’s military aggression with economic sanctions. “I don’t do mea culpa,” Schröder told the US broadsheet from his office in Hanover, in north-western Germany. “It’s not my thing.” The Social Democrat suggested he would resign from his board seats only if Russia chose to turn off gas deliveries to Germany, something he claimed “won’t happen”. While describing the war in Ukraine as “a mistake”, Schröder appeared to defend his close friendship with Russia’s president. “The image that people have of Putin is only half the truth”, he said. “Gerhard Schröder has acted for several years as a businessman and we should stop perceiving him as an elder statesman, an ex-chancellor”, said Esken, a leftwinger who has risen to co-leader of the SPD from fringes of the party largely unconnected to Schröder’s old network. “He earns his money through work for Russian state companies and his defence of Vladimir Putin against the allegation of war crimes is downright absurd”. The SPD’s traditional belief in a Wandel durch Handel (change through trade) policy of rapprochement towards Russia has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, even after chancellor Scholz heralded an “epochal turn” in Germany’s postwar approach to military spending. Some members of the Green party and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) that make up Scholz’s coalition government have openly accused the leader of stalling on heavy weapons deliveries to Ukraine in order to appease his party’s old guard. The three parties are under pressure to smoothen over their differences at a coalition committee meeting on Tuesday, especially as the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is threatening to submit a motion on weapons exports that could expose further cracks in their power-sharing alliance.

4/25/2022,"Emma Hayes praised the resilience of her Chelsea team after they came from behind to earn three points against Tottenham despite having a player sent off at 1-1. Asked whether that was the difference between Chelsea and their title rivals Arsenal, who have wilted when under pressure at times this season, Hayes said: “I can only talk about our resilience because I think that it’s unfair [to compare].” Hayes was being diplomatic but the resolve and problem-solving capabilities of her players have been a critical component in turning games when things have not been going their way. Arsenal’s squad may be littered with stars of competing footballing quality, but finding answers when the hardest questions are asked, mid-game, is Chelsea’s forte. SW Match report: Tottenham 1-3 Chelsea Sign up for our free women’s newsletter! Arsenal, to be fair, played as if they were the league leaders and Chelsea the chasers in an ice-cold 3-0 triumph over Everton. The first of the three goals came in the 43rd minute via Caitlin Foord, who controlled a magnificent cross-field pass from Leah Williamson before sliding past Sandy MacIver. Beth Mead and Jordan Nobbs then joined in the scoring on the other side of half-time, netting their 50th WSL goals within eight minutes of each other. There was very little response from Everton. They were up against an Arsenal defence with 11 clean sheets in 18 WSL games under Jonas Eidevall and a 12th never looked in doubt. Arsenal’s win, after Chelsea’s defeat of Tottenham, means one point separates two head-strong teams with three games left. MN JORDAN NOBBS JOINS THE 5️⃣0️⃣ CLUB!She joins Arsenal team-mate Beth Mead in registering her 50th #WSL goal this evening 👏 pic.twitter.com/vab658Sn0F The Manchester City midfielder Julie Blakstad got her first goal for the club in their 4-0 win over Leicester on Sunday. The Norway international, who signed in January, scored on her fifth league appearance – and what a stunning goal it was. The ball was fed to Lauren Hemp, who made a great break and passed to Blakstad, who converted with a beautiful one-touch finish. “Yeah absolutely [it was a good feeling to see it go in],” the 20-year-old said. “It is always fun to score goals. I think it was a good performance even though we wanted to score some more goals. But we had a good win, that’s the most important thing.” She became the 45th goalscorer in City Women’s history. SR You are likely to be in a relegation fight when you have to rely on one of your centre-backs – Louise Quinn in this case – to score two late goals to secure only a second league win of the season. The Birmingham City captain has had her fair share of resolute performances this season, having played every minute of every game, and she was the hero against Brighton in Saturday’s 3-1 win. Quinn’s first goal came via a header after Veatriki Sarri’s mesmerising cross from the left. Her second, with just two minutes remaining, snuffed out any hopes of a Brighton comeback. Bottom-placed Birmingham are still a long way from safety with Chelsea up next on Sunday, while Brighton surely need to win their remaining two games, and rely on other results going their way, if they are to obtain a top-six finish. MN A BIG win for Birmingham 🙌Which was your favourite goal? 💬 pic.twitter.com/Pyn7vWflEF It was a fairytale match for the defender Kate Longhurst as West Ham defeated Reading 2-1 on her 100th appearance for the club. Longhurst played her first game for the Hammers in 2018 and has often spoken about how much the club means to her as a lifelong supporter. Her contributions have not gone unnoticed, with the manager, Olli Harder, saying before the match: “Kate has been and continues to be a fantastic servant to women’s football. She’s been a joy to work with since I arrived at the club and it’s a massive moment for her to achieve this for the club that she adores.” SR “I couldn’t be more proud of my players,” a delighted Aston Villa manager, Carla Ward, said after the 0-0 draw against Manchester United. She added: “I wanted a togetherness where they would run through brick walls for each other – and they did that.” United dominated the game, and should have won but Villa have now conceded only four goals in their past seven WSL games. That is a huge improvement from the 18 goals in the previous six league games. They are secure in ninth place and will look to add more attacking verve to their new-found defensive sturdiness in the remaining games of the season.

4/25/2022,"Forensic doctors carrying out postmortem examinations on bodies in mass graves north of Kyiv say they have found evidence some women were raped before being killed by Russian forces. “We already have a few cases which suggest that these women had been raped before being shot to death,” said Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who with a team of coroners has carried out dozens of autopsies on residents from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka who died during Russia’s month-long occupation of the area. “We can’t give more details as my colleagues are still collecting the data and we still have hundreds of bodies to examine,” he said. Pirovskyi’s team has been examining about 15 bodies a day, many of them mutilated. “There are many burned bodies, and heavily disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify,” he said. “The face could be smashed into pieces, you can’t put it back together, sometimes there’s no head at all.” He said the bodies of some women they had examined showed signs that the victims had been killed by automatic gunfire, with upwards of six bullet holes in their backs. Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region, said details of alleged rapes had been forwarded to his office, which is investigating circumstances such as locations and the ages of victims. “Rape cases are a very delicate and sensitive matter,” Tkalenko said. “Forensic doctors have a specific task of checking the genitalia of female victims and looking for signs of rape.” A foreign coroner working north of Kyiv who asked to remain anonymous said some bodies “are in such bad shape that it is not easy to find signs of rapes and sexual abuses. But we are collecting evidence in a few cases of women we believe had been raped before being murdered.” Following the withdrawal of Russian troops from towns and suburbs around the capital, dozens of women have told police, the media and human rights organisations about atrocities they say they suffered suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers. Investigators have heard testimony of gang-rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint and rapes committed in front of children. Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, has officially documented the cases of 25 women who were kept in a basement and systematically raped in Bucha, a town north of Kyiv now synonymous with Russian war crimes. Authorities have warned those cases could be the tip of the iceberg and accused Russian troops of using rape as an instrument of war. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a statement last week that hundreds of women had been raped by Russian soldiers. Ukrainian authorities have declined to give exact figures or details about where the rapes occurred or the ages of the victims. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during the war even as evidence to the contrary has mounted. Tkalenko said women were reluctant to file police reports about acts of sexual violence because they believed the perpetrators would not be caught. Instead, they were contacting psychologists and doctors for help. “Psychologists work with the rape victims and then with detectives,” Tkalenko said. “Women are very reserved, and the information on rape cases is more closed.” Much of the evidence collected by Ukrainian prosecutors will soon be forwarded to the international criminal court (ICC), which has launched an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. One volunteer who travelled into liberated areas north of Kyiv on 1 April to help evacuate residents said they encountered three naked women who emerged from houses and basements. One had been badly beaten and was taken away by ambulance, they said. The volunteer said they also witnessed about 10 other women giving statements to police about being raped. “What usually happens is that rape victims initially want to tell their story, but then they go away and it isn’t until months later that they come back to talk,” the person said. Tkalenko says that when prosecutors hear about rape cases they approach victims individually and try to see if they will file a statement. “People are ashamed to talk about rape,” he said. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

4/25/2022,"Thousands of potentially harmful chemicals could soon be prohibited in Europe under new restrictions, which campaigners have hailed as the strongest yet. Earlier this year, scientists said chemical pollution had crossed a “planetary boundary” beyond which lies the breakdown of global ecosystems. The synthetic blight is thought to be pushing whale species to the brink of extinction and has been blamed for declining human fertility rates, and 2 million deaths a year. The EU’s “restrictions roadmap” published on Monday was conceived as a first step to transforming this picture by using existing laws to outlaw toxic substances linked to cancers, hormonal disruption, reprotoxic disorders, obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Industry groups say that up to 12,000 substances could ultimately fall within the scope of the new proposal, which would constitute the world’s “largest ever ban of toxic chemicals”, according to the European Environmental Bureau (EEB). Tatiana Santos, the bureau’s chemicals policy manager, said: “EU chemical controls are usually achingly slow but the EU is planning the boldest detox we have ever seen. Petrochemical industry lobbyists are shocked at what is now on the table. It promises to improve the safety of almost all manufactured products and rapidly lower the chemical intensity of our schools, homes and workplaces.” The plan focuses on entire classes of chemical substances for the first time as a rule, including all flame retardants, bisphenols, PVC plastics, toxic chemicals in single-use nappies and PFAS, which are also known as “forever chemicals” because of the time they take to naturally degrade. All of these will be put on a “rolling list” of substances to be considered for restriction by the European Chemicals Agency. The list will be regularly reviewed and updated, before a significant revision to the EU’s cornerstone Reach regulation for chemicals slated for 2027. Chemicals identified in the new paper include substances in food contact materials, single-use nappies and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) in granules for children playgrounds. But industry groups argue that the scheme’s focus on groups of chemicals could affect high street products such as sun creams and perfumes, which may use a host of synthetic substances. “A lot of different ingredients fall under the skin sensitiser group so a wide range of cosmetic products would potentially be affected,” said John Chave, the director general of Cosmetics Europe, a trade body. “The effect on consumers would be that there would potentially be less variety, less choice and less functional effectiveness for cosmetic products with no gains for safety whatsoever because the ingredients were safe in the first place.” Beyond cosmetics, affected products could include paints, cleaning products, adhesives, lubricants and pesticides. Europe’s Reach system is already the world’s most extensive chemical register, and new bans could hit more than a quarter of the industry’s annual turnover of around €500bn (£420bn) per year, according to a study by the trade group Cefic. “Some of the restrictions may have a significant impact on the industry and value chains,” said Heather Kiggins, a Cefic spokeswoman. The industry argues for a more narrowly targeted approach to restrictions, and for incentives and import controls to help develop safer alternative products. Nevertheless, the European Chemicals Agency favours dealing with chemicals in groups because pharmaceutical firms have previously avoided bans on individual chemicals by tweaking their chemical composition to create sister substances that may also be dangerous, but which then require lengthy legislative battles to regulate. The industry tactic, known as “regrettable substitution”, has been criticised by environmental groups for allowing the replacement of substances such as the endocrine-disrupting bisphenol A with other bisphenols. Santos described it as “a cynical and irresponsible tactic by the chemical industry to replace the most harmful banned chemicals with similarly harmful ones not yet on the regulatory radar. We’ve witnessed a decades-long pattern of regrettable substitution to avoid regulation.” More than 190m synthetic chemicals are registered globally and a new industrial chemical is created every 1.4 seconds on average. The UN says that it expects the industry’s global value of more than $5tn (£3.9tn) to double by 2030 and to quadruple by 2060. The EU’s environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said the new restrictions “aim to reduce exposure of people and the environment to some of the most harmful chemicals, addressing a wide range of their uses – industrial, professional, and in consumer products”. The EU’s internal markets commissioner, Thierry Breton, said achieving a toxic-free environment would demand transparency and visibility from the commission. “The restrictions roadmap provides such visibility, and allows companies and other stakeholders to be better prepared for potential upcoming restrictions,” he said. Millions of tonnes of chemical substances were used by industrial giants such as BASF, Bayer, Dow Chemicals and ExxonMobil without completing safety checks between 2014 and 2019, according to research by German environmentalists.",News/Environment,EU unveils plan for ‘largest ever ban’ on dangerous chemicals,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/eu-unveils-plan-largest-ever-ban-on-dangerous-chemicals
4/25/2022,"He came on horseback and ​wore a scowl as he spoke, telling thousands of yellow-clad believers they faced a momentous battle of good versus evil. “Good has always triumphed – and this time it will be no different. Good will prevail!” the outsider bellowed as his followers encircled the stage that had been erected to welcome him to this sweltering satellite town in north-east Brazil. The speech-maker was Jair Bolsonaro, the Bible-quoting, far-right populist championed in almost celestial terms by his supporters. “I love him. He’s my warrior,” said Diego Rodrigues da Silva, 27, an evangelical Christian who had ridden to the event on a bicycle painted with the word “Jesus”. “Wherever he goes, I go too,” said Rosaria Valente, 65, from the Amazon city of Belém. She called Bolsonaro “the only real president I’ve ever seen”. Minutes later, the throng erupted in euphoric cheers as their trailblazer arrived on a white horse with his country’s yellow and green flag draped over its neck. “Brazil above everything,” Bolsonaro shouted. “God above all,” they screamed back – the slogan of Bolsonaro’s illiberal administration since his shock 2018 election win. That administration will seek to extend its stay in power in October when 150 million Brazilians choose the next leader of Latin America’s biggest democracy. With the struggle for power intensifying, Bolsonaro has been touring the country in an effort to project strength and popularity and win back millions of voters who abandoned him as a result of his bungled response to Covid and the consequent economic and social pain. “All of us have a mission here on Earth and my mission was one of the thorniest a head of state could face,” Bolsonaro told the Parnamirim rally, defending his handling of a disease which has killed more than 660,000 Brazilians and against which he claims not to have been vaccinated. At the start of this year some Bolsonaro opponents hoped his chances of a second term had evaporated, with polls showing a yawning gap between the former army captain and his leftist rival, the ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro remains the underdog, abhorred by millions of citizens and shunned by much of the international community for his assault on Brazil’s environment and democracy. More than half of Brazilians say they would never vote for him. But in recent weeks Bolsonaro’s polling has improved, dashing progressive predictions that he was out for the count. “I don’t think the election is won – far from it,” said Jairo Nicolau, the author of a book exploring Bolsonaro’s astonishingly resilient support base. Nicolau still considered Lula the clear favourite thanks to his popularity among female voters, north-easterners and the poor. But the election is still six months away and the spell Bolsonaro has cast over many conservatives – a “cultural phenomenon” Nicolau likens to Trumpism – meant he was no ordinary foe. Barring economic meltdown, millions of Bolsonaro voters would stand by their man. “It’s truly remarkable. He has established a rapport with part of Brazil that’s really rare for a politician. It’s almost as if he’s a footballing idol … They see Bolsonaro as a hero,” Nicolau said. Such veneration is obvious in Parnamirim, a conservative city that grew around an airbase built to support allied efforts in the second world war and is home to many military officials. “He’s a visionary,” said Marcelo Chianca, 73, who cruised to the airport to greet Bolsonaro on his three-wheeled motorcycle. White, well educated and well-off, Chianca, a wine-loving retired economist, is a typical representative of Bolsonaro’s base. But he also enjoys support on Parnamirim’s dilapidated outskirts, partly thanks to billions of pounds in welfare payments being dished out ahead of the vote. “He has a real connection to the poor,” said Ana Paula da Silva, an evangelical 29-year-old who is pregnant with her fourth child and survives on an £80 monthly government allowance called Auxílio Brasil. Logic suggested her husband would support Lula. Ronaldo Cavalcante was born into rural poverty in the same town, Garanhuns, as Brazil’s first working-class president. He once worked for one of Lula’s cousins. But Cavalcante, a 38-year-old gardener, was also a Bolsonaro fan and said he would consider giving their unborn child the president’s second name, Messias. “It’s a beautiful name, isn’t it?” he said. “To tell you the truth, of all the politicians we’ve had, the one I’ve most admired is him.” The potentially tight nature of what looks set to be a two-horse race between Bolsonaro and Lula has left many bracing for a fraught and possibly violent period. Adding to those fears are the tens of thousands of firearms that have gone into circulation under a pro-gun president who has dramatically loosened gun laws. Critics accuse Bolsonaro of inviting disorder with his confrontational language. “An armed population will never be enslaved,” he told supporters in Parnamirim, several of whom wore T-shirts stamped with images of revolvers or assault rifles. Elisangela Silva da Costa Palombo, a leftwing activist and teacher who lives nearby, voiced outrage at the divisive “good and evil” rhetoric being used by Bolsonaro. “No matter how many times he says he represents good, he’s actually evil disguised as good – and people are waking up to this,” she said. Lindomar Alves de Sousa, a softly spoken evangelist who was part of Bolsonaro’s reception committee, recognised the president’s “brutish style” but said it was necessary as he was striving to save Brazil from what he called communist totalitarianism. “He’s not a polished guy – but he’s doing what we want done,” the 58-year-old preacher said after evening worship in his church, Heal Our Land. The next morning Sousa joined Bolsonaro on stage in Parnamirim wearing a yellow jersey symbolising his loyalty. “God lifted up this man and no one touches those lifted up by God – no one!” the evangelist proclaimed, urging supporters to raise their arms in prayer. “Our dear father, we thank you for the life of our president. It was for this moment in history that you raised him up – and you, Lord, will sustain him.” As Bolsonaristas streamed out of the event they passed the right-wing activist Wagner Sabino, who was hawking copies of a self-published book denouncing a supposed leftwing media conspiracy against the president. “Why did I write this?” Sabino asks in the introduction to ‘Bolsonaro v The Press: Distortions, Lies and Fake News’. “Simple: because I believe in my country and I do not want it to be seized by the left again … I believe I’m one of millions of cogs God is using to rescue this nation.” Sabino, 39, claimed Bolsonaro was being unfairly demonised by leftist infiltrators in the media: “They paint him as a monster … but increasingly people realise he’s nothing of the sort: that he’s a simple, common, good person.” Suddenly, Bolsonaro devotees spotted their captain departing via light railway and Sabino’s voice was overwhelmed by their exhilarated chants. “Do you really think a person like this will come second?” the author wondered as his compatriots howled in delight. “No way! It’s a lie!”",News/World news,‘Like a football idol’: Bolsonaro claws back support after poor Covid response,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-president-claws-back-support-after-poor-covid-response-
4/25/2022,"In the example clues below, I explain the two parts of each one. There is a definition of the answer and there is some wordplay – a recipe for assembling its letters. In a genuine puzzle environment, of course, you also have the crossing letters, which hugely alleviate your solving load. Also, here, the setters’ names tend to link to profiles of the individuals behind the pseudonyms. When I began solving cryptics, without a series of handy hints like the one you’re reading now, I sometimes wondered: if I take a dictionary and look up what I think is the answer, should I see underneath the part of the clue that I think offers the definition, but perhaps not expect that to work the other way round? I was right, pretty much. Here’s a recent example from Pasquale in the quiptic, the Guardian’s puzzle “for beginners and those in a hurry”: 11d Bird seen in the museum (3)[ wordplay: some of the letters of (“seen in”) THEMUSEUM ][ definition: bird ] If we look up EMU in Collins Dictionary, we discover – among such extra details as its number of toes – that the EMU is indeed a bird. The entry for “bird”, though, does not single out the EMU. And so when Vulcan clues BIRD, he does it like this: 10a Perhaps hawk’s attempt to catch rook (4)[ wordplay: synonym for “attempt” containing (“to catch”) chess abbreviation for “rook” ][ BID containing R ][ definition: perhaps hawk ] By itself, “hawk” would not be helpful, because we’re not looking for a hawk; we’re looking for the sort of thing a hawk is. As such, we’re given a “perhaps”. This is especially useful when a definition would take the fun out of the exercise. Here’s Qaos: 12a Perhaps 2000 or 2020 players struggle to control Real’s midfield (4,5)[ wordplay: anagram (“struggle”) of PLAYERS containing middle letters of (“midfield”) REAL ][ LEAPYRS containing EA ][ definition: perhaps 2000 or 2020 ] If Qaos had used, say, “periods of 366 days”, we’d be writing in LEAP YEARS without any of the pleasure of manipulating PLAYERS and REAL. The setter might also use “say”: 19a Coke and rum originally served in saloon, say (3)[ wordplay: initial letters of (“originally”) COKE AND RUM ][ definition: saloon, say ] Here, Brendan uses “saloon” as an example of a CAR, but new solvers should be aware that “say” in a clue might also indicate EG (more Latin tips here) – and “eg” in a clue might also mean you’re being given an example of the answer. The quickest way of doing this job is the question mark. Here’s Vlad with some more birds … 21a Angry report on Dirty Duck? (8)[ wordplay: synonym for “angry” and soundalike of (“report on”) synonym for “dirty” ][ synonym for “angry” and soundalike of “foul” ][ definition: duck? ] … this time WILDFOWL. Newspapers have had various rules on this kind of thing down the years and sometimes an example seems to work as a definition without any embellishments; when it does and does not is the kind of thing that some setters and solvers enjoy discussing at great length. For now, though, two final things. We’ve looked at examples as definitions, but they can also of course be part of the wordplay, as in this from Picaroon … 10a Checks possibly amber clothing at home (5,2)[ wordplay: what “amber” is an example of, containing (“clothing”) synonym for “at home” ][ RESIN containing IN ][ definition: checks ] … for REINS IN. Finally, the word “say” in a clue unlocks many more possibilities than the two mentioned above. In the Brendan puzzle cited, every clue ends in “[…], say” as a masterclass in the ambiguities to which we all willingly and repeatedly subject ourselves. Enjoy.

4/25/2022,"It is a thrilling pairing on paper: the impossibly glamorous actor Monica Bellucci playing the impossibly glamorous soprano Maria Callas, a case of one diva paying homage to another. Bellucci looks every inch the part in an elegant black dress and hair pulled back for the trademark Callas look. She narrates from the opera singer’s posthumously published book of letters and unfinished memoirs, and this one-off, one-woman show gathers in emotion – perhaps inevitably so given the power of Callas’s voice (which we hear in recordings) and her melodramatic life. But it has eccentricities and off-notes too, including Bellucci’s delivery; she speaks with a wispy breathlessness, more Marilyn Monroe than Callas, and it is unfortunate that her voice does not always carry across the auditorium given Callas’s range. She lounges on a cream sofa, spot-lit on a darkened stage with luminous projections of Callas’s writing on the back screen and heaps of roses strewn at her feet. The set exudes a corny kind of romance: all that is missing is a man in a tuxedo with a rose held between his teeth. A gramophone next to the sofa plays music in pauses between Bellucci’s narration and it is moving to hear Callas’s glorious voice in pieces such as Madame Butterfly, La Traviata, Medea, Norma and Macbeth. This gramophone, intermittently spotlit, almost becomes the production’s louder, more expressive second character. It is confusing that the titles of the musical pieces are not given and there are other more serious failings in the show’s framing. Under Tom Volf’s direction, the back-screen shows the names of those Callas writes to as well as dates (although from my seat in the stalls I could not see the full screen). They range from her godfather, Leonidas Lantzounis, to Grace Kelly and various singers and musicians. We are given nothing more than their names, however little-known they may be. Neither do we understand the full meaning of some letters: she writes to Pier Paolo Pasolini about something that has happened which is left unexplained. She asks the Spanish soprano Elvira de Hidalgo if she can wear her jewellery on stage, but we do not know if the subtext here is that she wants to honour De Hidalgo or to symbolically take her crown. Because no greater context is offered, we struggle to join the narrative dots and distinguish the facts from strains of self-mythologising. It becomes hard to know if the production is aimed at opera aficionados (given the lack of basic signposting) or initiates (given its briefness). It lasts 75 minutes and only touches on the big events of Callas’s complicated life, from her difficult mother to her failed marriage to Giovanni Battista Meneghini and problems with her voice. But we do build a picture of her inner highs and lows. There is wide-eyed wonder at the effects her voice has on the crowds. The most charged letters come at the end of her nine-year relationship with Aristotle Onassis, who she writes to with desperate passion, but who breaks it off and marries Jackie Kennedy without telling her. There is, by the end, a sense of a disappointed woman who feels grateful for the life she has lived but insists that we can only ever rely on ourselves. Despite all the letters to her friends, the abiding emotion is loneliness.",Arts/Stage,Maria Callas: Letters and Memoirs review – Monica Bellucci’s homage to a superstar,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/25/maria-callas-letters-and-memoirs-review-monica-bellucci
4/25/2022,"Priti Patel’s refugee pushback policy has been officially withdrawn by the government days before a judicial review of the tactic was due to be heard in the high court. The government’s legal department acknowledged in a letter on Sunday that the plan to try to force people in dinghies back to France has been abandoned after Boris Johnson’s announcement that the Royal Navy would take over operations in the Channel. Patel’s officials last week received notification that the Ministry of Defence, which is now in charge of picking up refugees in the Channel, did not have permission to use the tactic, the letter said. The policy, which was finalised in the autumn by the Home Office, authorised and encouraged Border Force officials to stop migrant vessels in UK waters and forcibly redirect them to return to France. In January, Patel said pushing back boats was “absolutely still policy” when she gave evidence to the Lords justice and home affairs committee. In its letter, the legal department said the policy and procedures had been withdrawn and that the MoD joint commander had not had permission to authorise the use of turnaround tactics. The letter, which was signed on behalf of the solicitor general, said a “significant development” had meant the case would no longer proceed. “That development flowed from the prime minister’s announcement on Thursday 14 April 2022 that the Ministry of Defence was taking over primacy in respect of Channel operations with regard to small boat crossings. “As a result of a military order notified to the secretary of state for the home department’s officials earlier on 20 April 2022, the Ministry of Defence joint commander has not had permission to authorise the use of turnaround tactics,” the letter said. It said that if a decision were taken to use turnaround tactics in the future, it would only be after a full consideration of all relevant matters. “The secretary of state for the home department [Patel] has determined that: the policy and procedures, which are the subject of the ongoing litigation, are withdrawn; if a decision were taken to use turnaround tactics in the future, it would only be after a full consideration of all relevant matters, including the evolving nature of the small boats threat, migrant behaviour and organised criminal activity; and new policies, guidance and operational procedures would need to be formulated at that point.” Four organisations – the PCS union, Care4Calais, Channel Rescue and Freedom from Torture – had been granted permission by the court to challenge the Home Office policy, with the applications set down for a three-day hearing on 3 May. The climbdown comes as the nationality and borders bill reaches its final stages in parliament. The Lords has twice rejected parts of the bill that would severely penalise refugees arriving in the UK without visas, in line with their rights under the refugee convention. Patel had repeatedly said there was a legal basis for the pushback policy despite introducing express powers to turn back boats in the nationality and borders bill on the basis that there was no such current legal power. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “This humiliating climbdown by the government is a stunning victory for Home Office workers and for refugees. There is little doubt that lives have been saved. The pushbacks manoeuvre is extremely dangerous and represents a clear risk to life and limb. We were simply not prepared to allow our members to be placed in this horrendous position.” Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said: “I find it hard to believe that anyone within government thought that performing pushbacks in the Channel was a viable policy.” Sonya Sceats, the chief executive of Freedom from Torture, said: “This momentous climbdown by the government shows that change is possible when we come together. But we should never have had to take this government to court in order to defend the sanctity of life – it is scandalous that it reached this point.” Steven Martin of Channel Rescue said: “Pushbacks are a reckless endangerment to life and we have always maintained and reminded the government that they are unlawful. The violent forcing back of people seeking protection is abhorrent and deprives them of their right to asylum.” The Guardian disclosed on Friday that unpublished parts of the proposed pushback policy said the tactic would not be used against asylum seekers.",News/UK news,Priti Patel’s refugee pushback policy withdrawn days before legal review,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/uk-refugee-pushback-policy-withdrawn-judicial-review-priti-patel

4/25/2022,"Almost 90% of British households reported an increase in their cost of living last month as they were hit by escalating fuel, food and borrowing costs. Heaping further pressure on Rishi Sunak to increase his support for those on low and middle incomes, the Office for National Statistics said a quarter of all those in its survey were struggling to pay their bills and 17% had turned to loans or borrowing on credit cards to make ends meet. Debt charities and anti-poverty campaigners said the figures, which cover the last two weeks of March, were a shocking reminder that this year households face the biggest cut in their living standards since the 1950s. Jack Leslie, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the combination of shrinking pay packets and rising costs meant that the pressure on households was building. The ONS data was collected even before households felt the impact of April’s cost of living rises, when the cap on household energy bills went up by 54% and national insurance contributions increased by 1.25 percentage points. The ONS said that while rising bills affected most households across the country, “they are more likely to disproportionately affect those in the most deprived areas”. More than a third of the most deprived fifth of households in England had found it difficult or very difficult to pay their usual bills. “This [situation] is set to get worse, with the estimated number of households experiencing fuel stress hitting 5 million this month,” Leslie said. “Going forwards, the government must do it all it can to protect those who will be hardest hit – with support for low-income households a priority.” Inflation soared to its highest level in 30 years in March, driven by the rising cost of gas, petrol, food, footwear, furniture and clothing. Wages have risen in recent months but failed to keep pace with rising prices as employers attempt to keep costs in check. The ONS said that among those who pay energy bills, about four in 10 (43%) reported that it was very or somewhat difficult to absorb the higher costs in March, even before the latest price cap increase in April. Illustrating the growing divide between the poorest areas of England and the wealthiest as the cost of living crisis worsens, more than half of adults (57%) living in the most deprived places reported difficulty in affording their energy bills compared with about a third of adults (35%) in the least deprived one . Sunak has claimed he is spending £22bn to alleviate the pressure on households, mainly through a 5p cut in fuel duty and a reduction in gas bills via a £150 council tax rebate that has already taken effect and £200 cut in October, although this is a loan that must be paid back over the subsequent four years.",News/Business,Almost nine in 10 British adults say their living costs are rising,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/british-living-costs-ons-bills-fuel-food
4/25/2022,"In 2014, I attended the Copenhagen Fashion Summit – the world’s largest fashion event about sustainability. At the time, I was a fashion journalist who prided myself on covering anything that was new and exciting – emerging designers, fresh perspectives on style, trends. But something was wrong with the way we consumed and communicated fashion. Epiphany came in the form of Vanessa Friedman of the New York Times. She strode on to the stage carrying a pile of jeans and threw them on to the floor, demonstrating their disposability, before proceeding to share her perspective on the fashion status quo – high street retailers dropping collections weekly and fashion designers creating six to eight collections a year. “It’s all unsustainable,” Friedman declared. “The answer lies not in sustainable fashion, which as a phrase makes no sense, but by building a sustainable wardrobe that works and has value for the person who has built it. I bring the same four dresses, two jackets and two pants with me everywhere.” Friedman was ahead of her time in acknowledging a carefully edited capsule wardrobe as a route to living more sustainably. These days, we don’t have a choice but to change our approach to dressing – with the climate crisis high on the international agenda, an edited-down wardrobe is one way to reduce our impact on the planet. This isn’t hyperbole. According to data analytics and brand consulting company Kantar, the global market for new clothes is expected to increase by 3.9% each year by 2025. But it is predicted that demand for cotton will outstrip supply. So what can be done? The savviest sustainable thinkers today are focused on how to live a less disposable life, with better quality, longer lasting, practical items that don’t require regular replenishment. Jessica Sansom is one of the protagonists hoping to shift our thinking with the latest project she’s working on. She is the sustainability director at Huel, the vegan food brand that offers nutritionally complete meals to people who want to eat healthily without spending time on meal preparation, and eliminate food waste. The brand’s latest project, though, is clothing. Launched this month, Huelwear doesn’t subscribe to seasons, trends or discounts, and focuses on leading consumers away from fast fashion. The fact that Huel is making serious moves into the fashion industry might surprise some, but for Sansom, it’s fitting that those who care about food ethics also care about fashion ethics. “We’re applying Huel’s principles to clothing,” says Sansom. “Our clothes are Intertek vegan certified. The physical durability of our garments is also crucial. We focused on what people own and wear on a regular basis and built high-quality pieces using organic, traceable and recycled fabrics.” Just as Friedman relies on four dresses, two jackets and two pants to see her through, Huelwear’s high-quality staples could be the beginnings of your capsule wardrobe. And those who have made the transition to a simpler dressing approach are already reaping the rewards. Chris Connors is a sound meditation practitioner who runs his wellbeing app OPO between London and Ibiza. His wardrobe works for both locations. “Back in my days training at a monastery, robes were all we wore,” says Connors. “And these days, I’m good if I’m wearing relatively similar things all the time.” His key pieces are three black trousers, one for fitness, one for every day and a silk pair for smarter occasions. For tops, he wears organic white cotton T-shirts, a black hoodie and a black blanket knit cardigan. He buys one pair of socks a year, and replaces his sneakers when they wear out. While Connors finds his edited-down wardrobe liberating, Petro Stofberg has made a business out of it. Co-founder of the popular website and Instagram account Wardrobe Icons, Stofberg educates her users on the building blocks of a sustainable wardrobe by recommending only quality, long-lasting pieces. “My go-tos are a white T-shirt, stripe knit, trench coat, and jeans,” says Stofberg, who notes the bestselling item on her website year after year is a striped T-shirt. Huelwear’s collection is similarly rationalised: 18 pieces for men, women and kids in three colours – black, white and grey – picked because they work in every wardrobe and are immune to trends. But its biggest promise is a five-year guarantee. While most garment producers wash-test a garment only five times, Huelwear is washed up to 50 times. If the piece falls apart before its five years is up, they’ll repair or replace it for free. “We certainly don’t have all the answers yet, but we want people to buy less clothing because they’re really happy with what they’ve got from us,” says Sansom. “We hope by sharing our research people can understand the effort we have put into creating, say, our T-shirt, and if they loved that T-shirt and wore it for years and changed their behaviour in the process, what a result that would be.” Shop Huelwear’s sustainable clothing collection here",Huelwear - clothes for the conscious,Capsule collections: can a streamlined wardrobe help you live more sustainably?,https://www.theguardian.com/huelwear-clothes-for-the-conscious/2022/apr/25/capsule-collections-can-a-streamlined-wardrobe-help-you-live-more-sustainably
4/25/2022,"Julian Hearn isn’t easily derailed by a challenge. As founder and chief marketing officer at complete nutrition brand Huel, problem solving is the norm for him and his team. Launched in 2015, Huel – a portmanteau of “human” and “fuel” – offers a range of nutritionally balanced, convenient plant-based meals, with minimal impact on the environment. And now, with the launch of an 18-piece clothing collection named Huelwear, Hearn is applying that ethos to fashion.“We’re about sustainability from the ground up,” Hearn says. “We started from scratch, with a clean piece of paper, saying: ‘What would this range look like if we did it properly?’” And so, Huelwear rests on a number of core values, taking in everything from what the garments are made of and how they’re made, to how you’d be able to integrate them into your wardrobe in the long term. Hearn is serious about Huelwear providing a counterpoint to the fast fashion industry’s bloat. Central to Huelwear’s production philosophy is consideration of the materials used in each garment. Huelwear is animal-free at every point in its supply chain, and is built to last. Hearn says he knows what it’s like to watch a garment fall apart after a few wears. “They haven’t been designed particularly well; they haven’t been constructed particularly well. And sometimes the fabric choices are wrong.”Huelwear’s range of adult and children’s performance wear, loungewear, accessories and classic denim is vegan-certified and made of single materials rather than fabric blends wherever possible – clothing is easier to recycle when it’s made from one material. Next, along the supply chain, Huel embraces a hands-on approach to ethical and quality controls. “Because we’ve got a much smaller capsule range, we’re able to have a cleaner and smaller supply chain,” says Hearn. Factories at every step of the manufacturing process are independently audited. “If they don’t meet the standards, we wouldn’t work with them. And for the partners we do choose to work with, we’re always looking for ways to do things even better.”Fast fashion’s pace of production, which sees online stores and shop floors flooded with new items multiple times a month, can lead to a squeeze on supply chain ethics. Hearn sees Huelwear as an antidote to that. From the cloth and dyes of a T-shirt to the buttons on jeans, he’s committed to the brand’s holistic approach. “Eventually, when five or six factories have made different component parts of a garment, we want to have visited and checked all of those elements,” he says. Now that Covid restrictions are lifting and travel is becoming easier, the goal is to do so beyond the European factories Huelwear has already checked out in person. Huel has partnered with sustainability platform Green Story, which works with more than 30 clothing brands ranging from high fashion to high street, to accurately measure the impact of each piece in the clothing range. “The good thing is, Green Story is independent,” Hearn says. “It’s very easy for a company to say: ‘We’re doing great things,’ but that’s harder to prove if it’s your own numbers.” Partnering with Green Story, for Hearn, means customers can trust a third-party company to break down complex data into clear benchmarks of energy and water saved by Huelwear compared with conventional garments. Finally, there’s the personal element. Huelwear touches on values of timelessness and long-lasting design that run counter to throwaway culture. Fast fashion, bought cheaply, tends to be disposed of as micro trends change. “Sometimes brands launch new products every day. It means that some clothes are worn as little as four times before they’re thrown away,” Hearn says. “And you just think: ‘Why are people buying stuff and getting rid of it so quickly?’”In contrast, Huelwear’s collection is backed with a five-year guarantee, which means that if something is wrong, an item will be repaired or replaced free of charge. The brand is also working on a circular production approach that will let customers resell their Huelwear items, and end-of-life garments will be recycled into new products. The goal is to keep everything Huelwear makes out of landfill, forever. “I’ve got clothes that are probably 10 or 20 years old, and I still love wearing them,” Hearn says. Huelwear’s quality fabrics, rigorously tested designs and clean silhouettes mean its customers should expect the same from the clothes they are buying. From ethics and manufacturing to longevity, the idea is to give you pieces that will seamlessly slot into your existing wardrobe. “I’m not saying it’s been easy – it’s been very tricky,” says Hearn. “But we’re building from the right foundations.” Shop Huelwear’s sustainable clothing collection here",Huelwear - clothes for the conscious,Guilt-free apparel: the ethical clothing brand providing an alternative to fast fashion,https://www.theguardian.com/huelwear-clothes-for-the-conscious/2022/apr/25/guilt-free-apparel-the-ethical-clothing-brand-providing-an-alternative-to-fast-fashion
4/25/2022,"The Conservative party could lose more than 1.3 million voters if the government scraps its net zero target, research suggests. A report by the centre-right thinktank Onward, which counts the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, among its supporters, has found there is strong support for tackling the climate crisis among Tory voters despite attempts by some on the right of the party to campaign against the measures. A small group of about 20 Conservatives last year formed the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG), which has been campaigning against measures to tackle the climate emergency and trying to link net zero plans to the cost of living crisis. The group is linked to the Global Warming Policy Foundation thinktank, which has denied there is a climate crisis. Steve Baker, a leading member of the NZSG, recently shared a report denying the crisis. These efforts do not seem to have worked, as there is support among Conservative voters for the net zero target, according to a poll by Public First for Onward. It conducted two nationally representative polls on 15-23 February and 6-7 April, of 4,021 and 2,008 people respectively. It found nearly half (46%) of voters said they would be less likely to vote for a party that pledged to get rid of the net zero target. Only 15% said it would make them more likely to vote for such a party. Ditching net zero is unlikely to win back those 2019 Conservatives who say they no longer support the party; among this group, 51% say they would not vote for a party that got rid of the net zero target, while only 18% said they would vote for such a party. The report warns against complacency, pointing out: “There is a noisy campaign on the right of British politics, including from Nigel Farage, for greater accountability over net zero policies.” It says there are concerns from the Treasury over the costs of net zero and that voters remember diesel cars and combi boilers they were told to buy by previous governments ended up being costly. While those campaigning against net zero measures claim they are speaking on behalf of the poorest in our society, saying they will be forced to be “poorer, colder and eat insects” under climate action plans, there is strong support for climate measures among working-class voters. The report found working-class Tories were more supportive of investing in renewable energy and more optimistic about new jobs in manufacturing than affluent Tories. The authors said: “Any assumption that the Conservatives’ working-class voters are particularly sceptical about the benefits of net zero would be completely unfounded, according to our data.” The Conservative MP Alexander Stafford, the vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on the environment, told the Guardian: “Action on net zero is electorally popular – thats why all major parties included it in their 2019 manifestos. Recent events such as the cost of living crisis and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine demonstrate that the need to push harder on net zero has never been greater. Any party who was to be seen as scaling back environmental ambition would not be thanked by voters. The Conservative party should continue to build on the work they have done to bring the country closer to net zero.”",News/Politics,"Tories could lose 1.3m voters if net zero target ditched, says poll ",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/tories-lose-voters-net-zero-target-ditched-poll
4/25/2022,"In 2012, Julian Hearn was mixing various powdered ingredients together in his Aylesbury kitchen. The results of those experiments have led to an annual turnover of more than £100m, with products that boast some of the most passionate and engaged customers of any nutrition product on the market. His own culinary upbringing, however, was a distant cry from what he would one day create for the masses. “I grew up in a time when people did a lot more home cooking, you’d maybe have a takeaway once or twice a year back then,” says 50-year-old Hearn. Growing up, his favourite meal was his mum’s Sunday roast followed by homemade trifle. Today, he is co-founder and chief marketing officer at Huel, leading the way in converting new customers to the brand’s vegan, sustainable and nutritionally complete meals. Realising there was demand for the benefits of a nutritionally balanced diet without the hassle of having to cook, for months he worked with nutritionist and Huel co-founder James Collier to create the company’s original formula: a powdered meal that contained the perfect amount of protein, fat, fibre, carbs and essential vitamins for the body to thrive. You just had to add water, shake, then drink. But just like cronuts, kale and craft beer, not everyone was sold on the idea when Huel first launched. The people who get it are incredibly passionate “The main feedback was that it was a very polarising product,” says Hearn. “We’ve been raised and taught that food should look or be a certain way, and people couldn’t get into their heads that the primary purpose of food is nutrition.” Once launched in 2015, Huel quickly garnered attention – not all positive. “It was called ‘the Matrix diet’ and ‘gloop’ and all sorts of negative things,” says Hearn. “But lots of people read between the lines.” It was this divided reaction that highlighted to Hearn how crucial media – social and traditional – would be to the brand’s success. Though some people laughed, Hearn found that more were actually interested in the product. “Loads of people got in touch on social media afterwards, saying they’d heard about Huel, saw the benefits and wanted to become customers. “The people who do get it and do like it are incredibly passionate,” says Hearn, who has previously worked for some of the UK’s biggest consumer brands, including Tesco, Waitrose and Starbucks. “We have some of the most engaged and passionate customers I’ve ever seen at any brand I’ve worked for.” Huel has now sold 200m meals in more than 100 countries, and has expanded its product range from Powder into Ready-to-drink, Hot & Savoury, Complete Protein and Bars, all linked by the commitment to complete nutrition. “We realised that people wanted to be connected to the brand, they wanted to be more involved, and they were proud to be a customer.” And what did this incredibly passionate fanbase want? Clothing (or, at least, more of it). The clothing industry has lots of fundamental problems Since its launch, Huel has sent a free T-shirt out with every first order. The black and grey tops bear the company’s logo on the chest and have become something of a uniform for fans of the brand – collectively known as “Hueligans” – who have been long hoping for an expanded range. Now, Huel has its sights set on solving other sustainable problems, taking its ethos of “minimal impact on animals and the environment” into your wardrobe. “The more we looked into expanding the range, the more we saw just how much people wanted it,” says Hearn. “But the clothing industry has lots of fundamental problems with how it’s structured and the harm it does to the environment.” So a years-long project began to investigate how Huel could answer customer demand while staying true to its sustainable ethos. The result is Huelwear. The initial collection comprises classic Huelwear T-shirts, alongside denim, hoodies, joggers and performance wear, all made sustainably. “It’s not just the fabric, it’s the way the factories are selected. It’s not just the design of the clothing, it’s the longevity you can get out of it. There are lots of elements that combine to make it a much more sustainable product, rather than just a tick-box exercise that some other brands do.” And Huel is indeed going much further than most other brands. All products are traceable back to the mills that produce the fabric, which have been selected for their ethical working practices and labour standards. All Huelwear products have been vegan-verified by Intertek, a multinational assurance, inspection, product testing and certification company, which certifies all Huelwear products as being animal-free at every point in its supply chain. Longevity is also ensured, with each product in the line backed by a five-year guarantee. If something goes wrong, customers can send it back to Huelwear to either repair or replace it, free of charge. Hearn hopes that Huelwear will inspire people to think beyond micro trends and the fast fashion churn they demand. “There’s definitely lots of areas across the board where we, as a society, have to be more sustainable. Unfortunately, sometimes the incumbents in an industry don’t think that way, so there has to be someone new to come along and do it differently.” Shop Huelwear’s sustainable clothing collection here",Huelwear - clothes for the conscious,Fans call themselves ‘Hueligans’: how a powdered meal became a cult brand,https://www.theguardian.com/huelwear-clothes-for-the-conscious/2022/apr/25/fans-call-themselves-hueligans-how-a-powdered-meal-became-a-cult-brand
4/25/2022,"While looking to replace some white T-shirts that were haggard beyond repair, I browsed the racks of a fast fashion retailer. Running my hands over various items, I encountered lurching seams, loose threads and unlined material so inadvertently sheer it would inevitably put your pants on show. These simply wouldn’t do. Like many consumers, I’m trying to shop more sustainably. That often means choosing secondhand or well-made new clothing that will last. The clothing industry is known to be a major polluter, producing 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions every year, while it is estimated to use around 1.5 trillion litres of water annually. Luckily, Huel, which started out as a plant-based complete nutrition brand, is branching out into fashion, bringing its environmentally conscious, animal product-free ethos to clothing. Huelwear, the new line by Huel, consists of 18 pieces of casual wear and caters for adults and children. That translates into a core rotation of timeless, well-cut basics that make dressing simple. The eco credentials are strong: GOTS-certified organic cotton and recycled nylon are just a few of the elements that make Huelwear clothes kind to your body and our planet. From joggers and hoodies to performance wear and jeans, each piece feels weighty in the right way and comes in plastic-free recyclable packaging – plus there’s no sign of wonky needlework. In an attempt to scrub my failed fast fashion foray from my memory, I tried a few of Huelwear’s pieces to see how they fare from the sofa to my daily commute to the gym. JeansHuelwear’s denim for women is designed in a skinny style and made of 99% organic cotton – 1% elastane is added for comfort. These jeans feel robust; they’re cut in 12oz denim, made using a special water-reclamation process that cuts waste by more than 1,200 litres and are rivet-free, so they’re easier to recycle. They’re also vegan, as they don’t have the leather patches most jeans feature. They stand up well to a day of work and an evening of pre-flight errands, earning a compliment from my close friend. I’m a tall woman, and a standard length shows an elegant sliver of ankle, but fits well. File these under a classic style, easy to dress up or down. ActivewearLet’s just say that the leggings feel as if you’re not wearing anything at all. They marry a super snug fit with breathable mesh panels and recycled Q-Nova nylon. Matching performance T-shirts boast the same credentials. Both do just as well during a HIIT workout (sorry to my downstairs neighbours) and while running a quick errand. Plus, the leggings really are squat-proof. Sports brasHuelwear’s black and grey sports bras hit a sweet spot of support – for small- to medium-sized chests, I’d say – and comfort. Like the performance wear, these bras are seamless, made up partly of recycled nylon and covered with an antibacterial finish over the mesh panelling. T-shirtsWe’re so often hunting for this: a soft T-shirt that doesn’t pill after about four washes. Huelwear’s crewneck T-shirts – in black, white and grey – use considerably less water in their production than a standard offering. And they feel what I can only describe as buttery-soft. These are GOTS-certified – an internationally recognised organic textile standard – cotton tops in a relaxed cut, with a solid medium weight that bellows quality. Perfect layered under a blazer for a smart casual look, or paired with a hoodie for a more relaxed look. Beyond these four pieces, Huel’s joggers have that soft, stepping-into-a-cloud feeling. Its matching hoodies, and the unisex fleece, which is made from recycled polyester, are warming without weighing you down. All the branding looks understated, and each garment comes with a five-year guarantee. If a piece falls apart before then (within reason), you’ll be able to have it replaced or repaired at no extra cost. Huel set up its food business with a minimal impact on the planet in mind, and it is applying the same logic here. Huelwear is all about looking forward to the future of fashion. About wasting less, and wearing more of the same pieces. Now, that’ll definitely do.
