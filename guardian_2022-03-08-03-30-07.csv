3/8/2022,"Fort Lauderdale’s now-former police chief has hit back at officials in the Florida city who fired him after just six months on the job, accusing him of focusing too heavily on a diversity policy in hiring and promotion. Larry Scirotto, 48, the son of a white mother and Black father and the department’s first openly gay chief, was fired last Thursday after a city report related examples such as how he’d once pointed to a display of photos of the department’s command staff in a conference room and said: “That wall is too white” and “I’m gonna change that.” But in an interview with Miami’s 7News, Scirotto denied that he’d made promotions based on minority-status. “The promotions I made of minority candidates were because they were exceptional candidates who excelled at every level of the organization, who deserved to be promoted and who were, by the way, happened to be minority – not because they were minority.” Scirotto was sworn-in as police chief in mid-August last year. By November, the city had hired a law firm to investigate complaints. CNN obtained a copy of the report that also said Scirotto had overlooked a white man with 20 years tenure with the department, and instead narrowed the choice for a job between two men of color, and asked: “Which one is blacker?” Interviewed by officials, Scirotto denied asking which candidate was “blacker” when deciding on the promotion, but admitted to making comments about the wall of staff photos being “too white” because, he felt, it did not reflect the ethnically diverse community the police department serves. The report said that Scirotto had responded that the context of his comment had been “built around ‘how do I convince the community that we are an inclusive and diverse organization if this wall is so white?’” It cited 21 witnesses on Scirotto’s hiring and promotion practices. The report concluded that “most believed that Chief Scirotto made clear his intention to promote based on race, gender or sexual orientation” and that “almost every witness was dissatisfied” with Scirotto’s approach to promotions. “Some believed it was about time changes were made, but stated if promotions were based on things such as race it would even hurt or undermine the people promoted,” the report said. But Scirotto warned that “minority groups are now being treated as less than deserving. That’s not the case, and it never was.” He told CNN the report that triggered his termination from the department was “vague on the facts”. In a statement the city said it had decided to cut ties with the police chief, who was not on a contract, saying: “After a thorough and extensive investigation of employee complaints at the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, City Manager Chris Lagerbloom has determined that it is in the City’s best interest to separate employment with Larry Scirotto.”, Scirotto joined the department after the Fort Lauderdale police were hit by accusations of internal turmoil and use of excessive force after officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas into a crowd protesting the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis, which sparked civil rights protests across the country and internationally. Scirotto spent more than two decades as a police officer in Pittsburgh, and was initially welcomed in the Florida post as an outsider untouched by cronyism. “I have a vision for the department,” Scirotto said at the time. “There are things we can do better. I know we don’t release the data publicly in a way I want to, so the public can see when we use force and the outcome of that force.” Police union chiefs were cautious. “The department is not broken,” said union president Brandon Diaz. “It doesn’t need fixing.” “It’s a wait-and-see attitude,” Diaz added. “The fact that he’s an external candidate leaves some unknowns. You don’t know what he’s going to bring, or what his vision is and how he’s going to move the department forward.” Among reforms Scirotto planned was to create a multi-cultural liaison unit to expand officers’ roles as liaisons to key groups that have traditionally been marginalized and undeserved. “I watched George Floyd in horror like hopefully every other law enforcement professional in America did,” he told the Sun Sentinel. “This is not a moment in time. This is a movement. We must change our tactics, our strategy, our training and the way we are accountable to the public for our actions.” Soon after being hired, Scirotto promoted 15 officers – nine were white men, six were minorities through ethnicity or gender. Four who were not selected for promotion – three men and one woman – filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “There would have been 12 white men, one white woman and two minorities if I had promoted as the complainants say I should have,” Scirotto told the paper. “Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. What would the optics have been on that?” Fort Lauderdale officials have indicated the city could rescind promotions made on Scirotto’s watch. But the former police chief has said he plans to maintain his position on the issue. “If I die on the hill for promoting diversity, as I was charged by the city manager to do from the day I was hired, then I will sleep well at night,” he told the South Florida Sun Sentinel.",News/US news,Fort Lauderdale ex-police chief hits back after being fired over diversity promotions ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/fort-lauderdale-ex-police-chief-fired-diversity-promotions
3/8/2022,"My friend Paul Martin, who has died aged 73 of pancreatic cancer, was a painter whose work was rooted in nature: preoccupied by the “scratchy, tough reality of things”. But his locations, and the figures which sometimes peopled them, were more metaphorical than representational: familiar but also otherworldly. Born in Bournemouth, Paul was the son of Alice (nee Moland), a secretary, and John Martin, a hydro-electric engineer, who died when Paul was 10. Paul grew up in Rugby, Warwickshire, and went to Dunsmore school, where he excelled at sport, leading a national schoolboy gymnastics team on a tour of Austria in 1964. He also joined an early incarnation of the Rugby-based pop band, Pinkerton’s Assorted Colours, as its drummer – without him, they went on to score an unlikely Top 10 hit with Mirror, Mirror in 1966. However, Paul’s abiding love was art, leading him to study painting at Birmingham School of Art and the Royal Academy. While still a student in 1971, he met Sandra Collins, then studying English at the University of Manchester. They were engaged within a week, married within the year, and stayed together for more than 50 years. Following his studies, and with a growing family, he became art master at Rugby school, a position he held for 20 years. Doc Martin – as he was universally known – inspired many of his students to become artists in their own right. Possessed of enormous energy, he continued to paint and exhibit, making a name for himself with large, often semi-narrative paintings, with themes and figures drawn eclectically from the Bible, ancient mythology and contemporary life. The encrusted, scarred surfaces of his pictures matched the imagery. Over the years Paul’s evolving Christian faith led him from the strict, evangelical Baptist tradition of his youth to an immersion in the much older tradition of Orthodoxy: finding a home in its rich iconographic heritage and liturgical forms. This was echoed in his paintings, whose distinctiveness spoke to a growing number of collectors, including the Royal Academy, the British Museum and the BBC. After his retirement from Rugby school, the final 10 years of his teaching career were spent at the Leith School of Art in Edinburgh. During this period, the human figure disappeared from his paintings, and he became preoccupied with the physical landscape, without surrendering to the picturesque. He drew inspiration from thinkers such as Duns Scotus, Rainer Maria Rilke and Teilhard de Chardin, with whom he shared an intuition that God was somehow present in the very fabric, the materiality of creation. In his last year, figures tentatively made their way back into the picture frame. Paul was – to the end – alive to new horizons, new possibilities. He is survived by Sandra, their sons, Thomas, Henry and Ben, and five grandchildren.",Arts/Art and design,Paul Martin obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/07/paul-martin-obituary
3/8/2022,"My brother Ian Gilchrist, who has died aged 69 after complications due to cancer, was a software salesman who served as a Liberal Democrat councillor in Bath for many years, and in 2017-18 as the city’s mayor. He was born in Oxford to Dorothy (nee Hudson), a teacher, and Andrew Gilchrist, a chemical engineer. The family lived in Cheshire for his first few years and then moved to Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. The eldest of five children, he went to St Albans school and then Magdalen College, Oxford, taking a degree in philosophy and psychology. Friendship with an Iranian lodger encouraged Ian to travel to Iran after graduating in 1976, and he taught English at the University of Tehran, exploring a new landscape of mountains and deserts. The Iranian revolution forced him to leave three years later, after which he found work with the British Council in Ljubljana, then in Yugoslavia and now in Slovenia. There he met a local woman, Gordana Djokic. After Ian had a brief spell teaching English in Saudi Arabia, they married in 1981 and lived in Ljubljana, where he translated material for the Unesco Centre for Chemical Education, until they came to the UK in 1983 and settled in Bath, Somerset. Ian and Gordana lived in Bath for the rest of their lives, raising their two sons, Robert and James, while Ian worked as a salesman for a software company, Cifer, in Melksham, before doing the same for IPL in Bath, taking early retirement in 2013. He joined the Lib Dems in 2003, and represented Widcombe ward in Bath as a councillor for 12 years until 2019. He was also elected chair of Bath and North East Somerset council before becoming mayor. As a player of many instruments, including the cello, banjo, oboe and mandolin – and having founded the Widcombe Mummers in 2005 – he made music the theme of his mayoral year. As he got older, Ian added sailing, beekeeping, mead-making, bridge and backgammon to his fondness for travel and mountaineering. Inspired by his love for Iran and Persian poetry, he had recently begun to study for a master’s degree in Persian studies at Soas University of London. He was a constant source of advice and encouragement to his friends and family, and his tastes and sense of adventure were an inspiration to many.

3/8/2022,"Joe Biden attracted criticism from both progressives and Republicans after a report indicated the White House was planning a visit to Saudi Arabia to discuss global oil supply. Axios reported on Sunday that Biden’s senior advisers were considering a spring trip to Saudi Arabia in an effort to improve relations and to propose a potential increase in oil exports. The Biden administration did not confirm. The White House did not respond to a Guardian request for a comment. The report comes as the US and its western allies consider banning imports of Russian oil in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The White House had dismissed a ban, out of concern for how it would limit oil supply and further drive up gas prices which have already hit a 14-year US high. But the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, indicated on Sunday that the west is warming to the idea of a ban on importing Russian oil. “We are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while of course, at the same time, maintaining a steady global supply of oil,” Blinken told NBC. A ban on Russian oil imports would have a substantial impact on the US and allies, particularly European nations. In 2019, Russia provided 41% of natural gas imports to European Union countries. If another oil-producing nation like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela started exporting more to the US and the EU, such shipments could help fill the gap created by a Russian ban. According to reports, Biden administration officials flew to Caracas on Saturday to discuss easing sanctions on Venezuelan oil. But such attempts to find other oil suppliers sparked outrage among some lawmakers. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a member of the “Squad” of progressives in the US House, accused Biden of turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia’s alleged war crimes in Yemen. “Our response to Putin’s immoral war shouldn’t be to strengthen our relationship with the Saudis who are currently causing the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet in Yemen,” Omar said in a tweet. “Yemenis might not matter to some geopolitically but their humanity should. This is [a] wildly immoral act.” Melanie D’Arrigo, a progressive congressional candidate in New York, argued the White House should take the opportunity to transition away from fossil fuels, reducing reliance on oil-producing countries. “Transitioning away from fossil fuels means our reliance on oil wouldn’t dictate our foreign policy and force us to align with murderous human rights abusers. We can save millions of lives and our planet with a Green New Deal,” D’Arrigo said on Twitter, referring to the progressive platform to substantially reduce America’s greenhouse gas emissions. Republicans said potential outreach to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela underscored the need to increase domestic oil production. “America can easily replace #PutinOil by producing more of our own,” said Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate intelligence committee. “Instead the Biden plan is to beg Saudi Arabia to produce more, buy more from a narco terrorist #MaduroRegime in #Venezuela [and] cut a deal with the [world’s] leading state sponsor of terror in #Iran.” A Republican congressman, Carlos Gimenez, echoed Rubio, saying: “Biden’s team would rather fly to Saudi Arabia, a country with whom we have a dicey relationship, to pump more oil rather than produce more energy right here at home. Everything this administration does is just so backwards.” Boosting domestic oil production runs counter to Biden’s promises to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and help transition the US to renewable forms of energy, one piece of Democrats’ broader agenda to address the climate crisis. Some critics noted that a warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia would also contradict Biden’s promises on the campaign trail. Biden said at a Democratic primary debate in 2019 he would force Saudi Arabia to “pay the price” for the 2018 murder of a Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence agencies concluded was approved by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS. “Khashoggi was, in fact, murdered and dismembered, and I believe on the order of the crown prince,” Biden said then. “And I would make it very clear we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them. We were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are.” In an interview published by the Atlantic this month, the prince had a pointed message for America. “We don’t have the right to lecture you in America,” he said. “The same goes the other way … You don’t have the right to interfere in our interior issues.” The piece itself caused controversy. The Washington Post responded with a column under the headline: The Atlantic’s elevation of MBS is an insult to journalism. The prince’s comments seemed to be a direct attack on Biden’s promise to crack down on corrupt regimes. Now, however, he and the Biden administration may be getting back into business.",News/US news,Biden criticized over report of planned Saudi trip to discuss global oil supply,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/joe-biden-saudi-arabia-oil-supply-criticism
3/8/2022,"My friend Claire Watkins was an American who devoted more than 30 years to education in Wales after moving to Newport in the 1970s. As headteacher of Maindee infants school, Newport, in the 80s, she encouraged bilingualism, training other schools in the Joan Tough teaching methodologies. Maindee was the first infant school to obtain the Schools’ Curriculum Award, established in 1982 by the Society of Education Officers and the editorial advisory panel of Education magazine to celebrate curriculum design and teaching. Claire then became part of the Gwent county staff development unit in 1991, initially as an adviser to nursery and primary schools. In the late 90s she undertook training to be an inspector of primary schools for Estyn, the Welsh equivalent of Ofsted. Born in Houston, Texas, Claire was the daughter of Emma (nee Vestal) and Emile Emmott, a banker. She attended Bellaire high school in Houston and then Baylor University in Waco, where she obtained her BA in elementary education and English in 1963. After graduation she moved to California and married her childhood sweetheart, Alfred Hildebrand, who was studying at Stanford University, in 1964. In 1967 they moved to Darmstadt, Germany, for Alfred’s work, and Claire taught primary level children at the American military school there. After two years they returned to California, where they adopted Elizabeth and Adam. Claire’s children attended a preschool at Stanford University that was underpinned by active research into child development by the likes of Jerome Bruner and Lilian Katz. Their work greatly influenced Claire; she later brought Katz to Wales as part of the continuing professional development of teachers. Her marriage to Alfred ended in divorce, and after Claire met Richard Watkins, a Welshman who was coaching rugby at Stanford, she moved to Newport when he returned home to study film. They married in 1974 and divorced in 1988. Claire worked in several Newport primary schools; she often spoke of her time at St Julian’s infants school, and she was deputy headteacher at Alway infants school. I first met Claire at Maindee in 1988, while looking for schools for my children. A qualified primary teacher myself, I was so impressed by Claire that I offered to volunteer at the school for an afternoon a week. In the next term a vacancy came up in the school for a reception class teacher and Claire strongarmed me into applying. She became a firm friend and a mentor in my career. After being brought up as a southern Baptist, Claire encountered the Quakers through her husband’s family and became a devout member. While at Maindee she was also introduced to Community House, a Welsh Presbyterian church led by the Rev Cyril Summers. After she retired from teaching in 2006, she became a trustee of Community House when it became a charity. Elizabeth died in 2020.

3/8/2022,"“Diego isn’t here any more, Robert Moreno is,” Robert Moreno said, but now he has gone too, Granada announcing that they had sacked their coach in a brief statement released at 12.37am on Saturday shortly after landing from Valencia. Eighteen minutes later, the B-team coach Rubén Torrecilla was named as his replacement. Moreno hadn’t lasted long – it is five-and-a-half months since that line, tone set early, and six-and-a-half since his first game – but it was longer than he had ever lasted before and longer than many expected, or wanted. Two days on, no-one has said goodbye. When he left the training ground on Sunday, Moreno did so quietly. He had taken charge of 29 games at Granada, 27 in the league and two in the cup, which at least was 13 more than his previous job, at Monaco. He was in the job before that, his first as head coach, for nine matches but those had been successful and his departure was supposed to be good news even for him. Assistant at the selección, he was made Spain’s caretaker until his friend Luis Enrique felt ready to return following his daughter’s diagnosis with cancer. There came a point when he didn’t seem to see it that way, though, which is why his tenure ended the way it did, in tears. That time, they were only his. When he left Monaco, he claimed that he found players and staff crying at the news that he wasn’t going to continue. This time, there are none. Granada have not won this year, picking up three points from nine, Saturday’s 3-1 loss at Mestalla their sixth in seven games. They are a single pointabove the relegation zone and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atlético Mancha Real from Group IX of the tercera división, somewhere below the 10th tier. But that’s not the only reason there was something oddly inevitable about this almost from the start, why his brief spell in charge might have been briefer, one paper describing the “chronicle of a sacking foretold”. The eighth manager sacked in primera this season could have been the first. Something never really felt right, even with the early optimism. Employed by the board before the new sporting director had arrived, the personal choice of director general Patricia Rodríguez, Moreno replaced Diego Martínez, which was some cross to bear. Martínez, the most successful manager the club ever had, brought them up and led them into Europe for the first time ever, reaching the quarter-finals and a meeting with Manchester United. Impossibly energetic, charismatic and hugely popular, he had built a team that was very much his. And even though he studiously stayed away, refusing to set foot in the stadium or be seen anywhere near it, heading to England at one point, Rodríguez admitted the former coach cast a “long shadow”. Following him wasn’t going to be easy. Moreno knew that, which was part of the reason it was even harder for him. “This team reached the summit, now it has to leap for the moon,” Moreno told Ideal not long after arriving. While survival was the objective, he said they would look to Europe too, suggesting that this team could be better than that one. More stylish, purer, a better football team. Instead, Granada were soon heading downhill. They didn’t wake up until September ended, finally collecting their first win at the start of October by beating Sevilla. The problem was that Granada only won one of the next seven, and it wasn’t even just that: it was him. Two goals in quick succession for Valencia! 🔥Gonçalo Guedes opened the scoring with this header before Maxi Gomez added another soon after 🦇 pic.twitter.com/ucEVDgBmn3 Even if you couldn’t quite put your finger on why, you wondered how long he would last as early as August. When fans started chanting “Robert, vete ya!” – “Robert, go now” – fewer than seven games into the season, you thought he really might be gone soon. And nor was it just results: it was something simpler, something almost too basic. He just didn’t feel like he belonged, like he was theirs. Moreno hadn’t exactly been given time and as the song went round, there was an ironic smile that made it worse. Afterwards, swivelling in his chair, shrugging a “so?”, he reminded them that Martínez wasn’t coming back. When Luis Enrique returned to the Spain job after the tragic death of his daughter, taking over from Moreno again, he publicly attacked his former assistant and now former friend for being “disloyal” and “over-ambitious”, immediately ditching him from his staff as he kept the rest. Moreno had initially said that he would be delighted to step aside but, after seven wins and two draws in nine games, he had started to think he might lead them into the Euros – and suggested that Luis Enrique wait. “Life shows you who people are,” Luis Enrique said of Moreno. “He labelled me with two very ugly things that I don’t deserve. I am not that,” Moreno insisted. He was probably right, but perhaps that lingered, conditioned the way he was seen. When he went to Monaco, he said that he had offers from “the five continents” but, interrupted by the pandemic, it didn’t work out. At Granada there was something in his attempts to distance himself from Martínez that felt almost dismissive, and fans who saw a man not so much trying to step out of Martínez’s shadow as fight his way out – and they didn’t much appreciate the punches thrown. They detected a hint of superiority that may not have been fair but they couldn’t help feeling it. Young, handsome, proud, they saw something a little chulo in him: chest out, jaw out too, pouting and defiant, defensive. At one press conference in December, the tension came to the surface. Asked about opponents Atlético, he replied: “I don’t have to answer that.” What about the four-four-two which seems to be going well, he was asked: “That’s why I use it.” Asked how defender Quini was: “You have to ask him.” Will you rotate? “Tomorrow you’ll see.” The next day he apologised, insisting: “I’m a human and I make mistakes … it was not my best day for personal reasons,” he said, noting that he had been trending on Twitter. All of which was fair enough – it is a miracle that players and managers don’t get shirty more often – but there wasn’t a great deal of warmth, even when they were winning. Which by then they were. That day, they defeated Atlético – part of a run of seven without defeat, equalling a club record. If there was a feeling that patience may have been rewarded, that they had found their feet, the manager accepting petitions to be more pragmatic, somehow there was still something they were not sure of, little affection. And then, despite spending €10m in the winter, they stopped winning again. Atlético was their last victory, and that was nine games ago. And so it ends, early but later than it might have done, resistance from the club’s ownership in China finally overcome after a couple of weeks on edge and a season that never truly felt secure. Granada have won only five league games from 27. On Saturday the captain Germán Sánchez insisted that the players believed in Moreno but no one has said anything since, no farewell and no thanks. The wife of Luis Abram, currently out on loan, declared: “At last! I’m sure better things will come.” Alavés 0-0 SevillaReal Madrid 4-1 Real SociedadValencia 3-1 GranadaEspanyol 2-0 GetafeOsasuna 1-0 VillarrealReal Betis 1-3 Atlético MadridCelta Vigo 4-3 Real MallorcaElche 1-2 BarcelonaCádiz 2-0 Rayo Vallecano They have to: next up, Granada face Elche, four points ahead of them, and Alavés, who are three points behind. “New manager, guaranteed victory,” the line goes and they had to try something. Besides, it has worked for others, not just at Barcelona but at the bottom, too. Levante went from no wins in eight to no wins in 15 when they changed from Paco López to Javier Pereira, but have a weensy bit of a chance now with Alessio Lisci in charge. There’s a glimpse of hope emerging at Alavés who have won one and drawn two of their last four under José Luis Mendilíbar. Under Fran Escribá, Elche won two of 14 and were 18th; under Francisco, they’ve won five and are five points clear of the relegation zone. Cádiz, who sacked Álvaro Cervera, are one point from safety having just won a top-flight game in front of their home fans for the first time since 2006. And Quique Sánchez Flores has performed a miracle at Getafe. At the same time as Getafe sacked Míchel and Levante bade farewell to Paco López, with fans singing for Robert to “go now” and many wondering if that might not be a bad idea, Granada won their first game of the season. “A liberation,” Moreno called it, but it didn’t last and now he has gone too.",Sport/Football,"Granada shed no tears for Moreno, the man who lost his battle with a shadow | Sid Lowe",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/la-liga-granada-roberto-moreno-diego-martinez
3/8/2022,"One of the ironies of the war in Ukraine is that the Kremlin’s finances benefit every time the crisis deepens. After Saudi Arabia, Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and it is out on its own as an exporter of natural gas. Countries producing more oil and gas than they consume enjoy windfall gains when prices rise – and Russia falls into that category. Conversely, countries not self-sufficient in energy suffer when prices are high because costs for business rise and consumer spending power is squeezed. There is a lively debate about whether the US is self-sufficient in energy, but it is certainly a lot less dependent on imports than the European Union, which gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia. Europe is a lot more vulnerable to a loss of Russian energy supplies than the US, and that helps explain why the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is more cautious than Washington over extending the west’s sanctions regime to oil and gas – at least for now. After Antony Blinken, Joe Biden’s secretary of state, sent prices rocketing by saying the US and its allies were actively considering adding oil and gas to the sanctions list, Scholz said Russian energy was “essential” to Europeans’ daily lives. Boris Johnson also expressed caution, making it clear that a ratcheting-up of sanctions to include oil and gas could not happen overnight. The prime minister’s warning came as the cost of unleaded petrol on UK forecourts hit 155p a litre, according to the RAC. The International Monetary Fund is concerned about the impact of energy prices on a global economy still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, with the fear that the hit to demand in energy-consuming countries will not be offset by a increase in spending by energy producers. The economic consequences are already “very serious”, it says. At the start of 2022, the EU was paying €190m a day for the natural gas it received from Russia, but by the end of last week this daily figure had risen to €610m. The further increase in gas prices since means the bill will now be even higher. It is a similar story for oil, where in early trading the cost of a barrel of Brent crude briefly reached $139 – within striking distance of its record high of $147 a barrel in 2008. On some estimates, Europe is paying $285m a day for Russian oil. Nick Parsons, head of research for the renewable energy company Thomas Lloyd, said that in sterling terms, oil prices (unadjusted for inflation) were higher now than 14 years ago, owing to a lower exchange rate. In 2008, with the pound worth $2, a barrel of oil cost £73; at the current exchange rate of $1.31, it costs £106 a barrel. It remains to be seen whether Russia is actually reaping the full benefit of rising prices. Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, says sanctions are already having a marked impact on cross-border transactions, including as yet untouched oil and gas exports. Evidence for that, Shearing says, comes from the price differential between Brent crude – one of the global benchmarks – and Urals crude, the main Russian export blend. Before the invasion, Urals crude traded at an average discount of $2-$3 a barrel, but that has subsequently widened to almost $25 a barrel. With the rouble hitting fresh lows against the US dollar, Russia is already feeling the impact of sanctions. But so too – in the economic version of mutually assured destruction – is the west.",News/Business,West feeling impact of Russia sanctions too as oil and gas prices soar | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/west-impact-russia-sanctions-oil-gas
3/8/2022,"Three more Russian billionaires have resigned from the board of the $22bn (£17bn) investment firm LetterOne after the EU imposed sanctions on its two biggest shareholders. The company, which owns the health retail chain Holland & Barrett in the UK and a swathe of energy assets across Europe, said on Monday that German Khan, Alexei Kuzmichev and Andrei Kosogov had “resigned from all positions at LetterOne, including the board”. It said: “None of these three individuals has been sanctioned, but they believe that this is the right thing to do in the long-term interests of LetterOne, its employees and the many jobs it supports in its portfolio companies.” Last week the UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, LetterOne’s founder, and Petr Aven, who between them own just under 50% of LetterOne, had their shares in the company “frozen” after they were hit with EU sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The pair then stepped down from the London-based investment group. Mervyn Davies, the company’s chair and a former Labour trade minister, said he was determined to stay on at L1, despite repeated calls for him to step down. “The new board and I will focus on protecting the enormous economic and social contribution LetterOne makes,” Lord Davies said. “I am also determined to ensure that the 120,000 jobs throughout the UK, US and Europe are protected. We know that everyone involved in L1, including our founders, would want us to take these steps given their love and passion for and heritage in Ukraine.” Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative MP and the chair of the foreign affairs committee, told the Mail on Sunday that Davies should step down. “Some moments demand a choice, this is one,” he said. Davies said LetterOne would make a $150m donation to “support the urgent work under way to help those affected by the war in Ukraine”. The company said: “We know that everyone at LetterOne, including our founders, support this action. LetterOne’s shareholders have also agreed that all dividends from LetterOne will be paid to ongoing relief efforts for the foreseeable future.” Khan, who was born in Ukraine and helped to found LetterOne, said: “The majority of LetterOne founders have deep roots in Ukraine and the destruction of the cities where I spent my childhood and which are home to the graves of our ancestors is heartbreaking. The recent bombing of the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial centre, which we funded and helped create, feels inconceivable. “My partners and I stand for the earliest end to war and will do all we can to help those affected – whether employees of our businesses in Ukraine, or victims of the violence. We fully support the board’s actions in this matter.” Fridman and Aven were placed on the EU sanctions list last week but are not under UK or US sanctions. Fridman was described by the EU as “a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle”. Aven was described by the EU as “one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs” and an “especially close personal friend” of the Rosneft chief executive, Igor Sechin. “He is one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meet with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin,” the EU document said. The men have denied any “financial or political relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin” and said they would “contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions – vigorously and through all means available to them.” Fridman, who was listed as the UK’s 11th wealthiest person in the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated £11bn fortune, owns Athlone House, a £65m mansion in Highgate, north London. Aven, who has an estimated $5.5bn fortune, owns Ingliston House, near Virginia Water, on 8.5 acres of land in a gated estate next to Wentworth golf course. It boasts an art collection including works by Larionov, Goncharova and Kandinsky, as well as sculptures by Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore and Antony Gormley in the garden.",News/Business,Three more Russian billionaires resign from LetterOne board,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/three-more-russian-billionaires-resign-from-letterone-board
3/8/2022,"A row has broken out over Whitehall’s response to the incipient refugee crisis as a result of the war in Ukraine. Ministers have been urged to act swiftly to open Britain up to displaced Ukrainians – but on Monday morning there were mixed messages from the Home Office and No 10 over how far they plan to go. Here is what we know so far. On 28 February 2022, the home secretary, Priti Patel, told the House of Commons that a “bespoke humanitarian route” was being introduced for those fleeing the unlawful invasion of Ukraine by Russia. It meant that family members of British nationals could apply for a Ukrainian family scheme to enter the UK. However, this would apply only to spouses, unmarried partners of at least two years, parents or their children if one is under 18, or adult relatives who are also carers. This would initially allow them to stay for a year. Days later, and after criticism that the conditions were too restrictive and prevented many people with links to the UK from leaving Ukraine, they were extended to include a parent of a child who is over 18, grandparents, grandchildren or your partner’s grandchildren, brothers and sisters. No. On Tuesday, Patel announced a second route called the “humanitarian sponsorship pathway”, for Ukrainians who are sponsored by individuals, charities, businesses and community groups. The sponsors provide housing and integration support, while those who come under this scheme will stay initially for 12 months and they will be able to work and access public services. No. The government insists that applications are made on official forms and fingerprints registered, and official translations of documents provided. Family members say it is unfair to expect applicants to fill in an application form and hand over biometric data during a war. Refugees have to work out if they are eligible, then complete forms online, provide proof of their family links and evidence of their Ukraine residence, and give biometrics, including fingerprints, in person at a UK Visa Application Centre (VAC). They also have to translate documents in Ukrainian or Russian into English. Some Conservative MPs have claimed that the government should have shown the same generosity as the EU, which is allowing Ukrainians to live inside the bloc for a year without applying for a visa. Charities have said that the sponsorship pathway is not yet open and that it might take months to set up. France’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, wrote to Patel on Saturday, saying that the UK’s policies “lacked humanity” after 400 Ukrainian refugees had arrived at Calais to cross the Channel, but 150 were sent back and told to obtain UK visas at embassies in Paris or Brussels. Sources close to Patel briefed on Monday that one is being considered by the home secretary. However, a No 10 spokesperson and the Foreign Office minister, James Cleverly, have said that there will not be. It is likely. With almost 1.4 million people having already fled Ukraine, and projections that 4 million could leave if the conflict escalates, the UNHCR said the UK’s scheme may need to be rapidly scaled up to cope with the size of the crisis. Between 24 February, when the invasion took place, and 6 March, the gov.uk page “UK visa support for Ukrainian nationals” has been updated nine times, according to the Free Movement website. Expect further updates soon.",News/Politics,Ukraine: why is there dispute over the UK Home Office’s refugee plans?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/07/why-are-home-office-plans-for-ukraine-refugees-criticised
