4/6/2022,"With the click of a button and a few phone calls from Wolverhampton, in England’s West Midlands, Sharonrose Manhiri ensures her grandmother in Zimbabwe’s Honde valley receives her groceries every month. Manhiri is one of an increasing number of Zimbabweans who have settled overseas taking advantage of a range of food-delivery apps and websites that have sprung up in Zimbabwe to help their families survive the country’s deep economic crisis. Each month, from her home in the UK, Manhiri orders her 85-year-old grandmother, Victoria Samanga, supplies from a Zimbabwean online delivery company, Fresh in A Box. She then contacts a “runner” to collect the order from the city of Mutare, in eastern Zimbabwe, and take it the 80 miles (130km) to her grandmother’s home in the remote Honde valley. Although it can be complicated, “it is always worth it”, she says. “It is a big part of staying in touch with my roots, staying connected to who I am. It’s more than just sending groceries or money,” says Manhiri, 30. “It is how I stay connected to the most important person back home, which is my grandmother. “It is just for her to know that even though I’m far away, I am thinking about her upkeep and wellbeing.” It is a sentiment that became particularly important when Covid-19 stopped trips home. Zimbabwe’s diaspora – 3 million of whom live in neighbouring South Africa – has for years been instrumental in keeping the economy afloat and keeping people from going hungry, often sending money through money-transfer agencies such as Mukuru, WorldRemit and Western Union. The central bank reported diaspora remittances totalled $1.4bn (£1.06bn) last year, up from $1bn in 2020, defying expectations that the amount might drop during the pandemic. But more people are opting to send groceries directly now, rather than money, because it is cheaper. Cooking oil, for example, costs $3.50 to send to someone in Zimbabwe and paid for from South Africa, while it costs $4.50 to buy in Zimbabwe. And money-transfer agencies such as Senditoo are diversifying into grocery deliveries to meet the demand. Gamuchirai Mutume, 36, who lives in California, US, finds online grocery shopping more efficient. “I normally go online, order groceries and pay. The shoppers are so professional. If I order in the morning, by afternoon they would have been delivered. It is a very good and efficient process” she says. “I can take care of my family back home with ease.” Her aunt, Juliet Mbofana, who lives in Norton, about 25 miles from Harare, says: “I always look forward to receiving groceries from my niece. They always deliver at home, and this has been of great help during Covid-19.” Taking advantage of this rise in online deliveries, Simbisa Brands, which operates fast-food restaurants across Africa, has developed a platform called InnBucks, which allows Zimbabweans around the world to buy lunch or dinner for their families back home. For Aldrin Maimba, 36, a Zimbabwean living in Canada, buying his mother pizza every week keeps him connected to home and family. She orders, he pays directly from Toronto, and the pizza is delivered. “I miss my mother and I know she still loves her Hawaiian pizza,” says Maimba. “So, I use this app to buy pizza and other goodies for delivery at our home. It is very efficient. I just want to keep her happy since she stays alone at home.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Zimbabweans abroad switch to food delivery apps to help family at home,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/06/zimbabweans-abroad-switch-to-food-delivery-apps-to-help-family-at-home
4/6/2022,"Iwas born in north-east China in a province that was particularly heavy-handed with party propaganda. I learned to march in formation before knowing how to write, and maybe even count. Every morning at school started with a flag ceremony and obligatory salutes to Mao Zedong. Textbooks were illustrated with watercolour Lenins and Stalins, drawn to look much more handsome than they actually were. The propaganda made its way home as well. I think that, even to this day, my father knows only socialist songs. The life I’ve just described may sound extreme, but in fact it was a relatively free period in the 1990s, after the worst of our state terror and before Xi Jinping’s more recent crackdowns. We never had a democracy, but the 90s were as close to it as we ever got, and life was generally pleasant. The university where my mother taught arranged a one-room apartment for us in the city centre, within walking distance of the local Mao statue. Compared with today’s Chinese academics we couldn’t have been considered rich, but we were always able to buy fish, bananas and peanuts, and even Sprite and other western-branded gifts for my teachers in the hope that they would treat me well at school. I wasn’t considered patriotic enough to be class president; however, the school did allow me a young pioneer uniform when it was my turn to raise the flag. It was in the middle of this life that my father decided to move to the US for his doctoral studies. My mother followed within a year. I was sent to live with my grandparents and enrolled in the neighbourhood’s best school – that is to say, the most political. I clashed with the teachers almost immediately. These semiliterate relics from the Cultural Revolution couldn’t comprehend that times had changed enough for my parents to leave by legal means. To them, my parents could only be defectors, and therefore I must be an enemy of the people, at all of six years old. The other children were forbidden to talk to me, while I was forbidden to eat any of the school meals. Instead, I was expected to serve them. I remember very little of the anger and hatred I must have felt, but know that at one point I turned over an entire table of hot soup and burned one of the teachers. In hindsight, maybe all this could have been avoided if my grandparents had remembered to bribe the teachers with Sprite. I rejoined my parents later that year in a new country where the girls wanted to be Disney princesses instead of young pioneers. My Asian peers supplemented their English lessons with princess cartoons, and my parents, expecting me to do the same, borrowed piles of them every week. I initially watched them through communist eyes; in Cinderella, the plight of the proletarians against bourgeois greed was pretty obvious, but I couldn’t understand why she was allowed to live in a palace at the end. It would have made more sense if she had joined the Red Army after Prince Charming liberated her. And in Sleeping Beauty, I really sympathised with Aurora’s disappointment after finding out about her royal roots. It must have hurt to find out that she was an enemy of the people through no will of her own. What really changed me was the 1997 film Anastasia. Before the first song started and the first talking animal appeared, I saw some familiar faces, straight out of my former life in China: young revolutionaries storming a palace, with the same determined expressions, the same grey or green overcoats, the ushankas, the fists. These were people I recognised very well, only my Chinese schoolbooks drew them as liberators, and the American film drew them as a mob. I had up to that point not entertained the possibility that communist revolutionaries might be antagonists in any story. I hadn’t known it was even possible to look at them with such fear and hatred. When this world materialised, fully formed, around me, it was as if the sky had turned green, and was at the same time revealed to have been green all along. The most valuable gift from my American years was critical thinking – the ability to see that the way something is presented is not necessarily how things are. Even there it was not always encouraged, and was sometimes punishable, but at least it was possible to go through the school system and come out with a free mind, which, once earned, becomes the one freedom nothing can take away. Over the years I found out that my first home town in China, far from the homogeneous and nationalistic place I remember, is ethnically diverse, and had been much more so before the establishment of the current People’s Republic; in addition, it had once been a Japanese colony. And in fact, I’m not even Chinese, but Mongolian with some Turkic blood – now that’s a twist Princess Aurora might have appreciated. People of my ethnic groups had fought against the communists and, after Mao’s takeover of the region, were heavily assimilated. As there were so many non-Chinese influences for the communists to purge, the repression there was particularly heavy-handed. Although my parents did not discuss it much or openly, I eventually gathered fragments of stories about our family’s involvement in Mao’s revolution. Our relatives covered the gamut – some were direct perpetrators, some victims, others bystanders who, now on two continents, are surrounding themselves with the trappings of ordinary life in a desperate bid to forget. But paralysed as they are by the weight of memories, they are unable to work through them and move on. American passports and western goods haven’t been able to shift them towards life in a democracy. Eight years ago I left the US for another stepmother country, in order to remember what exactly it is that I may have survived. I chose Estonia, where people have the fortitude to look at the bloodbaths of the past with clear and unflinching eyes, and afterwards, willingly shoulder the responsibilities of democratic life. And I have thrown myself headfirst into this European life, with its endless academic freedom, a presidential palace within walking distance, the possibility of joining the army without bloodying one’s conscience, classmates running for parliament, The Death of Stalin in the cinemas, almost any professor just an email away, cakes and wooden houses and supreme courts in the same pastel colours, hot water available all day long and shops full of their Annick Goutal and Wolford and Fjällräven and so many brands we have to boycott most of them. Unlike a free mind, this beautiful reality can be taken away, and I feel constantly haunted by a past and a hypothetical future that must never come into existence. This is still a world in which authoritarian and totalitarian regimes attempt to extend their power some 30 years after the supposed end of history. I have disowned the propaganda of my childhood, yet have spent all my years of freedom with it, in my research during the day and my nightmares afterward. I still catch myself humming socialist ballads from the 1950s. Some have rather pretty melodies, and they’re so ingrained in me that it’s more a matter of muscle memory than anything else. And I’ve accepted the possibility of never making peace with the past. In the end, I suppose that there had always been a side of me that hated tyrants in all forms, and rarely took instruction at face value. The raw material for a free mind was always there, and when the opening scene of Anastasia swooped in, my first Socrates-gadfly, I was ready to question everything I had known, except for the innate desire to be free.

4/6/2022,"“Which football grounds are namechecked in songs? I’ll get the ball rolling with Hillsborough in Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured by Arctic Monkeys,” writes Agatie Fan on Twitter. Technically, as a few pedants pointed out, the Arctic Monkeys lyric refers to the suburb of Hillsborough rather than the stadium. But we’re in a good mood so we’ll allow it. And this song, too, which checks Old Trafford without actually naming it. “There’s an obscure Herman’s Hermits song called It’s Nice to Be Out in the Morning, written by professional songwriter and future 10cc bassist Graham Gouldman,” writes Martin Crookall. “It’s like a Manchester travelogue, culminating in a verse about ‘United’s ground where the champions score/ A hundred goals and the Reds’ fans roar/ for Bobby Charlton, Best and Law’, which is close enough to make no difference as far as I’m concerned.” We’ll be honest, when we first read this question we didn’t expect the Barenaked Ladies to provide an answer. But, as Neil Hickey points out, their 1998 megahit One Week mentions a football stadium in Canada. Not content with referencing everything from LeAnn Rimes to Chickity China, the Chinese chicken, they also pay tribute to “Birchmount Stadium, home of the Robbie ...” Birchmount Stadium in Ontario is the venue for the annual Robbie International Tournament, which prides itself on being the world’s largest annual charitable youth soccer tournament. James Walker writes in to remind us that Renato Dall’ara, a 2008 song by the kooky indie-pop seven-piece Los Campesinos!, is also the name of Bologna’s stadium. “My favourite is Dopamine Clouds Over Craven Cottage by ambient-drone duo Stars of the Lid, which appears on their And Their Refinement Of The Decline triple LP,” writes Richard Gunn. “One half of Stars of the Lid is composer Brian McBride, whose namesake was playing for Fulham at the time of the album’s release.” And whose goalscoring exploits are included at the start of the song. Finally, there are loads more examples below the original Twitter question, including Billy Bragg, Eminem, Luke Haines and, of course, Half Man Half Biscuit. “When was the last time the World Cup draw was made without the identities of all the qualifiers being known?” tweets Alastair Horne. We’re delighted to relate that we had almost no work to do on this one. In fact all we had to do was embed this tweet from Paul O’Neill. Oh go on then, we might as well add a bit of context. Spain and Yugoslavia finished level on points and goal difference, so they had to play off on a neutral ground. On 13 February 1974 in Frankfurt, West Germany, Josip Katalinski scored the only goal to send Yugoslavia to the World Cup. This game, incidentally, shouldn’t be confused with a more violent qualifier between the sides for the 1978 World Cup. “What’s the biggest difference in home attendances from one game to the next?” tweets Jack Chesterman.“The seldom discussed Scottish Third Division deserves a mention,” pleads Cam McGlone. “On 15 December 2012 Queen’s Park played host to Elgin City, attracting 466 hardy souls to Hampden Park for a 1-1 draw. Their following home game was against Rangers on 29 December and attracted a crowd of 30,117 – a difference of 29,651. That should be hard to beat without a team changing stadiums or playing behind closed doors.” A footnote: in the 1-1 draw with Elgin, watched by those 466 people, Queen’s Park’s goal was scored by a teenager called Andrew Robertson. Yep. “When in my student days I started attending Queen’s Park games, we had a star winger named James Allan,” wrote Matthew Reid in 2011. “I often wondered what happened to him, until he re-emerged as lead singer of Glasvegas. When they supported U2 at Hampden in August 2009, he notched up the rare feat of having performed at the same stadium both musically and footballistically. Is this a unique achievement or has anyone else managed it? Did Andrew Cole ever unleash Outstanding on Wembley?” It seems Knowledge reader Neil Wright has beaten Cole and co to it. “I’m not sure about any professional players, but I have achieved playing football and music in the same stadium myself!” chirrups Neil. “In May 2003 I played in the Southend & District Junior Sunday League Cup final (Under-15s) at Southend United’s Roots Hall. A few years later I returned to the stadium to play guitar in the live band during a Renewal of Promise service for the local Scout districts.” So, er, now you know. “Phil Foden got another assist for England in Ivory Coast, his sixth or seventh in 15 caps depending on which source you believe. But who has the most assists for England?” asks Matty Ellis. “If Luton Town finish higher than 12th in the Championship, which looks increasingly likely, it will be the seventh consecutive year they have improved their league position. Would that be a record?” asks Bogdan Kotarlic. “The Costa Rican player Yeltsin Tejeda is named after the former Russian president. Are there any other footballers named after politicians? Perhaps a Tony Blair or a Ronald Reagan plying their trade in Serie B …” muses Peter Strang. “Ivory Coast’s Serge Aurier was sent off against England last week in the 40th minute. Red cards in international friendlies are rare, and in the first half even more so – but what is the fastest red card ever given in an international friendly?” asks Joe Scott.

4/6/2022,"Paul Keating and Noel Pearson have said that if Labor wins government, it must not postpone a referendum on a voice to parliament, lest it repeat the mistakes of the past and betray its base of loyal Aboriginal voters. In a wide-ranging conversation in Sydney on Wednesday, the Indigenous leader and the former prime minister discussed a voice to parliament, constitutional recognition and treaty-making. Keating said Labor should be “on the front foot” on negotiating a treaty with Indigenous people, and noted that the point of the voice to parliament was to “provide a measure of empowerment” that had been lacking since the abolition of ATSIC under the Howard government. “The centrality of these ideas feed the truth of the [Labor] party’s existence, feeds its soul. Otherwise you live a lie,” Keating said. “I tried in the Redfern speech to articulate the lie, but we shouldn’t be living the lie … we’re still living the lie.” Pearson said constitutional recognition was necessary first, and warned Labor not to postpone a referendum until a second term of office. Pearson, one of the key architects of the Uluru statement from the heart and director of the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership, said there has not been a public policy issue as “protracted” as the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Islander people, noting that in the 14 years since the commitment to recognition was made at the 2007 election, there have been four parliamentary processes and three public inquiries, but no real progress. “[John] Howard went into the 2007 election with that commitment. Kevin Rudd immediately said he would do the same. And the unfortunate thing was, when it was clear that Rudd was going to prevail at the election, he said we will deal with this in the second term. He never got a second term. “And I fear that the opposition now is in danger of repeating the same mistake, deferring the question of putting recognition to the Australian people in a referendum to a second term and we’ll repeat the mistake of 2007, 2008.” Pearson said he had come to terms with “the bitter truth” that “17 long years of a failed experiment in my strategy of reaching out to the political leadership of the right had availed us of nothing in the end”. He hoped that Labor would hold a referendum in its first term, but said Aboriginal people had been let down in the past. “There’s probably no other group in Australia that more faithfully votes for Labor than Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, yet the Labor party’s respect for that base is often found wanting and they would abandon us – they have abandoned us in the past, like Bob [Hawke] did with national land rights in the 1980s – at the drop of a hat,” Pearson said. “The constitutional recognition of a voice would not prevent the parliament from reshaping and redesigning the voice and amending its provisions. But it will always maintain an obligation on the part of the parliament to have a voice. And that’s why the voice is so important.” Keating and Pearson were in conversation at the Judith Neilson Institute for journalism and ideas on Wednesday, to launch Pearson’s collection of essays, Mission. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Keating recalled that in 1998, Labor had offered Pearson the seat of Lawler, saying he felt at the time that Pearson had all the qualities of a future prime minister. “I’d said to many people that in the primary requirements of leadership, particularly of an organisation such as the Labor party, in the years after I immediately left, I believed you were the most qualified person to basically lead the country,” he said to Pearson. But Pearson said he didn’t have the “self-belief” at the time to consider it was “a serious idea”. In the book he writes: “I should have tried the political path to power inside the tent, but I hesitated. I did not possess the vantage of self-belief to see its viability. I only see it now in hindsight.”",News/Australia news,"Labor must not betray Indigenous voters by delaying voice to parliament, Keating and Pearson say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/labor-must-not-betray-indigenous-voters-by-delaying-voice-to-parliament-keating-and-pearson-say
4/6/2022,"Douglas Stuart’s second novel appears hard on the heels of 2020’s Shuggie Bain, a Booker prize winner with strong claims to instant-classic status, and is similar in a number of ways. Mungo Hamilton, like Shuggie, is born in the late 1970s and grows up in a tenement in Glasgow, a crabbed but oddly magical locale, with an older sister (Jodie), an older brother (Hamish) and an erratic “alkahawlick” mother to whom he is devoted (Mo-Maw). Again Stuart proves himself a wonderfully gifted writer, a virtuoso describer with a more or less infinite supply of tender detail and elegant phrasing. But Young Mungo, though immersive and rarely dull, emerges as a chaotic cousin to its straight‑shooting predecessor, and offers an altogether bumpier experience. The key event is Mungo’s encounter during the winter half-term break with James Jamieson, a slightly older Catholic boy who keeps a dovecote near the grounds of the housing scheme where they live. Mungo and James fall in love and plan to escape as soon as Mungo turns 16, but their bond is doubly star-crossed. Mungo cannot tell which would be considered the worse betrayal in the eyes of his fearsome brother Hamish – that James is male or that he’s “Fenian”. The backdrop is 1993, with sections titled “The May After” and “The January Before”. The first trajectory lasts a matter of days, during which Mungo takes a trip to the banks of Loch Lomond with a pair of men, even more unsavoury than they first appear, who are known to Mo-Maw from her occasional attendance at AA. But the other timeline moves briskly forward, so that Mungo’s meeting with Jamie takes place in the second chapter of the section entitled “The January Before”. Stuart is a lucid storyteller, moving between the narratives with ease, but the novel is characterised by overkill and we are never trusted to get the message. Almost every paragraph seems to contain a redundancy – an extra bit of scene setting, or the near synonymous rephrasing of a well-established conceit. At one point, when Mungo is waiting for the “proverbial penny to drop” in a conversation with Hamish, there’s a 118-word description of a slot machine at “Mo-Maw’s favourite bingo” which creates a similar – albeit literal – coin-induced sense of anticipation. Though Stuart is capable of economical effects, he elects to remind the reader of central dynamics and traits: “She wondered what lay ahead for her baby brother.” “Something in him could not stand to be loved.” “So, what was it about Catholics that made them so different?” As late as page 280, there is a description of Mungo’s relationship to Mo-Maw in the form of a 12-item list: confidant, lady’s maid, errand boy, flattering mirror, teenage diary, electric blanket, doormat, best pal and so on. Barely 10 pages from the end, Mungo encounters a stranger who tells him about his “artistic” son. He even wonders why he is hearing “about this one particular son out of the four sons he said he had”. The obvious conclusion is that the man intuits Mungo’s sexuality, but the scene occurs long after its undertones have been exhaustively established. The Hamiltons’ neighbours also pop up to share the burden. The local bachelor Poor-Wee-Chickie reminisces about a scenario almost identical to that between Mungo and Jamie: “I just didnae have the guts.” In third-person novels, a great deal rides on formulations that present thought and speech without accompanying quotation marks. But again and again, Stuart tries to smuggle in supplementary insight or information. Mo-Maw, who at one point calls her daughter a “talking bicyclopedia”, tells Mungo that “the scrap merchant and his wife were good people, phlegmatic but harmless”. Jodie gives Mungo an Ellsworth Kelly catalogue and he flicks through, and appears to note the “supremely controlled line drawings”, the rectangles that “collided to make patterns and depth of tone from their layered repetition”. A chapter in which Jodie and Mungo interrupt an act of domestic violence in the downstairs flat is symptomatic of Stuart’s slightly scattershot approach. It moves between perspectives, putting us in the head of the abused woman (“Even as he was battering her, she worried about his good name”) and then of Mungo (“He wanted to put his fingers in his ears”) before segueing into a neutral report of the Old Firm Derby: “Collins’s goal in the first half was followed by another from Payton, putting Celtic firmly in the lead. Rangers brought on their golden boy, McCoist, but they struggled to get back into the game.” Such details are relevant because, we are told from an apparently omniscient viewpoint, the violent husband has been angered by Rangers’ defeat. But then this turns out not to be the case, and so the match is irrelevant; the point of the scene is really to plant another thematic signpost. The woman excuses her husband’s appalling conduct because she loves him – much like the Hamilton siblings with Mo-Maw (“If anybody should understand ... then it’s you two”). Yet despite the multifarious frustrations, and even at its most overexplicit and overwrought, Young Mungo is the work of a true novelist. Bizarre technique cannot crowd out the energy of Stuart’s characters or the organic force of his teeming world. At times he recalls Dostoevsky, in whose work the powerful exists alongside the galumphing. Mungo’s predicament is piercing, and as the story draws to a close, a spectral beauty prevails.
