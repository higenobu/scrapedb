Why was an exotic spotted cat roaming the Miami streets? He’s famous in his own way “When they looked under the car they found a small scaredy cat that was too petrified to come out,” said the sheriff’s office in a statement. “Our fleet manager came to the rescue and at a speed that could rival a NASCAR pit crew got the tire off safely and pulled the calico out.” A spokesperson for the PCSO said the car had been in motion before the kitten, a calico — and most likely female — was discovered. “There’s no way to tell if he/she was in another part underneath and when they stopped that was where he/she hid,” said the police statement provided to the Miami Herald Monday. “The car was at Publix and where they stopped was several miles from the store.” The kitten, nicknamed “Trooper,” was brought to the local animal control, which confirmed receipt of the calico.",U.S./Miami Herald,A driver heard a ‘weird noise’ in the car — then Florida cops found it.

4/12/2022,"Russia was set to host the Men's Volleyball World Championship later this year. However, following the country's invasion of Ukraine, it was stripped of the right to do so. Now, the Russian Volleyball Federation wants $80 million in compensation. UPDATE: The CAS told Insider that it is yet to receive any appeal from Russia. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has shut down claims that Russia is formally seeking $80 million in compensation after being stripped of the right to host the Volleyball Men's World Championship later this year. Russia was scheduled to stage the tournament in August and September, with 10 cities including capital Moscow chosen to host matches. However, the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) announced last month that the event would no longer go ahead in Russia, in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Volleyball Federation (VFR) said last week that it was challenging the decision, with the organization's secretary general Alexander Yaremenko saying that it has filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to try to secure a reimbursement for the loss of the tournament. ""We submitted documents to CAS. We have collected all expenses, participation fee, preparation costs, including regional expenses, construction projects,"" Yaremenko said Wednesday, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti. ""The amount of compensation is almost $80 million."" The CAS, however, told Insider on Monday that Yaremenko's claim is not true. ""At the time of writing, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has not registered any procedures relating to the Volleyball Mens World Championship,"" a statement from CAS said. The FIVB also told Inside the Games that it had yet to receive any communication regarding the VFR's reported appeal to the CAS. ""The FIVB has not received information on this through any official channel and is therefore not in a position to comment on the accuracy of this story or specific statements that the VFR allegedly plans on raising a claim against the FIVB,"" it said. ""At this stage, we have no further comment on the matter."" Russia was largely frozen out by the rest the sporting world following its invasion of Ukraine in late February. Russia and Belarus — which has acted as a staging ground for the invasion — were both banned from competing in international events by the governing bodies of myriad sports, including soccer, tennis, swimming, rugby, boxing, judo, and Formula One. World Athletics indefinitely banned ""all athletes, support personnel and officials"" from Russia and Belarus from participating in any of its competitions, while the two nations were also ejected from the 2022 Beijing Paralympic Winter Games. Since, many of the governing bodies in Russia, including those in biathlon, football, gymnastics, rugby union, and now volleyball, have filed appeals against the sanctions to the CAS. None of the appeals submitted so far have been successful.

4/12/2022,"Gen Z and millennials are unique when it comes to demanding a work-life balance. They don’t just want flexible work hours and environments, they want to work for companies that align with their own personal beliefs and values. And almost half of Gen Z and millennials would rather be unemployed than unhappy in a job, according to a new study. A majority of them put their personal happiness over work. The Workmonitor global study was conducted by multinational human resource consulting firm Randstad. Randstad surveyed 35,000 workers across 34 markets. The career goals of Gen Z and millennials are changing power dynamics in the workplace. “Our findings should serve as a wake-up call for employers. There’s a clear power shift underway as people rethink priorities,” Sander van ‘t Noordende, global CEO of Randstad, said in a statement. Almost two in four members of younger generations would prefer being unemployed than work in a job they don’t like, the study found. Most of the young people surveyed said they preferred to work at companies that shared their personal values. Two in five Gen Zers and millennials said they’d take a lower-paying salary if it meant they were purposefully contributing to society. Diversity and inclusion were also important to the survey respondents: 49 percent of Gen Z and 46 percent of millennials said they wouldn’t work for a company that didn’t make diversity a priority. A priority of Gen Z and millennials is their own happiness. In fact, 56 percent of Gen Z and 55 percent of millennials said they would quit a job if it interfered with their personal lives. The study’s finding could offer an explanation as to why employers are finding it difficult to attract younger talent for job openings. Randstad concluded that if employers don’t start tailoring the positions to fit the demands of Gen Zers and millennials, they could face an employee shortage. Some 32 percent of Gen Z and 28 percent of millennials are on the hunt for new jobs — as long as they meet their requirements. “Young people want to bring their whole selves to work, which is reflected in their determination not to compromise their personal values when choosing an employer,” Noordende said. “Businesses need to rethink their approach to attracting and retaining staff or face serious competition.” Read full story at Finurah here.",Business/Atlanta Black Star,Gen Z and Millennials are Disrupting the Workplace As They’re Choosing to be Jobless Rather Than Work for a Company They Don’t Like,https://news.yahoo.com/gen-z-millennials-disrupting-workplace-163300584.html
