1/18/2022,"The House of Lords commissioner for standards has launched an investigation into the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, relating to the PPE company awarded £203m government contracts via the “VIP lane” after she referred it to the Cabinet Office in May 2020. The investigation follows a complaint by the Labour peer George Foulkes on 6 January, after the Guardian reported that leaked files appear to suggest Lady Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in the company, PPE Medpro.  Foulkes asked the commissioners to investigate whether Mone may have breached the Lords code of conduct by failing to declare an interest in the company, and by lobbying for it to be awarded government contracts. The commissioner confirmed that the investigation will look into possible breaches by Mone under three provisions of the Lords code, which cover the requirement that peers publicly register “all relevant interests”, and prohibit them from lobbying for a company or a person in which a peer “has a financial interest”. Mone, appointed a Conservative peer by David Cameron in 2015 after selling an 80% stake in her Ultimo lingerie company, has consistently denied any “role or function” in the company, and her lawyers have said she is “not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”. The possible sanctions for a peer found to have breached the code of conduct, which are determined by the conduct committee, range from merely having to correct a breach, to the most serious penalty of expulsion from the Lords. PPE Medpro was awarded an £80.85m contract in May 2020 to supply face masks, followed by a £122m contract in June 2020 to supply 25m surgical gowns. Barrowman has also denied being an investor, and his lawyers have said he “was not personally involved in working for PPEM in relation to PPE contracts”. In December 2020 lawyers for Barrowman and the company also told the Guardian that: “Neither [Barrowman] nor anybody involved with PPEM approached any MPs, peers, government officials, ministers, NHS staff or other health professionals as part of making the approach to the government to offer to supply PPE.” The sole registered owner of the UK-registered company is Anthony Page, who works for Barrowman’s family office at his Isle of Man financial services firm Knox Group. In November 2021, following a freedom of information request pursued by the Good Law Project, the government disclosed that Mone had originally referred PPE Medpro to the Cabinet Office, contacting the office of minister Theodore Agnew, her fellow Conservative peer who was responsible for procurement during the Covid pandemic. More recently the government confirmed that Mone made that referral on 7 May 2020, five days before PPE Medpro was even incorporated. The Guardian reported on 6 January that leaked files appear to suggest both Mone and Barrowman were involved in the business of PPE Medpro. One person closely involved in PPE Medpro claimed Barrowman was “part of the financial consortium that backed” the company and was even involved in initial conversations with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The leaked files appear to suggest that the UK company is effectively a subsidiary of another company named PPE Medpro Ltd, registered in the Isle of Man a day earlier. Barrowman appeared to have been personally involved in setting up agreements for the Isle of Man company with a London importing company, Loudwater Trade and Finance, which would source and supply the PPE. In one of the agreements, PPE Medpro (Isle of Man) stated that it would use its “extensive network to seek to secure rolling forward order contracts with the NHS and other government bodies within the British Isles”. From the two contracts, to supply millions of face masks and surgical gowns, the Guardian understands that PPE Medpro may have made in excess of £40m gross profits. The company declined to say whether that figure was accurate. Mone’s representatives have said she had no interest in PPE Medpro, and denied any wrongdoing. “The reason why no interest in PPE Medpro appears in Baroness Mone’s register of interests is because no such interest exists,” her lawyer said in December 2020. Barrowman’s lawyers have said the Guardian’s reporting amounted to “clutching at straws” and was “largely incorrect”. Mone’s lawyers said the Guardian’s reporting was “grounded entirely on supposition and speculation and not based on accuracy”, adding: “She is under no obligation to say anything to you.” Mone’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment about the commissioner’s investigation. Foulkes told the Guardian: “I welcome the decision of the commissioner to investigate what appears to be breaches of the code of conduct by Baroness Mone under three provisions dealing with failure to register interests and paid lobbying.”",News/Politics,Lords standards commissioner launches inquiry into Michelle Mone,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/lords-standards-commissioner-launches-inquiry-into-michelle-mone
1/18/2022,"Credit Suisse needed someone to lead a clean-up job, and António Horta-Osório had impeccable credentials for struggling banks. During the financial crisis at Spanish bank Santander he had led the takeover of Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley when they were near collapse, and then helped pull Lloyds Bank out of the mire after its government bailout. He was not known to object to this shining-armour reputation, displaying in his office a cartoon showing a knight on horseback rescuing two banking damsels in distress.  Yet his latest adventure has ended suddenly, after an internal Credit Suisse investigation found breaches of Covid regulations. They included admitted contravention of Swiss isolation rules. He also watched Novak Djokovic win the Wimbledon men’s final when he allegedly should have been in quarantine according to UK laws. Horta-Osório resigned over the weekend once the findings were made clear to him. Horta-Osório was born in Lisbon in January 1964, attending Jesuit school and acquiring a love of tennis, before studying management and business administration at the Portuguese capital’s Universidade Católica Portuguesa. He started on his banking career in 1987 at Citibank Portugal, where he rose to become head of capital markets by 1991, while also completing an MBA at France’s prestigious Insead in the same year. From there he joined US investment bank Goldman Sachs, before Spain’s Santander took him on as a chief executive of a Portuguese subsidiary in 1993. In 2006 he made the move to the UK to head up Abbey National, the former building society bought by Santander two years earlier. During four years in charge he steered the bank through acquisitions which built up a formidable high street presence, and a rebrand, not to mention the financial crisis. By June 2009 his reputation was such that he was appointed as a non-executive director to the Court of the Bank of England, but he quickly gave up that role when former chancellor George Osborne picked him to lead Lloyds Banking Group. Over the course of almost a decade Horta-Osório led Britain’s biggest high street bank past near-collapse during 2011 to leaving state ownership in 2017, and went through a big round of technology investment in response to the threat of digital startups, but also cut hundreds of branches and tens of thousands of jobs. He also collected £60m in pay. He oversaw the unprecedented £22bn in compensation payouts by Lloyds to people miss-sold payment protection insurance. Horta-Osório’s affection for the UK became clear when he became a British citizen, a move that made him eligible for the knighthood (although he also sampled the other side of being a British public figure when a Sun newspaper front page splashed an affair in 2016 with the headline “Lloyds bonk”). The royal honour was bestowed for services to “financial services, mental health and culture”, reflecting his work as chair of the Wallace Collection of art and antiquities as well as his ground-breaking openness about mental health struggles in an industry known for a sometimes punishingly macho culture. At Credit Suisse he was brought in to turn the page on a series of governance scandals, overseeing the launch of a new strategy in November. His abrupt departure means he is unlikely to leave much of a mark on the bank.",News/Business,António Horta-Osório: banking’s go-to man felled by a breach of Covid rules,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/antonio-horta-osorio-bankings-go-to-man-felled-by-a-breach-of-covid-rules
1/18/2022,"When the former Downing Street pollster James Johnson ran a focus group on “partygate” in the red wall seat of Bolton North East, the feedback wasn’t exactly encouraging for No 10. Some of the disparaging comments from those voters who backed the Tories for the first time in 2019 included: “I think he’s completely lost everyone’s trust”, “he needs to resign” and “I don’t really see how he can carry on”. When people were asked whether they would vote for Boris Johnson now, not a single person put their hand up.  That reaction won’t come as much of a surprise to Tory MPs in Westminster after a weekend in their constituencies. While the prime minister and his team have tried to win over the parliamentary party with regular trips to the tearoom and “Operation Red Meat”, which aims to please the base with rightwing policies, the charm offensive is yet to work on the grassroots. “It’s bleak,” says one loyalist MP. The problem is it is not the usual suspects. Instead, “it’s our core base”, according to someone on the government payroll. New revelations on Friday that No 10 staff were partying on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral have driven many MPs to distraction. As one points out, members of their associations often belong to other community organisations and take an extremely dim view of lax attitudes to the rules. “There is something almost impressive about managing to piss off absolutely every group of society,” observes a former adviser. In the face of criticism from even usually supportive newspapers, MPs are discovering new coping mechanisms. One senior Tory had a media blackout at the weekend – the complaints from his constituents were enough. Yet for all the anger, it’s still unclear how Johnson would actually go. MPs fall roughly into two camps: those who want him out before the local elections and those who think he ought to be given until then to turn things around. The group most eager to see the back of the prime minister is made up of those who have council seats up for grabs in May. Candidates are talking of dropping out and are warning of electoral oblivion. In order to avoid this fate, they argue that a new leader is required at the national level. They are backed by longtime Johnson critics, Scottish Tories and increasingly MPs in Liberal Democrat/Tory marginals. Given the Liberal Democrats managed to overturn chunky Conservative majorities in the Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire byelections, this group don’t feel as though they need to wait until May. However, many MPs believe Johnson will cling on until then – bar no new damaging disclosures. First, the next Tory leadership contest will not be a tidy affair; there is no unity candidate. The two frontrunners, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, have their supporters – but also ample critics. Already a “Stop Truss” contingent is forming – MPs keen to either keep Johnson in place to avoid this fate or to work to stop the foreign secretary reaching the membership in any contest. Given she is a grassroots favourite, they view it as too risky to have her in the final two. With potential candidates being tipped to run including the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, former defence minister Penny Mordaunt, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, the contest is already looking rather crowded. “To get to 54 letters and then start and complete a leadership contest between now and April is overly ambitious,” says a member of government. There are also self-serving reasons ministers are keen to put off a contest. The mantra “he who wields the knife never wears the crown” is weighing heavily on contenders. Such a move could lead to a backlash among Johnson loyalists and make an entry in a leadership contest more difficult. “A lot of colleagues want him to take us into the local elections and let the public vote on him,” says someone on the payroll. “It’s a neater way of doing things.” Another MP argues that those activists who support Johnson need to see proof that he is no longer an electoral asset. But that calculation could change. While the fact there is no obvious successor is helping Johnson stay in position, things could get so bad that MPs ultimately decide it’s best to get rid of the problem then work on the solution afterwards. While Downing Street aides are optimistic he will survive Sue Gray’s report, MPs will be carefully studying his reaction. Johnson’s falling poll ratings suggest many voters have already made up their minds – any more denying reality or making excuses will feed into the very complaints that were raised in that Bolton focus group. The issue for the prime minister is that the partygate crisis is not yet a Conservative-wide scandal, it’s a Boris Johnson scandal. If MPs conclude they need to move fast in order to stop it contaminating the whole Tory brand permanently, he will be out sooner rather than later – even if the question of who will succeed him remains up in the air.

1/18/2022,"Downing Street has said Boris and Carrie Johnson followed Covid guidance when the prime minister was “commuting” from Chequers to No 10 during the first lockdown in 2020 – but declined to answer further questions, including whether the pair held social events. It emerged last week that the prime minister and his then-fiancee travelled between No 10 and the spacious Buckinghamshire mansion between 16 and 27 March 2020, around the start of the first lockdown.  On 16 March, the government advised the public to avoid all non-essential travel, and on 22 March, three days before a full lockdown was ordered, specified that essential travel “does not include visits to second homes”. However, the Tortoise website reported that Johnson and his partner relocated to Chequers during this period, after which the prime minister continued to travel to Downing Street from Chequers to work for several days. Johnson’s official spokesperson insisted on Monday that they had not broken the rules, saying they “acted in accordance with both the guidance and subsequent legislation at all times”. “At the time as you know, Mrs Johnson was heavily pregnant, in a vulnerable category, and advised to minimise social contacts. So in line with clinical guidance and to minimise the risk to her, they were based at Chequers during that period, with the prime minister commuting to Downing Street to work,” he said. He said their decision to move was because of the specific nature of No 10, which “unusually, is both a private residence and an office for hundreds of people.” The spokesperson pointed out that by the time the guidance against travelling to second homes came in on 22 March, “the prime minister and his wife were already based in Chequers, acting in line with clinical guidance”. He declined to answer further questions, however, including whether parties or social events were held at Chequers while the pair were there. It has been reported that Carrie Johnson hosted a baby shower for a group of friends on 14 March 2020. By that time a minister, Nadine Dorries, had been diagnosed with Covid. Johnson isolated alone in his Downing Street flat after testing positive for Covid on 27 March, eventually being taken into St Thomas’ hospital and spending time in intensive care. He then returned to Chequers to convalesce. Johnson’s compliance with the strict restrictions in place in the first lockdown has come under intense scrutiny in recent days, since he apologised for attending a “bring your own booze” gathering, telling MPs he believed it was a “work event”. Johnson appears poised to blame a “culture” of drinking in No 10 for a series of rule-breaking parties, including two held on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral. But the prime minister’s critics say he played a key role in encouraging lockdown-busting behaviour.",News/Politics,No 10 defends PM’s trips between London and Chequers in March 2020 ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/no-10-defends-pms-trips-between-london-and-chequers-in-march-2020
1/18/2022,"Campaigners have called for the end of the “scattered” approach to gender-based violence in Ireland after the murder of 23-year-old Ashling Murphy. Irish police are still hunting for the killer of the primary school teacher, who was strangled on a canal path near the town of Tullamore while out jogging on Wednesday afternoon.  The murder has convulsed the nation with an outpouring of anger and shock in Ireland and beyond, with tens of thousands of people attending vigils in Dublin, Cork, Belfast, London and New York over the weekend. Her funeral will take place on Tuesday. Schools around the country have been asked to observe a minute’s silence by the main teaching unions. There has been a chorus of calls for more action by the government and an end to “turf wars” between justice, children’s, health and other departments over who is responsible for which part of services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Over the weekend there were heartbreaking scenes as Ashling’s devastated parents, Kathleen and Raymond, her sister, Amy, brother, Cathal, and boyfriend, Ryan, joined a vigil near the location of the killing. The Garda Síochána are still waiting to speak to an individual who presented to a Dublin hospital with unexplained injuries, some of which were believed to be self-inflicted and serious. The minister for justice, Helen McEntee, said a new strategy to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be published by March, promising a “zero-tolerance” approach to violence against women. Mary McDermott, chief executive officer at Safe Ireland, which campaigns for women and children’s safety, said a joined-up approach was long overdue, with “goodwill” needed at the children’s and other departments as they needed to yield control of parts of their portfolio to deliver a centralised ministry. “Refuge and support services are under [the department of] children and the rest of the responsibility, which we know requires a whole-of-government response, is scattered across the rest of government departments.” While there have been repeated calls for centralisation since a government taskforce on the issues in 1997, McDermott said it was time for law makers to stop treating “domestic, sexual and gender based violence” as an “amorphous mass”. “Until we really sit down and stop all the blaming, name it accurately and bring it front and centre into government, with a ministerial responsibility and proper resources, we’re going nowhere,” she said. She said the problem needed to be treated as a matter of urgency and given the same weight as the climate crisis, with a “high level unit” to tackle the cross-departmental issues. The sensitivity of the issue of gender violence was highlighted over the weekend when one RTE presenter was warned in a text to her radio show to refrain from making remarks that could be construed as “anti-men”. McDermott said one of the “most debilitating” things about the campaign for the safety of women was the “false equivalence” that men were also victims of violence by women. On Sunday night, organisers of an online vigil said they would complain to Zoom after man a attempted to disrupt the event by exposing himself and appearing to masturbate on camera. According to the Irish Times, the organisers reported the incident to Zoom and requested information from the platform about the account used by the man.",News/World news,Calls for action on gender-based violence after Ashling Murphy killing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/calls-for-action-on-gender-based-violence-after-ashling-murphy-killing-ireland
1/18/2022,"Good news doesn’t get any more in-your-face than this. One thousand fin whales, one of the world’s biggest animals, were seen last week swimming in the same seas in which they were driven to near-extinction last century due to whaling. It’s like humans never happened. This vast assembly was spread over a five-mile-wide area between the South Orkney islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. A single whale is stupendous; imagine 1,000 of them, their misty forest of spouts, as tall as pine trees, the plosive sound of their blows, their hot breath condensing in the icy air. Their sharp dorsal fins and steel-grey bodies slide through the waves like a whale ballet, choreographed at the extreme south of our planet.  The sight has left whale scientists slack-jawed and frankly green-eyed in envy of Conor Ryan, who observed it from the polar cruiser, National Geographic Endurance. Messaging from the ship on a tricky connection, Ryan, an experienced zoologist and photographer, says this may be “one of the largest aggregations of fin whales ever documented”. His estimate of 1,000 animals is a conservative one, he says. We found about 1000 fin whales over a 5x5 mile area off South Orkney. Blue and humpback also mixed in. Mind completely blown 🐳 @LindbladExp #NationalGeographicEndurance pic.twitter.com/xtdvexXwI5 “We were about 15 miles north of Coronation Island,” Ryan reports, with “four large krill fishing vessels working the same area”. The vessels’ presence makes clear the reason for this party. The whales were feeding on a grand scale, sucking up tonnes of tiny shrimps. Fin whales are surprisingly slender, serpentine creatures when you see them underwater, and so long that they seem to take for ever to swim past. Like blue, humpback and minke whales, they’re baleen whales, distinguished by food-filtering keratinous plates in lieu of teeth. Unlike toothed whales, such as sperm whales and killer whales, they are not usually seen as social animals. In Moby-Dick Herman Melville classifies the fin whale as “not gregarious … very shy; always going solitary … the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race”. Factor in their tremendous size – at up to 27m long, only just short of the blue whale’s 33m – and you come close to appreciating the astonishing intensity of this eruption of marine life. So, is it really good news? In this same ocean, at least two million whales were slaughtered in the past century. Given that we now know fin whales can live for up to 140 years, the effects of that cull are still being felt in their culture. It may be that our assumption that fin whales aren’t “social” animals actually stems from the fact that they amended their behaviour to evade the whalers, as sperm whales did in the 19th century. Scientists suspect that baleen whales also learned not to gather in large groups to stay one step ahead of the hunters. Only now, perhaps, are they returning to old foraging grounds. Ryan delights in calling himself a “whale nerd”; he and his best friend, Peter Wilson, were just 14 years old when they published their first peer-reviewed scientific paper on killer whales in 2001. When he gets home from this trip, he’ll be writing another paper. Despite his 20 years’ experience at sea, Ryan has never seen anything like this. “Words fail me,” he says. “I have seen maybe 100 fins here before in previous years. Thousands of chinstrap penguins, petrels, and albatrosses, too … It was unusually calm weather,” he adds, “and unusually good visibility.” If Ryan considers himself blessed, then so should we. Whales still face many threats, mostly from us. And we would do well to remember that the protests that saved the whales in the 1970s and 80s will be outlawed if the new police and crime bill passes into law. In a world constrained by woe and threats to democracy (it’s a good job whales don’t have to apply for the right to assemble), 1,000 fin whales can’t help but lift our hearts. They might even convince us that, as another species of (supposedly) sentient mammal, we still stand a chance of getting through “all of this”. So long as we stick together and send up a few protest spouts of our own.

1/18/2022,"Woolworths has suspended supplies from a South Australia meatworks that was given state government approval to operate while some staff were Covid positive. Brad Banducci, chief executive of the supermarket giant, decided to halt taking product from the Teys Australia abattoir near Naracoorte after a telephone hook-up on Sunday with Michelle O’Neil, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.  Banducci, along with chief reputation officer Christian Bennett and senior human rights officer Laura McManus, sought to defuse a public row over the use of Covid-infected workers at the meatworks. The ACTU said the exemption from the SA government was apparently unique in Australia and set a dangerous precedent given the risks of affecting other staff. Teys operated for several days after at least 140 of its nearly 400 staff tested positive for Covid, before closing on Thursday. It resumed slaughtering cattle on Monday and its main de-boning and other meat processing will restart on Tuesday, an employee told Guardian Australia anonymously, because he was not authorised to comment publicly. The worker, though, said they believed that Woolworths’ decision to suspend taking meat from the Naracoorte site was “a very good thing” because in their opinion the company had not taken adequate care of the safety of the plant’s workforce of 385 people. “All of us are very worried,” the staffer said. In a statement sent to the Guardian over the weekend, a spokesperson for Teys said “the health and safety of Teys Australia’s people always comes first”, and the company was working hard to deal with the “constantly evolving challenges of the pandemic and resulting food security”. “In South Australia from [last] Monday, no team member on site will have tested positive within the last seven days,” the spokesperson said, adding that any staff in critical roles who tested positive were approved by SA Health to return to work if they didn’t have symptoms and had isolated for seven days. “Contrary to misleading claims made in the public domain, no worker has been, or will be, forced to work if they are unwell,” the official said. SA Health has been conducting the PCR testing of staff. Of those turning up to work on Monday, two of the 100-plus staff were positive, the Guardian has learned. More of the 385 employees are due to return to work on Tuesday, with those who have isolated for at least seven days after testing positive kept about 40 metres from other employees. However, the anonymous staffer said some people were returning to work without isolating, including at least one person who had tested positive only a day earlier, and some still had symptoms, including coughing and sore throats. Workers were also given little additional protection and used the same toilets, with Covid-positive staff identified by yellow hair nets worn over their white hard hats, he said. Some workers had become separated from their families, with partners of meatworkers avoiding their homes in order to reduce the risk of becoming infected, the staffer said. A Woolworths spokesperson said it had “suspended all supply through Teys’ South Australian facility while we work with Teys, SA Health and Safework SA to understand the protocols currently in place for their team and operations”. “We were not involved in the decision approved by SA Health to introduce exceptional temporary Covid measures at the site last week,” the spokesperson said. “We expect all of our suppliers to adhere to the Covid safety protocols set by their relevant state authorities.” Matt Journeaux, acting federal secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, alleged that Teys last week “forced their workers to keep turning up for work even though they were infected with Covid” – something the company denies. “This week, Teys is refusing to even talk to its workforce,” Journeaux said. “Workers are scared and they are worried about being forced to return to work in dangerous conditions.” The company said only about 5-8% of its staff were unionised and that SA Health, primary industry, WorkSafe and the police were overseeing its handling of the operations. Teys remains hopeful of winning back Woolworths’ business, which involves processing cattle supplied by the supermarket chain, “once the storm blows over”.",News/Australia news,Woolworths suspends orders from South Australia meatworks allowed to operate with Covid-infected staff,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/woolworths-suspends-orders-from-south-australia-meatworks-allowed-to-operate-with-covid-infected-staff
1/18/2022,"A man who was forced to hand over his phone and passcode to Australian Border Force after returning to Melbourne from holiday has labelled the tactic “an absolute gross violation of privacy”, as tech advocates call for transparency and stronger privacy protections for people’s devices as they enter the country. Software developer James and his partner returned from a 10-day holiday in Fiji earlier this month and were stopped by border force officials at Melbourne airport. They were taken aside, and after emptying their suitcases, an official asked them to write their phone passcodes on a piece of paper, before taking their phones into another room.  It was half an hour before their phones were returned, and they were allowed to leave. James initially posted about his ordeal on Reddit. “We weren’t informed why they wanted to look at the phones. We were told nothing,” he told Guardian Australia. “Who knows what they’re taking out of it? With your phone and your passcode they have everything, access to your entire email history, saved passwords, banking, Medicare, myGov. There’s just so much scope.” James said he has no idea what officials looked at, whether a copy of any of the data was made, where it would be stored and who would have access to it. “It’s an absolute gross violation of privacy.” Under the Customs Act, ABF officers can force people to hand over their passcodes to allow a phone search, as part of their powers to examine people’s belongings at the border, including documents and photos on mobile phones. A spokesperson for ABF did not respond to specific questions about James’ case, nor questions on how often the power is used or where the data is stored. The spokesperson said people can be questioned and their phone searched “if they suspect the person may be of interest for immigration, customs, biosecurity, health, law-enforcement or national security reasons”. “The ABF exercises these powers in order to protect the Australian community from harm and deliver upon its mission to protect Australia’s border and enable legitimate travel and trade. Information seized from passengers phones has contributed to the success of many domestic law enforcement operations targeting illegal activities,” the spokesperson said. “If an individual refuses to comply with a request for an examination of their electronic device, they may be referred for further law enforcement action.” Within Australia’s borders, there are more hurdles for law enforcement to access devices, including needing a warrant before people can be compelled to unlock their phones. In 2016, Nine newspapers reported a man sued ABF after text messages were sent and then deleted from his phone by an official while they had possession of his phone at the border in 2014. A freedom of information request in 2016 revealed the department had apologised to the man in 2015, and had determined the counter-terrorism unit officer breached ABF’s code of conduct. Electronic Frontiers Australia chair Justin Warren said it is impossible to determine how common such searches of phones are because the department doesn’t release any data on it – unlike data on warrants obtained under other domestic surveillance laws. “There is no transparency, and the authorities prefer it that way. Anecdotally, it seems to happen quite a lot,” Warren said, adding it showed the need for stronger privacy rights in Australia. “This is just another example of how few rights Australians actually have. We need a Bill of Rights in Australia to prevent abuses like this, and real consequences for abuse when it happens.” Samantha Floreani, program lead at Digital Rights Watch, agreed. “This is a prime example of the kind of privacy violations that can occur when you don’t have fundamental human rights,” she said. “A federal charter of human rights is long overdue in Australia. “It is completely unreasonable that people should be subject to such an invasion of privacy without so much as an explanation.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Warren advised people flying into Australia not to have anything on their device that they don’t want authorities accessing, and to ensure their device is encrypted with a strong passcode. “Once they take your device out of your sight, you should assume it’s completely compromised and they have a copy of everything that was on it, and act accordingly,” he said. Warren stressed that people in such a situation should also seek legal advice. James said the incident made him rethink what he would do next time he travels out of Australia. “I think what I’ll just do next time is as we fly into Sydney, I’ll just press the factory reset button on the phone and when they pull me up again, I’ll be handing them a fresh clean factory reset.”",News/World news,Returning travellers made to hand over phones and passcodes to Australian Border Force,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/returning-travellers-made-to-hand-over-phones-and-passcodes-to-australian-border-force
1/18/2022,"More than 830,000, or around one in nine, Australian women suffer from endometriosis, a condition that can cause debilitating pain during the menstrual cycle as well as during ovulation, sex, urination and bowel movements. Other symptoms include inflammation, bloating, heavy bleeding and fatigue, and it can affect fertility. The pain and discomfort can lead women to restrict exercise but this can create other chronic health problems, says accredited exercise physiologist Dr Angela Spence from Curtin University. Physical activity can also have myriad benefits.  “Regular exercise is associated with reduced risk of developing endometriosis,” she explains, and can also directly help reduce the inflammation associated with the condition. Other potential benefits include pain management, improved mental health and mitigation of side effects from commonly prescribed medications. Spence notes that more research is needed to give conclusive support for the role of exercise in managing endometriosis. But considering the benefits, experts have several general recommendations – with some provisos. “Women should be encouraged to be active and maintain routine activity,” says Spence, “but this should be progressed gradually as tolerance improves, ideally under the direction of an exercise specialist.” A progressive muscle relaxation technique called the Jacobsen method has been found to improve quality of life and reduce anxiety and depression in women with endometriosis, reports Emma Wise, a pelvic health physiotherapist. “This involves contracting and relaxing the major muscles of the body, one by one, as a form of mental and physical relaxation,” she explains. “It can be done easily at home in 30 to 40 minutes.” Start by relaxing and contracting the right hand, forearm, upper arm, and then left side, in that order. Move to the face, neck, chest, shoulder and upper back, and then the stomach, right thigh, calf and foot, followed by the left thigh, calf and foot. A specific focus on pelvic floor muscle training can improve range and relaxation of those muscles and help with pain associated with endometriosis, says Wise, adding that a specialised physiotherapist can help with this. “It is common for people with pelvic pain, including endometriosis, to have decreased tone of their pelvic floor muscles,” she explains. “This can further contribute to pelvic pain and other symptoms such as bladder and bowel issues [and] pain with sex.” For strengthening the pelvic floor and glutes, accredited exercise physiologist Brittany Cogger recommends clams or lying leg raises, sit to stands and glute bridging with resistance band. Pilates or yoga classes can help to release muscles that are tensed against the pain, writes Cogger. Indeed, Wise notes that women with endometriosis who took part in a study exploring Hatha-style yoga found improved quality of life and pain relief. This involved movements focussing on relaxation, breathing and posture exercises performed twice a week for eight weeks. Exercises based on Pilates and yoga principles can help release tensed muscles, according to Cogger, as well as stretches including seated glute stretch, seated hip flexor stretch and a wall side-bend stretch. She explains that lengthening and strengthening the pelvic floor, abdominal wall and hip flexor muscles are important for relaxing them before embarking on exercise. In this regard, Spence recommends walking or any other type of low-impact aerobic exercise that you enjoy, such as swimming or bike riding. Vigorous activity can worsen symptoms and result in flare-ups for some women and exacerbate cramping and fatigue, advises Wise. Specifically, it might be prudent to avoid high-impact exercises such as running and burpees, according to Cogger, as well as sit-ups and crunches.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: with endometriosis ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/18/how-to-move-with-endometriosis
1/18/2022,"Australian writer and democracy activist Dr Yang Hengjun’s health is failing as he approaches three years imprisoned in China, say friends who fear he may not survive his incarceration. Wednesday is the third anniversary of Yang’s arrest at Guangzhou airport on allegations of espionage on behalf of an unnamed foreign country. He maintains his innocence.  “Sometimes I’m pessimistic and sometimes I’m optimistic,” he said in a dictated statement from prison, made before he was blindfolded and led back to his cell. “I’m confident I didn’t do what they said I did. I know this, my lawyer knows this, and I think the judge knows this. According to Chinese law, I’m not guilty. But they treat me like dirt here and they tortured me.” Despite hundreds of interrogations, and, in his words, “torture” at the hands of China’s ministry of state security, Yang says he has not confessed to anything alleged against him, a fact that appears to have further delayed his judgment and sentencing under China’s confession-based legal system. His sentencing is now due by 9 April. Yang, 54, faced a single-day trial in May, held in secret, after more than two years in detention. He spoke briefly in his own defence, telling the court he was “100% innocent” and submitted about 100 pages of evidence and testimony to support his case. Yang, and the Australian government, reject the allegations against him. Australia’s ambassador to China has said his imprisonment amounts to “arbitrary detention”. Yang’s family, friends, and supporters say they are extremely concerned about his deteriorating health and argue he must be released on bail for medical treatment and returned to Australia. However, there appears little chance of his release ahead of sentencing, which has been repeatedly delayed. China has consistently said Yang’s detention and trial had been conducted in accordance with the law and accused Australia of “gross interference” in its advocacy on behalf of Yang. “Chinese judicial authorities handle the case strictly in accordance with law and fully protect the lawful rights of the relevant person,” a spokesperson said ahead of the trial. “The Australian side should respect China’s judicial sovereignty and refrain from interfering in any form in Chinese judicial authorities’ lawful handling of the case.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In his latest message from prison, Yang said: “I want the Chinese government to open my case and publish it. To provide details to the world, the Australian government, and the country. We should apply to open the case, and you can see for yourself. “They said it’s about espionage. I hope it’s just about Chinese judicial corruption.” Yang has been prevented from sending letters to lawyers, family and friends, or receiving them. He has access to one state-run television channel and some pre-approved books. He lives and sleeps in a crowded room with no sunlight, lights on all night, a communal open toilet, a hard floor and little room to move around or stretch. Yang’s health has deteriorated seriously in prison. He has severe problems with gout, high uric acid, high blood pressure, impaired vision and dizzy spells. One recent account, from late in 2021, reported: “Ongoing fatigue meant he was only able to exercise for short periods. Further, because of his dizzy spells, he sometimes wasn’t able to walk and had to, at times, just stand in place during his one hour of activity outdoors”. Blood tests have shown rapidly rising levels of creatinine, raising his risk of kidney failure. Friends and family say his worsening health problems are not being adequately treated. “We are concerned Yang is being systematically deprived of proper medical treatment,” a close friend and supporter said. “We know he does not trust the medication administered to him and, unfortunately, he has no reason to. Yang must not be left to die through medical neglect and mistreatment, like so many other writers and artists and public intellectuals who are passionately committed to a better future for the Chinese people, such as [Nobel laureate] Liu Xiaobo.” Prof Chongyi Feng, Yang’s PhD supervisor, said Yang was previously healthy, “but he has deteriorated greatly, and he is not being properly treated”. “We are very worried about him.” The Australia director at Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said conditions in China’s detention facilities and prisons were poor, with only rudimentary health care. “We are very concerned that Yang’s detention has exacerbated his medical problems and that the treatment in prison is inadequate. The Chinese government should release him unconditionally immediately.” Pearson said there was a “long list of human rights defenders” who have died in Chinese custody or shortly after being released. “A prison sentence should not be a death sentence in China. The Australian government should be doing everything in their power to persuade the Chinese authorities to release Yang Hengjun, as well as Cheng Lei and others who are arbitrarily detained.” Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, said the federal government was concerned about numerous delays to the verdict following Yang’s trial. “Neither Dr Yang nor the Australian government have been provided with details as to the charges against him or of the investigation, reinforcing our view that this constitutes the arbitrary detention of an Australian citizen,” Payne said in a statement. “We therefore call for Dr Yang’s immediate release and his return to Australia.” Payne said the government would continue to advocate for Yang’s interests and wellbeing.“Australia is also extremely concerned about Dr Yang’s health. We call on Chinese authorities to meet their obligations to ensure that all necessary treatment for his physical and mental health is provided.” Yang, whose legal name is Yang Jun, was born in Hubei in central China. He was formerly a diplomat for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, and an agent for the secretive ministry of state security, before working in the private sector in Hong Kong and moving to Australia, then to the US, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University. A writer of spy novels, he has been a popular blogger, political commentator and agitator for democratic reforms in China for more than a decade. He describes himself as a “democracy peddler”. Yang, who became an Australian citizen in 2002, flew into Guangzhou with his family in January 2019. His wife and child were able to enter China but authorities escorted Yang from the plane into detention. He has not been free since.",News/World news,‘They treat me like dirt and tortured me’: Australian activist on three years in Chinese prisons,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/they-treat-me-like-dirt-and-tortured-me-australian-activist-on-three-years-in-chinese-prisons
1/18/2022,"Sky News sought to justify misleading Covid commentary then-host Alan Jones put to air, saying it was balanced by coverage of the daily Covid press conferences, according to a letter sent to the broadcasting regulator. Prior to axing his show at the end of 2020, Sky News had long defended Jones’s Covid commentary, which contributed the removal of several videos from YouTube along with a week-long ban from the platform, and included a series of errors and apologies.  In July, Sky News removed from its website and corrected a broadcast of Jones’s show in which MP Craig Kelly wrongly claimed people who were vaccinated were more likely to die in the UK’s Delta wave than unvaccinated people. In August, the deputy chair and CEO of the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma), Creina Chapman, sent a letter to Sky News CEO, Paul Whittaker, which Guardian Australia obtained under freedom of information. In it, she noted that Sky News had taken steps to correct errors Jones had made in a timely fashion, but said more needed to be done. “Timely correction of errors is important. However, they do not stand instead of effective editorial control over programming before it goes to air where reasonable steps could have been taken to identify an error prior to broadcast,” she wrote. “Arguably, this is even more important at a time where accurate public health messaging is vital and where latter corrective action can create more confusion about the facts for audiences.” Chapman wrote that Acma was considering whether the commercial and broadcast codes of practice needed an overhaul, and that she needed reassurance from Whittaker about “measures Sky is taking to prevent recurrence of recent issues prior to broadcast”. In a response the following day, Whittaker noted Sky News had never been found in breach of the subscription and commercial TV codes of practice for over ten years and there was “no evidence” Sky News was breaching existing regulations or that the codes were failing. Whittaker pointed to the fact that since March 2020, Sky News had sought to cover every news conference of the prime minister, state premiers and chief ministers regarding Covid, either live or near to live. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It is not possible to give an exact number of hours of such coverage, although a conservative estimate would be at least two hours a day since the first lock down began in March 2020 and at least one hour per day Saturdays and Sundays. It should be noted on some days, [Australia News Channel] has covered up to five hours of news conferences live,” he said. He went on to list experts such as the Australian Medical Association, various epidemiologists, and top health officials who were interviewed on the channel, and said there were differing views in terms of the response to the outbreak, and the differences “are unquestionably subjects of public interest”. “There has been criticism and robust debate on these matters of public interest published widely, including on Sky News Australia,” he said. Jones was axed from the network a little over three months after the letter was sent. The documents obtained under freedom of information reveal that as of late last year Acma had received 42 Covid-related complaints about Sky News, with 19 regarding Jones, and seven of those related to the Alan Jones broadcast Sky News removed from its website and corrected. Most of these complaints were made after ABC’s Media Watch program aired a segment about the removal in July. The day after she wrote to Sky News, Chapman also wrote to Google seeking advice on the company’s misinformation policy and whether any of the videos it had removed from YouTube had also been broadcast on the Sky News’ TV channel. In response, Google’s head of government affairs and public policy in Australia, Lucinda Longcraft, confirmed 20 videos had been removed, but could not say whether the videos had first aired on Sky News. “We would not be able to speak to any alternative delivery channels used by YouTube partners, however we understand that Sky News’ most common practice is to upload videos on to YouTube that had been broadcast on their owned and operated broadcasting channels,” she said. The removed videos seen by Guardian Australia last year had all been clipped from Sky News’ broadcast. Jones has been on a break after launching his streaming show late last year.

1/18/2022,"The federal government has been accused of making a “disgraceful” attempt to cast secrecy over a case relating to Australia’s negotiations with Timor-Leste in the years prior to the controversial bugging operation revealed by Witness K and Bernard Collaery. Last year, independent senator Rex Patrick challenged a decision not to release archived cabinet documents setting out Australia’s strategy for bartering with its impoverished ally on the Timor Sea maritime boundary in the early 2000s.  The negotiations were crucial to Timor-Leste, because the resources in the Timor Sea could help lift it out of poverty, but it was later revealed Australia had bugged the offices of the fledgling nation’s government to gain an upper hand. Cabinet documents such as those sought by Patrick are typically made public after 20 years. But records about the Timor Sea negotiations have been withheld, initially because of the purported harm they could cause to relations with “the current government of a foreign country”. Patrick is fighting in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the unredacted release of the documents, seeking a cabinet submission outlining Australia’s negotiating strategy, dated 29 August 2000, and a related minute, dated 4 September 2000. But the government has indicated it will seek to have attorney-general Michaelia Cash use extraordinary powers to shroud at least part of the case in secrecy on the grounds that the information could harm relations with another country. Patrick told Guardian Australia the move was “disgraceful”. He said the damage to international relations had already been done by Australia’s spying on Timor-Leste, later revealed by former intelligence officer Witness K and his lawyer Collaery. “This is a shameful episode in Australian diplomacy in which the then Australian government spied and acted in bad faith in an attempt to steal the oil and gas resources of a newly independent and impoverished neighbour,” Patrick said. “Australia’s relations with Timor would now be much better served by a policy of transparency, acknowledgement of past wrongs and a genuine apology, not by more dubious legal manoeuvres to suppress the truth.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cash was approached for comment. The National Archives of Australia, which has responsibility for releasing old cabinet records, said it could not comment while the matter was before the tribunal. Patrick said the publication of the decades-old documents was no risk to Australia’s relations with Timor-Leste. “After all, the damage was done there by the Howard government’s spying activities and the current government’s persecution of Witness K and former Timor-Leste legal adviser Bernard Collaery,” he said. The cabinet papers are from one year after Timor-Leste’s 1999 independence referendum, but before its formal independence on 20 May 2002. Patrick, after asking for an internal review of the decision to withhold the documents, was given a heavily redacted version of the cabinet minute. All that can be surmised from the document is that a submission to cabinet about the Timor Sea negotiations was made. He is seeking full access to the document. The rationale for withholding the documents has shifted. After initially citing potential harm to international relations, the government now says the redacted content could cause “damage to the security, defence or international relations of the commonwealth” and that disclosure could be used by “organisations or individuals of national security interest to take counter measures against security operations”.

1/18/2022,"A general practitioner in Victoria responsible for triaging Covid-positive patients and referring them to appropriate health services has said Australia “must now have one of the worst Covid responses in the world” as clinics are overwhelmed. The doctor, who cannot be named due to fear of repercussions from his employer, said: “Australia has utterly squandered any gains we made during the pandemic … We are now seeing the sort of mess and chaos here that we saw in the UK at the start of Covid.”  The doctor’s role is to assess Covid-positive cases in the community and refer them to either community health services or GPs to support their care at home. In some cases he may assess they require an ambulance. He said those patients who required GP care and prescriptions struggled to get a GP appointment due to staff shortages and clinics being fully booked, and paramedics were often so under pressure they could not take patients he believed required hospital treatment. “There should be a dedicated pot of money given to assessment teams like mine so that we can just look after all the Covid patients ourselves, because while we have power to refer, we don’t have power to prescribe medications or administer care in their home,” he said. “This should be funded by federal and state governments, and adequately resourced to look after community care, because we desperately need to do something to take pressure off the GPs.” The managing director of SIA medical centres in Victoria, Grace Sia, said all eight of her GP clinics were overwhelmed and that this was taking a particular toll on admin staff. At one point, clinic receptionists were fielding an average of 400 calls an hour from the community, Sia said. Demand is being exacerbated by staff shortages with GPs, clinic nurses and receptionists in isolation due to Covid. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Our admin and reception staff are the ones who have to deal with everyone’s stressors, including from the doctors and the patients,” Sia said. “Patients will often be angry and abusive because their calls aren’t being answered or they can’t get an appointment. “And when the government announces a new policy, we find out at the same time as the patients do, so we have no time to prepare. Patients then call us to find out what’s going on, as we are still trying to work out the detail ourselves. Everyone is burned out from this.” The president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Karen Price, said GPs are under “enormous pressure” as Covid cases increased by the tens of thousands daily. “It is not business as usual,” she said. “Practices are having to triage care … some patients may need to wait to get an appointment. General practice is also facing workforce shortages, like many other sectors, as practice teams are being exposed to Covid-19 outside the workplace.” Price said she “cautiously welcomed” the government’s decision to allow asymptomatic close contacts who test negative to continue work to ease some of the staffing pressure on practices. “However, staff and patient safety must not be compromised,” she said. “We believe there needs to be flexibility for workers to make decisions they are comfortable with in terms of when they return to work, depending on their personal circumstances. And all such workers should undergo routine testing, wear PPE and comply with public health directives.” Dr Magdalena Simonis, a Melbourne GP, said at times her clinic was running with just 50% of its usual staff due to Covid. She said it was “unbelievable” that GP clinics did not have access to free rapid antigen tests for their staff and patients. “We’re not preventing unvaccinated people from entering the practice of course, because it defeats the purpose of having people come in for vaccination or to have the counselling around vaccination,” Simonis said. “So we’re seeing unvaccinated people and yet we do not have access to rapid antigen tests. It would help us if we were to screen patients who might have had contact and might be in a high risk situation, which might pose a risk to our staff, and ourselves as GPs. We’re in a consulting room usually with no windows, that are closed rooms, and though we wear masks, that doesn’t mean our risk is zero.” Simonis warned that if GPs and reception staff continued to get sick with Covid or to suffer burnout, it would have repercussions for the hospital system. “We always have been the gatekeepers to the tertiary health system,” she said. “If we are becoming unwell, and we can’t keep up with the load and we can’t manage patient expectations, then they will end up in hospitals. When GPs fall, the whole system breaks down.” Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com",News/Australia news,‘Squandered any gains we made’: Australian clinics overwhelmed by rising Covid cases,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/squandered-any-gains-we-made-australian-clinics-overwhelmed-by-rising-covid-cases
1/18/2022,"Most regular bills we pay are negotiable, but many of us don’t realise it and end up paying the “loyalty tax”. That tax refers to the higher prices paid by loyal customers. Often applied to banking products, this is also true for other regular bills we pay. Providers normally have enticing sign-up deals to poach new customers. Meanwhile, existing customers end up paying higher prices, hence termed the loyalty tax.  What can you do about it? Negotiate! Most of your regular bills, such as phone, electricity or gas, are up for negotiation. Here’s how to do it in three steps. First, you need to compare prices on what you need. Look around for the best deals. Once you’ve found a better deal for what you need, get a quote via email. This will be useful in step 2. Be aware, however, that some comparison websites may recommend certain products in exchange for a commission. These are normally labelled “sponsored” or “ad”. Now that you know what’s out there, hop on a call with your provider. Here’s what to say: “I’ve been a customer for __________ years. I’m looking to reduce my __________ bill. I’m currently paying __________. However, __________ is offering me __________. Can you beat it? Otherwise, I have to consider switching.” Ask for the new offer in writing. You can think about it and give them an answer later. If they can’t offer you a better deal, it may be worth leaving. Remember, when you’re paying something regularly, a small saving per month accumulates to hundreds of dollars saved every year. There are a few things to keep in mind before you attempt to renegotiate a bill. First, always speak to someone who has the authority to negotiate. If you do switch, make note of any introductory offers and when they expire. And finally, repeat process every few years to avoid the loyalty tax!

1/18/2022,"Some small businesses could be wiped out without immediate government help due to the Omicron outbreak, industry figures say, with hairdressers reporting up to 60% staff absenteeism. The chief executive of the Australian Hairdressing Council, Sandy Chong, said seven of the 13 staff at her salon in the New South Wales city of Newcastle had recently tested positive for the virus, swelling sick leave payments at a time when wary clients were staying away.  “Paying for the personal leave is such a stress for every small business owner,” Chong said. She has operated her salon for 36 years and never previously encountered such a squeeze. Turnover in the fortnight prior to Christmas was “just terrible” – down half on a normal year – while revenue declined two-thirds for the first week of 2022. Chong said hairdressers in her national organisation were reporting between 20 and 60% absenteeism because staff had to work in close proximity to potentially infected customers. “One of our members in Queensland has 40 staff, and she had all of them off except six. So she had to close down three salons,” Chong said. “Western Australia members are … absolutely panicking as to what’s going to happen when their borders lift.” Hairdressers were not among the industries deemed last week by the national cabinet to be essential. As such, staff who had close contact with a Covid case were not granted a shorter isolation period before returning to work. In Victoria, a mandate requiring hairdressers to be at least double vaccination was also making it harder for salons and other businesses, Chong said. Signs that companies are under strain are mounting. A survey of 2,000 members over three days earlier this month by the lobby group Business NSW found 40% “don’t have enough cashflow for the next three months”. “Short-term targeted support for those businesses and staff that arehighly impacted is a must,” Business NSW’s chief executive, Daniel Hunter, said.“Unlike previous surveys throughout 2021, where business owners felt the next quarter would get better, that isn’t the case this time as there are no government support packages in place.” Small firms are more exposed to staff shortages than bigger ones because “they don’t have the luxury of moving workers from one cafe, say, to another one”, the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, Alexi Boyd, said. Boyd said governments needed to develop targeted assistance rather than broad programs such as jobkeeper. “The support needs to evolve as the virus ebbs and flows,” she said. The chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, said businesses were “facing a triple blow of acute staff shortages due to isolation requirements, a supply chain crunch resulting in higher costs and a sharp drop in consumer activity”. “One crucial measure that will boost business conditions is the provision of free and widely accessible rapid antigen tests to businesses, particularly small business, to ensure staff and customers can safely return to the workplace,” McKellar said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For Kylie Clift, the past eight months have been “very tricky” for her Jim Jam Music business that offers music classes for infants to schoolchildren in the Hornsby region of northern Sydney. Parents were either putting off having children or moving their families away from Sydney leaving the company with “very minimal new business”, Clift said. The Omicron wave had further sapped demand from loyal customers. “Parents are keeping [the children] very close to them and so they haven’t been getting out and about – and that’s made a big impact on our business,” she said. “Our phones are dead.” The lack of government help – unlike during formal Covid lockdowns – means her 16-year-old business may not survive. “It’s been really hard because not all businesses can bounce back fully from all this.” The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, who is also the local MP for Hornsby, is preparing a range of support packages, announcing a $40m-plus program on Monday to aid live events. “There is no doubt we are facing an unprecedented challenge at the moment and it is having a significant impact on our economy,” Kean said. “But we expect this downturn to be short-lived as this current Omicron outbreak reaches its peak and case numbers begin to subside. “Towards the end of last year we saw NSW post a strong economic response to re-opening, and we are confident that the NSW economy will bounce back better after Omicron as it did with Delta.” Labor’s NSW shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, said the results of the Business NSW survey were “hair-raising”. “Imagine the jobs we will lose if nearly half of NSW businesses run out of cash in four months’ time,” Mookhey said. “Businesses should not blame the [NSW premier Dominic] Perrottet government for Omicron. But they should hold him to account for the poor state of preparation. “RAT test remain in short supply. The rules around close-contact are confusing. And vital programs to help businesses have criteria that are laughably out-of-date.” Chong said many businesses relied on the October to December period to get them through the first quarter of the following year. With Covid savaging the typically lucrative time of the year, 2022 was off to a grim start for many. “Many of the salons don’t have any cash that could get them through more than one or two weeks,” Chong said, adding the daily uncertainty of not knowing whether staff or customers would turn up left salons under “extreme stress”.",News/Australia news,‘Extreme stress’: Australian businesses risk going under due to impact of Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/extreme-stress-australian-businesses-risk-going-under-due-to-impact-of-omicron
1/18/2022,"Imagine in November 2019 you looked into a crystal ball and foresaw a global pandemic about which we would still be grappling two years later. Would have you then thought it would be a good time to buy or sell a house? You might have thought economic pandemonium and the shuttering of borders to overseas travellers would signal bad news for the housing market and thus it would be a good time to sell.  After all in November 2019, the market was pretty weak and house prices were barely growing. So maybe you decided to grab the money before a crash and laugh all the way to the bank. If you did, you clearly forgot the mantra of Australia’s political class – the housing market must not falter. And so two years later in November 2021, the value of new mortgages taken out was 64% higher than it had been two years earlier: Click here if the graph does not display The raft of economic stimulus measures from the record low interest rates to the HomeBuilder program have propelled a surge in mortgages being taken out: If the graph does not display click here While there had been a bit of a slowing in the growth of new mortgages during the lockdown in NSW and Victoria, November saw a strong pick up of 6.9% across the nation, led by 9% in NSW and 7.9% in Victoria: If the graph does not display click here It all suggests that house prices will continue to grow strongly at least for the first half of this year. While thankfully the growth of mortgages is not at the nutty levels observed in the middle of 2020 when the value of new mortgages rose by as much as 160% over the previous year’s levels, the current growth suggests the annual rise in property prices will remain around 15%-20% for some time: If the graph does not display click here But fortunately, we have lower interest rates, right? Well … for now. As I noted last week the market very much expects interest rates to rise this year (I must admit, I am less bullish). But even still, the lowering of interest rates has not improved affordability by as much as you might expect. Across the nation the size of the average mortgage has grown strongly during the pandemic. Among the eastern states, the average new mortgage has grown between 22% and 25% since November 2019, while in Tasmania it has increased 31%: If the graph does not display click here That massive increase is not enough to overcome the drop in interest rates. In NSW, the average mortgage in November was $769,459 – just over $156,000 more than was the case two years earlier. Had you taken out a 30-year mortgage in November 2019 worth $613,334, paying the then average discounted mortgage rate of 4.15%, you would have been paying $2,981 a month in repayments. By contrast if you had taken out a $769,459 loan in November last year at a rate of 3.45% then your repayments would be $3,434 a month – $453 more: If the graph does not display click here This is the issue of housing affordability. It’s all very well to talk up low interest rates, but if the principle has increased so much as to negate the falling rates, then you are not better off. It’s always worth remembering that falling interest rates help most those who already have a loan. Those who took out a loan in Sydney 10 years ago have absolutely benefited from falling rates – their repayments are about $1,000 less – while the increase in house prices has meant new entrants are less well off: If the graph does not display click here And crucially, those who have taken out loans in the past two years will not benefit from rates falling – this is as low as they will ever get. For first-homebuyers the news is not as bad. Overwhelmingly the growth in mortgage size has come from those likely selling their house and buying a new one: If the graph does not display click here But even here the average first-homebuyer mortgage in NSW has risen 16% ($82,362) since November 2019. This has meant paying an extra $173 a month on average compared to a first-homebuyer who took out a loan two years ago. And remember that is $173 extra. The average monthly repayments in NSW on a first-homebuyer loan paying the discount mortgage rate of 3.45% are $2,557 – or nearly $31,000 a year. So yes, low interest rates make affordability better than it would have been with higher rates. But those low rates and the fiscal measures in turn increase prices and thus affect mortgage sizes.

1/18/2022,"The shortage of rapid antigen tests for consumers is being exacerbated by state and federal governments and large corporates placing mammoth orders for the kits, causing stock to be diverted from online retailers and pharmacies. Australia is in the middle of a huge Omicron wave after state and federal governments pivoted from a policy of Covid suppression to one of “living with the virus”, causing a surge in demand for rapid antigen testing kits.  Prof Trent Twomey, the national president of the Pharmacy Guild, said his members were struggling to secure stock and many had had orders delayed by their suppliers. However, he said anecdotal reports from his members that stock was being requisitioned by governments had proved to be unsubstantiated. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, denied on Monday the commonwealth was requisitioning supplies of rapid antigen tests, as the Health Act allows. “It is a plain lie,” Hunt said of the allegations running rife on Twitter. “I have written to suppliers to say that was not the Australian government’s position.” But Twomey said requests for big orders, worth millions, from governments – both state and federal – have been hard for suppliers to ignore and there are numerous reports of retailers finding their stock unavailable, despite having paid for it in full and having confirmed delivery dates. Last week, the commonwealth announced $62m worth of orders for the tests under the “extreme urgency and unforeseen circumstances” provision of commonwealth purchasing rules. This appeared to coincide with several online retailers and pharmacies being told their supplies were delayed. Twomey said the pressure was also coming from states and territories, which were ordering rapid antigen tests for use in their testing sites for key workers, as well as from large companies ordering them to keep their workforces functioning in the latest Omicron wave. The NSW government announced it had secured 50m tests so far and had a further 15m being delivered in the next seven days. It said these would be used to keep essential government services, including schools, open, as well as to provide tests for seriously ill patients. “When we have gone and asked governments – state and federal – they tell us none of them has used [their requisitioning powers],” Twomey said. “What’s happening is that its much easier for suppliers to deal with one customer who wants 100,000 tests than 1,000. So what we are seeing is manufacturers [and suppliers] preferencing larger clients over smaller clients.” “Sometimes they are corporate Australia and sometimes they are indeed sovereign governments,” he said Twomey said that unlike normal supply chains, where big players get discounts, the shortage of supply meant the big players were paying at or near the price that small customers were paying, making it highly attractive for suppliers to preference the big players. “Usually suppliers like to have a balance on large and small clients and make money on the small sale orders,” he said. “But right now demand is so outstripping supply the big guys are paying the same price.” Community pharmacies have agreed with the federal government to supply 10 free rapid antigen tests to concession holders from 24 January. Twomey warned last week there was a major hurdle ahead to source adequate supplies for concession holders. At the same time, community pharmacists are working to source supplies of rapid antigen tests for private sales. “This is a huge logistical exercise, at short notice. Pharmacists are moving heaven and earth to source and stock adequate supplies of RATs,” Twomey said. The federal government said last year that it had a national stockpile of 70m rapid antigen tests, but these are not the same as the ones sold in supermarkets and pharmacies for use by consumers. The stockpile is composed of “point of care tests” which require administration by a professional and come in bulk. They have been used predominantly in testing sites for frontline workers. The Morrison government appears not to have foreseen the huge surge in demand for consumer-administered tests as a result of a policy pivot towards “living with the virus”. This may explain why the it was forced to use its urgency purchasing mechanism to source consumer rapid antigen tests. The health department has been approached for comment.",News/Australia news,Rapid antigen tests: Australian consumers miss out as government and big business snap up supplies ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/rapid-antigen-tests-australian-consumers-miss-out-as-government-and-big-business-snap-up-supplies
1/18/2022,"Every time I leave the house, the refrain – phone, wallet, keys, mask – rattles around my brain while I search my bag for the essentials. Evidence that, despite how strange it felt to wear a mask way back in 2019, when we were worried about bushfire smoke inhalation, face masks have become firmly entrenched in our daily lives. Masks are proven to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission, and help keep us safe at supermarkets and in between our table and the bathroom at restaurants, but they do need to be handled with specific care to remain effective.  Most of us are quick to remove our masks when we sit down at a cafe, but Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales says you should wash or sanitise your hands before you touch your mask, and only handle it by the straps or ear loops. When you’re not using your mask, rather than shoving it in your pocket or leaving it loose in your bag, put it in a zip-lock or paper bag. If you have some disinfectant handy, you can give it a light spray before putting it away. Although the “no touching” advice applies to both cloth and disposable masks, MacIntyre says that while cloth masks were fine for other variants, they “really do not cut it against Omicron”. This is because the Omicron variant is more transmissible, so a mask that fits and filters well provides much better protection. MacIntyre says it’s best to use P2 or N95 masks, or if these aren’t available, a blue surgical mask. In this video, occupational therapist Kate Cole explains how to ensure you’re wearing your mask properly. According to MacIntyre, there are two factors that determine when a mask should be thrown away. The first is obvious, if a mask is “visibly damp or soiled” throw it out. The other factor is the length of time you’ve worn the mask, which MacIntyre says shouldn’t be more than eight to 10 hours. Although this should be considered “a rough guide”, she says, that can be doubled in the case of “extreme shortages”. It should come as no surprise that disposable face masks are an environmental hazard. According to Dr Mohammad Saberian, a researcher from RMIT University 6.8bn disposable masks are used across the globe each day. He says that since disposable face masks are mainly made of non-biodegradable plastics, they could take 450 years to break down. The good news is, Saberian and his colleagues at RMIT have shown how disposable face masks could be recycled into road-making material. They suggest that once masks have been decontaminated they could be shredded and mixed with building rubble. But Saberian says, “the main hurdle to recycling face masks and waste PPE is the lack of appropriate facilities and equipment in waste recycling facilities”. Face masks in Australia are put in the rubbish bin, collected with household waste and sent to landfill. Saberian says designated bins for face masks or waste PPE should be implemented, at least for busy locations like hospitals, aged care facilities and shopping centres. But MacIntyre says for now, you should make sure you dispose of masks in the rubbish bin: “please do not litter or leave used masks lying around”. What about all the cloth masks we’ve begrudgingly collected? They are still better than wearing nothing, and need to be machine washed at 60C after each day’s use. That means if you are wearing cloth masks daily, you’ll need to have several on rotation. The founder of Maison Modulare, Chrys Wong, suggests machine washing “on a gentle cycle with like colours and like size articles” then using a tumble dryer, ironing or steaming the mask afterward, to provide further sterilisation. As for straps, “unfortunately, once the strap is detached from the mask itself, it’s very difficult to sew back,” she says. If you’re not handy enough with a needle and thread to unpick and resew new elastic yourself, you should take masks to your local dry cleaner or tailor to have the elastic replaced.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Caring for Covid face masks: bag it between wears and bin it when you’re done,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/18/caring-for-covid-face-masks-bag-it-between-wears-and-bin-it-when-youre-done
1/18/2022,"Ihad yet to release an album when I was invited to play the Bendigo leg of Groovin the Moo festival in May 2017. Up until point, the biggest shows I had played had been to about 400 people in Melbourne. Montaigne was on the festival lineup and she was unwell so they shuffled everyone around. Amy Shark – who was riding the wave of Adore and having a real moment – got bumped from the big tent to the main stage and they upgraded me and my band from the fucken car park or something to the big tent.  It all happened quickly, so the likelihood that the information was disseminated to the entire crowd was very unlikely. We got to the gig and just before we came on I saw the tent had like 7,000 people in it. I thought: “Fuck. All these people are here to see Amy Shark and she’s not going to come on stage. It’s going to be me!” I walked on and the first thing I said was: “I’m really sorry, I’m not Amy Shark, but my name’s Alex Lahey and we’re going to play a really good show for you.” There were a few boos. Up until then, I had always played small rooms and I felt really comfortable in that domain, so it wasn’t until my mouth opened and we started performing the first song that I was like: “Holy shit, I have enormous stage fright.” I Love You Like a Brother was the opener and there’s not much room to breathe in that song. I was trying to suck in as much air as I could and keep my balance. My knees went really weak – they turned to jelly. I had that sensation where you’re simultaneously really cold and sweating. There were these big LED screens behind the stage but we hadn’t prepared anything for them, so they put up stock images of flames the entire time – it looked like some kind of Tool show with this white girl singing indie rock. I felt really dizzy and funky. It was so out of any reality I had considered – staring down the barrel of 7,000 people in front of me with flames on this screen behind me. It was like a runaway train. Once my legs stopped shaking I was trying to do my best Bruce Springsteen. He’s the ultimate arena big-crowd rock’n’roll dude. Whenever I think: “How do you capture that audience in those massive situations?” he’s the guy. I was thinking: “This is a beautiful accident and it might never happen again, so just have a great time – be in the moment and enjoy it.” The second-last song we played was You Don’t Think You Like People Like Me. It had made the Triple J Hottest 100 that year and when I saw people singing along, that’s when the “I have to win you over”’ mentality left and I could just enjoy the show. When the adrenaline kicks in, you let it take you away and you respond to that. I had this half-hour window where I had these people who hadn’t come to see me, but – and this was the thing that baffled me – they all stayed. I was playing a white Fender Mustang and at the end of the gig I threw my guitar to my stage tech – it was one of those rock’n’roll things I had always wanted to do. There’s a great photo where the guitar is in mid-air and going to him. It was a classic Bruce move. When we got invited back to do the entire Groovin the Moo festival tour the following year I did the same guitar trick but I didn’t throw it far enough and it just slammed straight to the ground. That guitar has now done its dash. That 2017 Groovin the Moo show was me simultaneously living out a fantasy and trying to figure out how to do it. It was the breakthrough moment – a real zero-to-hero experience. Alex Lahey’s latest single Spike the Punch is out now.

1/18/2022,"As I read Polly Toynbee’s article on the government’s intention to end the BBC’s licence fee (The BBC must defend itself with all its might against this mortal threat, 16 January), I felt a sense of despair rarely experienced in my 70-plus years on this earth. Once again, this government is continuing along the path taken by so many corrupt and failing states by taking away yet another fundamental pillar that helps create a strong democratic society – access to a fair, independent and balanced news media prepared to inform, educate and challenge. This is just one aspect of the government’s wider agenda designed to restrict all that is essential for a robust and healthy democracy. The list is extensive: cronyism through the awarding of contracts without due process; legislation restricting the democratic right to peaceful protest; manipulating voting processes and constituency boundaries for party political gain; the prorogation of parliament to avoid scrutiny and debate; interfering with and undermining the authority of those implementing judicial and disciplinary processes.  The BBC, with all its faults and failings, is one of this country’s glittering achievements – respected and valued worldwide. If we allow its voice to be diminished, the standing and reputation of this country will itself be greatly diminished.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  If the licence fee goes, the BBC will be reduced to a rump broadcaster on the lines of public broadcasting in the US. Every month, all radio and TV stations will spend several days asking for donations to keep going. Radio 3 and Radio 4 will disappear as functioning entities. Radio 2 might just about survive. Local radio will disappear, with the possible exception in extremely large cities. News will be reduced to a skeleton operation reliant on press agencies. Educational broadcasting and children’s television programmes will disappear. All the science provision will dissolve. Documentaries will vanish. There will be no room to encourage new writing or music. Social information activities will cease. The BBC is not a streaming service. All the big platforms do one thing only, and often do it well. But they have no obligations to provide factual news, research, or programmes that examine in detail social issues, eg File on 4. The Tories loathe the BBC and they have always wanted to get rid of it. Abolishing the licence fee will achieve that.Philip ClaytonEdgware, London  What should the BBC do next? Take the threat seriously – how? Play for the highest stakes possible. Namely, it should call the government’s bluff by mothballing its ridiculous “editorial balance” principle and start exposing, via a variety of genres, how the Tories have worked tirelessly to destroy the UK’s democratic institutions, one by one, in pursuit of the alignment of the country’s fortunes to the wilder shores of US republicanism. The Conservative methodology of covertly privatising our great institutions while pretending the opposite is well established: reduce spending such that services suffer, and then the public-funding model is obviously faulty and only the profit-making sector can rescue it. We’ve seen this with the railways (look where that got us), it’s happening to the NHS, and now it’s proposed with the BBC. As Jim Waterson points out (Report, 16 January), “The BBC has already made substantial cost savings … the public should prepare for the BBC to provide less high-end drama and sports coverage … This could in turn erode support for the BBC if the public no longer feel they are receiving value for money from the licence fee.” There we have it: goodbye to the BBC.Dr Richard CarterPutney, London  For many people, the BBC is as important to this country as the NHS. It is a source of honesty and integrity that is sadly lacking in politicians. The action of this government is going to come back to bite it. It should by now be fully aware that the voting public are not mugs. They will see the plans for what they are: outright political vindictiveness and a cheap smokescreen to cover their leader.Colin BarlowTarporley, Cheshire  So “the days of the elderly being threatened with prison and bailiffs knocking on doors are over”. Those days only started when this government ended funding for free licences for the over-75s.Geoffrey WheelerCoventry  Given the Conservative party’s apparent inability to understand for what and for whom the BBC exists, isn’t it time to consider making parliament a subscription service?Graham McCannCambridge  So the “culture” secretary, Nadine Dorries, is freezing the BBC licence fee for two years, which will mean significant cuts before the service is eliminated. We could crowdfund a licence fee top-up for the next two years, in time for a new, properly cultured government to save our national broadcaster.
