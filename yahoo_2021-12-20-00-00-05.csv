12/20/2021,"SEATTLE (AP) — Washington state Sen. Doug Ericksen, a staunch conservative, has died at age 52. Ericksen's death Friday came weeks after he said he had tested positive for the coronavirus while in El Salvador, though his cause of death wasn't immediately released. The state Senate Republican Caucus confirmed his passing Saturday but did not say where he died. Ericksen, a Ferndale Republican, reached out to Republican colleagues last month saying he had taken a trip to El Salvador and tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after he arrived. Reasons for his visit were unclear. In a message to state House and Senate members, Ericksen asked for advice on how to receive monoclonal antibodies, which were not available in the Latin American nation. He soon arranged a medevac flight from El Salvador, former state Rep. Luanne Van Werven said. Van Werven said the next week that the senator was recovering at a Florida hospital. No information about his location or condition had since been released. Ericksen represented the 42nd District in Whatcom County and had been in the Legislature since 1998, the Seattle Times reported. He served six terms in the state House before being elected to the Senate in 2010. Ericksen was a former leader of Donald Trump’s campaign in Washington. He also was an outspoken critic of Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee’s COVID-19 emergency orders, and had introduced legislation aimed at protecting the rights of people who do not wish to get vaccinated. It was unclear if Ericksen had been inoculated against the coronavirus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people should be fully vaccinated before visiting El Salvador, where current levels of COVID-19 are “high.”",U.S./Associated Press,Washington state Sen.

12/20/2021,"Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen tore into onetime White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Saturday. Cohen appeared on an airing of “MSNBC Reports” to discuss his new lawsuit levied against the former president. When the conversation pivoted to Meadows, the lawyer didn’t mince words. “Hey stupid, you put out a book,” Cohen said in a rather direct address to Meadows. He added that because of Meadows’ tell-all memoir, “The Chief’s Chief,” Jan. 6 investigators “now have the right to ask you about things” regarding the insurrection. Meadows is claiming executive privilege and refusing to cooperate with the House select committee on the Jan. 6 riot — after he wrote about details in his own book, and released thousands of pages of texts and emails and other documents linked to the upheaval. Cohen’s critiques of Meadows didn’t end there. He also called the former Trump aide a “dope” and the “dumbest a-hole on the Hill.” On Tuesday, the House voted to recommend criminal charges against Meadows for contempt of Congress. Cohen, who was once regarded as Trump’s “fixer,” doesn’t appear to hold out any hope Trump will come to Meadows’ aid. “It’s always somebody else’s fault” as far as Trump is concerned, said Cohen. He said everything he did was “at the direction of and for the benefit of my employer. I did it for the benefit of Donald J. Trump.” Cohen finished out his three-year prison sentence, which mostly consisted of home confinement, last month. The 55-year-old had been convicted on a number of offenses, including lying to Congress and campaign finance violations. Cohen said that, given the overwhelming number of texts and emails from people in Trump’s circle bared by Meadows, the big question is: “Who’s the next one to be thrown under the bus?” Check out Cohen’s full interview in the video clip above. Fast-forward to the 3:30 mark to hear his comments about Meadows.
