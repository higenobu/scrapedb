4/5/2022,"As inflation hits a 40-year high, you may be asking yourself if you actually have too much money in your traditional savings account. Most people should set aside enough cash to cover about six months of living expenses, says Matthew Jenkins, certified financial planner at Noble Hill Planning. With that in mind, it may seem counterintuitive to keep an emergency stash of liquid cash within arm’s reach, but Lauren Anastasio, director of financial advice at Stash, the online financial platform, says inflation is your cash’s greatest enemy — but cash is still king in the short-term.",Business/MarketWatch•13 hours ago,"‘A plan to protect any excess cash is vital.’ As inflation sits at a 40-year high, here’s who has ‘too much’ in savings right now",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4f4a3dbc-be1b-3ce9-8b4d-18e87a5fdf28/%E2%80%98a-plan-to-protect-any-excess.html
4/5/2022,"One of the catches when you use a tax-advantaged retirement account like a 401(k) or an IRA is that once you hit a certain age, you have to start taking a minimum amount of money out each year - to stop people from protecting the money from taxes for too long. Some may wonder, though, if they can simply reinvest that money immediately. The answer is that yes, you can put the money you take out in required minimum distributions back in the market right away - so long as you don't use another tax-advantaged account. For more help with retirement investments, consider working with a financial advisor. What Is A Required Minimum Distribution? As the IRS puts it, ""You cannot keep retirement funds in your account indefinitely."" The required minimum distribution addresses that issue. When you have a tax-advantaged retirement account, like a 401(k) or an IRA, the IRS requires you to begin making withdrawals once you reach the maximum age. That age is: 72 years old if you turn or turned 70 after June 1, 2019; 70.5 (that is, six months after you turn 70) if you turned 70 before June 1, 2019. After this age, you must begin making what the IRS calls ""required minimum distributions,"" or RMDs. This is the minimum amount that you must withdraw from your retirement account each year or else you risk facing tax penalties. You can withdraw more than this amount if you would like, but you may not withdraw less. The reason for this is that your withdrawals are included in your taxable income. Tax-advantaged retirement accounts allow you to defer paying taxes on certain portions of your income until retirement, but eventually the IRS would like to get this money. Minimum distributions ensure that you begin paying taxes on your retirement account eventually. Per the IRS's website, required minimum distributions apply to the following accounts: traditional IRAs SEP IRAs SIMPLE IRAs 401(k) plans 403(b) plans 457(b) plans profit-sharing plans other defined-contribution plans Required minimum distributions do not apply to Roth IRAs. This is the only significant tax-advantaged retirement account that is omitted from this requirement. You do not have to pay taxes here because you have already paid taxes on the money you invested, so the IRS does not have anything unpaid to collect from you. How Much Are Required Minimum Distributions? Your required minimum distribution changes from household to household and year to year. As the IRS describes it: ""The required minimum distribution for any year is the account balance as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year divided by a distribution period from the IRS's ‘Uniform Lifetime Table.' A separate table is used if the sole beneficiary is the owner's spouse who is 10 or more years younger than the owner."" This is less complicated than it seems. Basically, you follow three steps: Find your account balance as of Dec. 31 in the preceding year; Find your applicable distribution factor, generally it's age-based and goes down as you get older; and Divide your account balance by your distribution factor. Here is the chart for determining your distribution factor (keep in mind that if you turned 70 after June 1, 2019, you don't have to take an RMD until age 72: IRA Required Minimum Distributions Age Distribution Period 70 27.4 71 26.5 72 25.6 73 24.7 74 23.8 75 22.9 76 22.0 77 21.2 78 20.3 79 19.5 80 18.7 81 17.9 82 17.1 83 16.3 84 15.5 85 14.8 86 14.1 87 13.4 88 12.7 89 12.0 90 11.4 91 10.8 92 10.2 93 9.6 94 9.1 95 8.6 96 8.1 97 7.6 98 7.1 99 6.7 100 6.3 101 5.9 102 5.5 103 5.2 104 4.9 105 4.5 106 4.2 107 3.9 108 3.7 109 3.4 110 3.1 111 2.9 112 2.6 113 2.4 114 2.1 115 and over 1.9 So, for example, say you have $500,000 in your retirement account as of Dec. 31 and, per the Uniform Lifetime Table, have a distribution factor of 25. You would divide $500,000by 25, to get a minimum withdrawal of $20,000 in this calendar year. Remember that required minimum distributions are calculated per account and per year. So if you have multiple retirement accounts, you must calculate your required minimum distribution for each retirement account each year. Can You Reinvest Your Required Minimum Distribution? You can reinvest your required minimum distribution in any account or asset that is not a tax-advantaged retirement account. So, for example, you could buy stocks, bonds, real estate or any other financial assets with your RMD. However, you could not put this money into an IRA or a 401(k). The exception to this rule is the Roth IRA. If you are eligible to put money into a Roth IRA, you can do so with required minimum distribution money. (In general, Roth IRAs are exempt from RMD rules.) In other words, except for Roth IRAs, so long as the IRS isn't giving you a tax break on the portfolio, feel free to reinvest. The Bottom Line  You can reinvest a required minimum distribution so long as you don't put the money into a tax-advantaged retirement account. Other than that, you're free to do as you please.

4/5/2022,"The stock market can be a fickle place, as we’ve seen this year. Starting early in January, all the main indexes fell, in a broad-based sell-off caused, at least in part, by worries over inflation and the Federal Reserve’s decision to start raising interest rates in response. The promised end of the central bank’s long-standing easy money policy spooked investors. The currents shifted in mid-March, however, after the Fed pulled the trigger with a quarter-point rate hike. The collective mind calmed down, took a deep breath – and markets rebounded. Investors also seemed encouraged by negotiations aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war. The S&P 500 is officially out of correction territory now, and trending upwards. While starting back up, markets are still down this year – and that means that plenty of stocks are down even further, since the indexes are only averages. With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to find three stocks that are showing depressed prices along with strong fundamentals – a combination that bodes well when markets are rising. They all have Strong Buy consensus ratings, while their share prices are hovering at 52-week low levels. We can find out more by taking a quick look under the hood. Asure Software (ASUR) We’ll start with Asure Software, a resource and solution provider in human capital management, or HCR. Asure offers software packages to make payroll and tax accounting easy. The company boasts over 80,000 small- to mid-market companies in its customer base, and processes over 33 million paychecks annually. We are entering the US tax season, and Asure’s products are in high demand. In one example of this, the company announced in February that it had filed for over $200 million in stimulus funding on behalf of its clients. Last month, Asure released its financial results for 4Q21. For the quarter, the company reported $21.1 million in revenue, up 29% year-over-year. The full-year revenue came in at $76.1 million, for a gain of 16% y/y. Non-GAAP net EPS was reported at 2 cents per share, compared to a break-even in 4Q20. It’s important to note that the company’s big earnings quarter is Q1. Asure’s stock is down 24% so far this year. While in part this can be attributed to the general market downturn early in the year, the company’s guidance has likely not helped. While still predicting revenue growth, the company’s guidance shows it expects to slow down this year. The Q1 guidance was $23.5 million at the midline, or up 18% y/y, while the full year guidance, of $87.5 million at the midline, predicts a 14% y/y gain. On earnings, however, the 4 to 6 cent non-GAAP EPS predicted in the first quarter is less than half of the 12 cents reported in 1Q21. Weighing in from Roth Capital, 5-star analyst Richard Baldry believes that Asure won’t be down for long. He writes: “In our view, ASUR appears poised to improve organic growth materially in 2022 as recent aggressive sales hiring yields greater productivity with deepening tenure. Therefore, with ASUR trading at only 1.8x run-rate revenues (net of net debt), or roughly 75% lower than our 7.3x SaaS peer average, we see material upside ahead if growth re-accelerates as we expect."" Given all of the above, Baldry has high hopes. Along with a Buy rating, the analyst keeps a $16 price target on the stock. This target puts the upside potential at a whooping 169%. (To watch Baldry’s track record, click here) The unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating on ASUR shares, based on 6 positive analyst reviews, shows that the Street is upbeat on this stock. The average price target, at $12.08, suggests an upside of 103% from the current trading price of $5.95. (See ASUR stock forecast on TipRanks) Citi Trends (CTRN) Next up is Citi Trends, an apparel retailer specializing in discounted ‘urban chic.’ The company is based in Savannah, Georgia, and runs more than 600 brick-and-mortar stores in 33 states. Citi Trends also has a full-service online site, and a strong e-commerce presence. After its revenues and earnings surged when the economy began to reopen in 4Q20 and 1Q21, Citi Trends has seen the top and bottom lines fall back toward the end of 2021. The Q4 financial results showed $240.9 million at the top line, down from $251.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Diluted EPS was reported at $1.16, down 35% from 4Q20. While these numbers showed a year-over-year drop off, they still came in above expectations. Before the release, EPS was forecast at $1.07, and the result beat that by ~8%. What hit the company hard, however, was a trim to 2021 full-year guidance issued in January. Management cited a combination of resurgent COVID and lower store traffic when cut back its full-year 2021 revenue prediction from the $1 billion to $1.015 billion range to the range of $990 million to $995 million. In the event, the 2021’s top line came in at $991.6 million. Benchmark analyst John Lawrence is not concerned by the mixed results of the recent quarters, and lays out a case for buying this stock now “We have been impressed by the changes implemented by the management team over the past couple of years. Our thesis continues to focus on the new CTx store format which changes the merchandise presentation. Management indicated February and March results have improved. The productivity curve is in place as better buying improves the sell through and enhances margin with reduced markdowns. Improved visibility of new unit and remodel performance is the primary catalyst going forward. The comp performance is enhanced as theremodels enter the comp base. We continue to recommend purchase,” Lawrence opined. In light of those comments, Lawrence recommends this stock as a Buy. His $70 price target indicates a 136% one-year upside potential. (To watch Lawrence’s track record, click here) Lawrence is not alone in his bullish take on Citi Trends; the stock has 4 recent analyst reviews, all positive, making for a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. Shares are trading for $29.65 and their $63.75 average price target implies an upside of 115% from that level. (See CTRN stock forecast on TipRanks) Floor & Decor Holdings (FND) Last up is Floor & Decor Holdings. Founded back in 2000, and based in Atlanta, Georgia, the company offers a wide range of hard-surface flooring for everything from homes to stores to offices. The company operates 2 design studios and 160 large warehouse stores, averaging 78,000 square feet, in 33 states. The company caters to professional contractors, home improvement retailers, and do-it-yourselfers. Floor & Decor offers a range of products, from laminate flooring to vinyl to tiles to wood to natural stone. In the past two months, FND has opened 7 new stores, in locations as far-flung as Portland, Oregon; Chicago, Illinois; and McAllen, Texas. These openings are part of a concerted plan by management to reach 400 stores in the coming decade; the company plans to open a total of 32 stores this year alone. That ambitious plan is fueled by rising revenues and earnings that, until the most recently reported quarter (4Q21) had been consistently beating expectations. At the top line, the last report showed $914.3 million, up 26% year-over-year. At the bottom line, diluted EPS came in at 44 cents. This was the second quarter in a row with a sequential earnings decline, and the result was down more than 6% y/y. Looking ahead, the company estimates full-year 2022 revenues to come in at approximately $4.325 billion. This would represent a gain of 26% y/y. Despite the growth, FND shares have fallen 36% so far this year. Well Fargo’s 5-star analyst Zachary Fadem sees high potential for Floor & Decor going forward, especially in the pro contractor niche. He writes of this stock: “FND sits among the few unicorns in retail, with a business model strong enough to post consistently strong (MSD%+) comps, +20% unit growth and a host of opportunity from Pro initiatives, an emerging design concept and inorganic Commercial growth... At 32x NTM PE (-19%/-24% vs 3/5 year avg.), we see a compelling LT entry point for one of the highest quality growth stories in all of retail."" This, among other things, including residential remodeling and an addressable market totaling $49 billion to $54 billion, leads Fadem to set an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on FND shares, and his $130 price target suggests an upside potential of 56% for the year ahead. (To watch Fadem’s track record, click here) Overall, this stock has picked up plenty of interest from Wall Street – in the form of 15 recent analyst reviews. These break down 12 to 3 in favor of Buy over Hold, propping up the Strong Buy consensus. The shares are trading at $83.28 and their $129.80 average target suggests a one-year upside of ~56%.

4/5/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The recent rebound in equity markets will prove short-lived, one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears said on Monday, advising investors to seek refuge in bonds as economic growth slows. Most Read from Bloomberg A 30-Year-Old Crypto Billionaire Wants to Give His Fortune Away China Finds New Virus Subtype as Daily Cases Exceed 13,000 Elon Musk Takes 9.2% Stake in Twitter After Hinting at Shake-Up Ukraine Update: More Talks Possible Even as Bucha Outrage Grows Ukraine Update: Kyiv Warns Russia Is Adding Troops in Moldova “The bear market rally is over,” Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “That leaves us more constructive on bonds than stocks over the near term as growth concerns take center stage – hence our doubling down on a defensive bias.” Wilson’s thesis is that the economy is heading for a sharp slowdown, due to a “payback in demand from last year’s fiscal stimulus, demand destruction from high prices, food and energy price spikes from the war that serve as a tax, and inventory builds that have now caught up to demand.” This less forgiving macroeconomic backdrop will become increasingly harder for investors to ignore, as it eats away at corporate profits. Despite concerns that the war raging in Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions targeting one of the bedrocks of global commodity supply will exacerbate record inflationary pressures, U.S. and European equities rebounded last month, paring their quarterly losses. Wilson and his team had advised investors to sell the rally, arguing that it lacks legs. The bearish view contrasts sharply with JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s team, which has been persistently calling for more upside to equities, saying growth concerns are overblown. “Geopolitics remains a wild card, but we do not see equities fundamental risk-reward to be as bearish as it is currently fashionable to portray,” JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. While Morgan Stanley’s Wilson doubled down on his recommendation for defensive stocks, Matejka and his colleagues said traditional defensives “should not have legs to a bounce beyond the geopolitical dislocation,” advising an underweight position. At the start of the year, Wilson had the lowest year-end target for the S&P 500 index out of all the equity strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. He had similarly bearish views in 2021, which he later acknowledged were “wrong,” amid a brisk rally that pushed the main U.S. benchmark to successive records.

4/5/2022,"Beating the Monday blues will be especially trying for Google employees this week. Starting today, workers are required to come into company headquarters three times a week. But according to Laszlo Bock, former chief of Google human resources and current CEO of Humu, this hybrid model won’t be around much longer. Bock says that after three to five years of flexible work models and hybrid plans, the normal in-office schedule will prevail at Google—and beyond. He predicts this transition will happen over the next few years, telling Bloomberg it’s the “boil the frog method.” “The purpose of the ‘boil the frog method’ [is] to do it subtly and thereby avoid difficult questions and conflict,” Bock told Fortune. “But that’s not only bad for trust and morale, it’s also not the best thing for employees or for the company.” Bock said his research at Humu shows that the perfect mix of employee productivity and worker happiness is a 3+2 schedule, in which three days are spent in the office, and two are remote. This combination, he says, gives individuals the chance to build relationships in-office and work on individual tasks that are easier at home. But Bock says that executives are reluctant to accept permanent work-from-home models. This could be due to the large investment that companies make when buying luxury offices. But it could also have to do with management itself. “Most executives have been working in offices for 20 to 30 years, so it’s comfortable for them. It’s the environment in which they know how to lead,” he told Fortune. “They want to go back to what is familiar, and they believe their experience trumps what Humu’s science shows: A hybrid model is better for productivity and happiness than being in the office five days a week.” When the pandemic hit in 2020, many white-collar jobs shifted to remote work for safety reasons. The tech sector readily adapted to this new format, as many employees learned that they liked the flexibility that working from home afforded them. But a new wave of companies, including tech giants like Meta and Apple, are starting to try to coax (or summon) their workers back to their headquarters. While some studies have shown that this shift to virtual work does not lead to a lack of employee productivity, Bock tells Fortune that this research is missing the full story. “It’s true that total workforce productivity hasn’t changed, but workforce productivity per hour worked has dropped. People are working longer hours, taking fewer breaks, and working on weekends because it’s become impossible to turn off work.” He adds that there is an emotional toll to working isolated without any teammates or coworkers present. Bock said he thinks workers will likely begin to want to come into the office themselves when they see bosses giving more promotions and opportunities to staff who are in the building over those who work from home. The new power dynamic will likely force reluctant employees to get back to the office when trying to gain favor with their supervisors. Bosses looking to push their employees back to their headquarters should make sure that there are obvious benefits to coming into work. Whether that be providing in-person coaching opportunities or free lunches, Bock suggests that employers make the perks to working in the office clear. He also urges companies to ensure that their promises hold weight. “Many companies will promise a great in-office experience but will fail to deliver,” Bock said.
