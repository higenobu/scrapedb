1/26/2022," One in 10 adults in the UK have dyslexia, and this includes the hugely affable Jay Blades, furniture restorer and host of The Repair Shop. This one-off programme follows Blades from not being able to read the letter awarding him his MBE to vowing to be able to read to his daughter by the time she turns 16. We then follow him as he takes literacy lessons – all the while showing the reality of dyslexia with heart, candour and that East End charm.

1/26/2022,"Kiwi doubles player Michael Venus has unleashed on Australian Open spectators and Nick Kyrgios, labelling the Australian an immature “absolute knob” after losing in the quarter-finals to the “Special Ks”. Venus and German Tim Pütz went down in three sets to Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis on Tuesday at Kia Arena, where a raucous crowd supported the all-Australian partnership who had hammed it up for the vocal fans.  Venus, 34, on Wednesday said the sledging from the crowd was at times intolerable and some spectators made comments about him and his family as he prepared to serve. “It felt like a circus out there and not really a tennis match,” Venus told New Zealand television channel 1News. “Between serves [they were] geeing the crowd up and getting them to cheer at times like that. I don’t think that’s really on. “You know if it’s on the other foot, old mate [Kyrgios] would have flipped his lid. He already did get mad there by himself. It’s amazing, he can smash a ball out that hits a kid and just ‘cause he gives them a racket afterwards people can say he’s such a good guy.” The on-court tension between Venus and Kyrgios, in particular, was noticeable and both had words with each other and the umpire over perceived injustices. Kyrgios also mocked Venus’s at-times wayward ball toss. Venus said on Wednesday that Kyrgios’s supporters messaged him on social media “an extreme amount” but there were also “a lot of messages from other people saying how embarrassed they were with the crowd’s behaviour and they’re sorry, it shouldn’t have been like that”. “They’ll always be his supporters and he’ll always spin it in a way that helps him but at the end of the day, he’s just an absolute knob,” Venus said. “On the maturity side, you see why he’s never fulfilled his potential and probably never will. His maturity level, it’s probably being generous to a 10-year-old, to say it’s at about that level.” The New Zealander acknowledged Kyrigos was an “unbelievable tennis player” who had “amazing” on-court intelligence. Kyrgios, who is ranked No 115 in the world, has not yet responded to the criticism. Kyrgios and Kokkinakis will play Thursday’s semi-final against Marcel Granollers of Spain and Horacio Zeballos of Argentina on Rod Laver Arena after the tournament director, Craig Tiley, announced they had been moved to centre court due to their popularity. “We’re actually going to move the Special Ks from Kia Arena onto Rod Laver Arena,” Tiley told host broadcaster, the Nine Network, on Wednesday. Tiley also said any spectator holding a ground pass would be able to access Rod Laver Arena to watch the pair and stay to see newly named Australian of the Year Dylan Alcott play his men’s quad singles final against Sam Schröder of the Netherlands. It will be the final match of Alcott’s career. “We want to make Dylan’s match the most-watched wheelchair tennis match in the history of the game tomorrow afternoon,” Tiley said. Crowd capacity, currently capped at 50% for the tournament, will be raised to 65% for the finals, the Victorian sport minister, Martin Pakula, tweeted on Wednesday. “Breaking my self imposed Twitter hiatus (which I will return to – it’s blissful) to advise that the chief health officer has agreed to increase the ticketed capacity of the Australian Open to 65% for the remainder of the tournament,” he wrote.",Sport/Sport,New Zealand player labels Nick Kyrgios an ‘absolute knob’ after losing doubles match to Australian pair,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/26/new-zealand-player-labels-nick-kyrgios-an-absolute-knob-after-losing-doubles-match-to-australian-pair
1/26/2022,"While thousands of people marched around the country in protest on Invasion Day and gathered in Canberra in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, a day of mourning was held in Melbourne in the way most events in the Victorian capital have been held over the past two years: over a livestream. Organisers of the Melbourne, Hobart and Darwin Invasion Day events cancelled large in-person events this year due to high numbers of Omicron Covid cases within the Aboriginal community.  The dawn service, a ritual that began with a few hundred people at the Kings Domain Resting Place in 2019, was held online from 5.30am. More than 3,000 people watched via the Victorian Naidoc Facebook page. The ceremony featured words from past services from Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy Murphy and the Victorian Greens senator Lidia Thorpe, a Gunnai, Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung woman, who also held a small mourning ceremony for First Nations women on the steps of Victorian state parliament on Monday night. Then Uncle Jack Charles read through a list of massacres that occurred in Victoria from 1834 to 1850. The massacre sites are all over Victoria: Murdering Flats, Chimney Pots, Murdering Gully, Fighting Hills, Aire River, Snowy River, Mount Eccles, Mount Napier, and many more. The total death toll, from recorded massacres in Victoria, is 1,186. Research by the University of Newcastle has identified 311 massacre sites in Australia, dating from 1788 to 1930. The full death toll from frontier violence is unknown. Thorpe said the need to protect vulnerable community members from Covid meant people were “grieving in their homes”. “This is a day where we come together and mourn together … as a community, as families and allies,” she told Guardian Australia. “The strength that you feel when you’re surrounded by people who are standing in solidarity on this day is a feeling of hope … not having that presence and that activism out there on this day is hard. It is very hard. I just want to acknowledge all of those Blak families at home today who are feeling the pain, the loss and the trauma of what happened on this day.” As Charles was reading down the list, television crews began converging on a statue of Captain James Cook in St Kilda, which was doused in red paint overnight. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A short time later, in Sydney, Wiradjuri woman and Sydney City councillor Yvonne Weldon addressed the WugulOra Morning Ceremony at Barangaroo. “What took place was genocide, irreversible trauma,” she said. “Poisons, not just in our waterholes but others had in their hands, that later became placed in ours.

Why do we have to promote our invasion to make sure Australia sees us?” Elizabeth Jarrett, a Dunghutti Bundjalung activist, told the crowd. More than 500 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have died in custody in Australia in the 30 years since the royal commission. “We want to make sure our murders stop, the raping of our women, the stealing of our children ... and the desecration of our culture,” Jarrett said. Gamilaraay woman Helen Russell attended the march wearing a shirt showing the pictures of her sons Stanley and Edward Russell, who both died in custody. Edward died in Long Bay Prison in 1999 when he was 25 years old, and Stanley was shot dead by police at his Seven Hills home in Sydney last year. An inquest is yet to be held. “My two sons were killed by the system,” she told AAP. “I just cry and cry and keep on crying because we have never gotten justice. I don’t think we ever will.” In Canberra, Aboriginal people from around Australia converged on the Aboriginal Tent Embassy to mark its 50th anniversary. Gomeroi man Duglus McGrady travelled nine hours from Moree to attend. The 79-year-old, who was recently discharged from hospital after suffering three strokes, has been attending protests at the tent embassy since its inception. He was carrying an Aboriginal flag that belonged to his best friend, who has since died. “We are still fighting, we still have a long way to go,” he said. “I’m still here, that’s the main thing.” Thousands more marched through the streets of Brisbane and rallied in Perth and Adelaide.

In Hobart the rally was moved online, with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre manager Nala Mansell telling the Mercury an in-person event carried too much risk for Aboriginal people, who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.

1/26/2022,"The mole (Talpa europaea) advertises its presence by leaving lines of small hills as it excavates its way across grassy areas, often leading to its persecution. Moles used to be trapped for their velvety pelts but now, despite the fact they are good for draining soil and eating harmful insect larvae, they are killed mostly because they wreck golf greens and lawns. Despite these attacks, moles seem remarkably resilient. They live in semi-permanent burrows, sometimes hundreds of metres long, at various depths to allow for droughts and, in the winter, low temperatures. They are powerful diggers with spade-like front legs, a pink pointed snout, tiny eyes and a short tail. They weigh 80g and need to eat 50g of worms a day to survive. To ensure a regular supply, they bite worms in the head to immobilise them, then store them in chambers, dozens at a time.  Adult moles are most at risk in spring when the males enlarge their territories, tunnelling through ever-larger areas in search of females. Nests lined with a ball of dry plant material are used for sleeping and raising litters of three to four. At a month old the young disperse above ground to find their own homes, their time of greatest danger.",News/World news,Specieswatch: the secret lives of moles,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/specieswatch-the-secret-lives-of-moles
1/26/2022,"At least 100,000 “ghost flights” could be flown across Europe this winter because of EU airport slot usage rules, according to analysis by Greenpeace. The deserted, unnecessary or unprofitable flights are intended to allow airlines to keep their takeoff and landing runway rights in major airports, but they could also generate up to 2.1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions – or as much as 1.4 million average petrol or diesel cars emit in a year – Greenpeace says.  “The EU Commission requiring airlines to fly empty planes to meet an arbitrary quota is not only polluting, but extremely hypocritical given their climate rhetoric,” said Herwig Schuster, a spokesperson for Greenpeace’s European Mobility for All campaign. “Transport emissions are skyrocketing,” he said. “It would be irresponsible of the EU to not take the low-hanging fruit of ending ghost flights and banning short-haul flights where there’s a reasonable train connection.” When the Covid pandemic began, the European Commission cut the benchmark for flight operations that airlines must meet to keep their slots open from 80% to 25%. But last December, Brussels upped the benchmark to 50%, rising again to 64% in March. Lufthansa CEO, Carsten Spohr, said that his airline may have to fly 18,000 “extra, unnecessary flights” to fulfil the adjusted rules, and called for the sort of “climate-friendly exemptions” used in other parts of the world. A Lufthansa spokesperson said that between January and March 2021, just 45% of its flights were full. The other 5%, or 18,000 flights, “we define as unnecessary”, the spokesperson added. “If we wouldn’t risk the loss of slots in certain airports in Europe, we probably would have cancelled them and put them together with other existing flights.” Greenpeace applied Lufthansa’s proportion of ghost flights to other European airlines based on the German carrier’s 17% market share, using a conservative estimate of 20 tons of greenhouse gas emissions a flight. The research assumed an average flight time of 90 minutes by a 200-seater plane, over a distance of 800-1,000km. Tim Johnson, director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said that the Greenpeace assumptions were “spot on”. “It looks like an example of wastage in the industry and I think people will be surprised by the scale of it,” he said. “It hints at a real problem of airlines being forced to operate either empty or very low-occupancy flights in order to maintain their slots.” Socialist MEPs in the European parliament have demanded answers on the problem, and Greta Thunberg, the climate strike leader, sardonically tweeted that “the EU surely is in a climate emergency mode”. The European Commission denies that air carriers are operating ghost flights, or that its “use it or lose it” slot rules have created problems. A commission spokesperson said: “Empty flights are bad for the economy and the environment which is exactly why we took several measures allowing companies to not have such empty flights. If airline companies decide to keep empty flights, this is a company decision, which is not the result of EU rules.” Brussels argues that it has already cut slot requirements and that airlines can request that even those be stood down if flights are disrupted by “severe sanitary measures” such as new government travel restrictions. Earlier this month the Ryanair CEO, Michael O’Leary, complained that big airlines benefited from generous EU breaks, “and now Lufthansa’s still not happy. They don’t want to operate ghost flights because: ‘Ohhh, the environment’,” he told Politico. The cut-price Irish airline wants Lufthansa to sell unsold tickets at cheap prices and for the commission to force it to release unused slots. Air France says that it wants greater slot rule flexibility, but a spokesperson said that it would not give data on how many under-capacity and unnecessary flights it was currently flying. Johnson said that it was right to focus on climate impacts when huge amounts of CO2 were being emitted unnecessarily but that there was a “wider industry battle” which pointed to the need for slot reform. “We need something that genuinely rewards efficiency,” he said. “Some sort of efficiency metric as the basis for allocating slots that would allow an operator with a modern full plane to be preferred over rival carriers, who are operating with much lower load factors or older technologies.”",News/Environment,Airlines flying near-empty ‘ghost flights’ to retain EU airport slots,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/airlines-flying-near-empty-ghost-flights-to-retain-eu-airport-slots
1/26/2022,"From the very beginning of the pandemic, disabled people have been treated as an add-on. See, for example, how deaf people were ignored in Downing Street’s vital public health messaging, with no British Sign Language interpreter used in daily briefings. Those with intellectual and development disabilities were initially not on the priority list for vaccines, despite being five times more at risk of hospitalisation and eight times more likely to die from Covid. I am a survivor of polio, a crippling disease that is preventable by a vaccine – which was one reason that my Covid jab felt like an early Christmas present. As a Paralympian and a campaigner for access and inclusion, it has been incredibly frustrating to see a clinically vulnerable group being treated as an afterthought, or even as apparently undeserving of medical treatment.  In early 2021, the charity Mencap warned that some disabled people were receiving letters saying they would not be resuscitated if they became ill with Covid-19, after “do not resuscitate” orders were illegally placed on some disabled patients during the first wave. This horrified me. In this and so many other ways, the Covid-19 pandemic has widened and deepened the exclusion of people with disabilities, and given the world a taste of how quickly a marginalised group can fall off a country’s agenda and become almost invisible. I have felt the same pain this week, as preparations were made to end all plan B measures on Wednesday – including wearing masks on public transport and guidance to work from home. I watched the prime minister announce this last week as he tried to save his own career after apparently flouting the lockdown restrictions he put in place to keep the most vulnerable safe. His announcement was met with cheers in the House of Commons; on my television at home, it was met with horror. My first thought was of my clinically vulnerable friends, many of whom have barely left their homes in two years. Catching Covid could still be very dangerous even after being vaccinated, and those who are immunocompromised may not respond to vaccines at all. Yet again, they have been sacrificed at the altar of political expediency. On the day the prime minister made his announcement, there were more than 100,000 confirmed Covid cases in England and nearly 19,000 people in hospital with Covid. This is an illness that has already claimed the lives of tens of thousands of disabled people like me; six out of 10 Covid deaths in England have been those of us with disabilities. Promised antiviral drugs that could help vulnerable people fight the virus have been slow to appear. Yet despite the enormous risk, we have now been told that we should return to work in person. Our children must now go to school, and may well be expected to do so without masks, knowing that alongside their homework, they could bring back a virus that could devastate our health. If we want to use public transport or go to the shops, we cannot now expect others to wear masks to help protect us. I went into a supermarket before restrictions lifted and was appalled that there were so many people not wearing their mask. It makes me very sad to see just how quickly we have forgotten what we’ve been through. My friend and fellow disability campaigner, the GP Dr Hannah Barham-Brown, spoke to me after the announcement, rightly describing this government as one that has prioritised “vino over vulnerability”. This latest escapade “laughs in the faces of the disabled community, and the health and social care staff who care for them”. Imagine how it feels to be stuck in the house for two years with little or no social contact because of your disability or vulnerability. The only human you have interacted with was your carer, the person delivering post or food, and an occasional wave through the window to family members. Disabled and clinically vulnerable people may now remain prisoners in their own homes. A caring society would have made this group a priority and considered their needs when planning to lift the restrictions. We all want to return to normal. It’s why so many of us have followed the guidelines around mask-wearing, social distancing, self-isolating and shielding. It’s because we want to get through the pandemic and return to freely hugging our loved ones, travelling without fear of getting infected in transit, and also throwing and attending parties. We are told we need to live with Covid in the long term. But living with this virus should not mean putting the lives of our most vulnerable at significant risk, especially at a time when the Omicron variant has led to such high rates of infection. If this hasty lifting of all plan B restrictions is a political decision to save one politician’s career rather than a decision based on science, data and evidence, it must be reconsidered. Lives are at stake if it is not.

1/26/2022,"In the wake of Britney Spears’ emancipation from her long-term conservatorship, some of Britney’s fans have turned their attention to the Star Trek actor Nichelle Nichols. Last week a dozen protesters, a mixture of Free Britney activists and fans of Nichols, demonstrated outside the Stanley Mosk courthouse in Los Angeles, chanting “Free Nichelle!” Nichols has been living under a conservatorship since 2018. Her son Kyle Johnson successfully petitioned to be his mother’s conservator after her former manager, Gilbert Bell, was accused of abusing Nichols financially. Protesters believe that Nichols is of sound mind and wants to be released from the arrangement.  Nichols is best known for playing Lieutenant Nyota Uhura on the original Star Trek television series. As the first Black woman to play a leading role on 1960s TV, her character was inspirational to many, including Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who persuaded Nichols to stay on the show when she was considering leaving to pursue roles on Broadway. Black female actors of the time were usually relegated to playing the part of maids or other racist tropes like Sapphire or Jezebel caricatures. Nichols was also the first female African American actor to place her handprints in front of Hollywood’s Grauman’s Chinese Theatre. A civil rights advocate, her influence was felt on and off screen. After criticizing Nasa’s lack of diversity in a speech, Nichols volunteered to work with the space agency making recruitment and training films, and advocating for people such as astronaut Mae Jemison to reapply after rejection. Jemison, a longtime fan and friend of Nichols, was the first Black woman in space. “We’re going to do whatever we can make sure that there’s lasting change for not just Britney, not just Nichelle but everyone who is trapped in this corrupt system,” the Free Britney activist Kevin Wu told BuzzFeed News. The Free Nichelle campaigners are largely following the lead of 26-year-old Angelique Fawcette, a producer and actor who first met Nichols in 2012. Fawcette has several pictures and videos with Nichelle Nichols on her social media as proof of their close relationship and claims that she is carrying out Nichols’ wishes. Fawcette believes that Nichols does not need a conservatorship and is being abused by her son’s control of her finances. Fawcette has filed several petitions with the court seeking to end Nichols’ conservatorship, though the court has so far declined to intervene and recently ruled that Fawcette does not have standing to lodge her complaints. There is no question that Nichols suffers from dementia. Her diagnosis predates the conservatorship and as early as 2013, when Nichols was hospitalized for pancreatitis, there were indications that former manager Bell may have exercised an undue amount of influence to get Nichols to sign paperwork giving him power of attorney. In a GoFundMe established by her sister, Marian Nichols Smothers, her family alleges that after getting Nichols to grant him power of attorney, Bell transferred the deed on her home to himself in 2018, and that triggered the petition for conservatorship. (Bell, who allegedly first met Nichols in 2010, disputes these allegations and insists he was helping the star get back on her feet financially.) So, if Nichols has already been rescued from an abusive situation, why are fans protesting against her son acting as her conservator? Fawcette has filed suit claiming that Nichols doesn’t need a conservator, merely support in managing her affairs. She also alleges that Nichols’ son Kyle Johnson has isolated Nichols and acted against his mother’s wishes by selling her Woodland Hills home and moving her to New Mexico. Protesters are also concerned that Johnsonmay not be an adequate caregiver for his mother, which highlights a problem not only with the system of conservatorships, but also with the lack of other options for people who may not be capable of caring for themselves. Nichols, who suffered from a mild stroke in 2015, may not have retained the cognitive facilities that Fawcette remembers her having. When the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstone interviewed Nichols in 2016, one year after the stroke, she seemed to have largely bounced back, needing only some assistance from a live-in assistant/therapist. But there is no way to know if her good days still outweigh the bad ones or whether she meets the conservatorship’s requirement that a person “cannot care for himself or herself” and is unable to “meet their basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter”. However, given reports that Gilbert Bell attempted not only to take her house in 2018 but contemplated marrying her to prevent her son from having access, brief public appearances may not be the best indicators of Nichols’ capacity to care for herself. Elder care in America is very expensive in general, but memory care is exceptionally expensive, costing an average of $6,935 a month for a facility that specializes in structured care. In-home care, although cheaper, is still expensive, costing an average of $54,000 a year for a trained caregiver. It is unclear if Nichols had the funds for either option available, especially after the alleged financial abuses by Bell. Though he claims to have helped her make money, her family believes he stole hundreds of thousands from her under the guise of being her manager. Financial exploitation is one of the most common forms of elder abuse, and a common consequence is elders who are unable to age in place. Although Fawcette and Bell allege that the sale of the house was unnecessary, her son Kyle Johnson states that the proceeds of the sale are in an account to fund his mother’s care. Fawcette says she will continue to fight the case in New Mexico, where Nichols now lives. About 1.3m guardianship or conservatorship cases are active in the US, with assets of more than $50bn controlled by conservators. Laws vary from state to state but under many systems those living under conservatorship have almost no rights, with all decisions about their life made by the conservator. Laws around conservatorship are being reviewed in California, after the Spears case. Brian Maienschein, a Democratic assemblyman, is proposing a bill that will require that conservatorships are used only as a last resort and make conservatorships easier to end.",News/Science,‘Free Nichelle’: protesters want to liberate Star Trek actor Nichelle Nichols from conservatorship,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/26/star-trek-actor-nichelle-nichols-free-conservatorship
1/26/2022,"Before your child is born, you have their genome tweaked to boost their stature, build and intelligence. When they head to school, the teacher streams them according to their genetic makeup. And when working life begins, an employer checks their DNA to ensure they are healthy, agreeable and sufficiently extrovert for the role. It may sound like the worst science fiction. But a new government report warns that genomics is advancing so fast that such scenarios are plausibly on the horizon, with often few laws and regulations to prevent them.  To avoid genomic technologies causing harm to the public, pre-emptive action should be taken now, it says. “We are still in the infancy of understanding the complexity of genomic data but this is changing very rapidly,” said Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser. “Now is the time to consider what might be possible, and what actions government and the public could take.” The Government Office for Science consulted 30 experts on science, technology and policy before writing the Genomics Beyond Health report, a 198-page digest of where we are with genomic science and where the technology may take us. The report paints a rich picture of a genetics revolution driven by disease-resistant crops, net zero biofuels and hens that don’t peck one other to pieces. But the authors highlight a raft of ethical and practical issues, including how genomic technologies are already running ahead of scientific evidence and veering into dubious territory. A handful of firms offer genetic tests for IQ, for example, a trait that may be influenced by more than 1,000 genes and their interactions with the environment the person lives in. Other companies offer music playlists that claim to be inspired by customers’ “origins”. One controversial field of research aims to create “polygenic scores” that draw on multiple genes to predict how well a child will perform in education. If the predictions become reliable enough, they could help schools tailor their teaching for students with learning disabilities, the report states. But the authors go on to note that, today at least, parental education is a more accurate predictor of how well a child will perform. There are no regulations in the UK around the use of genomics in education and little to stop genomic testing firms from marketing the tests to parents, they add. A similar lack of legislation means UK employers are not prohibited from using genomic analysis when hiring. The situation leaves the door open for companies to select workers for optimal health, personality traits and even their likelihood of becoming injured in the workplace. “Unlike in the US, there is nothing explicit in UK legislation barring the use of genetic testing in job or candidate selection,” the authors write. More areas are due to be shaken up by genomics, the report explains. The criminal justice system may have to decide whether jurors should take into account a person’s genetic propensity for violence when deciding their fate. Meanwhile a shift from genetic fingerprinting to whole genome sequencing at crime scenes might allow police to issue a “predictive photofit” of the individual they want to find. Rather than screening sports stars for performance enhancing drugs, they may need to be checked for genetic upgrades. “There is a risk that future scientific and technological advances could further outpace existing regulation structures, raising the possibility of genomic technologies being misused and causing harm to UK citizens,” the report warns. “Proactive regulation that preempts the potential risks of future technologies would help to minimise risks and ensure that UK citizens are protected by law in terms of their genomic data privacy, anonymity, and data security.”",News/Science,UK government advisers call for ‘proactive regulation’ around genomics ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/26/uk-government-advisers-call-for-proactive-regulation-around-genomics
1/26/2022,"A documentary film about Alexei Navalny, who narrowly survived an apparent poisoning attempt with novichok, has premiered at the Sundance film festival. The 90-minute film, simply titled Navalny, features fly-on-the-wall footage of the Russian opposition leader, filmed during the several months he spent in Germany in late 2020 as he recovered from the poisoning. There are interviews with Navalny, his wife, Yulia, and his closest team.  The most extraordinary sequence of the film is when, from Navalny’s Black Forest recuperation hideout, he made a prank call to one of the hit squad he believes carried out the poisoning, and got him to reveal details about the hit by pretending to be an angry security services boss. “I remember just being like, ‘OK, make sure we’re rolling, keep it in focus. This is the most important thing you’ll ever film in your entire life,’” said director Daniel Roher in an interview with Hollywood Reporter about the moment of the telephone confession. “Afterward everyone was freaking out. We were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I was like, ‘Let’s offload the footage right now. Should we call the police? Do we need protection at the house?’” Roher was initially planning to make a film on a different topic with Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian investigator working for Bellingcat, the team of online sleuths and investigative journalists. However, after Navalny’s poisoning, Grozev began looking for clues about who might have been behind the hit. Having bought telephone and flight records on the Russian dark web, he found a group of eight men from the FSB security services who appeared to have been following Navalny on trips across Russia for several years. Grozev contacted Navalny and journeyed to Germany to meet with him and share the information he had found. Roher came with him and kept filming. It turned out Navalny and his team had already been thinking about making a film, and a collaboration began. “When Alexei woke up from his coma in Berlin, he had two visions. One was of doing this gigantic investigative video about Vladimir Putin’s palace and his illicit wealth. And the other was to do this big, in his mind, Hollywood documentary movie,” said Roher. Navalny fell ill in August 2020 while taking a plane from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. Thanks to the quick actions of the pilot, who made an emergency landing in Omsk, he did not die, and he was later transported to Berlin, where he made a long and slow recovery. The Kremlin has denied involvement in the poisoning and President Vladimir Putin has refused to say Navalny’s name in public, referring to him obliquely as “that gentlemen”, “a certain character” or “the Berlin patient”. The film closes with Navalny’s return to Russia in January 2021. He was detained on arrival at the airport and later sentenced to two years and eight months in prison, for supposedly violating the terms of his sentencing over a previous conviction for fraud that was widely seen as politically motivated. He is serving his sentence in a penal colony 60 miles east of Moscow. Since Navalny’s poisoning, his Anti-Corruption Foundation has been declared an extremist organisation and many of its leaders and regional coordinators have been forced to flee the country. The making of the film had been kept under wraps until earlier this month, and its presence on the Sundance programme was only publicised at the last minute. The premiere took place online on Tuesday evening, as this year’s Sundance is virtual due to Covid. Maria Pevchikh, a close associate of Navalny who was with him in Tomsk when he was poisoned, was the film’s executive producer. At the end of the film, Navalny answers a request from the director to record a message for the eventuality that he were killed on his return. “I’ve got something very obvious to tell you: don’t give up, you’re not allowed. If they decided to kill me, it means we are incredibly strong, and we need to use this power,” he said. In an Instagram post announcing the film, Navalny complained in his usual irreverent tone that the prison library where he is serving time does not have a subscription to HBO Max, so he will not be able to watch it.",News/World news,‘Everyone was freaking out’: Navalny novichok film made in secret premieres at Sundance ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/everyone-was-freaking-out-navalny-novichok-film-made-in-secret-premieres-at-sundance
1/26/2022,"It speaks to the scale of the challenge that, in the month that I set out to have more fun, my Christmas and new year plans are derailed by Covid; I am relieved of half my savings by a phone scammer; and a man I’m meeting for a first date suggests that maybe I am depressed. I get my money back, and my date is a supply chain consultant, not a doctor – but fun certainly seems like a faraway prospect.  I have been tasked with testing out the advice in The Power of Fun, a new book by the science journalist Catherine Price. Fun, she argues, is not something that’s nice to have, but actually essential to a happy, healthy life – and it’s possible to have more of it, even during a pandemic. I will admit that when Price and I first speak, the week before Christmas, I am sceptical. Omicron cases are surging, the official advice is to “deprioritise” socialising – and the sun goes down by 4pm. Meanwhile the back cover of Price’s book invites me to reflect: “When did you last feel exhilarated and lighthearted? When is the last time you felt fully alive?” I cast my mind back, and back, and back, to what feels like a different period in history. Maybe I am depressed – or maybe it’s just the pandemic. Simply living through the last two years is, for most of us, reason enough for an urgent “funtervention”, suggests Price. I had been steeling myself for our interview, anticipating the A-grade Pollyanna who would have the gall to exhort “the power of fun” through a deadly pandemic – but she’s delightful company: warm, knowledgable and reassuringly down to earth. She has been only too conscious of how her pitch might land, Price tells me over Skype. “The idea that ‘you should just have fun!’ – people are going to want to punch me in the face, you know?” She laughs. “The message I am really trying to get across is that if we think more seriously about what fun is … it can help us through this. This is what we need to focus on, if we want to make it through this next phase of the pandemic with our sanity intact.” Price points to the “broaden-and-build” theory of positive psychology that suggests positive emotions don’t just reflect resilience, wellbeing and health – they build it, helping us to endure future stress. Other research has suggested that, while some of our happiness is determined by our genes and circumstances – for example, living through a pandemic – as much as 40% may be in our control. That’s not to say that it is easy to influence: if fun is hard to summon or define at the best of times, it is surely more elusive than ever now. But to Price, that is all the more reason to prioritise it. There is an assumption that fun is effortless – “that your leisure time will just fill itself,” she says. “But unless you put effort into figuring out how you want to fill it, you risk having the feeling that Viktor Frankl described as ‘Sunday neurosis’ – when the void within yourself becomes manifest.” Frankl, a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, wrote in 1946 about the existential despair that descends at the end of the busy week. I am very familiar with that void, I tell Price, though I know it as “the abyss”. Sometimes friends and I describe our state of mind in relation to it, as: “inching closer to” or “on the very edge of”. I realise I am sounding depressed again but Price is sympathetic. “I’ve felt that through my life, but I’m happy to say that I don’t feel that so much now, and I really do think that’s a result of this project.” The goal, she says, is not nonstop fun, or even outstanding fun: “We’re just trying to add lightness, to take some steps to feel energised and alive.” Let’s see, she adds, how far away from the abyss she can take me. I hit a hurdle more or less immediately. I struggle to articulate what, exactly, “fun” is. It’s not necessarily watching Netflix, as anyone who has been caught out by their slack-jawed reflection in the “Are you still watching?” screen knows. Nor is it board games, if you can’t stand competition; or musical instruments, if you’re contentedly tin-eared. Everyone’s experience of fun – every experience of fun, even – is different, says Price. Many things that we ostensibly do “for fun” we may not even enjoy. She began her investigation into fun with her own experiences and those of her “Fun Squad”, a self-selecting global group of 1,500 people, recruited from Price’s mailing list. Between her own “life-affirming” experience of group guitar lessons and her correspondents’ recollections – of pastimes as varied as playing fetch with their dog, squishing through mud and sleepovers in school – Price identified three factors of real, restorative fun: playfulness, connection and flow. The confluence of the three she termed “true fun”: when we feel lighthearted, engaged with another person and absorbed by the activity. It’s possible to have fun if only one or two of the criteria are met, Price says – but highly unlikely if none are. By evaluating our time through those filters, we can crystallise our personal definition of fun and make space for more of it in our lives. We might need to lower our expectations, Price suggests. “People tend to think: ‘Go on a vacation! Have a big party!’ – but these things have been out of reach.” Aiming for the “true fun” trifecta presents “a way to think about the things that nourish us, and to figure out achievable things we can do, to make ourselves feel just a little bit more alive”. On Price’s advice I start small, noticing how and when I experience playfulness, connection and flow in a day. What doesn’t feel fun that should? And when am I taken by surprise? As I attune to my internal fun-meter, I find that I enjoy an hour of television, but see steeply reduced returns from there onwards – and the same goes for one to one-and-a-half glasses of wine. First dates can be fun, but wildly unpredictable. Twitter is hardly ever any fun at all. I score the trifecta by video-calling my sister in New Zealand, a perfect example of what Price calls a “microdose” of fun, which can be easily slotted into busy schedules. I’m struck by the fun I have making cannelloni: the minor challenge of a new recipe, the meditative act of stuffing the pasta. Eating all six portions by myself, over a week? Not so much. It quickly becomes clear that my most reliable “fun magnet” is connecting with other people, a challenge when I live alone and my friends have gone to ground over Christmas. But knowing that battery will be running down, I make more of an effort to be present and engaged as I go about shops and cafes. Those exchanges do make me feel lighter, and the world seem friendlier (apart from the phone scammer). Inspired by poet Ross Gay’s The Book of Delights – which included pecans and people calling him “sweetie” – Price started exchanging her own daily delights in a group chat with faraway friends. “And it really makes a difference.” I rope one of my reliable fun-magnet friends into doing the same, and his messages are a treat to receive. Mine describe some perfect cobwebs and a woman waving at me in my flat from the bus stop across the road. They are barely worth mentioning, but I am glad I did. It’s not just the pandemic working against us having more fun – it’s much of modern life. Playfulness, connection and flow are all notably active states – meaning that passive consumption, though enjoyable or relaxing, is unlikely to ever transport or restore us the way the best kind of fun can. “true fun” requires us to be present and at ease, not distracted, self-critical, stressed or sleep-deprived. For many of us, that’s a tall order. We may slump in front of screens every evening because we are too exhausted to consider anything else. (Price titles this chapter: “Why you feel dead inside”.) My first breakthrough in my “funtervention” is that I am simply not rested enough to be open to the idea. I had not grasped that, by getting less than eight hours’ sleep a night, I was eroding my capacity to enjoy my days. It is the prompt I need to introduce a proper bedtime routine and to charge my phone in another room overnight. By identifying rest as a prerequisite for pleasure, I prioritise it. (And I soon start zipping through novels like I used to do pre-smartphone.) For caregivers, of course, the challenge is much greater. Resentment is a “universal fun killer”, says Price. She suggests that the first step in creating the conditions for more fun might be ensuring that childcare and household chores are equally divided. I have already failed spectacularly at one of Price’s rules: “Don’t turn fun into work” – but so has she. As freelance writers, we both have form in “turning personal issues into professional projects”, as she puts it, with the end result being that it is hard to separate our lives from our jobs. I feel this acutely, having ditched all my hobbies – learning French, singing in a choir, playing guitar and darkroom photography (not to mention writing “for fun”) – at 17, when I started pursuing journalism in earnest. Now the closest I come is running and weightlifting: sources of flow and connection, but too close to “self-optimising” (to paraphrase writer Jia Tolentino) to be optimal fun. “We are all so out of practice, raised in this cult of productivity,” says Price. She suggests that I revisit some of those interests that I chucked for my career. As it turns out, I am cat-sitting over new year at a house that has an electric piano, and I spend a happy half-hour haltingly working out a Taylor Swift song. I’m so pleasingly ineffectual, it could only be for my own enjoyment. Even after a few weeks of small-scale experiments with fun, I am struck by how soon it starts to feel more natural and easy, to flow more freely. And I am perturbed to realise how much of the resistance was within me all along. Without being conscious of it, I had for a long time been orienting my days around what I couldn’t do because of the pandemic, or what I had to do for work. Levity, or even leisure, couldn’t get a look-in. The epigraph of Price’s book, from author Michael Lewis, proved to be perspicacious: “If you get into the habit of life not being fun, you start to not even notice.” For me, responsible for keeping only myself afloat, it is a relatively straightforward matter of creating space in my schedule and shifting my mindset so that daily delights can register. If they are thin on the ground, I will try to engineer one myself by calling a friend, going on a walk somewhere new or seeking out a stranger’s dog (fail-safe). For many other people, the challenge will be much harder to overcome, if not impossible. As Price acknowledges, food, shelter, adequate rest and physical safety are prerequisites for fun: in the case of poverty, job insecurity, sickness and abuse, it may be irrelevant. But still, I think, she is right to urge us to try, in whatever way we can. Compared with other approaches to self-care and protecting your mental health, seeking to have more fun is accessible and instantly rewarding. That is what Price appreciates about fun, she says. “It turns this thing you ‘should’ do for some future pay-off into something that you want to do, because it’s enjoyable right then, in the moment.” And it is true that – after only a few weeks of looking to have more fun, without even trying very hard – I do notice the difference. The abyss is there. But I’m more at ease with it.  The Power of Fun is published by Bantam Press, price £14.99. To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
