12/13/2021,"Mikel Arteta has had his fill when it comes to off-pitch issues at Arsenal, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has given him another. We only know one side of the story but the manager’s position is that Aubameyang returned late from a trip abroad and, not for the first time, violated one or more of his “non-negotiables”. Arteta was already grappling with his captain’s dwindling goal output to the extent that Aubameyang was benched at Everton last Monday. Now he must consider whether dropping him from the squad that convincingly beat Southampton is sufficient punishment. Arsenal’s inconsistent young team need better leadership from their senior players, a theme yet to be consigned to history despite Arteta’s efforts, and there must be huge question marks over the 32-year-old’s status as captain now. Nick Ames  Match report: Arsenal 3-0 Southampton It’s now 26 matches and counting since Watford’s last clean sheet in a Premier League match – that 3-0 victory over Liverpool on 29 February 2020 under Nigel Pearson. In the hope that they don’t have to wait until the next leap year to achieve another, Claudio Ranieri has promised his players a meal out for every clean sheet they can manage. They came within six minutes of getting one against Brentford on Friday before conceding two late goals. Unfortunately for Emmanuel Dennis, who scored his seventh goal of the season, his steak is on ice for a while longer. “I walked up to him [Ranieri] after the Manchester United game and said, ‘you need to pay for dinner,’ and he said, ‘it wasn’t a clean sheet!’,” said the striker. “I said, ‘you’re lucky but we’ll try next week to keep a clean sheet so you can pay for dinner’. A very expensive one.” Ed Aarons Match report: Brentford 2-1 Watford Michail Antonio has been a revelation after his reinvention. He was the league’s joint top-scorerearly in the season but he is now on an eight-game goal drought in all competitions. It is worth noting that the former winger and wing-back, yet to score more than 10 goals in a top-flight season, is the lone senior striker at a club who stand a genuine chance of securing a top-four finish. If there is a question what Antonio can be expected to do – is his ceiling 15 goals? 20? – it also illustrates the importance of buying in January. Failing to score at Burnley should not be attributed just to him on a day when only Declan Rice excelled, but it was the sort of scrappy game a professional penalty-box predator might have won. Richard Jolly Match report: Burnley 0-0 West Ham Chelsea have scored three goals in their last two games, but there is still no sign of a clear identity in attack. The European champions are not like Manchester City and Liverpool; it is rare for them to blow organised teams away. Creating clear chances often feels like a slog and it should be a worry that Chelsea’s most effective attacker during their victory over Leeds was Antonio Rüdiger, who won both Jorginho’s second-half penalties. Indeed, there was not much of a celebration from Thomas Tuchel when the Italian sealed the win in added time. Even Chelsea’s first goal against Leeds, crisply converted by Mason Mount, only came when they won possession high up the pitch and caught Marcelo Bielsa’s side out of shape. Otherwise it was too predictable. The title is likely to prove out of reach if Chelsea cannot sharpen their cutting edge. Jacob Steinberg Match report: Chelsea 3-2 Leeds When Richarlison was taken off just before the hour mark at Crystal Palace, he looked disgruntled by the decision. The Brazilian had offered very little in the time he spent on the pitch, thanks to a mixture of good defending and Everton’s incredibly defensive style of play. After making his way to the back of the dugout, he settled in for a good sulk, even when Everton got back into the game thanks to his replacement, Salomón Rondón. Lucas Digne has missed the past two games for apparent off-field reasons, a sign that not everything is right at a club who have now won once in 10 matches. The cracks are showing before a crucial period for a frustrated group of players. With significant January investment unlikely, Benítez needs his best assets onside or they could face an even more troubling second half of the season. Will Unwin  Match report: Crystal Palace 3-1 Everton It was difficult to look beyond James Maddison for Leicester’s star turn in the 4-0 win over Newcastle given the quality of his play, particularly the outside-of-the-boot pass that led to his team’s second goal, scored by Patson Daka. But pulling the strings a little further back was Youri Tielemans. The midfielder returned from a month-long injury lay-off in Thursday’s Europa League defeat at Napoli and he cut loose here. There were the two goals, both lashed high into the net – the first from the penalty spot – but as pleasing for the manager, Brendan Rodgers, was the vision and accuracy of his passing together with his work without the ball. It was Tielemans’ pressure that led to the turnover for the opening goal and there would be a crucial defensive header to keep Newcastle out at 1-0. No Leicester player made more tackles. It was the complete performance. David Hytner Match report: Leicester 4-0 Newcastle Ambition dominated Steven Gerrard’s thoughts following his Anfield return and the second defeat of his Aston Villa reign. Could his team have shown more in a game that Liverpool dominated but finished nervously after the introductions of Danny Ings, Emiliano Buendía and Morgan Sanson by the visitors? “You can go too gung-ho too early against the top sides and get hit for a big scoreline,” the Villa manager pondered. “But I’ll look at myself and whether I should have done it earlier.” Five games in, the new Villa manager is already thinking ahead to days when his team start on the front foot at places such as Anfield. “I want the players and people at the club to be as ambitious as myself,” he added. “I am not saying my ambitions are different to theirs, but we won’t settle for anything except trying to improve. It is still early days but we have seen enough to believe we can take this club forward, finish the season in a positive position and build.” Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 1-0 Aston Villa Following another underwhelming performance by Jack Grealish against Wolves, Pep Guardiola defended his £100m signing while admitting he must add to the two goals and three assists he has recorded in all competitions for Manchester City this season. “One day it will unlock and he’ll score or he’ll make a goal,” said the manager. “Jack is a player whose decision-making is really good. In the final third he has to do it [better], but it will come. When you are a forward and the other team plays with 10 players or nine players in the box [as against Wolves] it’s so difficult. When one team doesn’t want to play – always it’s so difficult.” That is all fair but what is undeniable is that Grealish, having arrived from Aston Villa at great expense, is yet to truly sparkle for City. Jamie Jackson  Match report: Manchester City 1-0 Wolves Twenty minutes into a sodden Saturday evening fixture Dean Smith had problems. Grant Hanley’s shoulder had popped and, despite a valiant attempt to continue, his night was done. With an already patched-up defence, Smith turned to the utility man Jacob Sørensen. Having joined from Esbjerg last summer, the Dane appeared 32 times in Norwich’s Championship title run. All bar one of his 20 league starts came as a stand-in left-back. The exception was a rare outing in his preferred defensive midfield role, which is where his 10 previous Premier League minutes had come. A natural fit to come on at right-centre back against Manchester United, then. But Sørensen was not fazed. His four blocks and five interceptions were both team highs, while eight successful presses were bettered only by Josh Sargent. Even faced with Cristiano Ronaldo’s stepovers, Sørensen remained unmoved. His efforts embodied a valiant display by the hosts, even if they came away empty-handed. Sam Dalling Match report: Norwich 0-1 Manchester United The margins are often very small at the highest level of the professional game, and Saturday summed this up perfectly. Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United all won thanks to a penalty. Many will shout about conspiracies and big-club bias but it is actually just the nature of modern football, where better teams with deeper squads dominate matches and tire out the opposition. They spend more time in the box, ultimately giving them greater chance of earning a spot-kick once defenders make mistakes. The call for handball against João Moutinho was questionable but justifiable, and few could argue with the others. None of the victorious teams were at their best on Saturday but still spent most of their matches on top – United’s possession level was the lowest of the four at 54%. Even if all four sides can perhaps count themselves lucky to win, luck is another thing teams need to be successful.

12/13/2021,"Because of my Welsh upbringing, it’s probably Ar Lan y Môr – the classic Welsh nursery rhyme that all kids sing in the playgrounds. Every Welsh kid knows it.  I think it was [a reissue of] Bat Out of Hell by Meat Loaf when I was about seven, which I bought with some Christmas money from Virgin or Our Price – if you remember those music stores – in town in Cardiff. I don’t do karaoke that often, but if I wanted to nail it, probably Mustang Sally by Wilson Pickett. I used to sing it with a soul band at school and then in a funk band called the Classic Soul Dogs, so I actually know the song really well. I Just Want to Dance by Sault is an absolute banger. If you play that to anyone, they just have to love it. There’s this brilliant Cardiff band called Boy Azooga. There’s a song called Waitin’ on their debut album 1, 2 Kung Fu!, that I absolutely love. Dave, the singer, plays drums on my album. He’s super talented, and Boy Azooga are amazing. I can’t wait to hear more of their stuff. I really secretly like Lay All Your Love on Me by Abba. There’s nothing wrong with liking a bit of Abba – but not in every circle. Growing up, Everybody (Backstreet’s Back) by the Backstreet Boys was drummed into my head. The other day, I was on the beach in west Wales, one of my mates put it on, and I was like: “What are you doing?” I was so angry. I’m not answering that in case my mum is reading! Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division. The production and structure are just perfect. I’ve thought long and hard about this over the years. I’d start with Highway to Hell by AC/DC, then go into for Mozart’s Requiem in D Minor. And you have to listen to the whole thing, or else I’ll come back and haunt you.

12/13/2021,"It is funny how times change. The Guardian has obtained a letter, written in 2003 by Dr Richard Budgett, in which he discusses the consequences of trans women competing in women’s sport. Responding to a government inquiry, Budgett, then at the British Olympic Association, states: “The effect of allowing male transsexuals to compete as women would be to make competition unfair and potentially dangerous in some sports and would undermine women’s sports.” This would have been an interesting answer at the time. It is even more so now. Society has shifted. Language has changed. Budgett is now medical and scientific director at the International Olympic Committee. And his views, according to IOC sources, have evolved – particularly when it comes to finding ways to balance the need for inclusion and fairness in sport. A controversial new IOC framework, drawn up in part by Budgett, adopts a strikingly different stance. While stressing that men’s and women’s competition should be “fair and safe”, it also tells sports that, “until evidence determines otherwise”, trans athletes “should not be deemed to have an unfair or disproportionate competitive advantage”.  Yet the ink had barely dried on that framework document when the US college swimmer Lia Thomas caused a fresh splash in the debate. For her first three years at the University of Pennsylvania the 22‑year‑old swam as a male competitor, making six Ivy League swimming finals though not setting the world alight. But in the past month, competing as a trans woman after taking hormone replacement therapy to lower her testosterone, she has swum the fastest 200- and 500‑yard times in the US this year. That, though, tells only half the story. Thomas’s 200‑yard time of 1:41:93 ranks as the 17th fastest of all time – less than three seconds off the five‑time Olympic medallist Missy Franklin’s US record of 1:39:10. Meanwhile her 500‑yard time of 4:34:06 puts her 21st in history and within striking distance of a record set by Katie Ledecky, who is widely regarded as the greatest female swimmer in the sport’s history. All roads now lead to the NCAA championships in March, where Thomas could become swimming’s first transgender All-American champion. It will be a significant moment for sport – and for Thomas, who last week stressed how important it was for her to swim as her “authentic self” and praised the IOC for “promoting inclusivity while keeping competition integrity going”. Others, though, are less happy. According to reports, Thomas’s teammates were “in tears” with one explaining: “They feel so discouraged because no matter how much work they put in it, they’re going to lose.” Meanwhile Swimming World magazine’s John Lohn said he was uneasy that Ledecky’s record was under threat. “Simply, she is an icon who changed what was perceived to be attainable,” he wrote. “The fact that Thomas could break the record of such a once‑in‑a‑generation athlete confirms the biological advantages she possesses, and their power,.” Thomas’s surge to the top of the rankings also poses questions of the IOC and NCAA. Remember the female category exists because the performance gap between elite men and elite women is so stark. It starts at around 10%-13% for running and swimming and rises thereafter. That is why most sports require trans women to suppress their testosterone to compete in the female category. Recent studies, though, suggest that significant strength and muscular advantages remain even after hormone therapy. Thomas’s performances appear to back that up. Before transitioning, she was not a serious challenge to male records but is now swimming only 2.6% slower than the current 200‑yard female record. It means, as the developmental biologist Dr Emma Hilton points out, Thomas has gained a significant ranking advantage from switching category. Is this unfair? In 2003 Budgett thought so. As he put it in his letter: “The BOA believes the effect of allowing transsexuals to compete in their acquired sex would be to make competition unfair for women. The physique determined by two or more decades of life as a male would not be significantly changed (in the case of male to female transsexuals) which would eradicate the concept of a level playing field.” Some will argue that sport is never truly fair, that Michael Phelps’s big wingspan gave him genetic advantages too. But male puberty provides such a categorical advantage – in terms of muscle mass, strength, lean body mass and bone density – that it far exceeds the advantage of a few centimetres in arm length. No magic bullet, no one-size-fits-all policy can satisfy all sides. The issue involves competing rights and strong emotions. Worryingly a recent UK Sports Councils Equality Group report also found that women in sport were told to keep quiet by their national governing bodies and feared abuse on social media if they voiced their opinions. Yet perhaps times are changing. At the Sport Resolutions dispute resolution service last week several experts were able to discuss openly and courteously what sports should do next. It made for fascinating listening. For David Grevemberg, of the Centre for Sport and Human Rights, inclusion mattered most. And if sport had to radically change, then it should. “Are there ways, that are not infringing on human rights, to create a level playing field?” he asked. “Are there other conditions that we can create – for example staggered starts in the 100m? Or delayed starts?” Meanwhile Joanna Harper, a visiting fellow at Loughborough University and a trans woman, argued for a similar approach to the IOC’s 2015 guidance but with trans women required to reduce their testosterone to below five nmol/L for at least 12 months. She said the advantages were “small enough that trans women and cis women can have equitable and meaningful sport”. However, for Dr Nicola Williams, a spokeswoman for Fair Play For Women, the best solution would be for men to “budge up and be more inclusive” by allowing trans women and trans men into an open or universal category, with a separate category exclusively preserved for natal females. Whatever your view, one thing is clear: this issue is not going away. And Thomas’s groundbreaking performances have only made that clearer to Richard Budgett, the IOC and the rest of us.",Sport/Sport,"Sport’s trans issue is here to stay.

12/13/2021,"A real estate agent in Queensland has come under fire after it emailed tenants offering them the chance to buy a Christmas gift for their landlords. The real estate agency, Kanik & Co, located near Brisbane, sent out an email to tenants offering to facilitate the purchasing of select gifts, along with any “handwritten notes”, that would be delivered to the owner of the property.  Some of the offered gifts include a $50 “white wine grazing box”, a $55 “festive sweets basket”, a $70 “self care hamper”, a $99 “foodies hamper” and a $115 gift called “all things golden”. “This year has been particularly challenging for both our tenants and property owners alike, and we understand some tenants would like to thank their property owner for everything in 2021,” the agency wrote in the email. “The choice to be involved is 100% optional and you are certainly under no obligation to do so.” The offer was criticised by some online, with Twitter user Sinéad Canning sharing a screenshot of the email saying “the time has come to lick their boots harder”. “This agency is in Logan, where the average weekly rent has increased by 30 per cent in the last 5 years and the vacancy rate is 1 per cent,” she wrote. Landlords have seen their passive incomes increase at your expense this year. The time has come to lick their boots harder. pic.twitter.com/mhZuB1QJUj The City of Logan released a report into housing in 2020, and found that Logan had a higher proportion of households in both mortgage and rental stress compared to south-east Queensland. “Housing affordability is a growing concern for Logan households and many families experience housing stress,” the report found. A separate report from Deloitte and the state government found that rental prices in Logan had increased by 4.1% from March 2020 – March 2021. It also found 7.3% increases in Brisbane, 9.8% increases in the Gold Coast and 16% increases in the Sunshine Coast. Director at Kanik & Co, Michael Kanik, told Guardian Australia his agency apologised for any offence caused, saying a similar email was also sent to landlords wanting to send gifts to their tenants. He said it was not meant with any ill will, and that it was “just something nice”. “Each tenant and landlord is unique, and some of them wanted to thank their landlords, and wanted us to help us facilitate it.” “We can see where some of the criticism has come from, rent is obviously increasing across the board, but not all landlords are the same, some don’t want to increase prices.” “We had tenants or landlords reach out, wanting to trade Christmas gifts and cards, and wanted us to facilitate it. We just wanted to do a nice thing, that’s all.”",News/Australia news,Tenants asked to consider buying their landlords a Christmas present – despite increase in rents,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/tenants-asked-to-consider-buying-their-landlords-a-christmas-present-despite-increase-in-rents
12/13/2021,"The Morrison government has urged MPs and senators to dob in the Climate 200 fund and “Voices for” independent advocacy groups under new rules that may require them to reveal their donors. The government, with Labor’s support, this month passed amendments to electoral laws that will force entities to register as “significant third parties” if they spend more than $250,000 on electoral expenditure a year.  The law also expands the definition of electoral expenditure to include any spending “in relation to an election”, so that expenses like campaign staff and offices can trigger the requirement to register. The special minister of state, Ben Morton, wrote to all federal parliamentarians on Monday suggesting MPs contact the Australian Electoral Commission asking it to remind “organisations that could even slightly meet [the] criteria” of their new obligations to register. It comes as the Australia Institute launches a campaign to repeal the changes, with new polling finding 60% of Australians agree that advocating for policy change is an important part of the work that charities do, and only 15% oppose. In an email on Monday, Morton wrote the new laws will mean “activist organisations seeking to influence election outcomes will no longer be able to shroud their electoral income in secrecy, and will face tough rules that ban foreign donations from influencing Australian elections”. Morton complained that “new entities have been established with the sole or dominant purpose of acting as political fundraising vehicles”. “Many of these funding vehicles hide in the dark – they were established with the explicit goal of avoiding electoral funding disclosure,” he said. “Potentially impacted groups that you may be aware of in your local community include ‘voices of (electorate)’, ‘(electorate) independents’, ‘vote (Name) out’, ‘Climate 200’ and other organisations that are fundraising for or expending electoral expenditure.” Morton noted the bill will soon get royal assent and “many organisations” will need to register “the day after”, including Voices groups. “If an entity is required to register as a significant third party, they will not be able to spend or fundraise for the purpose of incurring electoral expenditure until they register.” The law also includes penalties of up to $44,400 for failure to register. “These reforms strengthen the integrity of Australia’s electoral system,” Morton said. “This isn’t about stopping organisations from being able to advocate. This is about transparency for organisations trying to influence voters in an election.” The charities sector is concerned the political campaigner law will mean charities, unions, climate and environment groups will have to declare all their donors, even if their issues-based advocacy is only tangentially related to the election. Labor passed the laws as part of a deal that included the Coalition agreeing to drop the controversial voter identification bill. Labor’s Andrew Leigh has said the opposition only passed the laws for fear the crossbench could wave them through, and has committed “revisit” the framework if elected to government. The Australia Institute has called for the laws to be repealed, citing retrospectivity that will require registration for past spending, and the “vague” definition of electoral expenditure. It is concerned that organisations that spend just a fraction of their receipts on electoral expenditure will be captured, bringing more extensive reporting requirements and limits on international philanthropy. Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said “advocacy is an important part of the work charities do, and our research shows the majority of Australians agree”. Oquist said the “attack on charities” was the result of “a bad process”, with late amendments and no Senate inquiry scrutiny of unintended consequences. “There has been no notice, little public explanation, no sector consultation,” he said. “We have just witnessed the biggest attack on the Australian charity sector the public has never heard of.”",News/Australia news,Morrison government urges MPs to dob in climate and ‘Voices for’ groups under new donor rules,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/morrison-government-urges-mps-to-dob-in-climate-and-voices-for-groups-under-new-donor-rules
