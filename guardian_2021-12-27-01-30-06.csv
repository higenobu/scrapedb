12/27/2021,"Typical: Christmas evening, you turn on the television and it’s another bloody repeat. Although in fairness to England, pick through the dental records of their latest Ashes capitulation and you might just be able to identify a few distinguishing features. And above all the defining quality of their Boxing Day fiasco at Melbourne was the sense of hopelessness and predestination: of a team and a generation whose narrative arc has finally run dry. There was a time when England collapses had a kind of fascinating car-crash quality to them. These days, by contrast, they feel strangely banal: tedious, overfamiliar, predictable, like a recurring anxiety dream. The openers disappear early. Joe Root does something pointless and defiant. All of a sudden you’re back at your old school. Someone in the middle order plays a stupid shot. You turn over the exam paper, but there’s nothing on it. The No 9 hits an insolent 25. Suddenly you realise you’re totally naked. James Anderson walks off the field, nought not out. You wake, breathless and more tired than when you went to bed.  It takes some effort to make your biggest encounter of all feel like a trite inconsequence, but somehow this England have managed it. Has a live series ever felt more dead? Have two theoretically well-matched teams (just look at the world rankings; Australia and England are separated by just a single point) ever produced such a calamitous mismatch? Has an England middle order ever played three worse shots than the shots Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow produced on the first afternoon of the third Test? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Certainly there were few expectations when Root departed shortly after lunch to leave England 82 for four, a familiar quandary. Yet as Stokes and Bairstow launched a squally counter-attack, other futures briefly presented themselves. Twenty-eight runs came in the seven overs before drinks, including a huge six by Stokes off Nathan Lyon. All of a sudden, an opening. The ball was ageing. England were one good, solid hour from rebalancing the game. At which point Cameron Green returned to the attack, hanging the ball outside off stump, accumulating dots, daring Stokes to play the big shot. Lyon bowled very straight with a tight leg-side field, accumulating dots, daring Bairstow to play the big shot. Six overs cost just five runs. Has a plan ever been simpler or more transparent? In a way, those next few overs were England’s last few years in microcosm. You hit a rough patch, and you either endure or you flip out and do the bad thing. And over the last four or five years England have essentially turned doing the bad thing into a sort of performance art. Stokes had already tried to upper-cut Green over the slips a few overs earlier and narrowly escaped. Hey, why not try it again? After he had steered the ball meekly to gully, Buttler arrived and immediately seemed to lose heart. His second ball jagged back and bounced over his stumps. Mitchell Starc got one to leap off a length. Pat Cummins got one to die a little. And so, in the last over before tea, with the score 128 for five and Mark Wood the next man in, Buttler hit the ejector seat. It was a terrible shot. It would have been a terrible shot even if he’d nailed Lyon into the crowd for six. It was the shot you play when your conscious brain is too tired to compute the knotted logistics of staying in, and the id simply takes over. It was the shot of a man out of form and out of rhythm, who in fatigue and desperation had convinced himself that he could regain his form and rhythm with one sweet contact. Bairstow at least had the excuse of batting with the tail, but in trying to cut a ball from Starc that was on about leg-stump, he too deserves his share of ignominy. There is a theory out there that these are simply bad players, who have proved it again and again over time. But talent is a dynamic thing. Success is not a straight line. Players improve and learn and founder and regress and there is nothing inevitable about any of it. On talent alone, Stokes-Bairstow-Buttler could have been one of the all-time great England middle-orders. An axis upon which an entire era could have been built. Given defined roles in a confident team, they won a World Cup final pretty much on their own. Instead, this series feels like the end of the road for them as a trio. Haunted in the field and hounded with the bat, Buttler looks in desperate need of a break, perhaps even a permanent break. Stokes looks physically and mentally undercooked. Bairstow is surely on the last of his last chances. All three are over 30 and nearer the end than the beginning. And for all they have achieved together with a white ball, with a red ball the feeling of loss is inescapable: a promise not fulfilled, three pristine talents misused, mismanaged and forsaken.",Sport/Sport,England capitulations have gone from car-crash to commonplace,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/26/england-capitulations-have-gone-from-car-crash-to-commonplace
12/27/2021,"From the moment he resigned from his post as a schoolteacher rather than comply with the orders of the racist, repressive apartheid regime in South Africa in 1958, Desmond Tutu never deviated from his principles, fighting for tolerance, equality and justice at home and abroad. This brought him love, influence and a moral prestige equalled by few others on the African continent or beyond. But Tutu, the cleric and activist who died on Sunday in Cape Town aged 90, was not just outspoken in support of the causes he felt to be right – such as LGBT rights – but a fierce and implacable opponent of what he felt to be wrong. Criticism was often tempered with humour. On occasion it was delivered straight. This earned him enemies, and still does.  Tutu’s first and most famous enemy was the apartheid system that prevailed in his homeland from 1948. Fully engaged in the freedom struggle from the late 1970s, Tutu was a key figure in telling the rest of the world about the grievances of South Africa’s exploited majority communities. The cleric and activist, branded a “rabble-rouser” by authorities, did not pull his punches. Apartheid was as bad as “nazism”, he told the United Nations in 1988, adding that politicians in the west who failed to support sanctions campaigns against the regime in Pretoria were racists. “We don’t want to drive the white people into the sea, we don’t want to destroy white people,” said Tutu, who won the Nobel peace prize in 1984 for his nonviolent efforts to end apartheid and avoid devastating conflict in South Africa. “But is it too much to ask that in the land of our birth, we walk tall as human beings made in the image of God? ... To say we want to be free?” In a letter, Tutu, then head of the South African Council of Churches, informed Margaret Thatcher in 1984 that a British invitation to the South African prime minister to visit the UK was “a slap in the face of millions of black South Africans who are the daily victims of one of the most vicious policies in the world.” But he did not spare those in power in the “rainbow nation” that emerged after South Africa’s first free election in 1994. The phrase was his own, and set up aspirations that were never fulfilled. A decade later, Tutu gave a high-profile lecture in which he listed the many achievements of his countrymen under democracy but implied that many came despite their new political rulers who sought their own advancement before that of the poor. “What is black empowerment when it seems to benefit not the vast majority but a small elite that tends to be recycled? Are we not building up much resentment that we may rue later? We are sitting on a powder keg,” Tutu said. The Nobel laureate’s criticism of the ruling African National Congress party became even harsher during the tenure of President Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic corruption and maladministration. Relations between the ANC and Tutu improved slightly after Cyril Ramaphosa, a former labour activist and tycoon who has sought to bring in moderate reform and fight graft, took power. Ramaphosa’s tribute on Sunday – with its reference to the passing of “a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa” underlines the general sense of disillusionment with their successors and it will be the Anglican church that will organise the former archbishop’s funeral, according to Covid restrictions currently in force as South Africa battles its fourth wave of infections, not the government. Even now, some Zuma loyalists have distanced themselves from the outpouring of grief and tributes. One reason is the memory of the cleric’s rigorous and personally harrowing leadership of South Africa’s truth and reconciliation commission, which investigated apartheid-era crimes to bring closure to victims and the nation. Tutu’s commitment and determination did not just anger supporters of the white officials constrained to disclose the depredations of the apartheid regime. The council’s investigation of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela’s former wife, for the abduction and eventual murder of a teenager still rankles. On social media on Sunday, some called Tutu a “stooge for white people”. In reality, Tutu took aim at exploiters and autocrats anywhere he found them. Justly lauded as an icon of nonviolent activism, he enraged those who prefer less pacific means to effect change or hold on to power. Robert Mugabe, the former dictatorial leader of Zimbabwe, resorted to insults to counter Tutu’s cutting words, calling their author “an angry, evil and embittered little bishop”. Such sentiments did not bother the smiling, chuckling, charismatic cleric – though Tutu confessed to one interviewer that he “loved to be loved”. Even in the Anglican church, an institution to which he dedicated much of his life, Tutu’s liberal understanding of faith riled many. No one doubted his faith or commitment to the institution but not every cleric enjoyed hearing about a God who had a “soft spot for sinners” and fewer still on a continent riven by visceral homophobia appreciated his vocal, consistent support for LBGT rights. “I would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply I feel about this,” he said in 2013. “I would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven. No, I would say, ‘Sorry, I would much rather go to the other place.’” He also supported the right to assisted death, another controversial position within the church. Other interventions argued for urgent action against climate change and a change in US policy on Israel. Right to the end Tutu was “on the side of the angels”, as one resident of a township not far from where the archbishop lived and died said on Sunday. In one of his last public appearances, aged 89, he received a Covid vaccine, an important statement in a country that has lost up to 250,000 lives to the pandemic out of a population of 59m, according to excess mortality figures https://www.samrc.ac.za/reports/report-weekly-deaths-south-africa?bc=254, and suffers from widespread vaccine hesitancy. Analysts predict a battle over Tutu’s legacy as South African political factions jostle to claim they are the true heirs of “the Arch”, as he was familiarly known. For the moment though, there is profound grief at the loss of the country’s “moral compass” and a genuine sense of bereavement. “South Africa and the world has lost one its greatest parents and role models. [Tutu] was abnormally imbued with a sense of pastoral duty to serve the best interests of his species – the human family – and planet,” a statement from the office of the archbishop of Cape Town said. “To do the right thing. To make people feel part. To advance justice, humanness, peace and joy … His work is not done; it is in our hands now.”",News/World news,South Africa set for battle over legacy of ‘moral compass’ Desmond Tutu,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/south-africa-battle-legacy-moral-compass-desmond-tutu
12/27/2021,"Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley’s retail group is reported to have tabled an offer to buy Footasylum, the trainer retailer that rival JD Sports has been instructed to sell by the competition regulator. The offer is the latest development in a running battle between Ashley’s Frasers Group and JD Sports over access to the best goods from key suppliers, such as Nike and Adidas, as well as the attention of shoppers.  JD Sports was ordered to sell Footasylum’s 65 stores by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in November, after the watchdog ruled that JD’s purchase of the smaller chain of trainer shops would result in a worse deal for shoppers. The regulator must approve the new purchaser to ensure it is a truly independent competitor – unless JD Sports successfully appeals against the ruling. Frasers, which owns the House of Fraser department stores and luxury streetwear retailer Flannels as well as Sports Direct, has notified the CMA of its plan to make an offer, according to a report in the Sunday Times. At the time of the CMA’s decision, JD said the regulator blocking its merger with Footasylum “defies logic”. Peter Cowgill, the executive chair of JD, has also suggested that the decision was influenced by his key competitor. Last year, in a veiled reference to Sports Direct, he said: “Incredibly, the CMA has been taken in by the self-serving testimony of one notoriously vocal competitor, who has made numerous public announcements.” He said that competitor had “blatantly participated in the process for their own commercial interests rather than for the benefit of consumers”. The Bury-based retail group agreed to buy Footasylum in March 2019 for £90m, but the deal has been caught in a tortuous process since then, with the CMA repeatedly trying to block it. JD declined to comment and Frasers did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Business,Frasers Group reportedly offers to buy Footasylum,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/26/frasers-group-reportedly-offers-to-buy-footasylum
