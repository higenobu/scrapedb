4/8/2022,"A former medal-winning Paralympian footballer has been banned from being a trustee by the charities watchdog after an investigation found a disability sports charity he founded paid £1m raised by the public to companies run by him and his wife. The Charity Commission said Matt Dimbylow, 51, who represented the GB seven-a-side football team in the 2008 and 2012 Paralympics, and was a Paralympic World Cup medal-winner, was guilty of serious misconduct and abusing public trust. Of £6m raised for the charity Dream It Believe It Achieve It (DIBIAI) through a lottery scratchcard scheme, £1m was paid to companies run by Dimbylow and his wife, Emma Dimbylow, the commission found. A further £4.2m went on fundraising costs, including payments to an unnamed private lottery operator. Just £300,000 was spent on charitable purposes. “The public expects trustees to ensure charitable funds are always carefully managed in the best interests of their charity and the cause they serve, in this case supporting children and disabled people with sport. Instead, the Dimbylows abused the trust that was placed in them as trustees,” said the Charity Commission’s head of investigations, Amy Spiller. The commission concluded there had been significant breaches of trust at the charity, while its failure to tackle conflicts of interest had led to the pair enjoying “substantial unauthorised financial benefit” that was not in the charity’s best interests. Dimbylow – described as the “driving force” at the DIBIAI – was banned permanently from being a trustee, while Emma Dimbylow signed an agreement promising not to act as a trustee again. The charity is in the process of being wound up, and any remaining funds will be given to another disability sports charity. Matt Dimbylow became involved in the Paralympian game after a head injury in 2003 triggered a Parkinson’s-like brain condition. He also captained the England cerebral palsy football team and was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame alongside Alan Shearer, Michael Owen and Patrick Vieira in 2013. He registered the charity the same year, and the commission concluded he planned to “extract funds from it”. It said it stepped in early on to prevent him, as a trustee, from paying himself an £80,000 salary. He subsequently amended the charity’s governing document to enable it to pay companies owned by himself and his wife. The commission began formally investigating the charity in 2017, and Matt Dimbylow was removed as a trustee two years later. Some of the funds paid by the charity to the Dimbylows’ companies were subsequently recovered by the commission through the courts. While the inquiry was ongoing, the commission said it took action to restrict more than 30 bank accounts held in the charity’s name to stop payments being made without the regulator’s approval. Although the charity fundraising regulator looked into the actions of the lottery operator, no action was taken. The watchdog criticised two other unnamed trustees of the charity, who it said were insufficiently independent and failed to hold the Dimbylows to account for their actions. “Their lack of oversight and scrutiny created an environment where the charity’s funds could be misapplied,” the commission concluded. The commission said it hoped its regulatory action against DIBIAI “sends a powerful message to others who may be tempted to use charity in this way”. Matt Dimbylow and DIBIAI were approached for comment.",News/Society,Ban for former Paralympian whose charity paid £1m to family companies,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/07/ban-for-former-paralympian-whose-charity-paid-1m-to-family-companies
4/8/2022,"Police have raided an office in the headquarters of one of the UK’s biggest unions as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery, money laundering and fraud. More than 20 officers from South Wales police arrived unannounced on Wednesday at the offices of Unite in Holborn, central London. Police took away a number of items including documentation, notebooks and a computer. The raid was part of a joint inquiry by the south Wales force and HM Revenue and Customs. Officers also executed warrants in the South Wales, Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and Northamptonshire police areas. A Unite spokesperson said: “A Unite employee is subject to a criminal investigation by the police. On Wednesday 6 April the employee’s office at Unite HQ, in Holborn London, was accessed and searched by the police under warrant.” Unite was Labour’s most generous donor under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the party. In December its new general secretary, Sharon Graham, said she planned to cut donations to Labour and divert the money to union campaigns. Graham, who was elected in August, has launched an inquiry into how the building costs of a hotel and conference centre in Birmingham spiralled into a “potentially significant loss” for the union. The initial projected cost for the 170-room complex was £57m, but the cost soared to £98m, an increase Unite said was a result of safeguarding employment practices onsite. A police spokesperson said: “South Wales police has executed warrants as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery, fraud and money laundering. The warrants were executed on Wednesday 6 April at addresses in the South Wales, Metropolitan, Merseyside, Cheshire, north Wales, Dyfed Powys and Northamptonshire police force areas. “The joint investigation with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is continuing and a number of suspects will be interviewed in due course.”",News/UK news,Police raid office in Unite union’s HQ in fraud investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/07/police-raid-office-in-unite-unions-hq-in-investigation
4/8/2022,"UK customs officials are battling to resolve an outage at a key post-Brexit IT system, with drivers complaining that the malfunction is adding to long delays for freight traffic trying to cross the Channel. A surge in Easter tourist traffic and reduced sailings from Dover, where several P&O ferries are still out of commission following the mass sacking of crew members, are combining with delays at customs to create havoc on the roads into the port, with parts of the coast-bound M20 motorway in Kent turned into a temporary lorry park as HGVs wait to reach France. Haulage industry insiders have put part of the blame for the gridlock on the week-long outage of one of the government’s new trade portals, the goods vehicle movement system (GVMS). It first experienced problems on 30 March, and has not been available for use by traders and hauliers since the following day. Drivers are being warned it may not be up and running until Monday. GVMS, which was developed by and is the responsibility of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), has been suffering a systems outage since it was temporarily taken offline during an update to another government customs system, handling import and export freight, known as Chief. Ciaran Donovan, a driver based in the UK who regularly moves goods back and forth between Britain and the continent, said he was unable to use the GVMS portal to get the goods movement reference (GMR) number – a barcode – required to leave the UK last Wednesday. “I had to cancel a job out to Paris on Thursday, which was annoying,” he said. GVMS users trying to access the service have been notified on at least two occasions over the past week that the system would soon be operational again. However, those dates have come and gone and the government has warned that GVMS will not be up and running again until midday on Monday 11 April. Traders trying to access GVMS are notified that HMRC is “still investigating ongoing issues” with the service. In the meantime, HMRC has implemented contingency measures, allowing hauliers to show “other evidence” that a customs declaration has been made to take goods out of or bring them into the UK, including a transit accompanying document or a movement reference number. Despite these interim measures, truckers say the requirement to provide different customs information is likely to add to processing time at the border. The GMR barcode is scannable and thought to save time. An HMRC spokesperson said: “Our IT systems are stable: we have put in place contingency processes to ensure businesses can keep goods and freight moving while we return to full service.” They apologised for any inconvenience and said they would work closely with customers to avoid disruption, adding that HMRC takes “system resilience very seriously”. Donovan said current disruption meant he was working out whether to accept future courier jobs: “I would rather not work than sit there for 20 hours trying to leave the country.” Duncan Buchanan, the policy director at the Road Haulage Association, described the week-long outage to GVMS as “really unhelpful”, at a time of an “accumulation” of other problems. The vessels usually operated by P&O Ferries are still out of action following the company’s mass sacking of 800 workers last month, representing a third of Dover’s usual ferry capacity. Bad weather has also delayed some sailings in recent days, just as tourist traffic booms before the Easter holidays, and the traffic backlog was further increased by the breakdown of a Eurotunnel train on Monday. Drivers faced another day of traffic chaos on Thursday, as lorries queued for hours to reach Dover port and the Eurotunnel terminal, and Kent residents faced disruption and diversions. A 23-mile stretch of the M20 from junction eight near Maidstone to junction 11 at Westenhanger was closed on Thursday to all non-freight traffic as part of the Operation Brock traffic management system. It was estimated that more than 2,000 lorries were stuck in the queue. “One member reported that they joined the queue at 8pm last night and this morning just before 9am they were still 30 miles from Dover,” said Buchanan, adding lorry drivers were being forced to wait in their cabs without access to toilets, or places to buy food and drink. “We are getting lots of feedback from drivers who are complaining about the absence of facilities. They are basically being advised to take their statutory rest before going to Kent.” Days of traffic chaos have also affected Kent residents and businesses, said Toby Howe, the tactical lead at the Kent Resilience Forum, a partnership of agencies and organisations. “We basically have more lorries coming into the county than can get out the other end,” Howe said. “This issue isn’t going to go away, and it is always Kent and its residents who have to pay the price if there are any problems on the Channel crossings.” Trevor Bartlett, the leader of Dover district council, warned in an open letter that the port would remain under severe pressure up to Easter, and would not hesitate to “declare a major incident” if Dover was again snarled up by port traffic, because of local fears that this could hamper the emergency services.",News/UK news,Customs IT meltdown adds to long delays at Port of Dover,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/07/customs-it-meltdown-adds-to-long-delays-at-port-of-dover
4/8/2022,"Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appear to shoot Russian prisoners of war outside a village west of Kyiv in a video posted online. The footage was originally shared on social media app Telegram. The New York Times said it had verified the video and the BBC said it had confirmed the location north of the town of Dmytrivka and found satellite images showing bodies on the ground. In the video, at least three men in camouflage, including one with a head wound and his hands tied behind his back, can be seen lying dead next to a fourth man, who is breathing heavily with a jacket covering his head. “He’s still alive. Film these marauders. Look, he’s still alive. He’s gasping,” a man in the video can be heard saying in Russian – a language widely spoken in Ukraine. A soldier then shoots him in the head twice. He continues to move, so the soldier shoots again, and he stops. A soldier can then be heard shouting “Glory to Ukraine”. A man responds with the phrase: “Glory to heroes.” The audio ends with a man saying: “Do not [expletive] come to our land.” The living soldiers in the video are wearing the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow on their arms, while the men on the floor wear white armbands, the colour of Russian troops. A few metres away from the bodies is a BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicle which is used by the Russian airborne unit. BBC investigators attempted to biometrically match the face of one of the men in the video, who can be seen facing the camera with a distinctive beard. They found a match to a Georgian man with close links to Ukraine, but are yet to confirm his identity. The broadcaster believes the word “Gruziny” – which means Georgians in Russian – can also be heard. Scenes in the video match the scenery on Google Street View of the main road outside Dmytrivka, which is about seven miles south-west of Bucha with roads to Irpin. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday he was aware of the video and it would “definitely be investigated”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he had not seen the video, but stated: “I will say that every report on potential violations of international law should be followed or looked into, and of course, any violation of international law and any war crime is always unacceptable.” A war crime is defined by the United Nations as a serious breach of international law committed against civilians or enemy forces during an armed conflict. The video emerges days after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Russian military of undertaking the worst war crimes since the second world war after the discovery of mass civilian graves in Bucha, a city 15 miles north of Kyiv.",News/World news,Video appears to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting Russian prisoners of war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/video-appears-to-show-ukrainian-soldiers-shooting-russian-prisoners-of-war
4/8/2022,"The two main criticisms of the government’s new energy security strategy are fair. The tiptoeing around onshore wind, which got gentle words of encouragement but no change to planning regulations, looks a case of political cowardice. It is perverse to apply a handbrake to “one of the cheapest forms of renewable power”, to use the government’s own description, when public opinion is broadly supportive of turbines on land. Objections from Tory backbenchers should have been ignored. Equally, the lack of new measures to tackle energy efficiency is bizarre since every serious body, from the International Energy Agency to our own National Infrastructure Commission, has been banging the drum for ages. “A gradual transition following the grain of behaviour,” translates as a win for the cold hand of the Treasury. There were two clear positives in the mix, it should be said. First, the target for more offshore wind is genuinely ambitious. A fivefold increase in capacity to 50 gigawatts by the end of the decade is a significant upgrade on the previous aim of 40GW. The target may even be achievable given the current rate of progress. And, from the perspective of energy security – the focus of this policy, don’t forget – offshore’s bigger turbines and higher load factors are always going to score well versus onshore. Second, solar was given a boost with the aim (though not a target, note) to increase capacity fivefold by 2035. It is illogical that the government seems more willing to flex planning rules for solar than for wind, but solar is the quiet success story of the renewables revolution. It has outpaced every cost projection over the past decade. Expansion looks the easiest to deliver. Then, though, one comes to the meat of the plan – the big bet on nuclear is, to put it mildly, hopeful. The government is trying to replace current capacity that will largely go offline by 2050 and also double nuclear’s share of electricity supply versus today’s position. The plan strains credibility. Up to eight new reactors – call it four new two-reactor plants the size of Hinkley Point C – is an enormous undertaking. The best that can be said is that it is possible to imagine how events could, possibly, run favourably. Hinkley could arrive within its revised timetable without further cost hiccups. Sizewell C in Suffolk, the next plant on the block, could attract the desired rush of private-sector investors under a new financing model that would allow the juice to be priced within the £60-£70 a megawatt hour range of political acceptability. And success in financing Sizewell could breed confidence and get the show rolling. There are, though, a lot of assumptions in that list. The biggest unknown is whether the government is prepared to back the EPR design – the one used at Hinkley and set for Sizewell – for all the new plants. Logic says it should because mixing and matching designs is a recipe for higher costs and surprises, a point stressed by energy analyst Peter Atherton. The productivity gain in constructing Hinkley’s second reactor, for example, is said to be 15%. In a complex process, replicating one design has demonstrable value. The government is not, though, at the stage where it can have sufficient confidence to back EPRs whole-heartedly and mean it. Talk of “leading the world” in nuclear construction should therefore be filed under “believe it when you see it”. You have to know what you plan to build to make such boasts. There is an alarming nuclear-sized question mark at the heart of this strategy. See, resolutions from agitating shareholders can make a difference. Well, the tale of two pay rises for frontline staff in the supermarket sector cannot be attributed directly to the resolution filed at Sainsbury’s by campaign group Share Action with backing from Legal & General among others. But it probably helped to concentrate minds in the boardroom. Tesco is raising its minimum hourly rate of pay by 5.8% to £10.10 from late-July. Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s is expected to lift the rate for staff in outer London from £10.50 per hour to £11.05, meaning those workers will join colleagues in the rest of the country in getting the real living wage at a minimum. The shareholder resolution called on Sainsbury’s (and, by extension, its main competitors) to get itself accredited as a real living wage employer, which would require it go further. The commitment has to be permanent and third-party contractors, such as cleaners and security guards, have to be included. But perhaps the pace is quickening. It should: large supermarket chains should be able to meet accepted definitions of living wages.",News/Business,Johnson’s political cowardice applies the brake to cheap energy as he bets nuclear | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/07/johnsons-political-cowardice-applies-the-brake-to-cheap-energy-as-he-bets-nuclear
4/8/2022,"Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the US supreme court has passed the Senate and she will now become the first Black female justice on America’s highest legal body after being nominated by president Joe Biden earlier this year. Jackson’s nomination has been widely praised by women of color, especially after she sustained grueling confirmation hearings at the hands of some top Republicans who seemed dedicated to political points-scoring and whose criticisms often seemed like racist dog-whistling. Here are four women of color talking about Jackson and the significance of her nomination: Kamala Harris, US vice-president: “I’ll tell you what I think you know. Judge Jackson is a phenomenal jurist,” Harris said last month in Selma, Alabama, during the 57th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday”. Jackson “proves her commitment not only to public service but to equal justice and equal rights”, Harris added. “As she makes history, Judge Jackson, like us all, stands on the shoulders of giants. She and we are their legacy.” Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center: “The world demands untold levels of strength from Black women on a daily basis. The perseverance Jackson held close is all too familiar to Black women across this country,” Graves wrote in a CNN op-ed last month during Jackson’s confirmation hearings. “​​We hailed her career and celebrated not only her, but also the work of countless Black women silenced, erased and excluded from the top echelon of the legal profession,” she said, adding: “This will be the legacy of her rise to the supreme court: a young Black girl, one of a generation of Black girls, joyful at the sight of new possibilities for her own life.” Ann Claire Williams, retired US circuit judge of the US court of appeals for the 7th circuit: In a statement on behalf of the American Bar Association’s standing committee on the federal judiciary, Williams wrote: “Judge Jackson has a sterling reputation for integrity. Judges and lawyers who have known her in every capacity uniformly praised her character, calling her integrity ‘beyond reproach,’ ‘first rate,’ and ‘impeccable.’” “Our extensive review leads us to conclude that Judge Jackson meets the highest standards of integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament,” Williams continued, granting Jackson the ABA’s highest rating. Angela Onwuachi-Willig, dean of Boston University School of Law: “We don’t only get judged by our actions as individuals, all Black people get judged by our actions,” Onwuachi-Willig said in reference to Jackson’s confirmation hearings. “That’s an enormous weight. Judge Jackson was carrying that weight for hours and hours and hours, and I felt that was a human moment.” “With nearly 10 years of service as a federal judge, experience clerking for Supreme court justice Stephen Breyer and two lower-court judges, and a record of leadership on the United States Sentencing Commission, she will make an incredible supreme court justice,” Onwuachi-Willig also said in a letter, along with more than 200 other Black women law deans and professors, that urged the Senate’s confirmation of Jackson.",News/US news,‘All too familiar perseverance’: women of color on Ketanji Brown Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmation-women-of-color-praise
4/8/2022,"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson reached a historic milestone on Thursday, becoming the first Black woman ever appointed to the US supreme court. But before Jackson could be confirmed, she first had to navigate a brutal opposition campaign from far-right critics who challenged her credentials and outlandishly accused her of supporting child abuse. The bareknuckle tactics used by some Republicans to discredit Jackson underscored just how far to the right the party has drifted and may foreshadow a new, disturbing “normal” for American politics. The Republican senator Roger Wicker offered a preview of the ugly attacks to come when he said in late January, before Jackson was even nominated, that Joe Biden’s appointee would be the beneficiary of affirmative action because the president had already promised to select a Black woman for the post. That comment sparked outrage among Democrats, who noted Biden would have a wealth of qualified candidates to choose from to fill Stephen Breyer’s seat. After Jackson’s nomination was announced in February, Tucker Carlson, the far-right Fox News host, took it a step farther by demanding that the White House release her score on the LSAT, a standardized test for law school applicants. “So is Ketanji Brown Jackson – a name that even Joe Biden has trouble pronouncing – one of the top legal minds in the entire country?” Carlson asked. “[I]t might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Ketanji Brown Jackson’s LSAT score was … It would seem like Americans in a democracy have a right to know.” Carlson’s complaint seemed to ignore that Jackson is considered one of the most qualified supreme court nominees in recent history. She has served as a supreme court clerk, a public defender, a district court judge, a member of the US Sentencing Commission and a federal appeals judge. Carlson’s mockery of Jackson’s first name, which is pronounced “kee-TON-jee,” also struck critics as a racist dog-whistle. But worse was to come. The beginning of Jackson’s confirmation hearings last month spurred a new, alarming line of attack from certain Republicans. In a Twitter thread shared days before the start of the hearings, Josh Hawley, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, claimed Jackson had a “pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes”. Hawley’s claims were quickly debunked by factcheckers and even conservative legal experts, who showed that Jackson’s sentencing practices for child abuse image offenders were in the mainstream for federal judges. One White House official dismissed Hawley’s claims as an “embarrassing, QAnon-signaling smear”, referring to the baseless conspiracy theory that Democratic leaders are members of an evil cabal involved in child sex trafficking. The left-leaning organization Media Matters reported that Hawley’s comments quickly spread on internet forums linked to QAnon. But instead of abandoning the accusation when it was proved to be demonstrably false and potentially dangerous, more Republican senators joined Hawley in grilling Jackson about her handling of child abuse cases. Lindsey Graham, who voted to confirm Jackson to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit last year, told her during the hearings, “Every judge who does what you are doing is making it easier for the children to be exploited.” Graham, who previously voted for both of Barack Obama’s supreme court nominees and has now become a close ally of Donald Trump, serves as a case study in the Republican party’s move toward the far right. “Lindsey Graham is the epitome of a political parasite. He needs to have a host in order to thrive,” said Tara Setmayer, a former House Republican communications adviser who left the party in 2020. “He did it with John McCain. He did it again with Donald Trump. And now he’s doing it with the Maga/QAnon base in order to maintain relevancy.” Jim Manley, a former senior adviser to the late Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid, said it was “shocking yet not surprising” to see Senate Republicans resorting to such tactics. “It was one thing to work in the Senate and to watch traditionally conservative senators like Chuck Grassley start spouting Tea Party lines in 2009, 2010,” Manley said. “But to see more and more House and Senate Republicans spout QAnon-friendly talking points is a whole nother ballgame and shows to me that there’s a real poison moving through the Republican party.” It should be noted that three Senate Republicans – Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney – supported Jackson’s nomination. When Murkowski and Romney announced their support earlier this week, the extremist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene responded by explicitly accusing Jackson and her supporters of endorsing child sexual abuse. “Any Senator voting to confirm #KJB is pro-pedophile just like she is,” Greene said on Twitter. “You are either a Senator that supports child rapists, child pornography, and the most vile child predators. Or you are a Senator who protects children and votes NO to KJB!” Setmayer warned that Republican leaders’ refusal to condemn the rhetoric of Greene and her ilk will only encourage lawmakers to offer more appeals to QAnon supporters. “They are in the driver’s seat of today’s Republican party, as much as the establishment wants to deny that,” Setmayer said. “And not only is it dangerous, but it undermines our democracy, when people like this are given a platform and are given power.” Manley echoed that point, warning that some Republicans’ embrace of conspiracy theories will make it all the more difficult for Congress to pass even the most basic legislation, such as government funding bills. “I’ve been saying for years the Senate is broken. But what I saw during these confirmation hearings has got me really concerned about our fundamental ability to legislate,” Manley said. “This is far beyond anything that I’ve ever seen before in my time on Capitol Hill.” And there are no signs of this increased extremism among Republican members of Congress diminishing anytime soon. According to Media Matters, at least 59 congressional candidates in the 2022 election cycle have expressed some level of support for QAnon. The success of those candidates would allow the QAnon-supporting faction in Congress to grow its ranks after the midterm elections in November. If that happens, the vicious attacks seen during Jackson’s confirmation hearings may become all too common.",News/US news,Republicans’ ugly attacks on Ketanji Brown Jackson show lurch to far right,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/republicans-ketanji-brown-jackson-qanon-far-right
4/8/2022,"Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the US supreme court shatters several glass ceilings in America’s long struggle to form a more perfect union. Not only will she be the first Black woman to sit on the court since it assembled in 1790. She will also be the first justice with experience as a public defender to join a bench that has hosted many former prosecutors. When Jackson takes her seat on the nine-justice panel, following Stephen Breyer’s retirement probably in June, she will also raise its female contingent to four – a historic number that brings a majority of female justices within reach. On a more personal level, her promotion to the supreme court is the fulfillment of her ambition to excel at the law which she has nurtured from a young age. It is the realization of the promise given to her by her parents, who were themselves brought up under the ignominies of racial segregation in the US south. As Jackson said in her opening remarks to the confirmation process: “My parents taught me that, unlike the many barriers that they had had to face growing up, my path was clearer, such that if I worked hard and believed in myself, in America I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be.” Jackson, 51, was born in Washington DC where her parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, relocated to escape Jim Crow in the great migration. The family moved back to Miami, Florida, where she spent most of her childhood. She caught the legal bug from her father who trained to be a lawyer as a mature student when she was at preschool. “He had his stack of law books on the kitchen table while I sat across from him with my stack of coloring books,” she told the Senate judiciary committee. Jackson imbibed from her parents a pride in her roots. They gave her an African name: “Ketanji Onyika”, meaning “lovely one”. Born in 1970, Jackson describes herself as a child of the 70s. She was aware that the educational and other opportunities she enjoyed as a member of a burgeoning Black professional class were a product of the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 60s. After Miami Palmetto senior high school she studied as an undergraduate at Harvard, followed by Harvard law school. It was at college that she met her husband, a surgeon, Patrick Jackson; they have two daughters, Talia, 21, and Leila, 17. At her confirmation hearings, Republican senators attempted to depict Jackson as a rabid leftist in hock to socialist groups. The truth is much less dramatic: as an individual and a jurist, she has preferred compromise over conflict, evidential fact over ideology. “She was always the person trying to find the middle ground,” one of her Harvard roommates, Nina Coleman Simmons, told the Washington Post. Pressed by Republicans at the confirmation hearings to divulge her “judicial philosophy”, she insisted she had none. Rather, she relied on what she called a “methodology” based on neutrality, the facts in the case and a faithful reading of the law. Jackson emphasized at the confirmation hearings that her outlook was influenced by her wider family. She has two uncles who were police officers in Miami while her brother, Ketajh, worked for the Baltimore police department before joining the Maryland army national guard. Jackson did not mention that she had another uncle, Thomas Brown, who was sentenced to life in prison for minor non-violent drug offenses under a brutal three-strikes law. He was released in 2017 after Obama commuted his sentence, but died soon after. We do not know, given her near silence on the issue, whether Thomas’s plight influenced her decision to work as a federal public defender in Washington. It is notable that during the two years she spent in that role she successfully challenged several cases involving excessively long sentences. Republicans sought to cast doubt on her sentencing of sex offenders, implying she was sympathetically lenient towards them, but factcheckers have found her approach to have been entirely unremarkable for such cases. In probably her most famous district court ruling, in 2019 she ordered the former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify before Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference. Rejecting Donald Trump’s claim of executive privilege, she stated: “The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings.” Trump was also the subject of one of the few cases she has adjudicated on the federal appellate court in Washington since Joe Biden nominated her last year. In December she ruled for a second time against Trump, finding that the congressional committee investigating the Capitol insurrection on January 6 had a right to see White House records. Jackson’s arrival on the highest court will not change its six conservative to three liberal-leaning power balance. But given that supreme court justices are appointed for life, she could serve for three decades or more and in so doing help to shape the country’s judicial landscape for at least a generation. There will be no honeymoon period: she will be flung immediately into some extremely thorny cases in her debut October 2022 term. She has said that she will recuse herself from one of the most politically charged cases on the docket – challenges to affirmative action at Harvard and the University of North Carolina – given her current role with Harvard’s board of overseers. But there are many more highly contentious cases already piling up, including a dispute over the Clean Water Act relating to wetlands, a look at welfare laws for Native American children, and the question of whether artists, in this case a website designer, can be obliged to do work celebrating gay marriage when it goes against their religious beliefs. Her initiation to the nation’s highest court is already shaping up to be a blockbuster.",News/Law,Ketanji Brown Jackson’s blazing trail to become the first Black female justice,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/07/ketanji-brown-jackson-us-supreme-court-profile
4/8/2022,"Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal appeals court judge, won enough support to secure her confirmation to the supreme court on Thursday, overcoming a rancorous Senate approval process to become the first Black woman to serve as a justice on the high court in its more than 200-year history. After weeks of private meetings and days of public testimony, marked by intense sparring over judicial philosophy and personal reflections on race in America, Jackson’s nomination crossed the 50-vote threshold in the Senate on Thursday afternoon, virtually guaranteeing her confirmation. Jackson, who currently serves on the US court of appeals for the DC Circuit, will replace Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, the most senior member of the court’s liberal bloc. Breyer, for whom Jackson clerked early in her legal career, said he intends to retire from the court this summer. At 51, Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades. Her ascension, however, will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court, dominated by a 6-3 conservative majority. Shortly before the final vote, Kyrsten Sinema announced she would vote yes on Jackson’s nomination, ensuring that all 50 Democratic senators would support confirmation. “Judge Jackson brings to the bench a wealth of knowledge, more trial court experience than all other current supreme court justices combined, a commitment to respect precedent, and a proven independent, pragmatic approach to judicial decisions,” Sinema said. “Judge Jackson has exceptional qualifications and will serve our country well in the years to come.” Ahead of the vote, three Senate Republicans – Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine – indicated they would back Jackson’s nomination. Their support was a welcome result for the White House, which had been intent on securing a bipartisan confirmation. Assailing Jackson’s record, but acknowledging Republicans did not have the votes to stop her confirmation, minority leader Mitch McConnell implored the judge to embrace the textualist approach of conservative justices. “The soon-to-be justice can either satisfy her radical fan club or help preserve the judiciary that Americans need, but not both,” McConnell said ahead of the vote on Thursday. “I’m afraid the nominee’s record tells us which is likely, but I hope judge Jackson proves me wrong.” Her confirmation to the lifetime post represents the fulfillment of a promise Biden made to his supporters at the nadir of his 2020 campaign for president, when he vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the supreme court, if elected president and a vacancy arose. The opportunity presented itself earlier this year, at another low point for Biden, with momentous domestic and foreign challenges weighing on his presidency. During the public hearings, Jackson vowed to be an independent justice who would seek to ensure that the words inscribed on the marbled supreme court building – Equal Justice Under the Law – were a “reality and not just an ideal”. With her parents and daughters present, Jackson recounted for the Senate judiciary committee her family’s generational journey, as the daughter of public school teachers raised in the segregated south who would rise to become a justice on a court that once denied Black Americans citizenship. Yet any hope by the White House that Jackson’s historic nomination might defuse some of the bitter partisanship that senators lament has turned the process into a “circus” quickly evaporated. With an eye to the November midterm elections, Republicans led an aggressive campaign against the judge during her confirmation hearings and in conservative media, raising questions about her record in an effort to paint her as an “activist judge” who is soft on crime. They used the confirmation proceedings to air conservative grievances about past supreme court nominations and to wage culture war battles over critical race theory, crime and transgender women in sports. Couched in thinly coded appeals to racism and the far-right fringes with nods to the QAnon conspiracy theory, some Republicans accused Jackson of being too lenient on child sexual abuse offenders, claims she forcefully rebutted “as a mother and a judge”. Legal experts have said her decisions in such criminal cases were within the mainstream while independent factcheckers concluded that the attacks were misleading and a distortion of her record. Democrats, and the handful of Republicans who supported her, praised her qualifications and demeanor, and in particular the restraint she showed during some stinging exchanges with conservative senators. They sought to defend her record, noting that her sentencing record was within the mainstream of the federal judiciary, while emphasizing the support she had earned from within the legal community, including among conservative justices, and her endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, which cited her family’s law enforcement background. In a mark of just how polarizing the process of confirming a supreme court nominee has become, the Senate judiciary committee deadlocked along party lines over her nomination. The resulting tie prompted Democrats to execute a rare procedural maneuver to “discharge” her nomination from the committee to the floor, with a vote by the full Senate. The NAACP said the vote by 11 Republicans against Jackson’s nomination was a “stain” on the committee. A graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School, Jackson served on the independent US sentencing commission, an agency that develops sentencing guidelines, before becoming a federal judge. While she shares an elite background with the other justices, her work as a public defender sets her apart. The last justice with experience representing criminal defendants was Thurgood Marshall, the towering civil rights lawyer who became the first Black member of the supreme court.",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed as first Black woman on US supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmation-us-supreme-court
4/8/2022,"It is not the legality of what the chancellor of the exchequer and his wife do with their money that matters; it’s the message that their choice sends about inequality and unfairness in Britain today. Rishi Sunak lives in Downing Street with his wife and their two children. As chancellor of the exchequer, he is in charge of the UK’s tax system and the country’s finances at a time when everybody’s living costs are soaring and public money is extremely tight. Mr Sunak naturally pays UK taxes on his earnings and assets. His wife, Akshata Murty, does not. Although she has lived here for much of the past decade, Ms Murty holds non-domiciled tax status in the UK. This means that she pays no UK tax on her overseas earnings, on the basis that her permanent home is not here. Ms Murty is very, very rich indeed. Her stake in her Indian father’s technology business alone is worth an estimated £690m. She would have received around £11.5m in dividends from these shares in the last tax year. If she was a UK taxpayer, the Treasury would have taxed that at a rate of 38.1%, bringing in well over £4m a year to the public finances. Ms Murty has broken no law by shielding that money from the Treasury. Her office stresses that she has also paid overseas taxes on the earnings. The UK’s independent adviser on ministerial interests has approved the arrangements. Non-dom tax status, after all, has existed since the colonial era. Regrettably, it remains legal. It is based on the idea that while a person may live here all year round, as Ms Murty does, they regard a foreign country, in this case India, as their true home. At the last count, some 75,700 individuals claimed non-dom status, thus depriving the Treasury of nearly £8bn in taxes and national insurance. But the overwhelming majority of taxpayers who live in this country do not have this option. That is why the Sunak-Murty finances matter. At a time when personal taxes have just gone up, when the cost of living is rising steeply, when inflation is increasing, and when benefits are falling in value in real terms – and when Mr Sunak is the all-powerful minister responsible for every single one of these issues – the revelation of his rich wife’s choice of non-dom status sends a message that there is one law for the rich and another law for the rest of us. This may be legal, but it is, quite simply, unfair. For the Conservative government, and for Mr Sunak in particular, this is a serious moment. The partygate revelations, whose repercussions are far from over, caused Tory fortunes to plunge precisely because they showed that the sacrifices ordinary people were making for the common good were not being taken seriously by their rulers. This new disclosure says something similar. A less complacent government than this one has now become would surely have seen this embarrassment coming. It is another big blow to Mr Sunak’s reputation and ambitions, after a shabbily constructed spring financial statement and a steep downturn in the chancellor’s popularity ratings with the public and the party. His position as the heir apparent now looks fragile, and Boris Johnson may even decide to look for a more biddable chancellor in the summer reshuffle, assuming he survives that far. Just when the Conservatives may have hoped that the Ukraine war might conveniently push domestic concerns aside during the local election campaign, here is another reminder that this government’s loss of moral authority may in fact now be terminal.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on non-dom tax status: them not us | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-non-dom-tax-status-them-not-us
4/8/2022,"Afew weeks after the November Cop26 summit concluded in Glasgow, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy published a striking snapshot of public attitudes towards the climate emergency. It showed that popular support for renewable energy, including onshore wind farms, had reached record levels. Given a cost-of-living crunch caused by the rocketing price of fossil fuels, and the new priority of energy independence following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an imaginative and proactive government would move to harness this enthusiasm and seize the moment. Sadly, Britain is not blessed with such a government. The future energy strategy unveiled by Boris Johnson on Thursday instead carries some of the hallmarks of his flawed government: a prime ministerial penchant for grands projets that may or may not be deliverable; a tendency to be unduly influenced by vocal lobby groups on the right of the Conservative party; and a propensity to set targets without doing the necessary work to enable them to be met. The aspiration that 95% of the UK’s electricity should come from renewable sources by 2030 is admirable, and the commitment to hugely increase offshore wind and solar capacity is significant. But inexplicable lacunae and wrong priorities make this a tale of missed opportunities. The government has placed nuclear power at the heart of its approach, promising that as many as eight new reactors will be built. The realpolitik of meeting net zero targets means that nuclear, as a least worst option, should be part of the future energy mix. But the scale of Mr Johnson’s ambition represents a hugely expensive long-term gamble, the funding of which is conveniently buried somewhere in the long grass. According to the government’s own calculations, the journey from initial investment in a plant to the generation of electricity takes up to 17 years. Meanwhile, far faster routes to fulfilling net zero obligations and driving down spiralling fuel bills have been rejected or ignored. Four out of five members of the public support the use of onshore wind farms, which could be built quickly and cheaply if planning rules were eased. This was rumoured to be on the cards. But Mr Johnson has instead bowed to the nimby instincts of Tory MPs and ministers, whose views are at odds with the mood of the country, but who have the power to make life difficult in parliament. Limited consultations with some “supportive” communities will have next to no impact and a game-changing possibility has been lost. A golden chance to fund greater energy efficiency and better insulation in Britain’s leaky housing stock has also been missed, despite the relief this would afford the less well-off in particular. The Treasury’s apparent refusal to fund the expansion of an existing scheme to help poorer households is particularly callous, given the eye-watering bills that will drop on doormats next winter. But it is also emblematic of an administration that consistently fails to grasp the bigger picture. Promoting demand-side energy efficiency is fundamental in the drive to net zero, but the government must make the transition to green energy attractive, feasible and affordable if people are to take the plunge in their own homes. The public knows that radical action is needed to cope with long-term and short-term energy crises. This flawed strategy for the future demonstrates that the government has yet to find the courage to rise to the challenge.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s energy strategy: missed opportunities | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-energy-strategy-missed-opportunities
4/8/2022,"The Spanish tourist board in London has performed a U-turn on its announcement that the country will open its borders to unvaccinated British holidaymakers. The tourist office first told travellers that Spain would open up to all Britons, regardless of vaccine status, as long as they could provide a negative pre-departure test. But, in the latest disruption to the Easter holidays, the decision was reversed within hours. The rapid about-turn was due to what the tourist board called a “miscommunication” due to a “misinterpretation” of entry requirements published by the Spanish health department. “We apologise unreservedly,” Pedro Medina, the deputy director of the Spanish Tourist Office in the UK, said in a statement. British travellers aged 12 and above are still required to show proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to arrival in Spain, or to show a recovery certificate from coronavirus within a 180-day period of testing positive. The tourist office added: “If more than 270 days have passed since the final dose, certification of a booster vaccination is also required, except for teenagers aged 12 to 17 inclusive.” On Twitter, Julia Lo Bue-Said, the chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership group, the UK’s largest independent consortium of travel agents and travel management companies, called the reversal a “spectacular blunder” and “just madness”. However, children aged 12-17 are able to get into the country provided they show a negative PCR test within 72 hours of arrival in Spain. The announcement was first made in February when the Spanish government said children aged 12-17 from non-EU countries no longer needing to be fully vaccinated. Spain, one of the UK’s most popular overseas holiday destinations, is among several EU destinations requiring anyone who was vaccinated more than 270 days ago to have a booster to enter the country.",News/World news,Spain reverses plan to open borders to Britons without Covid vaccine ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/spain-reverses-plan-to-open-up-to-britons-without-covid-vaccine
4/8/2022,"Sir Alex Ferguson was celebrating on Merseyside for the second year running on Thursday as Clan Des Obeaux, the best horse he has owned in nearly 25 years in racing, took the Betway Bowl on the opening day of the Grand National meeting at Aintree. The former Manchester United manager had an interest in two runners in the race, and the money beforehand suggested that Protektorat, from the Dan Skelton yard, was fancied to land the first Grade One win of his career. Clan Des Obeaux was always travelling sweetly for Harry Cobden, however, at a track that plays to his strengths, and despite idling on the run-in he got home by a length from the Irish Gold Cup winner, Conflated. “We couldn’t believe the price he went out to,” Ferguson said. “Protektorat was a worthy favourite but maybe the Gold Cup [in which he finished third] had just taken a bit out of him. “Racing is part of my life more than football now. I’ve a few with [co-owner] Ged [Mason] and John Hales and we got great enjoyment last year winning three Grade Ones here. I never won three in a row at Anfield, that’s for sure. I need to speak to Paul [Nicholls] about the Grand National [next year]. He will be 11 and it is probably the one thing to try at his age.” There was a dramatic conclusion and aftermath to the Anniversary 4YO Hurdle earlier on the card as Knight Salute and Pied Piper initially dead-heated for first in the Grade One event, before Knight Salute was awarded the spoils in the stewards’ room. The stewards decided that Pied Piper had impeded Knight Salute by jumping left at the final flight, despite being told by Paddy Brennan, his rider, that he had not lost any momentum and that he felt a dead heat was “a very fair result”. Davy Russell, meanwhile, told the officials that he had gone too soon on the 10-11 favourite. “I knew riding the race it was completely wrong,” Russell said, “but he travelled so well and my hands were tied.” Milton Harris, whose colourful life and career has included drinking sessions with Cary Grant, dating Belinda Carlisle and seven years without a licence after being declared bankrupt, was celebrating his first Grade One success. “It doesn’t sit easy with me as they’ve had a good battle,” Harris said. “I was happy with the original result but the stewards have a job to do. “When he [Pied Piper] has given him a bump, that has probably helped him.

4/8/2022,"Rescuers are searching for a British father and son off the coast of Malaysia after the pair disappeared on Wednesday during a group training dive. Adrian Chesters, 46, and his 14-year-old son, Nathen, were diving off the coast of Mersing, in the southern state of Johor. Alexia Alexandra Molina, 18, from France, also remains unaccounted for. Police said on Thursday that they still believed the divers would be found. The district chief, Cyril Edward Nuing, said: “With their equipment, their full gear and their experience, we believe there is a strong chance of finding them alive.” Diving has since been suspended off Mersing, with the boat’s skipper detained by police amid the investigation. Diving instructor Kristine Grodem, 35, who was training the group for their advanced licences, has been found safe after becoming separated from the group. An hour into the dive, alarms were raised after the group did not surface. According to maritime officials, Grodem was rescued by a tug boat before being airlifted from the scene. Grodem told police that the three others had managed to surface. The search resumed on Thursday morning after being called off late on Wednesday due to poor visibility. The rescue effort included two planes, 18 boats and nearly 90 personnel including rescue divers. “We cannot allow diving to continue if safety measures are compromised,” said Johor’s sultan, Ibrahim Iskandar.

4/8/2022,"The trial of a Greek helicopter pilot accused of strangling his British wife as she slept next to their baby daughter is due to begin on Friday in Athens. Nearly a year after Caroline Crouch was found dead in the couple’s maisonette, her husband, who had originally attempted to pin the murder on ruthless “foreign thieves”, will appear before a mixed jury court in the Greek capital. It will be the first time that Babis Anagnostopoulos, 33, has been seen in public since his alleged confession to a crime that has gripped the nation. “We have been waiting for this moment,” the Crouch family’s lawyer Thanassis Haramanis told the Guardian. “We are confident that justice will prevail.” In a trial that is likely to be as dramatic as it is long, the UK-trained aviator could take the stand within hours of the hearing getting under way. Before proceedings officially begin precedents have been set: for the first time in Greek legal history the defendant, who stands accused of premeditated murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying to police, also faces the charge of killing an animal under groundbreaking legislation passed last year. The pilot allegedly admitted using a leash to hang Crouch’s seven-month-old puppy, Roxy, from the banister of the couple’s home in suburban Athens to make the break-in seem more realistic. Investigators encountered the choked pet before finding Caroline’s body next to Lydia, her daughter, on the upper level of the maisonette. “He will do everything to reduce his sentence and convince the court that Caroline’s death wasn’t pre-meditated,” Haramanis said. “But he also faces the prospect of 10 years or more in prison for killing Caroline’s puppy.” A stray adopted only months before the 11 May murder, Roxy has been assigned its own legal representation paid for by an animal welfare group that has urged members to protest outside the court alongside women’s organisations enraged at the killing – one of 17 femicides in Greece last year. For 37 days Anagnostopoulos claimed his wife’s death was the result of a botched burglary, during which time he gave a heart-rending eulogy at her funeral on the island of Alonissos where 20-year-old Crouch was raised. It was only after eight hours of police questioning – following his arrest at her memorial – that investigators allege he confessed to the crime. Police who had encouraged the government to take the rare step of announcing a €300,000 (£250,000) bounty for information that might lead to the assailants, said they had been fooled by a man they described as a “top-class actor”. Anagnostopoulos, who is detained in Athens’ high-security Koyrdallos prison, has claimed, through his lawyers, that his wife’s “narcissistic and aggressive behaviour” were to blame for the fit of rage that prompted him to commit the crime. But in a 24-page report, Giorgos Noulis, the public prosecutor assigned to the case, contended otherwise, saying the pilot was in a “calm state of mind” when he chose to kill the student. “He had no inhibition to go through with the act despite the fact that she was the mother of his child,” the magistrate was quoted as saying in the report excerpts of which appeared in the Greek press. “The victim was just 20 years old while he was 13 years older and should have been her protector.” The daughter of a retired oil executive who settled on Alonissos, Crouch had been asleep for more than two hours prior to her murder. Investigators, piecing together the sequence of events based on a handwritten diary that spoke of an increasingly abusive relationship, believe she threatened the pilot with divorce during a heated altercation earlier that night. Her death was depicted as “agonising” by a coroner who estimated after examination of her body that asphyxiation “took five to six minutes”. Greek media reports describe Anagnostopoulos as having spent months poring over legal textbooks in a bid to finesse his defence. At least four witnesses from the couple’s “broader social circle” will testify in his defence, his lawyer Alexandros Papaioannidis said ahead of the trial. Haramanis, the Crouch family lawyer, said it was unclear if Caroline Crouch’s parents, who now have custody of Lydia, would attend proceedings. “Her mother can still not believe that she was consoled by the man who took her beloved daughter away,” he said. “I don’t know if they could bear to be in the same room with him.”",News/World news,Trial of Greek pilot accused of murdering British wife Caroline Crouch to begin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/caroline-crouch-murder-babis-anagnostopoulos-trial-athens
4/8/2022,"Just before the opening of Anna Karenina, one of the most famous Russian stories of all time, a message is projected on to the stage: “The Australian Ballet opens our heart to the victims of the war in Ukraine.” It makes for a sobering prologue to this much-anticipated production, which was twice postponed by the pandemic, and now opens in Sydney on a day when the world is learning of Russian atrocities in the city of Bucha. It is a dark time to be watching this story. The ballet’s choreographer, Yuri Possokhov, was born in Lugansk, Ukraine, and trained in Moscow before joining the Bolshoi Ballet. His distilled and beautifully spare version of Leo Tolstoy’s epic tale of love, adultery, morality and duty, is a jointly commissioned production by Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet and the Australian Ballet. It is a ballet for adults rather than children: no lavish “chocolate-box” elements, no snow on stage, no one arrives in a troika, there are no ballrooms. Instead, we witness a complex psychological drama full of yearning and restraint, desire and madness, on a bare stage with little more than a bed, an easel or a hay bale to provide physical context. Robyn Hendricks, as Anna, is already a superstar of the Australian Ballet and here she is mesmerising as the young married woman expressing her full seductive power with liquid movements of her arms, draped in black velvet and lace, or a simple stretch of her neck. Later, she lets rip with partner, Callum Linnane (Anna’s lover, Count Vronksy), in one of the steamiest sex scenes in ballet. Linnane is a rising star who brings palpable heat to the role. His Vronsky is a young soldier with plenty of snap in his legs and a towering, luminous beauty. His acting isn’t as strong as Hendricks’, who is magnificent in her mad scene, but their dancing together looks effortless. Hendricks makes it clear that Anna knows their love story can never work out. One dance, in which a feverish Anna dreams of having a husband (Adam Bull as Alexei Karenin) and a lover simultaneously, is a highlight of the production. In the smaller featured roles, Benedicte Beme is bright, sharp and bouncy as the teenage debutante Kitty Shcherbatskaya, and her soon-to-be husband, Konstantin Levin, is performed beautifully by Brett Chynoweth, whose final solo is a knockout. For those in the audience who don’t already know Tolstoy’s story, it might be hard to follow. The plot isn’t spelled out but the striking and sophisticated visual images help the viewer. The train station, the racecourse and a field in the countryside are supported by projected film and glorious lighting (by David Finn) that washes over the stage. The dancers are dressed in the colours of a Rothko painting, burnt orange and red or dark shades of blue, with designer Tom Pye drawing on 19th-century underwear designs for Anna’s “undressed” looks. The music composed by Ilya Demutsky, one of the most sought-after composers in the world, is a real star of the production. The piano is often front and centre, with wind instruments rather than strings driving the emotion. At times, it sounds like a sweeping film score. Occasionally, the musicians are so quiet and still that we lean in to hear them. This production is a modern masterpiece to be savoured, a gift for those who love ballet, students of the artform and anyone who appreciates literature, design and music.

4/8/2022,"We all love a kitchen comeback. Think the return of meatloaf, or when, inexplicably, prawn cocktail got its groove back. Chefs are skilled at trawling the depths of nostalgia, from the trope of “I learned to cook this dish at my nana’s knee”, to mining collective food memories. “I’ve always gone back and done a lot of reading of old cookbooks,” says chef Blaze Young, who heads up the kitchen at Fremantle wine bar Nieuw Ruin. “I kind of love old-school, 1950s grandma food, and old Australiana.” Young isn’t wed to her own grandmother’s style of cooking; she also enjoys interpreting the food memories of others. One such effort, a confit fish “under a fur coat”, has become her signature dish. The childhood memories of Nieuw Ruin’s owner Dimitri Rtshiladze were the inspiration for this spin on “herring under a fur coat”. Rtshiladze, who is of Georgian descent, told Young about the eastern European classic. “Traditionally it’s made with tinned, preserved herring, and then it’s layered with cold vegetables,” she says. “I guess to make the herring a little bit more appetising.” Young uses monkfish from Scott Reef off the north-west coast of Western Australia. It is a by-catch, which she says has a “beautiful vegetal flavour” reminiscent of leeks when slowly confited. A bottom layer of blanched potatoes is dressed sparingly with pickled shallot, followed by the confit monkfish, fresh dill, then blanched carrot, roast beetroot spiked with a little bit of horseradish, with a final layer of egg salad made with a quality olive oil mayonnaise. The six layers are prepared “incredibly simply”, says Young, making them “really clean examples of that ingredient” when eaten individually but “really complex and interesting” when eaten together. The final touch is salty, smoked Yarra Valley caviar – an element of decadence for a traditionally humble dish. In Sydney, food writer Jill Dupleix’s dreams of comeback dishes were brought to life at relative newcomer, Ursula’s in Paddington. “My gran used to do the best flummery ever,” she says. “It would float off the table, and there it is at Ursula’s.” Phil Wood, chef-owner at Ursula’s, says “It used to be well known, featured in those guides to home cooking for the Australian housewife, like the CWA books, The Golden Wattle Cookery Book. [But] a lot of it has just kind of fallen by the wayside a little bit … It’s remarkable how quickly things can disappear within a generation.” While flummery’s English cousin is centuries old, the Australian version of flummery was born out of post-war necessity, says Wood. The original recipe combines packet fruit jelly and evaporated milk. The evaporated milk must be “made really cold, and when you whip, it whips up like fake cream”. The fruit jelly is left in the fridge until almost set. Then you “fold those two things together, ending up with this flavoured mousse”. While Wood is known for flawless technique, his iteration of the dish is easy to make. He uses juiced strawberries for a more natural flavouring, but it still contains the all-important evaporated milk. His is a little lighter than traditional flummery, which can be “a bit on the spongy side rather than aerated”. The dish is currently off the menu, but is due another comeback when light spring fruit is back in season. Melbourne-based chef Victor Liong of Lee Ho Fook has also mined nostalgia on occasion. “A couple of years ago [at Chinese New Year] we cooked from the Australian Women’s Weekly Chinese Cookbook. It was good fun and really well received,” he says. “But I didn’t want to go down that route [every day].” This is because, for those who didn’t grow up around the many faces of Chinese cuisine, we are still in a period of discovery when it comes to Chinese cooking. “It hasn’t quite got around for people to be like, ‘I really want that nostalgic honey prawn’,” he says. There are exceptions. “Queen Chow in Sydney does a really good job doing that, but Dan Hong is obviously doing it with a pretty serious dim sum offering as well. It’s highbrow, lowbrow, I guess.” The Australian Women’s Weekly cookbook experiment had value for Liong because it helped explore stories of the Australian Chinese experience. “There’s a recipe in [that book] called I think, Billy Kee’s pork ribs.” He says the dish was “basically a sweet soy pork ribs-type dish”. But it was “named after this guy who had a Chinese restaurant and had a really, really interesting life … It’s cool to delve into that a little bit more, and try and tie that into what it looks like on our menu.” For Young, who also has a popular riff on pie floaters and devilled livers, the joy of reviving a retro recipe is subverting expectations. “I love the idea of taking things that have fallen out of relevance, and seem really bizarre and bunky, that wouldn’t seem appetising at all and then making them really approachable and really delicious.”",Lifestyle/Food,"‘Old-school, 1950s grandma food’: Australian chefs on reviving retro recipes",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/08/old-school-1950s-grandma-food-australian-chefs-on-reviving-retro-recipes
4/8/2022,"Australian Border Force officials searched 822 travellers’ mobile phones in 2021, despite admitting it has no power to force arrivals to give them the passcode to their devices. In January, Sydney software developer James told Guardian Australia that he and his partner were stopped on their return from Fiji by border force officials who asked them to write their phone passcodes on a piece of paper before taking the codes and their phones to another room to examine for half an hour. The phones were then returned and they were allowed to leave. Border force confirmed the practice was allowed under the Customs Act, but declined to expand on how often it was used, or what officers did with the devices once unlocked. In tabled responses to questions on notice from Labor’s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, border force confirmed that in 2021 – when international travel was still limited during the Covid pandemic – officers searched 822 devices at the border, out of more than a million arriving or departing travellers. In a written response to questions raised by the Greens digital rights spokesperson, Nick McKim, border force has confirmed there is no legal obligation for people to hand over their passcodes. “There is no legal compulsion for a traveller to provide a password/passcode or provide assistance to an electronic device at the border,” border force said. But if a person refuses to comply with the request and a border force officer considers there to be “a risk to the border” then border force can seize the device for further examination.

Border force said a phone would only be seized where officers suspect it has “special forfeited goods” such as “illegal pornography, terrorism-related material and media that has been, or would be, refused classification”. McKim said border force officials should be required to get a warrant before going through people’s phones. “It’s generally the requirement in Australia and it should be no different at the border,” he said. “Australia’s privacy protections need considerable strengthening so people’s phones aren’t examined on a hunch, or confiscated under the shadow of being referred to other authorities.” McKim said there needs to be more transparency from border force about what data had been collected from the searches, who has access to it and how it is stored. Border force said devices were scanned by another device, rather than manually checked by officers. “Only trained ABF officers will undertake examinations of electronic devices,” border force said. “The examination process involves the connection of the device to examination equipment and the review of the data stored on the device to determine a subsequent course of action.” Travellers cannot be present during the examination “for operational and security reasons”.

4/8/2022,"Craig Kelly is being investigated for billing taxpayers to fly to anti-vaccine mandate, anti-lockdown rallies in Melbourne, internal records show. Kelly, the leader of the United Australia party, charged taxpayers for his flights to and from Melbourne for two rallies in November and December last year, which were organised chiefly as protests against Victoria’s pandemic powers and the Victorian premier, Dan Andrews. The rallies were also used to protest Covid vaccination generally, particularly for children, and vaccine passports. Kelly was a prominent figure at both rallies. At the first protest, Kelly told the crowd that Australia was being “governed by medical bureaucrats that are part of a mad, insane cult” and said the UAP would “bring Daniel Andrews to his knees” after the next election. At the second rally, Kelly complained that he was unable to hire a rental car because he “refused to show his Covid-19 vaccine certificate” and said he was “no longer in a great city, I am here in a fascist medical state”. The Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea) is probing whether Kelly, as a “backbench parliamentarian with a suburban Sydney electorate”, was allowed to charge taxpayers for the flights to Melbourne. It is also investigating his use of the government car service Comcar to travel from Melbourne airport on the day of the first rally. The watchdog began investigating Kelly’s travel after media reports about his speeches in Melbourne. “Upon investigation it was found that parliamentary business resources were used by Mr Kelly to travel to Melbourne on 13 November 2021 (returning same day) and on 3 December 2021 (returning 5 December 2021),” an initial assessment, released under freedom of information laws, found. “On the basis of the findings of this preliminary assessment, and in accordance with IPEA’s protocol on dealing with misuse of parliamentary work expenses, it is recommended IPEA proceeds with an assurance review into this matter to determine the dominant purpose of Mr Kelly’s use of travel resources.” The Guardian understands Ipea’s investigation is ongoing. Kelly said his travel was clearly parliamentary business. He said he had a private member’s bill before federal parliament on vaccine passports at the time, and was the leader of the UAP, speaking on national issues. “I was lobbying support for that [private member’s bill] across the nation,” he told the Guardian. “If that’s not parliamentary business, nothing is.” “If I was any member of parliament, such a large public rally would be parliamentary business that you went to it. The fact that I had a private member’s bill, or a couple of private members’ bills before parliament at that stage, I think makes it a direct [matter of parliamentary business].” “It wasn’t a conference on Hamilton Island or something like that.” Kelly said he had kept his costs down by flying economy to Melbourne and returning on the same day. “Sydney to Melbourne, Melbourne to Brisbane, I always fly economy, because I think that’s what the public would expect of a parliamentary backbencher,” he said. It is unclear how much Kelly charged taxpayers for the flights and Comcar. Ipea is yet to publicly release data for the last quarter of 2021 and the internal records do not show how much the flights cost.",News/Australia news,Craig Kelly billed taxpayers to fly to Melbourne anti-lockdown rallies ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/craig-kelly-billed-taxpayers-to-fly-to-melbourne-anti-lockdown-rallies
4/8/2022,"Australia has rolled back a ban on exporting sheep to the Middle East during the hottest months of the year in a move animal rights groups say ignores scientific recommendations introduced to protect animal welfare. The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment announced adjustments to the summer export ban this week, based on climatological data that it said resulted in an increased risk of heat stress in the Persian Gulf in May, and reduced risk of heat stress for sheep travelling through the Red Sea in early June. The live export of sheep to most ports in the Middle East is banned from 1 June to 14 September. But Australian exporters will be allowed to take sheep through the Red Sea to Israel from 1 to 14 June. The ban on exporting to some Persian Gulf destinations, including Qatar but not the major live export ports of Oman and Kuwait, will begin a week early on 22 May. Dr Jed Goodfellow from the Australian Alliance for Animals said the changes were contrary to the findings of a heat stress review commissioned by the government, and could result in sheep deaths. The McCarthy review, commissioned after whistleblower footage showing sheep panting and experiencing heat stress during a deadly voyage on the Awassi Express in August 2017, identified heat stress as a risk on all shipments occurring between May and October. The summer export ban, first introduced in 2019, has only ever run from June to September, to allow Australia’s two remaining live sheep exporters access to key global markets. Goodfellow said allowing sheep to be exported through the Red Sea in June would push them to their “biological limit” and risked a significant mortality event. “You get one adverse weather event, temperatures higher than expected, and basically half of the sheep on the ship could die,” he said. Goodfellow said the adjustment to the summer ban, which followed lobbying from exporters, showed that the trade would not be able to exist if all the scientific advice around reducing heat stress was followed. “It just shows the fact that the trade is fundamentally incompatible with acceptable welfare standards,” he said. “The business model is based on a degree of animal suffering, because if you act on the science and in accordance with animal welfare the trade becomes unviable very very quickly.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The agriculture department in February announced it would be conducting “additional stakeholder engagement” on its review of live sheep exports during the Middle Eastern summer, which is expected to be completed by the end of June. It also said it was funding ongoing research by LiveCorp and the export industry, which “will further ascertain and align sheep physiological and behavioural changes observed during a voyage with other data”. “This will include additional onboard data collection including using automated rumen data loggers to continuously measure sheep core body temperature,” it said. The chief executive of RSPCA Australia, Richard Mussell, said there was no need to conduct additional research. “All the data and evidence is already there – it’s just being dismissed,” he said. “Live export does not enable the most basic of animal welfare needs.” Mussell said the decision to wind back part of the summer ban was “deeply concerning”. “It’s also very worrying that these regulations have been put in place now, on the eve of a federal election being called – when parliament may not sit again for months and so may not have the chance to scrutinise these last-minute changes,” he said. Animals Australia director Lyn White said the three-month ban was “already grossly inadequate” and reducing it would “increase the perils sheep will face”. Greens senator, Mehreen Faruqui, said it was concerning that the change had been made without parliamentary oversight. “The Senate has been denied the opportunity to do its job in scrutinising these changes and considering whether to disallow them before they come into effect,” she said.",News/Australia news,Australia relaxes summer ban on live sheep exports to Middle East ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/australia-relaxes-summer-ban-on-live-sheep-exports-to-middle-east
4/8/2022,"The lives of women in their twenties and thirties are ripe for unpacking: it’s a time of great change, personal epiphanies and coming into one’s own. Over the past few years, the enormous popularity of Sally Rooney and her ilk proves that there is a constant hunger for these stories, especially since the ugly truths and minutiae of women’s lives have historically been sidelined. From covers to content, “sad girl lit” is undoubtedly a current literary trend. It almost always centre on white, heterosexual, middle-class women; while their struggles are valid, they’ve got a lot to fall back on. Some of the books in this field are startlingly original and insightful – Meg Mason’s 2020 novel Sorrow and Bliss is a wry, intelligent exploration of living with mental illness – and some follow a more predictable trajectory of overcoming adversity to find contentment. Melbourne novelist Genevieve Novak’s debut No Hard Feelings slots neatly into the second category. It follows Penny Moore, a typical 26-year-old who lives in an inner-city sharehouse and works under a punishing micromanager at a digital marketing agency. She drinks too much. She spends endless hours swiping on dating apps. She is hopelessly in love with an ex-boyfriend, who sees her as a convenient hookup. Her longtime best friends are making strides in their lives: Annie is a lawyer with a promising new girlfriend, and Bec has recently become engaged. While once their trio seemed unbreakable, Penny feels as if she’s falling behind. The novel is a laundry list of Melbourne hotspots and cultural references: Novak namechecks inner-northern pubs and bars, indie bands and TV shows. The ex is a laughable cliche: a PhD student with a passion for Radiohead, vinyl, Doc Martens and op-shopped clothing. And the scenes at Penny’s workplace are excruciating in their replication of digital marketing jargon, especially when written in email form. If it weren’t so incredibly earnest, much of it could read as parody – and I say that as someone who is very much a part of this world. To Novak’s credit, she works some diversity into her novel in a way that mostly feels natural. Penny’s friends are queer and people of colour (facts mentioned only in passing or through implication), and there’s a self-awareness in the characters that reflects the shifting social tides. But this sometimes reads like shallow buzzword regurgitation, such as when Penny thinks: “I have such respect for an ethically sound company led almost exclusively by women, several of them women of colour.” Like so many women in so many of these books, Penny is a hot mess. She is a master of self-sabotage. Her inner monologue is often unkind, to herself and to others; there are various instances of fatphobia throughout the novel, and perhaps they are there to illustrate the vapid concerns of twentysomethings, but it is still uncomfortable to read. Penny’s solipsism is not unique – it’s largely the driving force of these very interior novels. But given the ubiquity of this kind of writing at the moment, it all starts feeling like white noise rather than profound insight. The rise of therapy among millennials makes its way into this novel in a way that’s more gratifying. Penny’s sessions with her psychologist Dr Minnick call to mind the patient-doctor relationship in the excellent television show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Dr Minnick’s dialogue sometimes reads like a self-help book, but Novak’s intent is admirable. There are many similarities to British author Dolly Alderton’s 2020 novel Ghosts, not least the fact that the elusive objects of both protagonists’ affections share a first name. Like Penny, Alderton’s narrator Nina finds herself casting unfair judgment on her friends in light of her own romantic failures. The contrast is that Nina’s journey ends not with romance, but acceptance that her life may not mirror the conventional path. Nina, though, is in her early thirties – what a difference a few years may make. While Penny concedes by the end of No Hard Feelings that rewards can be found in new beginnings, or simply living in the moment, and not only in fairytale endings, her happiness still comes from external sources: a steady boyfriend, a higher-paying job. Perhaps this is simply the reality of living under capitalism in the west – even when emotional peace is the goal, these traditional arbiters of success continue to signify a satisfying ending.

4/8/2022,"In the near-decade since Spiderbait last released an album, their bass player and singer, Janet English, has completed a bachelor’s degree in psychology. She’s not sure if she wants to practise. “I was just really interested in how the brain works,” she says. English is the owner of one of the most interesting brains in Australian music. At school, she excelled as a gymnast as well as at hockey, mime, theatre and art, before forming Spiderbait in 1991 with singing drummer Mark Maher (better known as Kram) and guitarist Damian Whitty (Whitt) in the Riverina town of Finley, New South Wales. Kram was an accomplished musician but, back then, English could barely make it from one end of a song to the other. “She’s kind of an accidental hero in a way,” Kram says. “She was a painter and artist who sort of stumbled into music through her friends and then discovered that she had these incredible talents.” Kram talks like he plays drums, at an overdriven mile a minute. English is more reticent. With Spiderbait marking their 30th anniversary last year, Kram had an idea: to celebrate English’s work in a single 33-track compilation, Songs in the Key of J. It features almost everything English has contributed to the band. That includes many of their most loved tunes, sung in English’s distinctively high and soft register: the acoustic-electric pop thrash of Calypso, the winking Fucken Awesome, and the glorious Jackson Five homage Stevie – songs that walked a tightwire of whimsy and cynicism, naivety and irony, humour and melancholy. It’s unusual for a group with three distinctive songwriters to release a single member’s work in one package. Most bands argue – and many break up – over songwriting credits, royalties and egos. But Spiderbait share everything equally, a trait of other bands with longevity on their side, including U2. English was not keen when Kram floated the idea but figured it would be one of many Spiderbait ideas that never came to fruition. “I have to credit Kram, he’s such a champion,” English says. “He’s an amazing musician but he’s so open to other people’s input, and respectful of what they bring to the table.” The band’s inclusive spirit was a product of the punk and hardcore scene from which they emerged. “We went and saw Dinosaur Jr in 1989 and they had a woman playing bass [Donna Dresch],” English says. “I think it was one of those nights where it felt like half of Melbourne tumbled out of the Prince of Wales [hotel] and went, ‘Let’s form a band.’” They quickly became indie-radio favourites and mainstays of the festival circuit. Their third album, Ivy and the Big Apples, released in 1996, went double platinum; its Kram-written lead single, Buy Me a Pony, topped the Triple J Hottest 100 poll, making Spiderbait the first Australian band to achieve the feat. The group pulled back a little after that. “I remember feeling like the gigs were getting out of hand, I was a bit over it all and I just wanted to retreat back into the studio,” English says. Their next album, Grand Slam, saw her dabbling with electronica and “all the pop stuff I grew up with in the late 70s and early 80s”. Sales dipped and, after 2001’s The Flight of Wally Funk, recordings became sparse: Tonight Alright, which featured their hit cover of Black Betty, was released in 2004, then nine years passed until a self-titled follow-up. Geography has played a part: English lives in Melbourne, Whitt in Ballarat and Kram near Byron Bay, where his home was just flooded. Kram says Songs in the Key of J is the second instalment of a trilogy of releases. The first was a reissue of Ivy and the Big Apples for its 25th anniversary. The third will be a new album, to be cut this year. “We’re having this beautiful renaissance on stage and we feel like we need to do the same thing on record,” Kram says. But for now, he says, it’s all about English. “She’s one of the greats of Australian music to me, and I think me and Whitt benefited from playing with her as much as she did with us,” Kram says. He draws a parallel with Magic Dirt’s Adalita, with whom Spiderbait played often: “The two of them are like the sun and the moon.” He describes Songs in the Key of J as akin to a solo album but in the context of Spiderbait. It’s probably the closest English will ever come to making one. “I’ve got creative control, I’ve got two amazing collaborators, so there hasn’t been that burning George Harrison post-Beatles desire to just show everyone,” she says. “I’ve been very lucky in that regard.” Songs in the Key of J is out now through Universal",Arts/Music,Spiderbait celebrate bandmate Janet English: ‘She’s one of the greats of Australian music’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/08/spiderbait-celebrate-bandmate-janet-english-shes-one-of-the-greats-of-australian-music
4/8/2022,"Boris Johnson claimed on Thursday that his energy security strategy had delivered “clean, affordable, secure power to the people for generations to come”. In comments issued as he launched the policy at Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset and put atomic energy front and centre of his plan, the prime minister said his government was the first for years that had not “dodged the big decisions on energy”. Yet within hours, critics spoke of a lack of ambition, particularly around onshore wind and energy efficiency, avenues that experts say offer the best and quickest hope of bringing down bills and achieving energy self-sufficiency. So what exactly is in the plan and what is missing from it? Peak winter electricity demand is about 60 gigawatts and National Grid expects that to be 85GW by 2050, as vehicles and home heating are increasingly electrified, with a safety buffer needed on top of that. Johnson has set a target of 25% of electricity coming from nuclear. That means increasing capacity from 7GW to 24GW by 2050, an effort to be overseen by a new body, Great British Nuclear. The first phase will involve eight new nuclear reactors, equivalent to four 3GW power stations. Sizewell C is set for approval within this parliamentary term. Two more will follow in the next, with Wylfa on Anglesey the front-runner. After that, projects could be located at approved sites such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. Small nuclear reactors of nearly 0.5GW each will be part of the mix, with both Rolls-Royce and GE Hitachi working on projects. The recently approved “regulated asset base” funding model will transfer risk to the taxpayer, allaying risk-aversion among private firms, which has stymied recent development. Ministers have not ruled out taking a stake in individual plants. There will, however, be no nuclear power plants in Scotland, whose parliament has reaffirmed its opposition. “We will be the Saudi Arabia of wind power,” the government claims. Offshore wind targets have been scaled up, from 40GW to 50GW, with planning reforms intended to cut delivery times, which can be up to 13 years. But Tory infighting has turned onshore into a sore point. A leaked version of the energy plan, first reported by the i newspaper, include a target of 45GW by 2035, up from nearly 15GW now. That disappeared in the final document, after anti-wind Tory MPs refused to countenance overhauling planning laws that make onshore all but impossible to develop in England. The government says it will look at offering local communities cheaper electricity bills in return for their consent but will not rip up those obstructive planning rules. No such prohibition exists in Scotland, which is better suited to onshore than England thanks to greater wind speeds and more remote locations. In a TV clip at Hinkley Point C, Johnson said onshore turbines were “controversial with people”. “People feel that they affect the beauty of the countryside, I totally understand that.” However, polling by YouGov in 2021 shows two thirds of people support onshore wind projects, even in rural areas. Solar is in line for one of the biggest expansions. The plan envisages a fivefold increase that could take the total capacity from 14GW to 70GW by 2035. Unlike onshore wind, this could be underpinned by planning reform that favours development on non-protected sites. The energy security plan contains no major new investment in upgrading leaky homes to make them easier and cheaper to heat, despite the price of gas – the heat source for 90% of homes – hitting historic highs. As recently as 2012, the UK was upgrading 2.3m homes a year thanks to government funding that was cut when David Cameron vowed to eliminate “green crap”, slowing the rate to a trickle. The energy security plan offers very little to reignite that drive to insulate the UK, enraging environmental groups. The government’s renewable proposals have been accompanied by firmer support for oil and gas, further inflaming the ire of environmentalists. North Sea drillers will be encouraged to seek new licences, although the government hasn’t quantified what impact it expects this to have on production. Having banned fracking in 2019, the government will commission an “impartial” review by the British Geological Survey into whether it can be done safely.",News/Business,"What is Boris Johnson’s energy plan, and what is it missing?",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/what-is-boris-johnson-energy-plan-and-what-is-it-missing
4/8/2022,"John Harris’s article rightly pointed out that the government “seems split between indifference and paralysed panic” in its response to the “economic calamity being loaded on to the poorest people” (‘Cost of living crisis’? No – this is a social emergency that will define who we are, 3 April). I would argue that its response can be characterised by a mixture of cynicism and inertia that sees it behind the curve on almost every front, not just the cost-of-living bombshell. Cynicism because Rishi Sunak believes that he only needs to throw a few crumbs to “hard-working” families now and save the real loaf as a pre-election bribe to voters. Surely it must be obvious to voters, as well as to Tory backbenchers, that Sunak simply does not get it? And how could he be expected to, when his family fortune runs into hundreds of millions? If only the government would instead call in Martin Lewis. He does get that the poorest and the vulnerable are suffering the worst right now; he cares about their plight; he would know which economic levers to pull to help; and he would put windfall tax revenue to good use now, not in early 2024.Andy JinmanWorthing, West Sussex  John Harris’s excellent exposé of poverty in the UK points out that absolute poverty is defined as being “a household income less than 60% of the median income level of 2010-11, adjusted for inflation”. However, this definition is self-evidently couched in relative terms. If it is to have a real and distinct meaning, “absolute poverty” should be used to refer to an extreme applying universally to human circumstances regardless of place and time, and to the inability to satisfy the most basic human needs where survival is threatened. This is not to underplay the importance of seeking to improve the conditions of poor people, however defined, but the erosion of conceptual distinction in the use of these terms, by the same kind of inflation of outrage that escalates mass murder to “genocide”, erodes their meaning and therefore undermines the power of advocacy associated with them.Stephen SmithGlasgow  I was incensed to read your story about the non-dom tax status of the chancellor’s wife, which allows her to save millions in tax (6 April). Her reported share dividend income of £11.5m a year equates to about £22 a minute. Perhaps these startling numbers explain why the chancellor cannot comprehend the difficulties faced by the majority of people in the UK. As people are forced with having to choose between eating or heating, just imagine what it must be like to accrue £660 while watching Corrie. What a missed opportunity that Ed Miliband’s proposal to scrap non-dom status, part of his 2015 election manifesto, did not gain the support of the British public.Nigel HayRoke, Oxfordshire  How heartwarming to read of Rishi Sunak’s generous donation to his old school (Report, 5 April). Perhaps he didn’t realise that most public schools already benefit from the tax breaks and rate relief that come with charitable status, and if funds are getting a bit low they can always sell off a chunk of surplus land for development, as Winchester college has done. It’s a mystery to me how any organisation that charges enormous fees for its services, whether in the education or health sectors, can be classed as anything other than businesses and taxed accordingly. So next time Sunak has a bit of spare cash to dish out, I suggest he considers a genuine charity like Winchester Basics Bank, which is working round the clock to help the rapidly rising number of families with a “eat or heat” dilemma.Karen BarrattWinchester  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/8/2022,"Crawley Town have been taken over by a group of cryptocurrency investors who are promising to bring “Web3’s most innovative ideas” to the League Two club. Wagmi United, a US consortium who had previously been linked with a deal to buy Bradford City, confirmed their revolution in West Sussex after taking a controlling stake in Crawley from the Turkish steel magnate Ziya Eren. Crawley are currently mid-table in English football’s fourth tier and their most recent set of accounts revealed the club to be half a million pounds in debt. But the new owners, backed by funding from prominent US internet entrepreneurs, have ambitions for promotion and promise to increase fan engagement through digital tokens. “Crawley Town Football Club is a club with more than 125 years of rich history that we revere and respect,” said Preston Johnson, one of Wagmi United’s founders. “However, a conventional approach to ownership hasn’t worked, and the club is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds while fans suffer through year after year of uninspiring results on the pitch. “We think the club can do better and our fans deserve better. Sports are supposed to be fun and bring communities together. At Crawley Town, we’re going to shake up the status quo, try out some new ideas, and build a worldwide community of fans.” Johnson and his fellow Wagmi founder Eben Smith are both enthusiasts for NFTs – digital tokens that are increasingly ubiquitous in sport but have been controversial due to speculative trading in their value. It appears Wagmi’s plan is to sell NFTs that will allow buyers to take decisions in the club while also generating revenue. Smith has cited one possible use of the NFTs to be the opportunity for fans to remove him as a club director should Crawley not be promoted to League One in two years. “We might run for reelection,” Smith said, “but we don’t just get to hold the fanbase hostage because our dad invented Cablevision.” Cablevision was an American television provider that went out of business in 2016.",Sport/Football,‘We’re going to shake up the status quo’: cryptocurrency group take over Crawley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/crawley-town-taken-over-wagmi-united-cryptocurrency-shake-up-status-quo
4/8/2022,"Rishi Sunak sounded every inch the gallant, protective husband. His wife, Akshata Murty, hadn’t asked to be in the public eye, the chancellor told the BBC plaintively, and he had found it “very upsetting” when she was targeted. Her money was her money, and the stake she held in the multibillion-pound family business Infosys – which was then still doing brisk trade in Moscow even as Sunak exhorted companies to cut ties with Russia – was strictly her affair, not his. After all, isn’t every woman entitled to a professional life independent from her husband’s? The chancellor even wryly compared himself to the actor Will Smith, who lashed out at the comedian Chris Rock after the latter joked about his wife’s hair, as if being reportedly richer than the Queen was just Akshata’s rotten luck too. Only now it turns out there’s another, somewhat less endearing theory for why the chancellor might be anxious to move on from the subject of her fortune, and it’s that she doesn’t pay British tax on a chunk of it. Taxes are rising for millions of Britons this month, but in the Sunak household, well, maybe not so much. For Murty has been revealed as a non-dom: she pays British taxes on any earnings in this country but not on any income overseas, a perfectly legal choice but one that could conceivably have saved the Sunak household a tidy sum. And, to be clear, it is a choice, much as her husband’s decision not to uprate benefits this month in line with unexpectedly soaring inflation was a choice. Murty retains Indian citizenship. That’s something she has every right to do, just as Nick Clegg’s wife, Miriam, had every right to remain a proud Spanish citizen when he was in government. But tax experts argue that the chancellor’s wife could have opted to pay tax in the country where her husband sets it. That she didn’t is, arguably, not surprising: in the circles in which she moves, it might seem crazy to risk the family inheritance just to spare a husband’s political blushes. What really is astonishing, however, is that the chancellor seemingly imagined he could keep all this private, even while hiking taxes on people with nowhere to run from them. There are few more damaging charges in politics than “one rule for them, another for the rest of us”, as Boris Johnson so helpfully demonstrated by presiding over a regime that repeatedly broke its own Covid rules. Yet his supposed heir apparent has just walked straight into the same elephant trap. Plenty of Conservative voters can cope with a leader who is cheerfully and unashamedly rolling in it, even in the middle of a crippling squeeze on living standards. Just look at the way they have indulged Jacob Rees-Mogg down the years. Nor should it prove impossible for a rich politician to govern well for the poor, given some capacity for human empathy and – call me a hopeless old romantic – the existence of data. Politicians who actually listen to the evidence in front of them and choose advisers capable of filling in their blind spots can and often do transcend their own narrow personal experiences; for anyone aspiring to lead a whole country, that’s literally the job description. But what all voters can smell a mile off is politicians trying to pass themselves off as what they’re not, and Sunak’s everyman act is now wearing decidedly thin. Borrowing a suitably humble-looking hatchback off a supermarket worker instead of using one of his own more luxurious cars for a post-budget photo opportunity at the petrol pumps was clumsy but understandable, given that chancellors normally travel courtesy of a government driver. But failing to clarify his wife’s tax arrangements in public, awkward as that might make dinner with the in-laws, is in a different league. Non-dom status was a major political dividing line at the 2015 election, and Ed Miliband threatened to scrap it if Labour won. Scrapping or restricting it has been at least a theoretical option for Sunak, too, at every budget or spring statement he has delivered. How long did the chancellor imagine he could avoid disclosing this very personal interest in public? What else do we not know about his wife’s finances? And without full disclosure, how can we be sure his family circumstances aren’t shaping his decisions, even subconsciously? For Sunak, all this is hideously toxic. So toxic, indeed, that he could be forgiven for wondering where the constant drip, drip, drip of damaging information about his gilded lifestyle – the £335 trainers in which he was recently photographed, the £100,000 personal donation the Sunak-Murtys have made to his old public school – could be coming from, as the Metropolitan police’s Partygate inquiry wends its way inexorably towards the prime minister’s door. The single biggest deterrent for despairing Tory MPs agonising over whether to trigger a leadership election is the fear of detonating something whose outcome they can’t control or predict. If Sunak no longer looks like a sure thing, a reliable plan B likely to be accepted across the party, then putting in a letter to the 1922 committee becomes an altogether wilder roll of the dice. But the truth is that whatever dark arts are being practised in dark corners, Sunak’s star has been quietly waning for a while. The chancellor’s job is to say no, but the Treasury’s tightfistedness at a time of huge demands on the state evidently grates on some colleagues. In the absence of a clear Tory agenda driven by the prime minister, Sunak hasn’t noticeably seized the opportunity to create one. His biggest remaining asset was his air of general wholesomeness, a sense that in contrast to his chaotic neighbour here was a devoted family man with no skeletons in his closets or wild, Covid-defying parties in his basement, and with sound political judgment to boot. But in failing to go on the front foot over what was always going to be the tricky issue of his family’s wealth, the chancellor has effectively dented his own brand. Faintly mad as this sounds, it now looks more likely than it did that Johnson will lead this government into the next election; that the greased piglet, in David Cameron’s immortal phrase, will wriggle free, if only because his party has run out of better ideas. If it all goes pear-shaped, Sunak will doubtless have other options. What a shame the rest of the country can’t say the same.

4/8/2022,"Platforms that connect buyers and sellers such as Airbnb and eBay must do more to protect consumers from scams, according to the comedian and TV presenter Joe Lycett, who accused them of pocketing the revenue but refusing to take responsibility for fraud. The presenter of Channel 4 consumer rights show Joe Lycett’s Got Your Back told peers that regulation, including the introduction of more rigorous checks, should pressure lucrative social media and sales platforms into helping customers who regularly lose thousands of pounds in transactions with fake sellers . Speaking to the House of Lords digital fraud committee, he said: “I think the biggest sector that we think could do better are the platforms. “These platforms are often making a lot of money … they should be obliged to do more in that area.”He described the typical response from platforms as: “Well, it’s kind of nothing to do with us, we’ve just offered the platform on which you meet and find these businesses, but if you get scammed it’s nothing to do with us.” Lycett said his TV show’s team had set up a fake account for the chief executive of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, and a fraudulent listing for the Airbnb offices in London. “They didn’t check and they didn’t stop it. We turned up with the paperwork, and they didn’t like to see us, didn’t let us in,” he said. He also criticised banks for failing to protect consumers from increasingly sophisticated scams, citing the example of one woman who lost thousands of pounds after scammers texted her from NatWest’s official phone number, meaning messages arrived within an existing thread with her bank, a scam also replicated in phone calls from legitimate numbers. “[NatWest’s] argument was, ‘We can’t stop people pretending to be something they’re not because they were very sophisticated in how they did it,’” he said. Many banks have signed up to a voluntary code that reimburses blameless victims who are tricked into transferring money, but critics say this is applied inconsistently. Lycett said: “It is kind of at [the banks’] discretion whether they refund their customers who have been scammed.” He added it was a “little bit too easy” to open a bank account without too many questions being asked, and that personal data was widely available online to buy for as little as 20p. Lycett also told peers his TV programme would never have been commissioned if Channel 4 had not existed, because most commercial broadcasters would consider it too risky from a legal perspective. Asked what he had been most surprised by in the three years since the show started, he said the volume and sophistication of scams, with the cases that appear on the show representing a tiny fraction of the stories the producers receive. He added that although the stereotypical scammed victim was an older person less familiar with modern technology, in reality rates were much higher for younger people aged 16 to 34. Complex romantic scams in which victims are groomed over a period of months, such as the fraud depicted in the Netflix series The Tinder Swindler, are also on the rise, he said. Lycett said it was crucial that more was done to stop scammers – who often operate abroad and are difficult for police to track down and prosecute – because fraud “absolutely ruins people’s lives”.",Lifestyle/Money,Joe Lycett: sites such as Airbnb and eBay must do more to stop scams,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/07/joe-lycett-sites-airbnb-ebay-more-stop-scams
