1/15/2022,"It is unlikely that West Ham would have signed Jarrod Bowen had they decided to give Manuel Pellegrini one more transfer window. Every attempt to convince Pellegrini to move for Bowen had fallen on deaf ears, with the Chilean insistent that the winger was not good enough for the Premier League, and the club’s recruitment department probably would have had to accept defeat had the board chosen not to change managers at the end of 2019. After all West Ham were not the only top-flight side monitoring a talent whose performances for Hull had marked him out as one of the best forwards in the Championship. Crystal Palace and Newcastle also had Bowen on their radar and West Ham, who had replaced Pellegrini with David Moyes, were in danger of missing out as the January transfer window drew to a close.  Diligent when it comes to buying players, Moyes had not had much time to work out what his new squad required to avoid relegation. The Scot knew that he needed more pace in attack, but he could not make up his mind on Bowen. Could the youngster make an instant impact? Was he fast enough to get away from Premier League full-backs? Yet time was running out. Palace and Newcastle were making moves and other figures at West Ham urged Moyes to act. The prevailing view at the London Stadium was that signing Bowen would pay off and so, with the deadline approaching, West Ham jumped in, agreed a £22m fee with Hull and managed to get the deal done just in the nick of time. “We were attracted to the goals he has scored over the years,” said Moyes, whose decision to take a risk on Bowen looks anything but misguided now. West Ham, who have gone from relegation candidates to contenders for Champions League qualification, cannot get enough of the 25-year-old’s relentless running, bending crosses, team ethic and hunger for goals. Bowen has established himself as one of the sharpest forwards in the top flight and even Moyes, who tends not to go overboard when he praises his players, agrees that the former Hull man would not look out of place in the England squad. “When players come from the Championship you hope they will develop and Jarrod has taken to it really well,” Moyes said after Bowen’s double helped West Ham beat Norwich 2-0 on Wednesday. “When you look at the competition for England – Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish, Jadon Sancho – it’s a decision for Gareth Southgate. But he’s getting closer.” As Moyes acknowledged, it will not be easy for Bowen to force his way into England’s plans before the World Cup. The squad is settled and Southgate is not short of options. Moyes did not even mention Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Emile Smith Rowe, who made his debut in November; Bowen, to put it bluntly, could well be fighting a losing battle. Yet the West Ham winger should not be discounted. Bowen has been directly involved in 16 goals in all competitions this season (eight goals and eight assists), more than any other English player in the Premier League, and is a regular source of inspiration for Moyes’s side on the right flank. “It’s all about progressing,” Bowen said after scoring in West Ham’s 2-0 victory over Leeds in the FA Cup last weekend. “Whether that is assists or goals, they are the main two things you look at as a winger. Mo Salah is the perfect example, the goals he scores and assists he gets since he joined Liverpool. He is definitely one that I look at.” As it happens Liverpool have been looking at Bowen. Jürgen Klopp sees him as a potential backup for Salah and could try to sign him this summer – not that West Ham, who are fourth before hosting Leeds on Sunday, are likely to welcome offers for one of their most important players. Bowen, who has helped West Ham reach the last 16 of the Europa League, has become invaluable. His versatility enables him to play through the middle when Michail Antonio is missing, but he is at his best on the right. Bowen’s left foot allows him to cause havoc with inswinging crosses, he can be relied on to track back to protect his full-back and he is always willing to get into goalscoring positions, even though his finishing could be more refined at times. Moyes often speaks about Bowen, who could have scored five against Norwich, needing to become more clinical. Yet part of Bowen’s appeal is that he never stops going. He scores all types of goals – he beat taller defenders to open the scoring with a header against Norwich – and does not let his head drop when he misses easy chances. It is not part of Bowen’s character to give up. As a teenager he had an unsuccessful trial at Cardiff City and he went six months unpaid during a spell at Hereford, who were strapped for cash at the time, but he refused to let go of his dream. Bowen kept finding ways to improve and that spirit, that refusal to roll over, is still with him now. It does not matter if people write him off: Bowen has fought his way to the top and his rise is far from over.",Sport/Football,West Ham’s punt on Jarrod Bowen is blooming into a solid investment,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/west-hams-punt-on-jarrod-bowen-is-blooming-into-a-solid-investment
1/15/2022," The album Mirages: The Art of French Song (Champs Hill), with the baritone Roderick Williams and pianist Roger Vignoles, grew out of a Wigmore Hall recital, recreating the intimacy and shape of a concert programme to delicious effect. In no area of repertoire, it seems, is Williams not at ease as well as expert. Recent Schubert song cycles (with pianist Iain Burnside) and English repertoire stand out in his varied discography. Now, with Vignoles as an ever idiomatic and responsive partner, he has turned to French song.  Opening with the sensual mystery of late Fauré – four songs, including Reflets dans l’eau and Danseuse – the duo steer gracefully to atmospheric ballads by Debussy’s friend André Caplet, spiky Arthur Honegger miniatures and Ravel in Spanish mood (Don Quichotte à Dulcinée). Williams’s own idiomatic, semi-declamatory Verlaine settings, Les ténèbres de l’amour (1994), form an effective bridge to more Honegger, Poulenc and, in perfect conclusion, Debussy’s Beau Soir.  Ennio Morricone, orchestrator, conductor, trumpeter but above all composer of scores for more than 400 films, died in 2020, aged 91. Had he stopped his cinema career after The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) or The Mission (1986), he would still be famous, his music plundered, borrowed, recreated in every genre from hip-hop and reggae to jazz and classical. A new album, Ennio Morricone: Cinema Suites for Violin and Orchestra (Arcana), conducted by his son Andrea Morricone, invites us to enter the dreamlike atmosphere of his scores as music alone, those haunting theme tunes given subtle orchestration and new colour. Performed by his longtime collaborator, violinist Marco Serino, with the Orchestra Haydn di Bolzano e Trento, it features arrangements Morricone had made since the 1980s, revising them late in his life. The process was interrupted by his death and finished, in tribute, by Serino. A must for film music devotees but interesting, too, as a testament.  The BBC Philharmonic’s concert from Manchester’s Bridgewater Hall, conducted by Ludovic Morlot, with Carolyn Sampson (soprano), explores the idea of home and away: Copland’s Letter from Home, Betsy Jolas’s Letters from Bachville, Dutilleux’s Correspondances and Dvořák’s Symphony No 9, “From the New World”.

1/15/2022,"Pioneers of the New Romantic movement, Spandau Ballet’s career launched in the late 70s within the walls of Blitz, an enigmatic club in Covent Garden known for influencing the sound and style of 80s pop. Formed by London school friends Gary Kemp, Tony Hadley, Steve Norman and John Keeble – and later Gary’s brother and former roadie Martin – Spandau Ballet went on to soundtrack the bombast and excess of the decade, selling 25m albums globally. Known for their bitter breakup – Tony, Steve and John launched an unsuccessful case against Gary for a share of the band’s songwriting royalties – they’ve since reformed but are now on hiatus. Martin has gone on to have a successful television career, while saxophonist Steve and his band, the Sleevz, celebrate the 40th anniversary of Spandau’s debut album with a UK tour later this year.  This was on the set of the video for To Cut a Long Story Short, our first single. I was 18 at the time and my face is very serious. We were stern young men who wanted to take over the world. But behind that mask we had the best laugh. I always thought of Spandau as five boys who went to Benidorm for 10 years. After this photo was taken, the single went on to sell about 400,000 copies and everything shot like a rocket. Before I joined the band, I used to tag along to some of my brother’s school parties. Steve would be there and I always liked him. He never treated me like I was younger or looked down on me. We became best friends really quickly. When the band went away in the early days, we had no money so I always shared a hotel room with him. There are lots of secrets from those days but sadly nothing that we are allowed to share publicly! My favourite days were right at the start when we were completely unknown, travelling the world and totally clueless. On our first trip to Germany, Steve said to me: “When we get there, I’m going to take you to a sauna!” At this point in the 80s, all of the saunas were mixed. I was just a teenager at the time, so sitting on the top shelf of a sauna looking down at these naked women, it felt like I’d landed on a different planet! After a while, Steve said: “Come outside, I want to show you something else.” There was this long trough full of pummel stones. He said I should get in it – according to Steve it was great for getting the dead skin off your feet. So there we are, both completely naked, walking up and down this trough, digging our feet into the stones, dead skin flying off, and all of a sudden this German woman bursts out of these double doors and shouts: “What are you doing? You are in my plant pot!” We weren’t even in the sauna any more, we were in the reception. Those memories beat anything like playing in front of 150,000 people in Madrid. Every friendship goes through ups and downs. It’s how you deal with it that’s important. My band dealt with it well for a certain amount of years, but we found it a struggle in the end. I have nothing against anyone in the band – if I saw Tony tomorrow, I would speak to him and love him the same as I do Steve today. If that’s reciprocated, I’m not sure, but I pretty much guarantee if we bumped into each other in a room, we would be laughing and joking within seconds. But what’s made mine and Steve’s friendship last so long is that we’ve never fought. We had a few years, during the court case, where we didn’t speak on the phone. Then there was the period of time in the 90s when I was having treatment for my brain tumour. I have no idea which friends came to visit, Steve might have been there, but all I remember is Shirlie [Holliman, Kemp’s wife]. It’s a big black hole in my head and it turned me from a boy into a man. But whatever has happened in my life, Steve and I still loved each other very much. Having fun was always core to Spandau, and when I think of Steve, in my head he is laughing. He hasn’t changed an inch. Inside and out. He still fits into that kilt! When this was taken, we represented a huge, burgeoning movement. We rocked up at the London Dungeon to shoot the video – it was before they tarted it up and made it into a theme park. It really was quite scary. There was an incongruousness to seeing our look against that kind of decay. We felt like we were smashing our way through the doors into the future. The first time I met Martin he was 13 – I’d popped over to Gary’s family home, off the Essex Road. They shared a room at the time: Gary had posters of Bowie, and on the other side, Martin had Bruce Lee. I was into both of them. We got on straight away. Before the band got properly big, both of us spent a lot of time in the arcades playing Space Invaders. We had odd jobs, like handing out magazines at Chancery Lane, but were skint, so we’d drink at home before going out. I had a beer-making kit and a couple of pints of it was like rocket fuel. Or we’d nick a bottle of Martin’s dad’s homemade wine which was lethal. One time we were drinking that stuff all afternoon, and decided to head off to Exmouth Market. I can’t remember too much; we went to a pub, and there was a stripper. We were meant to be going to Blitz – it was the time when people were popping pills, so I got us some Pro Plus tablets instead. The next thing I know it’s the next day and we’re passed out in a tiny little park in town, being woken up by a homeless guy who’s saying we’re sleeping on his bench. Martin was a sweetheart back then and still is. To this day he’s never been in a fight in his life. Well, I’ve seen him in one with his brother in the early 80s and it was handbags at dawn. No punching, just flapping. Spandau were always gentlemanly but when it came to bolshiness, we were right at the front, sticking up for each other. We’re coming! Better move! We were mob-handed in that respect. We needed to be, as what we wore was quite shocking – on trains people would stand and stare like we were aliens. The band that fell to Earth. Then, soon enough, Princess Di was wearing frilly collars and it had hit the mainstream. Even though I never treated him like a younger brother, I always looked after Martin – I still do. He’s a popular man. Since he was in EastEnders, people often approach him when we’re out together, so I tend to step in and say: “No autographs! He’s got to go!” I love it. I’d hate to have the fame he’s got. I’m surprised he can handle it because he is such a shy man. At the peak of Spandau’s fame, we’d be touring together for the best part of a year. We’d desperately need space from each after we got back home. But back in the day Martin and me had girlfriends who knew each other, so once our bags were unpacked, he’d give me a bell and say: “Steve, do you fancy going for a pint and a curry with the girls?” I’d reply: “I’ll see you in an hour!” I’m never tired of Martin. Never anyone in the band, but least of all him.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Martin Kemp and Steve Norman of Spandau Ballet look back: ‘We were stern young men who wanted to take over the world’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/flashback-martin-kemp-steve-norman-spandau-ballet
1/15/2022,"“We tell ourselves stories in order to live,” wrote the late, great Joan Didion. But what if the narratives we compulsively weave end up being the death of us? Another 335 deaths within 28 days of a diagnosis of Covid were recorded on Thursday, even as the pandemic is being dismissed as essentially over by many in the government and media. “Endemicity” is the new virological watchword of 2022, meaning – at least when touted by those opposed to Covid restrictions – the mutation of Sars-CoV-2 into something so mild and weedy it is no more threatening than a common cold. Yet 335 deaths are an entire jumbo jet’s worth of people, crashing from the sky above. Has it really taken less than two years to become inured to such dizzying daily casualties? Perhaps, if we are honest with ourselves, what herd immunity really means is our newfound capacity to render ourselves emotionally untouched by – immune to – mass loss of life. The departed as no more than a hum of background noise.  Medics do not have that luxury. We witness death close up and viscerally. The rattle of saliva in a larynx, the sheen of sweat on a cheekbone, the pulse so weak it scarcely flickers. Set against our current experience, the most pernicious story of all this January is the emerging narrative – aggressively promoted since Christmas – that the NHS has “coped” with Omicron. First, Boris Johnson insisted in a televised press conference that no new restrictions were necessary. Although hospitals were “sending out signals saying that they are feeling the pressure hugely”, he claimed, we could nevertheless “ride out” the Omicron wave with nothing more than “a difficult period for our wonderful NHS for the next few weeks”. Next, cabinet ministers waded in to insist that the prime minister had got it spot on. Michael Gove, for example, told BBC Radio 4 last week: “His judgment has been vindicated. He argued publicly that we would be able to get through this with the booster campaign.” But have we, really, got through it? More than 30 hospitals have declared critical incidents. The army has been drafted in to provide basic bedside care. Pressures on some ambulance services have been so severe that heart attack patients have been told to make their own way to hospital. Critically ill patients have died in their homes, died on the way to hospital, or died while stuck in an ambulance on a hospital forecourt, waiting 10 or 12 hours for a bed inside. Enduring conditions so manifestly unsafe for patients, multiple frontline staff have risked their jobs to go public. One emergency medicine consultant, Helen Goldrick, spoke for us all when she tweeted: “Never have I seen patients receive such suboptimal care and be at such risk. They are coming to serious harm as are [emergency department] staff who feel overwhelmed, broken, abandoned. This was predictable and preventable.” The politically convenient story of a plucky NHS being pushed to the brink, yet bravely soldiering on, is built on a false and dangerous binary. Healthcare cannot be neatly categorised into success or failure, coping or not coping. We are overwhelmed by stealth, by degree. The greater the pressures, the lower the standards of care we can provide. We need to be honest about what “riding it out” actually means. Bluntly, not everyone has. This winter, some have died from Covid who needn’t have. Some have died from NHS overcrowding, mistakes and delays who needn’t have. These are avoidable deaths, ones we could have prevented with different choices. What the prime minister announced, in effect, in his press conference was the decision to turn a blind eye to preventable dying – to knowingly sweep it under the carpet. Is it any wonder that record numbers of staff are quitting the NHS frontline? More than 27,000 people voluntarily resigned from the NHS from July to September last year, the highest number on record. Too often on the wards I see nurses or doctors breaking down in tears. I know colleagues who have seriously contemplated suicide. Burnout, depression and post-Covid PTSD are rife. We are dismissed as crying wolf, blamed for bleating incessantly about exaggerated winter crises. But only someone privileged enough not to know, or have been, an NHS patient this January could possibly pretend the NHS is coping. In his new book Dirty Work, the American author Eyal Press investigates the phenomenon of “dirty” work – labour that society considers essential, yet ethically compromised. He argues that the essential workers we prefer not to think about – guards in violent offender units, abattoir staff, drone operators inflicting aerial strikes from afar – engage in activities that sustain modern society yet are deliberately concealed from our gaze. It sounds ludicrous to suggest that these activities may have anything in common with those of highly trusted and valued professionals like doctors and nurses. But the connection is stigma, shame and moral injury. In an overwhelmed NHS, staff are conscripted, whether they like it or not, in the soul-destroying business of delivering substandard care. It feels rotten, corrosive, morally reprehensible. You are forced to see, hear, touch and smell the patients you are certain you are failing. There is no hiding behind weasel words like “coping”. Every shift is an act of survival – or not – for staff and patients alike. We can keep arguing about how much of the current NHS crisis is due to Omicron, versus the most prolonged funding squeeze in NHS history, but to do so misses the fundamental point. For years now – and long before Covid – the NHS has been quietly imploding, failing more and more patients as the months go by. It may suit the government to gloss over reality, but each of us actively chooses what stories to believe. You may have never witnessed the patients dying on trolleys, in lifts, on the floor, in their own excrement, but please – please – don’t pretend they’re not there.
