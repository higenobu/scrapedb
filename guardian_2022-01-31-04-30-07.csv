1/31/2022,"Frank Lampard has agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract to become Everton’s new manager and has immediately set about bolstering the playing resources at Goodison Park with the impending capture of Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek on a season-long loan deal from Manchester United. Lampard’s appointment as successor to Rafael Benítez, who was sacked on 16 January after a defeat by Norwich City, comes about after final interviews were held on Friday with three candidates: Lampard, Vítor Pereira and the club’s caretaker manager, Duncan Ferguson. The former Chelsea and Derby manager was offered the job after impressive Everton’s majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, in his interview. Official confirmation of Lampard’s appointment as Everton manager is expected shortly.  Lampard has been out of management since he was sacked by Chelsea just over a year ago. The 43-year-old’s immediate priority will be to steer the club to Premier League safety; they are currently 16th in the table, four points above the relegation zone. The new manager’s first match in charge will be the FA Cup fourth-round tie at home to Brentford next Saturday, with his first league game away at Newcastle on 8 February. He will expect to be able to call upon Van de Beek for those games after Everton agreed to pay the player’s full salary until the end of the season after he was identified by Lampard as a priority target, with Everton short in midfield due to injuries to Abdoulaye Doucouré, Tom Davies and Fabian Delph. The Netherlands international, who has had limited game time at United under both Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Ralf Rangnick, was also wanted by Patrick Vieira at Crystal Palace, who began their pursuit some days earlier, and he appeared ready to switch to Selhurst Park, with Palace offering to pay 85% of his salary. But Van de Beek has ultimately decided he wants to play on Merseyside rather than in south London. There is no buy option included in the deal, with Van de Beek’s agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, in London to finalise the contract. Lampard’s appointment comes at the end of a turbulent week following last Saturday’s home defeat to Aston Villa under Ferguson. Pereira emerged as the majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri’s preferred choice on Tuesday, prompting a hostile reaction from Everton fans. That led the Portuguese to take the unusual step of pitching for the job and defending his record in a live TV interview the following day. On Friday Wayne Rooney said he had turned down the offer of an interview, preferring to stay at Derby. Lampard’s backroom staff at Everton will include Joe Edwards from Chelsea and former Chelsea and Derby coach Chris Jones. A position has also been offered to Paul Clement, who assisted Carlo Ancelotti when he was manager at Stamford Bridge. Lampard also wanted Anthony Barry to join him from Chelsea but he decided to stay put.",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard agrees two-and-a-half-year deal to become Everton manager ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/everton-appoint-frank-lampard-manager
1/31/2022,"Rafael Nadal described his Australian Open triumph as his greatest comeback after he recovered from two sets down against Daniil Medvedev to win a record-breaking 21st grand slam title. Nadal defeated Medvedev, the second seed, 2-6, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 in five hours and 24 minutes, the second longest grand slam final. It is the first time in Nadal’s career he has come back from two sets down in a slam final. The Spaniard has now won two titles at all four grand slam tournaments.  “If we put everything together, the scenario, the momentum, what it means. Yeah, without a doubt probably have been the biggest comeback of my tennis career,” said Nadal. The 35-year-old was not certain to compete in Australia. He had not played for most of the previous six months due to a chronic foot injury that required surgery. Then his preparation was disrupted by Covid. Asked if this was his greatest victory, Nadal nodded. “The most unexpected, without a doubt,” he said, smiling. “And most surprising I think for everyone. For you guys, too. For me personally, especially, no? Because I know how I arrived here. I don’t know. Have been a very emotional night. Even now I am destroyed, honestly, physically. I can’t think much, I can’t remember a lot of moments of the match.” Nadal’s unexpected victory means he is now the sole owner of the men’s grand slam record but he has consistently played down the importance of the achievement. “I feel lucky to achieve one more very special thing in my tennis career,” he said. “I don’t care much if I am the one or not the one or the best of the history, not the best of the history. Honestly today I don’t care much. For me it’s about enjoying nights like today. That means everything for me. Means even more to achieve the second Australian Open more than any other thing.” Nadal received congratulations from Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic on social media. “What a match! To my friend and great rival @RafaelNadal, heartfelt congratulations on becoming the first man to win 21 grand slam singles titles,” wrote Federer. “A few months ago we were joking about both being on crutches. Amazing. Never underestimate a great champion. Your incredible work ethic, dedication and fighting spirit are an inspirational to me and countless others around the world.” Nadal explained that the hardest part about the past few months was having no timeline for a possible return. “Personally, my feeling is much easier to accept because every week you do a different thing and you see the improvements and you know that after this period of time the normal thing is you going to be fine. My position is completely different. “We were trying things. And for a long period of time without any success, with zero success. After all the things that I went through all my career, of course at my age the doubts are there. Knowing that you have an injury that you can’t recover from that, of course the doubts are there. Mentally is much tougher.” Medvedev said he was not that disappointed by the match because of Nadal’s level and the quality of his comeback. He was, however, rather affected by those spectators who booed and attempted to disrupt him throughout the match. Medvedev, who aired his frustrations during the match, started his press conference with a long monologue, explaining that when he started travelling as a youngster he dreamed of playing on the biggest stages and receiving support. He said that after the treatment from the fans, he had lost those dreams. The 25-year-old said he will only play for himself, his family and people who support him in Russia. “The kid that was dreaming is not any more in me after today,” he said. “It will be tougher to continue tennis when it’s like this.”",Sport/Sport,Rafael Nadal hails greatest comeback to win ‘unexpected’ 21st grand slam title,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/rafael-nadal-hails-greatest-comeback-to-win-unexpected-21st-grand-slam-title
1/31/2022,"“I came back to Sale to help this team achieve something near their potential, but we’re not there yet and that’s exciting,” declared Alex Sanderson after his side’s thrilling victory, and why not? Sale had done enough in the second half to show they could yet emerge as a force this season but the manner of their display justified every superlative that came their way.  Sanderson’s men, so insipid during the opening 40 minutes, trailed 18-5 at the interval to a Leicester side missing six England internationals. Yet the Sharks, inspired by a rare sell-out crowd at a raucous AJ Bell Stadium, roused themselves in quite spectacular fashion after the interval to eke out a win which could prove vital to their play-off bid. It was a performance chiselled on a collective desire and harvested four second-half tries. Ben Curry scored the first of those and taking centre stage in the absence of his twin brother Tom, who is away on England duty with Raffi Quirke and Bevan Rodd. Sanderson, who left Saracens to return to Sale as their director of rugby 12 months ago, beamed: “I gave the players the challenge at half-time and Jono Ross said: ‘It’s got to hurt, we need that desire to have a greater intensity to dictate the game.’ “Jono put that to the team and they went out and did it. He’s a good captain and this is a great team. I’m proud to be a part of it.” Leicester, who fielded a youthful lineup, scored the game’s opening try in the 14th minute when Julián Montoya barrelled over the line following a lineout drive. It was his fifth Premiership try of the season and Freddie Burns’ conversion made it 10-0. Sale’s reply was almost instant as the full-back Luke James backed himself to beat a Tigers defender and scarpered over the line inside the right channel. Yet Steve Borthwick’s side came back strongly and the winger Guy Porter capitalised on some weak tackling to evade two Sale defenders and dive over in the left corner. With Burns booting two penalties and a conversion, the Premiership leaders were 18-5 up at the interval but in no way in control. Ben Curry, deputising stylishly for his brother, crashed over the line from a lineout drive and AJ MacGinty converted. Sanderson said of the flanker: “Ben just does everything at 100 miles per hour doesn’t he? He’s like a finely-coiled spring and has been exceptional for us, so I’ve had some really difficult selection decisions I’ve had to make. “His brother is one of the best players in the world but Ben’s not far off, let’s face it. Then we’ve got Jono Ross as a captain and Jean-Luc and Dan du Preez as well. But when Ben plays like you’ve got to start him.” Life surged through the Sharks after Curry’s try and Arron Reed again showcased how lightning quick he is by scampering clear in the left corner for a third home score. Montoya’s second try from a maul restored Leicester’s lead but Sale continued to pour forward and they were not to be denied. MacGinty kicked a penalty to put them back in front and, after Dan du Preez touched down, the homegrown winger Tom Roebuck then confirmed victory when he galloped clear to score with four minutes remaining and amid scenes of mounting euphoria. The match, televised live by ITV, was rapturously received by the crowd and Sanderson said the England centre Manu Tuilagi and South Africa’s scrum-half Faf de Klerk could return from injury in Sunday’s trip to Harlequins. Borthwick, Sanderson’s opposite number, cut a frustrated figure but refused to blame the absence of his England men for the defeat. Borthwick said: “I’m not going to spend any time on people who aren’t here. I thought the effort was magnificent. We had a lot of young players out there and the scoreline wasn’t what we wanted it to be, but we’ll learn from it and be a better team going forward.”",Sport/Sport,Sanderson hails Sale’s intensity after comeback victory over Leicester,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/sale-leicester-premiership-match-report-rugby-union
1/31/2022,"Hospitals in England could continue to employ unvaccinated NHS healthcare workers beyond the April deadline if not doing so risks leaving them dangerously understaffed, the sector regulator has indicated. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it would implement the government diktat for mandatory jabs “fairly and proportionately”, amid fears that it will exacerbate the NHS’s existing staff crisis.  Its comments were welcomed by hospital trusts, comingbefore Thursday’s deadline for all NHS staff in England who have direct contact with patients to have their first dose of a Covid vaccine, in order to complete the course before 1 April, or risk losing their job. About 80,000 frontline NHS workers have still not had a first dose and the NHS already has 93,000 vacancies, including 40,000 for nurses. Ted Baker, CQC’s chief inspector of hospitals, said: “We will work with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to ensure that this government legislation is implemented fairly and proportionately when it comes into effect. “New regulations requiring registered healthcare providers to only deploy fully vaccinated staff in patient-facing roles do not supersede other regulatory requirements and hospital trusts may need to make difficult risk-based decisions in order to determine the safest possible approach in different circumstances.” In comments to the Sunday Times, expanding on the CQC’s approach, Baker said: “We fully recognise there are concerns that the introduction of mandatory vaccination rules risks exacerbating existing staff shortages.” Unions, including the Royal College of Nursing and the TUC, have called for mandatory jabs to be delayed, or even scrapped, voicing fears about the impact it will have on staffing levels. The government’s own impact assessment of its policy concluded that as many as 73,000 staff may leave rather than get jabbed, with women, people from ethnic minorities and younger workers among those most likely to quit or be forced out. There have also been demands by Tory backbenchers for the policy to be dropped. There was a mixed reaction to the CQC’s comments. NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, welcomed them as reflecting its own concerns. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “NHS Providers has consistently flagged that there were always two risks to manage here – the risk of Covid cross-infection in healthcare settings and the consequences of losing staff if significant numbers refused to be vaccinated. The CQC is clearly also seeking to act proportionately in balancing these risks as it carries out its role. “Trusts are working hard to increase the number of vaccinated staff and the numbers are rising with growing speed as we approach the deadline for the first vaccination to be completed. “But we know there may be some services at risk if trusts need to redeploy or dismiss all unvaccinated staff when the April deadline is reached, as the current government regulations would require them to do. We still don’t know how serious or widespread this risk will be, but it is one that NHS leaders will clearly need to manage.” But the UK’s largest health union, Unison, warned that the CQC’s comments only muddied the waters and suggested that the policy was unworkable. Sara Gorton, Unison’s head of health, said: “This suggests a confusing element of discretion will now apply over what’s already distracting and unnecessary legislation. Allowing the rules to be set aside in certain cases creates a risk of unfair and potentially discriminatory treatment. If the CQC thinks the mandatory approach is incompatible with safe staffing, then the new law should simply be scrapped.” A DHSC spokesperson said: “Health and social care workers look after the most vulnerable people in society and ensuring staff are vaccinated is the right thing to do to protect patients and those in care. We continue to work closely with trusts to encourage uptake of the vaccine – the vast majority of NHS staff have had the vaccine which is our best defence against Covid-19. As we have done throughout the pandemic, we keep all Covid-19 policies under review.”",News/Society,"NHS England could employ unvaccinated staff after 1 April, says regulator",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/30/nhs-england-could-employ-unvaccinated-staff-after-1-april-says-regulator
1/31/2022,"The court system of England and Wales was already in crisis before the pandemic – a direct effect of government cuts leading to closures and staff shortages. Between 2010 and 2020, the Ministry of Justice’s budget was cut by 40%. Annual spending on legal aid fell by almost £1bn over a period of five years. Then Covid hit, gumming up the system further and leading to widespread cancellations and delays. The consequence is an enormous backlog that has been largely overlooked, in part because most people do not regularly interact with the justice system. Currently there are 372,000 cases waiting to be heard in magistrates courts and almost 60,000 in crown courts, where more serious offences are tried. We don’t tend to describe court delays as a “waiting list”, but a long queue for justice is what these numbers add up to. This affects victims and witnesses as well as defendants. All must wait, sometimes for years, for the outcome of events that may well have changed their lives. For those held on remand and subsequently found not guilty, there is no recompense for time wasted. Cumulatively, and over time, the risk is a wider loss of public confidence in the legal system. Among victims’ groups, one fear is that offenders may be emboldened. The number of reported rapes reached a new record of 63,136 in the year to September 2021.  At least the government has realised that this situation is untenable. Ministers are considering the recommendations of an independent review of legal aid, including an immediate £135m-a-year funding increase, and the creation of a new oversight board. But the announcement of a new recruitment campaign for 4,000 volunteer magistrates provides cause for concern as well as reassurance. This is because the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is not seeking simply to build up numbers again – there were 12,651 magistrates last year compared with 25,170 in 2012. Instead his department, supported by the Magistrates Association, is giving them the power to send people to prison for up to a year (the current maximum for a single offence is six months). The plan is that this will free up 1,700 crown court sitting days. Magistrates, who are lay people with no legal qualifications, play an important role in our legal system. There are good reasons for justice to be administered locally, by people who belong to the community in which crimes have been committed. The closure of around half of all magistrates courts between 2010 and 2019 was shortsighted, and efforts to recruit from a more diverse pool are welcome (and supported by the payment of expenses, including for loss of earnings). But there are also reasons why magistrates’ authority, particularly to send people to prison for long stretches, is limited. Sitting for as few as 13 days a year on a voluntary basis, they lack the overview and expertise of judges. England and Wales already have the highest per capita prison population in western Europe, and an atrocious record on rehabilitation. Improving the performance of the probation service, and developing the use of community sentences, would be more likely to benefit the public than these changes. Other concerns include the effect that the new sentencing powers will have on defendants’ decision-making. If longer sentences handed down by magistrates result in more appeals, then reduced waiting lists will not be achieved. Mr Raab, who is the sixth Conservative justice secretary in just seven years, is right about one thing: the backlog in the courts is a disaster. But a system-wide crisis created by chronic underfunding will not, with the best will in the world, be resolved by volunteers. This is no way to deliver justice.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on waiting for justice: Raab seeks a shortcut | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/the-guardian-view-on-waiting-for-justice-raab-seeks-a-shortcut
