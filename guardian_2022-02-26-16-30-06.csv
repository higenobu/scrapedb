2/26/2022,"“Ihave no love for America, as such; I have no patriotism. I have no country. What country have I? The institutions of this country do not know me – do not recognise me as a man. I am not thought of or spoken of except as a piece of property. Now, in such a country as this I cannot have patriotism.” The words are spoken by The Harder They Fall actor Jonathan Majors, wearing a hoodie before a bare brick wall, at the opening of Frederick Douglass: In Five Speeches, an HBO documentary that makes a case that the fugitive slave turned celebrity abolitionist was also one of America’s great prose poets. Sadly for the film-makers, no recordings of Douglass exist. But here a starry cast – Nicole Beharie, Colman Domingo, Majors, Denzel Whitaker and Jeffrey Wright – conjure his spirit by performing excerpts from five speeches, each representing a different moment in 19th-century America as well as his own political evolution. The vignettes give ample reminder that, despite never having a day of formal education, Douglass wrote like an angel and entranced audiences like Cicero. They might also give cause to mourn a golden age of oratory that few political figures seek to match these days. But Douglass was also one of the most photographed men of the 19th century. His understanding of the power of the pen, the voice and the image was ahead of his time. And he was not without ego. Julia Marchesi, the film’s director, says: “He was an early social media master. That photography thing is completely channelling the power of social media so I have no doubt that he would be all over it [now].” The film is inspired by Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom, a Pulitzer prize-winning biography by David Blight, who is among its talking heads. But adapting this monumental 764-page book about Douglass’s multi-faceted life would have required countless hours of screen time. So Marchesi chose a more impressionistic structure. “I really wanted to make people understand why he mattered and why he matters,” the 42-year-old says via Zoom from Brooklyn. “I think a lot of Americans have a sense of who he is just from his face on public murals or his name on street signs but I felt that people didn’t really appreciate why he became so famous, and that’s because of his words. “That was the inspiration to then figure out how to showcase his writing and his speeches in a new way and that’s how we devised the five acts with actors performing speeches. You do see an interesting evolution in his demeanour, in the words but also the actors portray that as well. “You have Denzel Whitaker, very young, very nervous, but also fiery. Jonathan Majors even more fiery and angry. But then by the time you get to Colman Domingo and Jeffrey Wright, he’s mellowed out a bit because he’s the statesman and now has a higher responsibility for being the spokesman of his people. I found the actors naturally portrayed that evolution in the way they delivered the speeches, which was great.” The film tells how Douglass was born in 1818, escaped from slavery in 1838 and became a prominent abolitionist, offering audiences a unique story rooted in authentic experience. But white abolitionists found the Shakespeare-loving Douglass too polished, telling him to “put more plantation” in his voice so that he would not “sound as white”. His riposte was to publish an autobiography that was not only an invaluable historical document. Executive producer Henry Louis Gates Jr says in the film: “It is an act of language. Douglass creates a work of art.” As a fugitive slave, Douglass’s literary fame threatened his freedom, so he fled to Britain and Ireland, where he delivered more than a hundred lectures about the fight against slavery. It was there, he said, that he felt he was treated with dignity and respect rather than as a property for the first time. Marchesi says: “It’s hard for us to understand because he talks about it as if racism doesn’t exist in England, which of course we know that it does, but I think that he was responding to it in contrast to what was going on in America at that time. “He felt that the Brits approached him and treated him like a man’ they did not treat him like he was an enslaved man. As he says in the speech [performed by Majors], he came back with this contrast in his mind and it made him even more angry with his country. It gave him this new perspective.” The Douglass who returned to America was more militant and fuelled by rage. Majors, 31, delivers an impassioned rendition of the “Country, Conscience and the Anti-Slavery Cause” speech that Douglass gave when he was 30. Majors, with hoodie pulled over his head, then says in an interview in the film: “When he says that it’s crushing them to the earth, that’s when I went, ‘OK, that’s brother Floyd,’” – referring to George Floyd, an African American man murdered by police in Minneapolis in 2020. “That is that image and it’s not a new thing. It just made me want to say those words to people for the people who couldn’t.” Douglass channeled his energy into a newspaper that effectively declared his independence from the abolitionist William Garrison. He gave perhaps his best known speech, “What to the slave is the Fourth of July?”, described by Gates as “the oratorical masterpiece of the abolitionist movement” and likened by Blight to a symphony with three movements. Douglass was also a staunch supporter of women’s suffrage – he was the only male speaker at the Seneca Falls convention of 1848 – but had “difficult” relationships in his private life. The film explores his 44-year marriage to Anna Murray Douglass, whom he ignored in his writing, dooming her to be another of history’s hidden figures. Marchesi says: “This was an enduring partnership; she got him through. They met before he escaped so this was a woman who’d been there for everything and that kind of bond never breaks. His life got very complicated but she was always there. “A lot of people argue that she was the reason he could do what he did and that has not been celebrated in the history books. This woman was at his home, taking care of his kids, pressing his clothes and entertaining people. “Who knows whether he would have been able to have the influence he did if he didn’t have a woman like that? That’s something that people never used to talk about with Douglass and David has opened that up a little bit with his book.” Whether he remained faithful is “much disputed” (after Anna’s death, he caused a scandal by marrying a white woman). His letters suggest he was a good if often absent father. In his biography, Blight calls him “‘beautifully human” and in the film, Gates says: “Douglass had his flaws, he had his weaknesses. I think the most human we make our heroes, the more noble they became.” Marchesi adds: “We need to understand the full man. When you hold someone on a pedestal, I don’t think it does anyone any favours. You need to know that they have weaknesses because I think it makes people want to listen to them more. It’s like, oh, actually there’s three dimensions to this person and he was a brilliant orator but he had a messy personal life and so do I. There’s an element of hero worship that isn’t actually helpful.” It was a sentiment shared by South Africa’s anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, who said he did not want all the statues and hagiography and deification. But Marchesi replies: “I don’t think Douglass would have said that. This is a man who had over 150 pictures of himself taken, so he liked the celebrity aspect. People digging into his personal life was not what he wanted, for sure.” The American civil war began when Douglass was 43. He was too old to fight but not to deliver another stemwinder or two. He saw the north’s fight against over the slave-owning south as the culmination of all his striving: the death knell for slavery. Douglass met President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. The Union’s victory and emancipation later should have brought a sense of vindication and victory. But he observed: “Though slavery was abolished, the wrongs of my people were not ended. Though they were not slaves, they were not yet quite free. I therefore soon found that the negro had still a cause and that he needed my voice and my pen to plead for it.” White supremacy was just asleep, Gates explains, and not for long. The horrors of Reconstruction brought a backlash of mob violence from former slaveholders and their allies and a realisation that Douglass’s work would never be done. He wrote his final speech in 1893 and took it on the road despite chest pains, trembling hands and deep weariness. Gates observes in the documentary: “He’s always drawn back into combat. The war’s never over because white supremacy is the beast that won’t be defeated.” Marchesi, previously producer and director of the series Reconstruction: America after The Civil War, observes: “We’re only truly appreciating now that the end of slavery wasn’t the end. That’s why Douglass’s life is just this constant three steps forward, two steps back. It’s constant heartbreak and just as he thinks they’re there, this epidemic of lynchings starts sweeping the country. “He has to get out there again and it’s exhausting because he thinks we won this battle and I’m not sure he saw that coming. There was a lot of hope right after the war. There were all these Black men elected to Congress and I think his feeling was that Reconstruction was going to work and no one could have foreseen that backlash and how harsh it really was. I don’t think Douglass did. “He gave some speeches about it: I thought we settled this question with the war; why are we still doing this? He’d be saying the same thing today, maybe to a lesser degree – lynchings aren’t sweeping the nation – but we still are dealing with the aftermath of the civil war for sure.” Douglass died in 1895 at the age of 77. Since then, through the deathless prose, he has been a constant voice urging America to do better, to live up to its ideals. In 2017 a confused President Donald Trump used the present tense in remarking: “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.” Marchesi reflects: “It’s easy to name a street after him or put up a mural and say he is important but the purpose of this film is here’s why this person matters. Listen to what he said. Listen to how he wrote it. Listen to the skill that he had to persuade people, How can we harness that now? “Speech making is not really a skill that we talk about much anymore. There’s Obama and JFK but nobody really talks about speech making a something that’s a particularly prized skill. But the power of persuasion and how we talk to each other and how we communicate activist messaging - he was a master and so he should be studied for that reason.” Douglass’s first autobiography is taught in schools, Marchesi notes, and she would like to see his speeches more widely read. “Even more than this icon of the abolitionist movement, he’s an extraordinary person, an extraordinary American on par with Lincoln. He needs to be celebrated. “Yes, he was influential and he was an activist and agitator but he was also an artist. He wrote literature and he used words to move people. Because his voice was never recorded, we don’t have a sense of how powerful those words really were.” Frederick Douglass: In Five Speeches is now available on HBO Max with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘Listen to what he said’: remembering and honoring the speeches of Frederick Douglass,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/26/frederick-douglass-hbo-documentary
2/26/2022,"Unseen photographs and paintings of JRR Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings fantasy books, have been released by the writer’s estate, along with draft manuscripts and letters. Its website has been relaunched with new material, including sections on Tolkien’s calligraphy and a timeline of his life. Audio recordings and video clips featuring both Tolkien, who died in 1973, and his son Christopher, who died in 2020, are among the new material. The relaunch date of 26 February is significant in Tolkien lore because 26 February 3019 was the date in the Third Age when the Fellowship of the Ring was broken at Amon Hen and Frodo and Sam set out on their lonely and terrifying journey to Mordor. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was a distinguished academic at Oxford University who in his spare time wrote stories and poetry, painted, and invented languages and alphabets. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, his most famous works, were set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is one of the bestselling books of all time, with more than 100 million copies sold, and has been translated into dozens of languages. It was also adapted into an acclaimed and extremely lucrative film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. A new Lord of the Rings series, made by Amazon at an estimated cost of more than $1bn and to be launched in September, has caused accusations of “wokery” by casting actors of colour as elves and dwarves. Christopher Tolkien drew many of the original maps detailing the world of Middle-earth for his father’s The Lord of the Rings when the series was first published between 1954 and 1955. Two decades after JRR Tolkien’s death, he published The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Beren And Lúthien and The History of Middle-earth, which fleshed out the complex world of elves and dwarves created by his father.",Arts/Books,"Unseen JRR Tolkien paintings, photographs and video clips released",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/26/unseen-jrr-tolkien-paintings-photographs-and-video-clips-released

2/26/2022,"The government’s two most senior advisers in the pandemic will turn their attention to health inequalities, the state of the UK’s air and emerging technologies following the milestone decision to end all legal Covid restrictions in England this week. While the pandemic is far from over, Boris Johnson’s announcement on Monday of the “living with Covid” plan is expected to be the last time Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, and Sir Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, will flank the prime minister to explain the UK’s response. As the country moves beyond the emergency phase of the crisis, Vallance and Whitty are expected to slip out of the spotlight and make headway with other projects. “We are not witnessing the end of Covid, but we are probably witnessing the end of the Chris and Patrick show,” said Prof Jack Stilgoe, a specialist on the governance of emerging technologies at University College London. “It is easy to forget how strange it is to have senior scientists showing powerpoint slides on the nightly news.” Not that the Covid work is going away. Vallance and Whitty will continue to follow the data on infections, hospitalisations and deaths, the effectiveness of vaccines, and whether further doses or different shots are needed. With the end of free tests for the general public, the GP-led surveillance system for “influenza-like illness” is being adapted to detect new variants of Covid. Prof David Heymann, the former chair of the Health Protection Agency, said Whitty and Vallance will probably focus on three key areas. First, strong public health capabilities are needed to identify, investigate and close down future outbreaks – with precision lockdowns if needed. Second, the NHS needs beefing up to withstand a surge in admissions alongside routine patient loads in the event of a future pandemic. Third, more must be done to make the population more resilient, through promotion of healthier lifestyles and perhaps tobacco-like taxes on unhealthy products, Heymann said. Whitty already has work under way on health inequalities, tragically exposed in the pandemic, and will look in particular at problems in coastal towns. A report on air quality is also in the pipeline – an issue that overlaps with health inequality and the underlying issues of deprivation, housing, lifestyle and employment. As the chief scientific adviser, Vallance has a wider role and in recent months has taken on the title of national technology adviser and set up two new government bodies, the National Science and Technology Council and the Office for Science and Technology Strategy. The aim is to help ministers understand, and know how to exploit, emerging science and technology to help achieve net zero emissions, improve public health and strengthen national security. As Prof James Wilsdon, an expert in research policy at the University of Sheffield, points out, “it will take time and effort to make them work effectively”. With a public inquiry into the Covid response looming, Wilsdon believes Vallance will want to lead a “root and branch review” of the UK’s science advisory system and the lessons to be drawn, good and bad. According to Stilgoe, that inquiry will want to apportion blame and with politicians normally better at playing the blame game than scientists, he warned: “Science will need defending from politicians who will claim they were just doing what the scientists told them.” Several experts believe Whitty is well placed to help the NHS clear its backlogs and recover from the carnage of the pandemic, but it is unclear how much influence he will have on this. “The biggest challenge for Chris will be to have a role in the priorities for clearing health backlogs,” said Prof David Salisbury, former head of immunisations at the Home Office. “Although superficially the work of NHS England, the prioritisation of tasks and capacity to respond become public health issues as well as just capacity topics.” England’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Sir Jonathan Van-Tam, will stand down at the end of March, but it is unclear how long Vallance and Whitty will remain in their posts. Wilson speculates that Vallance could take over from Sir Jeremy Farrar as director of the Wellcome Trust next year, or become president of the Royal Society in 2025. “Whitty is harder to predict,” he said, and may continue as CMO for “some years to come”, or step back into a chief scientific adviser role in a government department. While Vallance and Whitty will welcome stepping out of the spotlight, Heymann believes neither should disappear from public view. “It would be good for them to appear periodically to remind people what needs to be done, both to prepare for the next pandemic should it occur and also what needs to be done with other problems,” he said. “They’ve got the trust of the population and they should use that.”",News/Society,Vallance and Whitty to step out of spotlight as Covid restrictions end in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/vallance-and-whitty-to-step-out-of-spotlight-as-covid-restrictions-end-in-england

2/26/2022,"Consumers may have been shocked to have received details of the new gas and electricity prices they will start paying on 1 April, including daily standing charges as high as 51p a day. Last month the energy regulator, Ofgem, revealed the new caps on prices and warned that the average household will be paying just under £2,000 a year to heat and light their home – a 54% increase. While that figure may have seemed rather abstract, householders have received a jolt of reality as the actual unit prices have been published. Although providers can charge less than the cap, those who have been in touch with customers so far are moving prices up to the limit, which means £700-a-year-plus increases are on the cards for millions. That could just be the start. Wholesale gas prices rose 28% on Thursday’s news that Russian forces had invaded Ukraine. If those are sustained, Ofgem will have to substantially increase prices again when they it reviews the cap for the autumn. That raises the prospect of gas and electricity bills of more than £2,500 a year. British Gas has told customers on its capped tariffs that from 1 April they will pay 28p-30p per kWh for electricity. There will be a 45p-51p daily standing charge for electricity, and 27p-37p for gas. Those who pay by direct debit will pay the least. Customers paying by cash or cheque on receipt of their bill, or because who have a prepayment meter, will be charged more. These are average prices, and will vary very slightly according to where you live. Shell Energy wrote to its customers this week outlining very similar rates, and earlier this month EDF announced its prices would also go up in line with Ofgem’s cap. Only those on long-term fixed tariffs signed with a supplier that has not failed will avoid the rises. Ofgem allows suppliers to set their prices as long as the overall price comes in below or at the cap – the maximum they can charge. From 1 April a British Gas dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit will pay £262 a year in standing charges alone, or £318 if they have a prepayment meter. And that is before they have consumed a single unit. The cost of those units is also rising alarmingly. In the east of England, Shell Energy is raising the price of 1kWh of electricity from 20.871p to 29.239p. At the same time, its gas rates will change from 4.055p to 7.344p per kWh – about double those charged on average as little as a year ago.",Lifestyle/Money,Energy bills: Britons in shock as suppliers confirm price rise,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/26/energy-bills-suppliers-price-rise-gas-electricity
2/26/2022,"Funmi Alder, the headteacher of Bearwood primary school in Berkshire, is waiting with bated breath to see if her students return from their half-term break next week devastated and convinced that world war three is about to break out in the UK. Alder has got her teachers on the lookout but it is the year 5s and 6s she is most anxious about. “They studied world war two in the autumn term,” she said. The comparisons, she fears, could be too much for some. “Their class teachers can discuss the current events as a class, and some children can share any anxiety then.” Over at the offices of The Week Junior, editor-in-chief Anna Bassi is struggling to decide how to explain the invasion to its readers, aged eight to 14, in next week’s issue. “We will need to tell our readers clearly and as calmly as we possibly can exactly what is happening and what has led to this situation,” she said. One of the things Bassi places great emphasis on is providing context. “Without that, it could feel to a child as though these things just come out of nowhere and that could be terrifying for them,” she said. But Bassi is also concerned that children could be getting information from unreliable, unfiltered social media outlets. “We will definitely advise them where the reputable places are to seek information from and tell them that if they’re anxious, to talk to adults and not dig further into possibly anxiety-inducing news sources that will exacerbate their fears.” Prof Vivian Hill, the director of University College London Institute of Education’s educational, child and adolescent psychology training programme, said parents had very little control any more about how their children accessed knowledge about the outside world. “In a modern society, it’s so difficult to shield children from anything,” she said. “Today’s children are more aware of the conflict in Ukraine than any previous generation’s children would have been because of 24-hour rolling news and social media. “Even if parents try to shield their children at home, they’ll see it on their smartphones or hear about it in playground from other kids,” she said. “But whatever children are hearing outside the home, parents need to make sure they’re also getting accurate information and that it’s in context. “There is, however, a delicate balance between informing children, and feeding into their anxieties by talking about it too much.” Judith Wenban-Smith, a forensic psychologist with a special interest in families, said parents should keep a close eye on their children’s anxiety levels as the invasion continued. “Every bomb will generate yet more headlines, and politicians will respond with ever more aggressive talk,” she said. “The problem is that in the past two years, children have learned that the world is a dangerous place and that bad things can and do happen close to home because of Covid.” Mike Hughesman, a former principal educational psychologist for Service Children’s Education, said: “Facebook flashed something up at me just today about the risk of a nuclear attack in the UK. “Parents need to tell anxious children that the world has been in situations like this before and they’ve been resolved. They also need to emphasise, perhaps with the use of a map, how far away this conflict is to them.” Hughesman divides children into two groups. Those younger than seven, who are still in the “monsters in the cupboard” phase, need to be soothed then distracted with the continuation of everyday routines. Older children, however, need reassurance through information and context. “Talk to them about the Bay of Pigs and other conflicts. Tell them that people had the same fears and anxieties then but those crisies blew over,” he said. Dr Jeremy Swinson, an educational psychologist who has worked with the government, recommended that concerned parents try a cognitive behavioural therapy approach to help anxious children. “The first stage is cognition: discuss exactly why they’re anxious and give them the specific information they need to put those anxieties into perspective,” he said. The second stage is behavioural. “Teenagers love a campaign,” he said. “Help them to displace their worries by getting involved with a local charity that’s working to help those in Ukraine.”",News/Society,‘A delicate balance’: experts’ tips on dealing with Ukraine anxiety in children,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/ukraine-anxiety-children-psychologists-teachers
2/26/2022,"As Russian troops encircled Ukraine, politicians and media pundits in the US were largely united in their condemnation of Vladimir Putin’s imminent attack. Tucker Carlson, however, took a different approach. Hours before Putin ordered his forces into Ukraine, Fox News’ biggest star was still praising the Russian president. Putin’s bellicose threats towards Ukraine and assembling of up to 190,000 troops on the country’s border, was, Carlson said, a mere “border dispute”. Carlson, who played into Kremlin talking points by declaring that Ukraine was “not a democracy”, launched an apparent attempt to humanize Putin. “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia?” Carlson said as he then recited a right-wing tip sheet of pet causes. “Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity?” Just over 24 hours later, Putin effectively declared war on Ukraine. Carlson was roundly condemned, but he wasn’t alone. Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s sometime-advisor turned podcast host, has praised Putin for being “anti-woke”, for not flying pride flags, and for his hostility to trans people. Charlie Kirk, a right-wing media personality and the founder of Turning Points USA, suggested Putin felt emboldened by “energy policies that Joe Biden put forward”. “Could it be that Greta Thunberg and Leonardo DiCaprio actually might be to blame for what Vladimir Putin is doing?” Kirk asked on his eponymous internet show. “That’s a take you will not hear anywhere else,” he added. By the end of the week Carlson’s colorful defense of Putin was being played on Russia 1 and the Kremlin-backed RT television network. “As Russia prepared to invade Ukraine, the biggest star on Fox News was busy doing what he does best: being thoroughly and appallingly wrong,” Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist for the Washington Post, wrote. By Thursday night, after Putin’s forces had begun bombing Ukraine, and after widespread US and global outrage at the carnage, Carlson had changed his tune. “I don’t think anybody approves of what Putin did yesterday. I certainly don’t,” he said on his show. Carlson added: “Vladimir Putin started this war.” He continued: “He is to blame tonight for what we’re seeing tonight in the Ukraine.” But those expecting a mea culpa from Carlson, who has recently also become enamored with the authoritarian regime of Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, were disappointed. The overt praise for Putin may have receded, but Carlson and his Fox News co-hosts and pundits have continued to blame others for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Well, I think we all know if Donald Trump was president, this would not have happened,” Lara Trump, Fox News contributor and daughter-in-law of the former president, told Fox and Friends on Thursday. “We exuded strength on the world stage when Donald Trump was there. Now you see Joe Biden in office. And gosh, how many times have we all talked about how weak America has looked since the day that Joe Biden was inaugurated?” Fox News Twitter feed on Friday essentially served as a tribute to the same viewpoint, lavishly quoting almost identical statements from Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn. “Rather than blame the actual aggressor for attacking his weaker neighbor, right-wing media pinned the blame on Biden for supposedly projecting weakness and vulnerability to Putin,” Media Matters, a non-profit which monitors conservative media, wrote. “In the right-wing media echo chamber [...] the fault for this invasion lies with a mind-boggling variety of scapegoats, including President Joe Biden, Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, American environmentalists, the LGBTQ community, and even the team here at Media Matters for America - anybody, that is, other than Putin.” The narrative has received some pushback from journalists at Fox News itself, particularly Jennifer Griffin, the network’s national security correspondent, who has spent weeks painstakingly correcting her opinion-host colleagues as Russia surrounded Ukraine. On Thursday morning, the anchors on the morning show Fox and Friends were opining about how sanctions against Russia “have not worked”. Steve Doocy asked Griffin if “the people at the Pentagon” were frustrated given American troops were not involved. “No I wouldn’t say that Steve. In fact they know that they had limited options going into this because Russia of course is a nuclear power, and Nato and the US are not go to war with Russia over Ukraine, their goal is to contain this and keep this from spilling over into an Article 5 nation,” Griffin said. “You talk about how the sanctions haven’t worked, I don’t know that we can say that yet. Overnight, the stock market in Russia fell by half, 50%. “This is just the beginning of what is being described as a ‘shock and awe,’ if you will, of rolling sanctions that have not even begun to be felt yet by Putin, by his oligarchs, by the cronies there.” The talk and tone among the hosts of Fox News and others in the right-wing media ecosystem is unlikely to change any time soon. But in some corners there are journalists willing to drag those hosts back to reality.",News/Media,Tucker Carlson leads rightwing charge to blame everyone but Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/25/tucker-carlson-fox-news-russia-putin
2/26/2022,"Amanda Seyfried has gone all-in to play the part of fallen Silicon Valley CEO Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout (Disney+, from Thursday), opting for the kind of immersive performance that is as hungry for awards as Nicole Kidman’s prosthetic nose. By all accounts, the real Holmes was a shapeshifter, adjusting her voice and her look as her star rose, and Seyfried embraces every bit of that transformation, from the scruffy 19-year-old in business-suit cosplay to the full face of slap and infamous black polo neck. Just as Dopesick dated its action by its characters’ hairstyles, this does it with eyeliner. The thicker it is, the closer we are to the moment Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker. Holmes was once the youngest female, self-made billionaire in the US. She was on magazine covers, touted as the next Steve Jobs, whom she idolised, and her company, Theranos, promised to transform medicine by allowing blood tests for a plethora of ailments to be carried out with a single drop of blood. But the concept ran away from the science, and the science never caught up. Screeners for the show came with a request that reviewers do not give away any plot details, but I think it’s safe to say that Holmes – who was found guilty of fraud and deceiving investors just weeks ago – found notoriety, if not the sort she was searching for. The Dropout begins with the Holmes who will be familiar to fans of the podcast on which this series is based – deep-voiced and carefully answering questions during a taped legal deposition. Aside from a quick flashback to a running race in 1995, in which Holmes is so slow her teacher tells her to give up – it would be a heavy-handed metaphor, were it not true – Seyfried takes Holmes from her last days at school, through what was a revealingly traumatic time at university, to her years in San Francisco, raising billions of dollars of investment for a tech product that did not work. Her metamorphosis from ambitious wannabe to Steve Jobs tribute act is played for tragedy and/or laughs, though not by Seyfried – who keeps it doggedly straight throughout – but in the circus that swirls around her. Brief forays into the outrageous world of obscene tech wealth hint at a Wolf of Wall Street energy that never materialises. Holmes’s mother Noel (Elizabeth Marvel) and the family’s wealthy, dastardly capitalist neighbour Richard (William H Macy) are ripped from a Christopher Guest movie, while Holmes’s boyfriend and business partner Sunny Balwani (Lost’s Naveen Andrews) is all bluster and menace. Holmes sits wide-eyed and wild-eyed, surprisingly passive, unconvincingly in the middle. One of the show’s many issues is that it can’t decide whether it thinks Holmes’s predicament is trivial or not. In a way, this is understandable. The real Holmes is intriguing because, even now, it seems impossible to know what was going on in her mind. For the first two episodes, it grasps at elements of her personality and attempts to build a portrait out of them, but it can’t settle on what it wants her to be. Is she a klutz who can’t keep her bra strap up? Is she socially inept, unable to make friends, and so blunt with her own mother that she coolly informs her she is considering becoming sexually active for the first time? Is she a victim of bro-culture sexism? Or is she a visionary who wanted to do good in the world, whose precociousness catapulted her into a cutthroat business environment that required her to eat or be eaten? The story’s appeal, of course, is that she may have been all of these things, or some, or none. There is an opportunity to cleverly balance the possibilities, but instead it swings for the easiest of balls: a mother who can’t say “I love you”, a moment spelling out that Mark Zuckerberg is allowed to dress scruffily when Holmes is not, because he’s a man. Much like Pam & Tommy, another rollercoaster re-enactment of a true story that is stuffed with stars but lacking in sense, this suffers from tonal insecurity. I suspect this comes from being based on true events, with a framework largely pre-written. It threatens to be camp, then backs away as if ashamed. It threatens to be thrilling, but never dares to go far enough. By episode three, at long last, it finds some consistency, as the screws tighten on the business Holmes has carefully constructed. It is far more comfortable as a nailbiter than it is as a farce. As soon as that thick eyeliner has been applied, the voice has deepened and the polo neck is on, there are hints that The Dropout may yet prove to be worth it.",Arts/Television & radio,The Dropout: this true-crime story aims for Wolf of Wall Street energy – and misses,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/26/the-dropout-this-true-crime-story-aims-for-wolf-of-wall-street-energy-and-misses

2/26/2022,"Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, and Sir Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, became household names after they were propelled into the spotlight by the Covid pandemic. For the past two years, they have flanked Boris Johnson at Downing Street briefings armed with PowerPoint slides and exponential curves. But with the announcement this week of England’s plan for “living with Covid” the advisers are expected to take a step back. Here are some of their most memorable moments. Early in the coronavirus pandemic, Sir Patrick Vallance suggested that building herd immunity in the UK through widespread transmission could be the UK’s strategy for handling the pandemic. On 13 March 2020, Sir Patrick Vallance, speaking to the BBC’s Today show, said the key things the UK needed to do was to fight the pandemic was to “build up some degree of herd immunity”, saying that because the vast majority of people with coronavirus get a mild illness, herd immunity would mean that more people are immune to the virus and transmission would be reduced. The concept of building herd immunity through exposure prompted backlash and was criticised by figures such as former health secretary Jeremy Hunt. Speaking to the health select committee on the 17 March 2020, Sir Patrick Vallance stated that if the number of coronavirus deaths reached 20,000 or below, that would be a “good outcome”, although it would still be “horrible” and “an enormous number of deaths”. Of course, the UK’s total coronavirus death toll greatly surpassed this prediction. As of 25 February 2022, there were a total of 161,104 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test. Amid the controversy over Dominic Cummings’s journey to Durham during lockdown, Whitty and Vallance were asked whether they were “entirely comfortable with the prime minister telling you you can’t answer questions about Dominic Cummings”. In response, Chris Whitty said: “I can assure you, the desire not to get pulled into politics is far stronger on the part of Sir Patrick [Vallance] and me than it is on the prime minister”. Vallance added: “I’m a civil servant, I’m politically neutral and I don’t want to get involved in politics at all”. On 10 June 2020, When looking at specific ways the UK could have improved their response to the coronavirus pandemic when it first emerged, Whitty said that if he had to choose one issue, it would be “looking at how we could speed up testing early on in the epidemic”. “There are many good reasons why it was tricky, but if I was to play things again, and this is largely based on what some other countries were able to do, in particular Germany, I think that’s the one thing we would have put more emphasis on at an earlier stage”. In April 2020, the UK’s daily coronavirus testing rate had only just passed 10,000. In June 2021, a video was widely shared on social media of a man putting Whitty in a headlock when he declined to be in a photograph with him. Whitty later said that he did not “think anything of it” and was “surprised that the media picked up on it”. “I’m sure he will become a model citizen in due course,” he added. Both Lewis Hughes and Jonathan Chew, who were both involved in the incident and appeared in the video, were prosecuted. Jonathan Chew was sentenced to eight weeks in prison in January after admitting harassment of Whitty on 29 June 2021. Lewis Hughes, who was sacked from his job as an estate agent after the incident, received a suspended sentence last July for his involvement. Asked about claims by the rapper Nicki Minaj that the coronavirus vaccine could make you impotent, Whitty said that people who “know they are peddling untruths … should be ashamed”. He said: “There are a group of people who have strange beliefs, and that’s fine … but there are also people who go round trying to discourage other people from taking a vaccine which could be life saving. “And many of those people, I regret to say, know that they are peddling untruths, and still do it. And in my view, they should be ashamed.” In December last year, as the Omicron wave started taking off, Whitty said that “people should prioritise what matters, and that by definition means de-prioritising other things”. “I think I would recommend that, and most people would recommend that, and you don’t need a medical degree to realise that is a sensible thing to do with an incredibly infectious virus”. At the time of Whitty’s comments, Independent Sage published a statement calling for an emergency circuit break lockdown given the rise of the Omicron variant, with numbers of infections doubling in England every two days.",News/World news,PowerPoint slides and exponential curves: Vallance and Whitty’s best bits,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/patrick-vallance-chris-whitty-best-bits-covid
2/26/2022,"UK households could suffer the biggest annual decline in their living standards since the 1950s as the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushes up global energy prices, experts have warned. With inflation already at the highest rate for 30 years, analysts said a sustained rise for wholesale oil and gas markets would further add to the squeeze on families from soaring utility bills. Analysts at Bank of America said that under such a scenario household real income could plunge by 3.1% in 2022 compared with a year earlier, in the biggest annual drop since at least 1956, the year of the Suez crisis. In what would mark a worse squeeze than during the oil shock of the 1970s, it comes after wholesale European gas prices rocketed on Thursday after Russian tanks rolled over the border in a full-scale invasion. Although gas prices fell back on Friday on a calmer day for financial markets, analysts warned they remained higher than the start of the week and could surge higher again should tensions between Moscow and the west escalate further. European stock markets closed higher on Friday with the FTSE 100 up 260 points, or 3.6%, while commodity prices reversed some of Thursday’s leaps. The oil price fell back from almost $106 per barrel to about $98, while wholesale gas prices dropped from 350p per therm to about 250p. However, this week’s increases have fed through to petrol and diesel prices at filling stations across Britain. The RAC said prices rose to new record highs for the fourth time this week, with unleaded at almost 150p per litre and the price of diesel above 153p for the first time ever. It comes with inflation already at the highest level since 1992, having reached 5.5% last month as the world economy grapples with the fallout from Covid-19. Even before the Russian invasion, the Bank of England forecast inflation would reach more than 7% in April when Ofgem, the UK energy regulator, increases its household price cap by 54% to reflect a winter surge in gas prices. However, analysts warned the conflict in Ukraine could drive up the inflation rate further still, possibly to more than 8% this year and remaining above the Bank’s 2% target rate for longer than previously thought. Should gas, electricity and oil prices persist at levels reached on Thursday, Bank of America said inflation could be about 1.9 percentage points higher than previously thought by the end of the year, sticking close to 6%. With growth of workers’ pay, benefits and other sources of income failing to keep pace, real household income could fall by 3.1% this year, “comfortably the largest calendar year fall since at least 1956”, according to the US bank. Robert Wood, UK economist at Bank of America, said: “There is a lot of volatility. Energy prices have subsequently dropped very sharply today, so the numbers wouldn’t look as negative for real incomes. It’s a risk scenario based on where energy prices got to on Thursday. We’re substantially below that now but there is always a risk they could go up again. “If inflation is higher there is a bigger fall for real incomes. We’re looking at this year a very large reduction in households spending power compared with previous years. How the economy navigates through that is quite uncertain.” The hit to living standards is expected to affect poorer households most, as lower-income families spend proportionally more on essentials such as energy and food than richer households. Weaker consumer spending power is also likely to act as a drag on economic growth, slowing the UK economy and raising questions over the Bank of England’s plans to raise interest rates and the government response to the cost of living crisis. “In time the conflict will also broaden and deepen the living standards squeeze here at home,” said Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank. “The chances of low- and middle-income households getting some respite from the growing squeeze on living standards later this year are receding rapidly.”",News/Business,"UK households face biggest fall in living standards since 1950s, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/26/uk-households-face-biggest-fall-in-living-standards-since-1950s-say-experts
