3/7/2022,"New South Wales has eight evacuation warnings in place for its central coastal region, including parts of Sydney, with forecasts of more heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding as a second east coast low looms in as many weeks. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning on Monday morning detailing the potential for more heavy falls: “Six-hourly rainfall totals between 70 and 120 mm are possible.” It said: “Heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding is forecast for the Mid North Coast, Hunter, Sydney Metropolitan area, Illawarra, South Coast, and parts of the Tablelands.” #Sydney’s Hawkesbury River region has many roads closed like this one: pic.twitter.com/r6AcIPqThP Sydney and surrounds are in for two more days of potentially heavy rain from an east coast low. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/ktAIXn5oTQ The NSW State Emergency Service has issued evacuation warnings for parts of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, which continues to flow at major flood levels at North Richmond. Levels were steady on Monday morning. “We’re asking everyone to be extra vigilant over the next three days,” said Shellie Smyth, an SES spokesperson. “Probably Tuesday would be the major impact if an East Coast Low actually develops over New South Wales.” Dams around Sydney were at 99.9% full and most were spilling on Sunday. The largest of them, Warragamba Dam, has been spilling since Wednesday morning. Last week’s spill rate reached 315 gigalitres a day – it reached 450GL a day day during the March 2021 floods. Warragamba Dam is still spilling, but the rate is at least declining for now. @BOM_au #nswfloods pic.twitter.com/Sm9Qc1QUUT Sydney and surrounds were forecast to have two more days of heavy rain, with falls approaching or exceeding 100mm possible. Flood evacuation warnings were in place for Wisemans Ferry, Picton’s central business district and parts of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River. As a second east coast low looms, Sydney is expected two more days of significant rain. (Similar total in inland regions). @BOM_au #NSWfloods pic.twitter.com/FlqAmuRMrz Wollongong to the south of Sydney may collect even more rainfall.

3/7/2022,"One of our scientists is missing. He’s been kidnapped from the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, possibly by Kremlin minions who want him to tell them how to make a neutron bomb 3,000 times more destructive than the one that hit Hiroshima. I’m not saying Nato’s nuclear secrets are poised to fall into the lap of a latter-day Napoleon overcompensating for his shortcomings with military barbarism, but it’s too soon to rule out the possibility. Thankfully, this is a TV review not a news story, but the contemporary resonances are unmissable, even if the makers of this six-part adaptation of Len Deighton’s 1962 thriller couldn’t have envisaged their audience would be playing extras in a real-life cold war sequel. The first thing we see in this new version of The Ipcress File (ITV) is a pair of thick-framed glasses on a nightstand, replicas of those Michael Caine wore in the 1965 film version of the book. Our hero is in bed in Berlin, while the woman who has been teaching him German, and more besides, waves to him saucily from the bath. This opening reference to 57-year-old movie eyewear is a surprising gambit by director James Watkins and writer John Hodge, given their creative betrayal elsewhere of the source material. One of the adaptation’s pleasures is also its peril: it invites us to compare Joe Cole’s interpretation with Caine’s. Fortunately, Cole is a Harry Palmer for our times. Imagine Stephen Merchant was a foot shorter and appropriated Damian Lewis’s pout. Imagine too that he is as taciturn as Alan Ritchson playing Jack Reacher. It’s not a showy performance, but all the better for that to punch up his rare bon mots. When asked what it was like fighting in Korea, Hodge has Palmer reply: “First I was bored. Then I was frightened. Then I was bored and frightened at the same time.” Which sounds about right. Just like the glasses making a comeback, perhaps the same is true of the leopard-skin pillbox hat. Though ridiculed by Bob Dylan, here it makes a grand entrance on the head of Lucy Boynton as Brit spy Jean Courtney, and she looks anything but ridiculous. With her tailored suits, thick eyeliner and bonkers titfer, Boynton is 2022’s homage to Alexandra Bastedo. Who, ask younger readers? Bastedo, in a series of unrepentantly daft 60s spy shows (The Champions, Department S), played the British secret weapon whose elegant froideur melted the patriarchy on both sides of the iron curtain. If only Boynton also had Bastedo’s powers of telepathy and superhuman strength, our nuclear boffin would already be back in Berkshire. But she doesn’t, so he isn’t. In the film, Courtney was a minor character. Here, Jean has nearly equal billing with Harry. She also flirts with an African American CIA agent, even though the agency at the time was about as diverse as Putin’s inner circle. This isn’t quite the woke retool of the Daily Mail’s nightmares, but I do fear it might collapse into tokenism. What remains intact from Deighton’s original is its snarling class politics. After he was fired from a writing gig on From Russia With Love, Deighton created a hard-boiled working-class spy as an antidote to 007’s public school boy. At the outset of this adaptation, Palmer is one of many bored servicemen lining their pockets on divided Berlin’s black market. Jailed for his crimes, Harry gets recruited by a posh-boy handler, Tom Hollander’s Major Dalby. Dalby realises that Palmer has the stuff that that oxymoron, British intelligence, needs to spring our boffin from East Berlin. He has underworld contacts, serviceable German, a degree in maths and a flexitarian moral code. Harry tells Dalby he was fingered by military police after importing lobsters from Marseille to sell to Russian ministers to keep their German mistresses happy. “For some unfathomable reason,” Palmer says in a rare moment of loquacity, “I never did get the Nobel peace prize.” “Must have been your working-class origins holding you back again,” retorts an oleaginous Dalby. Palmer doesn’t crack a smile. In that sense, he’s emblematic of the decline of deference of the early 60s, with all the misbegotten hopes for an egalitarian polity it catalysed. Palmer may not yet know that the enemy is within, that our secret services are corrupted by public school boys, but if the adaptation is faithful to the original in this, he will by episode two. What makes The Ipcress File worth reviving is that now, as then, the Etonian death grip on politics and public service imperils Britain more than any tooled-up Russian.",Arts/Television & radio,The Ipcress File review – a working-class hero takes on the might of Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/06/the-ipcress-file-review-a-working-class-hero-takes-on-the-might-of-russia
3/7/2022,"Jack Nowell has called on England to play “brave” rugby against Ireland at Twickenham on Saturday as they aim to stay in the race for the Six Nations title. The penultimate round is in effect an eliminator for both teams after England lost their opener against Scotland and Ireland were beaten by France in round two. Crossing the try-line is a priority for the two sides that retain realistic hope of overhauling Les Bleus, the grand slam-hunting championship leaders who have three wins out of three. England know that two bonus-point wins would secure the championship outright, provided they deprive France of a bonus point on the final day. The maximum 10 points now available for Ireland, who will host Scotland in their final match, would likely bring the title if France lose to Wales or England. “It is about being brave,” Nowell said. “We are being backed by the coaches, if we see that chance to ‘go’, it doesn’t matter where on the field, we want to try and give it a good go. There have been times with England, I think we’d all admit it … where we could have had chances to ‘go’ [but] maybe we’ve just dropped into a kick.” The Exeter wing added: “It’s just about playing what we’ve got in front of us. Obviously we’re not silly with it. We’re not chucking the ball around and trying to look for something that’s not on.” There has been much recent talk of a “New England” and an increased emphasis on attack, rather than defence and kick-chase, but Nowell concedes the back line has not yet achieved the fluency they are aiming for. England were outscored by three tries to one in the 23-19 victory against Wales, relying on Marcus Smith’s 18 points from the kicking tee to get over the line, and Nowell says they are trying to be more clinical. “We’re looking at all our clips from the Wales game and we realise how much we did leave out there,” he said. “There was a lot of positive stuff … We are running the ball a lot … It’s just now, it’s that next step … We need to be a bit more connected as a team, sometimes. Putting it on the field is our next step, and that’s what we’re working on.” Nowell, who said he is “desperate” to be involved at next year’s World Cup, added that he was “so angry” after failing a head injury assessment 16 minutes into his long-awaited international comeback against Italy, but also made it clear he understands why the head injury protocol is in place. “I think any rugby player, when they’re in that situation on the field, they’ll be like: ‘I’m fine, I want to carry on’,” Nowell said. “I could probably be knocked clean out and feel I’d recover in a few seconds to get back on and carry on with it. I think it’s important to take that decision out of our hands.”",Sport/Sport,Jack Nowell urges England to be brave against Ireland to sustain title hopes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/06/jack-nowell-england-ireland-six-nations-rugby-union
3/7/2022,"A host of real-life figures appeared. So did frenemies old and new. But is it goodbye, Ruby Shelby? Here’s your breakdown of Black Shirt. She was having visions of the devil last week. Happily, as doting dad Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy) arrived home from his transatlantic business trip, daughter Ruby (Orla McDonagh, who also appears in Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast) had recovered. Tommy took her straight for a checkup by Dr Robert (not that one). She got the all-clear. Credit that black Madonna magic. Instead, it was Tommy who needed a doctor. He was sleepless with worry and threw up again. Ever more detached, according to Lizzie (Natasha O’Keeffe), he was “speaking like you’re watching everything on a screen”. She later found him convulsing on the bathroom floor, flashing back to the first man he ever killed, a Prussian cavalryman in the French trenches. Evidence that he’s still fighting the war in his head. He suffered a similar seizure on the steamer from the US, then another in Westminster. Could it be his health, rather than another person, that defeats him? Before the credits rolled, Ruby had a worrying relapse. Her drawings looked disturbed and she heard voices coming from the chimney – except it wasn’t Santa. “The grey man is coming for me and daddy,” she told a terrified Lizzie. Is a Gypsy curse at play? Is she possessed by the spirit of Aunt Polly (Helen McCrory)? Did last week’s “green-eyed man” represent Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin), the ghost of Tommy’s Prussian foe or envious cousin Michael (Finn Cole)? More practically, was it tuberculosis? After all, Ruby was feverish and coughing up blood. Desperate times called for long-lost in-laws. Tommy summoned Esme Shelby (Aimee-Ffion Edwards), Gypsy widow of his murdered brother John (Joe Cole, now scheduled against his former cast-mates in The Ipcress File on ITV). Last seen at John’s funeral in series four, Esme always said the Shelbys were cursed. Can she help lift it? Either way, it’ll be fun to meet the firecracker again. He’s not just an import/export mogul and menswear icon. Tommy is also, of course, MP for Birmingham South. We saw him in parliament, putting forward a radical public housing bill while Mosley and Winston Churchill (Neil Maskell), in his backbench “wilderness years”, looked on approvingly. First, though, Tommy gave a rousing speech to the local Labour party, insisting that his comrades won’t be silenced by Westminster about wealth inequality. In the admiring audience was IRA contact Captain Swing (Charlene McKenna, who is increasingly resembling a member of La Résistance from ’Allo ’Allo!) – or Laura McKee, to use her real name. Tommy had been doing his homework. Over glasses of water in the Garrison – it was “four years, one month and six days” since Tommy’s last drink, not that he was counting – he laid out his proposal. American east coast crime kingpin Jack Nelson was en route to London, ostensibly to secure liquor licences but really on a fact-finding mission, gauging support for fascism on behalf of the new US president, Franklin D Roosevelt. Tommy and McKee would play along, meeting “Uncle Jack” at the idealistic intersection of socialism and nationalism. Tommy would arrange access to Mosley and other high-society Nazi sympathisers. She’d promise him the support of Dublin. In return, Nelson would let them ship opium into Boston. What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot, as sister Ada (Sophie Rundle) said: “You’re still looking for trouble big enough to kill you.” Tommy might do well to listen to his smartest sibling. Descending in an Angel Heart-like lift, shot through a red filter – the hell metaphors were hardly subtle – Tommy visited an old ally in the cellars beneath Camden Town. Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy) was listening to “fat people shouting” and planning the final act of his own operatic life. He might have become reclusive, but he still had a taste for scenery-chewing. First Tommy appealed to Alfie’s lust for vengeance by reminding him that his uncle Charles had been shot by rival gangsters in east Boston. He followed up with an offer to sell his opium to the city’s Jewish mob, tipping the balance of power back towards the Solomons family. Tommy was playing a dangerous double-crossing game. He can’t peddle his powdery wares to both sides of the Boston divide. Can he? As we met Mosley for the first time this series, he was fine-tuning the podium lighting for his fascist rally. The British Union of Fascists leader was now joined at the hip with his very own Lady Macbeth: future wife Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson), styling herself as “Oswald’s most recent and last ever mistress”. While protests raged outside, the couple schmoozed the Shelbys backstage, with several mentions of “our friend in Berlin”. Lady Di rattled Lizzie with her patronising barbs, like an aristocratic Mean Girl. Lizzie bit back by pointing out that she’d “fucked your future husband”. I don’t predict a firm friendship. Still, Mosley agreed to meet Nelson. Eyes on the prize, “Elizabeth”. Bad Santa fell off the sleigh again. Errant enforcer Arthur (Paul Anderson) got high on the Shelbys’ supply and was found in an alleyway with a needle hanging out of his arm. Just say no, kids. When Arthur made a shouty display of himself at Mosley’s rally, Tommy stepped in at last. He slapped some sense into his big brother and dangled a marital carrot. He’d tracked down Arthur’s estranged wife, Linda (Kate Phillips), and written asking for her “Christian forgiveness”. If Arthur stayed clean, he’d contact Linda again. It seemed to do the trick. The siblings celebrated in the traditional way – by brutally beating up a posse of Mosley’s blackshirts. Arthur’s return to match fitness will be welcome. He’s wasted being wasted. Where better for two “working-class Catholic boys” to rendezvous than church? We were finally introduced to Boston-Irish mob boss Jack Nelson (James Frecheville). Unlike many of Tommy’s cartoonish frenemies, Australian actor Frecheville played Jack with understated, smoothly sinister charm. The scene was shot in Liverpool Cathedral – actually an Anglican church but Britain’s biggest religious building, trivia fans. Nelson might be a fictional character but writer Steven Knight had clearly taken inspiration from Joseph P Kennedy Sr. The father of JFK, Ted and Bobby also imported Scotch whisky to the US post-prohibition, was an influential FDR ally, an antisemite and travelled here so regularly that he later became US ambassador to the UK. Once again, Tommy did his sales pitch. In exchange for access to Boston’s south side, he’d not only introduce Nelson to influential “like minds” but offer insider intel on Churchill’s anti-fascist strategies. If not, Tommy would sell his opium to the Jews. Political operator Nelson agreed to think about it. Just time for London-bound niece Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) to get in his ear. I enjoyed Tommy drily noting: “Moral Turpitude is a good name for a racehorse.” However, the prize goes to his summation of Aunt Polly’s politics: “Beneath all the gold and diamonds, mink and lace, she was a solid socialist.” What, no champagne? Alfie was listening to Puccini’s aria Nessun Dorma (a nod to Tommy’s insomnia?), while Mosley arrived to Death From Above’s aptly titled DieMonsterDie. We also got this series’ first airing of Nick Cave’s theme song over the closing credits. There’s a gathering storm all right. An amusing cameo from Arthur’s longsuffering babysitter Johnny Dogs (Packy Lee) with his eye-rolling mantra “For fock’s sake”. James Frecheville is best known as Joshua “J” Cody in Aussie gangster flick Animal Kingdom. In the TV version, the same character is portrayed by Finn Cole – yep, Peaky’s own Michael Gray. Still no sign of Stephen Graham’s mysterious new Liverpudlian character. Come ‘ed, lad. Stick a fiver each-way on Moral Turpitude, then share your thoughts, theories and Ruby diagnoses below …",Arts/Television & radio,"Peaky Blinders recap: series six, episode two – who is the grey man?",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/06/peaky-blinders-recap-series-six-episode-two-who-is-the-grey-man
