4/26/2022,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota’s longest-serving state senator announced Monday that he would resign following a report that he had traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Ray Holmberg, who rose to become one of the state’s most powerful lawmakers in a career that spanned 46 years, said he would resign effective June 1. His term was scheduled to end on Nov. 30 and he already had announced in March that it would be his last. “Recent news stories have become a distraction for the important work of the legislative assembly during its interim meetings,” Holmberg, 79, said in a statement announcing his resignation. “I want to do what I can, within my power, to lessen such distractions.” Holmberg did not immediately return messages from The Associated Press on Monday. His attorney, Mark Friese, said he didn't have anything to add beyond Holmberg's statement. Friese, a prominent North Dakota criminal defense attorney, said Tuesday that Holmberg hasn’t been charged with any crime, and there is no indication that he will. GOP Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement he “supports Sen. Holmberg’s decision to resign.” He did not elaborate. Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said he spoke with Holmberg earlier about his future in the Legislature. “No charges have been brought against Sen. Holmberg at this time ... he felt it was in the best interest to resign at this time,"" Wardner said. Days after the published report about his text messages, Holmberg had announced that he would step down as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature’s business between sessions. The Forum of Fargo reported April 15 that Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier. Prosecutors allege Morgan-Derosier possessed several thousand images and videos depicting sexually abused children. He also is accused of taking two children under the age of 10 from Minnesota to his Grand Forks home, with the intent of sexually abusing them. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges, then in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reported. He told the Forum that his text messages with Morgan-Derosier were related to “a variety of things,” including patio work Morgan-Derosier did for him. He also told the newspaper that he no longer has the text messages. “They’re just gone,” he said. Holmberg has been one of the Legislature’s most powerful lawmakers for decades, serving as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He chaired the Legislative Management committee, which decides committee assignments and chooses study topics that often inspire legislation, four times. He also sat on the state’s Emergency Commission, which allocates funding and resources in times of an emergency, and served on or chaired several GOP-led redistricting committees. When he announced in March that this would be his last term, he said the stress of a session and a campaign would “only exacerbate a weakened ability to concentrate on the matters at hand and effectively recall events.” Many North Dakota Republicans, including Burgum, showered Holmberg with accolades at the time. Holmberg will remain on the Legislature’s payroll through May and on its state-funded health insurance plan through July, a benefit that is worth about $1,425 monthly.",U.S./Associated Press,North Dakota lawmaker quits after child porn suspect texts,https://news.yahoo.com/north-dakota-lawmaker-quits-child-172043018.html

4/26/2022,"Avi Loeb, astronomy’s resident bad boy, suggests the universe may have been created in a laboratory. Our supposed creators, Loeb writes in an op-ed published in Scientific American last year, may have developed the technology needed to construct “baby universes” capable of producing life. He also introduces a new classification system for advanced civilizations. Could our universe have been created in a petri dish? Avi Loeb seems to think so. The Harvard astronomer posits that a higher “class” of civilization may have conjured up our universe in a laboratory far, far away. “Since our universe has a flat geometry with a zero net energy, an advanced civilization could have developed a technology that created a baby universe out of nothing through quantum tunneling,” Loeb writes in an op-ed published by Scientific American last year. This theory, he suggests, would unite two seemingly opposite notions: the idea that a higher power might be driving our fate, and the secular concept of quantum gravity (a field of physics that seeks to work gravity into the theory of quantum mechanics—something that, to the bane of physicists everywhere, we haven’t been able to do yet on Earth). Primarily, this theory hinges on a far-off advanced civilization’s ability to meld both quantum mechanics and gravity and subsequently identify and recreate all of the universe’s ingredients. (Sounds like a lot of work, t0 be honest.) He also introduces a new way of classifying exactly what makes a civilization advanced—one that veers away from Soviet astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev’s system, which organizes civilizations based on the amount of energy they generate and consume. According to Kardashev, Type I civilizations—greetings, Earthlings!—are only advanced enough to utilize the starlight that reaches their planet (4×1012 watts), while Type II civilizations have mastered the ability to fully harness their host star’s power (4×1026 watts). Dyson sphere, anyone? Type III civilizations, the final classification in his framework, are able to harness all of the energy within their galaxy (a whopping 4×1037 watts). Loeb, by contrast, has devised a framework that breaks advanced civilizations down into classes based on their ability to “reproduce the astrophysical conditions that led to its existence.” Earthlings would fall into class C because, as a “low-level” technological civilization, we would not be able to recreate our current conditions should the sun suddenly die. (He suggests we might even fall into the class D category because we’re actively destroying our only home.) On the other hand, class B civilizations, Loeb writes, are advanced enough to recreate the conditions in which they live, independent of their host star.  A class A civilization, like our proposed creators, would be able to, say, generate large amounts of dark energy and, as Loeb suggests, create “baby universes,” or smaller universes controlled by this higher civilization, that could potentially spawn life. He also suggests that, due to competition, only one advanced civilization at a time would be able to reach this level of sophistication. It’s a truly, truly bonkers idea, but it is interesting to think about. And it brings up a set of intriguing questions: What makes a civilization truly technologically advanced? Are we an advanced simulation? What might this “laboratory” look like, anyway?

4/26/2022,"A superyacht captain used sonic weapons to fend off pirates, an industry insider told The Times of London. They also deployed ""pain rays,"" which create a burning sensation on the skin, the worker said. The captain used the weapons against armed pirates approaching on inflatable boats, the worker added. The captain of a superyacht deployed sonic weapons and ""pain rays"" to fend off armed pirates in the Arabian Sea, according to an industry insider. ""Kalashnikov-wielding pirates"" were speeding towards the 230-foot yacht on inflatable boats, the anonymous worker, who spent 20 years in the superyacht business, wrote in The Times of London. The captain was said to have deployed an onboard weapon that directed ""ear-splitting, high-volume acoustics"" at the pirates. He was also said to have used ""pain rays"" – narrow beams of electromagnetic energy that trigger a burning sensation on the skin. The worker wrote in The Times: ""The threat of pirate attacks is all too real. In some areas, such as along the coast of Africa in the Gulf of Aden, it's even expected. Any protective technology worth having will find its way aboard a yacht."" Superyachts tend to be adorned with luxury features that make them attractive targets for pirates. A Russian businessman's yacht that was seized in the UK in March has a fresh-water swimming pool and a wine cellar, the UK government said. Meanwhile, a $120 million vessel detained in France features a swimming pool that converts into a helicopter pad and a sun deck with a jacuzzi, according to its maker Oceanco. The amenities on billionaire Roman Abramovich's $700 million superyacht Eclipse include a helipad, two swimming pools, and a dance floor, per SuperYacht Fan. Media reports have suggested the 553-foot vessel has a missile defense system but the anonymous worker wrote in the Times that this wasn't true. Abramovich, a Russian oligarch, is among the wealthy individuals who have been targeted by Western sanctions over their connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the Ukraine war. The sanctions have led to the freezing of oligarchs' assets and the seizure of their luxury yachts and private jets. The anonymous worker also detailed to The Times how a superyacht's crew prepared fresh lobster for its wealthy owner every day despite not knowing if he was on board, and how the crew of a yacht dressed in designer clothes that were thrown away by its owner after he wore them once.

4/26/2022,"PARIS (AP) — The far-right has gone mainstream in France. That’s the headline from the landmark showing by Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election. The fierce nationalist didn’t win Sunday. But she edged another step closer — snatching a victory of sorts from her defeat to reelected President Emmanuel Macron. With 41.5% of the vote, unprecedented for her, Le Pen's anti-foreigner, anti-system politics of disgruntlement are now more entrenched than ever in the psyche, thinking and political landscape of France. Since the Le Pen dynasty — first her dad, Jean-Marie, and now Marine, his daughter — first started contesting presidential elections in 1974, never have so many French voters bought into their doctrine that multicultural and multiracial France, a country with the words “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity” inscribed on its public buildings, would be richer, safer and somehow more French if it was less open to foreigners and the outside world. Had she become France’s first woman president, her plan for fighting Islamic terrorism would have included stripping part of France’s population – women who are Muslims – of some of their liberty. She wanted to ban them from wearing headscarves in public – hardly very equal or fraternal. Same goes for her proposals to move French citizens to the front of lines for jobs, benefits and housing. For headscarf-wearing voter Yasmina Aksas, Le Pen's defeat wasn't a celebration moment — not with such strong backing for her and ideas that “used to be limited to militant far-right groups” becoming increasingly acceptable in polite company. “It’s still 40% of people voting for Le Pen,"" the 19-year-old law student said. ""It’s not a victory.” Internationally, Le Pen wanted to start diluting France’s relationships with the European Union, NATO and neighbor Germany — moves that would have been seismic for the architecture of peace in Europe, in the midst of Russia's war in Ukraine. In short, France escaped a political, social and economic electroshock by not voting in Le Pen. Or perhaps just delayed one, should she choose to stand again in 2027. That's a long way off. Much could change. But Le Pen isn't done yet. “In this defeat, I can’t help but feel a form of hope,"" she said. “I will never abandon the French."" Surpassing 40% of the vote elevates Le Pen into illustrious, mainstream company. Since Gen. Charles de Gaulle beat François Mitterrand by 55% to 45% in 1965, all defeated finalists lost 40-something to 50-something. With two exceptions, both named Le Pen. Jean-Marie was trounced 82% to 18% by Jacques Chirac in 2002 and Marine lost 66% to 34% to Macron in 2017. Voters used to regard it as their civic duty to keep the Le Pens’ score low, seeing a ballot against them as a blow against racism and xenophobia. Fewer think that way now. By championing cost-of-living issues, befriending the working class, changing her party’s name and distancing herself from her father, Le Pen broadened her appeal and made herself less scary to growing swaths of France's electorate. Immigration isn't the top concern for all her supporters. They're not all wary of the EU, Muslims and foreigners. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels. And so although Macron became the first French president in 20 years to win a second term, he also has failed: Failed to achieve the goal that he set himself at the outset of his presidency. Five years ago, in his triumphant victory speech, Macron pledged to cut the ground from under Le Pen’s feet by assuaging the voter anger she feeds on. “I will do everything in the five years to come so there is no more reason to vote for the extremes,” he said. Yet France’s extremes are now doing better than ever, finding growing, enthusiastic and completely unabashed audiences for “us against them” far-right rhetoric. In far-right speak, “us” are largely white and Christian people being submerged by migration, impoverished by globalization, terrorized by Islamic fundamentalists and losing their French identity to imported cultures, religions and values. “Them” are all those they blame: the elites, foreigners, financiers, the EU, Muslims, “the system.” Their list is long. The market for their politics has become so large that this election saw several strains of extremism to choose from. Rabble-rousing former TV pundit Eric Zemmour, who has been repeatedly convicted of hate speech, placed fourth out of the 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10. He makes racial arguments that white French people risk being replaced by non-European immigrants and their children. He sugarcoated France’s collaboration with its Nazi occupiers in World War II. During his campaign, he filled auditoriums with audiences for his anti-Islam, anti-immigration invective. For Le Pen, he also had the advantage of making her look vanilla and electable in comparison, which also partly explains why she did so well. Together, the far right won 32% of the first-round vote. Now Le Pen has taken another step forward against Macron in the runoff. Not enough to get into power. But closer than ever. __ AP journalist John Leicester has reported from France since 2002.

4/26/2022,"Superintendent Cheryl James-Ward is reportedly filing a lawsuit against the San Dieguito Union High School District (SDUHSD) after its board placed her on administrative leave over her controversial remarks on Asian students.

James-Ward made the comments on April 11 during a board training session on diversity, equity and inclusion. After showing data which showed that Asian students receive fewer D and F grades compared to students of other ethnic or racial groups, Board Vice President and Trustee Michael Allman asked, “Do we know why Asian students do so well in school?”

In response, James-Ward said it is because those students are from rich families coming from China — a comment some parents and other critics later slammed as “racist.”

“We have an influx of Asians from China, and the people who are able to make that journey are wealthy,” James-Ward said. “You cannot come to America and buy a house for $2 million unless you have money.”

 

The superintendent went on to cite her own community in Carmel Valley as an example. She claimed that Chinese families have stronger support systems at home, while Latinx parents have jobs that prevent them from finding the time to help their children.

Critics have since accused James-Ward of racism and stereotyping by perpetuating the model minority myth. “I was totally shocked that someone with her experience, education and background could say some low-level things like that,” Jason Zho, a parent who was present at a school board meeting on April 13, told CBS 8.

Amid calls for her resignation, James-Ward apologized to the academic community. She also apologized in a letter sent to students’ families on April 13.

Due to the controversy, members of the school board voted 3-1 to place the superintendent on administrative leave on Wednesday. They then unanimously voted to make Associate Superintendent of Business Services Tina Douglas SDUHSD’s interim superintendent on Friday.

James-Ward, however, believes their decision was not motivated by her comments on Asian students. Instead, she says it was retaliation for her complaint against Allman in March, which remains under investigation.

“This is a retaliation case,” James-Ward’s attorney, Josh Gruenberg, told NBC San Diego. “No one gets fired for what she said.”

James-Ward told NBC San Diego that “Michael Allman is a bully.” She has not gone into detail about her complaint, but she claims that she will stand by it.

4/26/2022,"Indonesia, a top palm-oil exporter, is planning to ban exports beginning on Thursday. Palm oil, the world's most used vegetable oil, is used in cooking and a range of consumer products. Palm-oil and competing soybean-oil prices are jumping after news of the ban. The world's top palm-oil producer announced that it would ban exports of the commodity starting on Thursday, sending the prices of edible oils soaring. Indonesia accounts for about half of the world's supply of palm oil, the world's most widely used vegetable oil. Palm oil is used for cooking and for the production of thousands of consumer products, including biscuits, detergents, and lipsticks. In a video statement on Friday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said the move was designed to bring down domestic palm-oil prices and ensure domestic food availability in the wake of global food inflation. ""I will monitor and evaluate the implementation of this policy so availability of cooking oil in the domestic market becomes abundant and affordable,"" Widodo said, a Reuters translation reported. The move comes as Indonesia has seen recent protests over the high prices of cooking oil, with retail prices gaining more than 40% so far this year, Reuters reported. The ban is expected to be in place until further notice. Indonesian palm-oil exports were worth about $30 billion in 2021, the data provider Statista showed. Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Indonesia's finance minister, told Reuters on Friday that the palm-oil ban would hurt other countries, but that it was necessary to contain the soaring domestic prices of cooking oil. Benchmark crude palm-oil futures on the Bursa Malaysia exchange jumped as much as 7% on Monday morning. They are up over 40% year to date. Prices for alternative vegetable oil also spiked in response to the impending ban on palm-oil exports in Indonesia. Benchmark Chicago soybean oil prices hit their highest levels since 2008, Reuters reported. Prices of edible oil — including palm oil — have been rising because of the war in Ukraine, as the country is a large sunflower-oil exporter. ""Edible oils are often interchangeable, so a shortage of one type exerts pressure on the others,"" Gro Intelligence, a global agriculture data-analysis firm, wrote in an April 23 note. Gains in vegetable-oil prices are outpacing overall food-price increases, Gro Intelligence wrote in the report. US prices of a basket of common vegetable oils are up 41% on year, while food prices are up 25% on year. ""Indonesia's ban on exports is likely to further fuel global food inflation,"" the firm added.

4/26/2022,"Hours from the California coast, surfers are hoping one of the next spots where they can catch a wave is in the desert, where summer temperatures often soar above 100 degrees. At least four large surf lagoons are proposed for the region around Palm Springs, which is more commonly known for art festivals, mountain hikes and golf, and has no natural waves in sight. But some environmentalists and residents say it isn't water-wise to build large resorts in one of the driest spots in California during one of its driest periods in recent memory. They contend water in the massive surf pools will evaporate quickly in the desert heat, wasting a precious resource, while proponents argue the waves will boost tourism, ramp up recreation and use less water than ever-popular golf courses. “Is that their best use of the limited water resources in these climate-driven drought times, is golf courses and surf spots?” said Conner Everts, executive director of the Southern California Watershed Alliance. “It’s like a fantasy. It’s like Dubai.” California is going through a relentless drought, worsened by climate change, and its nearly 40 million residents have faced repeated calls in recent years to conserve water. The greater Palm Springs area sits atop a groundwater aquifer but receives remarkably little rainfall and relies on water from the State Water Project, which is running below capacity, and the Colorado River, a critical U.S. water supplier that is overtaxed. Local water district officials say there’s enough water in a 20-year plan to support the new wave pools and resorts. The proposals, which range from private, luxury communities to a public wave park, come as surfing soars in popularity in the United States. It became an Olympic sport last year, and industry experts forecast its continued growth as travel recovers following pandemic shutdowns and amid a rise in inland surf parks, according to San Jose-California-based Global Industry Analysts Inc. Cheyne Magnusson, a pro surfer who is revamping a Palm Springs water park and adding a wave pool, is counting on that. He said the area is ideal because so many die-hard surfers live within driving distance and waves can be unreliable at the beach. It's also a popular vacation spot, he said, and beginners might want to try surfing in a safe environment. “A lot of people have a day off today, and they really want to go surfing. I can guarantee they are going to get a good wave, and they're going to get a lot of them,” said Magnusson, who helped develop a wave park in landlocked Waco, Texas. Magnusson's project is under construction, and two others are approved. In nearby La Quinta, a proposed 400-acre (160-hectare) development around a half-mile-long (0.8-kilometer) wave basin faces opposition from homeowners who moved to the area in search of a quiet retirement community. They say the proposed Coral Mountain development will draw noisy surf festivals and ruin stargazing with its glaring lights. And they're concerned the pool's anticipated annual use of 120 acre-feet of water — in addition to the water used in the development's 600 homes, hotel and retail outlets — will deplete community water supplies. In 2016, one acre-foot was enough water for between three and four California households for a year, according to the nonprofit Water Education Foundation. “With the evaporation and the wind and everything that is going to happen...,” said Alena Callimanis, a member of the group La Quinta Residents for Responsible Development, “the optics of this are just crazy.” But John Gamlin, president of CM Wave Development, noted the wave basin will use eight to 10 times less water than a golf course, and golf course already has been approved for the site. He said many local backyard swimming pools use drinking water, but the basin will use non-potable water treated in an onsite filtration plant. “At the end of the day we’re confident that the Coral Mountain project will be among the most responsible water users in the Valley,” Gamlin said in an email, adding that residential areas and open spaces, which account for most the project’s outdoor water use, will also use non-potable water. The Coachella Valley Water District, which serves much of the region, said whether to build projects is up to local officials, but the water is there. While the groundwater basin's storage hit a low in 2009, supplies have since improved through replenishment efforts and conservation, said Lorraine Garcia, a district spokesperson. Critics, however, note the district has replenished the groundwater with imported water sources, and these are limited. State officials recently said water agencies will receive 5% of what they requested this year beyond what's needed for critical activities such as drinking and bathing in what has been the driest start to a California year in at least a century. The conditions come amid a tourism boom in greater Palm Springs, which became a travel destination over a century ago when residents sought out the hot, dry climate believing it was good for their health. In the past decade, more younger visitors have come for music and art festivals, said Scott White, president of Visit Greater Palm Springs. “To me, the surf parks just make natural sense,” White said. Desert resident and surfer Dave Hilts said he’d like to try out the wave pools for extra practice — though he'd still drive to the beach regularly to surf. He started the Coachella Valley Surf Club to give kids from low-income inland families a chance to surf and is working with a teacher who began a surf club at her desert high school. “It is going to bring a lot of new people into surfing that could never surf before,” he said. That growth, however, worries Ruth Langridge, a senior researcher at University of California, Santa Cruz focused on water law and policy. She said she's long been wary of large-scale development in the desert because of the water demand — from pools or otherwise. “You can fallow an agricultural area, but you can’t fallow a city once you build it,” Langridge said. “There’s a real concern about development in places where there isn’t going to be sufficient water.”",U.S./Associated Press,Surge of desert surf parks stirs questions in dry California,https://news.yahoo.com/surge-desert-surf-parks-stirs-164354950.html
4/26/2022,"Mark Meadows texted with Trump’s family, Jan. 6 rally organizers, right-wing media personalities, and over 40 Republican members of Congress between Election Day and President Biden’s inauguration just over two months later, CNN reported on Monday. The messages, which have been obtained by the Jan. 6 committee, make clear that the former chief of staff was the Trump administration’s point person for the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and that the effort extended throughout the Republican Party. One of the dozens of GOP lawmakers communicating with Meadows during the time between the election and the inauguration was Marjorie Taylor Greene, the conspiracy theorist from Georgia who just last Friday testified under oath about her alleged role in the events of last Jan. 6. Greene, who has repeatedly defended those who stormed the Capitol, appeared to have done so on the morning of Jan. 7, as well.

Jamie Raskin Says “Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault,” she wrote. “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.” Greene later advocated for President Trump to institute martial law in order to stay in office. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall [sic] law,” she wrote on Jan. 17. “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” Greene on Friday testified under oath that she could “not recall” discussing martial law. She gave similar responses about several questions pertaining to Jan. 6.

This, too, appears to contradict her testimony on Friday. “We were so confused,” she said under oath, speaking about when she was first made aware that the building had been breached. “We thought antifa was breaking in, or BLM.” Greene wrote Meadows later last Jan. 6 that “we don’t think these attackers are our people” and that she believed they were antifa members “dressed like Trump supporters,” but the texts make clear that when when the situation was first developing she believed Trump would have sway over the rioters.

We thought Antifa or BLM was breaking in pic.twitter.com/rT52pHpt9o — Acyn (@Acyn) April 22, 2022 Rolling Stone reported last October that Greene was one of several members of Congress who participated in the planning of the rally near the White House that preceded the riot.

I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board.

4/26/2022,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Marine Corps this month declared its new heavy lift helicopter operational, following the completion of test, training and sustainment requirements. Deputy Commandant for Aviation Lt. Gen. Mark Wise on April 22 determined the Sikorsky-made CH-53K King Stallion had achieved initial operational capability. The service announced the milestone April 25. The CH-53K provides a significantly improved capability over the CH-53E Super Stallion. The 53K’s requirement includes flying 110 nautical miles while carrying 27,000 pounds of cargo internally or externally — essentially carrying three times more weight than the 53E can under comparable conditions. Operationally, this means the 53K can transport a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle from an amphibious ship at sea to a position well inland, something the legacy helicopter cannot do. The King Stallion proved through testing it can also carry greater weight, travel longer distances or fly in more strenuous environmental conditions, allowing operators to trade off the variables to meet mission needs. “My full confidence in the CH-53K’s ability to execute the heavy lift mission is the result of successful developmental and operational testing conducted by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (HX) 21 and Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron (VMX) 1″ Wise said in a Marine Corps statement. The CK-53K was previously expected to reach IOC in late 2019 or early 2020, but the program ran into significant technical challenges in early 2019. The highest profile challenge was an exhaust gas re-ingestion problem, where the hot and dirty exhaust from the three engines was being sucked back up, rather than the engines taking in clean air. The Navy, Marines and Sikorsky had to turn their attention to addressing this technical issue because the exhaust re-ingestion was causing problems ranging from increased maintenance needs and higher life-cycle costs to maintain the helicopter to the engines overheating and even stalling during flight tests. The Navy and Marine Corps announced in December 2019 they had resolved that problem and could continue on with the test plan. During the subsequent initial operational test and evaluation period, the 53K flew more than 3,000 mishap-free hours in various temperatures, altitudes and terrains. It even rescued a Navy MH-60S helicopter that was disabled on a mountainside in California after a hard landing. The Navy thought the only way to recover the helo would be to cut it into pieces, since no other aircraft in the military could reach it on a rugged mountainside at a high altitude — but on Sept. 5, Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron One (VMX-1) used one of its CH-53Ks to retrieve the MH-60. According to the Marine Corps statement, the 53K can produce 57% more horsepower and has 63% fewer parts, contributing to a lower maintenance requirement and more operational time for the helicopters. Earlier this month, heavy lift helicopter program manager Col. Jack Perrin told reporters Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron (HMH) 461 had its first two helos and would have four by the end of April. At the time, he said the Marines just had to verify training and logistics requirements before declaring IOC, after the test program had already proven out almost all the IOC requirements. Perrin said the helicopter should enter full-rate production by fiscal 2023 and will go on its first operational deployment with a Marine expeditionary unit in FY24.",World/Defense News,Marine Corps declares its heavy lift helicopter operational,https://news.yahoo.com/marine-corps-declares-heavy-lift-180940691.html
4/26/2022,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Monday to create a police force dedicated to pursuing voter fraud and other election crimes, embracing a top priority of Republicans after former President Donald Trump's false claims that his reelection was stolen. The new law comes after the Republican governor made voting legislation a focus this year, pushing the Republican-controlled statehouse to create the policing unit as states reevaluate their own election systems in the wake of Trump's unfounded allegations. DeSantis, who is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential 2024 presidential candidate, has both praised the last election as smooth and suggested more rules were needed to deter fraud, underscoring Trump's lingering influence on Republican policymaking. Critics have deemed the law politically motivated and unnecessary, arguing that local prosecutors can handle election crimes. At a bill signing ceremony Monday at a sports bar in Spring Hill, Florida, DeSantis justified the need for the new law enforcement unit and suggested that existing law enforcement may not be equipped or willing to thoroughly investigate fraud cases. “Some of them may not care as much about the election stuff. I think it's been mixed at how those reactions are going to be. So we just want to make sure whatever laws are on the books, that those laws are enforced,"" he said. Voter fraud is rare, typically occurs in isolated instances and is generally detected. An Associated Press investigation of the 2020 presidential election found fewer than 475 potential cases of voter fraud out of 25.5 million ballots cast in the six states where Trump and his allies disputed his loss to President Joe Biden. Republicans nationwide have stressed the need to restore public confidence in elections and have passed several voting laws in the past two years aimed at placing new rules around mail and early voting methods that were popular in 2020. The law creates an Office of Election Crimes and Security under the Florida Department of State to review fraud allegations and conduct preliminary investigations. DeSantis is required to appoint a group of special officers from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement who would be tasked with pursuing the election law violations. Existing state law allowed the governor to appoint officers to investigate violations of election law but did not require him to do so. The law also increases penalties for the collection of completed ballots by a third party, often referred to as ballot harvesting, to a felony. It raises fines for certain election law violations and requires that election supervisors perform voter list maintenance on a more frequent basis. Democrats, the minority party in the state Legislature, have criticized the bill as a way for DeSantis to appeal to Republican voters who believe the 2020 election results were fraudulent, while the governor flirts with a presidential run of his own. “DeSantis’ so-called election reform legislation is a continued attack by the Republican Party to generate public distrust in the integrity of our elections. The bill is unnecessary and a waste of taxpayer funds,"" said Rep. Tracie Davis, a Democrat. In late March, a federal judge struck down portions of a sweeping election law passed last year in a blistering ruling that alleged the state's Republican-dominated government was suppressing Black voters, and ordered that attempts to write similar new laws in the next decade must have court approval. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker overturned a provision of last year's law limiting when people could use a drop box to submit their ballot, along with a section prohibiting anyone from engaging with people waiting to vote. He also blocked a section that placed new rules on groups that register voters, including one requiring that people working to register voters submit their names and permanent addresses to the state. The DeSantis administration is working to reverse Walker's ruling.",Politics/Associated Press,Florida governor signs bill creating election police unit,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-governor-signs-bill-creating-194812421.html
4/26/2022,"Members of a San Diego, California, community are outraged after a 16-year-old white male pleaded not guilty to charges connected to an altercation that left a Black girl with multiple stab wounds in her back. Authorities are considering the act a hate crime, as moments before the assault, the boy and other teens allegedly hurled racial slurs at the African-American teen. On Thursday, April 21, the suspect, whose name is being withheld because he is a minor, told the courts he did not stab the young lady — who also is 16 years old — in the back on Saturday, April 16, in front of a group of her family members at the Woodglen Apartments on the 12000 block of Mapleview Street in Lakeside, CA, not far from state Route 67. The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said the incident happened around 11 p.m. and stemmed from an earlier altercation between different but related parties. The white teen gathered with others to approach the Black teen and her relatives, Lt. Shawn Wray said, which led to a fight. During the melee, the girl was stabbed twice, and the young man ran off with his associates. She was taken to the hospital to have her injuries treated. On Monday, April 18, the boy turned himself in. His girlfriend was also arrested; however, she was released even though she allegedly waved a weapon before the fight began. The teen’s defense lawyer requested he be released to his family on home supervision and GPS monitoring, but the request was denied by Superior Court Judge Richard Monroy. Because of the flagrant use of racial epithets, a special hate crime count, packaged with an allegation of personal use of a deadly weapon and an allegation of personal infliction of great bodily injuries, will be attached to the charges of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. If he is found guilty, he could receive up to 17 years in prison. According to The San Diego Union-Tribune, at the hearing in a San Diego Juvenile Court on Thursday, the boy’s parents, grandmother and other family members where there to support him. The girl, whose injuries have not been disclosed, was also in attendance with her mother, aunts and grandparents. Wray, who leads the department’s Lakeside substation, said “it is the first hate crime that is being investigated in Lakeside in 2022.” District Attorney Summer Stephan, who was elected to prosecute crimes across San Diego County, is looking to see what other charges can be leveraged against “other individuals involved” in the attack. During a town hall meeting at the Lakeside Community Center on Tuesday, April 19, more than 100 activists and members of the community challenged the sheriff’s office to be vigilant in bringing justice to the high school student, NBC San Diego reported. As Wray opened the floor for questions, “This was almost a murder!” was proclaimed from the audience. Judy Jensven, a Lakeside resident, said, “Let’s go after this punk’s parents. They learn this hate somewhere.” Detectives said they are investigating to see if the boy’s father was in the crowd yelling derogatory slurs and is culpable for the crime. “You’re setting a dangerous [expletive] precedent if you don’t arrest the father,” one person stated. Another person co-signed saying, “While you investigate, he should be in jail.” Lisa Weinreb, chief deputy of the juvenile branch of the District Attorney’s Office, who was present at the community talk, addressed arresting the father, “While it is horrific, horrific behavior, I can’t prosecute a parent for standing by.” “We are dictated by the law and the law doesn’t allow somebody, and it specifically says if they were standing as a bystander and did nothing more, then it’s not a crime.” The DA added, “Multiple aspects of this incident are appalling and as our investigation moves forward, we will be sure to hold everyone accountable for whom the evidence shows committed a crime.” Activists believe that the handling of the case is colored by the county’s history of racism. Danielle Wilkerson of the East County BIPOC Coalition said, “It’s a running joke that East County is racist.” “You’ve heard Klantee, you’ve heard White Hills, all the things people put a layer of humor on, but that racism is real and alive, and we had a victim this week,” Wilkerson said. Stephan recognized the validity in Wilkerson’s assertion, saying her office has seen a “disturbing increase in hate crimes, with the highest number being committed against persons who are Black.” She further presented startling facts: her office filed 21 hate crime cases in 2020 and 30 cases in 2022. The two-hour conversation culminated with a promise to address the larger issues of racially-inspired violence in the coming months, KPBS reported. Some people in the audience, like San Diego activist Tasha Willamson, thought the promise was empty. “I feel like this was fluff,” she said after the meeting. “This is a new lieutenant who has no clue what he has stepped into or may have a clue but is not sure of the severity.” A spokesperson for the housing development where the stabbing happened released a statement about the violence that occurred saying, “We have a zero-tolerance policy towards violence of any kind, and we stand firmly against any acts of hate. Our top priority is our community’s safety and well-being, and we are actively assisting the ongoing investigation.” The teen has been ordered to stay away from the victim, her mother and her sister and is due back in court June 6.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"‘Let’s Go After This Punk’s Parents’: California Teen Pleads Not Guilty to Attempted Murder, Hate Crime Allegations After Allegedly Stabbing a Black Girl In the Back with His Father Reportedly Present",https://news.yahoo.com/let-punk-parents-california-teen-150000748.html

4/26/2022,"Fox News host Neil Cavuto just could not make his viewers happy Saturday, with many either questioning why he was coming down so hard on Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody over a new state law dissolving Walt Disney World’s self-governing status, or questioning why he wasn’t coming down hard enough in an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci. Speaking with Moody, Cavuto asked what she thought the fallout will be from this, because some fear it’s going to mean higher taxes, “particular in the counties affected that include the Magic Kingdom.” Moody responded the special district was set up “because they thought it was in the best interest of the state to do that and had not been reviewed or reevaluated.” She went on to say the situation has changed, where Florida lawmakers were acting on parents’ right as to what their children were taught in school. “And you had this company come out that had been given so much autonomy and control within the state, come out and specifically in a very fraudulent, false way start this smear campaign against lawyers,” she said. Fox News host Neil Cavuto returned to Your World on Tuesday following a brief hiatus, and was greeted by a litany of vitriolic emails, which the host happily read for his viewers. But first, he kicked off the show by acknowledging that some people would have preferred his hiatus was something more permanent.
“Okay, I'm back! Now, I thought that would be good news because I missed you guys while I was away. But apparently, it wasn't always mutual,” Cavuto said. “Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto and this is Your World, and a lot of you preferred having Your World with someone else doing the show, apparently.”
The emails, which Cavuto would later call “healthy ribbing,” attacked him from all angles.
“Damn, you're still alive?!! I kept looking in the obituaries but I knew something was up when I couldn’t find you,” the first email read, to which Cavuto replied, “Sorry to keep disappointing you.”
The next email read, “I don't know what you have on your bosses, but the only place I want to see your ugly moon face is on a milk carton!” “Moon face?” Cavuto responded. “I think they’re saying I’m fat.”
One email made Cavuto feel the need to defend himself, but not because the person who wrote it preferred his fill-ins.
“Charles Payne has class. Sandra Smith has style. The only thing you have is a bad voice and an even worse TOUPE [sic]. Yet you're still on the air,” The viewer wrote. “Is this a great country or what, Cavuto?” “Alright, for once and for all, this is not a toupee,” Cavuto responded. “It's paint.” Cavuto pushed back with: “I understand all your concerns on how this law was misinterpreted. I get that. But that this is going after them with a sledgehammer here, and under 50-plus years of Republican and Democrat governors, no one is threatened or taken action like this. They were all fine with this special exemption that Disney enjoyed because it benefited Disney benefited Florida… do you think you are going too far?” Cavuto’s provocative question came in reaction to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signing a bill on Friday that would eliminate Disney World’s private government, a move thought to have been provoked by Disney’s opposition of a new state law dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.” Disney has vowed to work toward repealing the controversial law that prohibits classroom instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity for some younger age groups in the state. The newly approved bill would eliminate Disney’s Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the government is known, as well as other similar districts by June 2023. The measure allows for the districts to be reestablished, leaving an avenue to renegotiate its future. The law would have significant tax implications for Disney.

In the interview, Cavuto said that Adams was getting a “collective Bronx cheer” from New Yorkers and pushed Fauci to offer an opinion on the vaccine exemption being for athletes and entertainers only: “Why couldn’t it be for everybody,” but Fauci remained evasive, calling it a “delicate situation” and saying he did not want to comment on the local decision.

4/26/2022,"Rep. Jamie Raskin said former VP Mike Pence's refusal to vacate the Capitol building was ""chilling."" During the Capitol riot, Pence's security agents tried to convince him to get into a car away from the premises. ""I'm not getting in the car,"" Pence told his lead security agent. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said it was ""chilling"" to learn that former Vice President Mike Pence refused to leave the Capitol as insurrectionists stormed the building. During the January 6 insurrection last year, rioters, emboldened by former President Donald Trump, clashed with police and breached the Capitol building as lawmakers met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. Since the Capitol riot, lawmakers and law-enforcement officers have been coming forward to detail the trauma they say they experienced. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, said she thought she was going to be raped and killed. She said she and a staffer hid in the bathroom while a group of angry Trump supporters chanted her name. In the middle of the mayhem, it was previously reported that Pence, charged with leading the certification, refused to leave the Capitol. Secret Service agents swiftly escorted Pence into his ceremonial office, but they feared the rioters would shatter the room's glass windows. So they ""twice"" asked him to evacuate the building, according to an account of the events as reported by Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig. ""I'm not leaving the Capitol,"" Pence said. He refused to get into an armored limousine. ""I trust you, Tim, but you're not driving the car,"" Pence told his lead security agent, Tim Giebels. ""If I get in that vehicle, you guys are taking off. I'm not getting in the car."" The moment stuck with Raskin, who serves on the House panel tasked with investigating the Capitol riot. Pence ""uttered what I think are the six most chilling words of this entire thing I've seen so far: 'I'm not getting in that car,'"" Raskin said earlier this week, according to NBC News. ""He knew exactly what this inside coup they had planned for was going to do,"" Raskin said. So far, more than 810 people have been charged in connection with the insurrection, according to Insider's database. In many cases, the FBI used social media posts to identify attendees. Leading up to the Capitol riot, Republican lawmakers plotted with Trump and his aides to stop Biden from taking the presidency, according to testimony from an aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.

""They have moved to terror - to preparing the murder of our journalists,"" Putin said of the West. Putin, a former KGB spy who has ruled Russia as paramount leader since the last day of 1999, did not immediately provide evidence to support his statements and Reuters was unable to immediately verify the accusations. FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov said a group of six neo-nationalist Russian citizens had plotted to kill Solovyev - one of Russia's most high-profile TV and radio journalists - at the behest of Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU). The SBU denied the allegations, which it said were fantasies cooked up by Moscow. ""The SBU has no plans to assassinate V. Solovyev,"" it said in a statement. Solovyev, a host of talk shows whose guests often denigrate Ukraine and justify Moscow's actions there, thanked the FSB. RUSSIA THE TARGET Putin said the West had realised that Ukraine could not beat Russia in war so had moved to a different plan - the destruction of Russia itself. ""Another task has come to the fore: to split Russian society and destroy Russia from within,"" Putin said. ""It is not working."" Putin said foreign media organisations and social media had been used by the West's spies to confect provocations against Russia's armed forces. Prosecutors should react swiftly to fake news and reports that undermined order, Putin said, without giving any specific examples. ""They are often mainly organised from abroad, organised in different ways - either the information comes from there or the money,"" Putin said. Prosecutors should fight extremism ""more actively"", Putin said. Just days after ordering the invasion of Ukraine, Putin signed a law that imposes a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military. Russia says the Western media have provided an excessively partial narrative of the war in Ukraine that largely ignores Moscow's concerns about the enlargement of NATO and what it says is the persecution of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Ukraine was guilty of the genocide of Russian-speaking people. Ukraine says it is fighting a land grab by Russia and that Putin's accusations of genocide are nonsense.

4/26/2022,"Donald Trump’s one-time personal attorney Michael Cohen had a fit Sunday after his former boss yet again boasted that he aced an intelligence test in the White House that was actually an assessment to check for cognitive impairment. And that was just one of the “stupid, stupid” things Trump said at a political rally in Ohio on Saturday, a revved up Cohen complained in a video by the Meidas Touch PAC. Trump told the crowd he took the 2018 test to prove he was more intelligent than “radical left maniacs.” As has been explained repeatedly in the media, it was actually a Montreal Cognitive Assessment, designed to detect things like early signs of dementia — not intelligence. The questions are simple, and ask if the test subject can, for example, identify a camel, and remember five words — in Trump’s case, “person, woman, man, camera, TV” — which he has demonstrated he could do on TV. Cohen mocked Trump’s five words and how spectacularly unimpressive reciting them are. “The only people who are amazed are you, you and you,” he snapped. Yet “nobody really actually called you on it.” If Trump has such an impressive IQ, Cohen wondered, why did he have to write letters to all of Trump’s schools warning them not to release his grades or test scores? Cohen also asked why people still go to Trump rallies. “Is it to watch a shit show? To watch the clown carnival barker?” he asked. Cohen ended with a plea for everyone to vote. “I know the man better than all, and rest assured, this man does not belong in the White House,” he said. Check it out here: Trump bragged about his intelligence in the same speech in which he forgot the name of his new social media platform, calling it “Troth Sential.” He got it later, but it was the kind of gaffe that would have had him screaming for Joe Biden’s resignation had the president said it.

4/26/2022,"FIRST ON FOX: Hunter Biden sent an email to his brother’s widow, Hallie Biden, pressuring her to get an HIV test as their relationship deteriorated in July 2018, about a month before he fathered a child with another woman. In an email titled, ""YOU NEED TO GET TESTED FOR HIV HALLIE,"" obtained by Fox News Digital, Hunter demanded that Hallie get tested for HIV and inform him of the results that day. The email also accused Hallie of turning Hunter’s niece against him and called on Hallie to seek ""serious long term professional help."" HUNTER BIDEN’S EX-LOVERS COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT HIM AS FEDERAL GRAND JURY INVESTIGATES HIS TAX AFFAIRS ""You need to inform me of the result. TODAY,"" Hunter wrote at the time. ""I am getting tested today. I have been sick scared Hallie and you [hang] up on me. The love you give is so disturbing."" ""I love you [Hallie] even when you’re cruel,"" he added. ""GET TESTED AND TELL ME RESULTS Today."" In earlier email exchanges that same month, Hallie called Biden a ""passive aggressive a--hole"" and Hunter advised her to ""focus on your sobriety."" ""I hope you have someone to turn to in bed in my brothers’ house and that that act of love can be for him or her or them and not a secret someone,"" Hunter wrote to Hallie on July 15, 2018. ""And don’t feel as if you lost the two best men you or anyone could have ever even dreamed of."" Hunter revealed the details of his affair with Hallie in his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" explaining that he and Hallie started a relationship in 2016 about a year after his brother, Beau, died of brain cancer. Hunter said he successfully convinced his dad, now-President Joe Biden, to issue a statement condoning the affair in 2017 after he was initially reluctant to offer public support. ""We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness,"" the elder Biden said in a statement. ""They have mine and Jill’s full and complete support and we are happy for them."" BIDEN ‘TRYING TO HIDE’ WHO HE HAS MET WITH, PETER SCHWEIZER SAYS Hunter was married to Kathleen Buhle but separated at the time of the affair, and the two finalized their divorce in April 2017. During that same time, while living with Hallie, Hunter started a sexual relationship with Hallie’s older sister, Elizabeth Secundy, in addition to ex-stripper Lunden Roberts. In July 2018, the same month that Biden sent his email to Hallie demanding she get an HIV test, Hunter was infamously blacklisted from the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles due to his drug use over the course of five months staying at the hotel, according to Miranda Devine’s book ""Laptop from Hell."" One month later, in August 2018, Hunter’s child with Roberts was born. Hunter and Hallie eventually split in late 2018, which became public in 2019. In one email Hunter sent to Hallie in December 2018, Hunter called her a ""clueless, middle-aged, over botoxed flat a-- loser."" One day later, Hallie responded, in part, ""Please stop the nasty emails and anger. I’m not against you."" Hunter's jab at Hallie came in response to an email from the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children's Vice-Chair Fred Sears to Hallie, Hunter, and Valerie Biden Owens, the younger sister of President Biden, discussing salary arrangements for Josh Alcorn. Alcorn was serving as the Beau Biden Foundation's ""Chief Operating Officer"" at the time. Biden initially denied being the father of Roberts’ child, claiming in his memoir that he had ""no recollection"" of Roberts. In January 2020, an Arkansas judge ruled that Hunter was the ""biological and legal father"" of Roberts’ child and ordered Hunter to pay back child support. In February of this year, Roberts became the latest to testify in response to subpoenas issued in the Department of Justice's investigation into Biden's finances. Hunter's ex-girlfriend, lingerie entrepreneur Zoe Kestan, also recently testified before the grand jury in Delaware, the New York Post reported. Kestan reportedly told the grand jury about Hunter's lavish spending habits at luxury hotels in New York and California. Hunter, who is now married to South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen, first revealed in December 2020 that his ""tax affairs"" were under federal investigation. David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware, is overseeing the investigation. The Senate Homeland Security Committee and Senate Finance Committee conducted an investigation in 2020 into Hunter's foreign business dealings during his father's tenure as vice president and discovered that there were at least four large transactions that banks flagged as ""potential criminal activity"" to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Fox News inquiries sent to Hallie and Hunter’s lawyer went unreturned.

4/26/2022,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's acting defence minister said on Sunday that the Taliban administration would not tolerate ""invasions"" from its neighours after protesting against airstrikes it says were conducted by neighbouring Pakistan. The comments come after the Taliban administration blamed Pakistan for airstrikes that officials say killed dozens in Kunar and Khost provinces. Pakistan, which has not confirmed any involvement in airstrikes inside Afghanistan's borders, said the two countries are ""brotherly countries"". ""We are facing problems and challenges from both the world and our neighbors, the clear example is invasion by them in our territory in Kunar,"" said Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, acting Afghan defence minister, at a ceremony in Kabul commemorating the anniversary of the death of his father, Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar. ""We can't tolerate the invasion. We have tolerated that attack. We tolerated that because of national interests, next time we might not tolerate it,"" he said. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson said when asked for comment on Yaqoob's comments that Pakistan hoped for longterm engagement with Afghanistan to secure peace. ""Pakistan and Afghanistan are brotherly countries. The governments and people of both countries regard terrorism as a serious threat and have suffered from this scourge for long time ... therefore, it is important that our two countries engage in a meaningful manner through relevant institutional channels to cooperate in countering cross border terrorism and taking actions against terrorist groups on their soil,"" the spokesperson said. The Taliban administration's foreign ministry last week called in Pakistan's ambassador to protest against the strikes. Local officials said the strikes by Pakistan military helicopters killed 36 people. The United Nation's children's agency head in Afghanistan said that 20 children were killed in airstrikes in Khost and Kunar on April 16. Since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August, there have been numerous standoffs along the 2,600-km (1,615-mile) border with Pakistan - drawn by British colonial rulers and disputed by Kabul. Increasingly frustrated by continuing militant attacks, Pakistan's military has stepped up operations along the Afghan border in recent months.
