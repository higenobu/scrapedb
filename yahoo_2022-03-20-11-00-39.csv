3/20/2022,"Next Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA) will hold its annual Analyst Day. Deutsche Bank’s Ross Seymore expects the chip giant to deliver a “characteristically positive message.” The analyst thinks the company will showcase a multitude of industry-leading developments across its various segments. For Data Center, having called for a $100 billion TAM (total addressable market) figure by 2024 at the 2020 Analyst Day, Seymore will be hoping for an updated figure for the projected TAM. An update on the way forward for the Cloud business will also come in handy, following the doubling of revenue last year with Nvidia’s AI products in high demand. As for the main breadwinner, Gaming, given the ongoing shortages that have overshadowed the “roll-out” of the Ampere based RTX 30 line of gaming GPUs, an update here will also be useful. “While the ramp of this product line has seemingly been very strong,” the 5-star analyst expounded, “we look for the company to provide an update on sustainability of demand, supply trends, as well as any risk of crypto overhang (note increased risk language around crypto in recent quarterly filings/transcripts).” With an “inflection” in revenue growth anticipated this year, Seymore expects more color on the trajectory of the Automotive pipeline – last valued by Nvidia at around $8 billion – with the company having already announced two “significant software revenue-share wins.” One is with Mercedes Benz (launch expected in 2024+) and the other with Jaguar Land Rover (launch 2025+). So, looking pretty good for a sentiment boosting event, right? Maybe, but in the current environment, Seymore is keeping a lid on expectations. “Despite the likelihood of a positively-toned analyst meeting, we expect the meeting to have relatively little impact on the stock itself, as NVDA's shares are more likely to be influenced by market dynamics in the near term (macro/geopolitical volatility lowering/raising investor risk appetite) rather than its own fundamentals,” the analyst summed up. NVDA shares have had an uncharacteristically bad start to the year, with Seymore admitting the valuation is starting to “look more appealing.” However, fears the sector has reached a cycle peak, along the market's current ""risk-off"" appetite, result in Seymore reiterating a Hold rating, backed by a $285 price target. Nevertheless, there’s upside of ~10% from current levels. (To watch Seymore’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, most analysts disagree; 3 others join Seymore on the sidelines, but with 17 additional Buys, the stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target currently stands at $352.65, suggesting shares could rise by 44% over the next year.

3/20/2022,"Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO Inc. (NIO) is on a massive expansion drive in 2022. The company is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 earnings results on March 24, 2022, after the market close, and investors eagerly wait to see if the upcoming financial data update justifies bullish ratings on NIO stock. NIO's Record High Deliveries to Lift Q4 Revenue The EV maker remains committed to providing monthly updates on vehicle deliveries. Vehicle deliveries during the fourth quarter amounted to 25,034 vehicles - a new record-high quarterly delivery in the company's history. Fourth-quarter deliveries represented a 44.3% year-over-year increase. Deliveries reached 24,439 vehicles during the third quarter. NIO delivered 91,429 vehicles during the year 2021, a strong deliveries growth rate of 109.1% year-over-year. Fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries were well within management guidance range, well upper range, a sign that the company will likely report revenue within the anticipated range. Revenue should surge as deliveries grow. Revenue Estimates for NIO Show Sequential Decline Back in November, management at NIO provided fourth-quarter revenue guidance for between $1.48 billion and $1.60 billion, representing an increase of 41.2% to 52.2% year-over-year and either a sequential decline of 4.4% or an increase of 3.1% from the previous quarter. Wall Street analysts currently project RMB 9,75 billion ($1.53 billion) revenue for NIO's fourth quarter. Revenue for the third quarter was RMB 9.8 billion. Analyst estimates imply a sequentially softer revenue performance during the fourth quarter, despite higher deliveries. Perhaps market watchers see sequentially lower ""Other"" revenue from charging, battery swaps, and sales of regulatory credits. The company's ""Other"" revenue segment was the fastest-growing after a 118% sequential sales growth to $181.4 million (12% of quarterly revenue) during the third quarter. Analysts expect -$0.14 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, which could show an improvement from the previous year's $1.05 loss per share. Importantly, NIO has beaten analysts' EPS forecasts over the last two consecutive quarters. Key Revenue Drivers for NIO in 2022 Product portfolio growth, geographical expansion, and the global chip supply situation may drive the company's revenue performance in 2022. NIO's vehicle sales accounted for 88% of total revenue during the third quarter of 2021. Since releasing its first EV model in 2016, the EP9, NIO has grown its product portfolio to three current models, the ES8, the ES6, and the EC6. The company unveiled a mid-sized smart EV sedan in December last year, the ET5, which will be available to the Chinese market in September 2022. Investors expect three new model launches this year. Order confirmations for a new flagship model, the ET7 have already started, and deliveries will commence on March 28, 2022. The company unveiled the ET7 in January last year. Unlike its immediate competitor Li Auto (LI), which is a bit reserved about launching new models, NIO is taking an aggressive growth stance. It's launching new models at varying price points to capture a larger diversified driver base. The company will continue to expand its charging and battery swapping network in 2022. It plans to launch sales in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark this year. By 2025, NIO expects to have a presence in over 25 countries and regions worldwide. Product portfolio growth and geographical expansions will unlock new growth potential for NIO this year. Improved chip supplies could boost productivity across the whole EV manufacturing industry globally. The Future Looks More Derisked Until recently, NIO stock was listed only on the New York Stock Exchange. The risk of Chinese stocks being delisted from U.S. exchanges was uniquely significant to it. This is no longer the case. NIO finally listed its shares on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) on March 9, 2022. Hong Kong-listed shares are fully fungible with the American depositary shares (ADSs) listed on the NYSE. Investors have another venue to continue trading in NIO stock if Chinese shares leave American markets. Wall Street's Take Turning to Wall Street, NIO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts based on 10 Buys vs. 2 Holds. At the time of writing, the average NIO stock price target of $51.14 represents 176.4% upside potential over the next 12 months. NIO's future looks brighter as the company increases its production footprint, expands its product portfolio, and widens its geographic reach. More so as the world increasingly embraces electric vehicles as it fights the harsh realities of global climate change. That said, NIO is still a Chinese company that faces unique equity risks not shared with U.S. and European EV stocks. Geopolitical tensions may potentially suppress its valuation for longer. However, shares could rally should there be any breakthroughs on the U.S. and Chinese regulatory impasse regarding outstanding audit-related issues. A listing on the Hong Kong market acts as a hedge should the worst happen. ​To find good ideas for EV stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.

3/20/2022,"The US dollar has rallied significantly against the Japanese yen during the trading week again, and it looks like gravity no longer applies. That being said, the market is one of those situations where we will eventually get some type of significant pullback, which could be quite scary. At this point, the market could offer value, but you need to wait to find signs of stability in order to get involved. That being said, the market is overstretched, so it desperately needs to see some type of value proposition jump back in. The Japanese yen is considered to be a safe currency, so it is interesting that it has sold off so drastically around the world. I think what we are seeing more than anything else at this point in time is going to be a reach for yield. Japan simply does not offer yield at the moment, so it is difficult to get overly excited about its currency. When I look at this chart, I believe that the ¥116 level would be an area where I think there will probably be plenty of buyers in that general vicinity. The market desperately needs to find some type of value in order to be tradable, because right now you simply cannot short this market, and you certainly cannot chase it.

3/20/2022,"The impact of sanctions and the collapse of the Russian ruble after the invasion of Ukraine has some Russian banks turning to the crypto market for a boost. Like the biggest one. That is Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, which just received a license from the central bank to issue digital assets to clients on Thursday. Sberbank said the move would allow Russian firms to mint digital assets and “invest their currently idle funds to generate income.” “We are just starting our work with digital assets, realizing that further development requires adaptation of the current regulatory framework. To do that, we are ready to work closely with the regulator and executive bodies,” Sberbank said in a statement. “Companies will be able to make their first transaction on our blockchain platform one month from now.” In February, the Blockchain platform Atomyze became the first firm to receive a license in Russia to exchange digital assets. Now, Sberbank and the financial ecosystem Lighthouse have also been given the green light to enter the crypto fray. The Central Bank of Russia’s decision to allow Sberbank to issue digital assets is a swift departure from its prewar crypto stance. Russian authorities previously sought to ban cryptocurrencies altogether in 2021, and the central bank went so far as to call them a “threat to financial stability.” For Sberbank, the Central Bank of Russia’s crypto pivot is a welcome prospect. The lender has been attempting to enter the crypto market since late 2020, when CEO Herman Gref said the bank was preparing to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Sbercoin, with help from JPMorgan. Now, with JPMorgan following other top investment banks and asset managers in an exodus from the country, it looks like Sberbank has found its own way into the crypto space. And Sberbank needs it—the bank lost more than 95% of its value on the London Stock Exchange after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24. Investors in Sberbank have been left guessing at what its true value may be when trading resumes, as the Moscow exchange has been shuttered since the war began. Sberbank’s subsidiary based in Austria, though, was completely dissolved after large outflows of cash made its failure likely, the EU’s resolution authority announced on March 1. With banks in Russia struggling, the central bank was forced to step in and provide some much-needed cash after the war began. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) imposed a $10,000 withdrawal limit effective until Sept. 9 in hopes of stabilizing banks after Russians withdrew over 110 billion rubles in just the first day after the war began. The CBR also hiked its key interest rate, similar to the Fed funds rate, to 20% in hopes of spurring bank deposits. Still, banks in Russia are continuing to feel the pain from Western sanctions and their latest move into crypto could be viewed as another worrying sign by some investors.

3/20/2022,"Russia's recent decree essentially legalizing intellectual property theft leaves brands like McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) with no legal recourse if copycat businesses use the brands as their own. Over the past two weeks, Russian officials have stripped away IP rights from U.S. companies doing business in Russia, along with foreign companies from 23 other “unfriendly” territories. As a result, companies like McDonald's and Starbucks that have left Russia to protest its invasion of Ukraine can do little when Russian businesses steal their trademarks. In fact, trademark applications were filed in Russia this week that bore a striking resemblance to marks belonging to Ikea, Instagram (FB), McDonald's, and Starbucks, trademark attorney Josh Gerben noted. These companies can't immediately fight back because challenges for unauthorized use are largely limited to Russian courts, Gerben told Yahoo Finance. Gerben expects Russian lawyers to avoid any appearance of sympathy to Western interests. “The fact is that the courts are going to be stacked against you,” Gerben said. “And the fact is you might not have a willing counsel over there to help you, because they fear for their own safety.” Russia's decision to upend its IP rules — in direct response to sanctions from the West — puts company executives in a tough position. On one hand, companies might protect corporate assets by staying put, at least temporarily. And on the other, businesses could stoke costly moral and political backlash, plus jeopardize worker safety, if they continue doing business in Russia. For its part, McDonald's still has some presence in Russia, as certain franchised stores remain open. Just how much IP is in jeopardy is unclear. This week's trademark applications add to separate violations condoned in Russian court, earlier in March. In one case, a Russian judge denied compensation to a Hasbro (HAS) subsidiary, even though an entrepreneur used its ""Peppa Pig"" and ""Daddy Pig"" trademarks. The judge acknowledged denying the relief because of Western sanctions, Law360 reported. In theory, the World Trade Organization can settle IP disputes between the U.S. and Russia under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, according to Justin Hughes, an intellectual property law professor with Loyola Law School. However, even though the U.S. and Russia both signed onto the treaty, that path isn't likely because the U.S. suspended normal trade relations with Russia. “In the past it would have been possible,” Hughes said. But, he added, “The U.S. has already said the normal rules for our international commercial interaction are over.” Christine Haight Farley, a law professor and co-director of American University Washington College of Law’s Program on Information Justice & Intellectual Property, agrees U.S. companies have no immediate recourse to protect against stolen IP. “At the moment, it would certainly not be a good idea to bring a lawsuit in Russia,” Haight Farley said. “No U.S. corporation is going to win that legal battle in the court.” As for the WTO, she adds, there’s little chance the path can offer U.S. companies immediate relief, because they must rely on the U.S. government to bring disputes before the organization and, right now, the issue is not likely top of mind for government officials. While the recent applications for McDonald’s and Starbucks’ trademarks may be more brazen assaults on U.S. IP than in Russia’s past, Hughes said the assaults are nothing new. “The Russian Federation has been a notorious zone of counterfeiting and piracy for years and years,” he said. “It’s not like they’re suddenly turning their back on IP. They’ve never been good at enforcing it.” He points out Russia’s designation on the Office of the United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) priority watch list in 2021, 2020, and 2019. More recently, on March 11, the U.S. Trade & Patent Office announced it terminated its engagement with Russia’s intellectual property agency, the Federal Service for Intellectual Property, also known as Rospatent. McDonald’s, Facebook, and Starbucks didn’t respond to requests for information on what if any responsive actions they're taking to protect their IP. An Ikea spokesperson said, “We don't want to speculate. It is too soon to talk about any potential consequences of this.” Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

3/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s the end of the U.S. yield curve as we know it and Morgan Stanley strategists feel fine. Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Likely to Make Nuclear Threats If War Drags, U.S. Says Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting to Putin on Ukraine Ukraine Update: Russia Again Shells Western Areas Around Lviv Shock Waves From War in Ukraine Threaten to Swamp Sri Lanka Putin Vows to Rid Russia of ‘Traitors’ While Waging Ukraine War Two-year, five-year and 10-year yields will end 2022 at 2.75%, 2.50%, and 2.40% respectively, with inverted curves across the entire Treasury space, strategists including Guneet Dhingra wrote in a note to clients. Traditionally that’s been a harbinger of a recession, though not this time round, they argue. “We think markets are learning to live with yield curve inversion,” they said, citing the willingness to price restrictive policy rates as well as distortions due to pension demand, QE and an investor flight to quality. “The inversion of the yield curve, on its own, is not sufficient to argue for heightened recession risk in the near term.” As the inflation-fueling fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, investors are closely watching the yield curve for signals on the growth outlook. With Federal Reserve officials projecting raising interest rates as high as 2.8% by the end of 2023, bond traders are growing increasingly concerned that the economy could buckle under the weight of monetary-policy normalization. Markets eventually will accept an inverted curve as a natural consequence of interest-rate policy moving toward restrictive territory faster than balance sheet policy approaches neutral territory, the Morgan Stanley strategists said. They do not see a shallow inversion noticably reducing bank loan growth, citing data from previous curve inversions between two- and 10-year yields since 1969. Still, they see some room for caution in speculative assets. The signal of a restrictive Fed policy embedded in an inverted curve as well as the risk of an earnings recession is likely to weigh on stock markets, they said, even if the curve does not signal an economic recession. “The Fed, the U.S. economy, the U.S. banking system, and investors can live with an inverted term structure,” they said. “Discussions of an impending recession will continue, but we expect confidence in that view to wane over time.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs The 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Morgan Stanley Sees U.S. Curve Inversion Coming But No Recession,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-u-curve-104026513.html

3/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s getting harder to deal in some of the world’s most important commodities as everything from geopolitical turmoil to exchange snafus prompt traders to rush for the exits, rapidly draining liquidity. Most Read from Bloomberg Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting to Putin on Ukraine Putin Likely to Make Nuclear Threats If War Drags, U.S. Says Biden Warned Xi of ‘Consequences’ for Backing Russia in War Ukraine Update: Russia Again Shells Western Areas Around Lviv Shock Waves From War in Ukraine Threaten to Swamp Sri Lanka Prices of materials like crude, gas, wheat and metals have become alarmingly erratic as a gulf emerges between buyers and sellers who are facing big financing strains. Markets have been roiled on fears about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine constraining commodities flows, though in many cases rallies were quickly followed by a drop in prices. The London Metal Exchange’s embarrassing weeklong suspension of nickel trading is an example of a market grinding to a halt after extreme price moves. Liquidity is nonexistent as some dealers try to close positions amid a glitchy reopening of trade in the critical metal. The volatility is particularly difficult to navigate because some moves appear to defy fundamentals, with hedge funds exiting long-term bullish bets just as supply looks the tightest in years. Merchants are finding it harder to snap up any cheap cargoes because of huge margin calls and credit line caps. “Volatility as an asset class is enormous now, and on top of that you have some serious operational issues,” said Ilia Bouchouev, a Pentathlon Investments partner and adjunct professor at New York University. “It’s a vicious loop where volatility forces companies to reduce positions, which means what’s left in the market is forced trading. That in turn contributes to even more volatility.” Metals Mayhem Ructions from the Ukraine war have been compounded by a historic nickel short squeeze. The LME suspended trading as prices surged 250% to a record, canceling almost $4 billion of transactions. That caused uproar among investors who stood to profit from bullish bets prior to last week’s closure -- and snags with the reopening have hardly improved the mood. Many previously bullish investors are now in a long queue of sellers enduring sharp price drops while they wait for buyers. By late Thursday, almost $3.3 billion of nickel was on offer at the limit-down price, but there wasn’t a single bid on the LME’s order book. Just two trades took place that day in the electronic market. The illiquidity is a worry for consumers who use nickel in stainless steel and electric-vehicle batteries. There are signs of contagion as trading in other metals also slumps. That’s bad news for manufacturers and end users as it could leave them exposed to more violent price swings. There are signs of spillover in specialist instruments LME traders use to manage price risks. Three long-standing participants in the options market said it’s become much harder to secure quotes from dealers in recent days and that trading spreads between contracts is increasingly erratic. In aluminum, dealers say scarce liquidity is sparking wild moves in prices between key contracts, such as the cash-to-three-month spread. For that spread, which was at about $17 on Thursday, bids and offers are now frequently hundreds of dollars apart. Traders say the gap is due to electronic bids that were likely placed by algorithmic traders, because in practice the spread shouldn’t reach such extreme levels. But with low liquidity and many specialist traders and hedge funds stepping back, those low-ball orders are often the only ones to appear on the screen. Crude Chaos There are clear signs traders are pulling back. Combined open interest on main crude and refined product contracts have hit the lowest since 2015. Almost 1 billion barrels of contracts were liquidated in a period that saw Brent post 16 consecutive $5-a-barrel intraday swings -- its longest such run ever. “When prices can move $10 per barrel in either direction three times a day, no one can warehouse overnight risk and market makers are disappearing,” Energy Aspects analysts including Amrita Sen said. Clearinghouses have boosted initial margins -- the collateral traders put up to finance their positions. In the case of gasoil, that meant traders had to stump up almost twice as much cash to trade the same amount. Traders said they’re scaling back positions and not holding them for as long due to the volatility. Gas Tumult On one day this month, benchmark European gas traded in a range of 140 euros ($155) a megawatt-hour -- more than the contract costs now. With the swings spooking traders, open interest is near a two-year low. Even before the Ukraine war, Europe’s gas and power markets were extremely turbulent due to concern about a winter supply crunch. Surging costs forced German energy giant Uniper SE to borrow $11 billion to pay down margins calls. German utility Steag GbmH and Norway’s Statkraft AS also had to boost liquidity. Skyrocketing gas prices “require significant cash,” said Alfred Stern, who runs Austrian oil and gas company OMV AG. “So far, we were able to manage that in quite a good way, but it has been significant in the last couple of weeks here, lets say in the three-digit kind of millions that we had to inject.” Crop Trading Chicago wheat volumes soared at the start of the war in Ukraine as prices climbed toward a record, but have this week slumped. In Kansas City wheat -- the type closest to what Russia grows -- open interest hit the lowest since 2015.

3/20/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia's central bank kept its key interest rate at 20% on Friday following last month's massive emergency hike and said it would start buying OFZ government bonds, warning of an imminent spike in inflation and a looming economic contraction. Bank of Russia policymakers held a scheduled rate meeting after more than doubling the key rate to 20% from 9.5% in a one-off action on Feb. 28 to support financial stability and shore up the rouble. The currency had crashed to record lows as Western countries imposed sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who was nominated for a third term by President Vladimir Putin earlier on Friday, said the central bank will start buying OFZs on the market when the Moscow Exchange resumes trading of the bonds on Monday. ""After the situation on financial markets stabilises, we're planning to fully sell this portfolio of bonds to neutralise the impact of this transaction on monetary policy,"" Nabiullina said. Trading of stocks and bonds on the Moscow Exchange has been suspended since Feb. 28. Currency trading has continued, with the rouble hitting an all-time low of 120 against the dollar on March 6, which has already fanned consumer inflation. Presenting the rate decision, which was in line with a consensus forecast of analysts polled by Reuters, Nabiullina said the central bank would give the economy time to adapt to new and difficult conditions. She said the banking system was working ""without any flaws"" after the central bank pumped in liquidity. NEW CHALLENGES In a statement, the central bank said Russia was entering ""a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation"" and that flash indicators suggested a deterioration in conditions that will cause the economy to shrink in the coming quarters. The central bank did not give inflation or economic forecasts for this year, saying it aimed to return inflation to its 4% target in 2024. Economists polled by the central bank last week expected the economy to contract by 8% and inflation to reach 20% in 2022. Annual inflation in Russia accelerated to 12.54% as of March 11, its highest since late 2015, with the weakening rouble sending prices soaring amid unprecedented Western sanctions. Nabiullina said that spike was driven largely by panic-buying of consumer goods, which had now slowed. High inflation dents living standards and has been one of the key concerns among households for years. Higher rates help tame inflation by pushing up lending costs and increasing the appeal of bank deposits. With the next rate-setting meeting due on April 29, the monetary policy outlook remained uncertain and subject to further developments around the situation in Ukraine and Western sanctions, analysts said. Sova Capital's chief economist Artem Zaigrin said the central bank could take the key rate to 25-30% in April-June if risks continue to materialise. VTB Capital analysts said they expected rates to stay unchanged until mid-2022, then be lowered to 16% by year-end. Gazprombank said a first interest rate cut could take place in the second half of 2022.

3/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and Senator Joe Manchin on Friday announced a program to develop lithium batteries in the U.S. as part of a broader strategy to help Appalachia amid a transition away from coal. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Russia Denies Cosmonauts’ Colors Signal Support Russia Says It Used Hypersonic ‘Kinzhal’ Missiles to Attack Biden Warned Xi of ‘Consequences’ for Backing Russia in War Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Talks Are Russia’s ‘Only Chance’ Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting to Putin on Ukraine Lithium-based batteries are critical components of electric vehicles, grid storage and weapons, but the U.S. relies on international markets for the processing of most raw materials, according to the Energy Department. The department is promoting a plan to support a domestic battery supply chain -- from critical minerals mining to manufacturing and recycling. The DOE also announced $5 million in funding for pilot projects for workers in communities where energy and automotive industries once held sway. “American leadership in the global battery supply chain will be based not only on our innovative edge, but also on our skilled workforce of engineers, designers, scientists, and production workers,” Granholm said in a statement. President Joe Biden “has a vision for achieving net zero emissions while creating millions of good paying, union jobs — and DOE’s battery partnerships with labor and industry are key to making that vision a reality.” As part of the initiative, Energy Department officials, representatives of the AFL-CIO and the United Mine Workers of America and executives of Sparkz Inc., a battery manufacturer that is developing a cobalt-free battery technology in Knoxville, Tenn., met Friday at the West Virginia Regional Technology Park in South Charleston, West Virginia. The company said in a statement after the meeting it plans to begin construction in 2022 of a “Gigafactory” in West Virginia to commercialize their zero-cobalt battery that will initially employ 350 workers. Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat and longtime champion of the state’s coal industry, has been a crucial factor in the advancement, or lack of it, of Biden’s economic and climate agenda. The lithium battery announcement and the meeting were among the events during a listening session held by the Biden administration’s Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization to identify projects to help the 13-state Appalachia region. “While I remain concerned about our dependence on China and other foreign countries for key parts of the lithium-ion battery supply chain, engaging our strong and capable workforce to manufacture batteries domestically is a critical step toward reducing our reliance on other countries and ensuring we are able to maintain our energy security,” Manchin said in a statement. “I look forward to seeing this initiative grow, and we will continue to work closely together to ensure we can onshore the rest of the battery supply chain.” On Friday, the administration also announced nearly $215 million in Interior Department funding to clean up abandoned mines in West Virginia, Agriculture Department grants for grid improvements and other projects in coal communities in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky, and Environmental Protection Agency grants to a West Virginia non-profit for job training and environmental cleanup.

The recent outperformance of European assets and a reversal of sharp gains for oil prices “points to a significant relaxation in the market’s assessment of the global implications” of the invasion, strategists Dominic Wilson and Vickie Chang wrote in a note. Assets are now “more vulnerable if progress toward a resolution proves fleeting or if energy supplies are disrupted more severely.” Europe’s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index is close to erasing all of the losses sustained since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, while the S&P 500 is now trading higher than where it closed on the eve of the attack. Under Goldman’s downside scenario, a severe disruption in gas flows from Russia could shave off 2.5 percentage points from European gross domestic product and 0.25 points from U.S. economic output this year. According to the strategists, a deterioration of the conflict could push the S&P 500 to 4,059 index points -- a drop of almost 8% from Thursday’s close. “Our downside case is no longer well reflected in many areas and it is now easier to identify potential hedges than it has been for several weeks,” the strategists said. Adjusting for options volatility, long oil positions stand out, while European assets now screen more favorably too as downside tail hedges, they said. Highlighting the contrast between sanguine markets and risks from the conflict, the U.S yesterday warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin may go as far as threatening to use nuclear weapons if stiff Ukrainian resistance to Russia’s invasion continues. Europe’s Stoxx 600 opened little changed. Barclays Plc strategist Emmanuel Cau agrees with Goldman. “More substantial progress may be needed for the risk-on move to persist,” he wrote in a note to clients. “Even if a truce were to happen soon, it is unclear whether sanctions on Russia will be lifted immediately. So the negative impact on growth and higher inflation will still materialize.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs The 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Goldman Sachs Says Market Now Too Relaxed on Ukraine Risk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-says-market-now-091546354.html
