5/18/2022,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — U.S. authorities on Monday announced the discovery of a major drug smuggling tunnel — running about the length of a six football fields — from Mexico to a warehouse in an industrial area in the U.S. The secret passage from Tijuana to San Diego featured rail and ventilation systems, electricity and reinforced walls, authorities said. It was discovered near San Diego's Otay Mesa border crossing in an area where more than a dozen other sophisticated tunnels have been found in the last two decades. U.S. authorities said it was unknown how long the tunnel had been operating and what amount of drugs, if any, got through undetected. They seized 1,762 pounds (799 kg) of cocaine, 165 pounds (75 kg) of meth and 3.5 pounds (1.6 kg) of heroin in connection with the investigation. Six people, ages 31 to 55, were charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine. All are Southern California residents. The tunnel is in one of the most fortified stretches of the border, illustrating the limitations of border walls. While considered effective against small, crudely built tunnels called “gopher holes,” walls are no match for more sophisticated passages that run deeper underground. The latest passage, discovered Friday, ran one-third of a mile (532 m) to Tijuana. It was 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter and about six stories deep. The type of drugs seized may signal a shift from the multi-ton loads of marijuana that were often found in discoveries before California legalized pot for recreational use in 2019. Hard drugs, such as heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl, are typically smuggled through official border crossings from Mexico because their small size and lack of odor make them difficult to detect. But tunnels give smugglers an advantage of being able to carry huge loads at lightning speed. The tunnel exited the United States in a nondescript warehouse named “Amistad Park” on a street that is busy with large semitrailers during the day but quiet at night. On Monday, armed guards watched over a small shaft with a ladder that descended into the tunnel. After staking out a home that was recently used to stash drugs, officials began making traffic stops of vehicles that had been there or at a warehouse near the border, turning up boxes full of cocaine, according to a federal criminal complaint filed in San Diego. They raided the properties — finding no other drugs at the warehouse, but a tunnel opening carved into the cement floor, federal prosecutors said. Authorities have found about 15 sophisticated tunnels on California’s border with Mexico since 2006. Many tunnels, including the one announced Monday, are in San Diego's Otay Mesa industrial area, where clay-like soil is conducive to digging and warehouses provide cover. The cross-border passages date back to the early 1990s and have been used primarily to smuggle multi-ton loads of marijuana. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said in 2020 that they are generally found in California and Arizona and associated with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. Authorities declined to link the latest tunnel to any specific cartel. They claimed victory despite not knowing how long it had been operating. “There is no more light at the end of this narco-tunnel,” said Randy Grossman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California. “We will take down every subterranean smuggling route we find to keep illicit drugs from reaching our streets and destroying our families and communities.” By federal law, U.S. authorities must fill the U.S. side of tunnels with concrete after they are discovered. ___= Associated Press writer Eugene Johnson in Seattle contributed.",U.S./Associated Press,"Big cross-border tunnel found linking Tijuana, San Diego",https://news.yahoo.com/big-cross-border-tunnel-found-204813227.html
5/18/2022,"Tuesday was the most dramatic primary night so far this election cycle. High-profile battles were fought in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, while voters in Idaho, Kentucky and Oregon also went to the polls. The night’s marquee contest — the GOP Senate primary in Pennsylvania — has yet to be decided, with TV personality Mehmet Oz and businessman David McCormick only a hair’s breadth apart in the early hours of Wednesday. Here are the big winners and losers so far. WINNERS Lt. Gov. John Fetterman Fetterman was the clearest winner of the night — from his hospital bed. Fetterman, 52, suffered a stroke on Friday and had a pacemaker device fitted on Tuesday. The candidate says he did not incur any “cognitive damage” from his stoke. His health drama appears to have had no negative impact on his electoral performance. With almost 90 percent of returns in by midnight, Fetterman had racked up more than twice as many votes as his closest rival, Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.). It was a striking victory for Fetterman, whose unorthodox appeal is underlined by his shaven-headed appearance and fondness for dressing in shorts and hoodies. Fetterman leans toward the more progressive side of the Democratic Party, so his victory gave the left a much-needed boost. He will have to wait to see whom he will face in November, but his margin of victory on Tuesday demonstrates striking enthusiasm for his candidacy among his party’s base. Election denialism Another of the more emphatic results of the night was notched up by state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who became the GOP’s gubernatorial nominee in Pennsylvania. Mastriano has trafficked in false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and came to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, though he has said he did not enter the Capitol itself. After the election, but before the insurrection, Mastriano had pushed for an alternate slate of electors to be appointed by the state legislature in Pennsylvania — a move that would likely have overturned the election result in the state had it been successful. Democrats’ alarm about Mastriano’s beliefs is leavened by their confidence that their nominee, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, can defeat the Republican in November. Still, Mastriano’s victory underlines, one more time, just how the fictions propagated by former President Trump have been mainstreamed among Republican voters. Perhaps that should be no surprise: An Economist/YouGov poll last week indicated that 76 percent of GOP voters believe President Biden was not the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. Progressive Democrats There are some results still to come but Tuesday was shaping up to be a solid night for the left of the Democratic Party. In addition to Fetterman’s victory, an even more left-wing candidate, Summer Lee, was holding onto a lead, albeit a minuscule one, against the more centrist Steve Irwin in a House primary in Pennsylvania’s 12th district. Early returns from the Democratic primary in Oregon’s 5th district — which could still change — showed progressive favorite Jamie McLeod-Skinner pulling ahead of incumbent Rep. Kurt Schrader. If McLeod-Skinner pulls off the victory, it will be cause for jubilation on the left — and embarrassment at the White House. President Biden endorsed Schrader. Sen. Thom Tillis and GOP House leadership Controversial Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) was defeated in his primary by state Sen. Chuck Edwards (R), despite having been endorsed by Trump. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) had supported Edwards, a remarkable and risky intervention that ultimately paid off. There won’t be too many tears shed among GOP leaders in Washington over Cawthorn’s loss either. Cawthorn was a headache for GOP leadership, sparking furors ranging from the emergence of photos of him dressed in women’s lingerie to his assertion that he had been invited to orgies. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said after the latter controversy that he had told the freshman congressman he had “lost my trust.” MIXED Former President Trump Tuesday was a mixed night at best for Trump. Cawthorn’s defeat was one blow. Another came with the uncertainty in the Pennsylvania Senate primary. Trump backed Oz there. Even if the TV personality prevails in the end, it will be by the skin of his teeth. Trump can point to other, more favorable results. In North Carolina, his pick in the GOP Senate primary, Rep. Ted Budd, won with consummate ease over former Gov. Pat McCrory. Trump left it very late to endorse Mastriano in the Pennsylvania gubernatorial primary— but Mastriano is cut from very Trump-like cloth. Overall, it was a night that saw Trump’s hold on the GOP appear not quite so solid as previously thought. Democratic general election hopes Democrats had hoped that conservative commentator Kathy Barnette’s late surge in the Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary would propel her to victory. Most Democratic insiders believed Barnette, with her history of inflammatory statements and scant political experience, would be the easiest candidate to defeat in November. Instead, they have wound up with either McCormick or Oz, who are likely to be tougher adversaries. On the other hand, Democrats believe Mastriano’s wide victory in the gubernatorial race gives them a real opening there. Losers Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) The 26-year-old congressman’s defeat was one of the biggest headlines of the night. The dynamics behind that defeat have been mentioned above, but it was still a remarkable fall for the pro-Trump provocateur. He can easily find a prominent place in the conservative media firmament if he wants one, post-Congress. But a primary defeat before his first term is out must surely be a bitter pill nevertheless. Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) Just four years ago, Lamb was a rising star in the Democratic Party. In 2018, he won a special election in a Republican-leaning district to become a congressman at the age of just 33. At the time, Lamb’s ideological moderation and military record — he served in the Marine Corps — was perceived to be an ideal recipe to win competitive districts. But the congressman never gained traction in the Senate race this year. Some blamed the fact that he entered the race six months after Fetterman. But it also seemed as if Democratic primary voters simply weren’t buying the conventional centrism that Lamb represents. The Associated Press called the race for Fetterman less than an hour after polls closed — an embarrassing loss for Lamb, given his previously elevated reputation. Kathy Barnette Barnette looked like the woman of the moment in the final stretch of the GOP Pennsylvania Senate primary. Her momentum appeared so pronounced that there were real prospects of a Barnette victory as Tuesday dawned. In the end, she didn’t come particularly close. Clarity Tuesday’s results — and the lack of results in some places — made it tougher than normal to draw clear lessons. Trump’s endorsement mattered some places — but not in others. An ultra-MAGA approach was Mastriano’s ticket to victory — but not enough for Barnette. Ultimately, the night was a reminder that candidates, and the dynamics of each individual race, can matter as much as the big national trends.
