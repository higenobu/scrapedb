1/10/2022,"Warren Buffett might have billions of dollars to his name, but unlike other celebrities and financial gurus, he prefers to live life simply, for the most part. The investing icon practices what he preaches when it comes to financial discipline, saving and paying off debt. Buffett gave an early warning last May about today’s higher prices when he told a livestream audience of over 28 million during Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting that ""substantial inflation"" was already hitting businesses. When one of the world's most successful investors raises concerns about rising prices, it’s probably a good time to apply some well-tested strategies to tighten your belt. Here are nine ways Buffett's frugality can help you save and spend wisely. While most billionaires bulk up on expensive real estate, Buffett originally paid $31,500 for his Omaha, Nebraska, home — that’s about $289,000 in today’s dollars — and he’s lived there for over 60 years. His home is by no means tiny, however. The 6,570-square-foot, five-bedroom house has had plenty of renovations and additions over the decades and is worth about $1 million today. It’s also protected by fences and security cameras and most likely has a good homeowners insurance policy as well. Buffett has no plans to move out, calling the house “the third best investment I ever made,” in a 2010 letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders. Buffett’s one-and-only mortgage was on a vacation home in Laguna Beach, California, that he purchased in 1971, although he certainly had the cash to afford the $150,000-listed seaside property. He told CNBC that he took out the 30-year mortgage loan because “I thought I could probably do better with the money than have it be an all-equity purchase of the house.” He decided to use the extra cash on hand for shares in Berkshire Hathaway — the company that brought him billions. Buffett's point about not locking up capital still resonates. And if you own your home, you have options to free up some of your capital by refinancing quickly at today's historically low rates before they rise this year, as forecasters expect. A switch may save you thousands of dollars a year. While Buffett could simply have a personal chef cook him a gourmet breakfast, he often grabs Mickey D’s on his way to work. He says he doesn’t like to spend more than $3.17 on his morning meal. “When I’m not feeling quite so prosperous, I might go with the $2.61, which is two sausage patties, and then I put them together and pour myself a Coke,” he says in HBO's 2017 documentary Becoming Warren Buffett. He continues: “$3.17 is a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit, but the market’s down this morning, so I’ll pass up the $3.17 and go with the $2.95.” Instead of going out for meals or buying a latte from Starbucks every day, make your own lunches and coffee. And when you buy online, you might be able to get a better deal with some help comparison shopping. Many billionaires and millionaires keep a collection of flashy sports cars and vintage models in their garages, but Buffett allegedly prefers fixed-up automobiles that he can acquire at reduced prices. He upgraded from his 2006 Cadillac DTS to a Cadillac XTS for just $45,000 in 2014. ""The truth is, I only drive about 3,500 miles a year, so I will buy a new car very infrequently,” he told Forbes. Whether you opt for a brand-new car or a slightly used model, emulate Buffett by spending within your limit. That means you won’t want to go for the first loan you spot and should look around for better deals. A good habit is to do a quick check of auto insurance rates every six months. Buffett doesn’t much care for designer suits or the latest iPhone model — he relied on his $20 flip-phone for years before swapping it out for the Apple smartphone in 2020. Buffett avoids unnecessary spending and once said, “Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.” Park your funds in a high-yield savings account or in a diversified investing portfolio so the money can grow over time. Set aside your extra cash for an emergency fund or retirement instead of blowing it all on nonessential purchases. “I’ve never borrowed a significant amount of money in my life. Never. Never will. I’ve got no interest in it,” he told students at Notre Dame in 1991. Although a young Buffett once borrowed 25% of his net wealth to buy shares, he warns investors against repeating the same mistake. Even skilled stock traders will tell you borrowing to invest can be risky. And there’s no real need with investing apps that allow you to start with a small amount of money, like one that lets you invest your ""spare change"". Buffett credits some of his success to his passion for investing. “You have to love something to do well at it,” he says, urging people to take the jobs they love, instead of positions that look good on your resume. Even if you can’t quit your full-time job to focus on the things you truly enjoy, you can certainly find the time for some affordable hobbies. Buffett himself enjoys card games and playing the ukulele. And if you’re looking for a way to boost your income, capitalize on your skills and hobbies and set up your own side hustle. When Buffett’s first child was born, he converted a dresser drawer into a bassinet. For his second, he borrowed a crib. “If you buy things you don’t need, you will soon sell things you need,” the billionaire says. Take a good, hard look at your finances and figure out where you can cut down on. Get yourself a library card and borrow books and movies instead of purchasing them. Or try a budgeting app to monitor your spending habits. While most of us prefer the convenience of a credit card for our everyday purchases, Buffett uses hard cash. He told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in 2019 that he uses cash “98% of the time. If I’m in a restaurant, I’ll always pay cash. It’s just easier.” While the method may sound a bit old school, relying less on your credit card can help prevent spending money you don’t have. Using most of your available credit and falling behind on your monthly payments damages your credit score. If you’re struggling to pay off your credit card debt, you might want to consider bundling it up into a debt consolidation loan with a lower interest rate.

1/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A valuation case that has fueled a near-tripling in the Nasdaq 100 Index is coming under increasing pressure, with surging interest rates threatening to dent equities’ there-is-no-alternative argument. Most Read from Bloomberg Cypriot Scientist Says Deltacron Covid Variant Isn’t Error Cyprus Finds Covid-19 Infections That Combine Delta and Omicron Omicron Study in South Africa Points to End of Acute Pandemic Phase Crypto Diehards Are About to Find Out If It Really Was a Bubble Fed Unites Left and Right in Warning It’s Behind Inflation Curve While the stock-bond valuation picture still leans toward shares from a longer-term historical lens, it is currently being clouded by the biggest weekly run-up in 10-year Treasury yields in a year. Their surge has shrunk the advantage of the tech-heavy index’s earnings yield relative to the benchmark rate to the lowest level in over three years. The differential, a version of a something called the Fed model that is the subject of significant analytic controversy, at least gives a back-of-envelope glimpse into shifting valuations in two markets whose relationship defies easy quantification. Put simply, the more bonds sell off, the higher their payouts become relative to the cash flow generated by big tech companies. This potentially complicates the buy-the-dip reflex that has defined equity markets for more than a decade. “For years, markets have placed exorbitant multiples on growth stocks because ‘there was no alternative.’ Seemingly overnight it is beginning to appear as if there will be ample alternatives by year-end,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “It will be hard to identify at which levels high-growth names will stabilize in an environment where the Fed is raising rates and shrinking its balance sheet. The ‘alternatives’ that are re-emerging provide a greater degree of stability.” Rates on 10-year Treasuries rose as high as 1.8% this week -- levels not seen since last March -- on a bond selloff that kicked into high gear after the release of surprisingly hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting. The surge in yields slammed speculative assets and cash-generating tech giants alike. A basket of nonprofitable tech shares plunged 10% this week, while the Nasdaq 100 dropped 4.5% in its worst week since February. As a result, the Nasdaq 100’s earnings yields -- a measure of profits relative to share prices -- has been whittled down to 0.85 percentage point above the 10-year Treasury rate, the smallest advantage since October 2018. And this has happened quickly. At the beginning of 2021, there were there were 83 companies in the Nasdaq 100 with a higher corporate profit payout than the 10-year Treasury yield, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By Friday, that dwindled to 64 companies. Investor nail-biting over the yield spike is further fueled by the fact that it’s being driven by real rates, not inflation. This means the prospect for an economic acceleration has caused bond traders to push up their rate expectations. While that’s not bad news for all equity investors, it’s an ominous signal for tech stocks, whose promises for faster growth had lured investors during the last decade during a sluggish economic period. While all this has been churning, there are signs that ever-present dip buyers attempted to unsuccessfully catch the falling knife. Nearly $18 billion has flooded into equity-focused exchange-traded funds over the past week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet the $208 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (ticker QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, was on track to shed nearly $700 million. The question looming on investor minds is, can tech earnings weather further rate shock should 10-year Treasury yield rise to 2%, as many now predict? While it’s not exact science, a simple math exercise shows profits from Nasdaq 100 firms would need to climb 9% for the benchmark’s price to stay where it is and maintain its current valuation relationship with bonds. That might be a high hurdle to clear. Analysts expect software and Internet companies to report a 5.9% increase in 2022 profits, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. Even still, Ally’s Lindsey Bell isn’t too fussed. The Fed’s hiking cycle, while perhaps kicking off more quickly than previously thought, is only expected to take the federal funds rate to 1.75% by 2025. That’s hardly a level that would kill the equity rally or seriously threaten lofty valuations, she said. “Interest rates are still going to be extremely low and they’re not even going to reach the peak of the last cycle when the Fed was raising rates, and we saw that tech, stocks were able to perform well in that environment,” said Bell, Ally’s chief markets and money strategist. “Ultimately once the Fed gets through its cycle, because interest rates aren’t going to go to the moon, I think that stocks are still going to be a good place to be.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek How Jessica Simpson Almost Lost Her Name The Lost Girls of Covid The Former NSA Official Vying to Steer Biden’s Cyber Policy Prescription Weight Loss Drugs Are Working, If You Can Get One Wall Street Loves China More Than Ever ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Surging Bond Rates Threaten to Muzzle Dip-Buying Stock Bulls,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surging-bond-rates-threaten-muzzle-125240277.html

1/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp. I, a special purpose acquisition company led by Chamath Palihapitiya, is in talks to merge with Akili Interactive, a startup that specializes in technology-based cognitive therapies, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

It’s possible terms change or that a deal is not ultimately reached. Representatives for the Social Capital Suvretta SPAC and Akili didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Akili’s treatments are delivered through “captivating action video-game experiences,” its website shows. A key offering is a digital therapeutic, and the company says studies have shown that it improves measures of attention in children diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, also known as ADHD. Led by Chief Executive Officer Eddie Martucci, Akili’s investors include Baillie Gifford, Temasek Holdings, Shire, Amgen Ventures, Neuberger Berman and Jazz Venture Partners, its website shows. The company was last valued at $410 million after a May funding round, according to PitchBook data. PureTech Health Plc said at the time that it owned about 23.4% of Akili. Akili has said it’s advancing clinical research of other digital treatments that may address impairments in cognitive functioning linked to conditions including autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder and multiple sclerosis. Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp. I, which counts Palihapitiya as its CEO and Kishen Mehta as president, raised $250 million in a June initial public offering. Palihapitiya’s Social Capital and Suvretta Capital Management raised four vehicles with different health-care sector focuses. Its first -- the vehicle in talks with Akili -- is focused on neurology. Another vehicle, Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp. III, is in talks to merge with ProKidney, Bloomberg News earlier reported.
