12/10/2021,"Workers in one Starbucks store, in Buffalo, New York, made history on Thursday by becoming Starbuck’s first unionized workplace. It’s a watershed for the biggest coffee seller in the world, which operates 8,953 stores in the United States — and which has done everything in its power to keep its workers from forming a union. The vote itself was tiny. There were 19 baristas and shift supervisors who voted in favor of unionizing, 8 voted against. But it marked a huge victory, nonetheless. Starbucks had waged a massive anti-union campaign in Buffalo — sending out-of-town managers and even executives into stores to discourage unionizing, closing down some stores, and packing remaining stores with new employees in order to dilute pro-union employees’ voting power.  For years, Starbucks workers have complained about the company’s labor practices, claiming that chronic understaffing has created a chaotic work environment, unpredictable hours, and difficulty in taking sick days. Despite episodic commitments by Starbucks management to change, the complaints have continued. They intensified during the pandemic when overstretched Starbucks employees had to deal with new health risks and safety protocols. The union election marks one of the highest-profile union wins in memory for US restaurant workers, who are among the least unionized in the country and whose pay and benefits are among the lowest in all of corporate America. It’s certain to encourage more unionizing efforts among workers in restaurant chains. What occurred on Thursday at one Starbucks store is part of a much larger pattern — a surge in strikes and labor actions across America. Kellogg’s striking workers are still holding the line and refusing to allow the company to separate employees into tiers (with newer workers getting lower pay and benefits). Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama will get another chance to unionize (the National Labor Relations Board found that Amazon used unfair labor practices in the recent election there). And 3,000 student workers at Columbia University have been on strike for six weeks to demand better pay and health care (on Wednesday, at least 100 members of the Columbia faculty joined them on the picket line). What’s going on? Partly, low-wage workers have more bargaining leverage now than they’ve had in years. As the pandemic recedes (let’s hope it continues to), consumers are spending at a higher rate than they have in over twenty months. To respond to this surge in pent-up demand, employers are seeking workers. At the same time, workers across America are taking a fresh look at their jobs. Record-high “quit” rates and near record low rates of labor-participation suggest that a significant number are asking themselves if they want to go back to their old jobs — and are answering “no.” Part of the “no” is an unwillingness to settle for their former wages and working conditions — especially in big companies (like Starbucks, Amazon, and Kelloggs) whose profits have been sky-high. (Or even in richly-endowed universities like Columbia.) That “no” is also reverberating across America in the form of strikes. Many of these workers were on the front lines in the pandemic, and now feel it’s time for their efforts to be rewarded. At a deeper level, I suspect the pandemic itself has caused many people to reevaluate what they’re doing with their lives and to set different priorities for themselves. For years, many big corporations like Starbucks have sold themselves as “socially-responsible” — offering consumers the soothing reassurance that in buying their products they’re somehow advancing the common good. That was always bullshit. Corporations exist only to make money. Corporate social responsibility is a jejune form of public relations. Starbucks’s aggressively marketed “socially responsible” business model turns out to be no different. When corporations like Starbucks fight their workers’ legal right to form a union, the PR veil is lifted for all to see what’s really going on. Starbucks calls its workers “partners,” but they’re not in fact partners. They don’t share in the firm’s profits. Between January and September of this year, Starbucks’s revenue soared to $20.9bn — compared to $17.3bn in the same period last year. Its president and chief executive officer, Kevin Johnson, made $14,665,575 in total compensation last year and is on the way to getting a far larger package this year. Yet current average hourly pay at Starbucks is $14, or $28,000 a year. It’s all about power — the power of workers to join together to gain the bargaining clout they need for better pay and working conditions, up against corporate power to keep wages so low that shareholders and executives can make even more. The victory at one Starbucks store in Buffalo, New York, is a small step on the long road toward rebalancing such power.

12/10/2021,"A sycamore tree saved from felling by Nottinghamshire rebels who slept beneath it and a Monterey Cypress growing on a Welsh beach that was also protected by people’s passion for trees are among 10 contenders for Britain’s Tree of the Year 2021. Public voting is open for the Woodland Trust’s annual contest which the charity hopes will highlight the lack of legal protection for ancient and much-loved trees in Britain.  Last year’s winner, the Happy Man Tree – a London plane tree on a Hackney street – was felled because of redevelopment despite a public campaign to save it. But two of this year’s contenders have a more felicitous recent history. In Newark, the local council’s extension to a car park threatened four graceful sycamores but residents forced a rethink after spending nights sleeping beneath the trees to protect them. On Scar Rock at Saundersfoot beach, Pembrokeshire, a Monterey Cypress planted in January 1938 and now claimed to be dangerous was given a reprieve for a year after local people hailed it as Saundersfoot’s Eiffel Tower. The community has a year to carry out surgery to make it safe, with one tree expert judging that it could live for another 40 years despite its precipitous position. “Tree of the Year has a serious message,” said Adam Cormack, head of campaigning at the Woodland Trust. “Many of our oldest and most special trees in the UK have no form of legal protection. It’s time that our oldest trees got the same protection as our oldest buildings. Our built heritage and our natural heritage are both important and both worthy of protection. After all, once they’re gone – ancient trees can never be replaced like for like.” It has been a bumper autumn for sweet chestnuts and this could be the year for that species with two monster trees on the shortlist: one at Willesley Park Golf Club, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, with a knotted girth of more than 11 metres, and one at Rydal in the Lake District whose celebrated twisting trunk would have been enjoyed by William Wordsworth. Northern Ireland’s contender is an exceptionally curly parasol beech in Parkanaur Forest Park, County Tyrone, where its knotted branches grow back towards the ground in a glorious tangle. Scottish entries are a wind-sculpted lone hawthorn beside the water at Kipford, Dalbeattie, and a graceful ash tree set within a churchyard beside Ettrick Forest in Selkirk.",News/Environment,Which would you hug?

12/10/2021,"Boris Johnson’s ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, has demanded an explanation after the prime minister was accused of misleading him over the Downing Street flat scandal, with sources suggesting Geidt could resign if the answer does not satisfy him. Pressure is mounting on Geidt, the adviser on ministerial interests, over the investigation he completed in May. It exonerated Johnson of wrongdoing over an undeclared £52,000 donation to the Conservatives to cover the cost of a makeover to the prime minister’s No 11 residence.  Despite Geidt’s report finding that Johnson said “he knew nothing about such payments” until stories in the press emerged in February 2021, the Electoral Commission released bombshell new evidence in a report this week. A WhatsApp message was unearthed sent from Johnson to the donor – Lord Brownlow – in November 2020 asking him to approve more funds for the costly refurbishment. Sources predicted Geidt would not “act hastily” and quit immediately, but would probably consider his position if unconvinced by Downing Street’s explanation that Johnson knew Brownlow was administering the donations but not the source of them himself. No 10 confirmed that officials were liaising with Geidt, who could potentially update his findings. A senior Whitehall source said Geidt was furious on Thursday following the publication of the Electoral Commission report but was now considering No 10’s explanation of what happened. No 10 is likely to have argued that Johnson knew Brownlow was overseeing organisation of funds for the refurbishment but was not aware he was the underlying donor. Johnson’s official spokesman refused to say whether Geidt and the prime minister had spoken personally. The government insiders suggested Geidt’s resignation was a “realistic option” given they said he valued his integrity – both personally and for the office that he holds. Geidt needs Johnson’s permission to formally reopen the case, so is expected to ask him to explain the apparent contradiction – either by seeking a statement from Downing Street, requesting a new interview personally with the prime minister, or asking for new evidence such as the WhatsApp message he seemed unaware of before. He may wish to update the initial report by adding an addendum or footnote, but any such changes would need the signoff of Johnson himself. Geidt’s resignation would be a major embarrassment for Johnson, who has spent months fighting off sleaze allegations. Having only taken up the post in April, Geidt replaced another adviser on ministerial interests who also quit over Johnson’s actions. Alex Allan stood down in November 2020 after the prime minister overrode his findings that the home secretary, Priti Patel, had bullied staff. Even if Geidt is not allowed to reopen his investigation, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, is expected to launch an inquiry into the issue. She assured Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, she would look into the flat-funding scandal and undeclared donation once the Electoral Commission had published its report. Rayner has said Johnson “must now explain why he lied to the British public” and accused him of taking people for fools. Although more than £110,000 was paid on Johnson’s behalf for the refurbishment works, the prime minister later covered the cost himself, meaning Brownlow’s money ended back up in his own hands. The source of the funding used by the prime minister to cover the costs has not been revealed.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s ethics adviser could quit over Downing Street flat scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/boris-johnson-ethics-adviser-could-quit-over-downing-street-flat-scandal-lord-geidt

12/10/2021,"Donald Trump lost Michigan by more than 150,000 votes in the 2020 presidential election. But the state still featured prominently in the false claims of election fraud pushed by Trump and his allies. Two days after the election, Trump addressed the nation and delivered a litany of inaccurate allegations about vote-counting in Michigan. “We were way up in Michigan, won the state, and that got whittled down,” Trump said. Without evidence, Trump accused Michigan poll workers of “duplicating ballots”, producing illegal “batches” of votes at 4am, and tallying “more votes than you had voters”.  On 19 November 2020, the Associated Press reported, Trump “summoned Michigan’s Republican legislative leaders to the White House for an extraordinary meeting” as part of a “GOP push to subvert the democratic process”. Trump also filed lawsuits and personally lobbied two Republican officials in Michigan’s Wayne county to refuse to certify the results. While Trump’s claims lacked factual support, he had plenty of political support from Michigan legislators. On 16 November 2020, 41 Republican members of the Michigan legislature signed a letter to Michigan’s secretary of state demanding “a full, independent audit of the recent election prior to the certification of results” due to “serious allegations ... which cannot and should not be ignored”. The letter regurgitates a laundry list of Trump’s baseless claims, including allegations that election officials “counted ineligible ballots; counted the same batches of ballots multiple times; instructed poll workers to backdate absentee ballots; counted late ballots after illicitly pre-dating them; [and] used false information to process ballots”. On 4 January 2021, 11 Republican members of the Michigan legislature wrote a letter demanding “the United States Congress and federal law enforcement, to the extent of their ability by law, conduct an objective and transparent investigation into credible allegations of misconduct in the 2020 election”. Of course, there were no credible allegations and Trump’s effort to overturn the election result failed. But, at Trump’s urging, his allies in the Michigan legislature introduced dozens of bills to restrict voting in future elections. Several of these bills were sent to the desk of the democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer. She vetoed them all. But Trump’s allies in Michigan have not given up. Members of the state legislature are now seeking to impose several new restrictions on voting through an obscure process that would not be subject to veto by Whitmer. These members are backed by millions in corporate campaign contributions, including from corporations who claim to oppose Republican efforts to restrict voting in Michigan. To sidestep Whitmer’s opposition to voter restriction laws, the conservative activist group Secure MI Vote is proposing a ballot measure to restrict voting. While Michigan already requires an ID to vote, the Secure MI Vote initiative would eliminate the ability of those who can’t present an ID to sign an affidavit. The proposal also restricts how absentee ballots can be sent. Under the initiative, election officials will be prohibited from sending absentee voter applications or ballots to those who did not request them. In Michigan, citizens can introduce an initiative on a ballot if they collect a certain threshold of signatures – at least “8% of votes cast for governor in the last gubernatorial election”. For 2022, “340,047 valid signatures are required” before the proposal can appear on the Michigan ballot. But even if those signatures are collected, the initiative is not likely to appear on any ballot. The state legislature is able to pass the proposed initiative with a simple majority before a public vote occurs. And legislation passed in this fashion is not subject to a veto by the governor. That is the strategy that Secure MI Vote is pursuing. In the last 58 years, only nine initiatives have become law this way. In March, the Michigan GOP chairman, Ron Weiser, said that he planned to take the voting restriction bills that did not become law and collect “the signatures necessary for a legislative initiative so it can become law without Gretchen Whitmer’s signature”. Currently, Weiser is the “primary funder” of the ballot drive. NBC reports that these endeavors can range “from $3m to more than $16m.” Of the 11 legislators who signed the letter to Congress in January 2021 asking for an investigation into election fraud, 10 have also sponsored new voter suppression bills throughout Michigan. Based on data provided by the MI Defend Black Voters Coalition, Popular Information found that these 10 legislators have received $1,375,585 in corporate donations since 2018. Twenty-four of the 41 legislators who called for an independent audit into election fraud in November 2020 have gone on to sponsor new voter suppression bills in Michigan. A Popular Information analysis found that these 24 lawmakers have received $2,199,455 in corporate donations since 2018. Many of the top corporate donors to these legislators have publicly defended voting rights in Michigan and other states. Jim Farley, CEO of Ford, signed a statement in April that opposed “Republican-sponsored election bills that would make it harder to vote”. “Government must support equitable access to the ballot to ensure that all eligible voters can exercise their rights,” the statement said. “Government must avoid actions that reduce participation in elections – particularly among historically disenfranchised communities, persons with disabilities, older adults, racial minorities and low-income voters.” A Popular Information analysis found that Ford donated $64,600 since 2018 to 48 Michigan legislators who have sponsored voter suppression bills after the 2020 election, including $12,000 to legislators who signed letters promoting fraud allegations. Ford declined to say whether it supported the ballot initiative or whether it would continue to contribute to Michigan legislators seeking to restrict voting. But the company sent Popular Information the following statement: When it comes to voting rights, Ford’s position is clear: we believe that equitable access to voting rights for all people is the bedrock of a democratic society … We continue to urge elected officials across the country to work together in a bipartisan way to protect and enhance the right to vote. Our employee Pac makes bipartisan contributions based on a variety of considerations important to customers, our team and our company … Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, also signed the letter opposing voter suppression bills in Michigan and other states. Popular Information found that GM has donated $40,100 since 2018 to 34 legislators who both signed the letters promoting fraud allegations and are now pushing voter suppression bills. GM has donated a total of $83,950 since 2018 to 48 lawmakers who sponsored bills that would make it more difficult to vote in Michigan. When asked about the company’s support, a GM spokesperson pointed to a separate statement that Barra posted in April that “urged state lawmakers across the US to protect and enhance ‘the right for all eligible voters to have their voices included in a fair, free and equitable manner’”. GM did not comment on its donations to Michigan legislators that are backing voter suppression bills. Last week, the MI Defend Black Voters Coalition, a coalition of activist groups working to stop voter suppression, released a pledge that called on corporations in Michigan to “commit to cut off all forms of financial support to legislators supporting voter suppression”. “These businesses have made statements supporting Black Lives Matter or opposing voter suppression,” Jennifer Disla, Defend Black Voters Coalition co-chair, told Michigan Advance. “Yet behind closed doors, those very same corporations are chasing tax breaks and anti-work legislation by contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the elected officials working to suppress the Black vote. Money speaks louder than words.” Judd Legum is the founder and author of Popular Information, an independent newsletter dedicated to accountability journalism, where this post originally appeared ",Opinion/Opinion,Republicans want to win back swing state Michigan by hook or by crook | Judd Legum,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/10/republicans-michigan-voting-rights
12/10/2021,"Ithink most of us feel that we ought to wheel out a special wine at Christmas, or at least splash out a bit more than we normally do. But if you’re more used to spending £5-10 than £10-15, what should it be? The danger is going for something based on its reputation, rather than its quality, and that you may not even enjoy. In that category, I would put barolo and barbaresco (both often too woody and stripped of fruit), saint-émilion (there’s better bordeaux out there, and at a much keener price) and that habitual culprit, big-name champagne, which, despite the much-touted discounts, still costs more than you’d dream of spending on a bottle of wine. This applies even to the discounters, whose top wines are sometimes not significantly cheaper than those at an indie and almost always not as good, while if you’re going to buy more expensive wines at a supermarket, you’re generally better off opting for their own-label bottlings such as the gold medal-winning amarone from Morrisons in today’s pick.  There are exceptions, though. I used to warn against buying châteauneuf-du-pape on the grounds that it wasn’t much better than a decent côtes du rhône, but it’s one of the few wines whose quality has improved while its price has remained reasonably stable. (At £36, the 14.5% Marks & Spencer magnum I mentioned in my gift recommendations last month is a really decent buy.) The same applies to sauternes and chablis – the latter is pretty consistently reliable, even if the price has crept up a quid or two (the Brocard chablis in my pick this week is a good case in point). Nonetheless, it’s worth looking out for special offers such as Waitrose’s current “Fine Wines at £10” selection which I mentioned last week. (In addition to the wines I recommended then, I also like the 14.5% Les Clos du Matin Pouilly-Fumé 2020, which is a great buy at a tenner.) The Co-op also has a good pouilly-fumé, Domaine Les Chaumes 2020 (14.5%) at £13.75. Sauvignon still goes down well, too, and is surprisingly good with smoked salmon. When choosing your Christmas wine, I definitely wouldn’t want you to forget the independents, though. Their strength is that they stock wines such as jurançon sec that the supermarkets regard as too hard to sell, as well as wines in small quantities, such as the fabulous Pasotismo Moristel below) made by a young British couple in Spain. There’s still time to order online, so do include them in your shopping plans. Pasotismo Moristel 76 2020 £17.95 Tanners, paso-primero.com, 13.5%. Gloriously bright and fruity, this unusual Spanish red from a rare grape variety is one of the most joyous wines I’ve tasted this year. Morrisons The Best Amarone 2017 £14 (on offer), 14.5%. There’s something splendidly festive about amarone, and this lush, gold medal-winning example is a bargain. Perfect for the stilton. Jurançon Sec L’Estela 2020 £12.99 Cambridge Wine Merchants, £13.95 Caviste, 13.5%. A really appealing, crisp white, made from the obscure gros manseng, petit manseng and petit courbu, that ticks the box for seafood and salads. Domaines Brocard Chablis 2019 £90 for six Marks & Spencer online (ie, £15 a bottle), 12.5%. Classic chablis made by the ever-reliable Brocard family from organically grown vines. Given an extra year’s ageing, too, so a bit of a bargain. Château Montaiguillon Montagne Saint-Émilion 2017 £19.50 (or £17.50 by the case) Lea & Sandeman, 13.5%. This deliciously supple wine from one of the Saint-Émilion villages is streets better than any you’ll find at a supermarket. Perfect for roast beef. Ulysse Sauternes Bordeaux £18 The Wine Society, 14%. This simply sensational sauternes is, unusually, a blend of three vintages (2014, 2015 and 2016) and described by buyer Tim Sykes as “the best-value wine I have come across in my 10 years as a Wine Society buyer”.

12/10/2021,"I’m sure I’m not the only one who’s faced this difficulty this year. One of my family members, who’s in his 40s, has consistently refused to be vaccinated against Covid and will not be moved from his position. He will not explain his reasons for rejecting the vaccine, whether it is ideological or simply rebellion against the so-called “nanny state”. He has already been (politely but firmly) excluded from one family get-together as a result of his intransigence. We have explained that he is not being rejected personally, but there are concerns within the family about his vulnerability to catching the virus and transmitting the infection to the children and their grandparents.  Before Covid, we used to get together with grandchildren and in-laws for Christmas. Last year we all celebrated separately as Covid made it impossible to gather. None of us dares broach the subject of a family gathering this year, and everyone, except the person in question is too polite and kind to tackle the dilemma head-on. I suspect we’ll just repeat last year’s plan, but it annoys me that this vaccine-refuser has spoiled a family tradition. Does it really matter about a lost Christmas? It does for the older members of the family, who treasure any time with their kids. It is difficult to know what his priority is, although so far it seems to be his own needs. In a sense, what his priority is isn’t really the point here. What’s yours? What’s important to you? You’ve already excluded him from one gathering, why not another? If the rest of you all feel the same, I think the best thing to do is face this head-on and just explain that, because of his stance on vaccination and the fact he doesn’t want to get vaccinated, you’ll have to go ahead without him. If you need some facts and figures, try these from David Spiegelhalter, who is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University and author of The Art of Statistics. He quoted a recent government report that “shows that having the vaccine reduces the risk of someone getting infected by 65-80%, and, if they do happen to catch it, it reduces the risk of passing it on by 35-65%, as they tend to get a milder disease. So, overall, the risk of someone else catching it from them, if they are unvaccinated, is perhaps about eight times the risk compared with if they were vaccinated. Of course the risk is zero if they are absolutely sure they have not got it, but otherwise not being vaccinated is greatly raising the risk for anyone who is vulnerable and close to them.” Spiegelhalter and I wondered if your relative having a lateral flow test before coming, and on arrival, is an option. These tests, he says, “are meant to be very good (90% effective) at picking up people who are infectious.” But there are a few things to think about first. You mention grandchildren but not their ages. If they haven’t been vaccinated, because the government programme doesn’t include them yet, (currently in the UK, only ages 12 and up are offered the vaccine) they too pose a risk, possibly more than your refusenik family member if they are at school, and he doesn’t go out much. Of course, this all depends on whether you actually want your relative to come or not. If you don’t, his refusal of the vaccine is a useful get-out; if you do, you may be able to find a way to minimise the risk of him coming if he takes a test. It strikes me that unless none of you ever goes out, you may be sitting next to someone unvaccinated on the bus, in the GP surgery, in church or in a restaurant. I believe it’s a real shame for a Christmas get-together not to happen at all, just because of this one family member; we’ve all missed out on quite a lot already. So I think the option I’d go for is to do it, but without him. You can’t force him to get vaccinated, but he can’t force you to spend time with him.

12/10/2021,"James Graham specialises in pivotal political moments. This House recreated the parliamentary divisions leading to the Thatcher premiership in 1979, and Ink previewed the electoral significance of Rupert Murdoch’s 1969 takeover of the Sun newspaper. Best of Enemies examines another end-of-decade cusp: the TV debates on the ABC network during the 1968 US presidential nominating conventions, between mutually detesting American essayists: on the New Right, William F Buckley Jr and, on the New Left, Gore Vidal.  In a play inspired by Morgan Neville and Robert Morgan’s 2015 documentary about the encounters, Graham suggests that these ideological antler-locking head-to-heads were influential on multiple levels – popularising bitter, unbridgeable gulfs between conservative and liberal America that still endure; making TV, rather than legislatures, the national debating chamber; and, through ABC’s Buckley-Vidal ratings triumph, creating a US peak-time triopoly – with NBC and CBS – lasting until the protagonist of Ink launched Fox News. At one very enjoyable level, Best of Enemies is – in the line of earlier Graham work and Peter Morgan’s Frost/Nixon – historical karaoke, recreating verbatim choice ideas and insults from the studio duels. The roar of complex thoughts and challenges to orthodoxy is so enthralling that it makes Radio 4’s Today programme sound like CBeebies. But Graham and director Jeremy Herrin (with characteristic pace and clarity) crucially give this media archaeology a contemporary framing. The most striking modernity is casting. Charles Edwards’ Vidal delivers a near-perfect soundalike and acceptable lookalike, while Buckley, who can be seen as the epitome of a privileged white right-winger, is portrayed by the black British actor David Harewood. He exactly captures every aspect – drawl, lolling posture, facial tics – of the Republican’s awkward broadcasting persona, except for one element in the room. As a means of equalising opportunity for actors, there is no reasonable argument against racially fluid casting. But in plays that aim elsewhere for photo-realism – the show’s Andy Warhol, Aretha Franklin and Bobby Kennedy reliably match the archives – audiences are asked to make an adjustment in how they visually read a production. When Buckley and the novelist James Baldwin are on stage together, white racism and African-American pride are simultaneously being represented by actors of colour. Apart from Harewood’s electrifying stage presence, a justification for this pictorial revisionism is that Buckley did experience a form of prejudice and institutional isolation; in a Republican party of entitled white Protestants, he was Roman Catholic. Vidal throws one jibe about the Vatican, but Graham might have made more of how the Democrat’s haughty disdain for his rival came from viewing him as a social and religious inferior and establishment interloper. Each man was, by the standards of the time, in the “wrong” party for his background: a political trend that has continued. As has another. A time-jumping epilogue suggests that the 1968 debates may have made televisual visibility such an asset to candidates that it led to hosts of Have I Got News for You? and the US version of The Apprentice running major democracies. Parts of the second half, set at the Democrat convention in Chicago, may seem over-familiar to viewers of Aaron Sorkin’s film The Trial of the Chicago 7, but Graham proves that he stands with Sorkin as our best dramatic interpreters of the interplay of media and politics.

12/10/2021,"Jürgen Klopp believes it is inevitable that Steven Gerrard will manage Liverpool. The club’s former captain returns to Anfield with Aston Villa on Saturday and Klopp says Gerrard is destined for a future in the home dugout. “Yes, absolutely,” Liverpool’s manager said. “The only thing is when is the right moment for that. I think it will definitely happen and that is good for everybody.”  Klopp is looking forward to Gerrard’s visit with a Villa team who have won three of their four games under their new manager. “Wonderful story; I can imagine how his feelings are,” Klopp said. “Stevie is already an experienced coach and knows how to approach games but probably had no idea how to approach it when he steps in the stadium and dugout. “It’s not easy for a world-class player to become an outstanding manager, but it’s possible and it looks like Stevie has all the skills you need. I’m really happy for him.” Gerrard, who had a spell as a coach in Liverpool’s academy before taking the Rangers job, played down his return. “The noise is for other people to get excited about,” he said. “For me it’s about preparing the team in the best way I can to try and get a positive result for Aston Villa. “Everyone in that stadium will know me well enough to know what I’m about and what I’m going to Anfield for. I’m going back to a club where I spent many years and it brings a smile to my face for a couple of reasons. “One, I’ve got a good relationship with a lot of people at the club. I had a fantastic time there, a really good journey, I’m a local boy. It was the team I supported growing up and I will always support that team. “But at the same time it brings a smile to my face because I’ve got the opportunity to go there and compete against a good team and a good manager and try to win the game.

12/10/2021,"Rome residents have been urged to curtail their use of Christmas wrapping paper as authorities in the Italian capital struggle with the perennial dilemma of waste collection. The city’s new leaders are under pressure to fulfil their promise to clean up the streets by Christmas and, alongside the wrapping paper appeal, are paying rubbish collectors a bonus to head off seasonal absenteeism.  Sabrina Alfonsi, councillor for the environment, told Il Messaggero that the issue of wrapping paper and packaging was “no joke”. “As an administration we have taken all the possible actions to improve [waste] collection and to find new outlets for the rubbish that is produced in Rome,” she said. “Christmas is a particularly complicated period, especially for parcels. The production of waste is growing, when instead it must decrease.” Alfonsi stressed that reducing the use of wrapping paper did not mean giving fewer gifts, but said citizens needed to play their part in helping to keep the city clean. Alfonsi was forced to clarify her comments after they generated some criticism on social media, with some people saying her suggestion was a simplistic way of trying to resolve Rome’s rubbish problems and that a few less Christmas parcels wouldn’t make a difference. “There is no initiative on behalf of the council to reduce Christmas parcels,” she told Ansa. “This is a problem that concerns packaging, which is a problem not only for Rome but the whole of Europe.” She said packaging mostly concerns companies and distribution and that reducing its use was a key component in the city’s overall waste management plan, which included building new waste disposal plants. Rome mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, pledged an “extraordinary clean-up” of the city after winning elections in October, setting a goal of Christmas, “if not sooner”. He said: “We will remove the heaps of rubbish, we will sweep and clean the streets, we will mow the grass and we will clean the drains.” In November, he announced that €40m (£34m) had been earmarked for mission. However, there are few visible signs of the goal so far having much impact, with overflowing bins still a regular sight. In order to combat the issue of absenteeism among workers at the municipal waste collection firm, Ama, during the Christmas and New Year period, some €3m of the funds will be used to pay rubbish collectors a €360 bonus to encourage them to turn up to work. Meanwhile, Ama on Thursday announced its staff would go on strike on Monday, and would only remove waste from Rome’s hospitals.",News/World news,Rome residents told to cut back on Christmas wrapping amid waste crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/rome-residents-told-to-cut-back-on-wrapping-paper-amid-waste-crisis
12/10/2021,"Kanye West and Drake’s live-streamed benefit gig has attracted a great deal of excited pre-publicity. Not merely because of the causes behind it – it aims to free Larry Hoover, a Chicago gang leader who has been in prison since a 1973 murder conviction, and raise money for nonprofit organisations dealing with former convicts and prisoners’ rights – but because it represents the squashing of the long-running and occasionally incomprehensible beef between two of pop’s biggest stars. The prospect of reconciliation between Drake and West notwithstanding, it’s hard not to feel a certain trepidation during the lengthy run-up to the performance, beamed live around the world via the gaming platform Twitch. West is an erratic live performer. He can be fantastic, but things can go desperately awry, often in the form of extempore on-stage lectures. Tonight’s show feels particularly high-stakes: if it goes wrong, what price its objectives and good causes?  But after a lengthy opening performance by a gospel choir – they perform a version of Carl Orff’s O Fortuna with lyrics altered to reflect West’s evangelical faith and a cover of his Ultralight Beam as well as Adele’s seldom-played Easy on Me – it quickly becomes apparent any fears are unfounded. West pummels the audience with one hit after another: Jesus Walks, Gold Digger, Touch the Sky, Stronger, Flashing Lights, N****s in Paris and a ferocious Black Skinhead. The staging manages to be both extravagant and minimal – it’s just West, swathed in clouds of dry-ice, performing on top of a giant white structure that looks like an upturned smoke alarm – and his performance is surprisingly compelling. Clad in an enormous pair of boots that one suspects are of his own design, he stalks the huge stage, bent almost double as he raps. Occasionally, he follows the camera operator around, performing directly into the lens, eyes blazing. It’s an hour-long reminder of how great West can be, of the high standard set by the music so often overshadowed by his erratic behaviour or idiotic transgressions. Even his appeal to ex-wife Kim Kardashian West to take him back is nestled, with relative subtlety, into a new verse on Runaway (“I need you to run right back to me / More specifically, Kimberly.”) His set ends with a version of Drake’s Forever, performed as a duet – “FREE THE MANDEM” reads Drake’s hoodie – the two staring each other down as they perform. When he’s alone on stage, Drake addresses the audience. “I just want to say I appreciate Kanye for having me tonight,” he says, going on to laud his former nemesis for running through “one of the best catalogues in music, period”. Then: “I hope you don’t mind if I do my thing for a bit.” It’s an apparently humble remark that, as it turns out, comes with a hint of “uh-oh” attached. After an opening cover of West’s 24, Drake’s set is almost entirely drawn from his recent album Certified Lover Boy and its preceding EP, Scary Hours 2. He performs Girls Want Girls, Way 2 Sexy, No Friends in the Industry, In the Bible. “I came to do some new shit for y’all tonight,” he exclaims. A risky strategy at the best of times, but riskier still when your new shit is as so-so and more-of-the-same as Drake’s. It’s music trapped in an lucrative holding pattern; he is content to switch on the Auto-Tune and burble away in an injured tone about slights, arguments and sundry other crimes against his person. In fairness, the streaming stats are as nuts as ever – this album bested West’s Donda on Spotify – but tonight, with the contents of West’s patchy recent album tactfully ignored in favour of nailed-on smashes, it feels like a letdown. It also doesn’t help that a lot of the tracks he performs feature appearances from guests who aren’t present – their parts are on the recorded track – so what we get is a man gesticulating while his new album plays in the background. West returns for a final performance of God’s Plan but the most telling moment comes earlier in Drake’s set, when the camera switches to West, in the crowd, beaming with delight. At the raised profile for Hoover’s cause? At the money raised for worthwhile charities? At the squashing of the longstanding beef? At the fact he has emerged from the evening triumphant? It’s hard to tell.",Arts/Music,Kanye West and Drake review – the end of an overcooked beef,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/kanye-west-and-drake-review
12/10/2021,"With the Downing Street Christmas party and flat redecoration controversies reaching crisis level this week, Boris Johnson has once again found himself explicitly accused of lying. Here we look at some of the most egregious examples of the prime minister’s alleged dishonesty.  Last week, reports emerged of a Christmas party held in Downing Street on 18 December 2020, at a time when the country was subject to strict Covid measures. Johnson’s official spokesperson denied that any party had taken place, and the prime minister told the House of Commons that “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. But after a video of his former press secretary, Allegra Stratton, laughing and joking with colleagues about a non-socially distanced wine and cheese party, the prime minister changed tack. He told the Commons he had been “repeatedly assured” there was no party but had now asked the Cabinet secretary, Simon Case, to establish “all the facts”. The ministerial standards adviser, Lord Geidt, said in a report that Johnson had told him he knew nothing about who made payments towards the renovation of his Downing Street flat until immediately before media reports in February 2021. But in a separate report published on Thursday, the Electoral Commission said it had seen evidence that Johnson had sent Lord Brownlow, a peer and party donor, a WhatsApp message in November 2020 “asking him to authorise further, at that stage unspecified, refurbishment works on the residence”, to which he agreed. The watchdog fined the Conservative party over the donation. Downing Street now claims that there was no inconsistency between the Geidt and Electoral Commission reports, as Johnson knew only that Brownlow was organising donations to pay for the refurbishment works, not that Brownlow was himself “the underlying donor”. One of the most enduring lies Johnson put to his name was the claim on the side of the Vote Leave campaign bus that “we send the European Union £350m a week” and the money could be used to “fund our NHS instead”. After journalists, campaigners and economists challenged the claim, the official statistics watchdog put the final nail in the coffin of the now infamous propaganda. In 2016, the UK Statistics Authority said it was “disappointed to note that there continue to be suggestions that the UK contributes £350m to the EU each week, and that this full amount could be spent elsewhere”, the UK’s contribution to the EU is paid after the application of the rebate and this was a “misleading” gross figure. In 2018, Johnson was still standing by the claim; in fact, stating that the claim was “too low”. In 2019, Johnson was accused of lying to the Queen over the advice he gave her on suspending parliament for five weeks. The power to suspend, or prorogue, parliament lies with the Queen, who conventionally acts on the advice of the prime minister. The supreme court ultimately ruled the prorogation unlawful – and Johnson was faced with accusations of lying to the Queen. Asked whether he had lied to the monarch about his reasons for the suspension, he replied: “Absolutely not.” The prime minister was condemned for publishing an article in 2004 as editor of the Spectator in which he blamed Liverpool fans for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. While the article says the event was “undeniably” a tragedy, it adds: “That is no excuse for Liverpool’s failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon.” The Hillsborough inquest jury later concluded: “The jury found nothing to suggest that the behaviour of fans, drunken or otherwise, contributed to the disaster.” In 2012, Johnson apologised and added that he “bitterly regretted” the comments. In 2004 Johnson was fired by the then Tory leader, Michael Howard, from positions as shadow arts minister and party vice-chairman for lying about his extramarital affair with the Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt. When it transpired that tabloid reports, which Johnson had dismissed as an “inverted pyramid of piffle”, were true, he had refused to resign. Once the allegations were confirmed by Wyatt’s mother and Johnson was sacked, he refused to go into any further details of his private life, but added: “It’s difficult and much of what I have heard is very peculiar.” In the late 1980s, Johnson was sacked by the Times newspaper over a front-page article about the discovery of Edward II’s Rose Palace, in which Johnson allegedly invented a quote from his godfather, the historian Sir Colin Lucas. He later said: “The trouble was that somewhere in my copy I managed to attribute to Colin the view that Edward II and Piers Gaveston would have been cavorting together in the Rose Palace.” It turned out that Gaveston had actually been killed 13 years before the palace had been built. A pledge to build 40 hospitals by 2030 was repeated many times by Johnson during the 2019 election campaign. Ministers have since set out more details, revealing that the bulk of the projects involve rebuilding or consolidation, and that only four have been started. The scheme comes with a promised spending package of £3.7bn. However, NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said the real cost of building 40 new hospitals would be more like £20bn.",News/Politics,"Lies, damned lies: the full list of accusations against Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/lies-accusations-boris-johnson-full-list-dishonesty-christmas-party
12/10/2021,"Day by day, the UK’s police service is being hit by scandals that dominate the front pages of every newspaper. Today it is the failure to protect London’s gay community and to stop the serial killer Stephen Port. But that’s part of what is now an awful litany: think about the other terrible police failures of recent times: the missing person inquiry failures; the photos shared by ghoulish police officers of the sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman after they were murdered in north London, officers who have now received prison sentences of two years and nine months respectively ; the serving Metropolitan police officer who kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everard and then the five police officers from four forces now facing disciplinary procedures into social media messages related to that murder. Think of what we now know about failures and the swirl of corruption that infected the investigation into the death of the private investigator Daniel Morgan.  And now this, another egregious betrayal of public trust, the failure – as outlined by the just concluded inquest – to arrest and stop Port who murdered four young men Anthony Walgate, 23, Gabriel Kovari, 22, Daniel Whitworth, 21, and Jack Taylor, 25. Despite the bodies being found outside Port’s flat and a local cemetery, despite the murderer’s use of the same modus operandi. On their own, each of these failures is a tragedy for loved ones and disaster for confidence in policing, but together they also tell a story involving political interference, a stunning lack of effectiveness in pursuing criminal investigations and a failure to accord sufficient priority to cases involving violence against women. Many involved with the Port case, grieving relatives and activists, are today citing homophobia. True, in the Port inquest, the coroner directed the jury that as a matter of law they could not “find that prejudice or homophobia or discrimination on the part of the police made any contribution to the deaths”. But certainly that perception must be addressed. Clues were missed, loved ones neglected. Why, for example, was Port’s third victim Daniel Whitworth’s partner of four years not allowed to see the fake suicide note written by the murderer? Is it conceivable that police would not allow the partner of a straight person to see a suicide note and say whether or not it was written by their loved one? This failure alone left Port to murder again. And what is the reaction of those of us who served and have given so much to these forces? I feel embarrassed when I read about the litany of failures in policing. But in the face of criticism, I also offer a caution. We need to distinguish between the hierarchy of leaders and the ordinary, rank and file officers who are trying their best – and doing their best – with one hand tied behind their backs. I feel for them as a retired officer, but now a civilian, I also feel for the public. The root of many of these failings stems from the macabre dance between police and politicians. Forces have been seen by successive home secretaries and prime minsters as an easy target for cuts. There is no coherent strategy, just expedience. When the inevitable increase in crime occurs, the same politicians and senior officers who pruned to disastrous effect then champion extra police resources. The failure of senior police officers to challenge cuts, to stop the dance, or at least denounce it, does not go unnoticed by the rank and file. These officers are left to pick up the pieces, seeking to keep investigations going with limited resources, skills and knowledge. These deficiencies are not lost on those who try unsuccessfully to report a crime, or face great difficulty doing so. We want policing. What we get is crisis management. More restructuring, the formation of specialist squads – not in itself a disbenefit, but organised so they denude frontline policing. As a local commander it was not unusual to be told you were losing your best officers to central squads overnight. I recall objecting to the continuous cuts in police officers, police staff and police stations and being told by a senior manager that I was not a team player and it had not gone unnoticed at the Yard. I understood, knowing how things work at the Met, that my days as a chief superintendent were numbered. I decided that, hand on heart, I could not deliver effective policing and it was time to go, even though I loved being a police officer. The cuts were far too deep. Then there is the culture of impunity within forces. There are reports indicating that UK police forces have received more than 800 allegations of domestic abuse against officers and staff over the past five years. Additional resources have been given to the investigation of allegations and reviews of previous decisions made by police who were left to investigate other police officers. But my own experience was that sexually predatory officers were protected. I was distraught during my service when an officer who had made sexual advances to another officer was provided with a safe police posting elsewhere, ignoring my expectation – and that of the complainant – that he would be disciplined. I remember the pointless police operations that targeted consenting gay men meeting in deserted parks and how fellow officers who were gay men and lesbians supported their Black and Asian police colleagues, including me. Sadly homophobic slurs were common and were rarely challenged. Racism is also stubborn within the police. A recording of comments by past members of Hampshire police’s elite serious and organised crime unit prompted the chief constable, Olivia Pinkney, to declare that the “catalogue of sexist, racist, homophobic and ableist language and commentary … has rightly shocked us all”. But I am afraid it did not shock me. It was sadly predictable. The surprising thing was the emergence of a recording. Still today, the botched investigation into the Stephen Port murders feels like a new low point, for the victims and for their families. Think of Jack Taylor, the last of Port’s victims, whose sisters launched their own investigation when the Met failed do so. What could be more poignant for us? He had his heart set on being a police officer. This must be a turning point. We need to stop politicians using policing for their own ends and senior officers flitting around like butterflies: restructuring, pruning, acquiescing and leaving behind systems that don’t solve crimes, and don’t help victims. We need a police force that is free from the restraints of sexism, homophobia and racism, so that it better reflects and serves our communities. But first we need to assert that policing is important and both rank and file officers, and the public, deserve much better.

12/10/2021,"The streets of many towns and cities across Myanmar were deserted on Friday as the public held a “silent strike” to protest against the military government, days after a massacre of villagers that has provoked international condemnation. Reports of the killing of 11 villagers, including children, in Sagaing region on Tuesday, were described by the US as “credible and sickening”. A spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) warned of an “alarming escalation of grave human rights abuses in Myanmar”.  The military rounded up villagers, shooting them and then setting them on fire, according to reports by independent local media. A video and photograph that appears to show the burned corpses in Don Taw village have been shared on social media. The OHCHR called for a “firm, unified” international response. It also referred to a recent military attack on a small group of peaceful, unarmed protesters who had gathered in Yangon on 5 December. A military vehicle rammed into the group and opened fire, killing as many as five people, according to local media reports. “These attacks are heinous, completely unacceptable, and disregard common values of humanity. They are also far from isolated,” said Rupert Colville, a spokesperson for the OHCHR. In state-controlled media, the military responded to international criticism by accusing UN officials and others of interfering in Myanmar’s domestic affairs and relying on “distorted news”. It denied reports of the massacre in Don Taw and instead accused “nation-destroying media” of publishing false reports. On Friday, the “silent strike” was observed in many areas of the country, with businesses shut between 10am and 4pm to signal defiance against the junta. In Yangon, normally congested roads were deserted, and lines of shops and businesses shuttered. A prominent protest leader, Min Han Htet, posted images of empty streets on social media, along with the message: “We are one organism”. The prominent activist Thet Swe Win said on social media that, in some towns, soldiers had confiscated the property of businesses that had closed, and that business owners had been forced to show up and arrested. Friday’s protest was reportedly observed across the second city, Mandalay, and in towns across Sagaing region, Bago region, Ayeyarwaddy region, Shan state and Magwe region. Mass protests that spread across Myanmar in the aftermath of the coup were crushed with deadly violence by the military. However, opposition remains widespread and people continue to find new, peaceful ways to defy the junta. An armed resistance consisting of people’s defence forces has also emerged. The military has killed at least 1,323 people since it seized power on 1 February, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that monitors deaths and arrests. A further 7,881 are currently detained.

12/10/2021,"The Christmas tree in Bailiff Bridge is shining a metaphorical light on the West Yorkshire village, having been described as “the worst in the north” after it was decorated only a third of the way up. Council bosses say the issue with sprucing up the spruce is that the natural tree has grown too tall, meaning it is unsafe to decorate the higher sections “as they can’t be reached by any maintenance vehicles,” according to Calderdale council’s cabinet member for public services and communities, Jenny Lynn.  “It’s Elf and Safety gone mad,” said the local Conservative councillor George Robinson. “It is clear that it is the worst Christmas tree in the north. When I saw the tree, my heart went into my stomach, the Christmas spirit left my body – I was just left with a Scrooge-like feeling. The lights go a third of the way up the tree, there are two stray baubles on there, clearly a token gesture: in some ways, you wonder why the council bothered.” Amid a pandemic, local people had hoped the tree would bring some festive cheer to the village, but instead it has left them feeling as gloomy as the upper branches when walking past Memorial Park where it is situated. “A Christmas tree is not just a tree,” said Robinson, “it is what it represents, it embodies ambition, excitement, being with family and friends, it is much more than a tree – I think that is the point. Especially after Covid, people want to look at a tree and be excited. “Some people have said we would be better taking our own Christmas tree and plonking it in the park. It would certainly bring more joy to residents than that shambles, which is up there.” There is some positive news for locals, as Calderdale council has promised a superior offering in 2022, allowing the people of Bailiff Bridge to select an alternative tree to decorate in the village. “It is a success story, it is the power of media,” said Robinson. “I think it is important that Calderdale council put this bah humbug attitude behind them so we can move forward, so next year Bailiff Bridge gets the best Christmas tree, the Christmas tree it deserves.”",News/UK news,Yorkshire village’s half-lit Christmas tree labelled ‘worst in the north’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/10/yorkshire-villages-half-lit-christmas-tree-labelled-worst-in-the-north
12/10/2021,"Jurors were not asked to consider if prejudice, homophobia or discrimination contributed to the deaths of Stephen Port’s victims after the Metropolitan police “fought tooth and nail” to keep the hotly disputed issue out of the inquests, despite relatives feeling police had written off their loved ones as “gay druggies”. Though the coroner judge Sarah Munro QC ruled as a matter of law jurors could not consider those issues as possible factors, the charge of “homophobia” was levelled against officers by family and friends as one explanation for the disturbing incompetence seen in all four investigations.

He told the inquests he believed police were guilty of “institutional homophobia”.

I said to police at the time, if it had been a 23-year-old woman found dumped outside a bin, if four young women had been found so close together, there would have been uproar.” Walgate, 23, a fashion student who very occasionally supplemented his student finances through carefully selected escort work, was summed up as a “male prostitute” by one officer, which left Sak “really, really angry”. Another officer believed Kovari, 22, and Jack Taylor, 25, could be drug users because they were “skinny”, the inquest heard. Taylor’s father, Colin, believed because they treated his son as a drug addict “the police didn’t look any further”. A Barking police family liaison officer recorded Port’s first three victims as “all gay and they were using dating websites to meet men and also attending parties that had been organised where it appeared there were drugs actively being used and sexual activity happened”. None of that was true, but it was the false narrative Port had posted under an alias after befriending Kovari’s former partner on Facebook after his death. Officers denied Ricky Waumsley, Whitworth’s live-in partner of four years, access to his supposed “suicide note”. They dismissed him “in every single way”, Waumsley said, “because we were a gay, unmarried couple”. When Whitworth’s father, Adam, and stepmother, Mandy, asked police what the drug GHB was, they were told to “Ask, Ricky, they know about this stuff,” he said. Waumsley had never heard of GHB. By “they”, the officer said under questioning, she meant as Whitworth’s partner, not as a gay man. Postmortem injuries on Whitworth’s body were attributed to possibly being a result of “rough sex”, though there was no forensic basis for such inference. When his body was found in the Barking churchyard where two others were also dumped, the duty inspector described the location in an email as a “haven for gay sex (even dogging) and rough sleepers”, implying Whitworth was there for sex. Sean Wilson, Barking’s deputy borough commander, admitted police failed to proactively engage with the LGBT+ community, but individual Barking officers vehemently denied unconscious bias. The Met’s lawyers, addressing the coroner in the absence of the jury, argued the claim of prejudice should not be an issue left to the jury to decide. The mistakes by individual officers could be explained by “forgetfulness, indolence, lack of training, stress, overwork or inadequate supervision and management”. Lack of resources, and management structure failings, were valid explanations, rather than prejudice. Pape, who was Kovari’s landlord until Port offered the Slovakian student free accommodation at his Barking flat days before he died, said mistakes were made because police “just didn’t value those four young men”. “To my mind, the only thing that makes any sense of how disturbingly incompetent this investigation was is prejudice: conscious and unconscious. And, in my opinion, I think if that means the lives and deaths of young gay and bi men are not treated with significance and respect, I think that amounts to institutional homophobia,” he told jurors. Pape said the inquest had exposed underfunding as a factor, and officers were “overstretched”. “But, consequently, they ‘prioritised’ in ways that exposed their prejudice. It led to incompetence and unequal treatment.” “What disturbs me now, is knowing how the Met actively shut down anything that challenged their incorrect assumption, that the victims willingly took a date rape drug… “They discriminated against Ricky, Daniel’s partner of four years, by not allowing him to see his boyfriend’s supposed suicide note. They didn’t even take a statement from Gabriel’s partner when he was giving them leads on a plate that would have led to Port. They ignored multiple emails from me, with information I had, about older men drugging younger men. “The definition of institutional racism in the Macpherson report states: ‘It can be detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and stereotyping.’ Without acknowledging the core problem as underfunding and prejudice combined, the Met inhibit change and leave open the possibility of this happening again,” Pape said.",News/Law,Police homophobia: the issue Stephen Port jurors couldn’t consider,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/10/police-homophobia-stephen-port-case
12/10/2021,"It is surrounded on all sides, regularly bombed, and plagued by shortages of vital medicines. Yet in the lead-up to Christmas, the isolated Gaza Strip has – for once – ample supplies of something the rest of the world craves but can rarely find: a brand new PlayStation 5. Sony’s flagship video game console is hot property this holiday season, although most people who have asked for one will be sorely disappointed on Christmas morning.  A global supply-chain crisis twinned with a shortage of semiconductors – vital computer chips used in the console – has kept stock scarce. While secondhand, resold and stolen PS5’s can be found, they are rare and often cost much more than the £359-£449 retail price tag. In downtown Gaza City, the price is also way above the official figure. Still, unused PS5s can be seen in a few shop windows. Hassan al-Baik, who runs an electronics outlet, has five consoles but says he has trouble selling them in the impoverished enclave. “There is no great demand for the devices in Gaza because their prices are still high,” he said. Baik says his few customers are mostly gaming cafes, makeshift arcades that cover the steep price by charging Palestinians to play. The first PS5s arrived in Gaza in April as contraband, Baik says. They were sourced in Dubai, taken apart, smuggled in pieces through Egypt and reassembled in Gaza. A handful sold for close to £1,200. However, Baik said Israel has in the past few months allowed suppliers in Gaza to import consoles from Israeli traders – at a premium. The price has since dropped in Gaza to £765-£860, although many linger on shelves. At least three shops have PS5 stock. Adham Masri, a salesman at one store, Mobile Zone, said he sold three to five devices a month. “But demand is limited,” he said. When Sony launched the PS5 just over a year ago, US and UK retailers were overwhelmed by demand, with multiple shopping websites crashing as people rushed to buy one. During the past year, the Japanese entertainment and electronics conglomerate has drip-fed consoles, which normally sell out in seconds. Gamers hoping to buy one spend hours scouring the internet for information – often leaked by shop employees – on where and when the next stock “drop” will appear. Gaza is an unusual location to have PS5 supplies. Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns, have maintained a crippling blockade for years and residents refer to the territory as “the world’s largest prison” because of their inability to travel freely. Israel ofter prevents common items, from cement to batteries to medical equipment, from entering Gaza, claiming they could be used by the military group, Hamas, to build homemade rockets. UN experts say the blockade is a form of collective punishment for the strip’s 2 million residents. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, says 80% of the population depends on international aid. Separately, a World Bank report last month said unemployment reached nearly 50% earlier this year, even before the devastating 11-day war in May. “This the highest unemployment rate in the World Bank database,” it said. Three out of four graduates in Gaza have no employment prospects, the report said. “Despite their severity, these numbers fail to fully portray the degree of suffering of Gaza’s citizens,” the World Bank report said. Still, even the most coveted luxury products will find a way to get into the strip. The PS5’s main competitor product, Microsoft’s Xbox Series X, is also available in Gaza, Baik said, although it, too, finds few buyers. “I got a request recently,” he said of the new Xbox – but only for two consoles.",News/World news,Can’t find a PlayStation 5 console?

12/10/2021,"And on the third day, some hope. The game changed as that 159-run partnership between Joe Root and Dawid Malan stretched on through the afternoon, the miseries for England of the first two innings receded, replaced by the promise of a better contest ahead. Root’s 86 was a vital sign that his duck in the first innings was an aberration, while Malan’s 80 was, in a way, even more important. England won’t win anything if Root doesn’t score runs, but the truth is, they don’t necessarily win much when he does, either. He peeled off a flawless 180 not out against India at Lord’s in August and they were still beaten by 151. Just after tea at the Gabba, Root hit his 1,482nd run of 2021. It is a record for the most runs scored by an Englishman in a single year of Test cricket. On screen they showed the top five in the list. There was Michael Vaughan, of course, in 2002, Jonny Bairstow in 2016, and Root himself, in 2015 and 2016. It’s interesting, flicking through them, to see how well their teammates played around them at the time. In 2002, every member of England’s top six scored at least 500 runs; in 2015, so did Alastair Cook, Ben Stokes, Ian Bell and Moeen Ali; in 2016, Cook, Ali, and Stokes did it again, and so did Alex Hales.  This time around, no one has. In fact, while everyone’s been watching Root close in on one record, his teammates have been threatening another. This year the next-best batsman is Rory Burns, who has scored 492 runs. The last time England’s second-leading run scorer made so few was back in 1999, when England lost to New Zealand at home, and slipped to the bottom of the world rankings. In the long history of English cricket, it’s never happened that their leading batsman has scored more than 1,000 runs while the next best of his teammates has scored fewer than 500. The closest comparison is 1963, when Ken Barrington made 1,015, and Ted Dexter 583. All of which is another way of saying that the man who may be England’s greatest-ever batsman is playing in what is likely England’s weakest-ever batting line-up. They have put on 32 fifty-run partnerships this year, Root has been involved in 20 of them. They’ve put on 10 hundred-run partnerships, and Root has been involved in eight of those. He has scored six centuries, his 24 teammates have managed one. The business of captaincy, selecting teams, switching bowlers, picking out fields, managing people and handling the press is enough of a burden without the back-breaking load of carrying such a deadweight batting unit. The men around him owe him more. Which is why Malan’s innings mattered. It wasn’t perfect, he said himself: “I did get away with it a bit.” There was a miscued pull that landed in front of Marcus Harris at square leg, an edge off Josh Hazlewood that flew over the slips, another off Pat Cummins that fell just short of Alex Carey, and an unsuccessful review for a catch behind which, he said later, he didn’t hit. He was beaten inside and out, played-and-missed almost 20 deliveries. And in among it, he hit some glorious cricket shots, crisp drives, swishy pulls, stylish glances. As the afternoon wore on, it got easier for him, then, as the bowlers changed and he started to cramp, it became harder again. But he persisted. That was what England needed. The irony is when England started planning for this series a year ago, Malan wasn’t part of their thinking. He’s only here because Zak Crawley’s form was so poor the selectors were compelled to look elsewhere. And here he was, a guy who had put together scores of 56, 140, 54, and 62 against these very same bowlers, on these very same grounds, on tour four years previously. England, in the meantime, had apparently decided they were so flush with batting talent they could do without him. The decision to drop him didn’t make that much sense at the time. “It may be that his game is better suited to overseas conditions,” said Ed Smith, who was chair of selectors. Malan, 34, comes across as a little insecure. He has spoken openly about how he was convinced that none of his teammates thought he was good enough to be playing Test cricket even after he scored that century in Perth in December 2017, and you can imagine how Smith’s words compounded that. Now here he was, making the most of his second chance he had long since given up on getting. After stumps he spoke about a moment midway through the afternoon: “I actually said to Rooty when we were both on 40 or 50, or similar scores, and the Barmy Army were singing, I said to him, ‘I’ve really missed this, someone trying to blow my head off, and the adrenaline going playing against the best bowlers’.” Anyone who can go through that and come out laughing and smiling about it has a dash of what England need right now.",Sport/Sport,England’s Dawid Malan provides the run support that Joe Root has missed all year | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/10/cricket-england-dawid-malan-provides-the-support-joe-root-has-missed-all-year
