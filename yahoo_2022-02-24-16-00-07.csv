2/24/2022,"Traffic cameras are great for checking traffic flow, weather conditions and crash sites. On Wednesday morning, one York County camera was also good for catching a pair of men who appear to be stealing a road sign. A state Department of Transportation employee was doing a routine camera check and saw two men taking a sign on Interstate 83 in the area of the southbound Shrewsbury exit ramp, according to safety press officer Fritzi Schreffler. The camera showed two men clearly taking one of two signs from that spot and placing it in the back of a silver pickup.

Catch this deal: Subscribe now The men parked the pickup on the shoulder and opted for the blue “attractions” sign instead of the red “wrong way” sign. The sign alone would cost $600 to replace, but that doesn't include the post or labor to install it, according to PennDOT. Schreffler said the PennDOT employee reported the incident to Pennsylvania State Police, who picked up the men. She said it’s highly unusual to capture something like this. “Usually we get stuff after the fact,” Schreffler said. “We get calls all of the time requesting video of crashes or whatever, but typically our cameras are facing the other way.” Each shift performs a run through all of the cameras to make sure they are working. PSP didn’t have the specifics of the incident when asked late Wednesday morning. After the men left their spot on the shoulder of I-83, they stopped in a lot next to a PennDOT stockpile to further secure the sign, Schreffler said.

2/24/2022,"Former President Trump falsely blamed his ""rigged election"" loss on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. After he brought up his 2020 election lies, Fox News host Laura Ingraham cut the interview short. Trump had a falling out with his once-favorite network after his loss in November 2020. Former President Donald Trump called into Fox News late Wednesday night only to be cut off once he brought up his 2020 election lies. Primetime opinion host Laura Ingraham was asking Trump about ""a lot of weakness in the United States"" and where NATO stands as Russia mounts an invasion of Ukraine, news of which broke shortly before the former president's interview. Trump quickly pivoted to reiterating his lies about voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""I think you're exactly right, I think that's what happened,"" Trump said. ""He was going to be satisfied with a peace, and now he sees the weakness and the incompetence and the stupidity of this administration, and as an American, I'm angry about it, and I'm saddened by it,"" he continued. ""And it all happened because of a rigged election. This would have never happened."" —Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) February 24, 2022 After Trump brought up his ""rigged election"" line, Ingraham ended the interview. ""President Trump, we actually have — just, hold on, I'm so sorry to interrupt you — but have, we're going to the Pentagon, I believe?"" Ingraham said. ""Ukraine, sorry. Ukraine is speaking at the UN."" MSNBC and CNN also carried the remarks from Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's permanent representative to the United Nations. Representatives from Fox News pointed to the network's live coverage from Ukraine when asked for comment. Fox reporters Trey Yingst and Steve Harrigan were on the ground in Ukraine providing live coverage, and Ingraham returned to her previously scheduled interview with newsletter writer Glenn Greenwald after coming back from the floor of the United Nations.
