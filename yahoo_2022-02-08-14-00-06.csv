2/8/2022,"For the past 11 days, hundreds of protestors, many of whom are driving big-rig trucks have occupied Canada’s capital city of Ottawa, blocking streets and disrupting the city with raucous demonstrations. These trucker protests, led by the so-called “Freedom Convoy” now besieging Ottawa, began after the Canadian and U.S. government enacted a rule requiring cross-border truckers to be fully vaccinated in order to get into either of the two countries. The protests, like massive, heavily polarized movements are wont to do, spiraled into a wider, incoherent demonstration against public health measures as a whole. And now, they may be coming to the U.S. More from Rolling Stone RS Recommends: The Best Team Merch for Super Bowl 2022 RS Recommends: The Best Super Bowl TV Deals to Score Right Now The Army Is Finally Giving Anti-Vaxxers the Boot -- Effective 'Immediately' Analysts watching right-wing chatter on apps like Telegram have recently seen an outpouring of organizing around direct actions similar to Canada’s trucker protests, which spread from the Ottawa occupation to large disruptive actions across the country, including at a border crossing to the U.S. in Alberta. In particular, some right wingers seem to be plotting to shut down the Super Bowl this weekend. Trump megafan and Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers took up that mantle yesterday, giving us this particularly bizarre take: Rogers is a fringe figure, deep in the far right, but there are signs that the “trucker protest” model is rapidly catching on with more mainstream conservatives. Here’s Rand Paul, often one of the main gateways of the idiocy exchange between the far right and GOP mainstream: ""Somebody's gotta stand up. Whether it's putting your semi in the middle of a town and honking the horn, or whatever."" — Rand Paul encourages Canadian trucker-style protests against public health regulations pic.twitter.com/hJIQleI5He — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 7, 2022 The sentiment seems to be spreading fast, but it seems doubtful that the right would be able to mobilize anything significant in time for the Super Bowl next weekend, according to Jared Holt, a fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab who studies right-wing movements.  “The desire to provide an American answer to the Canadian protests and cause havoc and headaches is completely there,” Holt told Rolling Stone. “What isn’t, at this point, is a clear plan and call to action.”  Holt noted on Twitter that some of the familiar spokes of right-wing organizing are already there — media networks are covering the trucker protests favorably, groups are starting to discuss or solicit financing for some form of action, and many of the groups have large numbers of members. But there’s no one narrative or specific action that has taken hold in the way that the right rallied at in Washington, D.C., last Jan. 6, or during Charlottesville’s Unite the Right event.  “If organizers are able to speak over that frenzy with a clear plan to action, there may be a potential to generate a similar event, though I’m skeptical of its ability to capture the same scale it did in Canada,” Holt said. “Maybe most importantly, it’s not totally clear that American truckers are actually ready or willing to do this.” In other words, we’ll have to hope that America’s truckers are more responsible behind the wheel than the ones currently honking their horns in Canada’s capital.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" Freestyle skier Eileen Gu, 18, has gotten a lot of attention going into the Winter Olympics. Today, she advanced to the Big Air finals at her first qualifying competition to a roaring crowd. She was born and raised in San Francisco and decided in 2019 to compete for China, citing her heritage, according to The New York Times. In China, Eileen is known as Gu Ailing and works as a supermodel along with being a champion skier. She also speaks fluent Mandarin. But who are Eileen’s parents, and what does this mean for her U.S. citizenship? Here’s what you need to know. Eileen’s mom, Yan, emigrated from China about 30 years ago and raised Eileen as a single parent, according to the Times. Yan used to be a ski instructor at a resort near Lake Tahoe and usually travels with her daughter. Yan studied biochemistry and molecular biology at Auburn University and molecular genetics at Rockefeller University, per Forbes. She’s also worked in investment banking at companies in New York and California, and has worked as a private investor and expert in China for Fusion Investment. He’s kind of a mystery. The Times mentioned that he’s American and graduated from Harvard, but there’s no public record of him and she doesn’t talk publicly about him. Eileen was raised in San Francisco’s Sea Cliff neighborhood, according to the NYT. She shares a home with her mother and maternal grandmother Feng Guozhen. Her bedroom had a view of the Golden Gate bridge. Her grandmother often co-stars in Eileen's social media posts and short documentaries directed toward Chinese audiences, per the Times. Eileen is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and has visited relatives and friends in Beijing most summers of her life, according to the NYT. On Instagram, she mentions that she was working at a summer camp in Beijing when she heard the news that the Winter Olympics would be held in the city. ""I was ‘coaching’ a small Chinese trampoline summer camp in Beijing when we all gathered in front of the TV to watch the olympic 2022 bid,"" she captions the post. ""Even then, I was resolute to achieve the two equally ambitious goals of 1) competing in the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and 2) spreading the (then-unheard of) sport of freeskiing in china. Having been introduced to the sport growing up in the US, I wanted to encourage Chinese skiers the same way my American role models inspired me. 9 years ago, I pitched the idea of a freeski competition. The result was the first slopestyle competition in china. Ever.""    A post shared by Eileen Gu 🖤🌈🧊🐲 (@eileen_gu_) Eileen has publicly spoken about her choice to compete for China, writing on Instagram that it was an “incredibly tough decision” for her to make. “I am proud of my heritage, and equally proud of my American upbringings,” she wrote. “The opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mom was born, during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love. Through skiing, I hope to unite people, promote common understanding, create communication, and forge friendships between nations. If I can help to inspire one young girl to break a boundary, my wishes will have come true. 🇺🇸 🇨🇳 ❤️”    A post shared by Eileen Gu 🖤🌈🧊🐲 (@eileen_gu_) Probably. Eileen has never publicly confirmed that she gave up her U.S. citizenship, according to ESPN. However, the International Olympic Committee requires athletes to hold passports for the countries they represent, and China does not recognize dual citizenship. Because China does not allow dual citizenship, the government has encouraged the public to report people secretly holding two passports, according to CNN. There are very few exceptions to the ban, and it's unlikely that the government would make an exception for even an Olympic athlete, said Donald Clarke, a professor at the George Washington University Law School specializing in Chinese law.
