2/10/2022,"Boris Johnson has said the Ukraine crisis has entered “the most dangerous moment” on a visit to Nato’s headquarters as Russian forces continue their military buildup on the borders of its southern neighbour. The prime minister said “our intelligence remains grim” but told reporters in Brussels that “I honestly don’t think that a decision has yet been taken” by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to order an invasion.  “This is probably the most dangerous moment. I would say that in the course of the next few days, in what is the biggest security crisis that Europe has faced for decades and we’ve got to get it right,” Johnson said. Military analysts estimate Moscow has massed more than 135,000 troops on the borders of Ukraine, both in Russia and in Belarus – and some now believe nearly all the necessary elements are in place if Putin wanted to attack. Johnson’s concern was echoed by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “This is a dangerous moment for European security. The number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down,” he said. Johnson said the UK and Nato would not intervene militarily if Ukraine was attacked, but repeated that Moscow would face unspecified economic sanctions. A conflict, he added, would be a disaster for both countries, as he called on Putin to de-escalate. “I know that in the Kremlin and across Russia they must be wondering whether it is really sensible to expend the blood of Russian soldiers in a war that I think would be catastrophic,” the prime minister said. “And all I would say is that this is the moment now to think of another way forward.” In response to a question from the BBC, Johnson did indicate the UK may be willing to provide arms to support any Ukrainian insurgency if Russia were to invade, saying: “It’s possible, I don’t want to rule this out.” Ukraine’s army numbers 145,000 personnel, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, but there are up to 400,000 people who have fought in the conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region who Kyiv says may be willing to join an armed resistance. The UK prime minister said he had agreed with the Nato chief “a package of support” to boost Britain’s military contribution to eastern European members of the alliance. Britain would be “doubling the presence” of troops in Estonia, Johnson said, where the UK contributes 900 troops to a Nato battlegroup it leads. The RAF, he said, would help provide “air policing in Romania, increasing the number of Typhoons we are deploying out of Cyprus” and the UK will send a T45 destroyer and the offshore patrol ship HMS Trent to the eastern Mediterranean. Stoltenberg said further discussions about increasing Nato’s defensive presence in eastern Europe were ongoing, including on the establishment of Nato battlegroups “in the Black Sea region, in Romania” in addition to those stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.",News/World news,Boris Johnson says Ukraine crisis has entered ‘most dangerous moment’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/boris-johnson-ukraine-crisis-most-dangerous-moment
2/10/2022,"Today in a nutshell: Nathan Chen and Chloe Kim had a golden day for the US, but the delay in presenting medals in the team figure skating event continues to tarnish the Beijing Games Next up: The US face the hosts in the men’s ice hockey, Great Britain’s women seek to get their curling campaign back on track, and tomorrow Ester Ledecká goes for a double-double  Nathan Chen, the world’s most dominant skater, roared to the Olympic men’s title, winning for the US by more than 22 points after a mesmerising long programme that included five quadruple jumps and a pair of triples. He had arrived in Pyeongchang in 2018 as joint-favourite, then had a torrid time on the ice, eventually finishing fifth. Chen has gently pushed back on the redemption narrative throughout the run-up to Beijing, preferring to frame his journey in terms of personal fulfilment. Japanese rivals Yuma Kagiyama and Shoma Uno took silver and bronze, respectively. The figure skating remains mired in controversy. The medal ceremony for the team event has still not taken place amid a legal wrangle. The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are competing in Beijing under that banner due to Wada sanctions for state-sponsored doping that were halved by the court of arbitration for sport in December 2020. Their figure skating team were originally placed first. The US finished second, Japan third, Canada fourth. The IOC has refused to comment on whether the athlete at the centre of a doping controversy at Beijing 2022 is 15-year-old Russian figure skater, Kamila Valieva, despite the teenager being named in multiple reports around the world. Sean Ingle has more for us directly from Beijing. Finland took silver and bronze in the women’s 10km cross-country skiing classic race with Kerttu Niskanen second and Krista Pärmäkoski in third. Convicted doper Therese Johaug of Norway won the first gold of these Games, and she took a second in this event by just 0.4 seconds. American snowboarder Chloe Kim has become the first woman to successfully defend the Olympic halfpipe title. She set the bar with a huge first run, which included two 1080s and three spins. She fell on her subsequent runs while trying to debut the 1260 – three and a half revolutions in the air – but her opening foray was more than enough to secure the gold over Queralt Castellet of Spain and Sena Tomita of Japan. Austrian skier Johannes Strolz won the Olympic gold medal in the Alpine combined race, following in the ski-tracks of his father. The first father-son duo to clinch Olympic gold in the same Alpine skiing event, Strolz said: “It’s really a great moment for me and I’m so thankful that I finally can live my dream and have this gold medal in my hands like my father did in 1988 in Calgary and, yeah, just a dream come true.” Sweden’s men beat Latvia 3-2 in the men’s ice hockey. Last night’s late match saw Denmark beat Czech Republic 2-1. The US ski team says Mikaela Shiffrin will compete in the super-G after all. Shiffrin failed to finish either the giant slalom or slalom, missing a gate in each within seconds of starting each time, and yesterday hinted that she might not compete any further. Germany continued their traditional luge domination with a one-two in the doubles event, and having complained about the judging the other day, South Korea’s Hwang Dae-heon claimed his country’s first gold of these Games in the men’s 1,500m short track.

2/10/2022,"Early on in this three-act, two-interval, three-hour-long piece, protagonist Jyoti laments that stories like hers don’t get told. This piece goes some way to redressing the balance. Vinay Patel’s An Adventure was first seen at the Bush in London in 2018 and receives its regional premiere here. In the intervening four years, thanks to the efforts of journalists such as Sathnam Sanghera, we’ve begun to have a wider historical lens on the story of British colonialism and its effects on the south Asian subcontinent.  Viewed through the prism of that fuller story, this tale of a couple who meet in post-partition India in 1954, marry and move first to Nairobi then 1970s England, feels richer. It is not doing anything as deliberately ambitious as telling the story of the empire via individual lives, but the context of Britain finally having those conversations is undeniable. The sparkiness of the opening scene in which teenage Jyoti (Saba Shiraz) interviews Rasik (Esh Alladi), one of five prospective husbands, is a delight. It is still the most vivid, lively and funny portrayal of an arranged-marriage first-meet that you will see on a British stage. It is dumbfounding that Shiraz is making her theatre debut here; her wit and confidence in the role is that of a far more experienced actor. The overlong second act does, as it did in the original production, meander. The problem is that Patel traverses a lifetime in the story, travelling over six decades in the lives of Jyoti and Rasik, and while we see the waves in a marriage that goes through choppy waters, simply watching them navigate them is not compelling enough. Director Kash Arshad, who is building an impressive set of credits, could power through the piece a little more yet still draw out the big moments. While Madani Younis’s Bush production landed more heavily on the text, with Patel’s tendency towards big statements writ larger than they are here, Arshad directs with a lighter touch, which means you lose some of the grander emotions. That said, come the moving finale you can’t help but feel vicariously grateful that a woman like Jyoti has had a chance to tell her story.

2/10/2022,"The BBC has pulled a documentary about a cryptocurrency entrepreneur from television schedules at the last minute after the Guardian raised questions about some of its central claims. “The Crypto-Millionaire”, due to be broadcast at 7.30pm on Wednesday night, was to tell the story of Hanad Hassan, a 20-year-old from Birmingham who said he had become incredibly wealthy by trading cryptocurrencies. The programme claimed he had turned a $50 (£37) investment at the start of 2021 into $8m (£5.9m) by the end of the year – suggesting he had made an astonishing investment return of almost 16,000,000% in just nine months.  An accompanying BBC website article entitled “Birmingham’s self-made crypto-millionaire giving back” also displayed Hassan’s £30,000 BMW and his city centre flat, while describing how he “decided he was going to become a millionaire while he was still a teenager”. The documentary, due to be broadcast on BBC One in the West Midlands, followed Hassan as he distributed money to food banks in Birmingham, supposedly funded by a charitable cryptocurrency he set up himself. The Guardian asked the BBC if it was confident in his claimed financial returns and questioned why the programme’s promotional material did not mention that Hassan’s cryptocurrency Orfano was abruptly shut down in October, with many unhappy investors claiming they were left out of pocket as a result. The BBC swiftly said they had withdrawn the show but did not make any further comment on their editorial checks. An accompanying online article, which had featured prominently on the BBC News homepage, was also deleted without explanation shortly after the Guardian raised questions. Hassan has also been approached for comment. The decision to pull the show from BBC One schedules hours before it was due to be broadcast is embarrassing for the corporation, as it was one of the channel’s headline commissions for its new regional television news show We Are England. This new show replaced the long-running Inside Out regional current affairs series, which was cancelled as part of BBC funding cuts in a decision that resulted in many investigative journalists based outside London losing their jobs. Ongoing cuts to BBC budgets and deep job cuts, caused by successive licence fee freezes, have been blamed for recent errors in the corporation’s news output, especially in regional English newsrooms. The BBC has a patchy track record of covering cryptocurrencies and publishing stories about young entrepreneurs making large amounts of money from online trading. In October the corporation infamously promoted the rapidly rising price of a cryptocurrency that used the name of the Netflix show Squid Game, days before its price collapsed in an apparent scam. A BBC Three show about a 20-year-old from Wales who claimed to be making £8,000 a day from online currency trading was also removed from iPlayer in 2020 after the broadcaster accepted it “wasn’t explicit enough about the potential risks involved in Forex Trading”.",News/Media,BBC cryptocurrency documentary pulled from air at last minute,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/10/bbc-cryptocurrency-documentary-pulled-from-air-at-last-minute
2/10/2022,"A woman from north London is taking legal action against her local council to try to block the construction of a 700,000-tonne-a-year rubbish incinerator. Dorothea Hackman, 69, a church warden and head of the Camden civic society, is the claimant in a judicial review challenging the decision to award the £755m contract to replace and extend the electricity from the waste incinerator in Edmonton, one of the country’s poorest areas.  “It’s sort of like buying a bigger digger for these boys,” she said. “I’ve just bought a bigger digger for my two-year-old grandson, he was ecstatic. This is what the Edmonton incinerator reminds me of. They’ve got one that pollutes, and should be replaced, but what it should be replaced with is a state-of-the-art recycling centre.” The Edmonton incinerator, which opened in 1971, is the oldest in the UK, and one of the oldest in Europe. It currently burns about 500,000 tonnes of rubbish a year, but is due to reach the end of its life in 2025. Opponents have fought a rearguard action in an effort to stymie the replacement project since planning permission was granted in 2017. But the board of the North London Waste Authority (NLWA), the publicly owned consortium that runs the incinerator, agreed in December to a contract with Acciona, a Spanish firm, to build the plant. In a pre-action letter to the NLWA, Hackman claims its board, which is made up of representatives from seven local councils, were not given the full facts on which to decide on the contract. A report by the authority misled councillors about the scale of the pollution from the proposed incinerator, Hackman’s letter claims, with the 28,000-tonnes-a-year figure given amounting to a fraction of the 683,000 tonnes implied by the independent carbon screening report on which it was based. Councillors were also misled, according to the letter, on the plant’s readiness for carbon capture and sequestration technology, and by the claim that installing such machinery would “likely make the facility carbon negative”. “On 16 December, the NLWA met in Camden and they were given disinformation,” Hackman said. “They were led to believe that carbon capture could happen, and there is basically no provision for it.” The proportion of the UK’s household waste that goes to landfill has plummeted since the beginning of the century. But while Britons now recycle about three times as much, growth in recycling has been flat for a decade. The gap has been filled by incineration. Across the UK last year, 41% of waste was recycled, and 48% was burned; in London, the worst performing region, 64% was burned. “We [in London] are currently recycling less than 30%,” Hackman, a retired teacher, who has lived in Camden for 45 years, said. “Areas without incinerators in the UK already recycle 60%, and that can be improved.” Hackman and fellow activists point to research suggesting incineration can cause a range of ill-effects to the health of people living nearby. In December a cross-party group of MPs said incinerator expansion should be halted immediately to protect human health and cut carbon emissions. There are 90 incinerators across the UK, with 50 more planned. Hackman said: “Above all we need to stop manufacturing plastic, we can’t keep on with the plastic; we’ve got to, and we should, stop it. At the moment we are burning plastic for our heat and energy and I can’t think of anything more insane. We would be better off burning coal.” NLWA says the plant “exceeds statutory requirements” and “will be the safest and cleanest in the UK”, while supplying electricity for up to 127,000 homes and heating 50,000. The consortium has pointed to an analysis by Imperial College London researchers, funded by Public Health England, that found no link between exposure to emissions from municipal waste incinerators and infant deaths – an effect cited by opponents. The development also includes £100m of new recycling centres – “London’s largest public investment in recycling facilities for decades”, NLWA says – which are intended to help achieve a recycling rate for the area of 50%. A NLWA spokesperson said it stood by the validity of the decision to enter into the contract with Acciona. “We are entirely satisfied that the decision our members took … was the right one and was properly taken,” the spokesperson said. “This is a world-class infrastructure project that presents the best environmental, technical and economic solution to the treatment of waste in north London.”",News/Environment,London woman takes legal action to block Edmonton incinerator,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/10/london-woman-takes-legal-action-to-block-edmonton-incinerator
2/10/2022,"In 1974, a year before the release of Nasty Gal, the third studio album by funk and fashion trailblazer Betty Davis, the New York Times predicted that her radical, raunchy music would eventually be appreciated, if only people would let themselves catch up with her: “Miss Davis is trying to tell us something real and basic about our irrational needs, and western civilisation puts its highest premiums on conformity and rationality and rarely recognises the Bessies or the Bettys until they’re gone.” Rather than conform, Davis, who has died aged 77, let the landmark discography she recorded in the 1970s speak for her, along with the sultry, futurist stage persona she created in a powerfully tall afro, cosmic leotards, sequinned hot pants and silver thigh-high boots. “I made three albums of hard funk,” Davis said in the 2017 documentary They Say I’m Different. “I put everything there.” And then, for decades, she vanished from the public eye.  That those albums still sound revolutionary in 2022 says as much about the world as it does about Betty Davis, who will be remembered for the doors she opened and for the incandescent mark she made. Davis was the geist of her zeit, a fashion design student and model who worked for Halston, Norma Kamali and Betsey Johnson. She wrote songs for the Commodores that got them signed to Motown; the Chambers Brothers perform a slinky version of her Uptown (to Harlem) at the Harlem Cultural festival of 1969, finally immortalised in the Questlove-directed, Oscar-nominated Summer of Soul. She electrified Miles Davis, with whom she had a brief and reportedly stormy marriage, during which she turned him on to the psychedelic and funk music of her friends Sly and the Family Stone and Jimi Hendrix, pointing the way toward Bitches Brew. She also helped Davis ditch his formal Italian suits in favour of scarves and platform shoes. Meanwhile, Marc Bolan encouraged Betty to record her own music. She recorded with the Pointer Sisters and Sylvester as well as members of the Family Stone and also her own actual family – a band of cousins and friends from North Carolina called Funk House. In a 1970s radio interview, asked to characterise her music, Davis let her answer slowly crackle. “Mmm,” she said. “I’d just say it was raw.” You could try to dredge up some metaphor about that rawness, the feral howl of her voice, how its gritty undertones might have absorbed the smoke of the cigarette factories in her hometowns of Durham and Reidsville, North Carolina, or the steel mills of her teenage years, after her family moved to Pittsburgh. Born Betty Grey Mabry in 1944, Davis was raised on her grandma’s BB King, Elmore James and Jimmy Reed records. Decades later, Davis would call herself a “projector”, not a singer. What Davis projected was liberation. Once in the early 1960s, Davis showed up at Park Place AME Church in a fur coat, miniskirt and fishnet tights. In a phone call on the day of Davis’s passing, Connie Portis, her friend of 65 years, recalled her teenage friend in a local talent show, performing an original Davis had titled Get Ready for Betty. “That was the handwriting on the wall.” Years later, when Portis saw Davis perform on a bill with “either War or Kool and the Gang” in DC, she was shocked by her wildness. But backstage, Portis says, “She was the same Betty. She never drank, never smoked, never did drugs.” Betty autographed publicity photos of herself in sky-high boots and hot pants and mailed them back home to North Carolina, personalising them “to Grandma”. Davis was a projector, too, of unabashed individuality and sexuality in a way that scared her male peers. “I even turned your head around now,” Davis sang in Nasty Gal. More handwriting on the wall, a lipstick scrawl. “You said I love you every way but your way / And my way was too dirty for you now.” In the 1970s, her songs were frequently banned from the radio. Even the NAACP urged a boycott of her work on the grounds that it perpetuated negative stereotypes. For a woman, and especially a Black woman, in the 1970s to sing about desire and sex so openly and unabashedly was outside the realm of the civil rights movement. Although Island Records failed to renew her contract, she had already paved the way for others. Remove Betty Davis from the strand and you can picture the fallen pearls scattering around the room: Janelle Monáe, Outkast, Cardi B. Miles Davis said she was Madonna before Madonna, Prince before Prince (who played her song If I’m in Luck I Might Get Picked Up as inspiration for his own band). In the wake of Davis’s death, a quote circulated from a conversation about Davis between musicians Erykah Badu and Joi. As Badu concluded: “We just grains of sand in her Bettyness.” Her Bettyness extends far and wide: King Coffey of influential Texan punk band the Butthole Surfers recalled his adulation for his favourite Betty Davis song, Game Is My Middle Name, calling it “certainly the toughest riff of 1973”. Her influence continued after she retreated from music: over the last 15 years, Light in the Attic has unveiled previously unreleased Davis gems, including another come-on, I Will Take That Ride, in which Davis sang: “Is it true that you want to hi-ho my silver?” (The label will reissue Davis’ final studio album, Crashin’ from Passion, later this year.) After breaking with Island, and following the death of her father, with whom she had an especially close bond, Davis spent a year recording and performing in Japan, before returning to Pittsburgh. I believe Davis will be remembered for this, too – of extending the bravery she exhibited on stage to her backstage self, to work to heal herself and to protect the parts of her self and her life that were her own. “She was very private, but she never stopped writing,” Portis says. “Betty opened up the way for others to be brazen and brash and to say what they wanted to say.” We still have some catching up to do.",Arts/Music,Betty Davis projected her own liberation – and freed up generations in her wake,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/10/betty-davis-projected-her-own-liberation-and-freed-up-generations-in-her-wake

2/10/2022,"Boris Johnson broke lockdown laws, appears to believe rules do not apply to him and is creating an atmosphere of mistrust in politics that threatens the long-term democratic future of the UK, Sir John Major has said. In a fierce and wide-ranging attack, Major said Johnson had regularly sent ministers out to “defend the indefensible”, with the truth seen as “optional”, and was badly tarnishing the UK’s reputation overseas with populist-style “megaphone diplomacy”.  The former Conservative prime minister also issued a barely veiled challenge for Tory MPs to remove Johnson, saying parliament “has a duty” to act in the face of the threats to trust and to institutions. Making a speech in London, Major also condemned Johnson for policies including attempts to limit the right to protest and proposals to criminalise refugees and asylum seekers, calling the latter “punishment without compassion”. Directly linking Johnson to the likes of Donald Trump, Major warned that democracy was a “not a passing fancy” and could only be maintained through public trust and governments upholding common values. “Our democracy is a fragile structure; it is not an impenetrable fortress. It can fall if no one challenges what is wrong, or does not fight for what is right,” he said. In perhaps the most eye-catching section of the speech, Major openly said he believed that Johnson and his team had broken the law with lockdown parties in Downing Street, saying the response to this had left the government looking “distinctly shifty”. “At No 10, the prime minister and officials broke lockdown laws,” Major said. “Brazen excuses were dreamed up. Day after day the public was asked to believe the unbelievable. Ministers were sent out to defend the indefensible – making themselves look gullible or foolish. “No government can function properly if its every word is treated with suspicion … The lack of trust in the elected portion of our democracy cannot be brushed aside. Parliament has a duty to correct this. If it does not, and trust is lost at home, our politics is broken.” In another striking section, Major, prime minister from 1990 to 1997, said Johnson appeared to have contempt for ministerial standards, noting examples such as the PM’s decision to reject a report about the conduct of the home secretary, Priti Patel, and his botched attempt to save Owen Paterson from punishment for illicit lobbying. “It may be possible to find excuses for each of these lapses – and others – but all of them, taken together, tell a different tale,” Major said. “The prime minister and our present government not only challenge the law, but also seem to believe that they – and they alone – need not obey the rules, traditions, conventions – call them what you will – of public life. “The charge that there is one law for the government, and one for everyone else is politically deadly – and it has struck home.” Such actions had a long-term and corrosive effect, Major said, repeatedly citing the need for openness and honesty. “Where governments fall short, candour is the best means of binding up support,” he said. “But that candour must be freely offered – not dragged out under the searchlight of inquiries. If it is not whole-hearted and convincing, the loss of public trust can be swift and unforgiving. “We have seen that playing out in recent weeks. Trust in politics is at a low ebb, eroded by foolish behaviour, leaving a sense of unease about how our politics is being conducted. Too often, ministers have been evasive, and the truth has been optional. “When ministers respond to legitimate questions with pre-prepared soundbites, or half-truths, or misdirection, or wild exaggeration, then respect for government and politics dies a little more. “Misleading replies to questions invite disillusion. Outright lies breed contempt. In our democracy, we are able to speak truth to power. But, if democracy is to be respected, power must also speak truth to the people. And yet, in recent years, they have not been doing so.” In other criticisms, Major condemned what he called the government’s populist-style “megaphone diplomacy” and lack of honesty. “If trust in our word is lost overseas, we may no longer be able to work effectively with friends and partners for mutual benefit – or even security,” he said. “We should be wary. Even a casual glance at overseas comment shows our reputation is being shredded. A nation that loses friends and allies becomes a weaker nation.” On specific criticisms, Major condemned the cut in international aid and attempts to create what he called “a compliant judiciary”. He also criticised proposals to stop disruptive protests, calling this unworkable, and likely to alienate the public, and moves to strip British citizenship from dual nationals, without notice or appeal. On asylum, he called for a rethink on plans to make illicit Channel crossings a crime: “Can it really be a crime to be frightened, homeless, desperate, destitute, fleeing from persecution, or war, or famine, or hardship; and to cross half the world on foot and dangerous waters in an unsafe boat, in the hope of finding a better life?”",News/Politics,John Major says Boris Johnson broke lockdown laws and is creating mistrust,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/10/john-major-says-boris-johnson-broke-lockdown-laws-and-is-creating-mistrust
2/10/2022,"I told my fiancée we were going somewhere where we would drink wine on a gondola so she was a bit surprised when we got on a plane to Portugal and not Italy. I had to explain that I meant the Venice south of Porto – the pretty canal town of Aveiro. The stay there, I informed her, would be half the cost of the real Venice and just as nice – both of which turned out to be true. Aveiro also has pretty, colourful waterfront houses and loads of cafes and seafood restaurants hugging its extensive network of calm, peaceful canals. I risked being dubbed a cheapskate but we both loved it – a great romantic choice for a Valentine break on a budget.Nigel  Forget red roses, picture instead hills swathed in fragrant yellow mimosa. Mandelieu-la-Napoule is overlooked by the Massif du Tanneron, said to be the largest mimosa forest in Europe. More intimate than nearby Cannes, this Côte d’Azur gem nestled under the pine-swathed, extinct volcano San Peyre, also boasts the fairytale, medieval Château Napoule, which stands alongside one of several seductive golden beaches. Mandelieu was our base for a Valentine’s mini-break one February. It coincided with the town’s annual 10-day mimosa festival, a feast both visual and olfactory. Spectacular sunsets over the blush-red rocks of the Esterel massif added to the romantic vibe.Roi  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage - If a stroll by a picturesque lake watching wildfowl against the backdrop of a deep orange sunset is your idea of romantic, a stay in Rutland, England’s smallest historic county, could fit the bill. To celebrate our wedding anniversary just after Valentine’s Day, we stayed near Rutland Water at the Rutland Hall Hotel (doubles from £109 B&B). As well as Rutland Water, we enjoyed exploring the small market town of Oakham nearby. Particularly impressive is the Norman Great Hall of Oakham Castle, included on the town’s heritage trail. Admission is free; it is also available for wedding hire.Sharon Pinner My perfect romantic trip is a Swedish adventure starting in Stockholm. In the day I’ll meander through the city window-shopping, visit the national museum and be inspired by Rembrandt, Renoir and Degas, making sure to stop for cosy fika (coffee and cake) breaks. Then at night I’ll watch the city come alive in moonlight with a romantic stroll in the snow after a candlelit dinner. The next evening I’ll catch the night train up to Luleå close to the Arctic Circle, spending time with my partner in our cabin and getting ready to explore the giant frozen lake on ice skates.Imogen Cappelow Perast, Montenegro, is historic, peaceful and relentlessly romantic. The Unesco-protected, car-free town climbs the hillside from the Bay of Kotor. Opposite, limestone mountains stretch down to the bay. Some Venetian palaces have been transformed into boutique hotels; others linger as crumbling memorials. Jetties radiate giving access, in summer, to sunbathing, swimming and boating. In the late afternoon, day trippers from Kotor depart and calm descends. Candle-topped tables line the waterfront, inviting couples to feast on fresh fish or sip a glass of local Varna wine. Eyes constantly savour the reflecting bay, towering mountains and two small isles, capped with charming chapels.Debbie Rolls We had a wonderful holiday on La Gomera in the Canary Islands one year, getting there by ferry from Tenerife. The lack of direct flights from mainland Europe means the island retains its simplicity and charm. We spent easy days on the beach, swimming and eating fresh rolls filled with local avocados. One memorably romantic night, we dined at La Orquidea in the town of Valle Gran Rey. Sitting on the roof terrace overlooking the sea, we ate lenguado (sole) with the Gomeran speciality mojo sauce, and watched the reddest of sunsets followed by the rising of the full moon over the sea. Utterly unforgettable.Gill White I could have stared into the eyes of Saint Valentine for ever … well, where the eyes would have been, at least. What’s claimed to be his skull is in Rome’s Basilica di Santa Maria in Cosmedin. A short walk along the river later, we were in the stunning Sistine Chapel. In the afternoon, we tried our hands at boating on the lake at beautiful Villa Borghese, and then took in the breathtaking views over the ancient city from the nearby Casina Valadier roof bar: a perfect spot for an evening cocktail. Before returning to our hotel, we had a relaxing night-time visit to the luxury De La Ville spa. Così romantico!Shelly Asquith I love walking with my partner along the beaches of Lyme Bay. On a good day you’ll see the stunning cliffs of the Jurassic coast, deep-blue sea and matching sky. On a wintry one, everything’s shrouded in atmospheric stormy grey. Keep walking from the visitors’ centre – it’s blissfully quiet this time of year. We love fossil-seeking and rockpooling, finding starfish and tiny, translucent shrimps. If you don’t have any luck with dinosaurs, you can alway take home a heart-shaped sea stone! To round off a glorious Valentine’s Day, warm up with a cosy cream tea in a Lyme Regis cafe or wander around the Town Mill craft workshops.Sophie Saint Paul’s Bay in Lindos, Rhodes, is beautiful. I went there with my husband-to-be when we were dating – it was our first holiday together. I’ll never forget swimming close to the mouth of the bay with him and watching a gigantic shoal of fish glide past. It was magical. We go back to Rhodes now as a married couple and always visit Saint Paul’s Bay to relive that wonderful first holiday.Esra Kelham The Unesco city of Potsdam is an easy train ride from Berlin. It’s ideal to explore by bike – in true romantic style, we took a tandem. Cycling through Sanssouci Park there are many fabulous buildings to marvel at, including Sanssouci Palace and the Chinese House. Equally thrilling was Glienicke Bridge, or the Bridge of Spies, as it was known during the cold war era. Prefer warmth? There’s plenty to do inside, including a film museum, the Barberini museum and cosy venues for kaffee und kuchen.Fi",Lifestyle/Travel,‘We’re going to drink wine on a gondola’: Readers’ favourite romantic trips,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/10/were-going-to-drink-wine-on-a-gondola-readers-favourite-romantic-trips
2/10/2022,"For most, finding an apartment with the right balance of square footage, amenities, neighborhood, and monthly rent is akin to a competitive sport. These New Yorkers – who lucked into the housing lottery, moved in decades ago, or inherited – placed on the podium and are staying put.  ‘I’m definitely always keeping this apartment’ Growing up on the Upper West Side, Hattie Kolp, like any kid, didn’t think much about the apartment she and her family moved into in 2002, but the roughly 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom has become the center of the 30-year-old’s life as an influencer. She shares photos of the apartment’s details that hint at the building’s 1890 construction – like an original butler’s pantry and ornate fireplaces – with her 90,000 TikTok followers and 52,000 followers on Instagram. “My parents knew this was not their forever home, so they didn’t really care to do any projects,” says Kolp, who assumed the lease from her parents in 2018. “I got really into design, because I suddenly had my own space. It was through that that I really started to appreciate what I had.” The project that made the biggest difference for her was uncovering the original pocket doors – hidden behind walls in her youth – that now tastefully divide the apartment’s procession of rooms. For New Yorkers who are acutely aware of how much a place like this should cost, Kolp’s rent – $1,300 per month – is jaw-dropping. Plus, it’s rent stabilized – meaning it can only increase in rent modestly once a year. There are only 1m such units in New York City. “I don’t know anyone else who’s my age who can afford a two-bedroom apartment, let alone one that’s a pretty good size,” Kolp says. “I’m definitely always keeping this apartment. I truly cannot fathom living anywhere else.” ‘You can’t give up the kind of apartment that I have, where I have it, for the amount of rent that I pay’ It’s that clear-eyed view of the realities of being a renter in New York that have led countless tenants to plant roots in their rarefied digs. Joan Hall has never left the apartment she moved into in 1974 in Westbeth, a West Village building of subsidized artists’ housing. She’s turned the 750-square-foot one-bedroom on the ninth floor with views of the Empire State Building and the New York skyline into a home befitting an artist. Antique oak office furniture, filing cabinets of various shapes and sizes, a collection of antique blue enamel pots, and two 1930s stained glass pieces inherited from her parents give the apartment that lived-in feeling. Hall, who hails from Brooklyn, pays $833.20 per month for what she described as a $5,000 apartment in any other building in the neighborhood. Will she ever leave? “They’ll have to carry me out in a box,” the 82-year-old sculptor says. Rosa Pizarro has lived on a block in the East Village since the 1960s, in a roughly 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom apartment for which she’s paid $700 per month for decades. Pizarro, who is from Puerto Rico, knows she’s lucky and says she was taught by her mother and grandmother to pay it forward. “When people don’t have a place to go, I say ‘Stay with me!’” Pizzaro says. “My friends say, ‘You’re crazy! You give them everything and you sleep on the floor,’ and I say, ‘Well, that’s the way we do it in Puerto Rico!’” Pizarro says even as her neighborhood changes, everyone on her block knows each other. It remains a community. “Now there’s buildings with pools and everything, but of course the rent is different than here. It’s like $5,000,” said Pizarro, who works in elder care. “Where am I gonna get that?” Ruth Sherman, pictured above, still lives in the rent stabilized two-bedroom West Village apartment she and her then-husband moved into in 1974. The New Jersey native raised her two daughters in the apartment but has mostly lived alone for the past 25 years. Her rent was less than $500 a month when they moved in, and she now pays just under $2,000. Sherman’s ninth-floor home is large, with three exposures overlooking the landmarked rooftops of Greenwich Village. The kitchen may be small, but its secondary dining area, two full bathrooms, big bedrooms, and tons of sunlight make up for it. Sherman, who is in her 80s and has been active in the arts throughout her life, said she’s thought of leaving the rental, if only for a change of scene. But she always comes to her senses: “You can’t give up the kind of apartment that I have, where I have it, for the amount of rent that I pay. Where do you go, Ohio? Ohio, I’m sure, is a lovely place, but it’s not New York City.” ‘Oh my God, millionaires live here’ Emily Auffrey did, in fact, move from Ohio to New York. While not the beneficiaries of a rent-stabilized apartment, Auffrey and her family are the recipients of something equally fabled: winning the affordable housing lottery. The building received 93,000 applications for fewer than 1,000 apartments – at the time, the largest turnout ever for a city building’s housing lottery. The housing lottery often gets a bad rep for its use of the word affordable: it offers rent prices at several levels based on income and the area median income, but they are competitively sought out because they are below the market rate of similar units. Auffrey acknowledges the $3,300-a-month rent for the two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment may sound high, but the view of the East River and Manhattan skyline, the 800-square-foot terrace, and her building’s amenities (a gym, children’s playroom, party room, and a landscaped rooftop terrace) would rent for thousands more without her win. The median rent in December for a three-bedroom in Long Island City was $5,800. Auffrey, who works in healthcare, became enamored with the building in 2017 when she was picking up a baby item advertised on a Facebook swap page. “I walked into the building and I was like, ‘Oh my God, millionaires live here.’ It was just so beautiful,” she says. The woman she was picking up from told her the building was part of the affordable housing lottery. The building’s waitlist opened in 2020, when spots were freed by New Yorkers leaving the city because of the pandemic. After a deluge of paperwork, Auffrey, her husband, Matthew, and their son, who’s now four, moved into the seventh-floor apartment in November 2020. Auffrey decorated it with intention. “I wanted to make it dreamy because it was kind of unreal,” Auffrey says. She played up the juxtaposition between the apartment’s view over the steel and glass of the city and her interiors style, which revolves around about 70 houseplants and bohemian touches such as rattan furniture and colorful printed fabrics. Auffrey also celebrates her Black heritage by bringing in bespoke items like pillowcases and indigo modcloth from Black-owned businesses. “We’re never going to move out of this apartment unless we move out in New York City,” Auffrey says. “But we have no plans to move out of New York City.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘They’ll have to carry me out in a box’: inside the apartments of the luckiest renters,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/10/new-york-apartments-photos-rent
2/10/2022,"When the Taliban reached Parveen Tokhi’s home province of Zabul in mid-August and asked to use her school as a temporary barracks, the headteacher was frightened but clear about what she had to do. She spent the bleak years of the first Taliban government in the 1990s stuck at home like almost all Afghan women, barred from education and work. She was determined that the same shadow wouldn’t engulf another generation.  “I said: ‘OK, you can stay there overnight, but these buildings are a girls’ school, and I have sacrificed all my life for the education of these girls.’” The men had to be out in time for morning classes to start as usual at Bibi Khala school the next day, she insisted, undaunted by their guns. Then she got the contact number for senior Taliban officials and rang them directly to say there was no Islamic justification to bar girls from the classrooms and corridors where she had spent most of her life, first as a student, then for four decades as a teacher. “I said: ‘I will not close the school, even if someone kills me for this, because the girls come in hijab, and the teachers are female.’” Southern Zabul province, where Tokhi teaches, is so deeply conservative that even under the previous government only three girls’ high schools operated, all clustered in the provincial capital, Qalat. Girls in rural areas ended their education at sixth grade, if they got one at all. It was not an obvious place for a pioneering experiment in Taliban education policy. But to the surprise of many, in Zabul and beyond, the new Taliban officials agreed to let all girls carry on with their classes after making a few compromises. Girls must now wear “hijab” – by which the Taliban mean the burqa – when they travel to and from school, while the handful of male teachers at the site have been sacked and primary school classes for boys once held on the same site have been moved. “The women came here [to the education department offices] and demanded that they should continue their education, and we decided to allow them,” said Muhammad Usman Huriyat, Zabul’s education director. The Taliban recognise the importance of girls’ education, and want to train more women doctors, he said. “We are all responsible for this. We know about human rights, the need of the people.” The Zabul schools stayed open even after the central Taliban government brought in a de facto ban on high school education for girls last September, blithely shrugging off years of international promises to recognise women’s right under Islam to study and to work. So while the situation in Qalat would be utterly ordinary in most of the world, in the new Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, it was exceptional. The country has 34 provinces, but fewer than a third have allowed any of their girls’ schools to reopen, and even fewer have restarted all secondary classes. Millions of girls are being robbed of their right to an education. “Now I am home all day with nothing to do. I cook or wash clothes, or clean the house. I feel like I am in a prison,” said Arifa, a 15-year-old in Kabul who hoped her excellent grades would be her family’s path out of poverty. “I feel like I am no longer a member of Afghanistan society.” Last spring suicide attackers killed dozens of her classmates, but she still returned to school. She tries to bring that courage and determination to her current agonising wait. “I miss my friends but we have never given up. We want to open the doors of the school again, and we still have hope.” Tracing where girls were allowed back into high schools and why classes resumed – or in a few cases were never stopped at all – may offer insights into how a disparate band of militants can perhaps be nudged on policy. The areas still permitting girls to study – from Zabul in the south to Herat in the west, and Balkh in the north – have differences in wealth, ethnic makeup, popular support for Taliban and past attitudes to women’s education. Some are templates for resistance where activists have taken on the Taliban with protests, strikes or appeals to local leaders, putting their jobs and perhaps their lives on the line. The Taliban are cracking down on women’s rights activists, and there is growing fear over the fate of six campaigners abducted in Kabul last month. In Herat, a powerful speech by a young student demanding her education went viral, while teacher unions threatened mass public protests outside government offices if girls were barred, a senior union official said. Officials relented and schools reopened, though girls were not allowed to take their end-of-year exams. In Zabul, local women’s activists said Tokhi’s outspoken stance helped persuade the Taliban to take an unexpected path, although she has since been demoted. “From the beginning I was very straightforward,” she says, sanguine about the change. “That’s probably why I lost my job. All because of my commitment to the students of Zabul.” Elsewhere, including northern Mazar-e-Sharif city, militants appear to have chosen a different path from the moment they took control, recognising deep-rooted support for educating women. The Taliban director of education for the city even has a wife who teaches at a madrassa. He is proud of her role, even though it may bring contempt from many of the Taliban’s rank-and-file members. “We are trying to have very good education for girls here, and we opened the schools on the second day [after taking the city],” said director Mawlawi Mohammad Naeem as he inspected a school, armed with a pistol and belt of ammunition. “We want to have very nice mothers and sisters in future, so education is vital for that.” Those provinces where girls are still at school offer some hope. But they also serve as a bleak warning of how badly the new Afghan government is damaging the lives of women and girls, even in areas where it is ruling in the most moderate way. Girls who can graduate face futures heavily constrained by the misogyny of Taliban rule, with women restricted largely to work in health and education. “First my dream was to be the president of Afghanistan, but I changed. My hope now is to become a doctor to help our people,” said Narges*, a 12th-grade student in Zabul. The quality of education has also declined in most schools, teachers privately told the Guardian. A ban on male colleagues meant fewer colleagues and that they lost specialists. There is also the constant threat that the classes may be taken away again. “Sometimes I cry, because in Afghanistan we don’t have open-minded people who allow girls to study,” said Zainab*, another high-school student in Zabul who is haunted by the stories of girls barred from classrooms elsewhere. Taliban officials have suggested the five-month-old bar on high-school education for girls is only short-term. The spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC he “hoped” that when boys returned to class in March after the long winter break, girls would be with them. The west has tried to reinforce that promise with a pledge to pay teacher salaries if girls are allowed to study. Another Taliban official said new schools were needed for girls to study in isolation, although students were already segregated by gender. Afghans who remember the last Taliban government are skeptical. In the 1990s, a sweeping bar on all girls’ education was justified as a temporary response to security concerns, but in the five years they ruled, it was never lifted. Many fear that the new ban may also stretch on open-ended. Reopening in places like conservative Zabul makes a mockery of claims that the education system needs significant alterations. What little hope there is may lie in the changes of the last two decades, among the Taliban and all Afghanistan. Many of the senior Taliban leadership now embrace educating their own daughters, and even ordinary fighters are less suspicious of western-style learning. At one private academy, militants who might once have attacked classrooms have instead joined them to study English and computing. A teacher, who asked not to be named, said: “A group of Taliban came in, and I heard them saying: ‘We used to kill students at places like this, now we are studying here.’” Women have changed too. Twenty years of education mean the Taliban have inherited a country radically different to the shattered Afghanistan of their last rule. In 2000, Unicef estimated that only 4-5% of all primary age students went to school in Afghanistan. Today there is a generation of educated young activists ready to fight for the right to continue studying. “We are not going to let them [get away with this],” said Mahbouba Seraj, a prominent women’s rights activist still living in Kabul. “There is nothing, in the Qur’an, or in the Hadith, or as an example in other Islamic countries, that would permit stopping women from going to school.” “When [the Taliban] took power in the 1990s there were no women, or anybody in Afghanistan, who could raise their voice on this issue. But now they cannot do it, because we are after them.” * Some names have been changed",News/World news,‘We have never given up’: how Afghan women are demanding their education under the Taliban,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/we-have-never-given-up-how-afghan-women-are-demanding-their-education-under-the-taliban
2/10/2022,"Michael Cash is a hewer – he descends into the subterranean shafts and tunnels of the Black Country to swing a pickaxe at the seams of coal that run there. If a more perilous occupation exists in England in the 1870s, then it perhaps belongs only to the often-orphaned children who are paid a pittance to drag the wagons that Michael and his colleagues fill, and whipped if they stop to scratch the sores made by the chains that bind them. Here, subterranean stalls propped up by planks can collapse instantly, killing those who made them, and noxious gases permeate. In a good week, Michael earns enough to buy leeks and potatoes with which his new wife can make broth to feed the family, but not enough to pay for his six-year-old son Luke’s schooling. A bony roach or two lifted from a dreary pond supplements their diet. Like so many miners, Michael’s main motivation is preventing his son from having to follow him down into the Dante-esque circles of hell that Daniel Wiles brilliantly evokes in this confident and moving debut.  Sun-starved life above ground in a cruel November isn’t much better. Here, “ossdrawn barges churned up silt from the cut floor as they slithered past … One boat held so many people that some nippers even swam behind it in the dark matter, only visible by the light that hung behind the boat. Dogs swam with them, their eyes reflecting like buoyed beacons.” A change in fortune comes when Michael and his fellow hewer Cain secretly discover a seam of gold, and suddenly we’re in a proto-Klondike world, had the Yukon gold rush been chronicled by a far less florid DH Lawrence. The lump of gold provides one of the few flashes of light in a soot-covered West Midlands that is otherwise defined by poverty and hardship, so it comes as little surprise when the violent Cain double-crosses Michael. He is then forced to travel to Dudley by barge, an epic autumnal journey that feels as weighted with foreboding as Marlow’s in Heart of Darkness. Here we see the Industrial Revolution (and by extension, the British empire) as it really was: merciless and driven entirely by greed and exploitation. Wiles’s writing throughout is as chiselled and pure as the sedimentary rock from which carbonised coal is created, while the equally pared-down Black Country dialect – all compressed consonants and flattened vowels – is poetically minimalist: “Ow bist yow?” men nod to one another. Though the relentless hardship on display initially leans towards steely US writers such as Cormac McCarthy, Ron Rash and Daniel Woodrell, in Michael there’s also a quiet nobility and stoic sense of morality towards those even less fortunate that recalls Claire Keegan’s masterful recent novella Small Things Like These. The unforgiving land itself is a central character. “Mercia gives and teks,” Michael recalls his father saying, using the Anglo-Saxon name for the heartland of England. “All of life’s fates explained by this one simple rule. There is no give without take, and Mercia’s take was always fair.” There are few words wasted here, and only when the book ends do we learn that Mercia has taken more than enough: the novel is inspired by real events and dedicated to 22 men and boys who died in the colliery disaster at Pelsall Hall near Walsall in 1872. A granite obelisk erected in their memory still stands today, though Mercia’s Take is an equally powerful tribute to all those who toiled at the coalfaces across Britain so that an avaricious empire might expand, whatever the cost.

2/10/2022,"Henry Leckenby, 54, recalls a feeling of scarcity when he first started working as a substitute teacher. Each morning, he jumped on the computer first thing to see which assignments were open that day. Now, he has his pick of jobs he wants to take and schools he wants to work in.  “I’ve gotten the impression that every single day I wake up, I have work if I want it. The other day there were literally at least a couple dozen openings,” he said. Leckenby, who lives in La Crosse, Wisconsin, has a PhD in physics, but found it difficult to find work after a university job dried up. “‘Overqualified’ is a word I heard a lot,” he said. But substitute teaching offered a flexible schedule that fit his needs and he’s been doing it ever since. Substitute teachers like Leckenby suddenly find themselves on the winning end of a supply-and-demand problem facing schools across the country: Too few full-time teachers, and not enough substitute teachers to cover for them. As the Omicron variant hurtled across the nation, political leaders from the White House to local school boards faced intense pressure to keep open brick-and-mortar schools – and most have. “Let’s put it in perspective: 95%, as high as 98%, of the schools in America are open, functioning and capable of doing the job,” president Joe Biden said at a press conference last month. He urged school districts to use funding to keep schools open. But that reality has left the nation’s public schools scrambling to fill holes created by a lack of available teachers to fill vacancies. And it’s created a cascade of day-to-day disruptions within school buildings as staff chip in to cover for absent colleagues, leaving some assigned duties aside in the process. Research has shown teacher absences have a detrimental impact on student learning, which could compound the learning loss caused by ongoing disruptions in education over the past two years. States have taken a variety of measures in a desperate rush to solve the problem – from lowering entrance requirements and increasing pay to more drastic measures. Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt issued an executive order last month that permits state agencies to allow their workers to work as substitutes while keeping their regular pay. That brought uniformed police officers into schools – to lead classroom instruction. Meanwhile, New Mexico’s governor Michelle Lujan Grisham called on state workers and members of the National Guard to volunteer for classroom duty. By early February, at least 78 members of New Mexico’s National Guard reported for classroom duty. In Austin, Texas, 400 employees from the school district’s central office have chipped in to work as substitute teachers, the district said last month. So did a county judge. Beneath the immediate need for substitutes is a shortage of full-time teachers that predates the pandemic. But data indicates that Covid may have hastened some teachers’ departures from the field. In July 2020, in the months that followed Covid’s arrival, the seasonally adjusted rate of workers who quit state and local public education jobs reached 1.5% – a 20-year-high, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By the following summer, however, the quit-rate had fallen to a record low of 0.3%. And by December, the quit-rate was on par with similar government jobs. Some who resigned from education jobs may have been lured by higher pay and a better work-life balance offered in the private sector. But Peggy Wirtz-Olsen, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said others have been driven away by the challenging conditions teachers have long endured. “It’s been a double hit, with the absences caused by the pandemic plus an alarming number of teachers leaving the profession due to unrealistic workloads, low pay, and a lack of input in school decisions. All of that exacerbates the situation we find ourselves in right now,” said Wirtz-Olsen. And with remaining teachers out sick for longer periods of time this year, finding enough substitutes has presented an acute challenge. More than three-quarters of school leaders have struggled to find substitute teachers, according to a nationally representative survey conducted in the early weeks of the school year by EdWeek Research Center. Before the pandemic, schools nationally were able to fill about 80% of teacher absences, while this year it may be closer to 50% or 60%, EdWeek reported. And in California, the nation’s most populous state, fewer people are applying for permits to become substitute teachers than before Covid arrived. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of people applying for permits to work as substitute teachers dropped by 25%, according data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. While applications rebounded in 2021, they were still 87% of pre-pandemic numbers. In Wisconsin, Wirtz-Olsen said the current challenges underscore the need to improve working conditions both to recruit and retain full-time teachers as well as the high-quality substitutes they depend on. The alternative would mean further disruptions to student learning. “The constant need to step in and cover for others is putting additional stress on an already stretched system – both on educators and our support professionals in buildings who are increasingly asked to cover,” she said. “And for the student experience, that disruption is causing a lack of consistency from day to day.” In Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s largest school district, full-time elementary school teacher Angela Harris said she doesn’t remember seeing a substitute teacher in her school all year, despite staff being out sick. More often, paraprofessionals or other support staff will step in to cover for absent teachers, she said. She worries about the loss of routine and what it means for students. “It’s been a revolving door for our students, and I’ve seen the ripple effects across my school,” Harris said. “There were disparities that already existed, and Covid-19 has just exposed those gaps and made them even worse,” she said. Despite the demands and potential risks, many still find in substitute teaching the flexibility that fits their needs. That’s true even for some teachers who are at heightened risk of complications from Covid. Linda Carter, 70, works as a substitute teacher in Lee County, Florida. Because a paralyzed nerve in her diaphragm left her lung useless, she wears a non-invasive ventilator to help her breathe 18 hours a day. Carter relies on augmented voice technology to deliver instruction, feeding her lesson plans into the software in advance, then letting the electronic voice take the lead in the classroom. “I just push one of my buttons and it will tell the students what they need to do, provided they stay quiet and follow instructions,” Carter said. “I teach hi-tech.” Carter, who serves as the treasurer for the National Substitute Teachers Alliance, said she finds the work deeply rewarding and has no plans to leave the classroom anytime soon. But she can’t say the same for all of the substitute teachers she knows, many of whom are retired educators who’ve left the job out of concern about contracting and spreading Covid. Currently, at least eight states, including Florida, have banned school districts from issuing universal mask mandates. “A lot of teachers have decided to hang it up because it’s not worth the risk, and I think it’s the same around the country,” Carter said. In La Crosse, the crunch to find substitute teachers has meant better pay for Leckenby. He’s seen an increase from around $120 a day when he first started, to around $140 today. Still, fear of Covid lingers. Leckenby’s wife works with vulnerable populations. And at 54, he worries about the complications Covid could cause for him. “I haven’t been scared away. But there have been times I’ve been deeply alarmed,” he said. “With substitute teaching, there are no benefits. So if I test positive or get sick, that’s at least five days where I’m just out of work. You’re looking at several hundred dollars that could just disappear,” he said. That’s why, in addition to being vaccinated, boosted and wearing an N95 mask, Leckenby chooses to work only in school districts he knows take masking and mitigation strategies seriously. “Thankfully, there are some school districts that have mask policies and actually enforce them,” he said. “If there weren’t, it would be a lot more difficult to continue to do this work.”",News/US news,Covid puts substitute teachers in high demand and short supply,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/covid-us-substitute-teachers-shortage
2/10/2022,"College took a back seat the moment Izzy B called the suicide hotline. Izzy, 18, had spent her senior year of high school online. Then she’d gone straight to online summer school at a local community college near Denver. When in-person classes there started this past fall, she was glad to be back in the classroom and finally experiencing some real college life.  But after Omicron forced classes back online late in the semester, Izzy, who was living with her parents, felt overwhelmed by loneliness; she struggled to focus on her schoolwork and enjoy life. “We’re at this age where we’re supposed to be hanging out with our friends and socializing,” she said. “It definitely affected my mental health.” Izzy, whose full name has been withheld to protect her privacy, said she had always earned straight As, so the B she received in one class this fall was a sign something was wrong. As she seriously considered suicide, Izzy sought help and moved into her grandparents’ home in Wyoming to be closer to her extended family. And she stopped attending school. Thousands of other students around the country are leaving college – some because of mental health issues, others for financial or family reasons. Educators worry that many have left for good. Of the 2.6 million students who started college in fall 2019, 26.1%, or roughly 679,000, didn’t come back the next year, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. That was an increase of two percentage points over the previous year, and the highest share of students not returning for their sophomore year since 2012. The dropout spike was even more startling for community college students like Izzy, with an increase of about 3.5 percentage points. Researchers usually look at how many college freshmen become sophomores because if a student is going to drop out, that’s when it’s most likely to happen. While national college dropout figures have not yet been compiled for the current school year, the Omicron surge and the continued uncertainty around the virus are elevating concerns that the numbers of students abandoning college could continue to grow. The rising dropout rate on college campuses has consequences for individual students, their families and the economy. People who leave college before finishing are more likely to face unemployment and earn less than those who complete bachelor’s degrees, and they are about three times as likely to default on their student loans. With fewer college-educated workers to fill skilled jobs, the economy could also suffer in terms of lost business productivity and lower GDP. “People are worried the shadow this casts will be quite a bit longer than the pandemic itself,” said David Hawkins, chief education and policy officer for the National Association for College Admission Counseling. “This pandemic has really made an impact on a lot of students’ ability to free up time to attend school.” Related: Another million adults ‘have stepped off the path to the middle class’ The wave of students dropping out of college has hit schools of all sizes and characteristics around the country, but in different ways and for different reasons. Nassau Community College on New York’s Long Island has seen a sharp drop in returning students for the spring semester. College leaders believe some students are tired of online classes, said David Follick, dean of admissions and an assistant vice-president. Even though spring classes are evenly split between online and in-person, demand for the latter is outpacing that for online classes by at least a 2-1 ratio, Follick said. The school is trying to get students to stick around regardless of how they attend classes, he said. “We’re looking for the silver bullet,” he said. At private Ohio Wesleyan University, with an enrollment of just over 1,300, a few dozen students decided not to return this fall because the school required vaccinations, said Stefanie Niles, vice-president for enrollment and communications. And while most students have returned to Michigan State University this year, officials are alarmed by a loss of lower-income students and those who were the first in their families to attend college, said Mark Largent, the associate provost for undergraduate education and dean of undergraduate studies. Even though freshman retention is up overall, to 91.7%, the share of returning students eligible for Pell Grants (federal aid for low-income students) has dropped more than a percentage point, to 86.3% and the share of first-generation college students has fallen by 1.4 percentage points, also to 86.3%. Those students often have financial burdens forcing them to drop out. “For one student it might be a car repair, for another student it might be childcare,” said Marjorie Hass, a former college president and now president of the Council of Independent Colleges, a 765-member coalition of non-profit colleges and universities. Congress could help, she said, by dramatically increasing the amount available in a Pell Grant. Largent said Michigan State has provided additional financial help to the highest-need students, and has also been digging through data to figure out which students might benefit most from some human contact. The school recently emailed about 1,000 students who had yet to register for the spring semester; about 25% responded. Largent worries about the other 75%. “The students I engage with and the students who come back, we can learn what they need,” he said. “But what we really need to study are the students who don’t come back. The students who … sort of fall out of communication with us.” Colleges and universities have good reason to be worried about uncommunicative students, said Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of sociology and medicine at Temple University, who studies college students’ basic needs. “There is a very significant mental health crisis,” she said. “Students just are not OK. Students feeling lost, students feeling depressed, students feeling anxious – it’s weighing really heavily on them.” Staff members at Cal Poly Pomona have been so overwhelmed by students’ needs during the pandemic that they created a chatbot to help answer questions. If a student mentions certain key words, including suicide, the message is passed on to a counselor, who reaches out personally. “Students have told us they are leaving because they lost both their parents,” said Cecilia Santiago-González, the assistant vice-president for strategic initiatives for student success. “There’s definitely a lot of mental health concerns that have been brought up.” Several college officials mentioned students are taking fewer credits than before, or registering for a full load of classes and then withdrawing from some of them. Both are possible precursors to failing to graduate. About 81% of students who attend college full time graduate within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, while just 21% of part-time students graduate within six years. Students who mix full-time and part-time attendance complete degrees at a 44% rate. Often, all it takes to keep a student from dropping out of college is some personal attention. Leaders at California State University, San Bernardino, alarmed by the pandemic’s effect on student retention, recently hired re-enrollment coaches to help students who had fallen off the grid. About a quarter of those students registered for classes within three days of being contacted by the coaches, said Lesley Davidson-Boyd, the interim associate vice-president and dean of undergraduate studies. “It’s a lot of hand-holding,” she said. “Students have said things like, ‘Wow, it’s like somebody actually cared.’ ” Izzy B said she did not receive that kind of support from her Colorado college. She said she called her advisers repeatedly but never reached anyone. In California, Victoria Castro-Chavez had a different experience – and it made all the difference. In fall 2020, Castro-Chavez had about nine classes left to go at California State University, Stanislaus. But she felt pushed past her limits. Covid was devastating her family, she was working full time moving trucks at a logistics company, and she was driving more than an hour to sit in a classroom while fearing for her life. When her college classes went virtual mid-semester, she struggled to learn from a computer screen. “I was having a really difficult time passing classes and was really burned out,” said Castro-Chavez, 23, a communications studies major who hopes to become a public school teacher. “And I’ve lost four family members to Covid now. It hit me pretty hard.” As that fall semester wrapped up, Castro-Chavez, who had recently tested positive for Covid herself after losing her aunt and cousins, told her adviser she wasn’t sure she’d be back. The adviser encouraged her to take a short break and then return to school slowly, maybe just taking a couple of classes to start. The pep talk worked. Castro-Chavez took the spring semester off and focused on her trucking company job. But this past August she re-enrolled, first with a course load of two classes, and then, this semester, three. It can be challenging getting any student back on track after time off. Just 2% of 2020 high school graduates who did not immediately enroll in college showed up in fall 2021, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. The center also found that 30,600 fewer transfer students who took time off from college returned this past fall, a drop of 5.8% from the year before. Maggie Callow, 19, bucked those national trends but said it was tough to get into the college mindset after taking a pandemic-induced gap year last year. Having struggled with online classes in her final two months of high school in 2020, she just couldn’t fathom spending her first year of college online. So she spent the year at home in Bozeman, Montana, working in a pizza shop, hiking and taking a French class at Montana State University. Now halfway through her freshman year at Pomona College in Southern California, Callow was deeply disappointed when the college announced the first two weeks of the spring semester would be online. A lot of her classmates are having trouble, she said. “I think a lot fewer people are going to graduate from college,” she said. Izzy B, the 18-year-old from Colorado, said she wants to return to college eventually, to become a therapist. But for now, she’s working on her mental well-being. “We just don’t take mental health seriously,” said Izzy. “It wasn’t until I was thinking, ‘Oh, I’m going to kill myself,’ ” she said, that she realized she needed to take action to care for herself. “That was a very concrete point.” If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), and the Crisis Text Line – text HOME to 741741 – are free, 24-hour services that can provide support, information and resources.

2/10/2022,"My fellow interfaith activist Gurdeep Singh, who has died of a heart attack aged 59, was the co-creator of Gurdwara Aid, a community interest company that helps Sikh temples in the UK to deal with all kinds of administrative chores, from obtaining food safety certification to registering for gift aid and arranging safeguarding training. Gurdeep set up Gurdwara Aid with a friend, Mandip Singh, in 2019, after having spent a number of years on the committee of his local gurdwara in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, where he became involved in all aspects of its running. Initially the idea was to help and encourage other gurdwaras to claim gift aid, but soon he found himself in demand for advice in lots of other areas, including governance, risk assessments, charity registration and dispute resolution.  Gurdeep was born in Pragpur in the Punjab, India, to Ajit Singh, a till installer at a computer company, and Surjit Kaur, a factory worker, who emigrated to Britain in 1964 and settled in Hitchin. After attending Hitchin Boys’ school, Gurdeep studied telecommunications engineering at Kingston Polytechnic (now Kingston University), graduated in 1984 and worked as an a engineer with GEC Plessey Telecommunications until 1989. Settling for the rest of his life in Stevenage, after two years with Mercury Communications as a maintenance engineer he moved into management at Nortel Networks (1991-94), Telewest (1994-97) and various other telecoms companies, including Tekmark, until, through his gurdwara contacts, he became involved with the Sikh Channel television station in 2012. At the invitation of the channel’s proprietor, Gurdeep presented a weekly programme called Sikh Spectrum, in which he interviewed Sikhs from all walks of life. The show ran for two years, during which time Gurdeep co-founded the Khanda Poppy project to honour the Sikh contribution in the two world wars. Eventually the Sikh Channel appointed him as head of operations, and later CEO, and he remained there until he set up Gurdwara Aid. Gurdeep brought to his new venture great business sense, an enormous smile, a big heart and the ability to look for the best in everyone. Gurdwara Aid conferences were always packed because they reflected his caring and committed attitude, backed up by admirable professionalism. During the first Covid lockdown, the company was instrumental in setting up a group to provide Sikh feedback to the government via a special taskforce, advising on timings for the re-opening of places of worship. Gurdeep also built an online network of Sikh support, the smile shining as bright as ever each Sunday over Zoom, on which he would help to share and solve problems. When PPE became short he quickly found a donor and ensured that masks, aprons and gel were delivered in generous quantities not just to gurdwaras, but to mosques, synagogues, churches and other temples. Gurdeep is survived by his wife, Kalvinder Kaur, whom he married in 1988, a son, Jeevan, daughter, Pavenn, and three granddaughters.",News/World news,Gurdeep Singh obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/gurdeep-singh-obituary
2/10/2022,"Roy Keane has turned down the chance to take over as Sunderland’s manager and make an emotional return to the club where he held the job from 2006 to 2008. Keane, who has not worked as a manager since his sacking by Ipswich in 2011, had been Sunderland’s first choice to replace Lee Johnson.  The League One club, who have lost their past three games, had thought on Wednesday night that Keane was ready to take the post but he has informed them he will not be coming. Keane led Sunderland into the Premier League in 2007 and kept them in the top flight before resigning after a disagreement with the then owner, Ellis Short. He has been working as a television analyst and last had a coaching role in 2019 with Nottingham Forest, as an assistant to Martin O’Neill. He has also worked as a No 2 alongside O’Neill with the Republic of Ireland and Paul Lambert at Aston Villa since leaving Ipswich. The 50-year-old former Manchester United midfielder was on a Sunderland shortlist with Grant McCann, Alex Neil and Sabri Lamouchi, although other candidates could now come into consideration.

2/10/2022,"The owner of shale fracking firm Cuadrilla will permanently plug and abandon its two shale wells in Lancashire, drawing a line on Britain’s failed fracking industry. Cuadrilla set out plans to permanently seal the two shale gas wells drilled at the Preston New Road (PNR) Lancashire shale exploration site a little over two years after the government brought an end to fracking in England.  Francis Egan, the chief executive of Cuadrilla, said the government’s oil and gas regulator had ordered the “ridiculous” shutdown of the wells in the northern Bowland Shale gas formation despite Europe’s gas supply crisis. The UK’s failed shale industry consistently argued that fracking could help to secure gas supplies, but the claims were disputed by leading industry experts which warned that shale gas would not help to lower UK energy bills. The government brought in a de facto ban on fracking in late 2019 after years of bitter opposition from climate campaigners and local protest groups after a study by the industry regulator warned that fracking could not be carried out safely without the risk of triggering earth tremors. Egan said: “At a time when the UK is spending billions of pounds annually importing gas from all corners of the globe, and gas prices for hard-pressed UK households are rocketing, the UK government has chosen this moment to ask us to plug and abandon the only two viable shale gas wells in Britain.” More details to follow …",News/Environment,Fracking firm Cuadrilla to permanently abandon controversial UK sites,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/10/fracking-firm-cuadrilla-to-permanently-abandon-controversial-uk-sites
2/10/2022,"AstraZeneca forecast higher 2022 sales and lifted its annual dividend for the first time in a decade after beating fourth-quarter profit expectations, but warned the boost from its Covid-19 products would decline. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker made almost $4bn (£2.9bn) from its Vaxzevria Covid jab last year, including more than $1bn from Europe and $2.3bn from emerging markets. The jab has not yet been approved by US regulators.  AstraZeneca’s total revenues increased by 41% to $37.4bn last year. In the final quarter, sales rose 62% to $12bn. Despite the jump in sales, the drugmaker made a loss before tax of $265m (£195m), compared with a profit of $3.9bn the year before, after spending more on product launches, research & development and the acquisition of the rare diseases specialist Alexion. Its R&D spend rose by 62% to $9.7bn. AstraZeneca’s vaccine sales pale in comparison with Pfizer’s near $37bn (£27.2bn) take from its Covid-19 jab last year, which made it one of the most lucrative products in history and led campaigners to accuse the US drugmaker of “pandemic profiteering”. AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in November that the drugmaker would move away from its not-for-profit pricing for the vaccine, shifting into “profitable mode” in new contracts. He said the company would still offer affordable and tiered pricing to lower-income countries and that the vaccine, developed with Oxford University, would not become “a huge profit earner”. The company said sales from the vaccine would decline this year, partially offset by growth in sales from its new Covid-19 drug, Evusheld. It received emergency use authorisation in the US in early December and is the only antibody therapy approved in the US to prevent Covid-19 symptoms before exposure to the virus. A trial found that Evusheld reduced the risk of developing symptomatic Covid by 77% compared with a placebo. The focus this year will be on AstraZeneca’s $39bn purchase of Alexion, its largest ever deal completed in mid-July. Analysts say it should underpin future growth, along with recent drugs pipeline successes. Rare diseases medicines contributed $3.1bn of revenues last year. Soriot said: “The positive news from our pipeline, including approvals for Evusheld and Tezspire, supports the outlook for 2022. This, along with the transformative acquisition of Alexion, means that we are confident in our long-term growth and profitability.”",News/Business,AstraZeneca forecasts higher 2022 sales and lifts annual dividend,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/astrazeneca-forecasts-higher-2022-sales-and-lifts-annual-dividend
