4/4/2022,"Following the announcement by the AFL of the first AFLW match to be played at the MCG, on these pages Rana Hussain encouraged fans “to turn up and celebrate this most important milestone”. AFLW inaugural premiership coach and senior coach for Hawthorn’s AFLW team, Bec Goddard, described it as “an opportunity for our women to feel valued and to show there are no gender barriers to playing on the big stage”. Records for attendance at women’s sporting events were cited as evidence that support is there when the conditions are right, and expectations for a big turnout grew. Match attendance numbers at the AFLW have been disappointing this season, for many reasons. The combination of hot weather at largely unsheltered grounds, the already-crowded summer holidays for a traditionally family-focused fanbase and the last-minute rescheduling of the start of the season – as well as multiple games cancelled, rescheduled or moved to a different venue due to complications caused by Covid – created a perfect storm to deter attendance. A preliminary final at the MCG seemed the perfect way to redress this shortfall. Outside the stadium on Saturday, it felt like history was being made on multiple levels – and that the people who love this game knew and understood this. Queues formed with what felt like thousands of fans with the first AFLW final between Melbourne and Brisbane was about to kick off inside the famous old ground. The excitement was palpable. When the official crowd numbers were put up on the scoreboard after play had started, we were met with an underwhelming official attendance of 6,436. It was difficult not to be disappointed. But context is everything. Much like the surprise suggestion by the AFL to bring forward the next AFLW season to August this year, the announcement that the preliminary final would be played at the MCG came as a surprise to most fans, media and players. It also seemed to contradict earlier statements made by the head of women’s football at the AFL, Nicole Livingstone. Just nine days before the AFL’s historic announcement, Livingstone told Shelley Ware and Nelly Thomas on Broad Radio, that there was no capacity at most football stadiums for the AFL to host a women’s game on the same day as a men’s game. According to Livingstone, “there are very few big venues that can actually host a men’s and women’s team at the same time or a double header … to have a double header with AFLM is difficult and what I want to protect is that our AFLW players are not compromising their preparation.” Livingstone explained that the women’s teams would have to have smaller change rooms and preparation rooms, and that there was not enough space for adequate warm-ups. This situation, Livingstone conceded, included both the SCG and the MCG. The other mitigating factor was the Covid-safe requirement for there to be at least two hours and 50 minutes between matches to allow for appropriate cleaning and changeovers throughout the stadium. Yet just over a week later the AFL announced the preliminary final would indeed be played at the MCG on Saturday afternoon, despite the fact that Collingwood was scheduled to host its round three AFLM match against Geelong at the same venue at 7.25pm that night. Apparently these insurmountable issues were no longer a problem. On a practical level, the short lead time likely ruled out anyone needing to travel to see this historic match, and its timing, coinciding with the first round of community football and the VAFA, ruled out another potential fan base. It is difficult to know what impact these factors had on attendance numbers, but this doesn’t change the persistent feeling that too much of the AFLW competition is driven by thought bubbles and reactions, rather than a well-considered strategic approach. Even the long-awaited, much-vaunted eight-year plan hasn’t withstood the test of a season in terms of one of its key aims. Public challenges by individual players, calls from the AFLPA and a general sense that the 2030 deadline is unreasonable suggest a shift to full-time playing conditions is likely to happen sooner than the AFL’s preferred target. When pressed, Livingstone added that this equity was what they were aiming for, but again reminded that 160 years of the AFL men’s game dwarfed the six years of AFLW, and that expectations need to be considered within that context. Advocates for an elite level of the women’s game have been knocking on the doors of AFL house for decades. That it took the AFL so long to answer is an indictment on the organisation, not a reflection of the newness of the women’s game. But that’s the problem with history. It’s of little use when planning the future if you don’t acknowledge the context.",Sport/Sport,Meagre AFLW finals crowd at MCG was disappointing but context is everything | Nicole Hayes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/04/meagre-aflw-finals-crowd-at-mcg-was-disappointing-but-context-is-everything
4/4/2022,"Leading Queensland tourism and conservation organisations have joined forces to call on the state government to significantly increase funding to expand protected areas in the state. The state government has previously committed to doubling the area of protected land in Queensland from 8.2% to 17% – an increase of 15m hectares. But members of the new Tourism and Conservation Alliance said it was time to start investing if the government is to fulfil the promises of its Protected Areas Strategy. “We should be aiming to double [protected land] by 2032,” Dave Copeman, the director of the Queensland Conservation Council, said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If the Palaszczuk Government is going to reach the 17% target, we need to see this reflected in the 2022 state budget with funding to grow our national parks and nature refuges.” The new alliance is made up of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, Ecotourism Australia, Queensland First Nations Tourism Council, Queensland Conservation Council, Pew Charitable Trusts and the National Parks Association Queensland. It is calling on funding in this year’s budget to establish new national parks and private protected areas; ensure effective management of existing and new protected areas; and to support exceptional nature-based tourism activities. Daniel Gschwind, the CEO of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, said a doubling of Queensland’s current protected areas would provide ample benefits ahead of the 2032 Olympics. “Such an investment yields many returns for the community. Protecting and presenting new national parks will provide new opportunities for tourism, recreation and regional development across the state,” he said. Nature contributes significantly to the $23bn Queensland’s tourism industry rakes in each year, the alliance said. This includes $6.4bn attributed to the Great Barrier Reef and $3.7bn associated with national park visitation. “From the Great Barrier Reef to our outback national parks, both international and domestic tourism relies on healthy rainforests, coastlines and bushlands,” Elissa Keenan, the CEO of Ecotourism Australia, said. “We know that natural beauty and wildlife are key factors when it comes to choosing a destination for our key international markets and domestic travellers. Increasingly we are seeing people seek out nature-based, sustainably managed tourism destinations.” The alliance is also calling for the government to adhere to its commitments of providing new opportunities for Indigenous-led conservation and cultural tourism. Cameron Costello, the interim chair of the Queensland First Nations Tourism Council, said expansion of protected areas could deliver land, jobs and economic opportunity to First Nations people. “The growth in Queensland’s national parks needs to be matched with the growth in joint management opportunities and traditional knowledge to enhance park management,” Costello said. “Many First Nations groups provide essential management services for Queensland’s national parks and offer culturally appropriate, unique tourism opportunities found nowhere else.”",News/Australia news,Tourism industry joins push to expand Queensland’s national parks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/tourism-industry-joins-push-to-expand-queenslands-national-parks
