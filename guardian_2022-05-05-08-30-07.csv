5/5/2022,"Paul Kelly’s How to Make Gravy, a much-loved Australian song about a man in prison writing home to his brother at Christmas time, is to be adapted into a film. Variety reported on Thursday that Warner Bros Australia, with Speech and Drama Pictures – run by Australian musician Megan Washington and screenwriter and director Nick Waterman – has acquired the exclusive international film rights to the song. The 1996 epistolary ballad, released by Kelly in 1996, tells the story of Joe, a prisoner writing to his brother Dan about his instructions to look after his family at Christmas, and his worries that Dan and his wife might fall in love in his absence. It remains to be seen if the film will be released on the 21st of December, the date mentioned in the song’s opening lyrics and informally celebrated in Australia as Gravy Day. Michael Brooks, managing director of Warner Bros International Television Production Australia, told Variety that this gave the song “cult status” and that it was a “privilege … to unravel the mystery and meaning captured in Paul’s now iconic lyrics and bring this incredible story to screen.” “Its characters are already beloved by so many who have imagined the story behind Joe’s letter themselves – there’s so much to be found in the space between what he must be feeling in prison at Christmas and what he writes in his letter to his brother,” Washington and Waterman said. “This song holds a special place in our hearts. It’s an honour to be bringing it to life.” Kelly has previously stated that he feels Joe has appeared in two of his other songs, saying, “I’ve got a feeling it’s the same guy”: the 1987 song To Her Door and 1994’s Love Never Runs on Time.",Arts/Music,Paul Kelly song How to Make Gravy to be adapted into a Christmas film,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/05/paul-kelly-song-how-to-make-gravy-to-be-adapted-into-a-christmas-film
5/5/2022,"Manchester City will need a couple of days to come to terms with the fate that has just befallen them but they will rise again, Pep Guardiola insisted after Real Madrid stunned the Premier League champions to reach the Champions League final. Guardiola admitted it was “tough” after his players had collapsed to the turf in tears having somehow missed out on a showdown against Liverpool as Real Madrid’s impossible, barely believable journey continued, Carlo Ancelotti admitting: “Something strange has happened.” Now City must react to keep their league title challenge going, starting at Newcastle on Sunday. “We need one or two days but we will rise, we will come up,” Guardiola said, in a slow almost hushed tone, his look saying as much as his words could. “We will have do so, with our people. We did everything we could. We were really, really close but in the end we could not do it.” Asked if this was his hardest European night as a coach, Guardiola replied: “I have had bad defeats in the Champions League before. [Such as] Barcelona against Chelsea when we played two exceptional games and couldn’t make the final. But, yeah, it’s tough. We can’t deny it. “We were so close to reaching a Champions League final. We didn’t play that good in the first half but we were much better in the second half, we controlled the game and we found the goal. Unfortunately, we could not finish [it] when we were close.” There were less than three minutes remaining when Ferland Mendy performed a miracle, clearing the ball off his line and somehow keeping this competition’s great survivors alive again, yet even then no one imagined the even greater miracle that was to follow, still less the City manager. With 40 seconds of normal time left, Madrid needed to score twice to even draw level. They had barely threatened until then, Guardiola said, but astonishingly they did just that. Rodrygo Goes struck twice in 84 seconds. Then Karim Benzema put away an extra‑time penalty to send Madrid through to face Liverpool in City’s place. That sunk City here; the question now is whether it sinks them in the league too. It is Guardiola’s task to ensure that they do not. “That feeling that happens in football sometimes, that has happened in history, when you are leading but you get to the end and you are being dominated: that didn’t happen to us,” the City manager said. “We did not feel like we were under siege. We were in the lead, we had been very good in the second half and we had two [more] good chances, one of them very clear with Jack [Grealish]. They attacked with five: four forwards and Militao. But at that moment we didn’t feel that we were in trouble with the way that they attacked. “And just as the moment when we were at our best, they found the goal. Then one minute later, they found another. “They have done it lots of times in their history so it could happen to us,” Guardiola said. But he insisted that did not play on his team’s mind – even though Thibaut Courtois had suggested they might be “not crapping themselves, speaking badly, but aware that anything could happen”. “It might have been in their [minds] but not ours because we hadn’t lived that before,” he said. “But that can happen. Over 180 minutes we were brilliant, but this is about who scores more goals and they scored one more than us.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester City will need ‘one or two days’ to recover, says Pep Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/manchester-city-will-need-one-or-two-days-recover-pep-guardiola-real-madrid-champions-league
5/5/2022,"Each undergraduate costs England’s leading universities nearly £2,000 as tuition fees and teaching grants fail to fully fund a degree, and that amount is likely to double soon unless the government acts to fill the gap. A submission by the Russell Group of research-intensive universities – including the University of Manchester and University College London – to a consultation on higher education funding revealed that the average cost per student was £1,750 more than they receive in tuition fees and teaching grants. The government’s plans include a freeze on undergraduate tuition fees at £9,250 until 2024-25, which would lead to the deficit per student widening to £4,000, according to the group of 24 universities. The fee for English undergraduates has been fixed at £9,250 since 2016. Tim Bradshaw, the Russell Group’s chief executive, said the long-term funding squeeze would inevitably affect the UK’s skills pipeline. “We understand the challenges government faces in balancing the public finances, so we welcome recent investment in high-cost subjects and capital funding. However, with tuition fees frozen for another two years and costs and student demand rising, the pressure on funding for teaching will grow,” Bradshaw said. “Universities will continue to work hard and find ways of reducing that pressure so they can provide the best possible student experience, but if unaddressed over the long term this will inevitably affect the range and quality of courses that can be offered to students at a time when we need a breadth of high-level skills to drive a sustainable recovery.” The group also said plans to cut fees for foundation years – pre-entry courses taken by many mature or disadvantaged students – could reduce the number taking science and technology courses. “Foundation-year courses are vital in helping students from disadvantaged backgrounds or those who may have just missed out on entry requirements get into high-quality courses and go on to high-skilled jobs,” the group said. The government is proposing to reduce fees for foundation years provided by universities to about £5,500, the same level as fees for college access courses. The Russell Group said the lower fee would not come close to covering costs, especially in expensive courses such as engineering and medicine, with students having access to university-level facilities, teaching and support services as well as pastoral care. In one example, the University of Sheffield’s science and engineering foundation year is one of the largest in the country with more than 200 students, 95% of whom continue on to graduate with a degree.",News/Education,"Degrees underfunded by £1,750 per student, Russell Group says",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/05/degrees-underfunded-by-1750-per-student-russell-group-says
5/5/2022,"When the moment came it seemed to strike Daniele Orsato like a surge of static energy. The referee had been phlegmatic at the Bernabéu. He shrugged. He jogged. But this place does something to you. As Karim Benzema fell, ankle tapped by a lunge from Rúben Dias, even before his body hit the turf Orsato’s arm was springing out from his side, ramrod straight, possessed with the voodoo of another of these absurd electrical storms, these nights of white noise, white light, where nothing is ever done until it’s done. Benzema stepped up and rolled the penalty kick into the empty corner of the net, ran to the crowd and began slapping hands, reaching out, like a demented papal walkabout. And so it came to pass. With 89 minutes and 40 seconds of this semi-final second leg gone, Real Madrid had been on their way out of the Champions League in sickly fashion, pushed to the edge of things by a City team that had been more efficient, more coherent. With 95 minutes gone they were 3-1 up on the night and the Bernabéu was floating up off its moorings, writhing, singing to itself, high on that regal will to power. What to make of all this? There has been a great deal of mythmaking around the Bernabéu on this run. This is a magical place. A terrifying place. An enchanted canyon. A place where witches skirl about in the skies above casting dark magic. And there was the usual white noise and white light at kick-off, those craning ends creating a kind of noise funnel effect, dissolving into a barrage of whistles as the name Josep Guardiola appeared on one of the screens. They hate Pep here. He represents, well, all of it. Catalanism, Messi‑ism, clásico‑hate, other people succeeding. After which, Madrid just seemed to sit in and wait for their moment, trying to reduce the game to something smaller, a moment that could be snatched. They trod water. They watched City pass the ball. It took four minutes for Kevin De Bruyne to put his first sequence in motion, turning away from Casemiro, and producing a wonderful cinematic through pass for Gabriel Jesus. After which City kept turning on the cold tap, making those packed, fretful stands watch as they passed the ball in their neat little triangles and hexagons, asserting their own careful rhythms. Madrid had one tactic in those opening 25 minutes. Give it to Vini. Watch him go. Around the 40‑minute mark they counterattacked, feeding the ball to the left‑hand corner again like an upmarket Jack Charlton team. Vinícius Júnior was away – and then he wasn’t. Kyle Walker’s sprint back was full-thrust. The tackle was perfectly timed. It felt like maybe this was the thing that was going to happen. Maybe this is the story now? Except, somehow you knew it wasn’t. Half‑time brought whistles, arms thrown in the air, and a shrug of frustration around the stands. City had looked like a version of City that wasn’t quite City. But Madrid’s midfield had still been outgunned and outrun. Does it matter? Aged 36 now, Luka Modric just kind of hangs in there, waiting for the day to come his way. Toni Kroos spent most of the game looking gassed and pink and sweaty, like a dad on a fun run. But Kroos is also part of the myth, the show of being able to put out a midfield with a player this languid and regal. Yeah, this is us. And this is how we will beat you. With 17 minutes to play Riyad Mahrez scored a wonderful goal that seemed to kill the tie, spanking the ball into the comer of the net after a fine run and pass from Bernardo Silva. City were two goals up now. Was this it? Was this thing done? Carlo Ancelotti appeared on his touchline, shrugging and shuffling, and resembling as ever, a renaissance archduke about to ride off into battle wearing evening dress and smoking a cheroot. Rodrygo came on. That end point began to creep closer. And steadily City began to congeal. There have been times in this competition when this team has seemed brittle. As though playing football is a formal exercise, something learned and studied and reproduced . There is a team of beautiful movement, precision, passion in there. But sometimes it helps in these games to play through a mist, to play red not blue, hot not cold, as they did in the first leg. They had chances to kill this tie, most notably Jack Grealish twice at the death. The strangest part was, there was no buildup. This wasn’t coming. The earth did not shake. The air didn’t crackle. There was no sound of footsteps approaching through the forest. Instead of winding up through the gears at the Bernabéu, Real Madrid did something else, scoring twice in 84 seconds right at the death, both from Rodrygo. Then came that penalty kick, and a final half‑hour that felt, somehow, like a victory lap, an assertion of will. It is six seasons now since Guardiola first took City into this competition. Every exit hurts. Here as he walked out, bandy legged, all in black, to shake hands and face those tumbling stands, the shrill wave of noise, it was impossible not to feel the pathos of the moment. City were simply overwhelmed here, the masters of control beaten by another moment of energy, light, magic, whatever.",Sport/Football,Magic beats control as Guardiola suffers in Madrid’s enchanted canyon | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/04/magic-beats-control-once-again-in-real-madrids-enchanted-canyon
5/5/2022,"Thibaut Courtois Did what he does: produced excellent saves, particularly from Cancelo, to keep Madrid alive. 8 Dani Carvajal Defended superbly and attacked to devastating effect, delivering the cross for the equaliser. 8 Nacho Replaced the injured Alaba and didn’t put a foot wrong, as ever. 8 Éder Militão Lives on edge but somehow that suits the lunacy. Exhausted by the end having run himself into the ground. 8 Ferland Mendy Produced a miraculous goalline clearance that set up an even greater miracle. 8 Fede Valverde Has enough energy for everyone: defender, midfielder and attacker in one. Tireless again. 9 Luka Modric Played as a No 10 but biggest roar came when he chased down De Bruyne. Departure momentarily deflated this place. 6 Casemiro That cloak of invisibility still works: fortunate to escape two (dark) yellows. Tired noticeably. 5 Toni Kroos Deflected free-kick curled just over. Unable to run the game, the first man withdrawn again, and it worked again. 5 Vinicius Appealed for fans to get on their feet after 45 seconds and was still doing so 120 minutes later. 8 Karim Benzema Unable to take the kind of chances from which he carried Madrid here; was never going to miss the penalty. 8 SubstitutesRodrygo (for Kroos 68) Just incredible. Scored two and provided the pass that rescued Real Madrid yet again, 10; Asensio (for Casemiro 75) Came on to help lead the final charge, an extra striker as Madrid sought and found a miracle, 7; Camavinga (for Modric 75) Always comes on, always to enormous effect – makes Madrid a better team, an extraordinary career awaits, 8; Vallejo (for Militao 115); Dani Ceballos (for Benzema 104); Vazquez (for Vinicius 115). Ederson Warned early for time-wasting. Saved a third at the death, couldn’t save the penalty. 5 Kyle Walker Showed his speed in vital tackle on an escaping Vinicius but started to struggle. 7 Rúben Dias Steady, strong presence, until he was drawn into the foul that gave away the penalty that won this. 6 Aymeric Laporte An unnecessary confrontation earned an early yellow in an uneasy start, but improved. 6 João Cancelo Returning from injury and perhaps it showed, unable to threaten on either side and uneasy defensively. 6 Kevin De Bruyne Smoothly moving through the space in midfield, his passing crisp. City’s best player, surprisingly withdrawn. 8 Rodri A calm, tidy if not enormously influential presence in the middle, alert when Madrid threatened. 6 Bernardo Silva Superb run, if partly unopposed, and set up what looked like being the winning goal. 6 Riyad Mahrez Spent a difficult night with Guardiola in his ear and then thought he had won it with a smashing finish. 6 Gabriel Jesus Flashed a shot just past the top corner early on. Moved from middle to left, offering an outlet. 6 Phil Foden Moved in from the left to false 9, but unable to decisively influence this or really escape Madrid. 5 SubstitutesOleksandr Zinchenko (for Walker 72); İlkay Gundogan (for De Bruyne 72); Jack Grealish (for Jesus 78) Had two clear chances that would surely have confirmed City’s passage to the final, 5; Fernandinho (for Mahrez 85) Came on to see the game out and saw it become revived instead, 6; Raheem Sterling (for Rodri 99).",Sport/Football,Real Madrid 3-1 Manchester City: Champions League semi-final ratings,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-player-ratings
