4/6/2022,"New evidence has revealed that an Apple iPhone was successfully hacked by a government user of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware in December, weeks after the technology giant sued the Israeli company in a US court and called for it to be banned from “harming individuals” using Apple products. A report published on Tuesday by security researchers at Front Line Defenders (FLD) and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto found that phones belonging to four Jordanian human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists were hacked by a government clients of NSO – which appear to be Jordanian government agencies – from August 2019 to December 2021. The news appears to show that Apple users could still be vulnerable to surveillance by NSO’s government clients, even after the company sued NSO last November. At the time, Apple said it was filing suit against NSO and its parent company to “hold them accountable” for the “surveillance and targeting of Apple users”. It followed the identification of an exploit by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto that allowed users of NSO to infect iPhones with the company’s Pegasus spyware through a vulnerability in its iMessage function. Apple said at the time that the vulnerability had been patched. “The fact that the targeting we uncovered happened after the widespread publicity around Apple’s lawsuit and notifications to victims is especially remarkable; a firm that truly respected such concerns would have at least paused operations for government clients, like Jordan, that have a widely publicised track record of human rights concerns,” the report by FLD and Citizen Lab said. Jordan’s National Center for Cyber Security “categorically denied” the findings of the report. “These allegations are baseless, and Jordan has not cooperated with any agents with the aim of spying on citizens’ phones or censoring their calls,” it told the Associated Press. An NSO spokesperson had no comment on the findings, but said that the monitoring of dissidents, activists and journalist activists by any client would amount to a “severe misuse” of its product. Once Pegasus is successfully deployed against a user, it can hack any phone, intercept messages and emails, view a user’s photographs and location, and turn the mobile into a remote listening device, allowing an NSO customer to listen in on conversation held in proximity to the phone. NSO has said it investigates serious claims of abuse and that it does not know how its government clients use its spyware. It has said Pegasus is only meant to be used against serious criminals and terrorists. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The report by FLD and Citizen Lab named three Jordanians whose phones they said were hacked using Pegasus, including a human rights defender named Ahmed Al-Neimat, who is currently in prison for a case related to protests at Al-Salt state hospital, where lack of oxygen is alleged to have killed several Covid-19 patients. The researchers found that human rights lawyer Malik Abu Orabi, who represents Al-Neimat and other activists, was hacked at least 21 times between August 2019 and July 2021. A third target, Suhair Jaradat, is a human rights defender and journalist focused on women’s issues in the media. The researchers found that Jaradat had been sent text messages and WhatsApp messages with links to Pegasus spyware. The WhatsApp message, the researchers said, impersonated a popular anti-government Twitter user in Jordan. The researchers’ findings were peer-reviewed and confirmed by Amnesty International’s security lab. The latest news comes as NSO appears to be locked in battle with the managers of Berkeley Research Group, a consultancy that took over management of the fund that owns NSO last year. BRG is engaged in litigation in London with the previous owners of the fund, and claimed new details about its allegedly frayed relationship with NSO. A witness statement filed by Finbarr O’Connor, the managing director of BRG in New York, alleged that cooperation from NSO’s management has been “virtually non-existent” since it began managing the fund that owns the Israeli company. O’Connor also said that BRG is “still not in possession of information” sufficient for it to understand “historic actions” by NSO that resulted in the Biden administration placing NSO on a commerce department blacklist. NSO did not respond to questions about BRG’s claims. The allegations raise questions about corporate oversight of the company’s executive managers in the wake of last year’s publication of the Pegasus project, an investigation into NSO by Forbidden Stories, a journalistic collaboration that included the Guardian. The Pegasus project reported dozens of cases of individuals who were hacked or targeted by NSO’s government clients, including journalists, activists, and government officials. In O’Connor’s witness statement, the BRG executive said that he understood that NSO had undertaken efforts to identify potential US based investors early in 2021, but that the effort had been “halted as a result of the Pegasus Project”, which he said “negatively impacted investor interest”. NSO did not respond to a request for comment in connection to that claim. The company separately faced a new lawsuit in France by a French-Palestinian human rights defender named Salah Hammouri, who, with the International Federation of Human Rights and the Human Rights League, is suing NSO for violating privacy rights in France. An investigation by FLD published in November found that the mobile phones of Hammouri, whose Jerusalem residency status has been revoked, and five other Palestinian human rights defenders were hacked using Pegasus, NSO’s signature spyware. FLD’s findings were independently confirmed with “high confidence” by technical experts at Citizen Lab and Amnesty International’s security lab, the world’s leading authorities on such hacks. At the time, an NSO spokesperson said it could not confirm or deny the identity of government customers but that it does not operate products itself and is “not privy to the details of individuals monitored”.",News/World news,Victim’s iPhone hacked by Pegasus spyware weeks after Apple sued NSO,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/apple-iphone-pegasus-spyware-nso-group-israel-jordan
4/6/2022,"Tiger Woods’s first real memory of the Masters is of watching Jack Nicklaus play on the Sunday of 1986. Woods was 10, and had been out to play nine holes with his dad that morning, they were back in front of the TV in time to see Nicklaus, then 46, come around the turn in one of the most famous rounds in the history of the majors, from six shots back, he made five birdies and an eagle, and won by one. Woods remembers watching him hit that famous second shot on 15, from the hill over the water and to 12 feet from the hole, and the way he raised both fists in the air to celebrate, and wondering why he was so happy when he still had to make the putt. Over the years Woods has asked Nicklaus, more than once, what he was thinking about in that moment. Woods never really got a good answer out of Nicklaus, but, according to his book Unprecedented this is the way he’s come to think about it: “He did what he needed to do to put himself in a position to win the Masters. He wasn’t thinking about winning. He was thinking only about the shot, and what he needed to do. He wasn’t getting ahead of himself.” Thirty-six years later, Woods is 46 himself, a month older now than Nicklaus was when he became the oldest man to win the tournament. And of course he’s planning on breaking that record. No one, not even Woods himself, gave him a chance of doing it after the car crash last February, when he lost control of his SUV while he was doing double the speed limit on a stretch of mountain road outside Los Angeles. No one even thought he was going to make it here this year. “I never left my hospital bed even to see my living room for three months.” After that he still had months in a wheelchair, and on crutches, in and out of surgery, while they bolted together his leg “with rods and plates and screws”. “To say then that I was going to be here playing, and talking to you, it would have been very unlikely.” He didn’t wake up that first day in hospital with the idea of making it back here, back then it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to amputate his leg. Instead Woods has gone about the recovery one step at a time. Like Nicklaus, he’s doing what he needs to do day-by-day to get in a position where he can win the Masters one more time. He’s convinced he can do it, too. And because he’s Tiger Woods, who’s going to say he can’t? He still doesn’t really have all that much mobility, and doesn’t expect to ever again, and he is in pain “each and every day”. But here he is anyway. “It’s a matter of what my body’s able to do the next day, and the recovery. That’s the hard part,” Woods explained, “it gets agonising because simple things that I would normally just do now take a couple of hours here and a couple of hours there to prep and then wind down.” The idea of just walking the course for four days in a row is daunting. “It’s up to me to endure all the pain” and his medical team to help him manage the rehab, “how I am going to get all the swelling out and recover for the next day.” “But I feel like I can still do it, and I feel like I still have the hands to do it, the body’s moving good enough.” This is a man who won the 2008 US Open while he was carrying two stress fractures and a torn anterior cruciate ligament, who won the 2019 Masters two years after he had undergone spinal fusion surgery. “I’ve been in worse situations and played and won tournaments. Now I haven’t been in situations like this where I’ve had to endure what I’m going to try and endure, that’s a different challenge. But my back surgeries and all the stuff I’ve had to play through before, those are all things I can draw upon where I was successful.” Woods once said that his win here in 2019 felt like his Everest, and that, having climbed it once, he didn’t feel the need to do it again. The injuries gave him a mountain to climb, and a new reason to try and do it, too. Woods didn’t just lose control of his car that night, he lost control of his career, too, and for a time, the question of whether he was ever going to be able to play, to compete, to win, again, was taken out of his hands. Which would be hard for anyone, but must have been utterly intolerable for a man who has spent his whole life defying the limits other people have tried to put on him. “I don’t know how many more years I can still do this,” he said at one point, while he still can, he still will, however much it hurts.",Sport/Sport,Tiger Woods prepared to play through pain barrier in unlikely Masters quest,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/05/tiger-woods-prepared-to-play-through-pain-barrier-in-unlikely-masters-quest
4/6/2022,"The Michigan congressman Fred Upton has become the fourth of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump over the Capitol attack to announce his retirement in November. The others are Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a member of the January 6 committee, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio and John Katko of New York. The retirements are seen as further boosting Trump’s power and influence with Republicans. Underscoring his control of the party, Trump issued a brief but celebratory statement, saying: “UPTON QUITS! Four down and six to go. Others losing badly, who’s next?” Liz Cheney of Wyoming, another member of the January 6 committee, is among the six remaining Republicans who voted to impeach and now face Trump-backed challengers. Upton made his announcement on the House floor. He did not refer to his impeachment vote. He said: “I work daily on all things Michigan, particularly with Debbie Dingell [a Democrat], and we’ve been hitting the road to push for civility. “Hopefully civility and bipartisanship versus discord can rule not rue the day.” Upton, whose close relationship with Joe Biden caused Biden a headache during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, also said he had “worked with seven administrations, seven House speakers, none of them would call me a rubber stamp. “If it’s good policy for Michigan, it’s good enough for all of us. As the vice-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, we have pushed the envelope to get things done.” Upton did mention Trump in reference to his vote last year for Biden’s “real, honest-to-goodness infrastructure bill which passed 69 to 30 in the Senate but then hit the rocks here in the House, barely surviving Trump’s opposition despite his call for a proposal twice as expensive with no pay-fors”. Upton’s support for the bill earned him death threats. In one message, which he shared, a man called him a “fucking piece of shit traitor” and said: “I hope you die. I hope everybody in your fucking family dies.” Parties that hold the White House often suffer in the first midterms after a presidential election. Republicans are favoured to take the House this year. Had Upton run for re-election, redistricting would have forced him to face off with another Republican congressman, Bill Huizenga, who has Trump’s endorsement. On Monday, Upton told NBC Trump was “a little bit on the scorched earth path”. Asked what message he would send Trump if he beat Huizenga, he said: “Well, it’s that he’s not as strong as he might have thought that he was. “But … if we run, we’re gonna run our own race. I’m not changing my votes. I don’t cast political votes. I’m not afraid to vote for or against my party when I think they’re right or wrong. Some of the folks here are so beholden to Trump that they don’t accept those of us that are willing to stand up.” He also reiterated his support for investigations of the Capitol attack and said: “If we’re going to be in the majority, we have to appeal to more than just the Trump [supporters]. They’re not a majority in the country. They may be a majority within our party, but not particularly in the midwest. “They are not a majority among all voters, and that’s why you’ve got to have the appeal that can reach across just that … hardcore party base that really is unforgiving.” The next day, however, he decided not to run. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip, told reporters: “This was a decision [Upton] had to make looking at the dynamics of a member-on-member race.” Gonzalez, a former NFL player who nonetheless declined to face his own challenge, said he would step down last September. As he did so, he cited “toxic dynamics” inside the Republican party.",News/US news,Fourth House Republican who voted to impeach Trump announces retirement ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/fred-upton-house-republican-retirement-impeach-trump
4/6/2022,"Boris Johnson has urged Russian citizens not to fall for Vladimir Putin’s propaganda and circumvent tough internet censorship rules by installing technology to discover the full extent of war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine. In a video address posted on social media, the prime minister appealed to people in Russia to “look at what is being done in your name”, highlighting scenes of civilians being left dead in streets and women raped in front of their children that he said had “horrified the world”. The images have sparked international condemnation, and fuelled further calls for scrutiny by the international criminal court. Speaking in Russian, Johnson said: “The Russian people deserve the truth, you deserve the facts.” Picture of bodies that have been burned, dumped in mass graves or left strewn on roads vacated by retreating Russian forces in Burcha and Irpin were “so shocking, so sickening, it’s no wonder your government is seeking to hide them from you”, he continued in English. “Your president knows that if you could see what was happening, you would not support this war.” Johnson said the crimes “betray the trust of every Russian mother who proudly waves goodbye to her son as he heads off to join the military” and were a “stain on the honour of Russia itself – a stain that will only grow larger and more indelible every day this war continues”. Although dissent has been harshly cracked down on in Russia, the prime minister urged people living in the country to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access independent information about the brutality of Putin’s military campaign. The technology allows people to get around restrictions on specific content based on their geolocation by connecting to a network or server that is based in another country. “Don’t just take my word for it: all you need is VPN connection to access independent information from anywhere in the world,” Johnson said. “When you find the truth, share it. Your president stands accused of committing war crimes. But I cannot believe he is acting in your name.” Many Russians may struggle to access Johnson’s social media video, given Putin’s government has blocked access to Facebook and the state communications regulator said access to Twitter had also been restricted.",News/World news,Johnson speaks directly to Russians about images that have ‘horrified world’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/boris-johnson-speaks-directly-to-russians-about-images-that-have-horrified-world-ukraine
4/6/2022,"Let’s try to take the government’s case for privatising Channel 4 at face value. It runs something like this: far from being motivated by revenge for critical coverage, ministers are aiming to ensure the channel thrives in the long-term. According to this line of thinking, Channel 4, despite its healthy-looking record surplus of £74m in 2020, is in danger of being crushed by Netflix, Amazon Prime et al in the new era of subscription and streaming. It relies on advertising income and, under its current remit, can’t produce programmes in-house. Look forward a decade and the sums spent with independent UK producers could dwindle. What worked in the past doesn’t guarantee success in the future. There are probably two key government texts that have sketched out this thesis, and neither came from Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary who was shockingly uninformed about Channel 4’s financing when appearing before MPs last year. One was a speech by John Whittingdale, as media minister, last September when he said that, at some point, Channel 4 would need cash to grow and that only the private sector could be expected to provide. He offered a vision of the best of both worlds: a remit that protects independent news and regional production but adds deeper pockets. A spin on a similar theme was offered by Andrew Griffith, the former Sky finance director who is now head of the No 10 policy unit, in a column in the Daily Telegraph last year. He said Channel 4’s “next, and most enduring, contribution to the UK media landscape may be to keep some of its distinctive remit but as part of adding useful scale to another UK-based operator”. These analyses also tend to contain a strong strain of regret that the UK doesn’t have a streaming operation capable of giving the Americans a run for their money. Both Whittingdale and Griffith were damning about how the Competition and Market Authority in 2009 killed a proposed streaming collaboration between the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. “The UK’s competition regulator took the ball away before we could even get on the pitch,” wrote Griffith. At this point, however, the grand theorising meets the hard reality of who the government expects to buy Channel 4. Most of the names on outsiders’ list of candidates are American. Given the patriotic preamble, it would be perverse to serve up Channel 4 on a platter to a US giant such as Discovery and Paramount, owner of Channel 5. Even Sky is owned by Comcast of the US these days. ITV could play the role of “national champion” and would probably be able to achieve a few budget-enhancing savings. But ITV faces its own challenges in adapting to the age of streaming and one suspects any interest on its part would primarily flow from the defensive instinct to avoid fresh competitive headaches. Channel 4 might be left as an unloved add-on, which wouldn’t help anybody. Alternatively, ministers may imagine that UK venture capital will rush to fly the flag for British television. Well, possibly, but such bidders, like all private-sector parties, would want an answer to the second question overhanging the privatisation process: what public service obligations would still attach to Channel 4? Until a media bill, covering wider public service broadcasting requirements, appears, there is no clarity. In its absence, Whittingdale’s hopeful talk about “the false binary choice between public service content and privatisation” doesn’t count for anything. Prospective buyers of Channel 4 will see a clear tension: freedom to set budgets can make a real difference to profits. Meanwhile, government muttering about a “creative dividend” from a sale, meaning redirecting proceeds towards boosting regional production-making, sounds extremely vague. In its current incarnation, Channel 4 is surely fulfilling the role better than any minister could hope to do. As more than a few Tories have noted, the channel still meets the original Thatcherite vision of unleashing entrepreneurial instincts among independent production houses. And 55% of spend on new content last year was commissioned from companies outside London, which deserves a tick in the levelling up box. Therein lies the real oddity of the privatisation plan. Flogging Channel 4 will not bring about the longed-for British reply to Netflix. It’s not big enough and it’s too late to mourn decisions taken by shortsighted competition regulators in 2009. The risk in privatisation is that Channel 4’s clear and obvious current benefits – diversity in programming and regional spending – get lost without a corresponding gain. Tory rebels should keep pushing. A compelling business case for a sale simply hasn’t been made.",News/Business,Flogging Channel 4 won’t bring about the longed-for British reply to Netflix | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/05/flogging-channel-4-wont-bring-about-the-longed-for-british-reply-to-netflix
4/6/2022,"Fresh allegations of atrocities by occupying troops have emerged as a Ukrainian man described three days and nights of torture, mock executions and the disappearance of fellow prisoners during his captivity by Russian forces in the town of Borodyanka. Petro Titenko, 45, told the Guardian of his three nights of hell at the hands of Russian and Chechen soldiers after he was picked up for breaking curfew, during which he was beaten, forced to kneel in what he was told was his grave and had bullets shot at his head and feet. Titenko, his wife, Yulia, and his 21-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter had been forced to move from central Borodyanka to Druzhnya, on the town’s outskirts, on 26 February after a shell blew away the roof of their home. But their hell was yet to truly begin, they said. In Druzhnya, the couple hunkered down day and night in their cellar, aware, they said, that any civilians outside were being killed. But on the evening of 18 March Titenko decided to try to slip out after curfew to check on his brother less than three miles away. Halfway there, at about 6.30pm, three Russian soldiers armed with machine guns emerged from the woods and accused him of giving Russian locations away to the Ukrainian army. He was searched, his hands were tied behind his back and a sack was roughly put over his head. Titenko said he was taken into the woods and tied with rope to the back of a tank which the soldiers turned on so that he breathed in the fumes from the shoulder-height exhaust pipe. After 30 minutes the engine was turned off and he was left there. Unable to move, Titenko stood all night in the freezing cold, thinking only the worst. In the morning, he said, he heard the Russians bring a second prisoner, who was babbling information to the soldiers in an apparent effort to save his own life. “He was saying a rocket flew from there, an artillery installation was installed there,” Titenko said. “They told him it was valuable information and that they would release him.” It was a false and mocking promise. The two prisoners were loaded on top of the tank and driven for an hour, Titenko said, struggling to contain his emotion as he recalled the conversation he heard between two of his captors. “Did you bring prisoners again?,” said one. “So?,” responded the second, to which he first answered: “I’m tired of burying them in the ground.” Titenko said he was forced to lie on the mud where he stayed for what he estimates was four hours. Then he was lifted to his feet and kicked down the side of what he realised was a pit. “You do not want to add anything to your words?” asked the soldier, whose accent he recognised as Chechen. Titenko asked to be allowed to pray as he heard the rack being pulled on the soldier’s machine gun, ready to fire. “At that point I was sure I would be killed and buried. And my wife and my children will never know where I died. At that moment I asked God: let me get through this.” Titenko was left to lay there in what he had believed was his grave for a further three hours with the second prisoner before being taken to be fed a small bowl of porridge. He was then pushed into the back of a truck and the sack was again forced over his head. His arms, now pained by the ties, were loosened from their binds. There was talk of the men being released. The soldiers said they could take the sacks off their heads after a period of 10 minutes. They did so and discovered they were by a cottage and that it was nearly 6pm on their second day of captivity. Titenko’s fellow prisoner decided to flee through the woods. Titenko stayed in the house but after an hour and a half more Russian soldiers burst in. Again he was tied up and the sack put back over his head. “I was interrogated all night,” he said. “They wanted to know if I was a spy for the Ukrainian army. They took all my documents, passport, car documents, driver’s licence.” Titenko was driven, still blinded, to a place where he said there were evidently other prisoners. “Some were shouting there, some were crying,” he recalled. Tied up, he and the other prisoners were beaten with flexes. “I was beaten for 15-20 minutes,” he said. “Then a machine gun was fired over my head, shot at my feet. All this time I prayed to God to save my life.” The humiliation and intimidation continued, he said. He was stripped to his underwear. “We are looking for Ukrainian tattoos on your body,” a soldier said. “If we find them, we will cut them together with the skin.” “You are Bandera, you are Nazis,” they shouted. The prisoners were then forced to their knees, where they were left to contemplate the worst for an hour. It was a concrete floor and after a while they were allowed to lie down due to the agony in their knees. They were searched. Something suspicious was found in one man’s pockets. “He was taken out and I never saw him again,” said Titenko. By now it was evident, even through the sack on his head, that the babbling prisoner he had been with earlier in his ordeal had been recaptured. “That man kept saying a lot of different nonsense,”Titenko said. “The Russians took him out and I never saw him again either.” The evening came. The prisoners were taken to a canteen where they were given porridge before the men, again with their heads covered, were put in some showers to sleep on the tiles. “There was so little space. It was impossible to lie there so we all stood there all night,” he said. The next morning the prisoners, cold, hungry and terrified of what more was to come, were loaded into a truck, taken away and dropped off. They were freed. They were near the village of Ozera, about 20 miles from Titenko’s home. He began to walk but he did not have any documents and he knew the Russian checkpoints were coming. At the first, the Russian soldiers asked who he was. He replied that he had been in captivity and had no documents. He was allowed to pass, and then it was the same story for miles until he reached a fourth checkpoint where a column of military equipment was passing by. “A Russian soldier told me that I had to get on my knees and lower my head. Not to see Russian military equipment. If I didn’t, I would get shot in the head,” he said. He would kneel down and lower his head about 25 times on the journey. When he arrived home, the family decided they had to leave, and they braved a mined road to get away to the west.",News/World news,Ukrainian man accuses Russians and Chechen troops of mock executions and days of torture,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/ukrainian-man-tells-of-days-of-torture-at-hands-of-occupying-troops
4/6/2022,"Flying from Islamabad to Colombo gives a bird’s-eye view of the fallout from war over the subcontinent. The three nations under the route are all governed by nationalists who won office by trading in populism. Having gained power, such politicians tend to have a messianic faith in their capacity to effect sweeping change. This belief is being tested, perhaps to destruction, in south Asian democracies with a combined population of 1.6 billion people. Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan – who was in Moscow as the tanks rolled into Ukraine – claimed last week that the US had “threatened” him and tried to instigate regime change. Mr Khan has been at loggerheads with the west since Pakistan abstained in the UN resolution condemning Moscow’s attack. Over the weekend the nation’s army – long considered the power behind the throne – openly sided with Washington. Mr Khan has refused to leave quietly. Instead of facing a no-confidence vote that he would have almost certainly lost, he precipitated a political crisis by dissolving parliament. Pakistan’s judges now have the casting vote on the prime minister’s fate. At the other end of the flightpath is Sri Lanka’s hardline president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He imposed a state of emergency to forestall a popular revolt. With four brothers in the cabinet, the Rajapaksas dominate Sri Lankan politics. Their supremacy is largely down to the damaging polarisation of the country along religious and ethnic lines after a bloody civil war. Mr Rajapaksa’s quixotic economic policies came unstuck when the war in Ukraine sent energy and commodity prices soaring. There is little sign of rational measures to halt the downward spiral. South Asia’s biggest strongman is India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. Like Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, Mr Modi has remained neutral on the war – refusing to condemn Vladimir Putin and sidestepping US-led sanctions. Delhi is caught in a bind. Despite clashes along their shared border, India’s trade with China has set new records. While the past decade has seen India deepen security ties with the US to balance Beijing, Russia still provides about half of India’s arms imports. This dependence might explain why, when Indian students in Ukraine were being killed by Russian bombs, Mr Modi’s ministers blamed them for being in harm’s way. Mr Modi is quiet about his true intentions. This raises hopes in Moscow of Indian support, hopes in Beijing that Delhi might forsake Washington, and concerns in the west that India’s prime minister puts a premium on his nation’s immediate interests rather than aspirations to be a natural ally. This may heighten Mr Modi’s sense of India’s difference, and see him embrace greater self-reliance. This would be welcome if his nation’s economic performance had been helped by his policymaking. But his penchant for dramatic gestures has stymied India’s rise. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could shape the contours of a coming wider global struggle between autocracy and democracy. History might side with that perspective – but it seems a straw man argument in a region where the slide into rightwing, nationalist populism should be, right now, a bigger concern.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on strongmen and straw men: south Asian crises over Russia’s war | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/the-guardian-view-on-strongmen-and-straw-men-south-asian-crises-over-russias-war
