4/5/2022,"On the shorelines of New Zealand’s north island, shores have been lit up by the glowing “aurora of the sea”: blooms of plankton that glow blue-green after nightfall. The elusive, beautiful phenomenon that sometimes sweeps into the coasts was witnessed by local “biohunter” enthusiasts who scour the shorelines for bioluminescence. “It’s also called the aurora of the sea – like the Aurora Australis you see in the sky,” says Sajith Muraleedharan, a photographer who captured the phenomenon in Napier. The light is activated by movement: cresting waves begin to glow, splashes sparkle, footprints glimmer blue in the wet sand, and swimming fish can leave sparkling trails. “Every time a wave comes in, you can see this beautiful phenomenon. It’s amazing – a lot of people were there, a lot of people with families, some of them were swimming,” Muraleedharan said. “It is indeed a great thing to witness.” The phenomenon is caused by blooms of plankton and phytoplankton species, some of which use the “luminescence” adaptation to evade or distract predators. “Dinoflagellates produce this light when disturbed, and will give a light flash lasting a fraction of a second – disturbing the predator trying to consume them,” said Karl Safi, algal ecologist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. The glowing waves are unpredictable, but Safi said they were “common on warm nights and may also occur after days of heavy rain”. The phenomenon only occurs at night, Safi said, as the creatures have an inbuilt biological clock, and do not glow during the daytime – even if put into a dark space or container. Microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles uses bioluminescence to track the growth of infectious disease in a laboratory setting – but says she is also an enthusiast, and has gone hunting to see the creatures lighting up in the wild. Around New Zealand’s shorelines, amateur “biohunting” groups have sprung up, where watchers alert one another if they’ve seen the phenomenon occurring, and sometimes travel up the coast to try to witness it. “People post if they’ve seen anything and it’s been quite quiet this year, so it was really great to see that one,” Wiles said of the Napier sighting. She has been “hunting” twice to see the waves lighting up. “The more people who see it, the better I think,” Wiles says. “It’s just this beautiful – magical really – kind of amazing phenomenon.”",News/World news,‘Aurora of the sea’: luminous plankton light up New Zealand shores,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/aurora-of-the-sea-luminous-plankton-light-up-new-zealand-shores
4/5/2022,"Another senior Liberal has taken aim at Scott Morrison, accusing him of “self-serving ruthless bullying” and claiming he has “ruined” the Liberal party. Catherine Cusack, a New South Wales Liberal who announced two weeks ago she would resign from the Legislative Council over her anger about flood relief, adds her voice to a growing chorus of critics of Morrison from within his own party in an opinion piece for Guardian Australia. Cusack explicitly endorses the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells’s “character assessment of the prime minister” and reveals she will not vote for his government in the May election. Morrison has rejected the claim flood funding had been politicised as “untrue” because the government had acted on advice and later extended the payments. On Tuesday Fierravanti-Wells labelled the prime minister an “autocrat” and a “bully” in an excoriating Senate speech revealing allegations he had made “racial comments” when running for preselection in 2007. Morrison has vehemently denied the claims, contained in statutory declarations reported in the Saturday Paper and then publicly backed by his preselection opponent, Michael Towke. Cusack accused Morrison of having “ruined” the Liberal party and said he had “trashed” its values over two decades, as state director, “then as a scheming MP and now as prime minister finding loopholes in our constitution to delay preselections in order to get his way”. She criticised Morrison for “forcing moderates to vote for [former Liberal and now United Australia party leader MP] Craig Kelly” when his preselection was under threat before the 2019 election. She has warned she will vote against the prime minister over factional “scheming” and politicised allocation of flood relief. “But he has outdone himself engineering a federal intervention to jump over the organisation all together. “He got what he wanted at the expense of destroying our rules-based selection system and disgusting virtually every member of the NSW division.” Morrison’s immigration minister and proxy in the NSW party, Alex Hawke, has been accused of procedural delays prompting a takeover of federal preselections by a three-person panel, including Morrison and the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet. The NSW court of appeal is set to rule on Tuesday whether the takeover and resultant preselections complied with Liberal party rules. Cusack, a longtime critic of the Liberal party’s culture towards women, has spoken out about the exclusion of Ballina, Byron and Tweed from federal disaster payments, a decision reversed in mid-March. She said: “Scott Morrison’s brazen attempt to fund flood victims in a National party seat and exclude flood victims in a Labor seat that I happen to live in was just too much … “To see the self-serving ruthless bullying that has increased inside the Liberal party spill over into public policy and the poorest most vulnerable Australians who lost everything in the floods are the targets of this outrageous abuse of morality and power is simply intolerable.” Cusack said assistance had “extended to all northern rivers victims” after their exclusion became too “embarrassing”, but the prime minister now appeared to be “refusing to engage NSW government on additional measures that are so needed for victims of this incredible disaster”. “It’s so bad I am moved to endorse Connie’s character assessment of the PM. ‘It’s my way or the highway’. For flood victims. Un-bloody-believable.” Asked about Cusack’s claim flood victims in the Nationals’ seat of Paige were looked after but those in Labor-held Richmond were not, Morrison responded it was “simply untrue”. “The $7,000 or thereabouts that households have been receiving in additional disaster payments extend across all seven [local government areas] – including the one she lives in,” he told reporters in South Sydney. “We listed those first LGAs first because they were the most obvious ones, and that was the advice of our agencies, and then I said we’d be assessing further, which we did, and we extended it to the other four. “So it’s just wrong in fact.” Morrison has denied the allegations made by Towke and several Liberal preselectors, that he had warned after the Cronulla riots a Lebanese Australian could not hold Cook, and discussed a false rumour Towke was a Muslim. These are “completely untrue”, he said on Sunday. “It is outrageous, absolutely outrageous,” the prime minister said. “I’ve dealt with it time and again, and the leaders of the Lebanese community, I think voices have spoken most significantly about this matter – and just what’s behind all this and I think it’s very clear.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Monday Towke branded Morrison “a compulsive liar” and declared he did not deserve to be prime minister. “I think it’s pretty obvious he is – he’s got form on that, just ask Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, Emmanuel Macron … Barnaby Joyce called him out.” On Sunday Morrison blamed the allegations on “individuals who haven’t liked the answer they’ve got” from party preselection processes. “People will throw all sorts of mud at you – particularly when you get up close to an election and they’ll make all sorts of things up because they have other motivations.” Cusack rejected any suggestions of ulterior motives for her critique. “The truth is, there has been no conspiracy in my decision to speak out about Scott Morrison … “Nobody puts words into my mouth. I am what they call a ‘problem woman’, plus I live in the regions where we just call it out as deserved.” Cusack warned Morrison that “punishing our flood victims” or the NSW government for her decision to speak up is “another chapter in the disgrace of the prime minister’s approach to this flood catastrophe”. She also criticised the federal Liberal party’s handling of climate change, which she said had, “encouraged by the Murdoch press, delayed the urgent need for … action by at least 15 years”. “The climate change fight has divided and just exhausted many of us in the NSW Liberals. “Sitting here in the flood-ravaged northern rivers I can only deplore how much time has been lost.”",News/Australia news,Liberal MP accuses Scott Morrison of ‘ruthless bullying’ and scheming at the expense of flood victims,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/liberal-mp-catherine-cusack-scott-morrison-ruthless-bullying-flood-victims
4/5/2022,"The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age newspapers will pay former columnist Clementine Ford roughly $60,000, after defamation proceedings over comments from the mastheads’ executive editor. On Tuesday, the federal court entered a judgment in favour of Ford in the proceedings she launched against the former Fairfax newspapers now owned by Nine, and Tory Maguire, the executive editor, with the order that Ford be paid $39,000 – an amount the parties had agreed to by compromise. Maguire and her publishers were also ordered to pay Ford’s legal costs, which Guardian Australia understands totalled about $20,000. Nine will cover all of the agreed costs. Tuesday’s judgment was not a decision of merits from the court, rather it reflected that Nine had consented to judgment against itself. Ford, who quit as a columnist at the newspapers in 2019 after she was internally cautioned over a tweet calling the prime minister, Scott Morrison, a “fucking disgrace”, had given an interview to the Nine newspapers’ Spectrum section in November 2021 about her new book, How We Love. The article was published on the Herald and the Age’s websites on 21 January, but was subsequently taken down, and the piece did not appear in Spectrum’s print edition. After the interview with Ford was pulled, Maguire explained reasons behind the decision, telling Guardian Australia’s Weekly Beast column: “Clementine Ford spent years making vile and personal attacks on the journalists and editors of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age after the mastheads stopped publishing her column. “I had knocked back a pitch for an interview with her but there was a breakdown in communication and it was commissioned and published in error. I have pulled it from Spectrum and taken it down out of respect for my team,” Maguire said. Ford claimed Maguire’s comments carried the defamatory imputations that she had “spent years making vile and personal attacks on the journalists and editors” at the newspapers, that she “behaved vengefully and abusively towards” and had a “personal vendetta” against her former colleagues after leaving as a columnist. Ford’s statement of claim argued that Maguire’s comments could cause serious harm to her “reputation for championing women’s rights”, attacked her professionalism, and would be likely to impact sales of her new book. A statement released on behalf of Nine and Maguire said: “We’re pleased this matter has concluded.” It is understood the newspapers do not plan to publish the initial interview with Ford. Before launching defamation proceedings, Ford requested an apology over the comments, which was refused. Guardian Australia understands no apology will be made following Tuesday’s consented judgment. Ford said Tuesday’s “judgment is a win not just for me, but for all the women who are relentlessly attacked and misrepresented by media organisations so deeply wedded to their own hubris that they assume we will not fight back”. She also thanked her legal team, which included prominent defamation barrister Sue Chrysanthou, and Rebekah Giles. “Robust dialogue and even disagreement must always be celebrated in the public sphere, but I will not stand by as mendacious lies are put forward about me and my conduct towards my colleagues. “The entry of judgment in my favour today by consent represents an acceptance that the statement made by Tory Maguire about me and against me was false and defamatory, and I feel vindicated in this outcome,” Ford said.",News/Media,Clementine Ford wins defamation suit against Sydney Morning Herald and Age,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/05/clementine-ford-settles-defamation-suit-with-sydney-morning-herald-and-age
4/5/2022,"Joe Biden has called for the prosecution of Vladimir Putin for war crimes after the discovery in Bucha, Ukraine, of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range. But bringing the Russian president to trial would be far from simple.What are war crimes?The international criminal court (ICC), the world’s first permanent war crimes tribunal, defines them as “grave breaches” of the Geneva Conventions, a set of humanitarian laws to be observed in war.Jonathan Hafetz, an international criminal law and national security scholar at Seton Hall University School of Law, told the Reuters news agency that the execution of civilians as alleged in Bucha was a “quintessential war crime”. Russia continues to deny culpability. Its defence ministry insisted on Sunday that “not a single civilian has faced any violent action by the Russian military”.How can a case pointing to war crimes be built?Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, told reporters on Monday that there were four main sources of evidence: information gathered by the US and its allies including from intelligence sources; Ukraine’s own efforts on the ground to develop the case and document forensics from the killings; material from international organisations including the UN and NGOs; and findings by global independent media with photos, interviews and documentation. Can Putin be held personally responsible for his troops’ actions?The prosecution could argue that Putin and his inner circle committed a war crime by directly ordering an illegal attack or knew crimes were being committed and failed to prevent them. This case may be hard to prove in isolation but if it fits a wider pattern across Ukraine, it becomes more compelling. The US had accused Russia of war crimes even before Bucha. Philippe Sands, a professor at University College London, told the Associated Press: “You’ve got to prove that they knew or they could have known or should have known. There’s a real risk you end up with trials of mid-level people in three years and the main people responsible for this horror – Putin, Lavrov, the minister of defence, the intelligence folks, the military folks and the financiers who are supporting it – will get off the hook.”Who would run such a trial? The ICC opened 20 years ago to prosecute the perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity. But the US, China, Russia and Ukraine are not members of the court, which has been criticised for focusing too heavily on Africa and applying “selective justice”. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in February he had opened a war crimes investigation in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Although it is not a signatory, Ukraine previously approved an investigation dating back to 2013, which includes Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The ICC will issue arrest warrants if prosecutors can show “reasonable grounds” to believe war crimes were committed. But there is little chance that Russia would comply and the ICC cannot try someone in absentia. The US’s unwillingness to join the court is also diplomatically awkward and likely to prompt cries of western hypocrisy. Donald Trump once told the UN general assembly: “As far as America is concerned, the ICC has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy, and no authority.” His administration announced that the US would impose visa bans on ICC officials involved in the court’s potential investigation of Americans for alleged crimes in Afghanistan. But Sullivan said on Monday: “The US has in the past been able to collaborate with the international criminal court in other contexts despite not being a signatory. But there’s a variety of reasons one might consider alternative venues as well.” What are these “alternative venues”? The UN seems an obvious starting point. But one problem with going through the UN security council is that Russia is a permanent member. “It would be difficult to imagine that they would not attempt to exercise their veto to block something,” Sullivan observed. Another option might be a special tribunal organised by a group of countries. The Nuremberg tribunal was established by the US, Britain, France and the Soviet Union to hold Nazi leaders to account after the second world war. Potential models for Ukraine could include the tribunals set up to prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s and the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Another example was the UN-backed special court for Sierra Leone, established in 2002 to bring to justice those responsible for atrocities perpetrated during the country’s country’s civil war in 1996. What about a different charge? It would be easier to prosecute Putin for the crime of aggression after he waged an unprovoked war against another sovereign country. The ICC does not have jurisdiction over Russia for the crime of aggression because Russia is not a signatory. Last month dozens of prominent lawyers and politicians, including the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and the former British prime minister Gordon Brown, launched a campaign to create a special tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. How long would a prosecution take?Probably many years. The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicted its first head of state, the then Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milošević, in 1999 and took him into custody in 2001. His trial began in 2002 and was under way when he died at the Hague in 2006. Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, was found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity for supporting rebels who carried out atrocities after four years of hearings at the special court for Sierra Leone in the Hague.",News/World news,Explainer: could Vladimir Putin be prosecuted for war crimes?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/putin-war-crimes-accusation-ukraine-icc
