4/20/2022,"Every immigrant knows that the key to integration is learning the language of their new country. For many the language they brought with them is simply a relic of their former life. In Barcelona, a project is turning that on its head with the philosophy that no one arrives in a host country empty-handed. They may not yet have a job or much of an education, they may even be staying illegally, but they have a language – often more than one. Since 2020, the Prollema (pro-llengua materna, or pro-mother tongue) project has been helping those from north and west Africa gain confidence by helping them teach their mother tongue, the Berber – or Amazigh – languages, as well as Darija, Falu and Wolof. Based at Nau Bostik, a former glue factory now home to a range of cultural and community initiatives, the scheme is open for people aged 17 to 23, unemployed and at risk of social exclusion. About two-thirds are undocumented migrants and more than 80% have no income. Darija, a form of Arabic, is the mother tongue of as many as three-quarters of Moroccans, who often speak Tamazight, (a standardised version of the Amazigh languages), or one of the other Amazigh languages as well. “We thought, these young people can’t work and they don’t have anything to do, why not start a project based on their mother tongue?” says David García Savalls, the project’s coordinator. “On this basis, they learn to express themselves.” Successful candidates undergo a four-month training course to become teachers, although García Savalls uses the terms “those who show” and “learners” rather than teachers and students. After practising on volunteers, they begin taking classes of five students who pay a small fee that, alongside some public subsidy, gives the teachers an income. “When a young person sees they are being listened to and people are learning from them, it has a huge impact,” says García Savalls. “The mother tongue is an excuse or a vehicle. What happens is they gain in confidence and self-esteem.” So far, 40 people have gone through the scheme, each teaching three groups of students over a period of seven months. The curriculum is elementary and based on their own experience as immigrants struggling to learn the host language. “I never imagined I’d be teaching my language,” says Mohamed Oulhisse, 23, who teaches Amazigh. “It’s opened doors for me. I’ve been able to meet people and share a cultural exchange with the students. It’s made it possible for me to work as a translator in organisations working with immigrants or families with kids in school but whose parents don’t speak Spanish or Catalan.” Chaimae Benlemchkraf, 25, taught Darija at Nau Bostik and is now in charge of expanding the scheme to Tarragona, 100km south of Barcelona. “It’s given me a lot more self-confidence,” she says. “I’m not a nobody any more, I’m an ambassador and the person responsible for the project here in Tarragona.” Students range from those working with immigrants to people who want to travel to Morocco or are simply keen to learn a new language. There are no other facilities in the region for learning Amazigh or Darija. Sònia Angelats, 33, works in adult education and her students are mostly young north African men aged 18 to 25. “I wanted to at least be able to speak basic Darija so I did an intensive course with two other people last July,” she says. “Our teacher was from Casablanca. I think he was only about 19. “In my work, when they see you know how to say things in their language and you’re interested in learning it they feel more valued and that you value their culture.” García Savalls is clear that the scheme is as much about building self-esteem, saying that the participants often don’t value their own language because it’s seen as inferior to European languages. “And yet, after Catalan and Spanish, Amazigh is the third most widely spoken language in Catalonia.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Barcelona’s pro-mother tongue project that inverts the classic rule of migration,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/20/prollema-barcelona-barcelonas-pro-mother-tongue-project-that-inverts-the-classic-rule-of-migration-catalan-spanish-amazigh
4/20/2022,"The former Los Angeles Lakers player, coach and general manager Jerry West has reportedly demanded an apology and retraction over his depiction in the HBO series Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty, calling it “a baseless and malicious assault”. The new drama series is centred on the rise of the LA Lakers in the 1980s “Showtime era”, when West was the team’s general manager. The actor Jason Clarke plays West, alongside John C Reilly as the team’s owner, Dr Jerry Buss. According to ESPN, a statement was sent to HBO and the show’s executive producer Adam McKay on Tuesday night by West’s legal team, who allege that the show “falsely and cruelly portrays Mr West as an out-of-control, intoxicated rage-aholic”, causing “great distress to Jerry and his family”. “Jerry West was an integral part of the Lakers and NBA’s success,” the letter continued. “It is a travesty that HBO has knowingly demeaned him for shock value and the pursuit of ratings. As an act of common decency, HBO and the producers owe Jerry a public apology and at the very least should retract their baseless and defamatory portrayal of him.” ESPN reported that the 83-year-old’s lawyers were asking for damages and a retraction within two weeks. In the letter, former players including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Cooper and Jamaal Wilkes, as well as Lakers employees who worked with West, have given statements denying they saw him commit the angry acts depicted in Winning Time or that they ever saw him drink alcohol at work. “Instead of exploring his issues with compassion as a way to better understand the man, they turn him into a Wile E Coyote cartoon to be laughed at,” Abdul-Jabbar wrote. “He never broke golf clubs, he didn’t throw his trophy through the window.” Mitch Kupchak, the former Lakers player and a close colleague of West’s, said he “never saw or heard Jerry lose his temper with anyone. I also never saw or heard Jerry go on an angry rant or tirade nor did I ever see or hear Jerry scream or yell at anyone. That was not his personality.” Winning Time is based on Jeff Pearlman’s book Showtime: Magic, Kareem, Riley, and the Los Angeles Lakers Dynasty of the 1980s. West’s lawyers alleged that the show’s creators acted with “malice” because scenes where West is shown to be angry were not in Pearlman’s book, and did not happen. “Contrary to the show, the book leaves readers with the true impression of Jerry as a brilliant and thoughtful GM,” they wrote. “Your extreme departure from the book shows malice in your false portrayal.” While the show has been a hit with audiences, former players and industry figures have been split. Earlier this week, Abdul-Jabbar, portrayed on the show by Solomon Hughes, criticised the show’s “crude stick-figure” characters in a blog post, and that West’s scenes “reek of facile exploitation of the man rather than exploration of character.” Gary Vitti, the former Lakers trainer, claimed he withdrew from a paid role as an “in-house expert” on the show because he didn’t like the portrayal of West’s character. “It was a total mischaracterisation of Jerry West,” he told the Athletic in March. McKay and other producers on Winning Time have spoken about the extensive research that went into the show and how it stemmed from their love for the Lakers. HBO has not yet responded to requests for comment. Earlier this month, the network renewed the series for a second season.",Arts/Television & radio,Jerry West demands retraction over ‘rage-aholic’ portrayal in Winning Time,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/20/jerry-west-demands-retraction-over-rage-aholic-portrayal-in-winning-time
4/20/2022,"Ashley Stayner is a self-professed true crime fan. She also happens to have a front row seat to two true crime narratives in her own family. Her father is abduction-victim-turned-hero Steven Stayner, the subject of the two-part television movie, I Know My First Name Is Steven, which aired in 1989. Her uncle is Carey Stayner, the serial killer currently sitting on death row for “the Yosemite murders,” which have been covered on numerous true crime programs like American Justice, FBI: Criminal Pursuit, How It Really Happened and more. “I grew up learning everything about my dad and his whole story through the media,” Ashley Stayner tells the Guardian. Her affection for true crime persists despite the exhaustive and invasive attention poured onto her family’s trauma. “It’s just interesting to know how the human mind works and how environment can turn somebody into what they are,” says Stayner, describing the genre’s appeal. “I think true crime shows that different side of what people can be.” Stayner, 36, has been speaking to the media from her home in Atwater, California, while gearing up for her own true crime debut in Captive Audience: A Real American Horror Story. The layered and self-aware three-part limited series, directed by Jessica Dimmock and executive produced by the Russo Brothers, returns to Stayner’s family’s stories while deconstructing how they have been told and processed; how authorship, artistic license and true crime tropes would play into the TV movie, and the how the news media would package Carey Stayner’s horrifying deeds in direct contrast to his younger brother’s earlier victimization and heroism. Steven Stayner was seven years old when he was abducted in 1972. He was held captive in a remote cabin and sexually abused for seven years. In 1980, Stayner’s abductor, Kenneth Parnell, kidnapped a second child: five-year-old Timmy White. Refusing to let White suffer as he had, 14-year-old Stayner escaped with young White. He was lauded for his brave actions, reunited with his family and became a long-time media obsession while coping with trauma he could barely speak to. He tragically died almost a decade later in a hit-and-run. Ashley Stayner, who was a pre-schooler at the time of her father’s death, has only faint memories of him. Stayner explains that she spent most of her childhood unfamiliar with his story, because her family avoided discussing it. “It wasn’t until I was in seventh grade that I really started understanding the complexity of everything,” says Stayner, referring to the period in 1999 when her uncle Carey Stayner murdered four women in Yosemite National Park. His heinous crimes dragged her family’s story back into the public consciousness. Captive Audience will naturally do the same. “Here’s a story that’s been told,” says Dimmock, acknowledging where her series stands in a long line of media that covered the Stayner family’s ordeals. “I just added to the pile.” But her take is the first to have family members involved, including Steven and Carey’s mother Kay Stayner. The latter provides visceral and devastating details from the years her younger son disappeared, recalling for instance how she would never leave the house unattended just in case Steven would call home, or how her husband Delbert would search soil that appeared freshly dug up or pursue any strange looking vehicles that he caught sight of on the highway, desperately hoping to find his son. “I’m always really drawn to things that are as close to the skin as possible,” says Dimmock. “I knew that I wanted to honor that this happened to a real family and that there was a lot of torment outside of the media attention.” While capturing these intimate testimonies, Dimmock also calls attention to herself and the storytelling apparatus built to record, edit and frame the people in Captive Audience. She includes the bits that are generally left on the cutting room floor, like Kay Stayner searching for a comfortable position beneath studio lighting as she emotionally prepares for a long and probing conversation with Dimmock, or her relaxing post-interview sigh, as if she can let her guard down. These are Dimmock’s reminders that she too is playing a role in packaging the Stayner’s narrative. And she invites questions about how that story has been shaped before. Captive Audience’s primary resources includes taped conversations between I Know My First Name Is Steven screenwriter JP Miller and network executives. Excerpts from those conversations are a telling peek behind the true crime curtain, explaining the elisions, rearrangements, cliff hangers, massaged facts and outright fictions the storytellers introduce into the narrative for the sake of the audience’s attention spans. In her series, Dimmock begs to consider the Stayner family as part of the audience, the most captive ones, which adds another layer to the show’s engagement with true crime as a genre. Rarely do we get to see the aftermath, how a family copes and struggles to readjust following a traumatic event that seized national media attention, and how they too absorb those on-screen depictions and narratives. In the series, Ashley Stayner admits that she would conflate her father with Corin Nemec, the actor who plays him in I Know My First Name Is Steven. “That’s the way your dad has been presented to you,” Dimmock says, speaking directly to Stayner. “I found those elements interesting.” The family also had to absorb the media’s especially loaded narratives following Carey Stayner’s crimes. Journalists eagerly ran with a theory that Carey Stayner committed murder and wanted to be caught because he was both jealous of the attention Steven got decades earlier and hurt by his parent’s neglect. Dimmock explains her sensitivity to the shifting sympathies, responding particularly to the ways that narrative cast Kay Stayner in a way different light, from the mother of a young hero to the woman who raised a perpetrator. “I have never really thought about what happens to the families of a perpetrator,” says Dimmock. “What do they experience? What do they go through? And honestly, I never really wanted to talk about that before, because why would I want to know that? But in this situation, I do care, because I know that they’ve been through something really hard. Don’t they deserve our sympathies?” Dimmock handles Kay Stayner’s story with a level of care that’s not typically afforded the subjects in true crime, a genre that can often be exploitative. A section in Captive Audience very briefly suggests a history of mental illness and sexual abuse within the Stayner family without delving any further. In the aftermath of Carey Stayner’s crimes, details emerged regarding his mental illness, the alleged abuse he suffered at the hands of an uncle and that his father allegedly molested his daughters. “I didn’t feel this was an opportunity to relitigate anything,” says Dimmock, explaining her decision to leave out the seemingly pertinent sexual abuse revelations, denying the audience the details they would typically expect in true crime. “I had the opportunity to sit down with the Stayners and hear their perspective. There’s a moment when I asked Kay Stayner if she wants to talk about Cary, and she says no. I didn’t have to include that. I wanted the audience to be aware of a boundary. “Kay says no, and we don’t go there.” Captive Audience: A Real American Horror Story is available on Hulu from 21 April with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘There was a lot of torment’: the family who endured two true crime stories,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/20/there-was-a-lot-of-torment-the-family-who-endured-two-true-stories
4/20/2022,"The contours of the race are becoming clearer: this election is being driven by fear. The early skirmishes are done with. The artillery is in play. A numbing bombardment of negative messaging. “Stop frightening pensioners!” demanded Scott Morrison on Tuesday, as Labor stepped up its claims of a secret Coalition plan to extend the cashless debit card to aged pensioners. Also known as the Indue card after the private company that administers it, the card is currently used in a series of trials where “high levels of welfare dependence coexist with high levels of social harm”. Such recipients cannot use the cards for gambling or liquor, or generally to withdraw cash. In practice, they can’t use them in secondhand stores, either. Despite an auditor general’s finding that the card has delivered no demonstrable “reduction in social harm”, the government has more than flirted with the idea of using the card more widely. This week, however, it ruled out any application to the age pension. “It’s an out-and-out disgusting lie,” said Morrison. But the prime minister is an expert at scaring pensioners. He probably owes his government to it. The Australian National University’s 2019 Election Study found the largest reason Labor voters gave for switching to the Coalition at the last election was the economy and “taxation”. That issue alone generated a 4.5% swing, overwhelming the slight shift from the Coalition to Labor by voters citing the environment (1.5%) or Medicare (1.0%) as their reason for doing so. In 2019, Morrison ran a relentless scare campaign about Labor’s “retiree tax” based on Bill Shorten’s promised reforms to franking credits. In the New South Wales seat of Cowper, a retirement belt between Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour with on average some of the oldest and poorest voters in the country, Morrison achieved twice the swing of the national average. So he can expect no mercy from Labor on its cashless pension card campaign. “We will not be stepping back from this important issue,” confirmed shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers on Monday. Labor knows there are no electoral virtues in being pure. Its 2016 “Mediscare” campaign, warning of a fictional Coalition plan to privatise public health, brought Malcolm Turnbull to the very edge of oblivion and guaranteed Shorten a second tilt. So pick your poison. Pensions, the NDIS, Medicare, open borders, Chinese Reds under Labor beds … it’s all getting a run. But if fear works, what is the cost? Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ANU study shows Australians’ “satisfaction with democracy” plunged from 86% in 2007 when Kevin Rudd was elected, to just 59% by the time of Morrison’s victory in 2019. An era of party coups and spectacularly abandoned promises has eroded trust at a time when everything negative, from misremembered jobless figures to unwanted handshakes, live on forever, cycled endlessly in the digital vortex. For this campaign, Labor has consciously limited its policy differences with the Coalition. But all that leaves are scare campaigns – and a beauty contest. The latter, also known as a horse race, seemed a pretty sure thing for Labor when the other runner was an unloved donkey with three years of lead in its saddlebags. And what lead! Rorts and scandals … unheld hoses … a nag who couldn’t stir itself to race for vaccines in the middle of a pandemic! Surely, all Labor needed was discipline and a new suit and glasses for the boss. So why is it proving so hard to put the other bugger away? For one thing, he has already won at the distance. Morrison also has three other advantages easily overlooked. In 2019, he was just eight months on from the epic bloodletting that tore his party apart. A subset of Liberals was mourning Turnbull, Peter Dutton had been humiliated, and high-profile ministers were making sometimes pointed departures. Chief among them, the other leadership contender Julie Bishop. None of that is a factor three years later. Also in Morrison’s favour is the electoral pendulum. Reset by distributions, Labor must defend eight seats on margins of less than 2%. It holds five seats on 1% or less. But to win outright, Labor needs to hold all of those and gain seven. That would require a uniform swing in its favour of at least 3.3%. The final factor is history. Since the second world war, “governments only change on big waves”, says Essential pollster Peter Lewis. That requires revulsion. Or excitement.

More money for aged care and childcare are doubtless welcome but there are no signs of specific savings to pay for them. There are no nation-building reforms. Not yet. Maybe something will come. Morrison, meanwhile, must extinguish any hint of excitement for change. In that, Albanese has unwittingly helped him by suppressing the larrikin wit that for so many years made him popular, at least among those who dealt with him. In his most famous speech he declared “I like fighting Tories. That’s what I do.” But he had friendly dealings with the other side of the aisle. And when he resigned his cabinet position to support the return of Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard made a rare exception and refused to accept it. Just when he needs it, there is little sign of that “Albo”, a genuine, not a confected Australian original. Horse race or beauty contest, the punters aren’t overjoyed by either runner. But vote they must. So, cue the fear.

4/20/2022,"Thousands of lives are being put at risk due to delays and disruption in diabetes care, according to a damning report that warns patients have been “pushed to the back of the queue” during the Covid-19 pandemic. There are 4.9 million people living with diabetes in the UK, and almost half had difficulties managing their condition last year, according to a survey of 10,000 patients by the charity Diabetes UK. More than 60% of them attributed this partly to a lack of access to healthcare, which can prevent serious illness and early mortality from the cardiovascular complications of diabetes, rising to 71% in the most deprived areas of the country. One in three had no contact with healthcare professionals about their diabetes in 2021, while one in six have still not had contact since before the pandemic, the report by the charity said. NHS figures show that just 36% of people with diabetes in England received all their recommended checks in 2020-21, compared with 57% in 2019-20. Diabetes UK said that while ministers have focused on tackling the elective surgery backlog, diabetes patients have lost out as a result, and there is now an urgent need to get services back on track before lives are “needlessly lost”. Chris Askew, the chief executive of Diabetes UK, called for a national diabetes recovery plan. “Diabetes is serious and living with it can be relentless,” he said. “If people with diabetes cannot receive the care they need, they can risk devastating, life-altering complications and, sadly, early death. “We know the NHS has worked tirelessly to keep us safe throughout the pandemic, but the impacts on care for people living with diabetes have been vast. While the UK government has been focused on cutting waiting lists for operations and other planned care, people with diabetes have been pushed to the back of the queue.” People with diabetes can live healthy lives, but if the condition is not managed well, high blood sugar levels, high blood pressure and high cholesterol can cause problems with the vascular system that can lead to serious complications. Every week diabetes leads to more than 190 amputations, 770 strokes, 590 heart attacks and more than 2,300 cases of heart failure. To reduce the risk of complications, patients must constantly self-manage their condition with support from healthcare professionals through routine care, including blood sugar measurement (HbA1c), foot checks, and blood pressure monitoring. Research shows that the delivery of these regular checks is associated with better health outcomes, including fewer deaths, and a reduction in emergency admissions and amputations. “We need to get this essential, life-saving care back on track, or lives will be needlessly lost,” said Askew. “Urgent action is now required, which is why we’re calling on the UK government to implement a recovery plan for diabetes care.” The report, published as part of the charity’s Diabetes is Serious campaign, also revealed that people from the most deprived parts of the country were nearly twice as likely to have had no contact with their healthcare team since before the pandemic than those in the least deprived. The former England footballer Gary Mabbutt, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for more than 40 years and is backing the campaign, said: “I know from my own experience that complications from diabetes can be absolutely devastating, taking a heavy toll on people with diabetes and those close to them. “For people with diabetes accessing vital care has been a huge challenge during the pandemic and continues to be as this report shows.” An NHS spokesperson said: “Diabetes care has remained a priority for the NHS throughout the pandemic, with thousands of people getting support through an expansion of online services and by providing life-changing technology to help people manage their condition. “The NHS is providing £36m to local areas to recover services and improve the lives of people living with or at risk of diabetes – this includes increasing the number of patients receiving all of their care checks and boosting referrals to the world-leading NHS diabetes prevention programme.”",News/Society,"Disruption to diabetes care during Covid threatens thousands, charity warns",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/20/disruption-to-diabetes-care-during-covid-threatens-thousands-charity-warns
4/20/2022,"She has become an instant heroine of the Republican right. In a 59-page opinion on Monday, the US district judge Kathryn Mizelle of Tampa, Florida, overturned the federal requirement that people wear masks on planes and public transportation. Congressman Byron Donalds hailed her “courage” and “common sense”. The far-right activist Jack Posobiec praised her as a “patriot”. Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union, tweeted: “God Bless Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle!” Mizelle’s decision triggered cheers and fears in the skies. Some passengers removed their masks with glee. Others thought the move hasty and questioned how a lone 35-year-old judge on the district court for the middle district of Florida could wield so much power over millions of lives. The answer lies partly in Donald Trump’s sweeping effort to reshape the judiciary, arguably his most profound legacy. Trump appointed 226 judges during his four years in office, including 54 powerful federal appellate judges. Mizelle – whose husband Chad Mizelle served as acting general counsel in the homeland security council during the Trump administration – is the youngest Trump appointee on the federal bench. She was 33 when she was nominated by Trump in September 2020 and confirmed in a party-line vote in the Senate, then controlled by Republicans, after Trump had lost his bid for re-election. Liberal activists warned at the time that Mizelle had a “stunning lack of legal experience” and an “extreme rightwing ideology”. The American Bar Association (ABA) rated her “not qualified”, in part because she had only eight years experience in practicing law. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, noted on Tuesday that the ABA “prefers a dozen years of practice experience and she had merely eight. “The ABA also voiced concern that Mizelle lacked experience in litigating and trying cases, a concern that she attempted to counter in her hearing. She was among 10 Trump nominees who earned that rating, eight of whom the Senate confirmed as life-tenured judges.” Despite such concerns, on Monday it fell to Mizelle to determine that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had exceeded its authority by issuing the original health order that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) used to impose its mask mandate. She said the CDC did not follow proper rule making procedures. Within hours all major US airlines and many airports announced – in some cases to passengers in the middle of flights – that travellers could take off their masks. A challenge to the ruling could still be possible. The CDC has said it will continue to study whether mask mandates are necessary, and the Biden administration said on Tuesday that it could appeal depending on the CDC’s findings. Christopher Kang, chief justice of the progressive group Demand Justice, said: “Kathryn Mizelle’s decision to substitute her own judgment for that of the Center for Disease Control is a stark reminder of the future we face if Democrats do not reform the courts: one in which Trump judges spend the next several decades kneecapping the ability of every Democratic president to govern. “Mizelle epitomises the Trump judge: someone chosen not for their qualifications, but for their commitment to enacting a partisan Republican agenda from the bench.” After graduating from law school in 2012, Mizelle worked at the justice department and in private practice at Jones Day. She also served as a law clerk for several federal judges plus Justice Clarence Thomas, widely regarded as the most conservative member of the supreme court. During her Senate confirmation, Senator Mike Lee of Utah described her as “exceptionally qualified”, adding: “It is unusual that I see an individual who has been out of law school for this period of time who has accumulated this much experience.” But the Leadership Conference of Civil and Human Rights opposed her confirmation. Its president, Vanita Gupta, described Mizelle as “woefully unprepared and unqualified to serve as a federal judge” and provided a list of her involvement in harming civil, LGBTQ, transgender and voting rights. Gupta wrote: “This nominee has been put forward not only because she is an ultraconservative ideologue, but also because she is a Trump loyalist, having worked in the Trump Justice Department to dismantle many critical civil rights protections.” She pointed out that Mizelle was an active member of the Federalist Society, which advocates for an originalist interpretation of the constitution and has spent decades working to shift America’s courts to the right. Mizelle is also an adjunct professor of law at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. While decisions by a federal judge typically affect only the people involved in one case, judges can also issue so-called nationwide or universal injunctions that apply across the country, as happened on Monday. Curt Levey, president of the conservative group Committee For Justice, said he supports Mizelle’s decision both on its own terms and as pushback against federal overreach on coronavirus safety regulations. “Liberals are unhappy that a single federal judge was able to end this mask mandate, but they are simply reaping what they sowed,” he wrote in an email. “The left’s hatred for President Trump led it to turn the federal courts into a national injunction machine that showed little deference to the executive branch or the limits on district court judges. Liberals now have to live with this new legal regime they brought about.” Levey added that the left’s unhappiness with the idea that a young judge appointed by President Trump could wield this power “really has nothing to do with her age and everything to do with her being a conservative appointed by a president they despise”.",News/US news,Trump-appointed judge triggers cheers and fears with US mask ruling,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/trump-judge-kathryn-mizelle-mask-mandate-coronavirus-covid
4/20/2022,"Donald Trump attempted a coup on 6 January 2021 as he tried to salvage his doomed presidency, and that will be a central focus of forthcoming public hearings of the special House panel investigating events surrounding the insurrection at the US Capitol, the congressman Jamie Raskin has said. Raskin is a prominent Democrat on the committee and also led the House efforts when Trump was impeached for a historic second time, in 2021, accused of inciting the storming of the US Capitol by his extremist supporters who were trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. “This was a coup organized by the president against the vice-president and against the Congress in order to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” Raskin said in an interview with the Guardian, Reuters news agency and the Climate One radio program. Public hearings by the bipartisan special committee investigating January 6 and related actions by Trump and his White House team and other allies, chaired by the Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, are expected next month. “We’re going to tell the whole story of everything that happened. There was a violent insurrection and an attempted coup and we were saved by Mike Pence’s refusal to go along with that plan,” said Raskin. He was referring to Trump’s vice-president, who went ahead in his role of overseeing the certification of Biden’s win, which was delayed until the early hours of the following day after Pence and other lawmakers, staff and journalists ended up running for their lives as rioters stormed the building, shortly after Trump held a rally near the White House exhorting his supporters to “fight like hell”. The November 2020 presidential election was deemed by experts at the local, state and federal level to have been “the most secure” in American history, with Trump’s attorney general Bill Barr also concluding that December that the result was accurate. Raskin told the Guardian, however, that the panel’s hearings would demonstrate to the American public the actions Trump, and the cohort who went along with his efforts, took to overturn the election result. If the attack on the Capitol had succeeded in preventing the certification of Biden as the incoming president, Raskin asserted that “Trump was prepared to seize the presidency and likely to invoke the insurrection act and declare martial law”. The insurrection resulted in death and injury to law enforcement and Raskin said that in addition to Pence’s stance against Trump’s demands, the democratic process that day was also saved by “the valor and the bravery of our officers who stood strong against the attempt to just overrun the whole process”. After a broad criminal investigation, about 800 people have been charged with crimes committed in relation to the Capitol attack. Raskin said: “We don’t have a lot of experience with coups in our own country and we think of a coup as something that takes place against a president.” However, January 6 was not what is typically regarded as a coup because it did not involve the military or another faction in society attacking the head of the government. “It’s what the political scientists call a self-coup … It’s a president fearful of defeat, overthrowing the constitutional process,” Raskin said. The Maryland congressman is also looking at the bigger, interrelated picture of American democracy and the climate crisis. “We’ve got to save the democracy in order to save the climate and save our species,” he told the Guardian, Reuters and Climate One in the interview, as part of the Covering Climate Now media collaboration.

4/20/2022,"After more than a decade spent considering myself a New Yorker I have finally left Manhattan for cheaper pastures (Philadelphia). I am, of course, obliged to tell you all about it. One does not get out of Metropolis quietly. No, ever since Joan Didion wrote Goodbye to All That in 1967, anyone who moves out of New York (or London) must file a Why I Left essay on their way out. It’s the law. And I’m very law-abiding. I’m also, luckily for you, on a strict word limit. Therefore I’m going to have to boil down my completely unique, never-before-experienced reflections on how the combination of having a new baby and living in a one-bedroom flat throughout the pandemic made me realise I wasn’t young enough or rich enough to have the sort of life I wanted in New York. And what sort of life did I want? The pandemic, middle age and motherhood made me figure out what was really important: having a washing machine in my house. They are surprisingly hard to come by in Manhattan. Happily, dreams do come true! For the price of a tiny hovel in NYC, I’ve just moved into a big old house with a washer and dryer in Philly. There’s even a garden where I could, hypothetically, air dry my clothes. This, by the way, is something Americans don’t do. They’re very weird about it. Some communities have even tried to ban people from drying their clothes outside, which gave rise to a whole right-to-dry movement. There are now safe states where you are legally protected if you want to air your clean laundry. I digress. I am not here to opine on the US’s odd relationship with laundry. I am here to say that I have made a very good life choice. “So much space, so much house,” I thought, when we moved in last week. Amazing! And then there was a leak in the basement and ants invaded the kitchen. Still, at least I have a big shiny washing machine. I loaded it up the other day and, with a little shiver of pleasure, pressed “start”. And guess what? The bloody thing is broken. There’s a lesson in there somewhere.

4/20/2022,"A Hong Kong court has sentenced a former radio DJ and political party official charged with “seditious” verbal crimes to 40 months in jail. Tam Tak-chi, also known by his radio name Fast Beat, was also fined $5,000 after he was found guilty on 11 of 14 charges against him last month, including seven counts of “uttering seditious words”. He was acquitted of two counts of “disorderly conduct in a public place,” and one of “conspiracy to utter seditious words.” Tam was the first person to be charged with sedition in Hong Kong since 1997, under a colonial-era law that authorities in the territory have used with increasing frequency since the crackdown began on pro-democracy protesters and supporters. The anti-sedition law is separate to the national security law introduced in 2019 which also criminalises acts as sedition, as well as terrorism, secession, and foreign collusion. The 50-year-old former vice-chair of the People Power party has been in jail since his September 2020 arrest. He had been arrested on a similar accusation in the January prior and released on bail. Prosecutors alleged that the activist used anti-police slogans as well as phrases commonly heard at the 2019 protests: “liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times” and “five demands, not one less” on multiple occasions. His trial saw the prosecution and defence debate the meaning of “liberate” and “revolution” throughout Chinese history. In a separate trial of the first person charged under the national security law, the court ruled the “liberate” phrase could be used to incite others to commit secessionist activities. Stanley Chan, the national security judge picked by Hong Kong’s government, sentenced Tam to a total of 54 months for the various charges, including two years for “incitement to knowingly take part in an unauthorised assembly”, but ruled several be served concurrently, reducing the total imprisonment to 40 months. Chan said he found no mitigating factors, and accused Tam of “grandstanding” and having a “subjective wish” to stand for and win the then-planned legislative election. Tam is among 47 campaigners, activists and politicians who were arrested and detained over a pre-election primary. The democratic caucus later resigned in protest, and the electoral system was overhauled to largely make it impossible for opposition camps to win. Maya Wang, Human Rights Watch’s senior China researcher, said Tam’s sentence “exemplifies the dizzying speed at which Hong Kong’s freedoms are being eroded”. “Once known as Asia’s protest capital, Hong Kong is now sentencing people to years in prison simply for shouting slogans.”",News/World news,Hong Kong jails pro-democracy activist and former DJ for ‘uttering seditious words’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/hong-kong-jails-pro-democracy-activist-and-former-dj-for-uttering-seditious-words
4/20/2022,"A hot air balloon on its maiden flight with 12 people on board made an emergency landing in a Melbourne street. Emergency services were called to an Elwood property about 7.20am on Wednesday to find a balloon draped over two rooftops and the basket in the yard and car park. Fire Rescue Victoria’s high angle rescue technicians were brought in to remove the deflated balloon. Police and SES volunteers were also at the scene. No one was injured. This is what it was like for those on board the hot air balloon that made a crash landing in Elwood this morning. The basket hits a building before crashing into the trees. (Language warning) @9NewsMelb pic.twitter.com/X4xDCQCJCw The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating, interviewing the pilot and passengers and taking the balloon for examination. Nick Brau, the chief pilot for Liberty Balloon Flights, told radio 3AW the balloon was on its maiden journey. It flew for about half an hour but struggled to get in the air properly. He said the incident was “a bit embarrassing” and there was a malfunction he could not explain. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The valve that releases hot air from the top, which we use to manoeuvre the balloon, didn’t seal properly,” Brau told 3AW. “So I was losing a lot of heat and it was difficult to keep the balloon up in the air so that’s why I was flying low and I was aiming for the beach but we didn’t make it for about 200 metres.” Karen, a passenger, was on board with her family for her daughter’s birthday and said the basket bumped the tops of a few buildings on the way down. She told ABC radio Brau did an amazing job landing the balloon on the small suburban street. “He missed the powerlines, he missed the cars, some big elm trees that [were] buffeted at our fall, so we didn’t come down too aggressively, although it was, you know, quite a thud,” Karen said. “But nobody was hurt, he was incredibly calm. He did an amazing job, really.” Chris Kessaris, the owner of the pet grooming store Petiquette by Caroline, was two doors down from where the hot air balloon eventually touched down. While Kessaris didn’t see the incident directly, he was surprised to find a sizeable amount of straw in the backyard when he arrived this morning to work. “There’ve been heaps of people gathering around,” he said. Despite being in the balloon’s flight path, Kessaris wasn’t surprised by the affair. He said there were “always dramas” with hot air balloons in the area. “Chris from Petiquette definitely won’t be getting his arse in a hot air balloon, and you can quote me on that,” he said of the incident. “We’ve seen them two metres above the water out where they do the kite surfing in St Kilda.” “There are always dramas with them, they’re always flying low to the floor, I’ve had it on my Instagram a few times.”",News/Australia news,Hot air balloon crash lands on Melbourne rooftops,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/hot-air-balloon-crash-lands-on-melbourne-rooftops
4/20/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has fended off accusations that he is responsible for “the worst Australian foreign policy failure” in the Pacific since the end of the second world war after the Solomon Islands struck a new security pact with China. Labor has seized on the new agreement as evidence that Australia has been asleep at the wheel while China has cemented its influence in the region, with leader Anthony Albanese saying more should have been done to prevent it from going ahead. The Coalition last week dispatched the minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja, to Honiara, where he “respectfully” asked the Solomon Islands prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, to consider not signing the proposed security agreement with China. But his appeal fell on deaf ears, with Sogavare confirming to the country’s parliament on Wednesday that the pact had been signed, but saying he did not believe it would affect the “peace and harmony of our region”. Morrison defended sending Seselja instead of the foreign minister, Marise Payne, who Sky News reported was hosting a fundraiser in Sydney at the time. “The judgement was made not to engage at a foreign-minister level engagement to ensure that Australia’s views were communicated very clearly and very respectfully,” Morrison said. “I’m very conscious of how visits are perceived within the Pacific. This was the right, calibrated way to address this issue with the prime minister. “One of the things you don’t do in the Pacific is you don’t throw your weight around. They’re a sovereign country and we have to respect their sovereignty.” But Albanese said Australia’s relationship with the Solomon Islands was of crucial strategic importance and criticised the government for failing to act after being warned last August that the deal was imminent. “No visit from the foreign minister, no visit from the defence minister, no engagement in a serious way with prime minister Sogavare,” Albanese said. “Whether it’s the bushfires, whether it’s ordering enough vaccines, whether it’s ordering rapid antigen tests, whether it’s responding to the floods, this prime minister is complacent. He’s always there for the photo-op, never there for the follow-up, never does the right planning to get ahead of issues.” The Solomon Islands opposition leader, Matthew Wale, told the ABC last month that he had warned Australian officials in August last year about the potential deal and was disappointed in the response. Wale is now calling for Sogavare to make public the text of the agreement, which the US has criticised as a “shadowy deal” that had been struck with little regional consultation. Under sustained questioning about the government’s approach to the Solomon Islands deal on Wednesday, Morrison said the move by China was not a surprise to the government. “What it highlights is there is always incredible pressure on Pacific nations that comes from China seeking to undermine the security of the region ... so we have focused very much on the Pacific because we know the risks, and I think what we have seen there highlights those risks,” the prime minister said. “We can’t always prevent them in all circumstances, [and] the sort of pressure and influence that has been seeking to be exerted in our region is very real. “That’s why for many, many years now we have been seeking to resist this, and had we not done that then I fear that we would have seen even more significant events take place.” At a later press conference, Morrison also sought to turn criticism back to Labor, saying the opposition had been “very passive” when it came to the risk presented by China and our region.

While Sogavare has explicitly ruled that out, this has done little to ease the fears of security officials in Canberra and in Washington. On Monday, the White House said a high-level US delegation, including Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell, would travel to Honiara this week to discuss concerns about China, as well as the reopening of a US embassy. In a statement on Wednesday, the US embassy in Canberra said that it was concerned that the agreement could undermine a “free and open” Indo Pacific. “In particular, we have concerns over the agreement’s lack of transparency, as well as its apparently vague and expansive provisions.” Visiting Singapore, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Adern, said that while the Solomon Islands was free to make its own sovereign decisions, it had previously agreed through the Pacific Island forum to discuss defence matters before making such decisions. “We have continued to reiterate with the Solomons and China our view alongside the Pacific: that collectively we are ready and available to meet the security needs of our neighbours,” Ardern said. “We are concerned about the militarisation of the Pacific and we continue to call on the Solomons to work with the Pacific with any concerns around their security they may have.” But Sogavare told Parliament that the deal would allow it to “build up and strengthen our police capability” to deal with any future instability. “The Solomon Islands-People’s Republic of China security cooperation is based on mutual respect for sovereignty and in compliance with domestic and international law,” he said. “Let me assure the people of Solomon Islands that we entered into an arrangement with China with our eyes wide open, guided by our national interests.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison fends off claim Solomon Islands-China pact is worst foreign policy failure since 1945,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/scott-morrison-fends-off-claim-solomon-islands-china-pact-is-worst-foreign-policy-failure-since-1945

4/20/2022,"The father of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has touted the possible election of a Labor government as a “great opportunity” for the movement to free the WikiLeaks founder from imprisonment. Speaking at a Sydney Q&A screening of documentary Ithaka, which documents his efforts to free Assange, John Shipton said a groundswell of parliamentarian support was growing for his son’s plight and he was buoyed up by the prospect of an incoming Labor government. “Of course things would change [if Labor were elected] … this is a great opportunity for us,” he said. “A fresh parliament has a lot of room to move … I speak to many of them. They don’t want this hanging around their neck like an albatross.” Shipton said he had had several lunches with Anthony Albanese, and had been assured the opposition leader would do “whatever he can” to free his son and “enough’s enough”. The 76-year-old said when he began advocating for Assange in 2019, two parliamentarians supported him – independent MP Andrew Wilkie and Greens senator for Tasmania Peter Whish-Wilson. “Now there are 29 and peripherally, there are other supporters,” he said. “The deputy prime minister while in the US … said publicly … that Julian ought to be charged if he’s done anything in the UK … other than that, send him home. “There’s a core in the Labor party, there’s a core in the National party, the Greens are all supporting [Julian] … it’s a popular concern and parliamentarians recognise that.” In December, Liberal backbenchers Jason Falinski and Bridget Archer called for diplomatic action to secure Assange’s return to Australia after Barnaby Joyce said it was unfair the US wanted to extradite him to face prosecution over actions allegedly not committed inside the US. There are currently 25 members of the Assange parliamentary group, including nine Greens, eight Labor, four independents or crossbench and four from the Coalition: Joyce, Bridget Arthur, Jason Falinski and Nationals MP George Christensen. Appearing alongside Assange’s brother and producer of Ithaka, Gabriel Shipton, and director, Ben Lawrence, Shipton said the Australian government had “no leverage” on an international scale while Assange remained imprisoned. “They want to be able to say to people when they travel overseas that they look after Australians, they repaired the problems of Julian Assange’s persecution,” he said. “He’s morally destroyed, physically destroyed … the continuation of policy which might merely be acquiescence over the unfolding of time becomes complicit. It’s inescapable, and cruel, and demotes ourselves, but we can fix it.” Filmed across the UK, Europe and the US, Ithaka follows the two-year struggle of John Shipton, a retired builder, and Assange’s wife, Stella Moris, to free Assange from US government efforts to try him in connection with WikiLeaks’ publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables. Shipton began seriously advocating for Assange at 73 years of age, after expressing initial unease at interacting with the media. He has a well-documented, complicated relationship with his son, absent from Assange’s life after the age of three and reconnecting with him in his 20s. Ithaka – the name of the film – comes from the title of Greek poet C.P. Cavafy’s epic poem which evokes the first step of a meaningful, lifelong journey. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Assange’s brother, Gabriel Shipton, said the idea for the documentary was sparked by a visit with his brother in 2019. Assange had recently been transferred to British prison Belmarsh after US legal action to extradite him to face trial on espionage charges. Since being transferred to the high-security prison, Assange’s physical and mental health significantly declined. “I went … to see him and Julian was being kept in ‘the hell wing’ of the prison … for the most desperately suicidal … they were basically kept in their cells 23 hours a day,” Gabriel Shipton said. “I left the prison that day thinking I’d never seen him like that, and I felt I wouldn’t see him again. “I started to think what can I do … and one way … was telling a different side of the story. We learn about Julian through the headlines … and see him in interviews but we don’t understand him through the eyes of the people who love him.” Last month, Assange’s case edged closer to a US trial on espionage charges after the UK’s highest court refused to hear his appeal against extradition. A spokesperson for Anthony Albanese said there was no further comment from his office as the opposition leader’s support for Assange was a matter of public record.",News/Australia news,"Change of government would present ‘great opportunity’ in fight to free Julian Assange, his father says ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/change-of-government-would-present-great-opportunity-in-fight-to-free-julian-assange-his-father-says
