4/22/2022,"More than seven in 10 people in England have been infected with Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to the Office for National Statistics. The estimate, the most detailed analysis to date, suggests 71% of people in England had caught Covid between 27 April 2020 and 11 February 2022. The proportion is likely to have risen further in the most recent Omicron wave, during which there was the highest prevalence at any time in the pandemic, including in older age groups that had previously had relatively low rates of infection. Prof James Naismith, the director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, said: “The total number of infected people was rising rapidly when the data stopped. The bottom line is the majority of people in the UK have had Covid-19.” The analysis used a sample of 535,116 people who completed one or more tests as part of the UK coronavirus infection survey (CIS), which covers people over the age of two years living in private households. Slightly lower proportions of the population were estimated to have been infected in Wales (56%) and Scotland (52%), but the figures are not directly comparable as the data covered a shorter time period, with Welsh data starting in June 2020 and Scotland in September 2020. In Northern Ireland, 72% of the population were estimated to have been infected. Duncan Cook, the deputy director for the Covid-19 infection survey, said: “Today’s release is a valuable piece of the puzzle for understanding the impact of the pandemic across the UK.” The analysis suggested that by October 2021, about one in three people in England had been infected and the proportion remained lower than a half until the emergence of the Omicron variant, which triggered a rapid rise in cases. The proportions infected are likely to be even higher than the ONS estimates as in the most recent Covid wave, which coincided with the lifting of restrictions, there was a surge in the number of cases in the oldest age groups. “In some regions of England today I would predict the portion of those who have had Covid-19 will easily exceed 80%,” said Naismith. The findings come as the latest ONS survey shows Covid rates are continuing to fall across the UK, with about 3,218,700 people in England – one in 17 - having Covid in the week ending 16 April, down from about one in 15 the week before. Decreases were also seen in Wales (one in 15), Northern Ireland (one in 30) and Scotland (one in 19) and across all age groups. “We continue to see a welcome decrease in infections across England, Northern Ireland and Scotland in today’s data. For the first time in several weeks, we are also seeing a decrease in Wales too,” said Cook. “It’s encouraging to see that infections have decreased in all age groups across England. Despite the decrease in infections, it’s important to note that levels remain high. We continue to monitor these going forward.” According to the latest government figures, the number of Covid patients in hospital and the number of weekly deaths linked to Covid is also falling in the UK.",News/World news,"Seven in 10 people in England have had Covid, research shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/seven-in-10-people-in-england-have-had-covid-research-shows-omicron
4/22/2022,"Like all truly patriotic Britons, I hugely enjoy how mad Prince Harry makes some people. Mad in both the British and American senses of the word. More than two years after he stepped back from royal duties to become yet another boring Californian, seemingly every utterance of Harry’s induces proper steam-out-of-the-ears stuff in a whole demographic of British people who insist they never want to hear another word from him – yet absolutely refuse to simply stop reading about him. Is HRH doing it on purpose, like some clever, extremely high-status troll? That’s a nice idea, but feels unlikely. The Windsors have never exactly been fabled for their intellects. It’s possible the situation is actually extremely uncomplicated: Prince Harry just wibbles out some stuff every now and then, at which point millions of grownups are completely unable to handle it. Either way, the Duke of Sussex’s latest act of treason seems to have been calling in on the Queen on the way to his Invictus Games for disabled former soldiers, held this week in the Netherlands. Not only did Harry later reveal that he and his grandmother had had a good-humoured tea – decried as oversharing by the sort of former aides who lucratively betrayed all his mother’s secrets – but he explained he’d been “making sure that she’s protected and got the right people around her”. Can’t be sure what he’s on about. Perhaps he saw the Queen being walked to her Westminster Abbey seat at Prince Philip’s memorial by the Duke of York, about 10 minutes after she’d forked out for some of his multimillion-dollar sex assault case settlement, and wondered if she was being advised by some kind of paedo Oliver Cromwell. Whatever the import of Harry’s comment, though, it has caused a huge number of pants to be wet, and whole fleets of prams to be emptied of toys. You cannot move for corpulent royal experts hissing about it all as they bank another appearance fee, while Britain’s leading body language authority wheels herself out to explain that Kate and William look “subdued” because of the “emotional exhaustion” she reckons was caused either by Harry, or by the fact they were visiting a Ukraine charity. (What a huge amount the rigorous science of body language can tell us.) However, in a country where millions act as if they know the Queen socially, people were always going to claim their chief concern was for the monarch, who celebrated her 96th birthday this week. “How CAN he do this to the Queen?” they always demand, apparently unwilling to realise that anyone who really cared about the Queen’s supposed feelings would simply avoid making it worse by ranting about the situation on every available airwave. That would surely be the most civilised course of action. After all, if a real-life friend of ours has an irksome relative we regard as potentially upsetting to them, we don’t spend their birthday wanging on about him. So the logic escapes me. If newspapers and TV pundits were simply trying to sell clickbaity content to be consumed by messy bitches who live for the drama, that would be one thing. But nothing – nothing! – could be further from the noble truth. As they never tire of telling us, they utterly REVERE the Queen. In which case, surely they should conduct themselves with a baseline level of social tact? The true, committed royalist would ignore Harry’s pronouncements completely. We ignore most of the other Californians; it can’t be beyond our famous British reserve. As close personal strangers to the Queen, we know the one thing of which we can be absolutely sure is that she wouldn’t want a fuss about it all. Yet a fuss is endlessly made. No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible, as the saying goes, but maybe the provisional wing of the Elizabeth II fandom ought to suppress the urge to call in furiously to a phone-in, or post furiously online, in order to spare this 96-year-old woman the endless drama? If not, I’m not sure how much longer we can keep taking lectures in duty and service from people too emotionally incontinent to prevent themselves being exercised by a Dan Wootton article. If they can’t commit to ignoring Prince Harry’s supposedly incendiary pronouncements, it’s past time for every single one of them to admit to themselves the truth: that they love the drama of the royal soap opera, and relish every new half-baked opportunity to re-enter the outrage cycle. As I say, I myself adore it. I am completely with the Bloomsbury group diarist Frances Partridge, who characterised people’s reaction to the death of George VI as “richly revelled-in emotional unbuttoning”. “What the public is feeling is a sense of great drama,” she noted, “not at all unpleasant.” Well quite. What a sadness, then, that the great British public remains too repressed to acknowledge this as far as Prince Harry is concerned. Instead, many feel more comfortable using the feelings of the Queen as a figleaf, at the same time as taking none of those feelings into account. So as she enters her 97th year, one of the greatest public services Her Majesty performs is serving as the proxy for all sorts of desires and impulses that her people lack the honesty and self-awareness to admit. What an exhausting job that must be at her age – but of course her heartless “fans” will never permit her to retire.

4/22/2022,"The provocations and final controversial coup de théâtre in Jackie Sibblies Drury’s play Fairview divided audiences though few could have been left indifferent to it. Marys Seacole has the same flamboyant theatricality but ends up paler and less potent by comparison, though it has to be commended for its fearlessness and desire to do something different. Perhaps it is just that desire, overegged, that scuppers its effects. Directed by Fairview’s Nadia Latif, it is based on the life of the 19th-century British-Jamaican nurse and hotelier Mary Seacole. A superstar in her time, she combined western practices with the herbalism she learned from her Caribbean mother. Her adventuring life included volunteering on the frontline of the Crimean war and healing the sick during the cholera epidemic. She is made gloriously flesh and blood by Kayla Meikle, a magnetic force who speaks in patois (or “patwah” as it is written in the script). Meikle keeps us hanging on her every word as she narrates a story that jumbles up character and chronology on Tom Scutt’s non-naturalistic stage, but does not carry a big enough payoff. The cast as a whole excels, playing multiple parts with deliberately overblown emotions and archness. We begin in satirical mode, at an NHS hospital, by the bedside of an elderly white woman (Susan Wooldridge), whose middle-class daughter (Olivia Williams) makes demands on two black nurses, while her granddaughter (Esther Smith) throws teenage strops. The curtain lifts to reveal another set, another curtain. Scenes zigzag and splice past with present, from Seacole’s 19th-century hotel in Kingston to a modern American playground and then Crimea. There is a sense of watching Seacole but also, in her transformations, seeing other Mary Seacoles down the ages, from childminders to NHS nurses, whose work goes unrecognised. The play makes its bigger point about the racial outsourcing of care for the sick, elderly people and children through satire. There is a rather too flat interplay between patronising white middle-class women and Black carers and the humour between them is sometimes amusing, but too obvious and repeated. It is when the drama travels to more outlandish set-ups that the humour comes to life: there is a comic training day for nurses that enacts a terrorist attack, and an icy exchange between Florence Nightingale and Seacole (Nightingale’s team refused to take Seacole’s offer of help during the Crimean war) in which Nightingale is in a boned skirt of enormous proportions, behaving with queenly arrogance on the battlefield. Ominous music by Xana builds a sense of dread with its rumble and thrum of bass, and the comedy threatens to slip into something darker. This darkness manifests fully in act two when we enter the realm of surreal fantasy and horror. Characters buckle, keen and repeat old lines. The stage looks like a wreckage of its parts, as in Fairview (there is even a plastic chicken that looks suspiciously like a prop from that play). Seacole’s mother (Llewella Gideon) appears as a vision and speaks all the play’s messages about race and the outsourcing of care: “Them need us but them nah want us.” Like Fairview, this metaphoric burning up of the story and the stage pulls the rug from under our feet. Here, though, it does not seem to be a dismantling of the story for greater purpose but a dramatic meltdown that resembles an experimental psychodrama – bizarre, mystifying, melodrama that we watch rather than feel. The point about care and economic slavery is a crucial one, but the mother’s diatribe takes in the entire breadth of “white man terror” (from white supremacy to police violence) and it feels like a play speaking aloud all the racial ills of society in one gasping breath, using this character, and its finale, as a mouthpiece. It also leaves us with a sense that the figure of Mary Seacole is a vehicle used to explore our current-day issues too nakedly rather than a study of a singular life and its forgotten achievements. Marys Seacole is at the Donmar Warehouse, London, until 4 June.",Arts/Stage,Marys Seacole review – mystifying drama about caring through the ages,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/22/marys-seacole-review-donmar-warehouse-london

4/22/2022,"Simon Middleton has issued a warning to his newly installed New Zealand counterpart, Wayne Smith, suggesting that experience coaching men’s rugby does not necessarily translate in the elite women’s game. Smith, a former All Blacks coach and widely considered one of the most astute minds in the sport, has been appointed director of rugby of the Black Ferns six months out from a home World Cup. The former All Blacks scrum coach Mike Cron has also been brought in, as has the 2011 World Cup winning coachSir Graham Henry in a supporting role. All three were involved in the 2011 triumph, but Middleton is not convinced their appointments will yield immediate success. “I don’t know how much Wayne or Mike or any of the others have worked in the women’s game,” said England’s head coach as the Red Roses prepare for this weekend’s Six Nations game against Ireland. “Their knowledge part is obviously huge but the men’s and women’s programmes are very different, it takes time to get to understand the best ways of working. “Just in terms of how you message, how you deliver coaching messages and different strategies. The men’s culture compared to the women’s culture within the squad is very different. It’s just a different psyche, a different approach. It will be interesting for them because it is very different.” On the communication front, Smith has work to do. In a radio interview he described his squad as girls with “shining eyes” and also suggested cultural change was not needed within the camp, despite a recent review that ended with his predecessor’s resignation reporting instances of favouritism, body-shaming and cultural insensitivity in New Zealand women’s rugby.

The reigning world champions were soundly beaten by England in November, losing their two matches by an aggregate score of 99-27. A chasm exists between the Black Ferns and the Red Roses but Middleton welcomes the fresh challenge. “It’s fantastic that they’ve recognised just how critical the competition is,” Middleton said of the new coaching set-up. “They’ve made very strong, very bold moves to make sure they’re as competitive and get their programme as close to where they want it as they can possibly be. It’s brilliant for the World Cup.” While New Zealand have taken a forward step, Ireland have gone in the opposite direction in terms of commitment to the XV-a-side game. England’s next Six Nations opponents will be without eight players – including all their outside backs who started in their last match against Italy – after they were called up to take part in the World Rugby Sevens Series in Canada. Middleton, by contrast, has named his strongest possible team. “I think it’s a shame because they were going really well,” Middleton said of Ireland who have effectively killed any chance of a contest well before kick-off. “We’ll keep our eyes on ourselves. Our responsibility is to perform as well as we can.” A record crowd for a Red Roses home game is expected in Leicester on Sunday and they will cheer on one of their own as county-born Emily Scarratt plays her 100th Test, becoming the eighth player, male or female, to reach this milestone for England. “There’s nothing she can’t do,” Middleton gushed. “If the situation was right she’d be the first million pound player because that’s how good she is. The quality that she has in her play is phenomenal. How she dealt with what was a horrendous injury is incredible. The touches she has in a game, the influence she has on a game, she’s the ultimate big-game player.” Leanne Infante will play her 50th game at scrum-half and Helena Rowland moves to full-back with Holly Aitchison partnering Scarratt in midfield. A formidable pack with 491 caps between them is bolstered by the return of the world player of the year Zoe Aldcroft at second row.",Sport/Sport,England’s Simon Middleton issues warning to new Black Ferns coach Smith,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/simon-middleton-black-ferns-coach-wayne-smith-womens-rugby-union
4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has said he will close loopholes to ensure UK exports to India cannot end up being used in Russian weapons, as he conceded the war in Ukraine could go on until the end of next year, and Russia could win. Speaking in Delhi at the end of a two-day visit, the UK prime minister warned that Vladimir Putin was resorting to a “grinding approach” in Ukraine; and suggested the UK would help to “backfill” countries including Poland if they provided heavy weaponry such as tanks to Kyiv. Johnson was asked a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), warning that India was one of a number of major routes for smuggling arms to Vladimir Putin’s regime. He pointed to the ban on exporting technology products to Russia, saying: “We want to ensure we keep that tight. We’ll be making sure that we don’t allow any loopholes of any kind … we will take steps to make sure that stuff doesn’t go through other routes to Russia.” Hours before the Rusi analysis was published, the government announced it would ease arms exporting licensing arrangements with New Delhi by issuing an open general export licence to India, hailing closer defence cooperation as one of the wins from the prime minister’s two-day trip. The report from Rusi, a 26-page overview of Russia’s military situation, says western economic sanctions mean Moscow will become increasingly reliant on component-smuggling to ensure its jets, missiles and other hi-tech munitions can function. Some components have a dual civilian and military use. Its authors, Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, warn that “Russia has established mechanisms for laundering these items through third countries”, and they argue that India should be subject to specific restrictions. “Restricting access, therefore, likely means preventing export to countries such as India of goods that are in some instances used for civilian purposes,” the two write. They add: “Moreover, there are myriad companies based around the world, including in the Czech Republic, Serbia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, India and China who will take considerable risks to meet Russia supply requirements.” Labour’s shadow defence secretary, John Healey, accused Johnson of going on “a vanity trip”, and urged him to do more to press India to clamp down on exports that could be used in defence. “Boris Johnson’s vanity trip to India was designed to distract from his law-breaking and failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. But he can use this report to help halt the Russian war in Ukraine. He must press for urgent action from prime minister Modi to clamp down on weapons parts passing through India and into Russian hands,” he said. Asked about briefings from western intelligence figures suggesting the Ukraine conflict could go on for many more months, and may result in a Russian victory, Johnson said: “The sad thing is that that is a realistic possibility. “Of course, Putin has a huge army. He has a very difficult political position because he’s made a catastrophic blunder, so that the only option he now has really is to try to use his appalling, grinding approach, led by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down.” Johnson said Putin was close to securing Mariupol – but he paid tribute to the resistance of Ukrainians: “No matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months – and I agree it could be a long period – he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people.” He announced that the UK would reopen its embassy in Kyiv next week, and suggested more ministers could follow his lead and visit the Ukrainian capital in the coming weeks. And he suggested the UK could send weaponry to neighbouring countries who could provide Ukraine with arms. “We are looking at sending to tanks to Poland to try to help them as they send some of their T72s [tanks] to Ukraine,” he said. Johnson discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with Modi when the pair held bilateral talks on Friday morning. India’s foreign secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, told reporters Johnson put “no pressure” on Modi over the issue. Delivering a statement alongside Johnson on Friday, Modi called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Ukraine, and emphasised the importance of diplomacy, but did not criticise Russia, which is India’s biggest supplier of arms. India has abstained from successive United Nations motions condemning Russia, and continues to buy Moscow’s oil. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, met Modi in Delhi this month, and insisted the two countries would continue to find ways to trade, despite western sanctions on Russia.",News/Politics,Johnson vows to stop UK exports to India ending up in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/johnson-vows-to-stop-uk-exports-to-india-ending-up-in-russia
4/22/2022,"There’s an old cine film of me from the early 70s, aged six: I’m standing on a dusty road near Guadalajara, squinting into the sun; my shadow is starting to lengthen behind me, as are those of the agave plants in fields abutting the mountains that encircle the city. The plants are already taller than I am, even though they have another three years to go before they are ready to be harvested and turned into Mexico’s most famous drink – tequila. The story of tequila is one of time. The finest, authentic tequila is made from just two ingredients: blue weber agave and water. It takes between seven and 10 years for each blue weber agave plant (a type of succulent native to the Jalisco region) to reach maturity before it is harvested by hand by farmers (jimadores) who work from dawn till noon to avoid the sun’s heat, using their coas (razor-sharp, long-handled blades) to detect when the agave is ready for harvesting. “The el Jimador process begins with a long wait,” says Ruben Aceves, global brand ambassador for Casa Herradura. “All of our tequilas start with the same process: blue weber agave plants are carefully harvested, cooked and milled to extract all the sweet, pleasant juices, which are then naturally fermented and distilled.” Just like champagne and stilton cheese, tequila has protected status. This means genuine tequila can only be produced in five states of Mexico: Nayarit, Guanajuato, Michoacan, Tamaulipas and Jalisco. The latter is where 99% of the spirit is created – fitting, as it’s also home to the town of Tequila. The other main rule is that tequila needs to contain at least 51% blue weber agave – with the best examples made from 100% blue weber agave by experts who understand that the only other things needed are water, expertise and a little patience. “Forget about shots with lime and salt; those days should be over,” says Aceves. “By drinking authentic 100% blue weber tequila quickly, people are missing the joy of sipping an incredible spirit with a lot of character.” There are three main types of tequila – all made from the same base liquid: blanco, reposado and añejo. Blanco – a clear liquid – is ready after less than two months in a neutral oak barrel, and is commonly used to make cocktails; reposado – which means rested – will go into a 200-litre white American oak barrel for two months to gain colour and more complex flavours, such as vanilla, caramel, a hint of toasted oak and a flash of citrus. And finally there’s añejo – meaning aged – which matures in the barrel for one to three years, resulting in a rich, dark, golden liquid, perfect for fans of cognac and brandy. For those who want to move away from shots, but aren’t sold on sipping tequila straight, the answer is simple: cocktails. “With a good-quality tequila, you can enjoy a variety of different cocktails,” says Aceves, explaining that tequila’s flexibility is its great advantage. “It can be blended with pretty much any mixer, juice or liqueur.” Most of us are familiar with the margarita – deservedly one of the world’s most popular cocktails – but that is far from the only option. “El Jimador Blanco is a very nice option for gin drinkers,” says Aceves, suggesting we prepare an el Jimador martini straight up or mixed with club soda, or a T&T (tequila and tonic) – letting the tequila sit with a twist of lemon or lime skin before adding the ice and tonic water. If, like me, you’re a reposado fan, I’d suggest replacing the lemon or lime with clementine or tangerine peel to complement the more complex flavours of aged tequila. However, for a true taste of Mexico, it’s all about the Paloma – the country’s national cocktail. Made with fresh grapefruit juice or grapefruit soda, lime juice, and most often blanco tequila (although some mixologists do use reposado), this is a cocktail to drink on a sunny day with friends. “To me, a Paloma represents the simple and wonderful alchemy often present in Mexican drinks, where you take a simple set of ingredients and turn them into something delicious,” says Lily Ramirez-Foran, a Mexican cook and author of Tacos. “A Paloma is a celebration of citrus flavours; it is summery, refreshing and relatively simple to make. “And yes, good tequila should be treated like good whisky,” she adds. “You take your time and sip it slowly, appreciating the flavours and craft that went into its making.” So there we have it; whether you choose to have it straight over ice or in a fruity cocktail, the only incorrect way to drink tequila is quickly.

4/22/2022,"Everybody loves a burrito, right? Fajitas, enchiladas and nachos are all regular fixtures on many British dinner tables. But while we might think we know Mexican cuisine, the truth is we should probably all broaden our horizons beyond the familiar routine of tortilla, meat, cheese, repeat. Spanning nearly 200m hectares (770,000 sq miles) of varying landscape and reflecting a stew pot of influences from ancient Mayan and Aztec cultures to Spanish, Asian and African cuisines, real Mexican food is bold, bright and complex. Here are seven authentic ingredients guaranteed to elevate your next Taco Tuesday. TomatilloAt first glance, this dinky green fruit looks a little like a small unripe tomato. Native to Mexico and Central America, they’re even nicknamed “husk tomatoes’’, thanks to the dry leaves that encircle them like paper lanterns. But tomatillos have a flavour all of their own; bright, summery and almost citrussy in their tartness, making them the perfect addition to a salsa verde or a zingy spin on guacamole. Roasting tomatillos mellows their acidic quality and brings out a little sweetness, while adding them to stews, chillies and soups will give an exciting tang to your standard Mexican repertoire. Thinly sliced, drizzled in oil and spiked with lime, chilli, coriander and salt, they’re even perfect on toast. You can buy them tinned, but it’s worth hunting out the real deal if you can – or even grow them yourself, and enjoy the taste of verdant greenery right on into autumn. AchioteNative to the tropical areas of the Americas, including Mexico and the Caribbean, it’s a spice that goes by many names – achiote, annato, roucou, achuete – and takes many forms; sold as seeds, paste, powder, bricks or steeped in oil. But you will know it by its signature orange-red hue, and the way it turns everything it touches to gold. Commonly used as a yellow food colouring, achiote has an earthy, peppery flavour that works beautifully in rice and fish dishes, or in cochinita pibil, the Yucatán peninsula’s signature smoky, slow-cooked pork. Achiote paste is easy enough to find online or at specialty grocers, ready to be mixed into vibrant marinades (and scrubbed off your hands later). 100% blue weber agave tequilaForget everything you thought you knew about tequila. Just like champagne, authentic tequila is all about provenance. Strictly governed by the Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT), it can only be produced in five states, with 99% hailing from the mountainous Jalisco region in north-west Mexico – home to the town of Tequila, and the birthplace of mariachi music – where lush fields of blue weber agave mirror the sky, hand-harvested by skilled jimadores using methods passed down through generations. The result is a spirit that really sings. Made from 100% blue weber agave and double distilled for sparkling clarity, el Jimador Blanco is the perfect re-education; a tequila that demands to be sipped and savoured with food and friends. Crisp, vibrant and aromatic, with a perfect balance of bright citrus notes and herbaceous warmth, try it neat over ice, or blend with freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice, agave syrup, a squeeze of lime and soda water for the authentic Paloma, Mexico’s signature cocktail – and maybe your new signature too. For a truly authentic experience, pair your Paloma with a zesty shrimp or scallop ceviche or, if you’re feeling slightly less adventurous, a chile-laced guacamole and salty tortilla chips. CactusThe iconic desert plant may have enjoyed a long stint as a homewares trend in the UK, but somehow dining on cactus hasn’t caught on in the same way. Which is a shame, because beneath their spines, these succulents are exactly that – tender and meaty, with a delicate, verdant flavour somewhere left of green beans and asparagus. The most commonly edible cactus is the prickly pear – or nopales, as it’s known in Mexico, where it’s a common feature on menus and market stalls. Once safely peeled, the flesh of the large, flat pads can be eaten raw in salads or boiled and sauteéd. Mexican food blogger Mely Martinez recommends adding it to scrambled eggs, salads, or grilling the pads whole and topping them with melted cheese. The moral of this story? Even the prickliest characters can be worth getting to know. Ancho chilliThough it’s a misconception that “real” Mexican food is always hotter than the sun, the humble chilli pepper does have a starring role, with a rainbow of popular varieties ranging from the mild and fruity guajillo to the head-blowing habanero. If you’re still reaching for the same jar of generic powder every time a recipe calls for chilli, it’s time to level up. Ancho chillies are a great place to start. The dried version of the plump poblano chilli, these wrinkly peppers might not win any beauty pageants, but their versatility makes them a great addition to your store cupboard. With a sweet, smoky flavour reminiscent of chocolate and raisins, ancho chillies bring depth and warmth to slow-cooked meat and sauces; they are a key ingredient in adobo rojo de chiles, the go-to marinade that forms the base of so many quintessential Mexican dishes. And if you’re a spice wimp, worry not – they’re relatively tame, measuring between 1,000 and 2,000 units on the Scoville scale (for comparison, the habanero starts at an eye-popping 100,000). TamalesWhen it comes to portable meals, Mexico has things all wrapped up. But while the UK is well versed in burritos, fajitas and enchiladas, it’s time for the lesser-spotted tamale to take its place at the table. Tamales feature a soft dough made from lard, spices and cornmeal (typically masa harina, the same flour used to make tortillas), stuffed with an endless variety of meaty, veggie, cheese or bean-based fillings and steamed within a wrapper made from corn husk or banana leaf. No quick-fix supper, making tamales takes time – but hosting a tamalada, or tamale-making party, is a perfect way to divide the work and share the fruits of your labour. Pass the parcel. Mexican chocolateChocolate? Sure, you’ve heard of it. But real Mexican chocolate is a world away from the smooth, sweet bars Europeans are used to. Notable for its distinctive, bitter flavour profile and rustic, grainy texture, Mexico’s traditional chocolate is made from cacao nibs, which are roasted and coarsely ground before being combined with sugar, cinnamon and sometimes other additions such as vanilla, nuts or cayenne pepper. Though it’s satisfying to nibble on, the chocolate really comes into its own as a cookery ingredient, used in intensely chocolatey cakes and desserts and to lend depth and complexity to savoury dishes such as stews, chillies and the quintessential mole poblano sauce. But perhaps the most popular use of all is melted into hot chocolate, which is traditionally whipped into an aerated froth with a wooden molinillo whisk.

4/22/2022,"Often associated with partying, Cinco de Mayo tends to be somewhat misunderstood outside of Mexico. Translated as “Fifth of May”, the fiesta has become very popular in the US (and increasingly the UK), where it is frequently – and erroneously – thought to mark Mexican Independence Day. Here’s the lowdown on what Cinco de Mayo actually commemorates, and tips on how you can mark the occasion in a culturally sensitive way … So, what exactly is Cinco de Mayo?Cinco de Mayo commemorates a battle that took place on 5 May 1862, when a small group of Mexican fighters, whose resources and morale were severely depleted after the end of the Mexican civil war, defeated French troops under the command of Napoleon III. It was an improbable victory that stunned the world. The battle came about as years of fighting had left Mexico almost penniless. Because of this, the president, Benito Juarez, decided to suspend all foreign debt payments for two years to rebuild the country’s fortunes. France objected to this plan and sent in her troops – as did England and Spain, although the latter two nations eventually withdrew. Sadly, Mexico’s Cinco de Mayo victory was short-lived as French troops returned, won, and advanced to Mexico City just a year later. But their initial victory lives on as a cause for pride and celebration. How is Cinco de Mayo celebrated in Mexico?Despite its international fame, Cinco de Mayo is only an official holiday in the state of Puebla, where the battle took place, where it’s known as El Día de la Batalla de Puebla (Day of the Battle of Puebla). Festivities have a decidedly militaristic feel and often stretch over several weeks to coincide with the region’s mole festival. The mood is both solemnly commemorative and celebratory, with parades featuring charros and escaramuzas – Mexican cowboys and cowgirls – re-enactments of the battle, feasting, and much drinking of tequila. Why did Cinco de Mayo become so popular in the US?With the festival’s major themes being cultural pride and the struggle for democracy and independence, Cinco de Mayo still holds great significance for Mexican-Americans today – and in recent years has felt more relevant than ever. Sadly, the real story of the fiesta has somewhat been lost in translation, with many non-Mexican Americans seeing it simply as an excuse for a good time – earning the festival the nickname “Cinco de Drinko”. So … is it appropriate for non-Mexicans to mark the occasion?As long as you are respectful and aware of what you’re actually celebrating, the feeling among my Mexican friends is, yes, join in the festivities. Handily, the date of the fiesta roughly coincides with the UK’s early May bank holiday, making it the perfect opportunity for Britons and British-based Mexicans to celebrate with family and friends over the three-day weekend. I’m sure we can all agree, there has never been a better time to gather together to celebrate and cherish the values of Cinco de Mayo. Ok, great stuff. So is there something special we should drink?As bright in the glass as the petals of the dahlia, Mexico’s national flower, the Paloma should be your cocktail or choice – not least because its name translates as “the dove”, a symbol of peace. Although nobody knows exactly how the drink got its name, the cocktail bible Difford’s Guide says the Paloma – which combines tequila with pink grapefruit juice, agave syrup, lime juice and soda water – may have been created by Don Javier Delgado Corona, a famous bar owner from Tequila, Mexico. Authentic tequila – such as el Jimador’s 100% blue weber agave tequila – is a spirit that deserves to be enjoyed for the silky softness that is the mark of a master distiller, and the Paloma is perfect for that. And what should we eat?Puebla is a vibrant food destination, so why not choose some of its best-known dishes to share with friends and family? Manchamanteles, which translates as “tablecloth stainer”, could not be more party-appropriate. Packed with pork or turkey and smothered in mole flavoured with pineapples, apples, pears, almonds, tomatoes and onions, it is claimed as one of the state of Oaxaca’s “siete moles” (seven moles). Chiles en nogada – fried peppers with walnut sauce, pomegranate seeds, and parsley – brings the red, green and white of the Mexican flag to life on your plate. While mole poblano might well be Puebla’s most famous dish; its rich, velvety-dark base of chocolate, seeds, chillies, nuts, and fruit reflecting the melding of Indigenous and European food cultures for which Mexico is famous.

4/22/2022,"Prosecutors in Portugal have officially named a German national Christian Brueckner as an arguido or suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Usually translated as “named suspect,” “formal suspect” or “person of interest,” the status of arguido – or in the case of a woman, arguida – is used in Portugal’s legal system and in other jurisdictions based on the Portuguese system. Authorities use it to categorise someone who is treated by Portuguese police as more than a witness, but has not been arrested or charged. Robert Murat, an Anglo-Portuguese property developer who lived 100 yards from where Madeleine disappeared and who helped in the initial search, was made an arguido after detectives took him in for questioning. Murat was formally cleared of suspicion in 2008 and won damages for defamatory reports of his involvement in the disappearance. Kate McCann, Madeleine’s mother, was formally declared an arguida on 7 September 2007, after 10 hours of questioning by Portuguese police. Gerry McCann was given arguido status on the following day after further police questioning. It wasn’t until July 2008, after Portuguese police had submitted their final report, that both parents were formally cleared by the Portuguese authorities of involvement in their daughter’s disappearance. “It is hard to describe how utterly despairing it was to be named arguidos and subsequently portrayed in the media as suspects in our own daughter’s abduction,” said Kate McCann, who added it had been “equally devastating to witness the detrimental effect” it had on the search for her daughter. Christian Brueckner, a convicted rapist identified as a murder suspect by German prosecutors in June 2020, has been formally identified as a suspect by Portuguese authorities. The timing of the move could be related to Portugal’s 15-year statute of limitations for crimes with a maximum prison sentence of 10 years or more. Madeleine disappeared on 3 May 2007, while on holiday with her parents in Praia da Luz in Portugal. Someone with the status has legal protection that is not extended to a witness, including the right to remain silent during questioning and the right to legal representation. Detectives invoke arguido status on someone as a preliminary to an arrest being made or charges brought, according to experts in Portuguese law. Investigators might treat someone as an arguido as soon as they have sufficient evidence but in some circumstances they have been known to hold back to give a suspect a false sense of security. In practical terms, a person has to be declared an arguido before he or she can be arrested and the approach of investigators to interviews typically shifts if someone’s status changes from being a witness. Once a case file is completed, the police pass it to the public ministry, the equivalent of the crown prosecution service, which decides whether an acusacao or indictment is brought.",News/UK news,Madeleine McCann case: what does Christian Brueckner arguido status mean?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/madeleine-mccann-case-what-does-christian-brueckner-arguido-status-mean
4/22/2022,"Recurring throughout Lennart Hüper’s sombre documentary are images of the vast, deep ocean, whose rippling surface hums with an ominous melancholy. Against a gloomy soundscape of crashing waves and beeping boat signals, staggering facts flash up on the screen, stating the numbers of Libyan refugees who have died or gone missing at sea as they attempt to escape from their war-torn country and detention camps to Europe. Meanwhile, Lifeline, a civilian ship that carries out rescue missions for refugees, has been impounded on the coast of Malta for months, as its captain Claus-Peter Reisch endures fines and charges of commanding an improperly registered ship. Exposing how the arduous legal ordeal is a red herring in a political unwillingness to aid refugees, the film documents the inspiring resilience with which Reisch and his crew maintain the day-to-day operation of Lifeline while seeking legislative changes to allow government-sanctioned aid for refugees stranded at sea. At one point, Lifeline supporters hand out leaflets during the festive season to holiday shoppers; the matter-of-fact scenes of seasonal jollity feel especially heartbreaking when, right on their doorsteps, the same simple luxury is denied to displaced Libyan refugees. Much of No News revolves around the unsettling monotony of waiting. As the Lifeline crew patiently prepare their meals every day, the waste of resources underlines the cruelty of bureaucracy. The Libyan refugees are also waiting for something that might never come, a longing hemmed in by death, violence and uncertainty.

4/22/2022,"In late 2020, during lockdown, I met a nice guy. We started dating and our relationship developed at a rapid pace. Six months into our relationship, I found an email on his computer from his university sweetheart. When we first met, he had told me about her, and how, 20 years before, he was in love with her and wanted to marry her, but his family disapproved. She later got married to someone else, and he moved on with his life. The email was a short correspondence about general things, nothing “out of line”. Still, I was upset he was still in touch with her. A month later I confronted him and he explained that she had contacted him before we met to tell him that she forgave him. He told me that getting back in touch with her was a relief to him, as the heartbreak he experienced never left him – and even acted as a barrier in future relationships. Soon after, we moved in together and got married. Then, one day, I was able to access his phone and saw messages between them. They had been talking to each other for months over Facebook. Two hours of video calls – we never talked for more than 20 minutes over the phone! The last phone call was two weeks before he asked me to move in with him. I try to tell myself that this was a turning point for him – that it was only after talking to her that he realised things were serious between us. I would like to believe that he told her about me moving in, which is why they stopped talking suddenly. But I am deeply hurt. I know he loves me, and I love him. I just don’t get why he did that. What if she gets in touch with him again? What would happen? If she got back in touch, why should the message from your husband be any different from what it has been since he’s met you? What do you think might change? I don’t know if you are obsessed with the past (or more accurately, his past) because you do sense something is going on – or because you are self-sabotaging, for whatever reason. Some people do stay in touch with exes, and some don’t. What about your exes? I know when I had my first serious relationship I couldn’t believe my then partner was in touch with his ex, but as I grew up and accrued my own “past”, I realised that, sometimes, things aren’t straightforward. Clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst Stephen Blumenthal had some interesting perspectives. First, he felt that the fact you met in lockdown is not to be underestimated: “It wasn’t at a normal social pace, where you see each other in between going back to your normal life; you were forced together. In these situations, the relationship can develop very rapidly and be idealised, then there’s a crash when reality intrudes.” You mention yourself, in your longer letter, that this was at a rapid pace for you; I wonder if it was too quick. You mention you didn’t know about the Facebook conversations until after you were married – would they have changed your mind? Blumenthal wanted to stress that “you have every right to confront this and you shouldn’t feel you had to wait a month to do so”. It’s important to know yourself, and ask for what you need, thereby giving your partner the chance to provide that – or not. There’s no point reasoning away your doubts and fears and pretending they don’t exist. Doing so negates those needs and provides fertile soil for resentment and separation to flourish. You mention, in your longer letter, about needing to feel safe. “We all have a need for ‘psychological safety’,” says Blumenthal. “You’ll need to fully explore how you feel with your husband, and he’ll need to understand those feelings.” Telling your husband how his being in touch with his ex made you feel is a clear communication of your needs. That’s scary, because it makes you vulnerable, and he may not meet them, but it’s also ultimately empowering. However, you will have to admit you went in to his phone.

4/22/2022,"Paloma Elsesser is my favourite supermodel. Is it weird that I still have a favourite supermodel at 48? Maybe, I guess, but none of us gets to choose the pop culture we grow up with. I was 13 when Cindy Crawford first made the cover of British Vogue, and I had that picture taped to my bedroom wall, an altar to all-American sex appeal that would have been Elvis had it been 1956 not 1986. By the 1990s, supermodels were everywhere, like footballers on the then-ubiquitous Panini stickers, and I pored over their glamorous names and brief, glorious careers. I loved Christy Turlington, so serene and graceful. There was Kate Moss, obviously, and, much later, that day in London when Stella Tennant came out of retirement to open a Victoria Beckham show.Elsesser is different, because she is plus-sized. She is the first non-skinny supermodel to steal my heart. She is not the first beautiful bigger supermodel – Ashley Graham scored her first Vogue cover in 2017 – but she is the first plus-sized cover girl who has fully embodied the rock-star persona of a supermodel. When Elsesser is on a catwalk, nobody in the room can look at anyone else, and she knows it. She’s not just my favourite model; she’s everyone’s. The fashion world is obsessed with her, too. After years of grudgingly paying lip service to the existence of bodies that are bigger and softer by including one or two plus-sizes in their casting – often in loose, vaguely shaped clothes, or photographed only from the shoulders up – Elsesser’s fame feels different.I get it. I realise that taking such an absurdly long time to fall for a model who isn’t skinny flags me as a blinkered muppet. Still, I think it is probably better to be honest about this, however unflattering a light it paints me in. The revelation isn’t that Elsesser is beautiful (doh!) but that blinkered muppetry lingered so long in a dark place in my heart and, now, finally, is evaporating. It’s not that I’ve been unable to recognise that beauty comes in different shapes and sizes. I could stand in front of one of Titian’s 16th-century beauties, pillowy of cheek and thigh, and feel my pupils dilate, but until recently my internal template for supermodel gorgeousness was narrower than I admitted. About five years ago, when plus-sized bodies on catwalks were like hen’s teeth, I was at a London fashion week show where, in a parade of minuscule bodies, one size-16 model took her turn. The audience applauded politely and I remember feeling mortified on her behalf because, however well meant, it felt patronising. A Cindy, Kate or Naomi doesn’t get respectful clapping; she makes everyone hold their breath and stare. And now, here we are. Because that’s what happens with Paloma. Why has fashion been so uptight about body shape for so long? Perhaps because it is as much about status as it is about aesthetics. Supermodels – and who gets to be one – are significant, because they are where fashion infiltrates our real lives. Their faces are on magazines, their names are in newspapers along with details of their bank balances, relationships, houses. Status stuff. Slowly, slower than we like to admit, these sands are shifting. Like I said, it’s not that Elsesser now gets to be beautiful. She doesn’t need my blessing for that. What has changed is that I get to stop being a muppet. I’m taking that as a blessing from her.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Yes I’m late to the party, but supermodel Paloma Elsesser is my new catwalk crush | Jess Cartner-Morley",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/22/supermodel-paloma-elsesser-is-my-new-catwalk-crush
4/22/2022,"Isometimes wonder what my parents would have made of today’s diet, which they would have found mysteriously devoid of meat and two veg. Of course, there are still people (some of my best friends and family members among them) for whom a meal isn’t proper unless it includes some kind of animal-based protein, but, while I am an omnivore, I often go days without eating meat at all. In the wine trade, however, there’s still a tendency for the back labels to suggest meat and fish pairings, or to restrict vegetarian recommendations to veggie lasagnes or stews. The world of vegetarian and vegan cooking is as broad, if not broader, than meat, fish and dairy-based food, but many wine producers still seem to be mentally stuck in the nut-roast rut. As I’ve said before, when it comes to choosing a wine to go with a meal, it’s much more useful to think of the way a dish is cooked and the overall intensity of its flavours than simply focus on the main ingredient. If you’re serving your vegetables lightly cooked or raw and crunchy, you want the sort of wine you would drink with seafood: a crisp, dry white or rosé, for preference. Deep-fry them, however, as in tempura or any kind of fritter, and you’d be better off reaching for a bottle of cava or crémant, or even champagne. When vegetables are seared, roasted or, above all, barbecued, meanwhile, they can take the kind of hearty red you’d serve with a meat dish, especially if pulses such as lentils are involved. There’s also the seasonal element that applies just as much to vegetable dishes as to meaty and fishy ones: light, springtime food, for instance, calls for light, summery wines – both red as well as white. Articles on pairing vegetarian food and wine also tend to overlook that most desserts are vegetarian, if not vegan, which means you can have a field day with sweet wines such as the sublime, orange-blossom-scented Domaine Pieretti muscat from Corsica that features in today’s pick. Frustratingly, many labels still don’t specify whether a wine is suitable for vegetarians; in other words, that it is not made with any animal-based products (some use milk-based proteins, isinglass or egg whites for fining, for example). Supermarkets have increasingly moved to making their own-label wines suitable for vegans, and clearly indicate that fact on the labels, but I had to check in the case of that muscat. I reckon that sort of information should be standard these days. Mimo Moutinho Arinto Vinho Verde 2021 £5.49 Aldi, 11.5%. Brilliantly priced, crisp Portuguese white to drink with raw veg and dips. Villa Maria Earth Garden Sauvignon Blanc 2020 £10.50 Tesco, 14%. Really vibrant savvy blanc in the classic Marlborough style. One for goat’s cheese salads or asparagus. Viña Zorzal Garnacha 2020 £7.25 The Wine Society, 13.5%. Bright, juicy, gulpable red that would be perfect with grilled and roast veg. Spain’s answer to beaujolais.

4/22/2022,"Imagine you fell into a coma some time around the start of the millennium and just woke up. What year is it? You scan the cinema releases for clues. Let’s see: Keanu Reeves just had a new Matrix movie out, Tom Cruise has a Top Gun sequel coming out, Patrick Stewart is on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, Jamie Lee Curtis is working on yet another Halloween sequel, and Michael Keaton is returning as Batman. Surely you’ve only been out a few months? Except, wait a minute: all these actors appear to have aged several decades. Except Tom Cruise, which is even more confusing. Welcome to the new reality of franchise movies, which is suspiciously like the old reality. Everywhere you look, veteran actors are being dragged out of retirement and back to roles they thought they’d moved on from years, even decades, ago. It’s like the opposite of cancel culture. It used to be that A-list actors would occasionally dip their toes in a blockbuster world when they had a new house or a divorce to finance, say, but increasingly they are finding that, as the Eagles would put it, you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave. Franchise movies have come to dominate the box office in the past decade, at the expense of most other kinds of film. But post-pandemic, it’s by no means certain that dominance will continue. Instead of moving forwards, mainstream entertainment seems to be going backwards; back over old ground, back to old characters and back, perhaps, to a time when blockbusters were a surer thing than they currently are. The coming year promises to be one big deja vu. We already had a taste of it with recent superhero spin-off Morbius. Casual viewers may have been surprised, or simply confused, by the movie’s post-credits scenes, which suddenly introduced Michael Keaton – who’d had nothing to do with the preceding quasi-vampire antics. This was teeing up the return of Keaton as the Vulture, the villain he last portrayed five years ago in Spider-Man: Homecoming – the first of Tom Holland’s Spider-Man movies. Keaton’s next superhero callback is even more jarring. In DC’s forthcoming The Flash, as has been widely reported, Keaton returns as Batman for the first time since, er, Batman Returns, 30 years ago. Ben Affleck’s recently retired Batman also reportedly returns in The Flash, even as Robert Pattinson unveiled his new Batman incarnation this February. Moviegoers might be experiencing a sense of double deja vu here. It was only last year that Marvel pulled the exact same trick. In Spider-Man: No Way Home, Tom Holland was joined by preceding Spider-Men Tobey Maguire (who last appeared in the role in 2007) and Andrew Garfield (last seen in 2014), plus vintage villains played by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx. Both Marvel and DC are playing with “multiverse” storylines, which provide a convenient excuse to bring back popular actors with whom older viewers might be more familiar. It’s not just superhero movies, though. In May, Tom Cruise is back in the cockpit for Top Gun: Maverick after a hiatus of 36 years. In June comes Jurassic World: Dominion, which includes a few thespian dinosaurs alongside the CGI ones, namely Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum – reunited for the first time since the original Jurassic Park in 1993. Jamie Lee Curtis is currently working on a new Halloween sequel, having returned to the franchise in 2018 after a 16-year absence. And as well as his small-screen return as Star Trek’s Jean-Luc Picard (also after a 20-year break), Patrick Stewart is to resurrect his X-Men character Charles Xavier in the next Doctor Strange movie – again, 22 years after he first played him, and five years after he supposedly died in 2017’s Logan. Actors reprising their old roles is not a new phenomenon in an era where every expensively acquired IP must be optimally monetised through reboots, sequels and spin-offs. But something seems to have changed. Look at Harrison Ford. In 2008, he returned as Indiana Jones after two decades, ostensibly to pass the whip to the next generation in the form of Shia LaBeouf, who played his son. Ford then returned as Star Wars’ Han Solo in 2015, alongside Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, again forming a bridge between the original movie trilogy and the latest one. Then in 2017, Ford was back after 35 years as Rick Deckard in Blade Runner 2049, again lending a sense of continuity to the long-delayed sequel. None of these roles have done Ford any harm, but in torch-passing terms they haven’t worked out so well. The Indiana Jones franchise looks to have backed the wrong horse in LaBeouf, whose career has since veered away from A-list roles and been rocked by allegations of sexual assault (which LaBeouf denies). As a result, Ford, who turns 80 this summer, is back shooting a fifth instalment of Indiana Jones, due out next year. With Star Wars, too, there seems to be little appetite for further adventures with the new generation. Instead, the franchise is winding back the clock: next month comes an Obi-Wan Kenobi miniseries, with Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen stepping back into Jedi robes after a break of nearly 20 years. It seems as if Hollywood’s franchise movies are eager to move their stories on and put the pandemic behind them, but cinema audiences just aren’t coming with them. It is telling that the only genuine post-pandemic blockbuster has been the three-for-the-price-of-one Spider-Man: No Way Home. That took $1.9bn globally, making it the sixth highest-grossing movie in history. Marvel’s other post-pandemic offerings, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Eternals, both of which introduced brand new characters, each took less than $500m worldwide – underwhelming by Marvel’s high standards. Could the problem be young people? Traditionally, the 18-25 demographic has been the lifeblood of cinemagoing, but even before the pandemic there were signs young audiences were in decline. According to industry researcher Stephen Follows, UK cinema admissions for 15- to 24-year-olds fell 20% between 2011 and 2017, while the proportion of older cinemagoers grew. It is a similar story in the US and elsewhere. In his research, Follows often meets teenagers who have never been inside a cinema before. “Going to the cinema has got more expensive, which much more negatively affects younger audiences, because they have less disposable income,” he says. In addition, the pandemic did much to accelerate the rise of streaming. For the first time, major studios released their tentpole movies online either simultaneously with or instead of a cinema release. The theatrical window has been broken, and is unlikely to ever be fixed. In the digital era, no one has to go to the cinema any more, not least young people. In this light, the reinstatement of older actors to draw back older viewers – the ones who still remember the magic of moviegoing – makes sense. It is still too early to predict the shape of cinemagoing post-pandemic, but it may never return to the heights of 2019, says Comscore’s senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “If we wind up at 70 or 80% of pre-pandemic levels in North America [for 2022], I think that’s a great place, but we really need more than that to get the industry much more robust,” he says. The future of cinemagoing is not just down to demographics, Dergarabedian adds: “Appealing to nostalgia with casting is great as long as the movie’s good.” Spider-Man: No Way Home was successful not just because of the casting but because it was a genuine crowd-pleaser. “If, let’s not call it stunt casting, let’s say if inspired casting is the catalyst to get people to go back to the movie theatre to see a really good movie, so be it. That’s great.” In that respect, dragging the old guard out of retirement to sustain flagging interest could be a short-term fix at best. If audiences see it as a desperate gimmick to boost a cash-hungry Hollywood that’s running out of ideas, that would only accelerate the decline. But are we talking about the decline of cinema, or simply the decline of blockbuster cinema? Franchise cinema now dominates the movie market at the expense of all others. In 2019, franchise movies took 83% of worldwide box office for Hollywood movies.

4/22/2022,"Madonna has listed her California mansion for $26m, a little more than a year after buying it from the R&B singer the Weeknd. The 63-year-old singer-songwriter paid $19.3m for the property, located 20 miles from Los Angeles in the star-studded Hidden Hills neighbourhood, in April 2021. The 12,500 sq ft home has nine bedrooms, a two-storey wall of windows, an infinity saltwater pool and spa and a bright orange basketball court. The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, was the home’s first owner and paid $18.2m for the property in 2017. The Blinding Lights singer originally listed the mansion, which has a climate-controlled glass wine cellar, a theatre room and a five-car garage, for $25m in 2020. But after 10 months on the market, Madonna snapped it up for almost $6m less. The Weeknd has since moved to a $70m property in Bel Air. The property is located in 1.2 hectares (3 acres) of land accessible via a guarded gate and includes a barn, a gym and a dance studio. Madonna has listed the house with the Beverly Hills Estates, which represented the singer when she bought the property last April. The agency describes the main house as sitting at the end of an olive tree-lined driveway with a “storybook bridge”, a great room with an indoor-outdoor bar and adjoining outdoor living room, and a formal dining room with a fireplace. The gated Hidden Hills community is a favourite neighbourhood for some of Hollywood’s biggest names, including the Kardashians. The Canadian hip-hop star Drake recently sold a pair of houses in the area to Matthew Stafford, the quarterback of the LA Rams NFL football team, for $11m. Last year, Madonna announced a lucrative career-spanning deal with her original record label, Warner Music, in which her four-decade catalogue of hits from Papa Don’t Preach to Like a Virgin will be rereleased over the coming years.",Arts/Music,Madonna lists California home for $26m year after buying from the Weeknd,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/madonna-lists-california-home-for-26m-year-after-buying-from-the-weeknd
4/22/2022,"A new audio clip reveals that House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy considered asking Donald Trump to resign as president in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 Capitol insurrection. The explosive clip was released by the New York Times and played on MSNBC Thursday night, just half a day after McCarthy released a lengthy denial of an earlier Times report that said he and the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, initially both held Trump responsible for the attack, and both privately expressed anger against him. In the clip, which is a soundbite from a call with House GOP leaders, McCarthy can be heard answering a question from Republican representative Liz Cheney, who was in party leadership at the time. Cheney asked McCarthy if he believed Trump would resign if Congress successfully passed a 25th amendment resolution, which would declare Trump incapable of holding office. “My gut tells me no. I am seriously thinking about having that conversation with him tonight,” he said. “The only discussion I would have with him is I think [the resolution] will pass, and it would be my recommendation that he should resign. “That would be my take, but I don’t think he would take it. But I don’t know.” In a statement on Thursday morning before the clip was released, McCarthy made a blanket denial of the New York Times report saying that it is “totally false and wrong”. “It comes as no surprise that the corporate media is obsessed with doing everything it can to further the liberal agenda,” the statement read. “The corporate media is more concerned with profiting from manufactured political intrigue from politically-motivated sources. “Our country has suffered enough under failed one-party Democrat rule, and no amount of media ignorance and bias will stop Americans from delivering a clear message this fall that it is time for change.” McCarthy has not responded to the release of the audio clip. A spokesperson for Cheney, who is also heard on the clip, said she did not release the tape and does not know who leaked it. The Times story, the reporting for which comes from the upcoming book This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future, by reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, detailed scathing comments against Trump that Republican leaders made in the days after the Capitol insurrection. McCarthy reportedly told colleagues in private: “I’ve had it with this guy,” adding: “What he did is unacceptable. Nobody can defend it and nobody should defend it.” Meanwhile, McConnell reportedly told two of his senior advisers: “If this isn’t impeachable, I don’t know what is. “The Democrats are going to take care of the son of a bitch for us,” McConnell said, according to the book. Although McConnell criticized Trump publicly for his role in the attack, he voted to acquit the former president in his impeachment trial. He also said he would support Trump should Trump be the 2024 Republican nominee. McCarthy, for his part, did a more complete about-face: he has claimed that Trump was unaware of the attack until McCarthy broke the news to him that it was happening. He has also condemned the special House panel that is investigating the insurrection and refused to cooperate with its inquiry on conversations he had with Trump after the attack.",News/US news,"Republican leader Kevin McCarthy considered urging Trump to quit, audio reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/kevin-mccarthy-trump-recording-house-republican-capitol-attack
4/22/2022,"Mark Williams surged into the quarter-finals of the World Snooker Championship with a session to spare, wrapping up a dominant 13-3 win over his fellow Welshman and protege, Jackson Page. The three-time Crucible champion looked close to his best form as he compiled six centuries and eight further breaks of 50-plus. Resuming on Friday with a 7-1 advantage, Williams showed no mercy to his opponent, a close friend off the table who trains at his club in Tredegar. Opening with a break of 110 to move further in front, Williams then snatched the 10th frame with a clearance to the black after Page missed the last red, leaving him stranded on 69, the 20-year-old qualifier’s highest break of the match. Two half-centuries in the next frame made it 10-1 for Williams, who was fulfilling his tongue-in-cheek claim that he wanted to “destroy” Page, who set up the meeting with an impressive first-round success over Barry Hawkins. Page finally got a second frame on the board but Williams was ruthless, firing back-to-back centuries and then, after Page clawed back another frame, finishing the contest with a 56 break. Williams will face either the defending champion, Mark Selby, or Yan Bingtao in the quarter-finals; their second-round match begins on Friday afternoon. Ronnie O’Sullivan is on course for a place in the last eight after establishing a 6-2 lead over Northern Ireland’s Mark Allen in the first session of their second-round clash. O’Sullivan, who is seeking to equal Stephen Hendry’s record of seven Crucible titles, began by potting 10 reds and nine blacks at the start of the first frame. Despite running out of position for an attempted maximum, O’Sullivan did not let up. Allen had briefly levelled at 1-1, but breaks of 131, 69 and 96 sent the No 2 seed 4-1 in front. The six-time world champion increased his lead in the sixth frame and then stole the seventh with a break of 57 after a shellshocked Allen missed a green off its spot with the frame at his mercy. The Northern Irishman rallied to take the final frame of the session but faces an uphill struggle when the game continues on Friday evening. Jack Lisowski has criticised the World Snooker Tour for refusing to let him wear a Ukraine flag on his waistcoat at this year’s tournament in Sheffield. The No 14 seed, who represents England and was born in Cheltenham, has a Ukrainian grandfather. “Everyone in this room would agree [to] supporting Ukraine so why the hell can’t I wear it?” Lisowski told the BBC. “It’s something that is close to my heart. My grandad is Ukrainian, my dad has been out there. It is very sad what is going on over there.” Lisowski, who will play Neil Robertson in the second round, added: “I tried to wear it [in Sheffield] and they told me I couldn’t unless I was Ukrainian. I’ve got some Ukrainian in me, but it wasn’t enough … I want to wear it but I wasn’t allowed.” The World Snooker Tour (WST) said in a statement: “Our policy is to not allow our sport to be used as a political platform at the world championship. We are strongly against the invasion of any sovereign nation and all forms of violence or oppression. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the people who are suffering as a result of the current conflict in Ukraine.”",Sport/Sport,"Mark Williams races into Crucible last eight, O’Sullivan in charge against Allen",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/world-snooker-mark-williams-ronnie-o-sullivan-crucible
4/22/2022,"The contrast was marked. Shortly after the Commons agreed a third Partygate inquiry, the few visible Conservative MPs seemed notably downcast while colleagues had already scarpered, wheeling their suitcases out of Westminster and heading to their constituencies amid the chaos of government U-turns. The mood in the Labour team, meanwhile, was ebullient after the party led the humiliation. Keir Starmer joined aides for a drinks gathering on the Commons terrace that evening. “It’s not the first time we’ve done this kind of thing, and everyone has done an amazing job,” one official said. “But it’s also fair to say that if there was a way for the government to have messed up this week, they’ve managed to find it.” Boris Johnson has perhaps experienced worse weeks as prime minister, but none have so brutally underlined the contrast between his ebbing authority and the increasingly focused tactics of Starmer’s operation, plus the willingness of opposition parties to cooperate. A painstakingly drafted motion paving the way for a Partygate inquiry by the Commons privileges committee eventually passed without a vote. It was written by Labour but signed by the Westminster leaders or sole MPs from six other parties, including the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats. Labour officials sought wording that would prevent ministers from trying to delay or dismiss the process, specifying that the inquiry would not fully begin until the end of the police investigation. To get around another government objection, the committee’s Labour chair, Chris Bryant, who has criticised the prime minister, said he would step back from the process. Bryant even discussed this with Graham Brady, the shop steward for Tory backbenchers, to make sure the message got through. All this took place in a truncated Tuesday to Thursday political week after the bank holiday, with opposition parties first sounding out the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, over timetabling a motion before MPs had returned from their Easter recess. Another challenge for Labour was to avoid potentially alienating voters when Starmer challenged the prime minister in the Commons on the same subject on three consecutive days, requiring a varied approach. On Tuesday, responding to Johnson’s Commons apology for receiving a fixed-penalty notice, Starmer took a personal tone, calling the PM “a man without shame”. The next day at prime minister’s questions, Starmer tried to pin down Johnson over details. Finally, opening the debate on Thursday, he sought to highlight the constitutional principles involved. The overall plan was to leave Downing Street with two unavoidable and unpalatable choices: accepting the motion, or whipping Conservative MPs to vote it down, leaving them open to accusations of trying to block scrutiny. Such was the tangle that while Downing Street did table an amendment, late on Wednesday evening, little more than 12 hours later it had been dropped after Tory MPs made it plain they could not support the tactic. The end result is Johnson will be investigated for alleged lying, many Tory MPs are even more unhappy, and a news agenda No 10 had hoped would be shaped by the prime minister’s visit to India has been dominated by questions about his honesty. “I think we can say it went well,” one official for another opposition party said. “All these Commons procedures can seem deeply weird. But people know a shambles when they see one. It’s like the chaos over Theresa May’s Brexit deal. No one really understood the deal, but they all knew it was a shambles.” Credit for Labour’s strategy will inevitably fall on its chief whip, Alan Campbell, and Starmer’s political director, Luke Sullivan. But Labour aides stressed the wider team element. Meanwhile, though MPs from either side will be wary about reading too much into a handful of days, Tory backbenchers are gloomily aware that the much-vaunted rejig of No 10 staff and the whipping operation has not brought about the changes billed. There were many factors behind the decision to drop the government amendment minutes before the debate began, but it was not a good sign for the new chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, in terms of gauging the mood of his MPs. Hannah White, the deputy director of the Institute for Government thinktank, said it was a surprise that the government had got itself into such a mess. “If they’d looked at it calmly, they could have just said, ‘We can let this pass. We have nothing to hide,’” she said. “But it has ended up being an own goal. They didn’t need to expend all this political capital, and they’ve ended up looking defensive.” While the procedure could appear arcane, White said, the issues at stake were vital: “Fundamentally, this isn’t about parties. It isn’t even about Boris Johnson’s career. It’s about whether we care that when a prime minister comes to the Commons, they make sure that what they are saying is true. “If that’s not the case then the whole point of parliament in terms of its scrutiny role is undermined. Parliament has to be able to trust that when ministers come before it, they are telling the truth. Ministers need the discipline of believing that it is important they tell parliament the truth.”",News/Politics,Labour toasts its success in Boris Johnson’s Partygate humiliation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/boris-johnson-partygate-labour-keir-starmer
4/22/2022,"In his late 70s, Albert Costa spent 10 days in a coma after a massive heart attack. When he woke up, one thing was clear: he would sell his life’s collection of books. There was a catch, however. Costa’s bookshop would not sell its products at their market value, but at a price he personally felt they were truly worth. Now 83, Costa trained first as an engineer and then as an anthropologist. He spent much of his life travelling around Africa and the Pacific acquiring artefacts for museums. He also became a compulsive book collector. What he did not want was for them to end up in a flea market where “no one knows the value of what is in them and they sell them all for one euro”. The solution was to open Espíritus del Agua (water spirits) in Gràcia, Barcelona, and stock it with his private collection of works on anthropology, art, philosophy and travel, as well as fiction. The tiny shop, crammed from floor to ceiling with books, takes its name from an exhibition about Inuit art that Costa helped organise in 2000 for Fundació La Caixa, the cultural organisation linked to one of Spain’s largest banks. “I sell books but it’s a business that barely pays the overheads,” he says. “I enjoy it because it’s a new career. But rather than sell them all to a library, I like people to come and look and then we can come to an agreement.” At one point a customer enters the shop and browses for about 10 minutes, then leaves. “Has she gone?” asks Costa, who is profoundly deaf. “Oh well, she’s looked at the books. Books are for looking at too.” Pricing, he says, is a delicate issue. “Lots of people have this idea that secondhand books have no value but I believe a secondhand book should be only a little cheaper than a new one and sometimes much more expensive. I try to arrive at a price somewhere in the middle. “If people protest, I say, when you buy a secondhand car, you don’t know if it’s been well looked after and maintained. But you can see with a book that it’s all there, the author’s thoughts, the company that printed it.” He holds up a book. “This is a masterpiece of anthropology; the author dedicated his life to this work, but this book was on sale for €9 (£7.55). I’d ask €15 or €20. If people don’t want to pay that, it’s all the same to me. Unless it’s a student and I know they’re going to read it, then they can have it at any price.” Costa’s collection – and there are plenty more books at home, he says – represents a lifetime of travel and curiosity and must be hard to part with. “I know I can’t leave my son with 10,000 books in the house,” he says. “Of course, it hurts to sell them, but it’s a painful obligation.”",News/World news,‘They can’t all go to my son’: the bookshop selling one man’s lifetime collection,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/barcelona-bookshop-gracia-albert-costa
4/22/2022,"The nature guides are waiting outside a Taiwanese fried sausage shop on the outskirts of Taipei, easily identified by their quick-dry clothing, microphones, and laminated sheets of QR codes. They are also carrying several enlarged photos of insects. A group of about 50 excited people soon gathers, ready to start trudging up a nearby mountain in the dark. It is a ritual repeated across Taiwan at this time of year, as hundreds of thousands of people flock to more than 30 sites like this one, in Xindian. They gather in the hope of witnessing the twinkling lights of fireflies, a natural phenomenon that is beautiful, captivating, and under threat. The guides say they can’t guarantee the group will see any, but people are hopeful. The conditions are ideal: a last burst of winter gave up overnight and it’s clearand muggy. “If we see the fireflies, we’re lucky. If we don’t, we’re hiking,” says the guide. The lights the group is looking for are a firefly courtship routine lasting just two to four weeks, as males show off to potential mates by making their abdomens glow green or a warm red. As dusk settles the first of dozens of groups with dozens of people – from toddlers in prams to elderly couples – begin the 90-minute hike along the Hemeishan trail through an abandoned amusement park and into the jungle. On the walk up, observers rush to a ditch to marvel at the first sighting: just two or three fireflies hovering around the undergrowth. But by the time night has fallen and the walkers have stumbled their way to trail peak’s plateau, they are surrounded by blinking lights dancing over marshy ponds in the darkness. Taiwan is home to about 65 of the world’s estimated 2,200 species of firefly. In terms of density, it ranks behind only Jamaica and Costa Rica, with two species for every 1,000 square kilometre. But global populations are under threat from habitat destruction and pesticides, as well as water, air and light pollution. “The fundamental problem is visibility,” wrote Tufts University firefly experts, Avalon CS Owens and Sara Lewis, in the Conversation last year. “Fireflies use their bioluminescence to flirt in the dark. It doesn’t work so well with the lights on.” Climate change is also a concern, says Dr Wu Chiahsiung, an expert on fireflies from the National Taiwan University. “[Fireflies] like to hatch in a wet and humid area, so if climate change makes a place too dry [they won’t hatch].” He notes the Taiwan drought of 2020-2021, its worst in 50 years. But conservationists and volunteers are fighting to save them. In the centre of the Taipei, conservationists with the Friends of Daan Forest Park Foundation have successfully reintroduced fireflies after almost a century. In 2014, the group formed under Wu’s training to restore natural habitats, replace bright streetlights with firefly-friendly globes, and lead tour groups. Their success has led to delegations from Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok visiting to learn from them. They run the nightly tours during the season, with as many as 500 people on weekdays, and 1,000 at weekends. “It’s a childhood memory for those over 50, and before 2014 many of them thought it would be impossible to see them again,” says Wu. “We brought them back. It’s an ecological miracle.” There is massive community interest. A review of pre-pandemic firefly tourism estimated at least one million people travelled annually to sites across 12 countries to see the fireflies each year, including hundreds of thousands in Taiwan. Conservation groups and guides have worked to minimise the impact, limiting numbers and staggering start times for groups, and encourage people to stick to paths and not use torches, flash photography or wear insect spray. Dozens of people on Hemei mountain are here for the tricky but rewarding photo opportunities. Betty, a retired woman from Taipei, has spent the evening sitting in a small camping chair next to a flat patch of long grass and ferns. Her iPhone stands on a short tripod, its screen displaying a frankly stunning photo taken using a slow shutter app. “It’s just like when people see shooting stars, you’re super-excited. This is only once a year and the time is very short.” In Daan Park, crowds gather in the twilight by the ecological ponds, drawn in by the foundation’s own firefly song – a tune in multiple languages written by winners of a competition with $600,000 in prize money. It plays on a loop. Energy and hopes are high: it’s another warm night and despite a growing Covid outbreak, the usually cautious people of Taipei have turned out in droves. Lou-ann Fu Yen-fen, a retired banker who has volunteered with the foundation for six years, says it’s been an honour to show people the fireflies in the city centre. “I believe in live and learn. For my generation, if we lived in the suburbs we saw the fireflies so naturally. We took it for granted. Young people live in the city and have never seen it before. If they learn to live in harmony with the environment they will treasure it.”",News/World news,‘An ecological miracle’: Taiwan’s fireflies are flirting in the dark again,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/ecological-miracle-fireflies-taiwan-flirting-dark
4/22/2022,"On Tuesday, it was reported that Harry and his wife, Meghan, were invited to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the platinum jubilee. But in an interview with the US network NBC’s Today Show, the duke said he was unsure whether they would accept the invitation. Speaking to the host, Hoda Kotb, he said: “I don’t know yet: there’s lots of things – security issues and everything else. So this is what I’m trying to do, trying to make it possible that … I can get my kids to meet her.” After reports Harry had met the Queen for tea last week, the duke said he wanted to make sure his grandmother was “protected” and had the “right people around her”. “Meghan and I had tea with her, so it was really nice to catch up with her,” he said, adding that he believed his relationship with his grandmother to be “really special” and that she had an amazing sense of humour. When asked what he believed to be her best quality, the duke said: “Her sense of humour and ability to see the humour in so many different things.” The visit to the UK has also been seen as an offer of an olive branch in an effort to rebuild relationships, including with his father. A royal observer said the visit showed Harry “slowly starting to rebuild some bridges with his father” having been critical of him in interviews in the past. Another said the visit was seen as a gesture after the fallout from the Sussexes’ Oprah Winfrey interview last year. During that interview, the duke said he had felt “let down” by Prince Charles and that he did not return his phone calls for a period of time. Harry told NBC he felt the “presence” of Diana, Princess of Wales, in everything he did, and that he had spoken to his son, Archie, about Grandma Diana. He said the presence of his mother had felt constant over the past two years especially. “It’s almost as though she’s done her bit with my brother, and now she’s very much helping me. She’s got him set up, and now she’s helping me set up. That’s what it feels like. “He’s got his kids, I’ve got my kids … I feel her presence in almost everything that I do now, but definitely more so in the last two years than ever before, without a question.” During the NBC interview, when asked by Kotb whether he thought the Queen may be bored of her 96th birthday, Harry replied: “I think so.” But when asked the same question about her jubilee celebrations, he appeared to change his tune, saying: “No. I don’t think so. She’s had a few jubilees now and every one is slightly different. I’m sure she is looking forward to it.”",News/UK news,Olive branches and Grandma Diana: what we learned about Prince Harry this week,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/prince-harry-diana-nbc-interview
4/22/2022,"Thatcherism is rightly remembered and cited as the cause of many of the ills that dog us to this day. David Cameron might not be acknowledged to be worthy of an “ism” so far, but his time in office has been as damaging as that of Margaret Thatcher. Perhaps it is because his policies have taken time to show their true long-term destructive effects. The poor insulation of so many of our houses should have been improved years ago – with massive payback now – but that initiative was dismissed by him as “green crap”. The legacy of this is the antipathy shown towards energy saving measures in the recent “energy strategy”. The indiscriminate cutting of so-called red tape at all costs by his government, with the “one in, one/two/three out” mandate for new regulations (along with a desire not to upset the building industry), appears likely to have contributed to the severity of the Grenfell Tower fire. Hundreds of properties and thousands of people are still at risk because safety was sacrificed so that businesses could prosper. The snowball effects of the austerity measures introduced by Cameron’s chancellor, George Osborne, are still – and increasingly – inflicting damage on the physical and mental health of so many. Finally, for the time being, the simplistic EU membership referendum and its unplanned-for outcome is another slowly unfolding disaster for the United Kingdom, the full and true cost of which will possibly never be reckoned. Perhaps “Cameronism” will one day be acknowledged as a thing and commemorated in the fullness of time – in some hall of shame.Stuart PringleAlyth, Perth and Kinross  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
