3/14/2022,"Tenants already struggling with the cost of living crisis typically face having to find an extra £1,000 this year to cover higher rent and essential bills, research shows. The estate agent Hamptons said tenants’ finances faced a record squeeze as higher rents and energy bill increases combined to pile more pressure on households in Great Britain. Recent research from other property firms such as Rightmove has already shown that rents have been rising at their fastest rate on record as tenants making plans for a post-pandemic life jostle for properties. In its latest monthly lettings index, Hamptons said this strong growth led to the average household in Great Britain spending 42% of their post-tax income on rent in 2021 – the highest proportion since its records began in 2010. When other costs such as gas, electricity, council tax, broadband and a TV licence were included, it meant a typical household spent 52% of their post-tax income on rent and bills in 2021. This figure is set to climb further as the cost of living crisis deepens. By the end of this year, Hamptons predicts that the average rented household will be spending a record 54% of their post-tax income on rent and bills. This will typically cost them an extra £1,008 this year alone, with their total outlay set to rise to £17,914 – up from £16,906 in 2021. The 2022 figure includes an estimated £4,015 for household bills, compared with £3,350 in 2021. Private rents are still rising, with the new report putting the average monthly cost of a newly let property in Great Britain at £1,118 in February. That was 6.7% or £70 higher than 12 months earlier. The annual rate of rental growth has gradually been coming down over the past few months – in July 2021 it was running at 8.7% – and Hamptons expects it to slow to about 2.5% by the end of this year. However, the latest national figure disguises wide regional variations. In south-east England and outer London, average rents are 1.5% to 3% higher than a year ago, and in the south-west they are up by 13%. During the coronavirus pandemic, some tenants quit London and other big cities after deciding they wanted to live in the suburbs, the countryside or near the sea. Others are planning to do so. Aneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons, said: “Financial pressures are raining down on households but while last year it was rental growth that ate into tenants’ incomes, this year it’s more likely to be energy costs.” She said that with more income tied up in essentials, it was likely that discretionary spending was set to fall later this year, which she noted was “bad news for the wider economy”.",News/Business,"Tenants face having to find extra £1,000 for 2022 rent and bills",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/14/tenants-face-having-to-find-extra-1000-for-2022-rent-and-bills
3/14/2022,"Boris Johnson has announced that the government will donate more than 500 mobile generators to Ukraine to help provide power for key buildings such as hospitals, shelters and water treatment plants. The UK government has set up a new Ukraine electricity network support taskforce, including many of the leading power suppliers. They will provide the generators from their stocks, with many expected to be delivered via neighbouring countries. In total, they should provide enough power for 20,000 homes or equivalent buildings. The prime minister said: “We are seeing the tragic consequences in Ukraine from [Vladimir] Putin’s grave mistake every day, and we will continue to do everything we can to support Ukraine’s resistance against this illegal invasion through economic, diplomatic and humanitarian measures, as well as providing defensive military equipment. “We will now be sending generators to ease the difficulties caused by the current power outages and help keep vital services running so the people of Ukraine can continue to defend their country.” The government said the plan emerged from recent discussions held between the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, Johnson and the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. Kwarteng said: “Sending portable electricity generators to Ukraine will help keep essential services running, weaken Putin’s attempts to cripple Ukraine’s power supply, and help support the extraordinarily brave Ukrainian response to the Kremlin’s war waging.” Zelenskiy made a powerful address to MPs by video link to the House of Commons last week, citing Shakespeare and Churchill. He urged the government to ramp up sanctions against Russia and back a no-fly zone over his country. “Please increase the pressure of sanctions against this country [Russia] and please recognise this country as a terrorist country. Please make sure that our Ukrainian skies are safe. Please make sure that you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country,” he said. However, the UK, in common with the EU and US, has rejected the idea of a no-fly zone for fear that it could spark a direct military conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Instead, the UK has continued to provide military equipment to Ukrainian forces. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said last week that it would include Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons and Javelin anti-tank missiles. The levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, said on Sunday that Putin had “shown a level of ruthlessness beyond that which any other leader on Earth is capable of at the moment,” warning what had happened in Aleppo, Syria, offered “terrifying portents”. Johnson said last week that Putin may be willing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said on Sunday that any response to such an attack would have to be agreed with Nato. “There is always a chilling risk of escalation that none of us want to see. I think in the middle of a conflict like this we shouldn’t be speculating the what ifs,” he told Sky News. “We have to work in lockstep with our Nato allies, responding as things develop, but at this stage discussing what if, I don’t think is helpful in a conflict like this.”",News/World news,UK to donate more than 500 mobile generators to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/uk-to-donate-more-than-500-mobile-generators-to-ukraine
3/14/2022,"Online shoppers in the UK face more identification checks when paying for purchases on the internet from Monday, as new rules to clamp down on fraud come into force. The new Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements will change the way people confirm their identity when using their debit or credit cards to make online purchases, and are expected to lead to more card payments being declined. It is the biggest change to card payments since chip and pin was rolled out 16 years ago, and is designed to reduce the £376m lost to online fraud in 2020. The measures are similar to those already faced by people logging into online banking. Customers will be asked to prove their identity when making a purchase by confirming two of three “factors”: something they are, for example by providing a fingerprint or facial ID; something they know, such as a passcode or password; or something they have, such as their mobile phone. The two-factor authentication checks mean that customers may be asked to verify a purchase via a one-time passcode sent by text message, which they then have to enter on screen. Other confirmations include answering an automated phone call to a landline or mobile or signing into a banking app. Some types of transactions are exempt from the requirements, mainly purchases deemed at “low risk” of fraudulent activity, such as when buying low-cost items, or repeated purchases such as subscriptions. High value purchases, or those outside a buyer’s normal spending habits or transacted on a previously unused device, are likely to prompt the extra security checks. Mastercard expects about 25% of online transactions to require some form of extra verification by the customer from Monday, compared with only 1% of online purchases previously. Some card issuers began declining some non-compliant transactions from mid-January as part of the “ramp-up” to SCA’s full implementation. Barclaycard research found that in February, more than 1.2m online transactions worth more than £100m were declined, and retailers lost sales as a result. About 14% of shoppers noticed an increase in their online payments being declined and 37% headed to another retailer to complete their purchase. A spokesperson for the banking and finance industry body, UK Finance, said SCA “is an important tool in the fight against fraud, adding an additional layer of protection when people pay online using a card”. She added: “Customers should make sure their bank has their correct contact details. If a customer has any specific needs, they should contact their bank to discuss what help is available.” The British Retail Consortium said retailers had been getting their systems ready for many months to enable them to process the extra security checks. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the BRC, said: “The BRC and our members have worked with suppliers to ensure multiple fraud checks are performed behind the scenes and any additional friction is kept to a minimum. Customers should be reassured that buying online has never been safer.”",Lifestyle/Money,UK shoppers face more identity checks when buying online,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/14/uk-shoppers-face-more-identity-checks-when-buying-online
3/14/2022,"There is a line of Merseyside humour that runs directly to Jonathan Larkin from Alan Bleasdale, Willy Russell and Lily Savage. The author of Cherry Jezebel, a high-velocity comedy about after-hours queer culture, combines the brutal language of a working-class underdog with a heart as big as Liverpool. His is a voice that is black to the point of cruelty, yet also compassionate. It would be camp if it were not so vicious; sentimental if it were not so funny. He gets laughs from cancer and suicide, but reserves his real anger for a world that is violently intolerant of those who wander from the heterosexual norm. It starts in the ladies loos of a city-centre gay bar, like a gender-fluid Stags and Hens, the Russell comedy that premiered here at the Everyman in 1978. Mickey Jones as Cherry Brandy is a drag queen celebrating winning the MerseyPride Icon award. Preening and self-indulgent, she lauds it over best friend Heidi Handjob (Mariah Louca) while firing off scatter-gun put-downs of newcomer Pearl Reckless (Stefan Race) and token straight guy Mo (George Jones). In James Baker’s production, the cast are all bravado and invective, laying into each other with an unyielding sense of pace. No joke goes by without being topped by another more merciless, still. No cutting comment goes unreturned, barbed and primed to hurt. Yet, however pummelling their delivery, it is a front. Whether gay, transgender, non-binary or just curious, they use attack as the best form of defence. Behind the facade, they are as vulnerable as anyone, whether damaged by the rejection of their families or physically abused by insecure lovers. As the simple impressionism of Ellie Light’s bathroom set switches to the cluttered realism of Cherry’s front room (the upstairs bedroom is an unwieldy distraction), we enter a long, darkly comic night of the soul. Larkin writes angrily about the violence meted out to his characters, but he is also withering about their shortcomings. Cherry, in particular, is too narcissistic to be a true friend, her affections as superficial as the wig she discards. Yet for all the bleakness, the play remains uplifting, as if there is nothing a chorus of Set You Free can’t cure.  At Everyman, Liverpool, until 26 March.",Arts/Stage,Cherry Jezebel – Liverpool’s drag queens offer a darkly comic night of the soul,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/14/cherry-jezebel-everyman-liverpool-jonathan-larkin
3/14/2022,"Joanna Lumley’s two-year stint as Baftas host was not a happy one – the prolific and brutal slaughter of gags was worthy of a Quentin Tarantino movie. Could Rebel Wilson, who brought the house down a couple of years ago ripping into Cats, do any better? Well, she scored a few direct hits. For instance (on her weight loss) “I’ve had quite a transformation – I hope JK Rowling still approves” and her gag about Will Smith’s open marriage. Balanced against that, however, was the cringey “back to the cinema” skit, which seemed mainly to be an opportunity to cram in a pixellated shot of her naked from the waist down along with various euphemisms for going for a dump. The gags about how many actors in the audience she wanted to shag also got a little stale … literally, when she brought out a cake of Benedict Cumberbatch’s face. AN For a while, back last autumn, Belfast looked like the film to beat this awards season. Kenneth Branagh’s drama tickled the Academy’s favour in a similar fashion to Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma: black and white, coming-of-age, cineaste autobiographical. But then it dipped. Other films built up a head of steam and Belfast looked increasingly doomed. Now, it rises once more, its spell out of the limelight re-energising the race and endearing it to anyone slightly jaded by big skies and conflicted cowboys. Branagh was popular on Sunday night, delivering a warm, button-pushing, fight-the-good-fight rallying cry for cinemas – and he’s even more popular in Hollywood. A good outside punt. CS Every awards year seems to have a little movie that could; Coda is the one that has got the nod this time. A remake of a fairly obscure French film, entrusted to a director with a pretty short CV, it has ridden a wave of excitement for its emotive narrative arc and its discovery of a veteran talent in Troy Kotsur, only the second deaf actor to be up for an Oscar (after Marlee Matlin, who plays his wife in the movie). Coda seemed to have inspired real affection within the industry if the roars of approval greeting its two wins tonight were anything to go by. Director Sian Heder will be up against the same crew on Oscar night for best adapted screenplay; she may not repeat the trick, but Kotsur now looks nailed on for best supporting actor. AP The Power of the Dog will win the Oscars for best picture and director – that’s written in stone. Not just because, despite failing to take any other Baftas, it still won those two, but because it has now won every single picture prize going. And on Saturday Jane Campion won the Directors Guild America award – the most reliable bellwether of the Academy Awards. So: done deal. But aside from those categories – and the actor awards, with Will Smith and Troy Kotsur being locks – there’s still lots to play for in the next fortnight. Might Coda and Licorice Pizza go home with the screenplay awards (there was a lot of love for the latter at Bafta)? CS It’s when you come to the best actress categories that the Baftas and Oscars really struggle to correlate. Joanna Scanlan, who won the Bafta, isn’t up for the Oscar but Olivia Colman and Kristen Stewart – both snubbed by Bafta – both are. Is it too soon for more Colman? Might Jessica Chastain’s shocked speech at the SAGs have won her sufficient favour to take it? Or does Nicole Kidman’s Lucille Ball tick the right boxes? Meanwhile, Judi Dench’s advanced years and treasure status could mean she gets a second supporting actress Oscar, though the smart money must be on Ariana DeBose – whose charming speech on Sunday can only have helped her cause. CS While No Time to Die only won a single award – for best editing – Bond loomed large over the ceremony. Rebel Wilson showed her Daniel Craig tattoo, Troy Kotsur was asked about the possibility of a deaf Bond and Shirley Bassey opened the show by singing Diamonds Are Forever. It’s 60 years since the first Bond film, and Bassey is now 85 – but her commitment to glamour and drama remain unshaken, and indeed unstirred, by the passing of time. It was rather moving. AN What was the night’s best performance? Rebel Wilson’s finger-waggling smutfest? Dame Shirley’s rafter-shattering vamping? Troy Kotsur’s engaging pitch for 008? I’d argue it was the amazingly graceful sign-language interpreters, who accompanied Kotsur and his director Sian Heder on stage when they picked up their awards – and even more splendidly accompanying Emilia Jones’ performance of the song from the movie. They really raised the level of the show. AP Now the Golden Globes are out of the picture, the road would appear clear for the Baftas as the unarguable silver-medal position in the awards race (with the Oscars still defeating all comers). But Bafta’s relationship with the US Academy is still tricky: it’s both saucer-eyed at its counterpart’s wattage and wants to assert its own homegrown traditions. Even if Joanna Scanlan’s triumph as best actress demonstrated a bit of independent thinking, some of the other decisions show the boot is still on the Oscar foot. That’s the only way to explain Ariana DeBose winning over Jessie Buckley (a result even DeBose didn’t see coming), and Will Smith defeating Benedict Cumberbatch (the latter taking it gracefully). And the number of awards presented to no-shows told its own story; pitching for Oscar votes is a demanding business. AP With war raging in Ukraine, it seemed likely that a succession of stars would take the opportunity to share their thoughts about the crisis. Perhaps aware of the dissonance between a glitzy awards show and the horror of the invasion, however, few did. Rebel Wilson showed us the “universal sign language” for Putin – a raised middle finger. Andy Serkis made a convoluted joke about Priti Patel. Benedict Cumberbatch indicated on the red carpet that he wanted to be part of the “homes for Ukraine” scheme. Many wore blue and yellow badges to show their support. But grandstanding, in the main, was conspicuous by its absence.
