1/5/2022,"A TikToker is going viral after sharing footage of a “missing staircase” that allegedly left her trapped in her apartment for hours. The post, from user Olivia Crump (@foodbattle2008), is just the latest in a long line of viral videos centered on strange apartment features. In the past, TikTokers have shared a New York apartment with a “nauseating” hallway, a college living space with “secret caves” inside and an apartment that allegedly had “moving” chairs in its backyard. Thankfully, Crump’s fiasco was only temporary. As she explained in her video’s comment section, her building’s management “removed” the stairs for several hours, seemingly for some kind of repair. “When your apartment removes the stairs without warning and you’re stuck for hours,” she captioned the post.  In the short video, Crump shows a full flight missing from her building’s outdoor stairwell. In the comments, she claimed this was the only way to exit her complex.  Many commenters were stunned by the situation. Some accused Crump of lying about it being the only stairwell. Achieve In The Know cover star Storm Reid's makeup look for less than $20 “Most buildings in the U.S. need two exits,” one user wrote. “I’m gonna say this is a joke.” However, others seemed to stick with Crump’s story, sharing her outrage.  “That is crazy unsafe,” one user wrote.  “That doesn’t seem safe,” another agreed. “Call the fire marshall,” another suggested.  Others pointed out a much more serious issue — accessibility. As many noted, the staircase’s removal could be a serious problem for wheelchair users or people with limited mobility.  “I’m in a wheelchair,” one commenter shared. “And one time my university removed the sidewalk to the only entrance to the building w an elevator and put a 5-foot trench there.” It remains unclear how long Crump’s staircase stayed that way or whether there was any other sort of way out of the complex. Either way, it makes for some pretty wild footage.  Rupaul's Drag Race' winner Symone dishes her post-drag skincare secrets More from In The Know: If sitting for too long hurts your back, grab this seat cushion that Amazon shoppers love while it’s on sale This Yule Chocolate Log is a holiday favorite 7 top-rated subscription gifts that keep on giving Etiquette influencer Pattie Ehsaei is TikTok’s ‘Duchess of Decorum’ The post Woman blown away after discovering ‘crazy’ renovation inside her apartment complex appeared first on In The Know.",U.S./In The Know by Yahoo,Woman blown away after discovering ‘crazy’ renovation inside her apartment complex: ‘That doesn’t seem safe’,https://news.yahoo.com/woman-blown-away-discovering-crazy-174425223.html

1/5/2022,"If the House flips in 2022, Republicans will likely consider ""multiple grounds"" for impeaching for President Biden, Sen. Ted. Cruz (R-Texas) predicted on the latest episode of his podcast Verdict with Ted Cruz. Cruz argued that while he regrets that impeachment proceedings have become routine, Democrats bear the blame for turning impeachment into a political weapon, The Washington Times reports. ""I do think there's a chance of [impeachment] … whether it's justified or not,"" Cruz said in response to a question from co-host Michael Knowles. ""The Democrats weaponized impeachment. They used it for partisan purposes to go after Trump because they disagreed with him … Democrats decided [impeachment] is just another tool in the partisan war chest."" The House has passed articles of impeachment three times in the past 30 years, once against President Clinton while under Republican control and twice against President Trump. The Democrat-controlled House first impeached Trump in 2019 for withholding aid to Ukraine in an attempt to solicit damaging information about then-candidate Joe Biden. He was impeached a second time in 2021 for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Cruz voted against convicting Trump both times. In the 209 years following the adoption of the current U.S. Constitution in 1789, the House impeached only one president — Andrew Johnson. All four presidential impeachments have resulted in acquittal by the Senate. Some Republicans are already chomping at the bit to impeach Biden. The day after Biden took office, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed articles of impeachment claiming that Biden had abused his power while vice president in order to ""bail out his son, Hunter, and line his family's pockets with cash from corrupt foreign energy companies."" Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings from 2014 until 2019. Greene has since filed additional articles of impeachment against Biden for extending the COVID-19 eviction moratorium, failing to control illegal immigration, and for ""dereliction of duty"" in the withdrawal from Afghanistan. None of these articles have been voted on by the House Judiciary Committee. Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) also said before the Afghanistan withdrawal that Biden should be impeached if any American citizens were left behind, Business Insider reported.

1/5/2022,"""Due dates are just a suggestion, babies will always come on their birthday."" Pregnant supermodel Ashley Graham kicked off the new year by sharing a photo on her Instagram account with a caption celebrating an almost unheard-of milestone. Graham, who shares an almost 2-year-old son with husband Justin Ervin, has reached her 40-week due date while pregnant with twin boys. Almost immediately after posting the photos, Graham's comment section was filled with a combination of love and support and calls of worry and distress. Many fans questioned whether carrying to 40 weeks is dangerous for mothers who are expecting multiples, and not without reason: According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, less than half of twin pregnancies reach 37 weeks. Dr. Christine Greves, a board-certified OB/GYN at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies, says it's certainly an anomaly for women who are pregnant with multiples to remain pregnant up until their due date. ""I've been doing this for almost 20 years and I've seen less than a handful of women pregnant with twins make it to 40 weeks,"" Greves shares, explaining the reasons twins may be delivered earlier are multifold. For starters, there's not as much room for two babies inside a woman's uterus as there is for one. ""The uterus is accustomed to getting to a '40-weeks' size and with twins, it typically should measure much farther along much earlier because there's one uterus for two babies,"" Greves tells Yahoo Life. ""Many women will give birth [earlier than 40 weeks] because that's when the uterus is ready and that's when it begins to contract."" Other complications like preeclampsia, diabetes, cord entanglement and selective growth restriction, a condition in which one twin does not receive enough nourishment from the placenta to grow at a normal rate, are just the start of a list of reasons why women and their doctors rarely see twin pregnancies go to full term. But that doesn't mean a 40-week multiple-birth pregnancy like Graham's is unsafe. ""If there's regular prenatal care, she's under the care of her doctors, she doesn't have any risk factors and the babies are looking great during screenings — if her doctors say it is safe — then I would trust that,"" says Greves. Greves adds that with any pregnancy, doctors typically do not recommend going past 41 weeks because from there the morbidity rate increases for both mother and child. The Florida-based OB/GYN explains that, according to the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the optimal time to give birth is around 38 weeks to avoid major complications. ""Although the data recommends delivery at 38 weeks, that's a recommendation,"" Greves emphasizes. ""And what the patient decides they are comfortable with regarding their risk level for themself and their baby — that's up to them and their doctor."" While rare, there are mothers who carry healthy twins to 40 weeks and beyond. Viktorya Howard is a mom of three who carried her twin daughters, Sierrah and Savannah, now 22, to 42 weeks. ""I had no health issues during my pregnancy,"" says the Kettering, Ohio mom. ""Savannah was about 4 pounds, 12 ounces at birth, and Sierrah was exactly 5 pounds."" ""I had a midwife who was amazing,"" Howard continues. ""She never pressured me to deliver earlier: She added weekly stress tests to make sure the girls were both doing well but she always assured me that the girls would come when they were ready."" Greves says, like any other pregnancy, the only people truly able to judge the health of a multiple birth pregnancy are parents and the medical provider they've chosen to provide prenatal care. ""It's incredibly rare that a woman with twins or multiple gestations has the gift of making it to her due date,"" Greaves explains. ""Because twins have a higher risk of causing complications, it may result in an earlier delivery."" Still, Greves says it's unlikely Graham's fans have anything to worry about. ""[In Graham's case],"" Greves adds, ""I would feel comfortable assuming there is proper medical care.""",Health/Yahoo Life,"'Due dates are just a suggestion': Ashley Graham shares full-term pregnancy photo, but is it safe to carry twins to 40 weeks?
