2/11/2022,"The first surprise of The Tinder Swindler, Netflix’s hit film and the only documentary to have topped its global most-watched list, is that anyone is still using Tinder. The “swindler” of the title is preposterous in every way, but he chose his victims well: women in their early 30s blinded to the absurdity of a “billionaire’s son” using that dusty old dating app, which has no door policy. The second thing to say about this engrossing film is that any online dating scam that results in a woman merely being defrauded of her savings, rather than robbed of her life, practically qualifies as comedy.  In fact, there are comic episodes. The story unfurls like a jaw-dropping, real-life version of Catch Me If You Can. “Simon Leviev”, the eponymous villain, looks like a member of the A-Team who just emerged from a costume shop wearing that timeless ensemble Heir to a Diamond Fortune. It’s testament to the suspension of disbelief that drives so much online dating that photos of a man posing on a yacht, in a helicopter or leaning against the bonnet of a sports car inspire some women to think, “He looks nice!” rather than, “That’s clearly fake.” Or, more helpfully perhaps: “He looks like an arsehole.” It’s not just about the money. After the story blew up, online commentators pegged Leviev’s victims as gold-diggers who got what they deserved, but the reality is much sadder. “Oh my God, animals,” says one of Leviev’s victims, remembering the Tinder profile that reeled her in. “A handsome man with a cat? You can’t go wrong.” It’s hard to write in detail about the scam without spoiling the film. But what it says, broadly, about the (straight) dating market confirms truths about men and women that, in more optimistic moments, one might have thought out of date. It is revealing that the one woman in the film who is not, apparently, defrauded, is a 22-year-old, whom Leviev was “lucky” to snag in the first place. Most of us know this simply from being alive: that something happens in online dating when straight women leave their 20s, and which I have watched friends go through with horror. One said to me recently, in despair, “Realistically, I’m looking at widowers, mid-60s and up”. (She is 47.) The only man in her age group who engaged with her sent a photo of himself sprawled on the hood of a Ford Discovery and asked if she was interested in travelling to New Jersey. She’s not flying to Bulgaria with a guy after a single coffee or handing over her passport details if he asks. But the vulnerability that comes from years of exposure to men her age looking for women at least 10 years her junior can put a finger on the scales of one’s judgment. Yet, even with this in mind, the sheer size of the red flags over Leviev make one yell at the screen. What is the point of doing all those “Am I dating a narcissist?” quizzes if, when it comes down to it, you don’t clock the oversharing and love-bombing on the first date? “Very quickly, he became very personal, and that’s what I liked about it,” says one victim, and you know she’s in for it, even before she says, “Here’s this kind of person that you want to save.” (I have dated people I wanted to save and, to a woman, they have all been nightmares, but watching this I felt only relief. Women are awful – but have you met men?) The frightening thing about some stripes of conmen is the degree to which they believe their own bullshit. It feels like one of those truths handed down the generations from woman to woman, like never corner a squirrel in an attic; or, in this case, never confront a deluded man with evidence of his delusions, or he is liable to fly at you, eyes popping. Thank God for the heroes of this story, a team of Norwegian journalists who track Leviev halfway across the globe, and a Dutch woman who, on discovering precisely what she is dating, pulls off a counter-scam that you can hardly believe you’re seeing. This woman should have a statue raised in her honour. Instead, the conclusion is a little underwhelming. In fiction, a Wicker Man-type fate might await Leviev. One can imagine what a writer like Fay Weldon would do with him. In reality, public exposure will have to suffice. Having served two short prison sentences – neither for the crimes alleged by the women in the film – he is currently living as a free man in Israel. For a man who apparently doesn’t feel shame, this doesn’t seem adequate. Still, there are downsides. As the popularity of the film soared this week, Tinder announced that Leviev was banned from its app. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion, The Tinder Swindler reveals the painful truth about women and online dating | Emma Brockes,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/10/tinder-swindler-women-online-dating-netflix
2/11/2022,"The government has announced an immediate review of fairness in the pig industry supply chain, and has promised to look into pig contracts, in response to a worsening crisis in the sector, as an estimated 200,000 pigs are backed up on farms and unable to be taken to slaughter. Farming minister Victoria Prentis made the announcement following a summit with pig producers on Thursday to discuss ways to solve the continuing crisis in domestic pig production.  The National Pig Association (NPA) chair, Rob Mutimer, and the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, last month requested an urgent summit to address labour and supply-chain concerns in the pig industry, as well as financial difficulties faced by producers. “The effects on pig farmers have been devastating, and it is clear that many contractual arrangements are simply unfair,” Prentis said. Prentis said ministers want to engage with the pig industry on how fairness and transparency could be improved, with a consultation expected later in the year. In addition, measures introduced by government in the autumn to support pig producers – including permitting foreign butchers to enter the UK on temporary visas, longer working hours at processing plants and a scheme allowing producers to store pig carcasses for several months before processing – have recently been extended until the end of March. Pig producers are warning that the British pig industry is fighting for survival. They had called on government to hold a summit because they said the previously announced support measures had delivered “minimal benefit”. “The situation is dire,” said Mutimer, ahead of the summit. “Getting the backlog down by the summer will simply be too late for many pig farmers. This is a crisis unfolding in front of our eyes – and we must act collectively now to save the British pig industry.” The number of pigs stranded on farms has been rising since the industry began to sound the alarm last autumn, and has almost doubled from 120,000 to nearly 200,000. The backlog of pigs increased rapidly over the festive period when staff took holidays or had to isolate with Covid. Meanwhile the cull of healthy pigs on farms continues, with an estimated 35,000 animals killed since September, according to the NPA, although it warns that the actual number is likely to be higher. Pigs are backing up on farms because of a lack of staff at the abattoirs where they are slaughtered. Only 100 of the 800 temporary butcher visas granted by government have been taken up so far, the NPA said. It has called on ministers to simplify the visa application process and ease the English language requirement to make it easier to recruit trained butchers. The NPA had also requested government consider giving financial support to the worst-affected producers, which it says has been provided in Scotland and in EU countries. The association has called on retailers to play a role in supporting producers, including through a mass promotion of British pork. Ahead of the summit, pig farmers from the UK gathered in York to raise awareness about the challenges they are facing. Farmers have been forced to kill animals to make space and ensure the continued welfare of their livestock. The meat industry is one of many sectors of the UK economy grappling with labour shortages linked to Brexit and the pandemic, while a lack of delivery workers and drivers has affected supply chains. “I personally know of another 1,000 pigs killed a couple of days ago on one farm,” said Duncan Berkshire, a pig vet in Yorkshire who also attended Thursday’s summit. “It is just devastating for everyone involved.” Berkshire added: “In the last three months of visits I haven’t had a single client where there isn’t a problem on the farm that can’t be put down to the fact that pig flow has been interrupted. “The pigs I am seeing at the minute are the biggest I have ever seen and the tightest packed together.”",News/Business,"UK pig industry review announced as 200,000 animals stranded on farms",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/uk-pig-industry-review-announced-as-200000-animals-stranded-on-farms
2/11/2022,"After funding the first wave of Covid-19 vaccine research, the country music star and beloved celebrity Dolly Parton is now spreading the gift of education. The country singer’s company recently announced that her theme parks will pay for its employees to pursue a college degree.  Starting 24 February, employees at Dollywood who pursue a college degree will have their tuition, associated fees and books 100% covered by the Dollywood theme park. The offer also includes all 11,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees that work at any of the 25 amusement parks and attractions under Herschend Enterprises, Dollywood’s parent company, including Dollywood. Under the Grow U program, the new education pilot initiative, employees can register for a higher learning program on their first day through 30 offered learning partners, with subjects ranging from marketing, technology and other studies. Grow U has also committed to partially funding 150 additional degree programs that include art design, engineering and hospitality, covering up to $5,250. “When our hosts feel appreciated and are given opportunities like this, they feel cared for and they can pass that feeling on to their guests,” said Wes Ramey, a spokesman for Dollywood Co, to the Washington Post. Ramey also confirmed to the Post that the program had Parton’s full support, adding: “She’s very supportive of the employees learning and continuing to grow themselves.” While other companies have previously offered education incentive programs for their employees, many such initiatives have been scaled back or on a smaller scale compared with the Dollywood program, according to the Post.

2/11/2022,"Forty-five years ago this month, Fleetwood Mac released Rumours, an album that combined gauzy soft pop, manicured folk and stormy rock with a soap-operatic level of intra-band strife. It won album of the year at the Grammys, went 20 times platinum in the US alone, and sits alongside Kind of Blue and The Rite of Spring in the Library of Congress’s registry of historically significant recordings. “What’s truly remarkable, though, is how it continues to sell new physical copies, despite being available to stream and in secondhand form in every high-street charity shop. According to the UK’s Official Charts Company, Rumours sold 34,593 vinyl copies in 2021, third only to new albums by Adele and Abba, and besting new records by Ed Sheeran and Lana Del Rey. It sold 32,508 copies the previous year. It is currently at No 29 in its 926th week on the UK album chart – up five places from the week before – while in the US, Rumours sold 6,000 vinyl copies in the last week of January, reaching No 1 on the vinyl albums chart. It sold 169,000 vinyl copies in the US in 2021 (according to MRC Data).  For Brittany Spanos, a senior writer at Rolling Stone, its ongoing popularity has a simple explanation. “It’s a fantastic pop album with classically written pop songs: that never goes out of style.” Those songs emerged from long, meticulous studio sessions punctuated by romantic tension and heavy drug use. Keyboardist-singer Christine McVie was dating Fleetwood Mac’s lighting director in the wake of her marriage to bassist John McVie, while singers Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were ending their long-term relationship: the LP feels like every stage of a relationship breakup all at once. “The distinct personalities of the songwriters come through really raw; they’re communicating with each other in heartbreaking, angry ways,” says Zoë Howe, author of the book Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams and Rumours. Adds Spanos: “You’re getting the great theatre of heartbreak from multiple sides.” Phil Barton, owner of Sister Ray Records in Soho, London, says Rumours is a “must-stock item – we sell hundreds of copies every year. It never seems to tail off”. He also credits the wider vinyl boom – sales have increased every year for 14 years in the UK – as part of Rumours’ endurance: “People seeking out classics will inevitably include Rumours as part of their collection.” This rings true to Rupert Morrison, owner of Drift, a record shop in Totnes, Devon: “If you had any anxiety of getting back into vinyl, or you wanted to have that implied credibility, it’s a safe bet,” he says. “It’s this implied [idea]: ‘It’s a classic.’” Rumours’ songs have also become modern standards: Florence + the Machine and country supergroup the Highwomen have tackled The Chain, while Kacey Musgraves covered Dreams on her 2022 US tour. The Los Angeles duo Fleetmac Wood create more elaborate interpretations via inventive remixes. “The original production of Dreams, with the hypnotic looped drums, is essentially a prototype modern dance record,” says co-founder Lisa Jelliffe (AKA Roxanne Roll). Fleetmac Wood’s dance-friendly sets cover all Mac eras, although Jelliffe sees why Rumours continues to fascinate. “A lot of modern pop releases feel like marketing compared to the authenticity of Rumours,” she says. “[The band] knew what they created together was bigger than the personal turmoil. This album is incredibly meaningful for people, and it’s healing to take that to the dancefloor.” Nicks’s pop cultural resilience is another explanation. In 2020, the Nicks-penned Dreams returned to the charts after a man named Nathan Apodaca posted a TikTok video of himself vibing to the song while skateboarding and drinking cranberry juice. (The clip spawned countless homages, including one from Mick Fleetwood himself.) Nicks has also acted in American Horror Story, launched a well-received solo tour, and earned a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction as a solo artist; younger artists such as Miley Cyrus are influenced by her to the point of explicit homage, and she has a high-profile friendship with Harry Styles. “People appreciate Stevie Nicks as an inspirational wise elder of rock’n’roll, but also acknowledge her songwriting more than ever,” Howe says, “rather than just seeing her superficially as this charismatic, stylish singer that everyone had a crush on.” One Rumours fan, 15-year-old Jane Wagle, had her interest in the band piqued by the Dreams TikTok but was inspired to explore Nicks’s work further thanks to Styles’s endorsement. “I know that Harry likes Fleetwood Mac, and I trust him because he likes David Bowie,” she says. “I’m definitely a punk person, a rock person. I wouldn’t expect myself to be that into Fleetwood Mac. But it’s kind of its own thing. It’s really beautiful, and it has its own personality; all the songs are different, but cohesive.” Wagle’s assessment shows there is no simple demographic of who is buying Rumours. Sister Ray’s Barton notes purchasers tend to be female and are “increasingly younger”, but at Chicago’s Reckless Records, where Rumours has been a top seller for the last decade, head buyer Matt Jencik says there’s no typical customer profile. And although Drift’s Morrison says he sees older music fans re-buying Rumours, it’s also difficult for him to pigeonhole buyers. He cites a 24-year-old shop employee: “A lover of extreme music, he still had to admit he had a soft spot for Rumours.” I give Ken Caillat, who co-produced Rumours, the last word on the LP’s staying power. “I think the combination of the young band members – and that half of them were British and half of them were California hippies – and that the lyrics were fuelled by each of the couples breaking up simultaneously, made the songs relatable to people of all ages,” he says. “The band members were only in their 20s, so I suppose their youth and optimism shines through to this day.” Fleetmac Wood play at Troxy, London, on 18 February.",Arts/Music,"Fleetwood Mac: after 926 weeks on the chart, who’s still buying Rumours?",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/10/fleetwood-mac-after-926-weeks-on-the-chart-whos-still-buying-rumours
2/11/2022,"In a timely reminder that respiratory infections are not a modern malaise, researchers have found the first evidence of such an affliction in a dinosaur that lived 150m years ago. Palaeontologists made the discovery when they examined the fossilised neck bones from a diplodocid, a huge, long-necked herbivore that walked the Earth in the late Jurassic period.  Dr Cary Woodruff, director of palaeontology at the Great Plains Dinosaur Museum in Malta, Montana, was inspecting the remains of a dinosaur named Dolly, unearthed in the state more than 30 years ago, when he noticed unusual broccoli-like growths in several of the neck bones. “I’ve looked at a lot of sauropod vertebrae and I’ve seen some weird things, but never anything like these structures,” Woodruff told the Guardian. Stumped by what he found, Woodruff put a call out on social media for anyone who might know what they were. The response was almost immediate. A number of scientists – who went on to join the investigation – said the bony growths looked similar to protrusions that can be caused by respiratory infections in modern birds. Detailed CT scans of the neck bones backed up the suspicion. The unusual growths were in regions of the neck bones that would have been attached to air sacs which in turn formed part of the dinosaur’s respiratory system. The abnormalities may have formed in response to an infection similar to aspergillosis, which is caused by inhaling mould spores, the researchers write in Scientific Reports. “I imagine that Dolly would have been very much like a sick person: coughing, sneezing, experiencing a fever and out of it,” Woodruff said. “We’ve all had many of the same symptoms, and likely felt just as crummy as Dolly did. I don’t personally know of any fossil I’ve been able to sympathetically relate to more.” Aspergillosis is fatal to modern birds without treatment. “Did Dolly sadly pass away sick and alone? Or did being on its own and visibly so weak paint a ‘bullseye’ for predators? Either way, we can’t say, but I do believe that in one way or another, it ultimately contributed to the death of Dolly,” Woodruff said. The findings will help researchers understand how such illnesses affected dinosaurs. “Dinosaurs, including the giant sauropods, breathed through a bird-like air sac system, where the air passed through the lungs as well as systems of air sacs that penetrated into the backbone. The new discovery shows damage to one of the vertebrae that matches the damage seen in birds today that have suffered from inflammation of the air sacs,” said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate palaeontology at the University of Bristol. “Chickens with airsacculitis can show swollen necks, general lethargy, nasal discharges and coughing. Imagine a 50-tonne dinosaur coughing up great blobs of snot,” he added. “We know so little about the diseases dinosaurs suffered, unless those maladies were somehow able to leave marks on fossil bone,” said Steve Brusatte, professor of palaeontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh. “Here we have evidence that a big long-necked dinosaur had the same type of respiratory infection that many birds have today, and we can infer that because the air sacs birds used to breathe actually leave impressions on the bone. It’s remarkable to envision a dinosaur the size of a jetplane coughing and suffering with the same breathing infection as a pigeon or gull today.”",News/Science,Respiratory infection found in dinosaur that lived 150m years ago,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/10/respiratory-infection-found-in-dinosaur-that-lived-150m-years-ago
2/11/2022,"‘We were close friends for a time, but she was never my best friend. I never felt that I knew her – you know, nobody felt like they knew her that well.” Rachel DeLoache Williams is recalling a friendship she made in her late 20s, back in 2016, beginning at an exclusive nightclub on New York’s Lower East Side. Her new companion was, she says, the opposite of her – a “bold, offbeat, audacious” trustafarian and good-time girl who thought nothing of tipping hundreds of dollars at hotels and restaurants. She seemed keen to be friends with Williams, treating her to lavish dinners and even inviting her to sessions with a personal trainer who had worked with Denzel Washington and Gwen Stefani. However, the party girl’s erratic, forgetful and often entitled behaviour masked something far darker, which is now clear to the former Vanity Fair photo editor. “Any time you have to make excuses for somebody – repeatedly – it’s a good indicator that you should give the relationship space,” she says gravely. “I know much more now about sociopathy, and that enigmatic charm. That’s how the whole charade functions.”  The charade, of course, was that her friend was not the daughter of a German billionaire but rather that of a Russian truck driver, and she was funding her charmed life with ill-gotten gains and bad cheques. Anna Sorokin was a con artist, who scammed businesses, banks and friends out of $275,000 (£203,000), while masquerading as an heiress, “Anna Delvey”, and trying to secure investment for a Soho House-style members’ club. Williams was not only a confidante but also a victim who ended up footing a bill for $62,000 for a trip to Morocco, before spending months trying to claw back her money from Sorokin. Eventually she worked with investigators to apprehend her. Dubbed “the Soho grifter”, Sorokin went on to become a pop culture phenomenon, with the media even charting her courtroom looks (she hired Courtney Love’s stylist, naturally) prior to her imprisonment for between four and 12 years for fraud in 2019. Part of the “unholy trinity” of scammers who have set transatlantic pop culture alight in recent years – along with Fyre festival’s Billy McFarland and blood testing entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes – Sorokin’s story has led to books (Williams wrote one, titled My Friend Anna, which chronicles the agonising effect of the debt on her life), plays (Anna X, starring The Crown’s Emma Corrin, premiered on London’s West End last year) and podcasts (see: the BBC’s Fake Heiress). Now the tale has inspired a TV series, Inventing Anna, written by Shonda Rhimes, creator of moreish hits from Scandal to Bridgerton, based on a viral New York magazine article by journalist Jessica Pressler (whose work also formed the basis of the J-Lo movie Hustlers). The series is pacy and pulpy, with Veep’s Anna Chlumsky starring as Vivian Kent, a Pressler-like writer who works for a magazine named Manhattan – and Ozark’s Julia Garner playing the petulant but charming crook. Inventing Anna is, quite literally, ripped from the headlines: it opens to the swaggering strains of Megan Thee Stallion, as copies of Manhattan fly off printing presses, and the dramatic cat-eye makeup and dishevelled hair of the real Sorokin/Delvey (so memorable, it seems, is the image, that they did not bother to recreate it with Garner). And yet it takes a rather creative tack when handling the story, with each episode warning that it is “completely true, except for the parts that are totally made up”. It covers Kent’s own plight, as she aims to redeem her faltering career by getting the scoop of the decade on the fake heiress. She travels to interview her at Rikers Island prison, while heavily pregnant – lest anyone think this is a series without any emotional heft – and looking as though she may keel over at any second. Through flashbacks, a picture emerges of a conniving thief, a cringe-inducing poseuse, and something of an antiheroine, faking it till she makes it as she looks to secure a $2m bank loan for her business, which never came to pass. Garner is beguiling, her cod-European accent – veering between countries with each word – reportedly approved by Sorokin herself. The overall effect is stylised, soapy and – based on the six episodes released to the press – alternately celebrates and cocks a snook at Sorokin. It opens with a monologue from Garner’s character, describing herself as “an icon, a legend” and describing the viewer as “a big lump of nothing”. With nine hour-long episodes, some viewers may find themselves wondering whether we have, perhaps, hit peak Anna Delvey/Sorokin. Possibly not. Annaliese Griffin wrote a piece for New York magazine’s The Cut last year about the rise of the villain in pop culture, and believes the continued interest in the subject of Inventing Anna stems less from the woman herself and more from people’s curiosity about the world she managed to inveigle herself into. “I’m not sure I would call her a beloved figure, exactly, but the reason she is compelling is that sense of the rules being different for different people,” she says. “If you’re incredibly rich, or connected to rich people, you’re waltzing through the door at a restaurant and being comped or gifted your meals. You can float along in that embrace of money and wealth and power and obliviousness. It confirms to us that there are these different rules, that this world is calculated to keep outsiders out, and that, if you could just figure them out, and crack the code like Anna, you might be able to exist inside it, too.” It is, she believes, particularly seductive for viewers to see someone “taking advantage of the very wealthy – sort of an ‘enemy of my enemy is my friend’ kind of thing”, especially at a time of increased economic precarity. However, Inventing Anna isn’t just about the very wealthy, but also the more ordinary people with whom Sorokin came into contact. Williams had not yet seen the series when we spoke, but expressed her concerns about a semi-fictional treatment of the tale. “[Anna] is getting this entertainment treatment that elevates her and glamorises her in a way that makes this entire situation look like a net positive business venture,” she says. “I like a juicy Shonda Rhimes show, but I think it’s different when it’s based on a true story.” Indeed, Sorokin was paid $320,000 by Netflix for the series (she is believed to have in turn paid this to her creditors). “I have a closer view of things than I care to have,” adds Williams. “But what concerns me today has less to do with me and Anna – it’s more a big-picture concern for this type of entertainment.” Sara Rourke, a psychologist working in LA and London, sees another potentially problematic angle in turning Sorokin/Delvey into an increasingly fictionalised figure. “Anna was blurring the lines between what was real and what was made up, and now people are projecting a narrative of who they think she is. Everybody who watches the show will project all of their experiences, and thoughts and feelings and imagination and fantasies, on to it, about why she did what she did,” says Rourke. “That says as much about the person who those fantasies belong to as they do about her. You can’t take the criminality out of it – people have got hurt in the process of what she’s done – but we maybe don’t see where she may have been the victim, where she’s been hurt and what she’s perpetuating. She’s this ambivalent, love/hate character who has also been commodified in a way.” Problematic as it may be in many ways, Inventing Anna is perhaps the best – and the most apt – way to tell this story on TV. Its semi-fictional form mirrors the way in which Sorokin was divorced from the truth of her own life, while the framing device of a journalist looking for answers acts as a stand-in for everyone who has tried to understand the case for themselves. The reality is that pop culture has now overtaken the story, turning it into a Robin Hood-type legend for the Instagram age. Indeed, Sorokin’s story carries on in the background, now something of a sideshow. She was released from prison in early 2021, on parole until the end of her four-year sentence, and has since been arrested again, for overstaying her visa. In an essay published last week on the US site Insider, written from US immigration custody and titled Erasing Anna, Sorokin rallied against Inventing Anna, asking whether she would “for ever be stuck in a past not entirely of my creation without getting a chance to move on?” Griffin says she didn’t even know that her stint in prison had come to an end, so separate are reality and pop culture. “I read an article about her looking for an apartment,” she says. “I was like, wow – I don’t know how that passed me by.” Inventing Anna is available on Netflix from 11 February; My Friend Anna by Rachel DeLoache Williams is published by Quercus in paperback on 17 February.

2/11/2022,"Iwas 14 when my mother and grandmother announced that I was going to have my clitoris, my labia majora and my labia minora cut out. They said that if I resisted I was a coward. In my culture, the worst thing you can be called is a coward. I was never naive. I grew up as a Maasai girl in Kenya in the 60s and 70s. At some point in my childhood, I became aware that there was a rite of passage into womanhood. I was to have my vulva mutilated by an elderly woman using a blunt instrument. But I was also part of the first generation of Maasai girls to be sent to school, where I met girls from communities who didn’t practise female genital mutilation (FGM). I learned from them that you can grow to be an adult with your vulva intact. That was what I wanted.  I went back to my family and explained I would not be mutilated. My father sided with me: he said it was not necessary. But the village taunted me and said they did not know what to call me if I was not cut: “Would we call you a girl or a woman? Do you want to remain a child all your life? Whom will you marry?” On the day I was mutilated, I was woken up at three in the morning and taken outside, naked, because the villagers believed that if I felt the morning breeze on my body it would cool me and I would bleed less. I saw that the object they would cut me with was not sharp. I was not offered any anaesthesia, but I was told not to cry – your father is in the house, they said, and he should never hear you cry. I was determined to show I was not a coward, so I tried very hard not to show any emotion. As a result, I was cut deeper and I could not stop bleeding. I drifted in and out of consciousness and I was extremely dizzy when I woke up. What replaces your vulva after FGM is extreme scar tissue. I was forbidden from putting my legs together, since the scar tissue could fuse. They tied my legs apart with rope so that they would not touch, even when I slept. I had to remain like that for days as I healed. After being mutilated, I made myself a promise: I would do everything I could to stop this ever happening to another girl. My daughters, and all the daughters of the Maasai, would not be cut. In 1975, the overwhelming majority of women in Narok county in Kenya were genitally mutilated. So, when I and some others decided to act, we knew we had to approach this fight carefully. Usually, a girl is mutilated as preparation for an early marriage, so we went from village to village explaining that, if girls went to school and were not married (and mutilated) at a young age, they would be able to earn money and support their family. We explained that vaginas are sufficiently elastic to squeeze out a baby – but scar tissue cannot stretch in the same way. When a woman tries to push a baby through this scarring, the baby often becomes trapped and is deprived of oxygen. As a result, a disproportionate number of children from communities that practise FGM are brain damaged. We told people that this would be much less likely to happen if we stopped FGM. We continue to run education programmes and workshops, talking not only to women, but also men. If we do not persuade men – and teach them to love their women and their bodies – we cannot win. V-Day, the precursor organisation to One Billion Rising, helped me to set up a safe house for girls and young women who refused to be mutilated. I have run it for almost 20 years. When I began this work, some people reacted with fury. There were times when I was afraid for my safety. Not long ago, I got a call from a woman who told me of a young girl who wanted to resist cutting, but was being forced by her parents. By the time I arrived, she had been buried in a shallow grave after bleeding to death. I made sure the police investigated. Her father is now serving nine years in prison for manslaughter – but I know we need to do more. When women stand up and defend themselves, it works. According to the 2014 Kenya Demographic Health Survey, 21% of women continue to experience FGM – a huge drop over the past 50 years, but still far too many. No woman is free until all women are free.
