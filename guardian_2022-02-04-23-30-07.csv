2/4/2022,"The government has been forced to publish documents that reveal how the disgraced former Conservative MP Owen Paterson directly lobbied a senior minister for a healthcare firm that was paying him to be a consultant. Paterson contacted Matt Hancock, then health secretary, in the early stages of the Covid pandemic to promote Randox, a healthcare firm that paid him £100,000 a year.  Randox was awarded contracts worth nearly £500m during the pandemic without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for them. The new documents reveal that following Paterson’s lobbying, Hancock chased his officials, saying he was “very worried” about how his department was treating Randox and other firms. Paterson told Hancock that he was “exasperated” that the government was slow to respond to Randox’s offer to help deal with the pandemic. Amid regular contact between the two politicians via WhatsApp, Paterson also appeared, after an article in the Guardian, to ask Hancock to “kill once and for all” the suggestion that Randox had been awarded a contract because he was being paid by the firm. Hancock appeared to agree. Labour MPs used a parliamentary motion to compel the government to publish documents. The Department of Health and Social Care had resisted disclosing documents relating to Randox amid criticism of cronyism. Last November, Paterson resigned from the House of Commons after an official investigation found he had broken parliamentary rules when he lobbied for Randox and another firm. The investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner had been started after an investigation by the Guardian into Paterson’s lobbying activities. The documents were published by health secretary, Sajid Javid, who told parliament: “There are robust rules and processes in place to ensure that all contracts are awarded in line with procurement regulations and transparency guidelines … Ministers are not involved in the assessment and evaluation process for contracts.” They show how Paterson contacted Hancock on 26 January 2020 highlighting the services that Randox could offer to combat Covid. Hancock responds swiftly asking Randox for more information about potential Covid tests. On 25 February, as the pandemic began to take hold, Paterson complained to Hancock that it was “now 19 days since Public Health England (PHE) last contacted Randox at your request”. He added that kits to detect Covid were being shipped abroad, adding that “PHE’s attitude looks incomprehensible given current developments and time pressures”. Five minutes later, Hancock responded to Paterson, saying: “Are you sure? I chased them again about it yesterday.” Paterson complained that Randox had offered help to PHE, but added: “There was no sense of urgency … exasperating!” Hancock asked his officials for “chapter and verse” on how his department was dealing with commercial companies, adding: “I am very worried about this … if we are treating other companies like this we are failing.” On 1 March 2020, an official told Hancock that Randox was one of the firms whose technology had been prioritised for testing by the health department. Later that month, the Department of Health and Social Care awarded Randox a £133m contract to carry out Covid tests. It awarded the firm a second contract, worth £347m, in October 2020. Both contracts were given to the firm without other firms being given the opportunity to compete for them. The government suspended the normal rules on holding open competitions for public sector contracts under emergency powers designed to speed up the process during the pandemic. In October 2020, Paterson appeared to send Hancock a message saying the Guardian “yet again ran the story that you only gave Randox the testing contract because I am a paid consultant. If it comes up can you kill this once and for all I know absolutely nothing about the contract.” The answer, on WhatsApp, appeared to come back from Hancock: “of course”. Paterson declared in his communications with the government that he was paid by Randox. A Randox spokesperson said: “It is clear from these papers that Randox contracts were awarded in full compliance with government procedures and protocols in place at a time of the emerging pandemic.”",News/Politics,Owen Paterson’s Randox lobbying texts to Matt Hancock released,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/owen-patersons-randox-lobbying-texts-to-matt-hancock-released
2/4/2022,"Journalists working for Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp have had their email accounts hacked in what the company believes was an espionage operation linked to China, raising fears for the safety of confidential sources. The cyber-attack affected a limited number of individuals working for outlets including News UK – the publisher of the Times and the Sun – as well as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.  “Our preliminary analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that some data was taken,” said News Corp in an email to staff. The company said it was concerned for the wellbeing of its staff, its journalists and sources who have communicated with its reporters. An initial assessment by the cybersecurity company Mandiant, which was called in when News Corp discovered the apparent attack on 20 January, concluded that the attackers had links to China and “are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China’s interests”. News Corp said it was concerned about the protection of its staff and its journalists’ sources following the cyber-attack. “We are working closely with the leadership teams of the affected businesses to inform those employees whose accounts were impacted and help them take appropriate measures.” The email to staff described the attack as a “persistent nation-state attack” that had been contained. News Corp said it did not appear that any financial or user data had been targeted, suggesting the hackers may have been after information relating to its journalism. The company did not disclose how many email accounts were compromised by the Chinese-linked hackers, or what proportion of the compromised company email accounts belonged to its journalists. It does not believe staff at its other subsidiaries – such as the publisher HarperCollins or News Corp Australia – were targeted. Beijing has been accused repeatedly of running an aggressive hacking campaign designed to gather information from private companies and governments around the world. Earlier this week, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, used a speech to accuse the Chinese government of stealing “staggering volumes of information” using “a massive, sophisticated hacking programme that is bigger than those of every other major nation combined”, with well-funded operations based in every major Chinese city. News Corp said it would be informing other news publishers about the cyber-attack “We will not tolerate attacks on our journalism, nor will we be deterred from our reporting, which provides readers everywhere with the news that matters. “We believe it is important that other media organisations be made aware of this threat in order to take appropriate precautions, and we are providing technical details of the attack to the media information sharing and analysis organisation.”",News/Media,News Corp cyber-attack: firm says it believes hack linked to China,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/04/new-corp-hack-murdoch-media-firm-believes-hackers-links-china
2/4/2022,"The use of synthetic pesticides in parks and other green public spaces in urban areas is to be banned in the EU, with member states obliged to cut overall use by 50%, according to a leaked draft regulation. The move is said by the European Commission to be necessary owing to the failure of a number of EU member states to act on previous guidance on reducing the use of chemical pest control.  Officials say in the draft regulation that as a result of the proposals, “EU consumers could see increasing food prices, which might lead to increased imports from third countries with less strict regulation of pesticide use.” But officials have said they will examine ways to mitigate the impact, adding that the EU needs “to shift to a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system”. Under the regulation, pesticides would also be banned in nature protection areas. About 70 towns and cities in the UK are taking steps to reduce pesticide use, but there is not a prohibition in law. A spokesperson for the Pesticide Action Network UK (PAN UK) called on the British government to follow Brussels’ lead. He said: “PAN UK has been calling for such a measure for many years and to see the European Commission bringing forward plans to end the unnecessary use of pesticides in urban areas is very welcome. It will be a huge benefit for the citizens and environment of the EU. PAN UK would like to see the UK follow suit and end the use of pesticides in our towns and cities.” The draft EU regulation, which will need to win the support of member states and the European parliament, received a mixed reaction from environmental activists in mainland Europe. Concerns have been raised over the lack of strictures put on farmers to use methods such as crop rotation and mechanical weeding. Potential loopholes around the 50% target have also been identified, relating to lack of confidence in the collection of accurate data. Sarah Wiener, a Green MEP, said she feared the regulation would amount to empty promises. She said: “The commission’s proposal on the sustainable use of pesticides in the EU is anything but watertight. On the one hand, the commission acknowledges that the old directive gives the member states too much leeway and consequently wants to turn it into a regulation. On the other hand, the commission lists only insufficient measures to implement this basically good idea. “Not only that but the commission does not even want to make the basics of integrated pest management binding, which would be the absolute minimum to achieve lower pesticide use and protect human health and biodiversity.”",News/Environment,EU plans to ban use of synthetic pesticides in parks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/eu-plans-to-ban-use-of-synthetic-pesticides-in-parks
2/4/2022,"George Fouracres, best known as a comic, recently appeared on the Globe’s stage as Twelfth Night’s Andrew Aguecheek in a piece of exquisite casting. He returns as the avenging prince Hamlet, again under Sean Holmes’s direction, but this is not the Dane or the drama as we know it. It is Hamlet: The Comedy, or a “farcical-dramatical” as Polonius might say, with plenty of quizzical thrown in. Fouracres’s Hamlet is a modern-day Morrissey-singing indie-type stuck inside a period-dress court and speaks in a Black Country accent (Fouracres’ own). Sometimes he japes or raves, occasionally he verges on tears. That is all good and well, but Fouracres also flattens the poetry and rhythm in his character’s magnificent soliloquies, deliberately it seems, speaking them slowly, simplifying them so they sound almost like modern demotic. He also mines his character’s suicidal angst for laughs. This is entertaining – albeit strange, too – but sucks the tragedy out of the play.  Fouracres performs with an easy confidence but it seems like pastiche and his antic disposition is flip and wacky without carrying in its pretence a genuine anger and mental upset. The most profound moments – his soliloquies, his ruminations on Gertrude’s hasty marriage and his confrontation with her after Polonius’s death – feel deflated as a result. As an idea, there is great chutzpah in this production and some of it works: Irfan Shamji’s Claudius appears in stripes, like a court jester, and his giggling, giddy dance with Gertrude (Polly Frame, also convincing) in their first scene shows them to be irresponsible, amoral fun-lovers. Anna Watson’s gothic lighting throws big shadows across the walls and the play gradually turns darker after Polonius (well played by John Lightbody) is killed. Ed Gaughan’s score goes from breezy to creepy, with uneasy sounds plucked from an electric guitar. When the comedy momentarily ebbs and characters perform straight-faced, such as Claudius’s prayer scene and Hamlet’s sudden tears just before the dumb show, there are sparks of real tragedy which might have been powerful, if sustained. But it feels like confection because the things that make Hamlet a tragedy and give it emotional intensity are not there – or not for long enough – and we never get beyond the novelty value of the central “comic” idea, which hangs like an ill-fitting coat. The play’s existential depths are not plumbed and neither do we buy into the pain and passion of Hamlet’s romance with Ophelia (Rachel Hannah Clarke). There is no chemistry between them, and when she unravels she appears in modern dress and encourages a sing-along moment in the auditorium. It is an amusing twist, but her character lacks a unified vision. A gender-swapped Laertes (Nadi Kemp-Sayfi) is underpowered in grief and does not bring enough tension to the final duel. The ghost of Hamlet’s father (Ciarán O’Brien) seems like an evil creature when he appears in Gertrude’s bedroom, almost drowning young Hamlet in the set’s small, central pool (nifty design by Grace Smart), which does not cohere with the ghost as a force of moral rectitude in this rotten court. Maybe what is needed with a vision as left-field as this is tautness, but the pace is baggy, the laughs lukewarm and the drama drags. Just when we think we have made it to the gravedigger scene, Gaughan delivers a prolonged skit in which he unpicks its meanings. The production begins to show its intention to reach a younger audience here, explaining the joke about Hamlet’s banishment to England (“The subtext of this bit is that all English people are mad” says Gaughan). Is this, then, a Hamlet desperate to appeal to young audiences? It is certainly a fittingly counterintuitive follow-up to the Globe’s anti-romance Romeo and Juliet, directed last year by Ola Ince. Maybe some will celebrate its fun and daring and there is entertainment in it. But it seems too confusing a melange of comedy and gothic horror with other Shakespearean cross-references thrown in (Romeo and Juliet’s balcony scene and a fleeting impersonation of Richard III). It never quite arrives at tragedy and is, in the end, hoist with its own petard.

2/4/2022,"Boris Johnson gathered his rapidly diminishing No 10 team in the cabinet room on Friday morning and invoked the spirit of the Lion King film, telling them “change is good”. After five senior departures from Downing Street in the past 24 hours alone, including that of his longstanding policy chief Munira Mirza, Johnson’s official spokesman said he had sought to reassure colleagues.  “He reflected on the privilege of working in No 10, in order to deliver for the British people, and reiterated his and No 10’s commitment to serving the public by keeping people safe, improving lives and spreading opportunity,” the spokesman said. “The prime minister acknowledges that this is a challenging time as we go through a period of change. But as he reiterated to the whole team today, there’s an important job to do,” he added. The spokesman confirmed that Johnson had said “change is good”, telling aides he was quoting from the Lion King. Mirza quit dramatically on Thursday, citing Johnson’s attempt to smear Keir Starmer over the failure to prosecute the paedophile Jimmy Savile, for which the prime minister has refused to apologise. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, distanced himself from Johnson for those comments, saying: “I wouldn’t have said it.” Three more resignations were announced later on Thursday, in what was widely seen as an attempt to seize back control of the narrative. But another adviser, Elena Narozanski, then resigned from the No 10 policy unit on Friday morning. Johnson’s spokesman said the three men whose departures were announced on Thursday evening – the communications director, Jack Doyle, the principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, and the PM’s chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield – would stay on for a short period while their successors are recruited. Reynolds is a civil servant, who is expected to return to his former department of the Foreign Office. The spokesman said recruitment for his post, a powerful role whose holder acts as a gatekeeper to the prime minister, would begin immediately. Johnson had been promising MPs a drastic overhaul of his Downing Street operation since Sue Gray’s report into lockdown parties identified “failures of leadership and judgment”. He told MPs on Monday after the report was published: “I get it and I will fix it.” The prime minister moved quickly on Thursday to appoint Andrew Griffith, who had previously acted as his liaison with Tory MPs, to a ministerial post as the new head of the No 10 policy unit, succeeding Mirza. Johnson’s spokesman said further announcements on a new structure inside No 10 and who would take over from departing staff members, would be made in the coming days. The prime minister has been fighting for his political life since the Metropolitan police announced they would be investigating a string of lockdown gatherings. Tory whips are braced for more potential departures, with the solicitor general, Alex Chalk, reported to be on “resignation watch”. However, while Chalk did raise concerns about the Savile comments during a meeting with Johnson, it is understood he did not threaten to resign. Thursday’s exodus from Downing Street came on a day when No 10 had hoped the headlines would be dominated by Sunak’s measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis – the latest in a packed relaunch week that saw Johnson fly to Ukraine, and the publication of a long-awaited levelling-up white paper.",News/Politics,‘Change is good’: Johnson quotes the Lion King as he tries to rally No 10 staff,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-quotes-lion-king-rally-no-10-staff-change-good
2/4/2022,"Concacaf has expressed its “extreme surprise and concern” that the St Kitts and Nevis Football Association (SKNFA) has again claimed it consulted them over the appointment of a coach accused of sexually abusing and harassing female players in Barbados. Ahmed Mohamed was the subject of an investigation in Barbados after 27 players from the senior women’s team signed a letter at the start of that month urging the Barbados Football Association to investigate claims made by one of their teammates. It understood that the player alleged the coach raped her at a hotel when she was 18 and that she previously received a series of unwelcome text messages from him. Mohamed has not responded to questions from the Guardian.  Atiba Harris, the president of the SKNFA, has said that Mohamed stepped down as technical director of the BFA last year for “family reasons” and was chosen as the new director of football after Harris “reached out personally” to the BFA president, Randy Harris, who is the president of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) and a vice-president of Concacaf and “also other officials within Concacaf and Fifa”. However, a Concacaf spokesperson told the Guardian that “at no point has anyone from the St Kitts and Nevis FA contacted the Concacaf administration to seek information regarding this individual”. Fifa said it would be contacting the SKNFA to request more details. Techell McLean, the general secretary of the SNKFA, sent a letter to its member clubs on Thursday reiterating it had “conducted a serious and fulsome due diligence exercise involving consultations with members of the Barbados Football Association, Concacaf and other persons who knew Mr Mohamed personally”. “The SKNFA was and remains fully satisfied that Mr Mohamed is a good character - the allegations made against him being false,” he added. “And he has the requisite technical ability to perform his functions ad take SKNFA football to higher levels.” But in a letter that has been seen by the Guardian, Philippe Maggio, Concacaf’s general secretary, directly responded to McLean. “With extreme surprise and concern, we have noticed that the St Kitts Football Federation, through various mediums, has affirmed that Concacaf was consulted in relation to the hiring process of Mr Ahmed Mohamed as technical director of the SKNFA,” it reads. “In this respect, we want to unequivocally reaffirm and stress as we have done in recent days that no one in the Concacaf administration was or has been consulted in relation to the engagement of Mr Mohamed with the SKNFA. Concacaf takes the allegations against Mr Mohamed extremely seriously and have duly noted that Fifa will look into the matter.” It is understood that clubs in Barbados will discuss whether to call in an independent investigator at a meeting on Friday, with several having privately expressed concerns over the BFA’s handling of the case and its leadership. Randy Harris, who was re-elected unopposed as president of the CFU last year, said he would look into the case on his return to Barbados. “I don’t know of these things that I am hearing about pertaining to the BFA,” he told Barbados Today. “So, I would have to deal with it on my return and see if I could find out if any of these issues are true because they are very serious and no report has been made to the BFA about them.” Asked last week whether he would like to comment about the claim he recommended Mohamed, Randy Harris replied: “No sir.” Mohamed is understood to be in Anguilla with the St Kitts women’s team, who beat their hosts 3-0 in a friendly on Thursday.",Sport/Football,Concacaf and St Kitts FA at loggerheads over coach accused of sexual abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/concacaf-and-st-kitts-fa-at-loggerheads-over-coach-accused-of-sexual-abuse
2/4/2022,"Someone on Twitter recently asked if it was it appropriate to use the term “new world” in relation to wine. Over the past couple of decades, it’s been a useful, if lazy, shorthand for the mainly southern hemisphere countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Chile and South Africa that provide much of our more affordable drinking, but I don’t think most people who use the term see it as derogatory, or would want to imply that new is inferior to old. It’s more a way of telling consumers what to expect from a wine. By “new world”, they’re essentially talking about the modern wine industry, rather than those countries and regions where things are done in much the same way as they always have been, as well as wines that are generally fruitier, more full-bodied and have higher ABVs than traditional old-world wines. But the term’s critics do have a point: at the end of the day, it doesn’t bear a whole lot of scrutiny.  For a start, most of these so-called “new-world” countries also have old vines, as well as winemaking traditions that go back at least 100 years (New Zealand’s achievement, however, is all the more remarkable, because it doesn’t). Australia’s grenache and shiraz, South Africa’s chenin blanc (which used to be known as steen) and pinotage, Chile’s carignan and pais, which was introduced by Spanish missionaries in the 16th century, still produce remarkable and distinctive wines. (South Africa’s Old Vine Project, for example, has done a great job of highlighting the value of that country’s older vineyards.) Tastes have also changed, so you now find some “old-world” producers making wines in a bolder, more “fruit-forward” (that’s winespeak for “fruity”) style, while many “new-world” producers are embracing more traditional methods such as the use of amphoras, natural yeasts and foot treading, while the natural wine movement is almost as popular in the new world as it is in the old. Even regions as traditional as Bordeaux and Rioja will have exponents of different styles. In Rioja, for example, you can find bodegas making classic, oaky gran reservas and other producers, such as Roda, who use names rather than classifications for their top cuvées. This can cause tensions with producers who feel that the regulatory bodies are too restrictive and no longer represent the way they want to make wine. So much so, in some cases, that famous appellations such as Saint-Émilion and Cava have seen member producers split away, most recently Château Angélus from Saint-Émilion. So how can you tell who is in the “old” camp and who’s “new”? Ask your local wine merchant. Look at the imagery and description on the label. Or just buy it, try it and make up your own mind.

2/4/2022,"I have a relationship problem and I feel stuck. I met my partner two years ago via online dating. Since then he has rebuffed all my attempts to meet any of his friends or family members. One time, we ran into a family friend, and he instructed me to hide behind something so I would not be seen with him. I’ve also had to leave his house on more than one occasion because one of his family members was in the neighbourhood. He is unimaginably cruel to me about my appearance, but I can’t bring myself to leave. I do not know how this relationship serves me, but I’m getting older and I’m too scared of what will happen.  Recently, I found out that he’s been going on dates with another woman and confiding in her about how much grief I give him. I asked him about this, but he denies any wrongdoing. I’m not bound to this man by anything, it seems. We have no children, and he refuses to talk about the future. The fact that I have stuck around for two years may be linked to my difficult childhood and my self-esteem issues. Please help me with some words of encouragement. I need a gentle jolt in the right direction. What a horrible situation you find yourself in. Sometimes, we’ve become so used to the way things are, we need to tell others what is happening so we can see it for what it is. I would have liked for you to expand when you said, “I’m too scared of what will happen.” I wasn’t sure if you meant you feared for your safety if you left (if so please have a look at the Refuge site), or if you were afraid of being alone. Someone being “unimaginably cruel” about your appearance is someone being abusive. It is done to erode your self-esteem, and he’s succeeding. It’s easy for people to tell you to leave but if it were that easy you would have done it. You say you’re not bound to this man by anything, and it sounds as if you don’t live together. These are massive positives. What support do you have? Family? Friends? Who or what makes you feel good? Spend more time with these people. Do you want to be here, with him, in a year, in five years’ time? If someone you love was being treated like this, how would you feel? What would you tell them? Something compelled you to write in for help, which suggests you know you are worthy of more. But you have another, critical voice that keeps you where you are. Whose is this voice? It sounds like your childhood and self-esteem issues may need exploring with a trusted friend, if not a therapist. A little, personal story. When I was much younger I had a boyfriend who didn’t treat me well. Every day I promised myself I’d end it, but every day I didn’t. He went away on holiday, without me, and asked if he could take my stereo with him. I loved my stereo. I’d saved up for it and bought it when I was 16. It had been everywhere with me. I lent it to him and when he came back he didn’t have it. He made up some stupid excuse, but he had either lost it or sold it for drugs. Incredible and silly though this sounds, what he had done to my stereo angered me so much I found my courage to leave. It isn’t easy but staying with him will be harder in the long run. Please get support and treat yourself as someone you love – someone who deserves to be shown off, not asked to hide.

2/4/2022,"Once upon a time, the Brit awards and the Grammys were an annual staple in the TV calendar of even the most casual music fan. Drawing millions of viewers, the ceremonies offered a feast of entertainment, ranging from the unpredictable to the spectacular. Think Chumbawamba chucking a bucket of ice water over John Prescott at the 1998 Brits or Lady Gaga emerging from an egg at the Grammys in 2011. More recently, Brits sets by Stormzy and Dave have marked an important shift in mainstream recognition of Black British talent. For audiences, however, the shine seems to have worn off. Last year’s ITV broadcast of the Brits, which was postponed from February to May due to Covid-19, recorded 2.9 million viewers – a figure that plunged for the fourth year running. The 2021 Grammys were the lowest rated in history, delivering an audience of just 8.8 million viewers for CBS, down a staggering 53% on the year prior. (These declines aren’t exclusive to music award ceremonies: the Oscars also recorded a 58.3% dip in viewers last year.)  This is not the whole picture: both events have made efforts to digitise their offerings and could boast high engagement on social media. The 2021 Brits had a global audience of 1.7 million for its YouTube live stream, while the Grammys toutedsaw more than 77bn impressions on social platforms that same year. But beyond the numbers, there have been other challenges. In 2016, the #BritsSoWhite campaign shone a light on a lack of racial diversity. That year, there were just four artists/groups of colour (Naughty Boy, Rudimental, Izzy Bizu and Arrow Benjamin as a featured singer) nominated in the British categories, from a total of 52 entries, and all the winners were white. Gender has also been an issue: from 2011 to 2021, female acts represented only 31.5% of nominees in the four main categories, and last year, Little Mix were the first girl band to win best British group in the Brits’ 41-year history. The Grammys too has been accused of racial bias – both Drake and Frank Ocean snubbed the 2017 show for that reason – and, in 2020, the first female president and CEO of its parent organisation, the Recording Academy, Deborah Dugan, exited after less than six months, calling the event “ripe with corruption”. More recently, the Weeknd has said he’ll snub the Grammys due to a lack of transparency in the voting after he received no nominations. While that might seem like sour grapes, he isn’t alone: Drake, who has withdrawn his two nominations for 2022, last year called for the ceremony to be replaced with something new. For all the criticism, both the Brits and Grammys are at least showing a willingness to innovate. The Grammys responded to inequality claims by setting up a diversity and inclusion task force, with the Recording Academy publishing the steps being taken to address the “systemic and ongoing under-representation” of minority groups. The Brits voting academy, meanwhile, is refreshed each year and in 2020, the male/female split of voters was 51%/49%, with BAME representation at 24.5%. This year, the Brits’ gendered categories have been scrapped to make room for non-binary artists (after Sam Smith said they weren’t eligible for inclusion in 2021). Still, these attempts at a refresh have brought their own problems. The lack of a specific category for female talent poses the risk of fewer women being celebrated. We know this is what happens on other platforms: on UK radio, female acts took a minuscule 20% share of airplay in the first six months of 2021, according to figures from the Why Not Her? collective. The founder of Why Not Her?, Linda Coogan Byrne, says: “If you have gender-neutral awards categories, what you get reflected back at you is the discrimination that exists in the music industry. The people on those judging panels can only choose whoever has been nominated. Who submits the work? It’s predominantly the record labels. And if only 20% of those they sign are female-identifying artists, how many women are going to win?” Perhaps the biggest challenge facing both sets of awards is maintaining relevance. It is hard to capture the attention of today’s youth when they can spend time on pretty much whatever they want – be it Lil Nas X’s pole-dancing descent into hell or a video of a cat laughing – by just picking up their phones. And, crucially, that generation has grown up on streaming, where the focus is more on songs. Awards shows have struggled to get their heads round this new digital world. Subscription streaming, while accounting for 79% of consumer spend on music in 2021, doesn’t really pay well unless an artist is in a rarefied tier of megastars. That means that using sales as a barometer of success – as the Brits, where entries are only eligible if they reach the Top 40, does – isn’t particularly representative of the world musicians live in today, either. Acts who have a lucrative touring life, or are popular in a myriad of other ways, are bypassed. It is striking that Little Simz is a Brits best new artist nominee this year because she scored her first Top 40 album, despite the fact it’s her fourth overall, and she has been independently successful for many years. Still, aside from the changes both ceremonies have already made, and will surely make in future, the idea of them being replaced by “something new” seems unlikely, given that the events are organised and owned by the music industry. “They are an advert for what the respective industries have managed to create over the past 12 months. Also, winning an award and getting up on stage at the ceremony suggests you are pretty wonderful and that’s quite a good feel for artists,” says Ted Cockle, the president of publisher Hipgnosis Songs, who sits on the Brits Committee. What’s more likely is that both events chug on, chopped into ever-shorter clips, while TV viewership continues to dwindle until the format becomes obsolete. The magic of those unpredictable moments that happened in less polished times may be lost but, hey, at least there’s an endless number of funny animal videos to watch.

2/4/2022,"The carbon dioxide emissions of new cars sold in the UK dropped to the lowest level ever in 2021 thanks to the unprecedented surge in electric vehicle sales, industry data suggests. Average new car CO2 emissions fell by 11.2%, to 119.7g for every kilometre driven, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group.  Battery electric vehicles accounted for only 12% of UK sales during 2021, but they rapidly drag down the figures because they produce zero exhaust emissions. Increased sales of hybrids, which include a battery alongside an internal combustion engine, also contributed to the fall in emissions, which was previously stymied in recent years by the rise of sales in higher-emission sports utility vehicles (SUVs). In 2021, the SMMT reported a 38% drop in average new car emissions since 2000, although those data were produced under a different test methodology so are not directly comparable. Car sales data for January, also published on Friday, showed that the number of battery electric cars more than doubled year on year to 14,400, accounting for 12.5% of cars sold. Total new car sales rose by 27.5% year on year in January, although that was compared with January 2021 when the UK was in a strict lockdown and car showrooms were closed. The industry reported that sales were still limited by the months-long shortage of computer chips that has forced carmakers to favour key vehicles, including electric cars – which are vital for meeting emissions legislation. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “Once again it is electrified vehicles that are driving the growth, despite the ongoing headwinds of chip shortages, rising inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze. “[This year] is off to a reasonable start, however, and with around 50 new electrified models due for release this year, customers will have an ever greater choice, which can only be good for our shared environmental ambitions.” Sales of electric cars are expected to rise further during 2022, but it will probably still be several years before electric cars make a serious dent in total UK transport emissions. SMMT data published in May showed that battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids made up only 1.3% of the 40.35m cars on UK roads. In 2019, road transport accounted for 25% of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions, according to government data. Ben Nelmes, the head of policy and research at the thinktank New AutoMotive, said: “Electric car sales have doubled in the last year, but there is still a mountain to climb to reduce the UK’s carbon emissions from cars. The 90,000 internal combustion engines that rolled off forecourts this month will continue to pollute and hit motorists in their pockets for another 14 years, on average.” The SMMT said that sales of electric cars are still limited by the perceived lack of charge points. Government data showed there were 28,400 public charge points available across the UK on 1 January, but the lobby group has previously said the country may need four or five times that amount. The emissions data came as MPs on the transport select committee said that the move to electric cars meant the government should urgently work on plans for road pricing, under which drivers would pay by the mile. The government rakes in about £28bn a year in fuel duty paid on petrol and diesel, a tax that does not affect electric car drivers. There is “no viable alternative” to road pricing to fill the gap in the budget, the MPs wrote in their report.",News/Business,Electric vehicles bring down CO2 emissions of new cars in UK to lowest level ever,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/electric-vehicles-bring-down-co2-emissions-of-new-cars-in-uk-to-lowest-level-ever
2/4/2022,"Tube workers are to go on strike for two days next month over fears for jobs, pensions and working conditions, threatening widespread disruption across London. The RMT union announced that its members on the tube would walk out on 1 and 3 March.  The union said it had had no assurances as Transport for London continues to look for ways to balance its finances after passenger numbers and revenue fell drastically during the pandemic, with central government refusing to confirm emergency funding will continue. A ballot of more than 10,000 members resulted in 94% backing industrial action, although TfL said only about 50% of staff had voted. Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretary, said: “Our members will be taking strike action next month because a financial crisis at London Underground (LUL) has been deliberately engineered by the government to drive a cuts agenda, which would savage jobs, services, safety and threaten their working conditions and‎ pensions. “These are the very same transport staff praised as heroes for carrying London through Covid for nearly two years. Staff will not pay the price for this cynically engineered crisis.” TfL said it would be open to talks and urged the RMT to “do the right thing for London and call off this unnecessary action”. Andy Lord said the strike call was “extremely disappointing”. TfL’s chief operating officer said no proposals had been tabled on pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody would lose their jobs. He said: “The devastating impact of the pandemic on TfL finances has made a programme of change urgently necessary and we need the RMT to work with us, rather than disrupting London’s recovery.” TfL has commissioned an independent review of staff pension arrangements, as a condition of the funding released by central government last year. It has also said it will not fill about 250 vacant customer service posts nor replace about 250-350 more when staff leave or retire, cutting the overall numbers by about 10%-12%. Meanwhile, the TSSA union said it would act if Network Rail attempted to make staff compulsorily redundant on the national railway. Network Rail is planning to cut more than 900 further jobs, which the union said were “predominantly professional and technical staff who ensure the safe running of our railways”. Manuel Cortes, the TSSA leader, said: “Tory cuts are bulldozing our rail industry. Their so-called levelling-up is a fallacy. Sadly, the message for passengers is you are paying more for less.”",News/UK news,"Tube workers to strike over jobs, pensions and working conditions",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/tube-workers-strike-march-jobs-pensions-working-conditions-rmt
2/4/2022,"If the government were a company, the shareholders would have thrown out the chairman and board of directors by now. If it were a school, Ofsted inspectors would have judged it inadequate and put it into special measures. If there had potentially been lawbreaking, the police would have been involved a lot sooner. But the government knows it is bigger than any such institution, and consequently thinks it can’t be moved. Its behaviour over the past few weeks has chillingly echoed the pattern adopted by many organisations accused of something horrendous, which is to double down, evade, attack accusers, hide behind investigations, and ultimately use the shield of an apology to say – as Mark Zuckerberg has been saying for half his life – that clearly we didn’t get everything right, and we must now look to a future where such things never happen again.  Look at the examples of churches hiding abusive priests, banks involved in money laundering, racist cricket clubs, national broadcasters disciplining a duplicitous reporter, a political party investigating antisemitism, specialist care homes looking into complaints of assault, police departments investigating failings within their ranks or schools protecting an abusive teacher. They all consistently adopt a classic and rotten playbook now being used with some commitment by the prime minister and his cabinet. After stern denials comes manufactured outrage, for example, in the wake of the Allegra Stratton video: “I was also furious to see that clip”. Then comes a firm commitment to investigate, “to establish the facts and report back as soon as possible”. At this early stage, the organisation’s instincts is to police itself, so keeping any findings away from the public sphere. Unfortunately, in this instance Simon Case, whom Boris Johnson had only recently appointed to his job as cabinet secretary, had to recuse himself since he appeared to have held a gathering in his own office. No worries. There are other blunter but heftier weapons in the backpack. Sue Gray may be more formidable, but in a neat jiujitsu move, you can use that to your advantage. “Look, we’ve asked no less ferocious an investigator than Sue Gray to examine this, so that shows how transparent we’re being.” Since everything’s above board ( with someone who wasn’t your first choice), this gives you the chance to question the motives of those who persist in challenging you and the opportunity to belittle them. It’s a thread that connects failing schools or special care units that vilify complaining families, Labour party members who call out antisemitism being attacked as disgruntled opponents, a graphic designer being sidelined by the BBC after raising concerns about Martin Bashir, or Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers questioning the sanity of those who accused her. With “partygate”, the same playbook has been used, taking in attacks on the media for wanting to engage in tittle-tattle, Jacob Rees-Mogg denouncing the Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, as “a lightweight figure” and the sinister decision by Johnson himself to drag a rightwing online conspiracy theory about Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile into the broad daylight of mainstream news. With gaslighting in full throttle, a parallel manoeuvre is also under way: to hide behind legal technicalities wherever possible. These can often involve absurd twists of logic, as when, for example, Prince Andrew’s lawyers tried to argue he couldn’t be sued since he was protected by an agreement the complainant had made with a dead paedophile. There was a degree of absurdity on Tuesday when the disinformation minister, Chris Philp, before a parliamentary committee scrutinising his online safety bill, refused to distance himself from the online disinformation about Starmer – the kind that his bill is intended to root out. It’s a position that has also been taken publicly this week by our ministers for culture and justice. But that’s how the rot spreads. If a sociopath is at the heart of an organisation, then the organisation itself begins to take on the characteristics of the person controlling it. Each one close to him or her becomes infected, because it’s now too late to do anything else. The best they can do now is delay; say they’d love to tell you everything, but their hands are tied. They rely on the fact that we’ve all got lives to be getting on with, we can’t keep paying lawyers, and some of us have died, while others are just tired. A government is different, though: its adversaries are, potentially, all of us. It may be that there are just too many of us following the smell of something rotten for this to end cleanly for them.

2/4/2022,"The UK film and TV industry has bounced back spectacularly from the pandemic with a record £5.6bn spent making blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible 7 and big-budget dramas including Bridgerton in the UK last year. It was double the level of investment in 2020, when the spread of coronavirus shut down the production industry for months on end.  The production industry moved into overdrive last year as broadcasters, streaming platforms and Hollywood studios worked to replenish their depleted content libraries for the small and big screen, with spending up almost £1.3bn on the previous record set in pre-pandemic 2019. “The demand for content has never been greater,” said Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the British Film Commission. “The UK is enjoying a once in a generation growth in production.” The annual figures compiled by the British Film Institute highlight the battle for viewers being waged between streaming companies such as Netflix and Disney, and traditional broadcasters such as Sky, the BBC and ITV. A record £4.1bn was spent making 211 high-end TV shows costing at least £1m an episode, such as new series of Bridgerton, The Crown and The Bay, almost three-quarters of the total spent on all film and TV production last year. The figure includes £737m spent on films made specifically for release on streaming platforms, such as Pinocchio, which the BFI classifies as TV spend. The overall amount spent on making premium shows last year is almost £2bn up on 2019. More than 200 films were shot in the UK last year with £1.55bn spent on production, up 13% on 2020 but down on the £1.95bn in 2019. However, just nine Hollywood blockbusters, including The Batman, Aquaman 2 and The Marvels, accounted for £1bn of that spend. “The record-breaking level of film and TV production in the UK revealed today is good news for our industry and the UK economy and demonstrates the speed of the sector’s recovery,” said Ben Roberts, the chief executive of the BFI.",Arts/Film,UK film and TV industry bounces back from Covid with record £5.6bn spend,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/uk-film-and-tv-industry-bounces-back-from-covid-with-record-spend
2/4/2022,"The US economy appeared to shake off the Omicron variant in January as employers added 467,000 new jobs, the labor department reported on Friday. Data for the report was collected in mid-January when the Omicron variant was at its peak in the US and while some economists – and the White House – had predicted a dramatic slump in jobs growth, the number of jobs added was far better than expected.  The unemployment rate remained low overall at 4%, down from a pandemic high of 14.8% in April 2020 but up from 3.9% in December. The news comes at a sensitive time for the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve. The US economy is wrestling with soaring inflation and signs of an economic slowdown after last year’s strong rebound. Earlier this week, in a highly unusual move, the White House sought to manage expectations ahead of the latest jobs figure release. White House officials cautioned that Friday’s jobs report could be “confusing” because of the timing of the survey. Covid infections have fallen sharply across the US since the report was compiled. The government report follows on from a survey conducted by ADP, the US’s largest private payroll supplier, which reported that companies cut jobs in January for the first time in over a year. Payrolls fell by 301,000 for the month with more than half the losses coming from the pandemic-sensitive leisure and hospitality industries. “The labor market recovery took a step back at the start of 2022 due to the effect of the Omicron variant and its significant, though likely temporary, impact to job growth,” said Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist. There were signs that the jobs market is still recovering ahead of Friday’s report. On Thursday, the labor department reported that new unemployment claims fell to 238,000 for the final week in January, dropping 23,000 from the week prior, a second straight week of falls.",News/Business,US appears to shake off Omicron and adds nearly half a million January jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/us-jobs-figures-january-omicron-covid
2/4/2022,"The first thing Martin Glass thought about was his daughter, when he heard the news on Monday evening that his home town team, Raith Rovers, were signing a man ruled to be a rapist by a civil court. Lillie is just seven and a half months old but 26-year-old Glass is a first-time dad and he’s already looking forward to taking her to her first game. “I want my daughter to have good role models. If I’m part of a club that has a rapist as an idol then that’s on me.”  His second thought was to set up a fundraising page for Rape Crisis Scotland. “Let’s make a difference,” he wrote, introducing the online appeal. By Friday morning, he had raised more than £12,000. “I needed to show Raith and football fans in general did not support this,” Glass said. “It’s a small bit of good out of the darkest moment in our club’s history.” Raith Rovers’ decision to sign David Goodwillie, who was ordered to pay damages to the woman he was found to have raped in a landmark case in 2017, resulted in a ferocious backlash that escalated as the week progressed, with sponsorship withdrawals, multiple resignations and the women’s team moving to sever ties. On Thursday, the Scottish Championship club announced in a contrite statement that it had “got it wrong”, would not select Goodwillie and was reviewing the 32-year-old striker’s contract. But Glass echoes many Raith supporters whose response to the U-turn has been only a qualified welcome. “If this is all that happens, I won’t be back this season. The board should resign: they came up with this, they should take the consequences rather than the fans, volunteers and players.” Aileen Campbell, the chief executive of Scottish Women’s Football, agreed that the statement on Thursday was “only the first step” in rebuilding trust with supporters. While questions have been raised about why there was not a similar reaction when Goodwillie returned to Scotland to play for Clyde in 2017, Campbell said this week’s outcry marked a shift in expectations in recent years. “It shows that society has moved on and we don’t want this to be part of our game.” As head of the governing body for women’s association football in Scotland and a former Scottish government sports minister, Campbell’s priority this week has been offering support to the women’s team, describing the impact on the players and ensuing spotlight as “overwhelming”. It is ironic, she adds, that the women’s team was forced to seek alternative sponsorship and a new ground at which to play, at a time of growing momentum for the women’s sport. “We’re at a really important juncture in the game with the visibility of women’s football increasing, as well as generating that critical financial support and sponsorship. There is lots of scope for it to grow and we have inspiring role models, women who have often defied the odds in combining work and family.” Eve Ralph, a football coach at Leicester City and co-founder of Her Game Too, a campaign set up by 12 female fans last summer with the aim of ending sexism in football, believes the conversation among football supporters is changing too. “Football culture across the UK has come a long way, with more women going to matches and men more likely to call it out if their friend says something unacceptable. There’s more discussion about what’s acceptable behaviour and what’s not”. High-profile arrests for alleged sexual violence, including of the Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood on Sunday, have raised questions about how Premier League clubs handle such allegations. “There’s still a sense that a lot of players are not facing the consequences for their actions,” says Ralph. A Bristol City fan, she mentions how Women’s Aid ended its partnership with the club last year after it signed Danny Simpson, a player with a domestic abuse conviction. “Footballers are huge role models for men and women, and the attitude of ‘he’s got a past but he’s a great player’ has a terrible effect on anyone who may think ‘I can get away with it if I’m famous’.” Some younger Raith fans have pointed out that one of the only sections of supporters supporting Goodwillie are some of the teenage boys who make up Raith’s youth fanbase. One young woman told the Guardian: “They’re the ones on Instagram saying it’s really unfair. To them he’s just some guy who got away with a threesome.” “Some people will say Goodwillie deserves a second chance,” says the SNP MP Hannah Bardell, who spent four years working at Livingston FC before she became a politician. “But there have to be boundaries around certain crimes, and yet again this is putting men’s careers over women’s lives.” Bardell contrasts Goodwillie’s lack of public contrition – which she accepts may be legally advised – with that of David Martindale, who was made Livingston manager last year amid some controversy, having spent time in prison for drug dealing. “These are complex questions and we need to have a framework that enables us to make these fine judgments. Rehabilitation is a cornerstone of any civilised society. “Nobody’s saying Goodwillie shouldn’t be able to live his life, but being a footballer at that level, being a role model, is difficult.” This is part of a broader discussion, she says, about the pedestal footballers are put on, how much they are paid, and the culture surrounding them. After withdrawing her shirt sponsorship from the men’s team on Tuesday, the crime writer and devoted Raith fan Val McDermid stepped in to pay for new strips for the women’s team, without the club crest. This Sunday, Bardell will head to Windmill Park, Kirkcaldy, to watch the recently renamed McDermid Ladies play at 2pm. The women’s team are expecting a big crowd.",Sport/Football,‘Darkest moment in our history’: Raith fans on David Goodwillie row,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/darkest-moment-in-our-history-raith-rovers-fans-david-goodwillie-row
2/4/2022,"The US is testing robotic patrol dogs along its frontier with Mexico that it says could provide “mechanical reinforcements” for border guards, in a move criticised by a leading domestic rights group as a “civil liberties disaster”. Adding to the outcry, the company that developed the dogs, Ghost Robotics, has previously showcased a four-legged robot that has a sniper rifle attached to its back.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said this week that its research and development arm had offered border guards “a helping hand (or ‘paw’)” to work to “force-multiply” patrols. “Due to the demands of the region, adding quadruped mechanical reinforcements is a smart use of resources,” the DHS said in a blog post. Gavin Kenneally, the chief operating officer at Ghost Robotics, said the unarmed 45kg robot dog was “bred” to walk on sand, rocks and hills, as well as human-built environments such as stairs. The robots were tested in El Paso, Texas, which straddles the international border. “In a desert area, the dogs were programmed to go on simulated sentry duty,” DHS said. It suggested that the bulky metal robots could even be used “as cover” for border guards. “Just like anywhere else, you have your standard criminal behaviour, but along the border you can also have human smuggling, drug smuggling, as well as smuggling of other contraband – including firearms or even potentially, [weapons of mass destruction],” agent Brett Becker, of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) innovation team, was quoted as saying. Federal agents operating along the Mexican border have long been accused of misconduct and mistreatment of the migrants and asylum seekers attempting to enter the US. Joe Biden’s administration has been sharply criticised by refugee advocates for the growing number of immigrants being held at private facilities. The American Civil Liberties Union warned on Thursday that Washington’s plan to use robot patrol dogs on its borders was “a civil liberties disaster in the making”. “The government must retract this dangerous proposal, and the Biden administration must put the brakes on our country’s slide into an anti-immigrant dystopia,” the advocacy group said. In its post, DHS said people should not be “surprised if in the future we see robot ‘Fido’ out in the field, walking side-by-side with [CBP] personnel”.",News/US news,US tests of robotic patrol dogs on Mexican border prompt outcry,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/04/us-tests-of-robotic-patrol-dogs-on-mexican-border-prompt-outcry

From 28 February, the retailer, which has outlets in Manchester, Birmingham and London, will offer the headline-grabbing services as part of its Superself event, which it claims “takes visitors on a journey of uplifting self-discovery and nurturing self-care”.  The therapy sessions are being provided in partnership with The Stack World, a women-focused online media outlet that was spun out of the Beautystack beauty marketplace founded by the former stylist Sharmadean Reid. The 45-minute £150 “sex life reboot” is being led by Dr Karen Gurney, a clinical psychologist and psycho-sexologist who promises “to evaluate and reset a couple’s or an individual’s sex life through a Sex Life MOT”. Other options include a £50 confidence coaching session or £99 “creative breakthrough” meeting with a hypnotherapist. The “psychedelic trips” are provided via hi-tech pods operated by technology specialist Sensiks, where users are bombarded with “bespoke fragrances, infrared light, heat and sound”. The colourful constructions, which resemble giant seed pods, use virtual reality technology to help users “drift through” a “calming universe” of kaleidoscopic forms and relaxing music. Selfridges claims the experience is “much like a short meditation”. Superself is the latest in a long line of Selfridges events, with themes ranging from literature to the environment, that have aimed to tempt shoppers into stores in the digital age. This year is particularly tricky as city centres, and especially London where Selfridges has its flagship store, have been hard hit after the pandemic prompted a shift to working from home and decimated tourist travel.

However, it has delayed its regeneration plans after they got off to a disastrous start with the £6m Marble Arch Mound, which drew ridicule.

2/4/2022,"Households can expect their water bills to rise to an average of almost £420 a year from April, compounding a record rise in energy costs and an increase in national insurance contributions that are due in the same month. Bills will rise by 1.7% in England and Wales from April, according to the industry body Water UK, pushing up the typical annual bill by roughly £7 to £419 a year.  The increase will come as further unwelcome news to hard-pressed households after Thursday’s announcement of the imminent £693 increase in home energy bills, which will drive the cost of gas and electricity to an average of £1,977 a year and plunge millions of homes into fuel poverty. Christine McGourty, the chief executive of Water UK, said customers would pay “little more than £1 a day for their water and sewerage service” and there was “a wide range of support available for those in need”. “But we know this is a difficult time for many, and no one should have to worry about their household essentials,” she added. Jess Cook, who leads the water poverty programme for National Energy Action, a fuel poverty charity, said research had shown that more than 40% of those struggling to pay their water bills would bathe less to reduce their water bills. Almost a quarter would cut back on food or personal hygiene products in order to save money. Although many households qualify for a social water tariff, which can save about £148 a year from the average bill, about five out of six customers who cannot afford their water bill are not receiving the financial support they need. “Water is often overlooked when it comes to saving money but there are many ways to reduce your bill,” Water UK said. “These savings could help free up precious pounds to cover other rising costs, including energy, food and national insurance contributions.” The deepening cost of living crisis facing households has prompted the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to offer a £9bn package of measures from the Treasury to help households shore up their ailing finances. These include a repayable £200 discount off their energy bills in October, while council tax payers in England in bands A to D are to receive a rebate of £150 from their bills in April, which will not have to be paid back. Announcing the support on Thursday, Sunak said the rise in energy costs, which will affect 22m homes, would mean that bill payers would “feel the pinch”, and warned households to brace themselves for further increases in energy costs later this year. “The price rise is so significant that it’s not just those families who are on benefits that are going to feel the pinch, it’s actually middle income families as well,” he said.",Lifestyle/Money,Water bills in England and Wales to rise from April ,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/04/water-bills-in-england-and-wales-to-rise-from-april
