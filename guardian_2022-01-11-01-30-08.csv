1/11/2022,"The maker of hit computer games including the Grand Theft Auto franchise is to acquire Zynga, best known for its FarmVille and Harry Potter titles, in a $12.7bn (£9.4bn) deal that will create a global console and mobile gaming giant. US-listed Take-Two Interactive said the cash and shares deal will create one of the largest publicly-traded interactive entertainment companies in the world.  “We are thrilled to announce our transformative transaction with Zynga, which significantly diversifies our business and establishes our leadership position in mobile, the fastest growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry,” said Strauss Zelnick, chair and chief executive of Take-Two, who added that the deal would result in $100m in cost savings in the first two years following its completion. With hits including FarmVille, Zynga was once the most successful developer on Facebook, and subsequently pivoted to mobile gaming to cash-in on the boom in smartphone ownership. Despite the entertainment boom during a period of successive Covid lockdowns, Zynga’s share price fell by more than a third last year. It surged by almost 50% when news of the Take-Two deal was announced on Monday. “We are incredibly excited to have found a partner in Take-Two that shares our commitment to investing in our players, amplifying our creative culture and generating more value for stockholders,” said Frank Gibeau, chief executive of Zynga. “With this transformative transaction we begin a new journey which will allow us to create even better games, reach larger audiences and achieve significant growth as a leader in the next era of gaming.” Take-Two, which reported $6.1bn in net bookings in the year to the end of September, said it expects mobile gaming to account for at least half of its net bookings in its next financial year, up from 12% in the current year. The deal marks the latest consolidation move in the gaming sector in recent years. Take-Two was outbid by rival Electronic Arts in the £1bn takeover of British video games maker Codemasters in 2020. That same year, Microsoft bought the parent of Bethesda, the company behind games including the Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchises, for $7.5bn. In March last year, Epic, the maker of global hit Fortnite, acquired UK-based Mediatonic, the creator of the smash hit Fall Guys.

1/11/2022,"The cut price chain Wilko is to close up to 15 stores over the coming year with the potential loss of more than 300 jobs. The company, which currently operates 414 outlets across the UK employing 16,000 people, said it was reviewing leases that were coming to an end and would exit stores where favourable terms could not be agreed.  Stores affected include Bournemouth, Grantham, Rotherham, Llanelli, Sutton Coldfield and Cleethorpes. Jerome Saint-Marc, the chief executive of Wilko, said: “There’s no denying the way people shop with us and where they want to shop with us is changing. “As a business we’re evolving and this includes working with landlords for more favourable terms, as well as looking at locations and store formats.” Saint-Marc said staff affected by store closures would be offered jobs in nearby outlets. The group is also planning to open at least one new store in the year ahead, in Blackpool, while the Shrewsbury store will relocate. Roger Jenkins, a national officer for the GMB union, said: “These closures are devastating for Wilko workers and the communities who use them. “It’s yet another nail in the high street’s coffin and GMB calls on councils and landlords to review commercial leases and offer lower rents.” The potential closures come after a tough few years for high street retailers, after a string of high street lockdowns that have accelerated the shift to online shopping. Once-busy city centres have also been knocked by the move to working from home and general anxiety about socialising during the pandemic. Sales at Wilco sank 10.5% in the year to January 2021 to £1.28bn when pretax profits fell almost 13% to £5.5m according to accounts filed at Companies House. In the first year of the pandemic, the company said sales at its high street outlets had suffered from a 40% fall in visitor numbers after the March 2020 lockdown.

1/11/2022,"KPMG has apologised for misconduct and misleading the UK’s accounting regulator over audits including that of Carillion, the major government contractor that collapsed four years ago. Jon Holt, the chief executive of KPMG UK, said it was “clear” that misconduct had occurred, in a statement published to mark the start of a disciplinary tribunal on Monday.  The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has alleged that KPMG misled its investigators over routine inspections of the accountants’ audits of Carillion and Regenersis, a software company. The FRC has alleged that “relevant individuals acted with a lack of integrity in dishonestly or recklessly misleading the regulator”, according to tribunal documents. The tribunal on Monday heard via a public video call allegations of “forgery” by KPMG’s auditors, including the “fabrication” of documents. The FRC’s counsel, Mark Ellison, told the tribunal that auditors manufactured a spreadsheet and minutes of meetings to appear as if they were created during the audits, when in fact they were created months later and presented to inspectors. KPMG reported the alleged misconduct to the regulator, although it remains a party to the disciplinary tribunal alongside some current and former employees and partners. The other respondents have denied allegations of misconduct. Holt said: “It is of course for the tribunal to reach a conclusion on the allegations as they relate to the individuals concerned. Nevertheless, it is clear to me that misconduct has occurred and that our regulator was misled.” “The misconduct that this tribunal will hear about over the coming weeks is disturbing and upsetting for me and for my colleagues, who are committed to serving the public interest with honesty and integrity. “This misconduct is a violation of our processes and clearly against our values. It is unacceptable, we do not tolerate or condone it in any way, and I am very sorry that it occurred in our firm.” The tribunal is expected to hear evidence over the course of several weeks from the FRC and the respondents. The FRC also has two separate investigations concerning the collapse of Carillion, one of the highest-profile accounting scandals in recent years. The current tribunal will not investigate the circumstances of its collapse. Parliamentary committees have said KPMG was “complicit” in Carillion’s “questionable” accounting practices, including “complacently signing off its directors’ increasingly fantastical figures”. Holt said KPMG had worked to ensure the practices covered by the disciplinary tribunal did not represent the wider culture or practice of the firm. He recently wrote to all colleagues to remind them of their duty to report concerns about how the firm and its employees were conducting themselves. The six current and former KPMG employees facing the tribunal have been approached for comment via their lawyers.",News/Business,KPMG says accounting regulator ‘was misled’ over Carillion audits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/10/kpmg-says-accounting-regulator-was-misled-over-carillion-audits
1/11/2022,"Ihadn’t even reached Ithaca, the tiny university town in upstate New York – my home for the next six years, as I studied for a PhD – when the confusion over my Blackness and British accent began. I was ill-prepared for Matt, the skinny white American in a cap sitting beside me on the plane. “But you don’t seem like you’re from London,” he said (I’m from Hackney, and very proud). Matt had never been to the UK, let alone London. This response emerges from the US’s own unique history of race and class. The British accent remains for some the epitome of white privilege, reviving memories of high-born English settlers and exuding an air of aristocracy. Blackness signifies the opposite. The property of those settlers. The lowest of the low. Slaves. And so I was violating the US’s time-worn prejudices. Matt was trying to put me back in my place.  As for Ithaca, its charming Queen Anne homes bear Black Lives Matter signs on their manicured lawns; and, come election night, it is a rare patch of Democrat blue in a sea of red. But, with reports of Confederate flags and Donald and Melania posters in bedroom windows, I think twice when crossing the road at night and hurry when I see a police car: a reflex that is as much response to the state violence that killed George Floyd as the realities of growing up Black in London. My mistaken identity, however, is more than simply a matter of Black and white. Late one evening, I found myself in the company of west African students and, as we ate jollof rice, one stood up to announce they had found me out: that my accent was fake. The group crowded round as my doubter sat me down and put me through a painstaking interrogation. Humoured, I went along with it. I carefully repeated several words, first in my supposedly “fake” British accent and then in my apparently “real” American one. She asked me to sing, listening out for a revealing twang in a croaky rendition of Stevie Wonder’s Lately. On another occasion, a student said she heard in my accent the British imperial soldier in his khaki uniform and pith helmet that colonised her corner of Africa. I found this especially curious because it appeared as though I was being held partly culpable for Britain’s imperial atrocities. Rather, the British accent as voiced by a Black person reveals empire’s underbelly. My own betrays the kidnapping of my African forebears, their trafficking to the Caribbean, a brave resistance against colonialism and my parents’ eventual migration (as British citizens) to the UK as part of the Windrush generation. The cadence of the Black Londoner contains the sounds, forged over centuries, of the colonial consequence the Sri Lankan scholar-activist Ambalavaner Sivanandan spoke of when he said: “We are here because you were there.” However, the days when my Caribbean and American cousins could dismiss me as “English man”, an oddity with no identifiable culture, are thankfully coming to an end. Just as my generation grew up on Black American music – Biggie Smalls, 2Pac and Lauryn Hill – so a younger one has been raised on Black British artists like Skepta, KSI, Giggs, Ella Mai and Khaled Siddiq. Drake has done a lot to introduce UK artists to US audiences, while the TV series Top Boy, featuring Asher D (Ashley Walters), played its part. The direction of cultural exchange has not always been one-way traffic: Paul Gilroy notes a Black Atlantic of diasporic cultural flows that has existed for time immemorial. It’s still remarkable to me though that UK drill music – reformulated from the Chicago-born genre on a Brixton council estate – has found a cult following at my US Ivy League university. There’s also no shortage of Americans willing to embarrass themselves with stabs at “yes bruv” and “wagwan”. It’s music to my ears when I meet up with other Londoners (I’ve counted four so far) and we lay on an accent so thick some poor kid from Nebraska doesn’t know what language we speak. As UK Black culture continues to alter perceptions of race and class, for some Americans, it seems, Britain is starting to look and sound a lot more like Daniel Kaluuya than it does the Queen.

1/11/2022,"To be a Chicago Bulls fan over the past two decades is to somewhat know the true pain of injuring a strong knee or a healthy hand. It takes time to adjust to the idea that the body could be anything less than perfect. And when the mind eventually catches up, alas, it’s beyond frustrating. The Bulls I grew up rooting for were so able. They were led by the shrewdest coach, the finest sidekick and the best player who ever lived. They beat back the Bad Boy Pistons, outran the Showtime Lakers and abused the New York Knicks while distinguishing themselves as the preeminent sports dynasty. As the Last Dance docuseries explicitly showed, the Bulls were a cultural force – one that not only put my overlooked hometown on the map, but made basketball the global game it is today.  But after the 1998 NBA championship, their sixth title in eight seasons, the Bulls’ decline came swiftly. Jerry Krause, the reviled general manager, blew up the team, and over the next five years this once-enviable franchise became one of the league’s worst. Some fight returned in the mid-aughts when hero marksman John Paxson took over as GM and more hope of a return to glory with it when Paxson selected future league MVP Derrick Rose with the top pick in the 2008 draft. But those teams were never as good as LeBron James’s Cleveland Cavaliers. And then after 2017, they weren’t good at all. This season, however, feels different. Familiar. Tingly. It began with modest expectations, and then four victories on the trot – albeit against teams that, like Chicago, missed the postseason a year ago. But then the Bulls’ streak extended to seven in 10 games. After a 10-point drubbing of Dallas for win No 8, Mavericks guard Tim Hardaway Jr finally called it. “All I can say is, the Bulls are back, man,” he asserted after the game. The declaration, while flattering, was also a bit delusional. That the players on the other side of this compliment recognized as much was oddly steadying. “Eleven games into the season I don’t think you can say anybody’s back,” retorted Bulls guard Alex Caruso, “especially for the prestige of the Bulls. They won three championships in a row twice. Being back, that’s a big statement.” But now almost halfway through the season it’s hard not to be carried away by the sight of the Bulls perched atop the Eastern Conference standings after nearly surpassing their win total from last year. What’s more, some of these victories have come at the expense of the Super Nets and the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks. Until a Sunday night loss to Dallas, Chicago were riding a nine-game winning streak– their longest in a decade. Two of those victories would come courtesy of consecutive DeMar DeRozan buzzer-beaters. He hit the second one on New Year’s Day versus Washington, a game that proved to be quite the character study. Here was a Bulls team playing its third game in four on the road, with key players out with injuries or Covid scares, facing a Wizards team that was as hot as they’ve been all season. It was a classic Pack It In game, and it looked as if the Bulls would do just that as Bradley Beal and Kyle Kuzma shot Washington out to a double-digit lead. Chicago never fell too far behind, though. Not with Zach LaVine sinking in buckets from deep, Nikola Vučević controlling the boards and Coby White (filling in for Caruso and starting point guard Lonzo Ball) setting the tempo at both ends. Come the fourth quarter, it was DeRozan’s time to shine. And watching him puncture the Wizards defense with his devastating mid-range game, it was hard not to be reminded of another clutch Bulls shooting guard. After Kuzma knocked down a three-ball to put the Wizards up 119-117 with three second left, the capacity crowd at Capital One Arena crowd was delirious. But there was no panic on the Chicago bench; this was déjà vu, after all. The Bulls coaching staff, missing head man Billy Donovan to the Covid protocol, could’ve angled for overtime. But stunningly and to their immense credit they schemed for the win. They drew up a three-point play for DeRozan, and he sunk it over two defenders in front of his own bench on the way to becoming the first player in history to drill game-winning buzzer-beaters on consecutive days. For as surprising as this Bulls season has unfolded, to say that success has snuck up on them wouldn’t exactly be fair. The first encouraging move came in April 2020 when the organization jettisoned the braindead trust of Paxson and Gar Forman and handed over basketball ops to Artuas Karnisovas, the towering bygone Lithuanian hooper who built Denver into a title threat. Five months later Karnisovas unloaded tarrying interim Jim Boylen for Donovan, a repeat NCAA title winner at Florida who kept Oklahoma City in contention after Kevin Durant bolted to the Bay. A year later the Bulls traded for Vučević, one of the league’s most talented bigs. And while the swap didn’t happen in time for the Bulls to realize a playoff run, still, that was the moment we knew they were serious. Over the summer the Bulls “won” the offseason with their additions of Ball, Caruso and Ayo Dosunmu – a clever rookie guard who’s already paying dividends. But the pièce de résistance has been DeRozan, a 32-year-old former All-Star and Toronto Raptors stalwart whose midrange game was thought to be too retro for today’s three-and-D NBA. Not only has that game and his much-improved three-point stroke proven an ideal complement to LaVine’s slash-and-splash attack, it’s marked DeRozan (originally bound for the Lakers in the offseason) as an early MVP candidate, if not the alpha closer the team had been needing to take things personally. After clinching another win against Orlando despite an uncharacteristically poor free-throw shooting night, DeRozan returned to the United Center floor after the game to heave 250 more shots from the charity stripe. “I was mad,” he explained to ESPN’s NBA Today. “I hate missing free throws. I hate it with a passion. I wasn’t going to feel comfortable leaving the arena until I got some extra shots up.” Bonded and determined, it seems there’s nothing these Next Gen Bulls can’t do or be. “To me, the ceiling is the finals,” former NBA tough guy Matt Barnes said on NBA Today. On his podcast ex-sharpshooter JJ Redick compared this year’s Bulls to last year’s Suns. Just to be clear: no Bulls fan is ready to go all the way here just yet. There’s still so much to figure out – whether the Bulls can bang with the Sixers’ Joel Embiid (who was undeniable in their early November matchups), if they can shoot with the Suns or the Warriors – who just got Klay Thompson back. And then of course no team becomes an NBA champion without having their heart broken first. In Chicago, a once-noble title town, sports now leave locals colder than a lake-effect gale. Apart from the WNBA championship-winning Sky, it’s a bleak landscape. The Cubs have reverted to being losers, minus the lovable part. The White Sox have disappointed. The Bears are a dumpster fire, and the NHL’s Blackhawks remains an off-ice embarrassment. But the Bulls have brought that old, warm prideful feeling back. At this point I imagine many Bulls fans are like me: more than content to root for a team that is talented and trying hard while debating whether to risk seeing them live during the pandemic. And, well, all things being Covid, maybe this feeling is no fluke. Maybe this squad is finally strong enough to inspire turn thoughts from The Last Dance to, now – The Next Chance. “The goal is the championship,” DeRozan told NBA Today. “We’re not gonna cut ourselves short.”",Sport/Sport,The Bulls are back: How Chicago went from Last Dance to Next Chance,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/chicago-bulls-nba-contenders-resurgence
1/11/2022,"England’s Environment Agency has told its staff to “shut down” and ignore reports of low-impact pollution events because it does not have enough money to investigate them, according to a leaked internal report. The ruling on so-called “category 3 and 4” incidents mean that events such as farm pollution or hazardous dumps by business may not be properly investigated. The decision has infuriated river groups and NGOs.  An Environment Agency briefing to staff, issued in November and seen by the Guardian and the Ends Report, says that there is leadership support for “no response to unfunded low- and no-impact environmental incidents”, also known as category 3 and 4 incidents. The leaked document also hints at the agency’s own frustration at ministers and the money set aside for its work. It says the EA’s leadership team has “made it clear to government that you get the environment you pay for”. Exceptions to the rule will be pollution incidents caused by a regulated site or a water company, says the briefing, although it does not explain how it will determine the source or seriousness of an incident if it is not attended or investigated.Ignoring the huge number of pollution reports that come in each year will have benefits, says the agency’s briefing, including “reduced overall effort spent on the incidents that present the lowest risk to the environment”, increased effort on “charge funded regulation”, more space to prioritise higher-risk incidents, “increased consistency of response and service for customers”, and reduced disruption to officers in and out of hours.In an Environment Agency presentation, also seen by the Guardian, on what is known internally as the incident triage project, the agency states that it currently responds to more than 70,000 incidents each year, and the number continues to increase. However, data from the agency’s National Incident Recording System shows that while 116,000 potential incidents were reported to the agency in 2021, just 8,000 were attended and that this number had fallen from 12,000 in 2016, when 74,000 potential incidents were reported.“We cannot keep trying to do what we are not funded to do; we do not have the money or resources,” states the presentation deck. “We are in an unsustainable position. Our incident responders feel under growing pressure, and this is affecting staff resilience and wellbeing.”Should staff hear of a category 3 or 4 incident that does not relate to a water company or a regulated site, they are told: “Do not substantiate report, call site or add any details. Shut down report.” Template reply letters have been created for agency staff in anticipation of complaints.The agency’s customer service commitment says the regulator had its budget for responding to environmental incidents cut last year and that as well as slashing responses it will no longer provide feedback on any action taken to tackle pollution events. It follows many years of grant-in-aid cuts for the agency. However, the government gave Defra and its agencies an additional £4.3bn in the latest spending review in October 2021. An overview of the Environment Agency’s settlement is due this year.Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Rivers Trust, called the move an “appalling scandal”. “Category 1 and 2 pollution incidents obviously have a very serious impact on the environment, but they are the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority of incidents are in lower categories, and they are what cause the death of rivers by a thousand cuts,” he said.Lloyd said the agency needs the “resources and political backing to take robust action in all cases of pollution if our rivers are not to continue suffering endemic pollution and an ongoing decline in quality … It is absolutely essential that there should be a credible threat of enforcement for all pollution incidents if we are to restore our rivers to good health for the next generation.” Ignoring pollution incidents risks people giving up on reporting them in the first place, according to Fish Legal’s head of practice, Penny Gane. “Many of our members gave up reporting pollution incidents some time ago because they didn’t feel that the agency was interested,” she said. Any further drop in reports “will paint a much rosier picture than the reality of our deteriorating rivers and it will be much harder for the agency to build a case for more funding”.Gane is also concerned about the way in which the reduction in responses will be managed. “Without attending an incident, how can they possibly know whether it is being caused by a regulated site or a water company? In practice, they’re talking about agricultural pollution, which the Environment Agency has identified as the main threat to water quality and reason for waterbody failures in England.Rivers campaigner Feargal Sharkey sees the move as a more cynical one. “The obscenity is that the Environment Agency has reduced its own staff to nothing more than political pawns in a cheap game of Whitehall politics. It’s unwarranted, it’s unjust, it’s incompetent,” he saidAn Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We focus our incident response effort on those pollution incidents which pose the greatest risk to the environment.“Our incident triage project is looking at how we can best use our resources and maximise benefits for the environment. While we continue to attend the most serious incidents, we concentrate our efforts on our regulatory activities which prevent incidents from happening in the first place. Intelligence from incident reporting helps us to plan and prioritise our work to protect the environment.”",News/Environment,"Ignore reports of low-impact pollution events, Environment Agency tells staff",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/ignore-low-impact-pollution-events-environment-agency-staff
1/11/2022,"After its humiliating 23-5 drubbing by the Irish at last year’s Cheltenham Festival, the good news for British jumps racing following the weekend’s action is that the first race of the 2022 Festival, the Supreme Novice Hurdle on 15 March, is looking like a banker for the home team. Constitution Hill was deeply impressive as he quickened clear on the bridle to win the Tolworth Hurdle at Sandown on Saturday and is now a worthy 9-4 favourite; his biggest rival may well be Jonbon (3-1), a stable companion at the Nicky Henderson yard. The bad news, however, is that the rest of the meeting threatens to be a case of what the late Yogi Berra described as “deja vu all over again”.  There are 19 non-handicap races at the Festival and Irish-trained runners currently head the market in 17. Henderson’s Shishkin, in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, is the only other ante-post favourite stabled in Britain. The nine handicaps are much more open, and British yards will account for the majority of the runners – but they had two-thirds of the handicap runners last time around, and Ireland still went home with seven wins from nine. It was against this distinctly unpromising backdrop that Ruth Quinn, the British Horseracing Authority’s director of international racing and racing development, released details last week of what the BHA plans to do to “ensure [Irish] raiding parties in future years face even stiffer opposition”. Quinn chaired the BHA’s Quality Jump Racing Review Group, which was formed in May in the aftermath of the thrashing at Cheltenham, and a Grand National at Aintree in which 10 of the first 11 home were trained in Ireland. The group came up with five aims and two recommendations, none of which will make any difference this season but might, they hope, start to restore a little parity from 2023. The aims include seeing “Britain’s best horses more regularly running against each other outside of the Festival”, to “encourage more of the sport’s highest-investing owners to have their horses trained in Britain”, and to “neutralise prize money as a consideration for owners when decisions are taken about whether a horse is trained in Britain or Ireland”. To this end, the recommendations are that Britain should “incentivise greater competition between the sport’s leading horses in all divisions by implementing significant change to the jump pattern and listed programme”, and “deliver a significant prize-money increase” for jumping, with increased minimum levels to encourage owners to run their horses outside the major Festivals. These are sensible ambitions, and suggest British racing is waking up to the possibility that these things are not “always cyclical” and bound to turn around soon enough, as has often been claimed in the past. The nub of the issue, though, as the Review Group seems to appreciate, is the regularity with which Ireland has outperformed its representation at Cheltenham for the best part of a decade. This suggests that while Britain has many more jumping horses – with 33,000 starts over jumps in 2021 compared to just under 20,000 in Ireland – a significant and consistent majority of the very best of them are on the other side of the Irish Sea. Even a “significant” boost to the prize money on offer in Britain may do little to address this imbalance, because Ireland’s allure for the super-rich owners who increasingly dominate the winter game is about more than just the money on offer. The rewards for top-class jumps horses are certainly attractive, and consciously directed towards Graded races rather than handicaps, but that reflects a top-down appreciation of racing and breeding’s significance to the Irish economy as a whole, and its rural economy in particular.

The rate doubled from 1% to 2% in 2019, following lobbying by the horse and greyhound racing industries. Covid has had an impact on funding in Ireland as it did on prize money in the UK last year, but the fundamentals of the Irish model are sound, and consistent success for Irish horses in Britain and elsewhere boosts betting turnover and, as a result, the tax take as well. It is a virtuous circle that the UK industry is never likely to match and while last year’s Festival set a very high bar, the latest odds suggest either 19 or 20 winners as Ireland’s most likely return, with 23 or more on offer at just 12-1.

1/11/2022,"For nearly two years, a small army of lawyers has been trying to decide who to blame for Grenfell Tower’s dangerous cladding. At the outset of the latest phase of the public inquiry into the disaster, lead counsel warned the organisations involved against indulging in “a merry-go-round of buck-passing”. Some chance.  After hundreds of hours of hearings where architects have blamed builders, builders have blamed manufacturers and manufacturers have blamed regulators, a conclusion about why 72 people died after their homes were wrapped in plastic that burned like petrol is still months away. Michael Gove now faces a similar problem as he seeks to pin responsibility for similar failures on not just one, but thousands of apartment buildings across England. It is a quagmire that has defeated several cabinet predecessors in charge of housing, to the anguish of hundreds of thousands of people whose homes have been rendered worthless. “We want to try and cut through that,” the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities declared on Monday morning. Gove’s plan – to give developers until March to come up with a plan to foot the £4bn bill to fix cladding on medium-rise blocks – rests on giving the housebuilders very little room for manoeuvre and stopping them from pointing the finger elsewhere, at least in the first place. His team understand that the problem requires an urgent fix, not least with the fifth anniversary of the Grenfell fire looming in June and backbench MPs facing considerable pressure from constituents whose lives are in turmoil. They also recognise it doesn’t solve everyone’s building safety problems. But they have decided to start here. Gove will threaten to strip builders of valuable government contracts and access to subsidies such as the help-to-buy programme unless they promise to do two things: “Fund and undertake all necessary remediation of buildings over 11 metres that you have played a role in developing” and “make financial contributions this year and in subsequent years to a dedicated fund to cover the full outstanding cost to remediate unsafe cladding on 11-to 18-metre buildings”. The punishments for inaction could include a new law requiring them to pay, restricted access to government funding and public contracts, the pursuit of companies through the courts and even using planning powers to make their operations difficult. Gove has one more “blunt but heavy instrument” in his armoury: a tax hike. The government has already consulted on a new 4% tax on profits of residential property developers to raise £200m a year to help fund remediation works. This could be increased and the Treasury has given Gove permission to “use a high level threat of tax … as a means of gaining voluntary contributions from [developers]”. Some observers believe this will be a sufficiently tight vice to trigger action. They calculate housebuilders cannot afford to wreck their relationship with the government and will pay up and consider pursuing materials manufacturers and others with threats of legal action of their own. Stewart Baseley, the executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, hinted at what may be to come when he accepted that leaseholders should not have to pay for remediation, but said builders should not cover the costs alone. The implication was: what about the companies like Kingspan and Arconic that made combustible cladding materials? What about the subcontractors who may have assembled them wrongly? If Gove doesn’t manage to quickly reach the £4bn target from the developers (and remember, previous appeals for developers to do the right thing failed), his department’s own coffers could be raided. That is an unappealing prospect given Gove’s responsibility for Downing Street’s flagship levelling up policy and the urgent need to keep investing in social housing. “Leaseholders shouldn’t pay, the polluter should pay and we want to work with everyone involved to get to a constructive solution,” Gove said on Monday.

1/11/2022,"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said MPs should not receive a pay rise in April, given the severe cost of living squeeze facing the public in the coming months. MPs’ basic pay was frozen at £81,932 last year by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), the watchdog that sets parliamentary salaries, but it is yet to make a recommendation for 2022-23.  Starmer told broadcasters: “I think that MPs do not need a pay rise and we should all be saying that we don’t need that pay rise and it shouldn’t go ahead. “The mechanism is independent but I think it’s for me, as leader of the opposition, to say that I do not think we should have that pay rise.” Earlier, the prime minister’s official spokesman said Boris Johnson would expect Ipsa to show “restraint”, when setting pay for this year. “We would expect restraint on this, given current circumstances,” he said. The cost of living has shot up the political agenda in recent weeks, with domestic energy prices set to rise sharply, and the national insurance increase due to take effect in April. Economy-wide inflation hit 5.1% in November. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a cabinet minister, has called privately for the tax increase to be reversed, given the tough economic backdrop – but the proceeds are already earmarked to fund the extensive NHS backlog and tackle the crisis in social care. Johnson met the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Sunday to discuss possible measures for alleviating the squeeze on households – though the government has also continued to point to the existing measures in place, including the warm homes discount scheme. Johnson suggested at prime minister’s questions last week that the warm homes discount amounted to £140 a week for eligible households. It is in fact £140 a year. Ipsa was set up in the wake of the MPs’ expenses scandal, to remove political influence from decisions about pay and expenses for elected representatives. It usually recommends that MPs’ pay increases in line with an official measure of public sector pay growth known as KAC9; but it decided that was unrepresentative because of the distortions created by the Covid pandemic, and held pay fixed for 2021-22. After a consultation last year, Ipsa then announced that for the financial years beginning 2022, 2023 and 2024 it would continue to set the rate itself, because the after-effects of the pandemic meant official data would continue to be a “less reliable guide than usual to the underlying rate of wage growth”. Annual public sector pay growth in the three months to October was 2.7%, according to the Office for National Statistics.",News/Politics,"MPs should not get pay rise, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/mps-should-not-get-pay-rise-says-keir-starmer
1/11/2022,"Martina Navratilova responded to Novak Djokovic’s release from immigration detention on Monday by saying the “unbelievable” chain of events could have been avoided if he had simply been vaccinated while Rafael Nadal branded the situation “a circus”. A judge ordered Djokovic’s visa cancellation be quashed after determining unreasonableness in the way that the Australian Border Force had conducted its procedures during the world No 1’s entry interview at Tullamarine airport last week. However, Djokovic could still be denied the right to defend his Australian Open title next week if the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, cancels his visa again.  Djokovic had been sent to Melbourne’s Park Hotel last Thursday awaiting deportation after officials determined his medical exemption due to a previous covid infection to compete at the Australian Open which starts on Monday 17 January, was not valid under federal law. Dramatic scenes followed the judge’s decision outside the offices of Djokovic’s lawyers at the Rialto Tower in central Melbourne when vocal Serbian supporters were pepper-sprayed by police after clambering on to a vehicle they believed to be transporting the tennis player following his release. Navratilova, who won a record 59 major titles, told Good Morning Britain that everything was “getting crazier by the minute” and that Djokovic should have put others’ health before his own ambitions. “It’s unbelievable, what a saga. It could have been avoided. I just wish Novak had taken that vaccination to begin with,’ the 65-year-old said. ‘I admire him so much but I can’t defend the choice to not get vaccinated. “You have to take one for the team. It’s getting crazier by the minute. We’re in such close contact in the locker rooms. I couldn’t wait to get vaccinated. I admire Novak and I know what it takes to be that committed. “I would be much more scared of getting sick from not being vaccinated than whatever side effects I might have from the vaccination. You really need to be more aware of everybody else.” Nadal, who is level with Roger Federer and Djokovic with 20 grand slam titles apiece, joked that he would prefer the Serbian didn’t play at the upcoming Australian Open after describing the fallout from the controversy as a “circus”. “Whether or not I agree with Djokovic on some things, justice has spoken and has said that he has the right to participate in the Australian Open and I think it is the fairest decision to do so, if it has been resolved that way. I wish him the best of luck,” Nadal told Spanish radio Onda Cero on Monday. “On a personal level, I’d much rather he didn’t play,” Nadal said, laughing along with interviewer. “It’s sports, many interests move around it, on a general level, at an economic, advertising level. Everything is much better when the best can be playing,” Nadal said, before once again defending vaccination. “The most important institutions in the world say that the vaccine is the way to stop this pandemic and the disaster that we have been living for the last 20 months.” Other players past and present also weighed in. John Isner, the American world No 24, who has been a prominent supporter of Djokovic’s situation tweeted: “Only thing left to do is win the trophy again and leave town never to return ...” while Spain’s Feliciano López posted: “Judge Kelly solving the mess-disaster-absurdity that other parties involved have created. Tennis wins #AO2022.” The British player Laura Robson, however, focused on the plight of refugees and asylum seekers without Djokovic’s resources who remained at the immigration hotel, asking: “What about the other people still stuck in the Park hotel? Elsewhere, some were keen to move on with the former Australian Open chief executive, Paul McNamee, tweeting: “Djokovic has had his day in court, with all the evidence presented, and comprehensively won … let’s respect the court’s decision and move to the other court where sport is played.” Whether Djokovic can do that or not is now in Hawke’s hands.",Sport/Sport,‘Circus’ that could have been avoided: tennis world reacts to Djokovic decision,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/circus-that-could-have-been-avoided-tennis-world-reacts-to-djokovic-decision
