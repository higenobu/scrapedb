4/16/2022,"The kati roll is kind of Bengali street food. It was in London, rather than the bustling streets of Kolkata, that I first tried one. Dreamed up at some point in the early 20th century, kati rolls are traditionally made with grilled meat, which becomes the filling for a rolled, egg-fried paratha, that deliciously fatty and flaky Indian flatbread. Although I use frozen parathas from my local south Asian grocer, you could instead use mini tortillas, which are lighter and more readily available. I’ve filled mine with paneer, but you could substitute with two fried chicken breasts or another meat, if you prefer. The DIY required for kati rolls is reminiscent of fajitas. Serve the egg-fried parathas, onions, chutney and paneer in separate bowls, so everyone can assemble their own roll at the table. Prep 10 minCook 30 minMakes 4 (a hearty dinner for 2, or lunch snack for 4) For the rollsVegetable oil, for frying4 parathas, or mini tortillas2 large eggs, beaten with 2 pinches of table salt For the filling125g Greek yoghurt1 tsp ground cumin½ tsp ground turmeric¼ tsp salt250g paneer, cut into large cubes For the onions3 medium red onions (about 350g), peeled and thinly sliced3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 tbsp lemon juice For the green chutney70g fresh coriander (leaves and stems), roughly torn2-3 green bird’s eye chillies, split down the middle and seeds removed½ garlic clove, peeled and minced40g white onion, chopped2 tbsp lemon juice First make the chutney: blitz the coriander, chillies, garlic, onion and lemon juice with one or two tablespoons of water, until you have a smooth sauce, then transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Now for the onions. Warm a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the onions and garlic, and fry for three to four minutes, until the onions have started to soften but still have some crunch. Stir in the lemon juice and set aside. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. To prepare the paneer, mix the yoghurt, cumin, turmeric and salt in a large bowl, then dip the cheese in the yoghurt mix to coat it. Lay the paneer on a greased oven tray and bake for 15 minutes. While the paneer is cooking, fry the parathas (or flatbread of choice). Put a little oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, then fry one bread for 30 seconds on each side, just until it has started to brown, then pour over a quarter of the beaten eggs. Using tongs, flip over the bread and move it around the pan for 20-30 seconds, until the egg is set and stuck to the bread. Set aside on a plate and repeat with the remaining three breads and eggs. Take everything to the table, and assemble. Lay a generous helping of onions down the middle of one bread, followed by some of the paneer and a drizzle of the chutney, roll up and enjoy.

4/16/2022,"We think of a dystopia as an imaginary place in the future. When Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale in 1985, she said everything in the novel had already happened: Iran, China, Romania. Today she might have said Afghanistan, where musicians have been forced to parade with their instruments tied around their necks. Or Palm Beach, where Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking rituals resemble treatment meted out to the young women in Atwood’s Gilead. Or, in any respect, daily, hourly, events in Ukraine. The Danish composer Poul Ruders (b1949) understood the novel’s resonance early. His 2000 opera, with a libretto by Paul Bentley, was given its UK premiere at English National Opera in 2003. Streamlined (to a degree) and reworked, it is now back at the London Coliseum, the directorial debut choice of Annilese Miskimmon, ENO’s artistic director. Joana Carneiro, assured and precise, conducts an exemplary performance. Stylish, unfussy designs are by Annemarie Woods, with Paule Constable’s lighting. Last time, despite moments of brilliance in Phyllida Lloyd’s production, The Handmaid’s Tale was a dour, noisy and crushing affair. Those – I include myself – who struggled with the book found the opera equally unapproachable. Relationships between leading characters, normally the heart of opera, felt robotic and remote. Much in this new version has improved, even if some of the work’s raw guts has been lost in the process. The story is clearer, helped by surtitles (not yet in use in 2003) – a reflection on the complexities of the narrative, not on any inadequate diction. Ruders’s detailed orchestral colours are never dull, swerving from the sweet tonality of Amazing Grace (quoted in the score) to aggressive dissonance, enhanced by a battery or instruments from harpsichord and piano to xylophone, bells, gongs, woodblocks, unidentifiable grindings and sizzlings and the insistent ambush of a large bass drum. Every aspect of the singing and production is impressive, fluently staged with a backdrop of drapes and a few mobile set pieces such as The Wall. The women of English National Opera’s chorus have many opportunities to shine, and do. The hardworking ENO orchestra excels. In the central role of Offred, the formidable Kate Lindsey, affecting both as versatile singer and actor, gives a committed performance. Her almost constant presence on stage gives focus and heart, especially in her delicate, soft singing, accompanied by solo harp. Emma Bell’s compelling but thanklessly high-pitched Aunt Lydia, Avery Amereau’s superbly creepy Serena Joy, with Susan Bickley, Rhian Lois, Pumeza Matshikiza, Elin Pritchard and more, lead a strong ensemble. Robert Hayward makes a powerful and sinister Commander, with the tenor Frederick Ballentine charming as his equivocal sidekick Nick. Camille Cottin (of Call My Agent!), as the professor leading the symposium that frames the action, is an attractive if puzzling bonus. Ruders has said the novel’s impact hit him gradually, like “a slow, painful strangulation”. This mood translates to the experience of watching it. We care, unquestionably, intellectually, about the totalitarian horrors depicted, but the individuals remain elusive, their true selves glimpsed only in shadowy flashback. That toxic pummelling of humankind, reduced to facelessness, may be the point. There’s a fine line, however, between art that shakes us to the core and shows us the pity of suffering, and art that leaves us depressed and gloomy. For me, despite best efforts, The Handmaid’s Tale, as book, TV, opera, falls into the second category. Optimism, and plenty of it, came nonetheless in the quality of work on show here, proof that ENO is on an up, even if I left on a down. The seven-day Easter festival at St John’s Smith Square, which ends tomorrow afternoon, usually includes at least one unappreciated novelty. This year the rosette must go to Marcel Dupré’s Le Chemin de la Croix (1931), a sequence for organ on the 14 stations of the cross, performed by Martin Baker. Dupré (1886-1971) was a teacher of Olivier Messiaen. It’s a reason to seek his music out, a mainstay for organists but not for the rest of us. You hear the seeds of ideas and structures that Messiaen pushed to bolder horizons. Capable of much that is stirring and eerily mystical, Dupré has his moments: the 11th station, Jesus Is Nailed on the Cross, invites the organist to attack the instrument with obsessive hammer blows, which Baker did emphatically, followed by fragmented, hushed music of consolation. While it helped that Baker announced each station to guide us through, the meditative flow was interrupted: sometimes a cloud of unknowing is the better option. Under the guidance of its Kyiv-born chief conductor, Kirill Karabits, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra has introduced music from former Soviet states in its ongoing Voices from the East series. The latest concert from Lighthouse, Poole, still available online (£10), featured a world premiere by Franghiz Ali-Zadeh, from Azerbaijan. NIZAMI Cosmology, colourful and expansive, giving voice to many solo instruments, celebrates the 12th-century Persian poet-astronomer Nizami. He observed the movement of celestial bodies and tried, as well he might, to explain how the size and brightness or stars and comets influenced life on earth. Ali-Zadeh, 75 next month, was there to take her bow. The response from the Dorset audience, towards musicians, conductor, composer, was heartfelt: a reminder, if ever it was needed, of music’s own cosmic power to connect.

4/16/2022,"Outside of Joe Wicks and suppliers of PPE with links to the Conservative party, few people did as well out of lockdown as Dua Lipa. At least, that’s the received wisdom about how an already successful pop singer’s career shot into a rarified realm, where Madonna and Elton John offered to collaborate with her and five million people shelled out for her pay-per-view livestreamed gig. Released just as lockdown hit, Lipa’s second album, Future Nostalgia, turned out to be exactly what people wanted to listen to in their constrained circumstances: shiny dancefloor-focused pop, thick with knowing references to the charts of the past, that conjured enticing nightlife fantasies of what might happen when they were allowed out. How exactly we got here is a question that hangs over the opening date of her much-postponed UK tour, not least during a section where Lipa sings We’re Good while being menaced, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, by a giant inflatable lobster. Watching her blast through her hits and precision-tooled dance routines, you are struck by the sense that she doesn’t really conform to latterday notions of how a pop star should be. She isn’t the kind of powerhouse singer who decorates her vocals with elaborate curlicues and tracery – her voice’s strength is its hint of husky intimacy, which vanishes live – nor is her show the kind of eye-popping spectacle that dazzles you into submission, inflatable lobster notwithstanding. There’s some fantastic staging, particularly when she and her dancers take to a smaller stage in the centre of the crowd and a square lighting rig descends: hemmed in by its beams, they effectively conjure up the atmosphere of a nightclub dancefloor. Equally, there are points where it can seem a little low-wattage. A balloon drop during One Kiss looks like it’s been subject to the cost-of-living crisis: there really aren’t that many balloons. She looks fantastic in a sparkly catsuit, but hers is not a career founded on bewitching charisma or outsized personality. In an era where the key to pop success is supposed to be relatability, she exudes a kind of cool, well-spoken distance: “Like modern architecture,” she sings during Future Nostalgia’s title track, “John Lautner coming your way”. But a huge star she undoubtedly is, complete with an arena full of fans going nuts at whatever she does, even when what she does is the stuff pop starlets playing arenas invariably do: a dance routine that involves sitting backwards on a chair, a moment where she’s hoisted aloft by her dancers and carried prone around the stage, still singing. And the gig also provides an answer to why, albeit a prosaic one. What Dua Lipa has, and has in profusion, is a noticeably better class of song than any of her British pop peers. It was a state of affairs noticeable on her debut album, as underlined by the night’s performance of New Rules, a confection made entirely of earworms and memorable lines (“if you’re under him, you’re not getting over him”), and one that becomes unignorable when the set draws on Future Nostalgia. Tonight, songs that appeared potentiated by the privations of lockdown feel even more potent ripped from the context of the kitchen disco and rattled out at a breathless pace: Love Again’s canny reworking of the old Al Bowlly sample first used on White Town’s 1997 hit Your Woman; Break My Heart, with its knowing echo of INXS’s Need You Tonight. An artist with a plethora of hits, she’s smart enough not to deviate from the script with anything unexpected – like a house DJ’s set, the tempo is more-or-less fixed throughout; the mid-paced beats of Cool are about as slow as her set gets – and she keeps the interludes between anthems as brief as possible. Indeed, occasionally the interludes are non-existent: a version of Hallucinate elides into a take on Cold Heart, her collaboration with Elton John, the latter appearing in video form. Rather than outsize personality or powerhouse vocals, this is exactly what people want at this precise moment in history: a live show that delivers on Future Nostalgia’s lockdown promise of uncomplicated good times and seamless big tunes.",Arts/Music,Dua Lipa review – the best song catalogue in British pop today,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/16/dua-lipa-review-the-best-song-catalogue-in-british-pop-today
4/16/2022,"Formed in 1997 by the management team who put together the Spice Girls, 5ive were the bad boys of pop known for bust-ups and big hits such as Keep On Movin’ and Everybody Get Up. The band split acrimoniously in 2001, and reformed without Jason “J” Brown for reality show The Big Reunion in 2013. Abz Love left in 2014, so 5ive now consist of Sean Conlon, Ritchie Neville and Scott Robinson. This year they released Time, their first album in two decades. My memory of this photo is I was glad we were lying down so I could half rest while working. I’m carrying a bit of weight; we were eating a lot of junk at the time, quick fixes. Once we started doing OK, I said to management: “Look, we’re going to die if we keep eating like this.” So they upped the ante on the food. I came across the advert for 5ive auditions in a newspaper. It was a photo of the actor Paul Nicholls’ head and Peter Andre’s body, and the headline was “Do You Want to be a Spice Boy?” My instant reaction was, oh, give me a break! Then the cogs started turning and I applied. The auditions were like a circus. Tribute acts, people breakdancing. I swayed from side to side feeling very awkward and sang George Michael’s Freedom. It went from 3,000 people to 14. Once we were all in the same room, they had the final five within 30 minutes. I reckoned Scott was gobby and thought a lot of himself, while Sean was a bit moody and abrasive. Now that I know him, I realise that was his way of dealing with nerves. I could tell management wanted me to be the Baby Spice of the group. I liked Nirvana and dance music – I ran off to Glastonbury to see the Prodigy when I was 15 – so I wanted to rebel against that role for a long time. The more exhausted the five of us got, the more we would fight – punches and kicks were thrown. I remember walking past a pet shop and seeing this puppy. It was the runt of the pack and all the other dogs were biting and climbing over it. I saw myself, so I walked in and said, “How much for that dog?” I bought it then and there. After the band broke up, I moved to Australia and we lost touch. I wanted to be anonymous. I shut the door, became a recluse for years and probably had a bit of a drinking problem. One day I was in Pizza Express and Coldplay was playing. I was in floods of tears and felt so mixed up. I realised all I wanted to do was music. This time 5ive are far more functional and less anxiety-ridden. I know the other two are going to turn up for the gig on time, do the show well and go home having put food on the table for our kids. That’s all that matters. I would have been 16 when this was taken. I was definitely a lad, and the term boyband didn’t sit well with me at all. Before I joined 5ive, I was writing songs at home. I had an A in GCSE music, but was absent for all my other exams. I joined thinking it was a way to get into the industry, but we ended up getting really big. There was no turning back. I had a very humble childhood living in a council house. When I joined 5ive, we used to get paid £100 a week – it felt like winning the lottery. It all got spent on alcohol. Being bad was part of our marketing – every time we were in the tabloids, we’d panic, but Simon Cowell would say: “Perfect! It’s going great!” I found it hard being away from my family. I was only 15 when I left, so I used to cry quite a bit. I was a child, and felt totally overwhelmed. I’d do signings in shops and could barely look up at the fans. The boys knew I was struggling. They were supportive of me, but I had a bit of a breakdown. Eventually, I started to go to counselling and they suggested I shouldn’t go back to the group. The record company told the press I had glandular fever and ended up using a cardboard cutout of me for the Let’s Dance video. After that the band split up. We’re not as boisterous as we were the first time around. We’re men. Dads. Still like a good drink, though – only now we know when to go to bed. This shot was done by a photographer who did a lot of our shoots; he’d shut one eye to take the photo, and the other one would look big and weird. I remember him on a ladder above us, his bulbous eye looming over us. I always wanted spiky hair, but knew I’d never get away with it unless I was a pop star because it’s a bit out there. As soon as I got into 5ive, I said to management: “I know exactly the hairstyle I want.” They said no, but I managed to persuade them. I thought: this is it! I’ve nailed it! One time I was spiking my hair up in a hotel bathroom before we went to record We Will Rock You. I got Abz to come in and see if it was looking OK at the back. He’d been smoking a cigar in the bedroom and left it unattended. When we turned around, the whole room was ablaze. Using wet towels over our heads, we crawled out, and just as we were about to escape, Abz goes: “No, man, my Timberland boots!” I went: “Leave your boots! It’s not worth it!” We got treated for minor burns and smoke inhalation. Everyone thought it was really funny, but it was actually quite traumatic. The record label wanted a boyband with a bit of an edge, but ours was pretty sharp. We were all close, but had so much so young, it was always going to end badly. One time I tried to leave the group after a fight with J. In a meeting with management, I told them: “I’m not myself, there’s something wrong. I want out.” Instead of trying to get help for me, they said I couldn’t leave, so I lost it. I pinned Richard [Griffiths, the band’s manager] up against the wall, and Simon Cowell was trying to fight me off him. I stayed in the group a bit longer, but it was tough. For his own reasons, J didn’t want to rejoin the group, and I’ve got nothing against him. Before the Big Reunion, we went for a pint and I said: “I’m bigger than you now – I’m not the little boy you bullied before.” We had a really open, good chat as men, and I respect his decision to step away. About eight years ago, Abz tweeted saying he’d left 5ive too. I was sad he couldn’t even pick up the phone and tell me. We haven’t spoken since. Because of the hurt and the pain from my time in 5ive, I never thought I’d be able to sing the songs again. Before the Big Reunion I was doing solo gigs and covering tracks like Sex on Fire. One day my wife, Kerry, said, “Sing Keep on Moving”. I was reluctant, but did it. The crowd went wild. I realised, what am I shying away from? These songs are incredible. I turned my negativity into something positive, and for that I’m proud.",Lifestyle/Life and style,5ive look back: ‘The label wanted a boyband with an edge – ours was pretty sharp’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/16/boyband-5ive-look-back-so-much-so-young-end-badly
4/16/2022," This year’s 150th anniversary of Ralph Vaughan Williams’s birth has prompted welcome pairings of his music with some of his composer associates. Among his most gifted students was Elizabeth Maconchy (1907-94), who praised his inspirational teaching not for technical instruction but for pushing her to the highest artistic ideals and banishing all risk of “cheap effects”. Songs of Elizabeth Maconchy & Ralph Vaughan Williams, Volume 1 (Resonus), sung by James Greer (tenor) with Ronald Woodley (piano), combines the familiar and novel. Vaughan Williams’s cycle Songs of Travel is given new buoyancy when sung by a tenor instead of the more usual baritone. Maconchy’s songs, mostly unpublished and some recovered from manuscripts, span 70 years, moving from simple lyric to modernist invention. The dramatic scene Faustus (1971) shows Maconchy at the height of her game, giving equal authority to voice and piano, performed with persuasive urgency by Greer and Woodley. This is the first of two discs. I look forward to the next.  With a Finnish first violinist, Welsh second, Irish violist and English cellist, there’s no easy way to sum up the Castalian String Quartet, let alone the music they play, often written for another medium altogether. Between Two Worlds (Delphian), on a loose theme of darkness to light, has Beethoven’s late quartet, No 15 in A minor, Op 132, at its heart, beautifully sprung, precise and detailed. The pivotal “thanksgiving” slow movement is taut and serene. A compelling reason to buy the disc is Thomas Adès’s The Four Quartets, Op 28 (2011), tracing the course of the day from the whispered harmonics of Nightfalls to the zestful pizzicatos of Morning Dew, the persistent ostinatos of Days and the disrupted fictions of The Twenty-Fifth Hour. The album opens with La nuit froide et sombre by Orlando de Lassus, and closes with John Dowland’s Come, Heavy Sleep, both arranged by the group’s first violinist, Sini Simonen. Many quartets have broken the tradition of single-composer discs. The Castalians do it with top performances and meticulous imagination.  Two operas on TV: Scottish Opera’s production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Gondoliers, with the brilliant Richard Suart as the Duke of Plaza-Toro, is on BBC Four tomorrow tonight at 8pm. And go to BBC iPlayer for Danielle DeNiese in Poulenc’s one-woman opera La Voix Humaine, conducted by Antonio Pappano.",Arts/Music,Classical home listening: Elizabeth Maconchy and Vaughan Williams; Castalian Quartet,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/16/songs-elizabeth-maconchy-vaughan-williams-volume-1-review-james-greer-ronald-woodley-castalian-string-quartet-between-two-worlds-the-gondoliers-bbc-four-la-voix-humaine
4/16/2022,"Fancy a relaxing two-week getaway where you get your travel expenses paid, plus your own en suite room with all mod cons including a TV, PlayStation games console and free wifi? What’s more, it won’t cost you anything – in fact, they are so keen for you to come that you’ll be paid £4,200. If that sounds appealing, then you might want to think about booking a stay at FluCamp. However, as the name suggests, there’s a catch to this “holiday”: FluCamp runs residential clinical trials in the UK to test potential treatments for colds and flu. It is one of a number of companies and organisations offering sizeable payments – up to £7,000 in some cases – plus “restaurant-standard” meals and other perks to tempt people to take part in clinical drugs trials. As well as the money, you will also have the satisfaction of knowing you are helping to advance medical science, just like the thousands who have taken part in Covid-19 vaccine trials. Adverts appealing for volunteers for paid clinical trials have been appearing in newspapers such as Metro, and the websites of a number of healthcare organisations are currently recruiting people. Some are even offering “refer a friend” payments. The trials are to test medicines and treatments for a wide range of diseases and conditions – from eczema and obsessive compulsive disorder to malaria, Parkinson’s disease and gout. The organisations running the trials talk about how this can be a great opportunity for students and others to earn cash while catching up on their studies or sleep, or sitting around playing games consoles and watching Netflix. But while the money will be tempting to some, many people will be wary – mainly because they would be worried about the risk of suffering an adverse reaction. The notorious “Elephant Man” drug trial at Northwick Park hospital in north-west London in 2006, which left six healthy men (who were each paid £2,000) fighting for their lives, continues to cast a long shadow over the sector. There are a number of companies and organisations that either conduct medical research themselves or recruit volunteers. They include MAC Clinical Research, HMR (Hammersmith Medicines Research), Quotient Sciences, Trials4us, which is part of Richmond Pharmacology, Labcorp, and Parexel – the firm that ran that disastrous 2006 trial. These six all advertise current and upcoming trials on their websites. Also, look out for the ads promoting FluCamp and others that often appear in newspapers. It varies hugely. King’s College London recently advertised in Metro for volunteers for a study relating to exercise that was offering £100 (plus travel costs and a free health check), which arguably doesn’t sound like a lot. However, many of the trials being advertised on the websites mentioned above are offering four-figure sums. Payments of £4,000 to £6,000-plus are not uncommon. FluCamp’s ads say it will pay people £4,200, and that an average trial lasts 11-14 days. In some cases you will get travel expenses on top; in others this is included in the payment. Some trials involve healthy volunteers; others are looking for people with a specific illness or condition. Usually there is a minimum and maximum age. Some trials only want men or women, and some don’t want people who currently smoke. Traditionally this is something that has been popular with students. A survey carried out last year by the website Save the Student indicated that 2% of students make money from drug trials. However, Quotient Sciences says its recent volunteers come “from all sorts of backgrounds – from firefighters and accountants to students, social workers, nurses and cabin crew”. Sometimes there are quite specific requirements. If you have previously dabbled with LSD or ecstasy, for example, HMR is currently seeking healthy men aged 18-55 who must have taken at least one hallucinogenic drug in the past. It is for a trial to test a potential new medicine for treating the symptoms of drug withdrawal, and the payment is £3,000. Meanwhile, MAC Clinical Research has a couple of trials looking for men experiencing erectile dysfunction (the payment is a little under £700), and one for people with OCD (£490). Again, this will vary hugely. Needless to say, the better-paying trials involve a lot more than having some blood tests and a physical examination. The trials involve a vast array of medicines and treatments. Some involve psychedelic drugs such as ibogaine, psilocybin and ayahuasca. In some cases, in addition to taking the study drug (or a placebo dummy medication), you might have to undergo a medical procedure. There may also be rules covering what you can eat, contraception and so on. And, yes, to get the big bucks you can expect a number of overnight stays. For example, HMR is advertising a trial for healthy men paying £5,000 to test a potential medicine for Parkinson’s disease that involves seven nights’ residence on its wards, six outpatient visits, two MRI scans and two lumbar punctures (where a thin needle is inserted between the bones in your lower spine). MAC Clinical Research is running a trial for healthy men and women to assess a potential new treatment for pain that pays up to £6,060, although receiving that sum involves an 18-night stay. The highest-paying trial we could find was one that Parexel is running soon for healthy men aged 28-55 to test a new medicine for osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones. The payment is £7,475, and participants will receive the drug as an injection given under the skin in the stomach. This trial involves one screening visit, two nights in the unit and 25 follow-up visits. The NHS says it is important for people considering doing a trial to find out about the inconvenience and risks involved before they sign up, and “carefully weigh up whether it’s worth it”. All over the country. MAC Clinical Research has clinics in Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside, south Staffordshire, South Yorkshire, Teesside and West Yorkshire. HMR has a big base in Park Royal, west London, while Trials4us is located in London Bridge, and Parexel is at Northwick Park hospital. The Quotient Sciences trials base is just outside Nottingham, while Labcorp has a clinic in Leeds. FluCamp has facilities in London and Manchester. This will vary depending on your circumstances. The payment could well count as “miscellaneous income” and you might be liable for income tax on it if the sum received is greater than your “reasonable costs” associated with taking part in the trial (which it often will be). But remember that everyone, including students, has a tax-free personal allowance – the amount of income you don’t have to pay income tax on. For 2022-23 this is £12,570. Also, you get a £1,000-a-year tax-free allowance for “trading income”, which includes money earned from side hustles or odd jobs such as clinical trials. If your annual income from these is more than £1,000, or if in any doubt, talk to HM Revenue and Customs. The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group website has a useful section on this area. If you are on benefits, speak to your benefit office or HMRC to find out what effect any payments might have. According to industry guidelines, payment amounts should not be related to the perceived risk. HMR says payment amounts are based on the length of the trials, adding: “It doesn’t change according to the type of study medicine. Payment is for your time and inconvenience and is never a reward for risk.” It is possible you will experience unexpected side-effects, according to the NHS. Of course, it is possible for any medication to cause side-effects. Trials4us says this may be the first time the trial medication has been given to humans, “so there may not be any direct knowledge of its side-effect profile”. But it adds that the risks involved will have been carefully assessed in animal studies using doses that greatly exceed those given to volunteers. In 2015 the Mirror published data released after a freedom of information request showing that 7,187 Britons who took part in clinical trials between 2010 and 2014 suffered serious and unexpected adverse reactions, of which 493 were immediately life-threatening. More recent data does not appear to be available. Meals and access to leisure facilities are typically included. HMR’s website talks about its “outstanding” facilities for volunteers including restaurant-standard meals, free wifi, widescreen TVs with Sky and games consoles, books, newspapers and board games. Similarly, Quotient Sciences says you can watch TV or DVDs, play on its Xboxes, read or surf the net and take part in pool tournaments. Some companies including FluCamp offer private en suite rooms but with many trials you will be on an open ward. Insurers are unlikely to ask about any participation in clinical trials, says the Association of British Insurers. “If they do, then, as with all questions, you should answer honestly and fully.” If in any doubt, check with your insurer. Before a trial of a new medicine can begin, a government agency called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has to review and authorise it. And all medical research involving people has to be approved by an independent research ethics committee. Yes, almost certainly. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has guidelines on this area. The compensation policy should be clearly spelled out at the outset. Check out the websites mentioned previously, plus press ads and noticeboards at GP practices, universities, etc. The Be Part of Research website has information about clinical trials, while many charity websites highlight trials. The NHS says you can ask your doctor or a patient organisation if they know of any that you may be eligible to join. To hear other people’s experiences of taking part in a clinical trial, visit healthtalk.org/clinical-trials/overview. A man in his 30s from Manchester told us he was paid £730 plus expenses to take part in a trial for a potential treatment for erectile dysfunction. He signed up after seeing an advert on Facebook from MAC Clinical Research. Asked what was involved, he said: “Health checks involving blood pressure, ECG, blood samples and repeat visits to the clinic. Some participants self-applied a RigiScan device in private, which was used to measure their erections.” He added: “While I would describe the trial as unusual, the MAC staff brought normality and care; they were all discreet, professional and very knowledgable. The RigiScan device was simple and easy to use. I felt at ease throughout the study.

4/16/2022,"They say not to work with babies or animals, but the photographer Gerrard Gethings chose to combine the two for his latest project, a series of portraits of young animals alongside their adult counterparts. Baby Animal Match was conceived as a memory card game, in which players are asked to pair duckling with duck, owlet with owl, hoglet with hedgehog, piglet and pig – and so on, through 44 combinations. These fluffy, tousled, bug-eyed babies are, inevitably, adorable. But not always in obvious ways. “There is a universal cuteness,” Gethings says. “But that wasn’t exactly what I was looking for. The baby racing pigeon, for example – that goes through an incredible transformation from an awful yellow hairy squab to a beautiful iridescent bird that can fly 100 miles an hour.” Gethings, who is based in London, grew up in Lancashire, and worked for the photographer Terry O’Neill for a decade before striking out on his own as one of Britain’s finest animal portrait photographers. Previous projects have included human subjects – such as 2018’s Do You Look Like Your Dog?, in which an Afghan hound needs to be matched to his windswept, long-haired owner – but increasingly Gethings finds himself gravitating towards animal-only work. “With animals, I feel in control, more fully present. They don’t understand language, but they understand body language and the way you are with them. With people there’s more going on, a subtext.” It took a little while to zoom in on exactly what makes baby animals so engaging, he tells me. “They’ve got to be really young, but not too young. Too young, and they can’t support themselves. They’re just a blob. There’s a sweet spot after a few days when they can stand up, open their eyes, show that first bit of life. It’s really fascinating.” Gethings captures his babies at the sweetest spots of all: a creamy lamb standing four-square, its spindly legs braced shakily against the ground; a donkey foal whose ears are entirely out of proportion to its dainty velveteen muzzle; a duckling dressed in primrose yellow fuzz, caught mid-quack. The quality of “universal cuteness” that Gethings alludes to is something that has been carefully studied. In the 1940s, the Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz – who became world famous for demonstrating that baby goslings would bond to and follow the first moving thing they saw, whether that be mother goose or Lorenz himself – outlined what he called the “Kindchenschema” (baby schema): a number of features common among babies of different species that elicit a positive response from humans. These included a large cranium and eyes; small nose and mouth; plump body and chubby, squeezable cheeks. It’s an appealing aesthetic. For species whose young are born needy and reliant on their parents, attracting kind and caring attention might make all the difference for survival. More recent research supports Lorenz’s belief that the appeal transfers across the species divide – that the same psychological mechanism is involved in spotting and appreciating the cuteness of babies, puppies and kittens alike. It’s an evolutionary explanation for why we find small, wet-eyed pups so appealing, and may be what drives us (and other animals) to care for the orphaned young of other species. Still, not all of Gethings’ baby animals fall into the straightforwardly adorable category: in one pairing, a swivel-eyed adult chameleon clings to a bare branch, tail tightly coiled and its back crenellated with a fine, teeth-like crest; its baby hatchling – though smaller and more delicate – also has an eerie, alien aspect. As does the bristling caterpillar, its etched-bronze body carefully illuminated against a black background, intricate as a museum piece. Even the downy white owl chick retains an air of menace, opening its beak to screech in complaint, eyes pressed shut with the effort of it, outsized talons outstretched. That was one of his favourite shoots, Gethings says. “You don’t get to handle owls every day. And barn owls in particular are so beautiful that to get the opportunity to photograph them was dreamy.” The proximity to the animals was one of his main motivations for the project, he says. “Getting to hold a baby hedgehog is reason enough to be there. The animals are, inevitably, cute. But I didn’t want to rely on that – the portraits had to stand up in their own right.” Unexpectedly, it was the donkeys that caused most issues. “They’ve been portrayed as docile and cute, but in reality they were quite wild.” While shooting a jenny and her foal, Gethings spotted a male donkey watching nearby and suggested they let him in. Big mistake. “He came charging in, making a horrific sound and jumped on the female donkey. He really wanted to make some more baby donkeys. We were in a confined space and couldn’t get him out, it was terrifying! Amorous donkeys – there’s no stopping them.” Gethings’ portraits act as a clear visual shorthand for how we all grow and change – whether man or mouse, horse or hedgehog. Those liquid, puppy-dog eyes are soon outgrown, the teacup piglet on its tiny trotters will morph into a whiskered, squinting sow. Such is life; age comes for us all. I just wish that, like the squab, my own trajectory was to grow only more beautiful with the years.

4/16/2022,"‘New Challenge, New Life, Same Passion,” wrote Saïd Aïgoun on Instagram when he was unveiled as Crystal Palace’s new development coach in July. Now firmly established as an integral part of Patrick Vieira’s backroom staff, the former educational adviser at a Parisian school who is described by those who have worked with him as a “tactical genius” may not be a household name even among Palace supporters. But after a season in which his compatriot has transformed the south London club’s style of play since taking over from Roy Hodgson last summer, the unassuming 38-year-old has also been credited with playing a major role in Palace’s renaissance as they prepare to face Chelsea in Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final. “I don’t know if English fans really know the quality of Saïd Aïgoun,” says Salim Baungally, a host on the French TV channel RMC who worked with Aïgoun when he was a regular pundit for their Premier League coverage. “He is a tactical genius who never stops watching games! As a pundit, he was very interesting because he would highlight many things that even former players didn’t see.” Having started out as coach of Paris FC, where he helped develop the future Manchester City signings Olivier Ntcham and Seko Fofana, Aïgoun also worked at Auxerre and Paris Saint-Germain’s academy before receiving a call from Vieira at the start of last year. Both were unemployed at the time but it was agreed that Aïgoun would be part of the 1998 World Cup winner’s staff whenever his next opportunity came. A close friend of Emmanuel Petit – Vieira’s old midfield partner for club and country – after sharing a TV studio with the former Arsenal and Chelsea player, Aïgoun has proved to be a shrewd appointment. The average age of a squad that was the oldest in the Premier League last season under Hodgson has been reduced significantly thanks to some astute acquisitions by the sporting director, Dougie Freedman, while Vieira has introduced an attacking gameplan that is unrecognisable from his predecessor’s safety-first approach. “The difference is amazing,” says Baungally. “Of course, Patrick is the manager and deserves so much credit but I’m sure that Saïd has played an important role. He enjoys working with young players like Michael Olise, Marc Guéhi and Eberechi Eze – he loves that. I think it’s important for him to have time to integrate his methods and it’s much easier with young players. You can’t do that with more experienced players who are in their 30s.” At the last count, only six other English clubs – Arsenal, Brentford, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester United and Wolves – employ a dedicated development coach who is tasked with helping young players to integrate into the first team. “I will have a particular focus on the development of professional players, and I will also ensure the transition from the academy to our professional team,” explained Aïgoun on his appointment. “It’s a role that is close to my heart in view of my career and which is very important for Patrick Vieira, who has proven everywhere he has been that he is able to launch young players and make them play well.” After the opening of the club’s new £20m academy by Gareth Southgate in October, Guéhi’s and Tyrick Mitchell’s first senior call-ups from the England manager for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast in March provided further recognition for Palace’s new approach. Yet according to Mathieu Faurie, who is RMC’s Premier League reporter, that is not all Aïgoun deserves credit for. “Saïd has had a lot of attention for working with youth players but he also specialises in tactics and analysing opponents,” says Faurie. “He really looks at the opponent and helps the team adapt to how they are going to play according to his plan. Saïd plays a very important role – he was telling me he has been working seven days a week and never really stops. “He’s a very calm and quiet guy who prefers to be in the background normally. But on TV, he always wanted to explain and analyse the game in a simple and clear way. When Patrick Vieira asked him to make his first speech in front of the team, he told us he was excited but nervous – he’s not the type of person who puts his personality on the frontline.” With Aïgoun, Vieira and now Olise – called up by France Under-21s in the last international break – such is Palace’s popularity across the Channel these days that they have become a regular choice for RMC’s live coverage. “This season we are really interested in them because of Vieira,” says Baungally. “And people want to watch Palace because they are playing some very good football.” Faurie adds: “There was a kind of hype about them at the start of the season because of Vieira and his status in France. People were really interested to see what he could do, particularly because he was sacked by Nice in December 2020, and I think they have been surprised that he has succeeded in such a big league and with a less well-known club.” Gaining revenge over Chelsea after losing 3-0 to Thomas Tuchel’s side in his first game in charge in August would certainly be the icing on the cake for Vieira and the Palace chairman, Steve Parish. As for Aïgoun’s own managerial ambitions, however, it appears Vieira’s job is safe for now. “Maybe in five years or so he will become a manager but for now I know that his focus is on being an assistant,” says Baungally. “Saïd has a very good reputation with sporting directors everywhere.”",Sport/Football,Saïd Aïgoun: the ‘tactical genius’ helping Vieira revamp Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/said-aigoun-the-tactical-genius-helping-vieira-revamp-crystal-palace
4/16/2022,"Whatever your standpoint on whether the pandemic is over, or what “living with the virus” should mean, it is clear some manifestation of Covid-19 will be with us for some time to come. Not least for the estimated 1.7 million people in the UK living with long Covid. And lest any who made a full and rapid recovery from infection still wonder whether long Covid might be a self-reported creation of the indolent, this is a now a large, well-documented, convergent cluster of clear physiological symptoms, and it is common to every part of the globe affected by Covid-19. Many sufferers of my acquaintance were keen cyclists, runners, skiers and dancers, but are now disabled and deprived of their former passions, while some are unable to resume their former professions. Doctors and scientists the world over now consider this a recognised part of the Sars-CoV-2 symptom profile. Many of the most severe and enduring “long-haulers” derive from the first UK infection wave just before the initial lockdown in March 2020. Even though it was clear from the outset that the risk of long Covid was not correlated simply with the severity of infection, there was every reason to hope that with the large-scale rollout of effective vaccines, and more recent waves of infection dominated by a somewhat less severe variant, there would be few additions to the sufferers joining long Covid support groups. We thought that the number of long Covid cases developing might be lower when most cases were breakthrough cases in the vaccinated, or infections in vaccinated or partially vaccinated children. Sadly, far from any subsidence in new long Covid cases, the big, ongoing caseloads of the Delta, Omicron and BA.2 waves have brought a large cohort of new sufferers. From published data, the chances of long Covid in those who are vaccinated but suffer breakthrough infections may be halved, but when you apply this to the huge waves we’ve experienced – 3.5 million people infected at a given time – each 3.5 million cases becomes another 175,000 people with long Covid. These waves have disproportionately affected primary and secondary schools, and many of the new sufferers are children. Sammie Mcfarland at LongCovidKids.org reports a constant stream of new members across its support services, many developing long Covid after two, three or four bouts of reinfection, having escaped it first time round. Also, the symptom spectrum may be shifting from the earlier waves, with more reports of sight, hearing and motor-function deficits, alongside gastrointestinal pain, joint pain, rashes, swelling and fatigue. This is a tangible price being paid for turning a blind eye to the high incidence of cases in schools over recent months. With such large numbers having been infected at any given time in recent months, many suffering repeat infections at three- or four-week intervals, the potential legacy of chronic, disabling illness is an aspect making this utterly different from most other winter respiratory pathogens – such as flu or colds. Nobody is certain whether long Covid from the current period will be quite the same as the early waves, but this is an experiment that none of us would wish to do on our children. It has been consistently difficult to assess the trajectory of people’s recovery from persistent symptoms, which has entailed assessing those whose symptoms lasted three months but not six, compared with the smaller subset without improvement at 18-24 months. A team at the University of Toronto followed up patients with persistent symptoms after infection during the 2003 Sars outbreak. Many of these showed little recovery several years later. If this trend were extrapolated to our current Omicron wave, the effects on education, the workforce and healthcare provision would be huge. It is still early days for long Covid research. The UK’s strength in epidemiology research through survey data, such as the Office for National Statistics, React2 and ZOE, put us at the forefront of counting and recognising the importance of long Covid, leading to the early push for dedicated clinics. This was important, but sufferers have understandably become weary of questionnaires and surveys, looking for tangible progress on mechanisms and therapeutic trials – the demand for less observation, more intervention. In the early days of long Covid, we and others put forward working hypotheses to explain the disease process. These spanned the effects of the virus itself causing enduring damage and scarring in diverse body organs, viral persistence, autoimmunity causing a range of symptoms, and many more. Relatively small-scale studies have produced some interesting support for each of these, but we still lack the overarching paradigm – or way of understanding the disease – that would facilitate comprehensive diagnostic testing, bespoke care pathways and curative therapeutics. People with long Covid led the charge to identify, characterise and trigger a research agenda for the new condition through hard work and proactive social media networks. Their attention (and wrath) is now focused on impatience to test potential treatments. There is pressure – sometimes manifest as patients travelling abroad for costly experimental treatments – to trial everything from antivirals and anti-spike monoclonal antibodies to anticoagulants and apheresis (a complex procedure to remove possible microclots from blood). As was appreciated from the results of randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) for original Covid-19 treatments, sometimes approaches that have been heavily publicised do not pan out, while others are convincingly shown to work and change global management of patients’ symptoms – such as the drugs tocilizumab and dexamethasone. Long Covid sufferers need a large-scale recovery trial, fast-tracked to offer them some answers about treatments. Many of the responses offered when they get to the front of the queue at long Covid clinics are about readjustment and rehabilitation in light of their new disability. They do not want readjustment, they want their lives back. Some current research programmes offer initial steps in this direction. The Stimulate-ICP trial at University College hospital will compare effectiveness of antihistamines, rivaroxaban (an anti-clotting drug) and colchicine (an anti-inflammatory). A clinical trial at Oxford University is investigating whether a drug called AXA1125 can treat fatigue and muscle weakness. Our thinking about Sars-CoV-2 and long Covid – and our response to it – has had to shift and readjust, virtually on a monthly basis. This is now a highly infectious, upper-respiratory virus able to reinfect repeatedly – an outcome that wasn’t expected early in the pandemic. If we renege on mitigations as each round of infection draws more of all ages into chronic disability, this may be the blunder that we rue for decades to come. Even after the original wave of lockdowns and deaths has become a distantly remembered nightmare. Danny Altmann is a professor of immunology at Imperial College London.

4/16/2022,"Priti Patel could face a Home Office mutiny over plans to process migrants 5,000 miles away in Rwanda after overruling officials to push through the scheme. The home secretary issued a rare ministerial direction to overrule concerns of civil servants about whether the scheme would deliver value for money. It is only the second ministerial direction – an order enforced by a minister despite objection from a permanent secretary – the Home Office has received in 30 years. The first was to speed up the Windrush compensation scheme before legislation. Civil servants could stage mass walk-outs in protest against the new plans, unions have warned. Britain has promised Rwanda an initial £120m as part of an “economic transformation and integration fund”, but the UK will be paying for operational costs too. A set amount of funding will be allocated for each migrant, expected to cost between £20,000 and £30,000 per person for the flight to Rwanda, and the first three months of accommodation there. The immigration minister, Tom Pursglove, said on Friday he believed the move would save Britain money in the longer term. However, civil servants are against the policy on legal and ethical grounds, and are expected to express their distaste over the direction. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA trade union, warned officials could demand a transfer from the Home Office or leave the civil service entirely rather than deliver the policy. He said: “It’s a divisive policy but civil servants know that their job is to serve the government of the day. On the most divisive policies, civil servants’ choice is to implement them or leave. That could mean elsewhere in the department, another department or leaving the civil service. ” The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said that “to attempt to claim this is anything other than utterly inhumane is sheer hypocrisy”. Peers, human rights lawyers and members of the opposition have also condemned the scheme – even claiming it is unlikely to happen due to judicial reviews and other court actions set to challenge the legality of the measures. The shadow prisons minister, Ellie Reeves, told Times Radio: “The UNHCR [UN refugee agency] have come out really, really strongly condemning the government’s proposals, as have many organisations, and it seems the government’s own civil servants have expressed huge misgivings about the plans, which seem to be completely misguided.” She said: “We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis, so it doesn’t seem the right way to be spending money on an unethical and unworkable scheme that won’t deter people from coming over.” On Friday, the UNHCR condemned the plan as “a symbolic gesture” that would be unworkable in practice. Despite the backlash, Patel believes other countries will follow the UK’s asylum proposals. She said Denmark could be among those to reproduce the UK’s “blueprint” system. “There is no question now that the model we have put forward, I’m convinced is world class and a world first, and it will be used as a blueprint going forward, there’s no doubt about that,” Patel said. “I would not be surprised if other countries start coming to us direct on the back of this as well.”",News/Politics,Priti Patel could face Home Office mutiny over Rwanda asylum plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/16/priti-patel-home-office-mutiny-rwanda-asylum-plan
4/16/2022,"Sting opens his set with Russians, a 1985 single about the cold war that he has reworked and reissued to raise funds for a Ukraine relief charity. “I’ve hardly played it in years, because I thought it wasn’t relevant any more,” he sighs. “But, in light of recent events …” Accompanied only by a Ukrainian cellist, Yaroslava Trofymchuk, the black-pleather-clad 70-year-old croons the song’s chorus and earnest central message: “Russians love their children too.” He cautions us: “Don’t forget, a lot of brave Russians are protesting against this war.” It could be mawkish, but Sting carries it off through his evident sincerity and, primarily, its haunting melody, pulled in part from Prokofiev. It is a potent start to the veteran star’s six-night London Palladium residency as part of a Covid-delayed world tour he is simply billing as My Songs. Sting has always been a divisive figure. Ever since his faux-punk days in the Police he has been a consummate musical craftsman, cleverly weaving trace elements of rock, jazz, reggae and global music styles into punchy pop tunes. The problem? It is all too evident how good he knows he is. The slickness with which Sting dispenses Police heavyweights Message in a Bottle and Every Little Thing She Does is Magic early in the set topples so easily into smugness. He is prone to distilling these sharp-edged songs, with hooks to hang your hat on, into freeform jazz. New songs If It’s Love and Rushing Water, from his lockdown album The Bridge, are exquisitely honed exercises in classy, adult rock that long for us to take them as seriously as they take themselves. Sting sporadically glances up from between his cheekbones, to check we appreciate how clever he is being. There is noodling aplenty. The sprung rhythms of Walking on the Moon segue into Bob Marley’s Get Up Stand Up and Sting looks very, very white. Roxanne remains a masterclass in sublime pop alchemy but cannot emerge unscathed from a bout of sub-Cleo Laine scat-singing. The sleek menace of Every Breath You Take still resonates 40 years on and, as a composer of infectious pop nuggets, Sting is near-peerless.
