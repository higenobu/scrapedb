3/18/2022,"A Russian oligarch’s superyacht is stranded in a Norwegian port after local oil suppliers refused to refuel it because of the owner’s ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, owner of the 223-foot yacht called Ragnar, is a former KGB agent and a longtime associate of Putin who made his millions in nickel mining. He also served as Russia’s deputy minister of economy, according to The New York Times. Strzhalkovsky is not currently on the E.U.’s list of oligarchs sanctioned as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but locals in the northern Norway port city of Narvik said they’re taking their own measures. “Why should we help them?” Sven Holmlund, an oil supplier, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. “They can row home. Or use a sail.” Norwegian politicians have urged confiscation of the custom-built vessel, but a government official told NRK the law prevents such action without an E.U. directive. The yacht’s captain, meanwhile, has decried his predicament, insisting the crew is “Western” and blameless in Russia’s war. “We find the discrimination towards us extremely unjust,” the captain, Robert Lankester, wrote in a message shared by NRK and NPR. The Ragnar’s stranding comes as the U.S government on Wednesday announced its own effort to “seize and freeze” the assets of Russian elites allied with Putin. The Treasury Department’s partial list of 50 individuals sanctioned by the U.S. and other jurisdictions does not include Strzhalkovsky’s name. The Ragnar flies the flag of the Yacht Club of Monaco, which hails the vessel as “a superyacht like no other.” It features an icebreaker hull and is outfitted for polar exploration. Other amenities include a helideck, swimming pool, gym, “a BigBo amphibious ATV, heli-skiing equipment, four See-Doos, four ski scooters, six Seabobs, a multipurpose island and a giant slide,” the magazine Boat International reported in a 2020 feature article. Strzhalkovsky reportedly received a golden parachute payout of $100 million in 2012 when he stepped down as CEO of the Norilsk Nickel mining company after four years. At the time, the severance was the largest ever awarded in Russia. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/18/2022,"By Sarah Wu and Yimou Lee DONGYIN, Taiwan/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan held live fire drills in its northernmost territory on Wednesday, putting the spotlight on a remote island that is strategically located at a chokepoint near China - and potentially vulnerable to attack. Although the defence ministry says the exercises on Dongyin, part of the Taiwan-controlled Matsu archipelago off the coast of China's Fuzhou, are routine, they are happening as Taipei has raised its alert level after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, wary of Beijing making a similar move. Soldiers fired shells at a floating red cross in the water, meant to represent advancing enemy forces. Piercing the calm blue sea, each shell sent spray upwards. The echoes of machine guns, punctuated by cannon fire, reverberated around the rugged coastline. Although Taiwan has not reported any unusual activities by Beijing since the Ukraine war began, on Feb. 5 a small, propeller-driven Chinese aircraft flew very close to Dongyin. The highly unusual event thrust the normally sleepy islet into the headlines. Taiwan said they suspected China was deploying a civilian aircraft to test the responses of its military. Taiwan does not publish details of its military presence there, but the Dongyin Area Command has been at the front line of Taiwan's defences since the 1950s. Chieh Chung, researcher at the National Policy Foundation, a Taipei-based think tank, said Dongyin's forces are equipped with Taiwan's self-made Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missile as well as Sky Bow II surface-to-air missiles, making it ""the most strategically important"" outlying island. Rocky Dongyin, reached by overnight boat from northern Taiwan's Keelung port and home to some 1,500 civilians, sits on an important passage for any southbound Chinese forces from the eastern province of Zhejiang if they attack Taiwan. ""That's why Dongyin is equipped with the Hsiung Feng and Sky Bow missiles. Dongyin poses a very direct threat to the Chinese Communist's air and naval movements,"" Chieh said. At a February seminar in Taipei simulating a Chinese attack on Taiwan, retired Navy Rear Admiral Tan Chih-lung said Dongyin's missile sites would be among the first targets of a Chinese attack. ""The People's Liberation Army for sure will go destroy the Hsiung Feng missile base in Dongyin,"" he said. ""It's a must-attack."" A security official familiar with the deployment in Dongyin put the number of the troops there at around 1,100. ""The missile base there is at the very front lines to counter any attack with our missiles. If not for that, why would we value such a small place where the port is too small for bigger military ships and where there's no airport for the air force?"" said the official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. A second security source acknowledged that the Chinese aircraft that got close to Dongyin had highlighted its vulnerability and proved it was of great interest to China. ""It's the key to control of the northern part of the Taiwan Strait,"" the source added. SOUNDS OF GUNFIRE Taiwan has governed Matsu, and Kinmen to its south, since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taipei at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Despite the presence of troops, Dongyin is not a closed island. Tourists can explore former military tunnels, take in the stark natural beauty and go fishing. ""We're very used to these sounds,"" said Dongyin township chief Lin Te-chien, as he observed Wednesday's drills. Taiwan does not have anywhere near the number of forces on Matsu and Kinmen as it did from the 1950s to late 1970s, when both island groups were regularly shelled by China. But Matsu and Kinmen continue to preoccupy Taiwan's strategists, who have been given new focus by the war in Ukraine. Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told lawmakers this month that China could draw lessons from the war in Ukraine and ""speed up"" their pace of any assault on Taiwan, perhaps attacking the outlying islands and at the same time starting precision missile strikes on targets in Taiwan, while sending troops across the strait. China now has the capacity to take Kinmen and other outlying islands, Chiu said. ""But why have they not done it?"" he asked. ""Because they want to make sure that they can settle everything with one strike."" (Reporting by Sarah Wu and Yimou Lee; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in Taipei.

3/18/2022,"A satellite image shows Russian helicopters destroyed at Ukraine's Kherson International Airport. Ukraine's military said the attack happened Tuesday. It is not clear how many helicopters were hit. Ukraine said earlier this month that it destroyed 30 Russian helicopters in a different attack. A satellite image shows destroyed Russian helicopters at a Ukrainian airport after an overnight attack. The image, taken on Wednesday by a Maxar Technologies satellite, shows the aftermath of a Tuesday strike by Ukrainian forces at Kherson International Airport in the south of the country. Ukraine's military said it hit the airport on Tuesday. It is not clear what kind of weaponry was used in the attack, or how many helicopters were destroyed. CNN reported on Tuesday that at least three Russian military helicopters were destroyed. There is no indication of whether there were any casualties in the attack. Ukraine previously said that it destroyed 30 Russian helicopters on a Kherson airfield on March 7. Russia captured the city of Kherson on March 2. It was the first major Ukrainian city to be seized by Russia in its invasion, which it started on February 24.

3/18/2022,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is flexing his diplomatic muscles in a nine-minute video uploaded to Twitter in which the action star and former Governor of California implores Russian soldiers to avoid becoming like his father, a Nazi solider who regretted his involvement in World War II. Schwarzenegger begins his message by tracing his love of Russia and the Russian people to Olympic weightlifter Yuri Petrovich Vlasov, the man who inspired him to pick up weights in the first place. He goes on to recall visiting Russia as an adult, meeting fans, and filming 1988's Red Heat in Moscow, the first American movie allowed to shoot in Red Square. Rolf Konow/Sygma/Getty ""Ever since I was 14 years old, I've had nothing but affection and respect for the people of Russia,"" Schwarzenegger says. ""The strength and the heart of the Russian people have always inspired me. That is why I hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in Ukraine and what is happening there."" While the global community has been outraged by Vladimir Putin's unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its third week, the people of Russia have largely been fed propaganda regarding the attacks. Schwarzenneger invokes the memory of his father, Gustav Schwarzenegger, a Nazi sergeant in Austria's army during the Second World War, and the lies he was told to justify the abominations he went on to perform. ""When my father arrived in Leningrad, he was all pumped up on the lies of his government,"" Schwarzenegger says. ""When he left Leningrad, he was broken — physically and mentally. He lived the rest of his life in pain — pain from a broken back, pain from the shrapnel that always reminded him of those terrible years and pain from the guilt that he felt. To the Russian soldiers listening to this broadcast: You already know much of the truth that I'm speaking. You've seen it in your own eyes. I don't want you to be broken like my father."" I love the Russian people. That is why I have to tell you the truth. Please watch and share. pic.twitter.com/6gyVRhgpFV — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) March 17, 2022 The truth about Schwarzenegger's father and his time as a Nazi became public in the late-80s, following the death of the elder Schwarzenegger in 1972, and was brought up again during the actor's run for governor in 2003, and again in 2020 following Schwarzenegger's criticisms of those not heeding COVID restrictions. This time, however, Schwarzenegger hoped to use his father's gruesome ties to break through the lies being fed to Russian soliders and civilians alike. ""I know that your government has told you that this is a war to denazify Ukraine,"" Schwarzenegger says, referencing the Russian president's various justifications for his war, and citing the 141 nations who have condemned his actions in Ukraine. Schwarzenegger then urges the Russian people and the Russian soldiers in Ukraine ""to understand the propaganda and the disinformation that you are being told."" He also acknowledges that not everyone in Russia has bought into the Kremlin's alternative facts, praising the protestors who have taken to the streets and in at least one case, the airways, to denounce the war. ""We know that you've suffered the consequences of your courage. You have been arrested, you've been jailed, and you've been beaten,"" Schwarzenegger says. ""You are my new heroes. You have the strength of Yuri Petrovich Vlasov. You have the true heart of Russia.""
