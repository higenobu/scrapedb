2/18/2022,"When a veteran beach clean-up expert noticed a bloom of yellow plastic tubing along Outer Cape strands, she began to ask questions. ""I had never seen it before,"" said Laura Ludwig, manager of the Center for Coastal Studies Marine Debris and Plastics Program. ""Where was it coming from?"" Thus began a journey to unravel the stringy mystery. Ludwig first encountered the tubing in September 2021 at Long Point in Provincetown during a beach clean-up. During the days that followed, more of the plastic was picked off beaches in Outer Cape towns. ""It was mind-blowing how much of the stuff there was,"" she said in a recent phone interview. The yellow tubing has a thin rope-like appearance, and continues to wash up on Cape Cod beaches in varying lengths, from very short (1 millimeter) to 90 feet. Ludwig said it has been found on beaches in Provincetown, Truro, Wellfleet, Orleans, Brewster and Yarmouth. It has also been found on beaches in Hull, Scituate and beyond. ""I found a piece in Newport, Rhode Island last week,"" said Ludwig. So far, Ludwig's beach cleanups and other volunteer efforts have plucked more than 2,000 feet of the tubing from Cape beaches. Picking up beach debris is no easy task, but determining where it came from can also be a tall order. Because of its sudden appearance, Ludwig figured the tubing must have been related to a new situation, perhaps a recent project or unusual occurrence. She reached out to beach debris colleagues, asking for assistance on the mystery. One of those colleagues posted a picture of the tubing on Facebook. According to Ludwig, someone from the United Kingdom said it looked similar to material used in blasting rocks in quarries. This explosive theory led Ludwig to reach out to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to see if similar tubing had been used in projects in the region. The answer, according to Ludwig was ""yes."" The tubing on the beaches came from a Boston Harbor dredging project that began in June 2021 and concluded in January 2022. Known as explosive shock tubing, the yellow plastic strand is used to transmit a signal to explosives. In this case, the explosives were underwater, placed to break up rocks as the harbor channel was deepened. According to Ludwig, the contractor involved with the project did have a containment strategy, with vessels on the surface picking up the tubing as it floated to the surface, but some escaped, likely mixed in with rocky debris. Photo gallery: Sandwich Boardwalk damaged by storm Ludwig said both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the contractor are seeking ways to improve containment on future projects. To deal with the current situation, Ludwig is organizing a beach clean-up along the Boston Harbor shoreline in collaboration with the Corps and the contractor. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not immediately respond to a phone message and email seeking comment about the debris. According to a press release from the Center for Coastal Studies, ""the shock tube is made out of low‐density polyethylene (the same plastic used to make grocery bags) and is considered safe for humans to touch. But many of the pieces are small enough for birds or other animals to eat and can create health problems if ingested."" PFAS in lobsters? Another sign these harmful compounds are everywhere, researchers say Cape Cod beachcombers may recall a somewhat similar situation in 2011, when a New Hampshire wastewater treatment plant accidentally released millions of small plastic discs, with many ending up on area beaches. Ludwig said she still finds those disks along Cape beaches. Ludwig is working with oceanographers at the Center for Coastal Studies and NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Woods Hole on drift models that may help predict where the tubing will come ashore. She is also asking for help from people who find the tubing on the beach. Reports of shock tube location and length can be emailed to Ludwig at lludwig@coastalstudies.org. 'Things are worse': Cape Cod water quality is declining, says environmental group's report Over the years, Ludwig has become more concerned over the amount of plastic in our region's waters and on the beaches. ""These are things that never go away,"" she said. ""We find plastic lobster trap tags from the 1990s.""

2/18/2022,"Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt appeared on Special Report With Bret Baier Thursday, where he spoke about new filings by Special Counsel John Durham concerning possible wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Though, so far, the filings center mostly around Michael Sussman, a lawyer associated with the campaign, many on Fox News and other conservative media outlets have taken this opportunity to point the finger at Clinton herself, and have spent a lot of time doing so. “I agree that the media has made too much of this filing. I think I said two nights ago, we don’t know anything yet because Sussman can either go John Dean or he can go Gordon Liddy,” Hewitt said, referencing Watergate. He continued, “But I noted that John Durham said there will be motions in limine coming. And Harold (Ford Jr.) and I did go to Michigan Law School and we both know one thing from our time there, from great law professors, nobody knows nothing about what the prosecution has until the prosecution rolls out its indictment.” Speaking at the New York state Democratic convention Thursday, Clinton hit back at Fox News, even alluding to what could be possible grounds for a lawsuit. “Fox leads the charge with accusations against me, counting on their audience to fall for it again,” Clinton said. “And as an aside, they’re getting awfully close to actual malice in their attacks.” In response to Clinton’s remark, Fox opinion host Sean Hannity said, “Bring it on.” But Clinton has a point. There has been a lot said and printed about her concerning things that don’t actually show up in Durham’s filings. Alan Dershowitz, who has been a frequent guest on Fox, told Newsmax that he hasn’t seen anything that points directly to Clinton. He also said that the only indictments so far add up to process crimes instead of “substantive indictments.” It remains to be seen what else Durham may uncover. Special Report With Bret Baier airs weekdays at 6 p.m. on Fox News Channel. Check out what the Black teen from the mall fight that went viral said about the cops who broke it up: 'Treating him like he was superior to me': On Don Lemon Tonight Wednesday, 14-year-old Kye and his mother Eboné appeared to speak about the fight Kye got into at a New Jersey mall on Saturday. Video of the fight between Kye and the older, bigger white teen went viral because when officers arrived to break it up, the white kid was escorted to a couch while Kye, who is Black, was tackled and cuffed while both officers each had a knee pressed into his back. At one point, the other kid stood up from the couch and stood over Kye, looking down at him as he was being cuffed.
“I kind of felt like the cops were going along with what the older kid was saying about him being bigger and stronger and superior. I felt like they were agreeing to it,” Kye said. “I felt like they were treating him like he was superior to me, and agreeing with the fact that he knew he was superior. Or that he thought he was superior.”
The viral video understandably has people outraged by the actions of the officers. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said he was “deeply disturbed” by it. Eboné believes that what happened unfortunately was due to race.
“I hate to say this, but if it wasn't for race, then what is it?” Eboné asked. “What made them tackle my son and not the other kid? What made them be so aggressive with my son and not the other kid? Why is the other kid sitting down looking at my son be humiliated and put into cuffs? It just doesn't make sense. It makes me angry.” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: Robert Pattinson was 'absolutely terrified' to release 'The Batman' Queen Elizabeth cracked a joke about Daniel Craig curing his last visit LeVar Burton implores kids to read banned books: 'That's where the good stuff is' Tell us what you think!
