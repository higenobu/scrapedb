3/18/2022,"The last time South Australians went to the polls to vote in a new government, the state had become a battlefield in a bitter national debate on the climate crisis. A violent storm in 2016 had whipped up two tornadoes – unheard of in that part of the world – and sent them barrelling down the centre of the continent, ripping through transmission lines and plunging the state into darkness. In the aftermath South Australians became collateral damage in a national culture war over the climate crisis, renewable energy and how best to respond to an increasingly volatile environment. Federal politicians seized on the statewide blackout to claim renewable energy was unstable and unreliable, while billionaires Elon Musk and Mike Cannon-Brookes famously arranged a bet over social media about the direction of the state’s power grid. Against this backdrop, the need to transition to a zero carbon economy sparked fierce competition between the two major parties at the 2018 election – a sclerotic Labor administration that had been in power for 16 years and a Liberal opposition sensing blood. Four years later, as South Australians go back to the polling booth this Saturday, the major parties have been relatively quiet on the climate crisis and environmental issues. With the power grid stabilised and the proportion of the state’s energy needs provided by renewables growing from zero to 60% in 14 years, it is no longer the contentious issue it once was. Residents of Kangaroo Island and the Adelaide Hills are yet to fully recover from the Black Summer Bushfires and headlines from the catastrophic floods in New South Wales and Queensland have dominated during the campaign, but the climate crisis has largely taken a back seat as debate focuses on a crisis in the health system. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Patrick O’Connor, the president of the Nature Conservation Society, says this should be a concern to voters as the time available to act is shrinking, with scientists warning deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are needed by 2030. “The next government will finish its term halfway through that decade. Any government going into an election with nothing to say is very significant,” O’Connor says. “So far the Liberal government has had nothing to say. If I otherwise liked something about the Liberal Party agenda, what would I be voting for in the next four years on climate change and biodiversity? I don’t know.” Even with bipartisan support for the transition to renewable energy and the state having a head start on other jurisdictions, South Australia is not without its problems. Emissions from power generation are falling, but according to the Department for Environment and Water those from road transport are growing fast. They are now the biggest source of emissions in the state. While this might be considered fertile ground for new policy proposals on freight, public transport, cycling and electric vehicles, the response from the incumbent Liberals has been “business as usual” on environmental issues – consistent with the party’s broader budget-conscious and austerity-minded campaign. On electric vehicles, for example, the Liberal government introduced an incentive scheme to encourage uptake that included a $3,000 subsidy program. These incentives were welcomed by industry, but they were not as generous as New South Wales’ program, as they also introduced an EV user charge that discourages people from making a switch. The government is instead relying on its environmental record. It promises to continue work on the expansion of port infrastructure at Port Bonython on the Eyre Peninsula to facilitate hydrogen exports, as well as engaging in early talks to convert the Nyrstar lead refinery at Port Pirie to renewable energy and agricultural projects around carbon farming and lowering methane emissions. Speaking to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, David Spiers, says the Liberal government’s approach to the climate crisis had prioritised building the infrastructure needed for private industry to do the heavy lifting on the transition. “We will be continuing our trajectory around what I think is a really strong platform that we put in place with our climate action plan,” Spiers says. “We’ve had a plan out there for the best part of the year. It will be business as usual but not in a way where there is low ambition. “[We will be] transitioning our economy, getting everything in place, and focusing on two or three areas, agriculture, transportation, hydrogen and carbon and sequestration and storage.” The refusal to expand on what the party would do if returned to government has environment groups in South Australia concerned. In the lead up to the election, the South Australian Conservation Council – a coalition of groups with more than 100,000 members – issued a survey to both major parties, the Greens and SA Best. The Liberal Party, however, refused to participate, responding instead with a statement highlighting past achievements. Spiers, known for colourful attacks on political opponents, says the party did not participate because he believed the survey was “stacked against us” and describes its organisers as “a bit of a joke”. The chief executive of the Conservation Council SA, Craig Wilkins, stands by the scorecard, its methodology and the responses which are published on its website. “It was a near identical process in 2018, when the Liberal Party was in opposition and eager to get our support. They were quite happy to follow through and provide comments at the time,” Wilkins says. Wilkins says the creation of Australia’s largest national park in the Munga-Thirri-Simpson desert was “the most important environmental outcome” from the Marshall government during its term but “no party can be allowed to coast and sit on their laurels”. Against this backdrop the Labor opposition has sought to distinguish itself by putting a new $593m government-owned 200MW green hydrogen power plant at the centre of its election pitch. Labor’s deputy leader, Susan Close, says under current plans the project would be built near Whyalla to support nearby industrial operations, including the local steelworks, but could be opened up to later export clean energy. “Our view is if we’re going to continue to have manufacturing in Australia it’s going to have to go green quickly. This is our contribution to that,” Close says. The proposal was dismissed by the Liberal Party, which says the cost of construction was likely to blow out to $1.2b, while Whyalla locals have raised concerns over whether it will interfere with the migration of giant cuttlefish in the Upper Spencer Gulf. “There will be no trouble for the cuttlefish,” Close said. “We would never do that.” Environmental groups however have raised concerns after Labor announced on Wednesday it would fund its other election commitments by introducing an “efficiency dividend” of 1.7% across government departments including health, education, police, child protection, Tafe, courts and emergency services in order to offset the cost of its election commitments. Wilkins said the last-minute announcement would cut $34m in “core funding” from the Department of Environment and Water and called for the Department of Environment and Water to be “quarantined” from the cuts.On other issues both Labor and the Greens say they would support a range of changes if in a position to decide policy after Saturday. They include an expansion of schemes to support solar and battery systems in low-income households, a world heritage application for the Great Australian Bight and the introduction of a state biodiversity act. A looming issue that will carry over, and is likely to remain vexed whatever the election result, is the construction of a federal nuclear waste dump at Kimba on the Eyre peninsula. Labor, the Greens and independents all oppose the dump. Wilkins says the federal government has just assumed “they’ll just be able to roll it out and somehow South Australians will accept it and everyone will move on”, but that may not the case, and the election could throw its future into doubt. “This facility is supposed to be there for nearly 100 years,” Wilkins said. “That raises big questions, I would have thought.”",News/Australia news,Environmental policies are taking a back seat in the SA election.

3/18/2022,"Russia is being forced to divert “large numbers” of troops to defend its supply lines rather than continuing its attacks in Ukraine, British defence intelligence analysts believe. The UK Ministry of Defence’s latest intelligence report says logistical problems continue to beset Russia’s troops. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest address: “The occupants thought they were going to Ukraine which they had seen before, in 2014-2015, which they corrupted and were not afraid of, but we are different now.” About 130 people have been rescued so far from the basement of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, officials said. Hundreds of people were hiding beneath the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, when it was struck on Wednesday. Serhiy Taruta, a former governor of the Donetsk region, said rescue efforts had been hindered by the complete breakdown of social services and fear of future Russian attacks in the city. About 30,000 civilians have fled Mariupol city so far, local authorities said. Mariupol’s city hall said that “80% of residential housing was destroyed” and about 350,000 residents were hiding in shelters and basements in Mariupol. In addition to the bombing of its theatre, the city hall said a swimming pool sheltering civilians, “mostly women, children and the elderly” had also been shelled. More than 20 people were killed and 25 injured when a Russian airstrike destroyed a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-east Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, local officials said. The attack took place at 3.30am local time (1.30am GMT) on Thursday, the Kharkiv prosecutor’s office said. Ten people were in critical condition, it said. The US state department confirmed that a US citizen died in Ukraine today, after local reports that an American was killed during Russian shelling in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv. Earlier today, Chernihiv regional police said authorities were “documenting the aftermath of enemy shelling of civilians in central Chernihiv” that left more than 50 people dead. The US has anecdotal signs of flagging Russian troop morale in some units in Ukraine, a senior US defence official said, without citing evidence. The US has also observed that the Russian military is moving some forces “from the rear to join their advancing elements” and “some of those capabilities are artillery, long-range artillery”, suggesting they “continue to want to conduct a siege of Kyiv”. The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Melitopol, who was allegedly abducted by Russian forces, was freed in exchange for nine captured Russian conscripts, according to the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. Ukraine had accused Russia of kidnapping Ivan Fedorov last Friday, with surveillance footage appearing to show him being marched across a square in the city centre, apparently surrounded by Russian soldiers. Lawyers are drafting a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow but a breakthrough depends on the Kremlin accepting a ceasefire, Ukraine’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov, who has been leading the Ukrainian delegation in the negotiations, said technical work was progressing but that Russia had to stop its shelling for any compromise to be possible. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said “we have stronger hopes for a ceasefire” after meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in Lviv. The meeting follows Çavuşoğlu’s visit to Moscow yesterday, where he declared: “We have not lost our belief in diplomacy.” But western officials have warned there remains a “very big gap” between Ukraine and Russia in peace talks between the two countries. Reuters quotes an unnamed official as saying both sides are taking peace talks seriously but that there was little sign of an imminent breakthrough. Zelenskiy invoked the fall of the Berlin Wall in an attempt to persuade German MPs to do everything possible to halt Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to the German parliament via video, the Ukrainian president upbraided Germany for having persisted in the past in its insistence that the gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 and other business projects with Russia were “purely economic” and not political. The US president, Joe Biden, will speak with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Friday to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine “and other issues of mutual concern”, the White House said. Earlier, a Chinese official criticised the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, for his comments that China had an obligation as a member of the UN security council to help bring an end to the war in Ukraine. A Russian court has extended the arrest of the US basketball star Brittney Griner for at least two more months, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. Griner, a two-time Olympic champion, has been detained by Russian customs authorities, who claim they discovered vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. Uzbekistan’s foreign minister has called for a diplomatic resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and said it would not recognise Moscow-backed separatists in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, Reuters reports. Abdulaziz Kamilov’s remarks signalled the strongest anti-war statement to come from Russia’s former Soviet allies so far.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 23 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-23-of-the-invasion
3/18/2022,"Scrolling through the news this week I see articles about Centrelink payments being bumped up to cover inflation. I click the link hoping that the headlines are true and those of us on welfare payments will get some much-needed relief from the cost of living. As I read it I’m disappointed but not surprised. The increase is for pensioners and it’s for about $20 a fortnight. This is of course the regular indexation that pensioners get twice a year. For those on jobseeker where our indexation is adjusted by CPI, we get even less. Each time there’s a small regular increase I see stories with headlines about “cash splashes” and “those on the dole to get extra cash”. People who see the headlines must think with all these stories that we’re sitting comfortably in our houses with fully stocked pantries and extra cash. Most don’t read the actual stories to find out the increase is always a small amount which won’t cover the cost-of-living expenses that we are all facing. For many like myself, the small increases won’t bring any relief at all. Groceries that used to cost me $80 a fortnight now cost almost double that amount. I’ve always been very good at budgeting but you simply can’t make money stretch that you don’t have. Petrol alone is fluctuating between $2 and $2.20 a litre which has now made driving impossible for some. I’ve now been priced out of buying red meat. Having to explain to people that it’s now cheaper to take iron tablets and vitamins than to buy the foods you get these nutrients from is something I never thought I’d have to do. The cost of living has risen fast and will continue to do so, and those hardest hit are those already living under the poverty line. People living in public housing will also face a rent increase which will take a quarter of the raise. Those living in private rentals already face huge costs in rents. People with higher incomes won’t feel the pinch of some grocery items costing an extra 30 cents but when you apply that cost to multiple groceries, it adds up. For those of us who can’t afford the increases, we simply go without or have to make cuts to other items in the budget such as prescriptions. We’re not out here living the high life; instead we’re facing impossible choices just to survive. Choices that shouldn’t have to be made between eating or taking needed medications, both of which impacts heavily on mental and physical health. Many are being forced to use services like Afterpay just to afford the basics and then the next fortnight are in the same predicament – but now with the added cost of a repayment. It’s a vicious cycle, and a small increase won’t break it. It will just condemn us further into debt. Last week while shopping online I had to delete butter off my list as I didn’t have enough money to pay for it. I’m only thankful I wasn’t physically in the store where I would have had to feel the shame telling the cashier to put items back. Fancy admitting you can’t afford basic grocery items, but that’s something I’m now used to doing. There’s no dignity in poverty – that’s something else that costs too much and is out of reach for many. I don’t look forward to payday because all it brings is stress as I try to get as much out of the money as I possibly can and I still have to go without necessities. This is the true cost of inflation. It costs more to get less. So next time you see the headlines about massive increases, don’t be fooled. It’s not the government being generous or helping those in poverty. It’s more of a dog-whistle to those who think we’re choosing to live this way, and the government is supporting a make-believe lavish lifestyle. People on government payments are going hungry and there’s no one in the current government who seems willing to throw us a bone or a tub of butter.
