4/20/2022,"MBS erupted at US national security advisor Jake Sullivan when the two men met for the first time last year, WSJ reported. The crown prince started ""shouting"" at Sullivan after he brought up Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder. Khashoggi was assassinated in 2018, and the CIA later concluded that MBS personally ordered his killing. Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman erupted at national security advisor Jake Sullivan during a meeting last year when Sullivan brought up the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. That's according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported that the argument happened last September, when the two men met for the first time since President Joe Biden took office. Although the crown prince wanted to strike a ""relaxed tone"" for their meeting, he ""ended up shouting at Mr. Sullivan after he raised the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"" the newspaper reported. ""The prince told Mr. Sullivan he never wanted to discuss the matter again,"" people familiar with the discussion told The Journal. The crown prince also said that the US ""could forget about its request to boost oil production."" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman recently visited the US where he met with many top politicians and businesspeople. President Trump, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, and others received a visit from the crown prince. Ellen R. Wald, author of ""Saudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom's Pursuit of Profit and Power"" explains the crown prince's motivations for these meetings. Khashoggi, 59, a longtime Washington Post columnist known for his criticism of the Saudi kingdom, was assassinated and dismembered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018, after going there to get paperwork for his upcoming marriage. The CIA concluded a little over a month later that Prince Mohammed, also known as MBS, had personally ordered Khashoggi's murder. The Journal's report on Tuesday detailed at length the deterioration of the US's relationship with Saudi Arabia over the last several years. Those divisions have deepened since Russia launched a full-scale, unprovoked invasion in Ukraine in February. The US and other Western nations have pushed the kingdom to increase its production of crude oil to offset rising oil prices and squeeze Russia's ability to finance its war. But, The Journal reported, Saudi Arabia has refused to do so thus far and its interests remain aligned with Russia's. This story is breaking. Check back for updates.

4/20/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukraine's military has received additional aircraft as well parts for repairs to get damaged aircraft flying again, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. Ukraine has defied expectations of allies and military experts by not only keeping its air force operational nearly two months after the start of Russia's invasion but actually repairing aircraft and, apparently, adding to its inventory. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby did not offer details on which countries provided aircraft, but acknowledged new transfers and said Ukraine had more operable fighter aircraft than it had two weeks ago. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Kirby told a news briefing, without elaborating. Kirby said Washington had not provided any aircraft to Kyiv. ""We certainly have helped with the trans-shipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs, but we have not transported whole aircraft,"" he said. Still, that might soon change. The United States has announced plans to transfer Russian-made helicopters to Ukraine that had once been intended for Afghanistan. More than 50 days into the war, the skies over Ukraine are still contested in part due to Ukraine's fleet of aircraft and air defenses, including portable, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles provided by the United States and its allies. That has allowed Ukraine to wage a much more effective ground campaign than if Russia had air dominance and could defend its invading forces from the skies.

4/20/2022,"Great whites in the Florida Keys can be a rare sight. The large migratory predators prefer cooler water and are just passing through when they’re spotted in South Florida. But when they do show up, most anglers, divers and others on the water view it as a treat. That was the case when Amanda Callahan, Chris Marotti, Fred Lewie and Eric Rasmussen, all of Cudjoe Key in the Lower Keys, went out for a day of fishing Friday. At about 1:30 in the afternoon, they were about seven miles southwest of the American Shoal lighthouse in 280 feet of water when a male great white began cruising around Rasmussen’s Calcutta open fisherman boat. “The Gulfstream was in close that day and all the right conditions were present, the right time of day, current, tide, water temp and wind which made for a lot of activity,” Callahan told the Miami Herald/FLKeysnews.com. Callahan, an avid diver and angler, began filming the shark both underwater and on the surface. She posted the footage on her Aquablu Youtube channel. “The fishing and diving this last holiday weekend was great. We estimated the great white to be around 11 to 12 feet in length as the boat’s beam [width] is around 9 feet and the shark easily exceeded that,” Callahan said. “A healthy 12-foot male great white shark would weigh around 1,000 pounds.” They knew it was a male by the two claspers in between the shark’s front pelvic and rear anal fins, Callahan said. The way the shark was swimming, Callahan said it wasn’t in feeding mode and didn’t appear too interested in the boat or the people on board splashing to get its attention. “He wasn’t feeding because we threw a dead bonito, and he wasn’t interested,” Callahan said. “But, it was awesome to see.” Callahan, 31, is a professional scuba instructor and rebreather diver, who has been diving for over six years. “We don’t want to encourage people to get in the water with an apex predator, and this stuff should only be done under the supervisor of professionals,” she said. Moretti, Callahan’s boyfriend, is also a longtime diver. “The other two guys have decades of angling experience in the Lower Keys,” she said. Mahmood Shivji, professor at Nova Southeastern University’s department of Biological Sciences and the director of the Guy Harvey Research Institute, said white sharks “are long-distance travelers as a natural part of their life-cycle, and have been known to move through South Florida waters during their migrations.” When they’re not migrating, they prefer cooler ocean waters, and that’s where they tend to hang out. “White sharks are one of only a handful of sharks that can keep their core body temperatures warm, and so can roam in cooler waters,” Shivji said. White sharks are not listed as endangered, but they are federally managed, and it is not legal to harvest them. Shivji calls them “an absolute marvel of evolution,” and cited recent research at Nova’s Halmos College of Arts and Sciences as an example. In that work, researchers at the South Florida school sequenced the whole genome of the white shark species. Shivji said the scientists “found remarkable positive genetic changes in many of its genes” that make its genome more stable. This could have positive impacts on human medicine since unstable genomes result in cancer. Shivji said the research also found positive changes in the sharks’ genes involved in their wound-healing process that might explain how the fish are able to recover so quickly from injuries. “It’s a privilege to see such an amazing animal live in its natural habitat,” Shivji said after seeing Callahan’s video.",U.S./Miami Herald,Watch what happens when a great white shark circles a fishing boat in the Florida Keys,https://news.yahoo.com/watch-happens-great-white-shark-204046756.html
