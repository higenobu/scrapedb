5/2/2022,"This was a BBC National Orchestra of Wales concert not quite like any other, its CoLaboratory label suggesting both collaborative and experimental elements and highlighting the varied talents of the French-Irish conductor and violinist Fiona Monbet. Her precise conducting of Darius Milhaud’s ballet suite La Création du Monde – inspired by his encounter with jazz in 1920s New York, with its sensuous fusion of lyrical lines and jazz-inflected harmonies – helped set up the rest of the programme. Iain Ballamy was the soloist in the premiere of Luke Styles’ saxophone concerto Tracks in the Orbit. In three movements entitled respectively Mill, Devotional and Whirlpool, Styles had fashioned a work indulging all of Ballamy’s laidback virtuosity, improvisatory instincts and his characteristic tone, velvet but edgy when needed. Yet the sense was sometimes of music – and perhaps Ballamy, too – needing to break the constraints and take off. At the very end came a sudden effusion of orchestra and soloist together, but short-lived and fizzling out. Having Ballamy on the spot, as it were, was clearly too good an opportunity to miss and he was called on to add extra colour to Monbet’s own suite, Trois Reflets. As a violinist, she maintains two parallel disciplines, classical and jazz – in the latter hailed as spiritual daughter by her mentor, the late Didier Lockwood, whom the legendary Stéphane Grappelli regarded as his spiritual son – but this piece was also a reflection of Monbet’s growing aspirations as a composer. Embracing a succession of differing styles – blues, bossa nova and Irish folk among them – it defied categorisation, a meandering and eventually slightly straggling musical parade. Monbet was obviously central to it all, an unassuming and mesmerising presence. Only conducting when necessary, she was by turns a brilliant violin soloist, with amplification helping to characterise her sound; a duettist in dynamic partnership with Ballamy; and perhaps most authentic in the solo bursts in harness with her own jazz quartet, pianist, Auxane Cartigny, bassist Arthur Hennebique and drummer Philippe Maniez. If Monbet proved her naturally multifaceted musicianship, the suite also showcased the BBC NOW in full chameleon mode: chamber orchestra, big band, Mantovani strings, Tijuana brass, Irish fiddlers … nothing defeated them. Occasionally, however, they were left redundant, albeit happily appreciating the frontliners. It was certainly an evening of great fun, if not always great music.

5/2/2022,"A legal requirement that new houses do not pollute nearby wetlands, rivers and nature reserves has halted development across a swath of England. Forty-two local authorities in England were last month told they must ensure that new homes are “nutrient neutral” and do not add damaging nitrates or phosphates to river catchments and protected areas including the Eden Valley in Cumbria, the River Camel in Cornwall and the Norfolk Broads. In these areas – close to protected sites such as special areas of conservation (SACs) – planning authorities are unable to permit new applications for any kind of home until developers prove they are not adding to nutrient pollution. Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, has already required developers in 32 local authorities to demonstrate they are causing no additional pollution of protected sites after a 2018 court of justice ruling to protect conservation areas designated by the EU. Nutrient pollution causes algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water, killing fish and damaging other aquatic life. Farming is the main cause of excess nutrients washing into rivers and wetlands alongside discharges from overloaded sewage works but rainwater running off roads and new developments can also add to the pollution. The Home Builders Federation estimates that up to 120,000 new homes have been delayed because of the “nutrient neutrality” rules in 74 local authority areas, with 42,000 new homes delayed in the greater Norwich area alone. In some areas, such as the Solent, mitigation measures have been established, with developers able to purchase nitrate credits from landowners including environmental charities who use the money to rewild farms or create pollution-absorbing wetlands in the catchment. But many local councils complain they have not been given adequate notice to enable new developments to continue, so cannot meet their mandatory new housing targets. In Norfolk, there are no mitigation schemes established yet, with all development without full planning permission paused within the catchment of the Broads and the River Wensum, both of which contain damaging levels of nutrient pollution. The government’s demand for “nitrate neutrality” was welcomed by Rosie Pearson, the chair of the Community Planning Alliance, a grassroots campaign group for sustainable development. “It’s great to see and a rare example of where the public protective system is doing what it should,” she said. “But with councils bound by their five-year housing supply targets and one government department saying ‘build, build, build’ and then Natural England and Defra going ‘you can’t build, you’re harming the environment,’ it is a complete mess.” Mitigating nutrient pollution with the creation of new wetlands was “a sticking plaster” according to Pearson. “All these wetlands will be created that will be great for nature but the government constantly ignores the underlying problem, which is the sewage system.” Housebuilders are warning the measures could cost developers up to £5,000 per home and affordable homes and council houses will be delayed. A study in Somerset found that the urban environment contributes 4% of nutrient pollution, with the vast majority caused by farming and sewage discharges. James Stevens, the director for cities at the Home Builders Federation, said: “Developing a consistent and standardised mitigation approach on water neutrality is essential to removing the growing block it is causing to housing supply. “We are urging government to agree proportionate measures that reflect the contribution of housing delivery to the issue without delay. The situation has already been ongoing for some years and it is imperative that solutions are agreed and implemented urgently.” In the Solent, where nutrient neutrality rules began in 2018, it took 18 months for mitigation sites to be established but Natural England said it would be much quicker for the 42 new local authorities because there was a nutrient calculator and £100,000 funding to help councils and developers identify solutions. In South Hampshire, nutrient credits bought by developers have enabled more than 3,000 “nutrient-neutral” new homes to be built. Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust (HIWWT) has used credits to buy two farms totalling 450 acres in the Solent catchment, rewilding intensively fertilised land that was causing nutrient pollution, restoring biodiversity as well as removing 25% more nitrates than the credits instructed. “It’s working,” said Debbie Tann, the chief executive of HIWWT. “It means that development is able to mitigate its impact but it’s really important to acknowledge that pollution in the Solent is terrible and just doing this is not going to clean it up. What we really need to tackle is farming, reducing fertilisers, and the water companies need to tackle sewage discharge. “This is a good step by Natural England but we need government to step up on the other issues as well.” Melanie Hughes, the director of sustainable development at Natural England, said all of the affected protected wetland sites were in “unfavourable condition” because of nutrient pollution, such as stinking mats of algae covering salt marsh in the Solent, which prevent wading birds from feeding in the mud. “We can’t carry on polluting in these areas – that’s the line that’s been drawn,” she said. “We’re pleased that we’re using nature-based solutions to help resolve the problem, which have much wider benefits.”",News/Environment,Wetlands protection law delays building of new homes in England,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/02/wetlands-protection-law-delays-new-homes-building-england
5/2/2022,"Brian Friel’s drama of colonisation becomes a timeless study of change and adaptation in a taut new co-production between Belfast’s Lyric theatre and the Abbey, Dublin. Based on the mapping of Ireland’s landscape in the 1830s, Friel’s play has been performed all over the world since its premiere by Field Day in 1980. Director Caitríona McLaughlin highlights its universality, avoiding sentimentality, with designers Joanna Parker (set) and Paul Keogan (lighting) creating a strikingly abstract stage picture: a sloping ridge evoking a cottage roof against a summer night’s sky. In Donegal, where place names are being translated into English for Ordnance Survey maps, the English soldiers tasked with this exercise are assisted by a local man. Owen (Leonard Buckley) mediates between them and the villagers, who speak Irish only. When Lieutenant Yolland (Aidan Moriarty) becomes enthralled by the Irish language and landscape, he is teased by Owen for his misty romanticism: “The first hot summer in 50 years and you think it’s Eden.” Change is encroaching on all fronts, as the makeshift hedge schools that teach Latin and Greek literature through Irish are about to be replaced by national schools where English will be compulsory. Owen’s father, the erudite and bibulous Hugh (Brian Doherty) and his put-upon son Manus (Marty Rea), both teachers, are forced to grapple with questions of language, communication and identity, personal and political. Refusing to speak English to the soldiers, Manus resents Owen’s pragmatism, while Owen finds himself caught uneasily between two cultures. Although every character in this ensemble is given clarity and depth through subtle performances, the love scene between Yolland and Maire (Zara Devlin) has less emotional impact here than the tense interaction between the two brothers, compellingly played by Rea and Buckley. Is their old language a barrier to progress, as Maire believes? Offering to teach her English, Hugh makes telling observations on the limitations of language, while articulating what is being lost. Often pompous, sometimes ridiculous, Doherty’s Hugh also has immense dignity. His proud assertion to the soldiers of his affinity with European culture emphasises the central, resonant idea: that identity is complicated – and not binary.

5/2/2022,"Kayla Ellis’s children came home from school recently and asked their mother what was going on: the hallway was full of bags of clothing, trainers and toys. Ellis remembers her own mother also eyeing the chaos – and telling her she’d bitten off more than she could chew. Her mother was referring to the unofficial charity shop that Ellis has installed in her house. Ellis, a 31-year-old gardener from Cardiff, says: “I’ve got some builders coming next week to give me a quote to build a shed in the garden, so I can store the rest of the stuff in there.” Ellis did not intend to create a charity shop in her house; it just sort of happened. (Technically, it’s not a charity shop, as all items are free, but locals call it that and it has caught on.) The idea started when her son was picked on at school because he didn’t have a trendy backpack. Ellis knew from personal experience how much having the “right” items – the fashionable bag, trainers and coat – matters when you’re a teenager. “My mum worked hard to get me everything I needed when I was a child,” she says. “But I didn’t always have the stuff everyone else had.” She remembers being obsessed as a teen with a specific pair of gold earrings that all her friends had but she couldn’t afford. “Children shouldn’t be made to feel they are different from anyone else,” she says. “They should feel equal to their surroundings and peers. I know what it feels like when you don’t, and it’s not nice.” Ellis is a member of a number of local buy-and-sell Facebook groups, and over the years she would often see young people on there asking for items for free. One boy, she recalled, asked if anyone had a spare school tie, because his parents couldn’t afford to buy him one. Another teenager was asking for a mobile phone. A third was desperate for a specific hooded sweatshirt. She thought about items in her house that she no longer needed, and rummaged around in her drawers, unearthing mobile phones and a tablet she no longer used. Ellis posted them on Facebook, asking if anyone would like them. Within minutes, they were claimed. “I thought OK,” she says, “there are kids out there who need this stuff.” Next, she began soliciting donations from her community, asking for anything clean and in good condition that young people might want: toys, electronics, clothes, makeup, shoes. The donations started rolling in immediately, and haven’t stopped. “Everyone has been absolutely amazing,” she says. The day we speak, she’s just had someone drop off an iPad mini, an iPod, some hair straighteners and some unused makeup. Tomorrow, she’s going to collect a PlayStation 4. She’s also had Nintendo Wiis, board games, and endless toys, clothes and shoes. Whenever anything comes in, Ellis posts details on her Facebook page, and it goes to the first person to claim it. Ellis does drop-offs twice a week, or people are welcome to collect from her in the evenings – her doorbell is constantly ringing. Nothing hangs about for long. “What she’s doing is amazing. She puts all her time and effort into helping people. It’s rare when you see that,” says Dawn Duggan, a mother of 10 who knows first-hand how hard it is to get her children all the latest gadgets. Her son recently broke his phone – it fell out of his pocket when cycling to school – and Ellis helped source him a new one. “He went there straight after school and she gave him it,” Duggan says. “He couldn’t believe it.” “I’m shocked at how many people are struggling at the moment,” Ellis says. “We’re going through a crisis.” Many families who contact her are in work, but don’t have money for luxuries. “I welcome everyone, not just people on benefits. Children shouldn’t just have the basics of life. They should have the kinds of games and toys their peers have.” Ellis is also giving a second life to items that are often destined to landfill. “This is stuff that might otherwise be going to the tip,” she says. “We’re doing our bit for the planet.” For a treat, Ellis asks for something unexpected: cleaning products. “I love a good cleaning session,” she says. “There’s nothing better. I like to get stuck in before the kids get back from school. There’s that half-hour where everything is immaculate and it’s all nice and peaceful.” Plus, as her “charity shop” is in her home, it’s good to stay on top of the mess. Eco-friendly cleaning brand Iron & Velvet provides Ellis with a year’s worth of supplies, plus reusable bottles and cloths. Ellis is already eyeing up her oven for a good scrub. “I can’t wait,” she says. And with the prospect of getting her home in order, a charity-shop-running mother is very satisfied.

5/2/2022,"If there’s an abiding image of 2022’s Sound City, it’s the cartons of water provided by one of the festival’s corporate sponsors; essentially, it looks as if all the artists are chugging milk on stage. It sparks bemusement and mirth in equal measure and captures the festival’s entire atmosphere in microcosm – there’s a pleasant irreverence blanketing Liverpool city centre. “It’s water, I swear!” protests Peter Harrison to one of the festival’s many cries of “Is that milk?” as his band San Lorenz – whose dramatic art rock and cutting vocals have set them apart as local favourites – deliver one of the sets of the weekend in the Arts Club’s sweltering attic. “This water’s a fuckin’ con!” exclaims Crawlers vocalist Holly Minto as she struggles with a flimsy carton in the same venue hours earlier, gleefully rejecting heckles to down the whole thing. Foremost among a new wave of punchy young rock bands in Liverpool, Crawlers’ emotive single Come Over (Again) went viral last year, but they prove themselves more than one-hit wonders. The indefatigable Minto works the crowd, striking a perfect balance between witty badinage and heart-on-sleeve earnestness. Over the course of half an hour, two middle-aged punks go from indifference to leaping around and grinning like teenagers. As indicated by a banner next to the stage in the basement of Jimmy’s, which features photographs of Ed Sheeran, Stormzy and Florence Welch playing sets in their early years, Sound City has a reputation for platforming the next big thing. If there’s a future megastar among the lineup this year it’s probably Brooke Combe. In the cavernous EBGBs, she races through a tight set of big-chorus blues and rock with unshakeable swagger. Londoner Amy Fitz Doyley shows similar potential in the loungelike Phase One in the space of a three-song, 15-minute set. She’s in possession of a considerable voice but employs it subtly as she slowly unfurls her hypnotic electronic pop. Sound City has been through many evolutions since a lacklustre rebrand as a traditional fenced-off outdoor festival in the city’s former docklands in 2015, then an experimental era in the gentrifying Baltic Quarter. After cancellation in 2020, and a 2021 edition squeezed between spikes in coronavirus cases, there’s a sense that for the first time in years, the festival is in its rightful place: bands and fans weaving their way among football fans and stag-dos as they make the short walks from one venue to another. The only problem is that so many of the shows occupy a similar space, musically. The vast majority are indie bands, singer-songwriters and four-piece guitar acts. Many are fantastic, particularly those who take things into heavier territory – TV Priest’s punishing post-punk, Tel Aviv band Monad’s ambitious psychedelia, and hardcore crew Ditz’s intense mid-afternoon gig in the dingy Shipping Forecast basement, in particular. The biggest names on the bill are Self Esteem, Yard Act, Alfie Templeman and the Lathums, and all prompt queues around the block. Yet there’s still a nagging sense of something missing. There’s not much hip-hop, for instance, aside from Xadi’s drifting melodic rap, and Canada’s Mouraine, who wins over a small crowd in The Jacaranda on Sunday afternoon. The sole representative of Liverpool’s currently burgeoning experimental scene is the utterly superb Claire Welles; there’s next to no dance music at all. Sound City still feels like a festival in resurgence, which concludes fittingly enough with a descent into all-out mayhem. The final act of the weekend, Italian rockers Piqued Jacks, possess nuclear levels of bombast, careening around the minuscule Kazimier Stockroom like they’re headlining the world’s biggest stadium, doling out lick after lick of unabashed hard rock anthems. A crowd of 30 or so are sent delirious. Not for the first time this weekend, it’s impossible to stop grinning.",Arts/Music,"Liverpool Sound City review – mirth, mania and future megastars at resurgent festival",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/02/liverpool-sound-city-review-mirth-mania-and-future-megastars-at-resurgent-festival
5/2/2022,"A Barcelona housing co-operative that had been in existence less than a year when Spain imposed one of Europe’s toughest lockdowns has won a prestigious architecture award after its model of community living thrived during the pandemic. The wood-framed La Borda scheme of 28 apartments and several shared spaces has won the prestigious Mies van der Rohe prize for emerging architecture for a project that the awards committee described as “a transgressive … model based on co-ownership and co-management of shared resources and capacities”. The occupants had been there barely a year when lockdown came, which was when the communal plan of the building really came into its own, says Cristina Gamboa, a leading figure in the field of sustainability who, with Pol Massoni, was the principal architect. Once it became clear that none of the occupants had Covid it was possible to make use of the shared spaces – including a kitchen-dining area, laundry, multipurpose space, guest rooms as well as a patio, bike parking and terraces – to minimise the sort of isolation suffered by people in more conventional housing. “It was a privilege to live through Covid here,” Gamboa says. “It showed that these spaces allow for the sort of interaction that wouldn’t be possible in a conventional apartment block. For example, the guest rooms couldn’t be used because no one was travelling so they became work spaces.” Unlike the experiments in communal living in London squats such as St Agnes Place and Villa Road in the 1980s and 90s, which were carried out in family houses, La Borda is designed with the collective in mind. Since Covid restrictions were lifted, every Wednesday about two-thirds of the occupants have been meeting for dinner in the communal dining room. “La Borda is exemplary in terms of design for home-based work, a rare thing in social housing,” says Frances Holliss, architect and author of Beyond Live/Work: the Architecture of Home-based Work. “Homes can be expanded to include a workspace – on a different floor, if preferred. The building is designed at every turn to increase social interactions and build community, which reduces social isolation – the bane of the home-based worker.” The La Borda project emerged from a local campaign to reclaim the abandoned industrial complex at Can Batlló in the Sants area of the city for use by the community, which in turned spawned Lacol, a collective of young architects interested in developing participative projects. Inspired by housing schemes in Denmark and Uruguay, as well as figures from the 1970s such as the Belgian architect Lucien Kroll, Gamboa and her colleagues at Lacol were motivated by three principles: sustainability, participation and community. “Our model is for accessible, not speculative housing, but we also wanted to create something easy to replicate, not a closed community,” says Gamboa, who lives in the building. The design, with its large internal patio and light well, harks back to the “corral” concept common in Madrid and southern Spain, where the central space serves as both a meeting place and natural air conditioning. The timber construction allows the flats to be adaptable while also improving insulation and minimising environmental impact. “It’s a passive building with active participants,” Gamboa says. Co-op members, who range from people in their 20s to retirees, don’t own their flats, nor can they sell or pass them on. Rent and living costs are about 30-35% below market rates. Solar panels supply electricity to communal areas while a shared laundry keeps bills lower and frees up living space. Prospective members pay a refundable fee of €18,500 (£15,485) but with 50 people already on the waiting list, Gamboa says the only solution is to build more. Only 1.5% of Barcelona’s housing stock is public and the rest is increasingly out of reach of most pockets, especially the young, with the result that around 80% of 18- to 30-year-olds still live with their parents. Gamboa says winning the Mies van der Rohe award was a surprise, adding that “it’s great to see other ways of doing architecture receiving recognition”. Some of the €20,000 prize money will go towards a celebratory dinner for the occupants and others involved in bringing the project to fruition.",News/World news,Barcelona housing co-op wins prestigious architecture award,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/barcelona-housing-co-op-la-borda-wins-architecture-award
5/2/2022,"The Spanish government has said the mobile phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the defence minister, Margarita Robles, were both infected last year with the Pegasus spyware that its manufacturers claim is available only to state agencies. In a hastily convened press conference on Monday morning, Félix Bolaños, the minister for the presidency, said Sánchez’s phone was targeted in May and June 2021, while Robles’s was targeted in June 2021. Data was extracted from both phones. Bolaños said the “illicit” and “external” targeting would be investigated by Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, adding the targeting must have come from abroad as any such monitoring in Spain would have had required judicial authorisation. “These facts have been confirmed and are irrefutable,” said Bolaños. “I don’t think now is the time to engage in supposition or conjecture about what the motivation may have been.” The phones of other members of the government are being examined to determine whether they may also have been targeted. The allegations come as the Spanish government faces questions over how Pegasus – which is sold by the Israeli company NSO Group – allegedly came to be used to monitor dozens of members of the Catalan independence movement, including the president of the north-eastern Spanish region, Pere Aragonès, and three of his predecessors. Last month, Aragonès told the Guardian the alleged targeting, revealed by Citizen Lab cybersecurity experts, constituted a violation of individual rights, an attack on democracy, and a threat to political dissent. The Catalan regional government has pointed the finger at Spain’s National Intelligence Centre (CNI), which insists its operations are overseen by the supreme court and that it acts “in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws”. The Spanish government has promised an internal CNI investigation into the alleged targeting of Catalan activists, while Spain’s public ombudsman has also opened an independent investigation. Aragonès has called for Robles – who oversees the CNI as defence minister – to resign, and his Catalan Republican Left party has threatened to withhold its support for the government in the national parliament. The Catalan president said in a statement: “Any political espionage is extremely serious. We reported spying a few days ago but were not given an explanation by the Spanish government. When it’s massive spying on Catalan institutions and the independence movement, it was all silence and excuses. With this, it’s all moving very fast. Responsibility needs to be established straight away. A thorough, independent investigation remains urgent and responsibility needs to be taken.” NSO Group said in a statement it would investigate “any suspicion of misuse” of its software, and would cooperate with any governmental investigation. “While we have not seen any information related to this alleged misuse and we are not familiar with the details of this specific case, NSO’s firm stance on these issues is that the use of cyber tools in order to monitor politicians, dissidents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools,” said a spokesperson. “NSO is a software provider; the company does not operate the technology nor is privy to the collected data. The company does not and cannot know who the targets of its customers are, yet implements measures to ensure that these systems are used solely for the authorised uses.” NSO Group claims Pegasus is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists. A joint investigation two years ago by the Guardian and El País established that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament and at least two other pro-independence supporters were warned the spyware had been used to target them. NSO group was placed on a US blacklist in November 2021, three months after a consortium of journalists working with the French non-profit group Forbidden Stories revealed multiple cases of journalists and activists who were hacked by foreign governments using the spyware, including American citizens. The Guardian and other members of the consortium also revealed that the mobile numbers of Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and almost his entire cabinet appeared on a leaked list of individuals who were selected as possible targets of surveillance. NSO has said its spyware is used by foreign government clients to target serious criminals. It has also denied that any of its clients ever targeted Macron or any French government officials.",News/World news,Spanish prime minister’s phone ‘targeted with Pegasus spyware’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/spain-prime-minister-pedro-sanchez-phone-pegasus-spyware
5/2/2022,"“Phat as fuck.” This was how jungle legend Gavin King – AKA Aphrodite – described the powerful bass capabilities of his Amiga 1200 home computer in a 90s interview. Several decades later, it remains in his studio. With its drab grey buttons, it looks more suited to tax returns, but Amiga machines are instrumental in electronic music as we know it. “The thing about the Amiga bassline is that it was constant volume, it didn’t waver,” King says now, “so when you pulled it up to the maximum volume that you could press on to vinyl, it made it, well, phat as fuck.” In the early 90s, the artists who used these Amigas didn’t know it yet, but their experimentation would become central to the burgeoning hardcore, jungle and drum’n’bass scenes, and pave the way for the accessible home electronic music production of the future. Today anyone with a laptop can make music, but, at the dawn of home computing, music production was prohibitively expensive. Back in 1985, Atari released its ST home computer, which instantly became a hit with gamers and DIY producers. Rival Commodore quickly followed up with the Amiga 1000, but things really changed in 1987 when the company released the Amiga 500. It may only have had 512 kilobytes of memory – that’s 0.0128% of what an iPhone 13 has – but the Amiga was transformational due to its four-channel stereo sound. “It went much further into that bass register than any computer of the time,” says Ben Vost, former editor of Amiga Format magazine, who praises simple music sequencer programs, such as OctaMed, that allowed users to compose their own beats. Inspired by Britain’s second summer of love, King was a house DJ until about 1990, when the hardcore era was beginning to take shape. It was at this time, during his third year in university, studying computer science, that he stumbled on an Amiga playing a looping sample at a friend’s house. “I was like: what’s that? I need that,” King recalls. “By hook or by crook, I managed to get one by borrowing money from my dad, saving, earning.” He started experimenting with the machine, and inserting his own creations into mixes, before he and three friends, all armed with Amiga 500s and calling themselves Cellar-4, got together in a basement and made “a terrible record”. King threw 150 copies into a skip when he was moving house – “sad, really,” he says, because they now sell for £50 each. But King’s next track, made with Claudio Giussani under the Urban Shakedown moniker, wasn’t destined for landfill. Fellow junglist Mickey Finn overheard an early version playing in the City Sounds record shop in London, approached King, and together they produced Some Justice in Carl Cox’s living room. With its reverb-heavy big beats and blaring honks – “How on earth did we make a riff from a car horn?” asks Finn on YouTube – this pioneering tune flew into the UK Top 40 and charted for five weeks. “Our mission was just to make music and to DJ,” King says. “The Amiga was just a tool that allowed us to do that … unbeknownst to us, we would be put on the cover of Amiga Format.” For Marlon Sterling, AKA drum’n’bass producer Equinox, the Amiga’s sound quality “wasn’t great” but it had a “certain sound”, which he loved for its gritty sampling and “Mentasms” – the grizzly hoover noises named after the Joey Beltram track. When mentor and fellow Amiga user Bizzy B introduced Sterling to the Med V3 production software, it was a “massive gamechanger”, he says, giving him the chance to experiment with music on a budget. Equinox’s first tunes were recently released as Early Works 93-94 to a positive reception – “a shock, considering how bad my quality was” – and listening to them now catapults him back to being 15 again. “You found ways to do things,” Sterling says. “I think the limitations back then made you more creative. It wasn’t the sound why I used the Amiga, it was all I could afford. Back then, you needed all sorts of hardware to make music, but just having the Amiga sound sampler and OctaMed, you could get great ideas down without the need to hire a studio. It was the poor man’s studio – even the software was free!” Meanwhile, producers such as Dex and Jonesey broke into the Top 40 with Amiga-made tracks like their souped-up remix of Josh Wink’s Higher State of Consciousness, and even caught flak from the music establishment for daring to eschew the pricier Apple computers most professionals used at the time. But the Amiga’s powerful bass sound and punchy, unique grooves were hard to imitate. Unlike music software such as Cubase or Logic Pro, which reads from left to right, Amiga’s equivalents cascaded from top to bottom in a lo-fi graphical waterfall of bits and bytes. “Because only eight things can play at once at any given time, it makes you work harder,” says King. “You need to go into the actual soundwave.” This hyper-granular approach allowed King to be “forensic right down to the 1,000th of a second” in a way that would take “10 times as long” with Cubase. “I was obsessed with having everything perfectly matching and going at the same time,” he says – still a painstaking task considering the software only showed numbers passing by, rather than labelled blocks of drums and basslines that could be shuffled about more easily. But this learning curve didn’t put off the many Amiga alumni, including a whole cast of fellow junglists, like Dlux, TDK, Zinc, Paradox, and Bizzy B, whom King once spent 18 hours with extracting sounds from their floppy discs. Australian breakcore troublemakers Nasenbluten wielded the machines to devastating effect; away from breaks, Mike Oldfield used an Amiga, while Japanese composer and P-Model frontman Susumu Hirasawa – who used an Amiga to compose the soundtrack for Satoshi Kon’s anime film Paprika – remains an enthusiast, and created the startup sound for a retro Amiga operating system in 2005. Amigas have been employed by contemporary pop producers, too, such as Calvin Harris, who put together debut I Created Disco on an Amiga running OctaMed. Back in the 90s, a buoyant “demo scene” coalesced around the Amiga, where home programmers put together animated music videos, fitting them on tiny 880k floppy disks. Pirated software, meanwhile, would usually feature home-brewed intros, complete with the pirates’ own music, that users had to sit through before they could access their bootlegged copies. This “cracktro” scene had a “huge influence on electronic music that’s often overlooked”, says Danny Wolfers, better known as Legowelt, who learned to make music on his Amiga 500 and still uses the machines today. He says 75% of his first records were made with the computers, he plays live with them, and his upcoming first full-length animated film can also be partially credited to the Amiga, with which he first learned animation. Wolfers and his peers would “load game discs or demos to hear the music and have it in the background. This was, for a large part, the first pure electronic music kids were exposed to intensely, making them more receptive to stuff like the techno emerging from Detroit. “There were no YouTube channels explaining everything – maybe a few Amiga magazines gave pointers, but that was about it,” he adds. “You learned by analysing the music files that came with the software. It was fundamental in my career, giving me a chance to make music while having no access to expensive studio gear or synthesisers.” The Amigas probably launched hundreds of other music careers – including that of Venetian Snares and possibly even Kanye West, who owned one at 14 – teaching aspiring musicians music theory, notes, scales and octaves through determined experimentation. And, even though Commodore declared bankruptcy in 1994, the legacy of these achromatic slabs lives on. Thirty-five years after the debut of the Amiga 500, a new generation of retro-curious musicians will have the chance to experiment with the machines, as the A500 Mini has recently launched. Perhaps it could be as loved as the original – King’s Amiga may now go unused in his studio, but it’s too difficult for him to say goodbye. “I was using it right up to 1997, even after Commodore went bust,” he says. “I just loved it.”",Arts/Music,‘It was the poor man’s studio’: how Amiga computers reprogrammed modern music,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/02/poor-man-studio-amiga-computers-modern-music-jungle-calvin-harris
