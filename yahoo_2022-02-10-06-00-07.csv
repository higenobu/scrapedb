2/10/2022,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Risk of new heart problems much higher after COVID recovery Long after recovery from COVID-19, people face significantly higher risks for new heart problems, a large study has found. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs compared rates of new cardiovascular problems in 153,760 individuals infected with the coronavirus before vaccines were available, 5.6 million people who did not catch the virus, and another 5.9 million people whose data was collected before the pandemic. An average of one year after their recovery from the acute phase of the infection, the COVID-19 survivors had a 63% higher risk for heart attack, a 69% higher risk for problematic irregular heart rhythm, a 52% higher risk of stroke, a 72% higher risk of heart failure, and a nearly three times higher risk of a potentially fatal blood clot in the lungs compared with the other two groups, according to a report published on Monday in Nature Medicine. The elevated risks among former COVID-19 patients were evident in young and old, Blacks and whites, males and females, people with and without diabetes and with and without kidney disease, as well as smokers and nonsmokers, said Ziyad Al-Aly of the VA St. Louis Health Care System and Washington University in St. Louis. The risks were high even in people who had mild COVID-19 and did not need to be hospitalized for it, he noted in a Twitter thread. ""It really spared no one,"" Al-Aly told Reuters. ""People with COVID-19 should pay attention to their health and seek medical care if they experience symptoms like chest pain, chest pressure, palpitation, swelling in the legs, etc."" mRNA vaccine side effects no worse in cancer patients COVID-19 vaccines using mRNA technology do not produce any extra short-term side effects in cancer patients, a new study suggests. Researchers surveyed 1,753 recipients of two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, about two-thirds of whom had a history of cancer and about 12% of whom were receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery for their disease. More than 90% of the cancers involved solid tumors. The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to work well in such cases. People with and without cancer reported similar rates of pain at the injection site, muscle pain, joint pain, fever, chills, headache, nausea, and fatigue, the research team reported in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Overall, post-vaccination symptoms were reported by roughly 73% of patients regardless of whether they had cancer, with pain at the injection site being the most common adverse event. Earlier studies have found vaccine hesitancy among cancer patients, the researchers noted. The harms of COVID-19 are ""compounded for patients with cancer who have refused vaccination,"" they said. ""Our data, in combination with those from other sources, show that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is well tolerated by patients with a history of cancer, including those receiving active treatment."" Omicron's route into cells helps explain symptom profile The Omicron variant's method of infecting cells is different from the mechanism most often used by earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, which could help explain Omicron's milder symptom profile, a study published in Nature suggests. Earlier variants use the ACE2 protein on cell surfaces and an enzyme called TMPRSS2 to fuse themselves to the cell membrane and inject their genetic material inside. Omicron prefers to enter cells by creating tiny sacs in the cell membrane called endosomes that cells use to transport materials internally, researchers found. Omicron still attaches itself to ACE2 proteins, but it does not need help from TMPRSS2. In fact, Omicron multiplies most readily in tissues where TMPRSS2 is scarce, such as the nose. In the lungs, where TMPRSS2 is plentiful, Omicron has spread less effectively and caused less damage than earlier variants. The findings help explain ""why the disease is less severe and causes less pneumonia"" with Omicron, said Dr. Ravindra Gupta of the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases in the UK. Gupta also noted that drugs targeting TMPRSS2, such as camostat mesylate, a pancreatitis treatment that has shown some benefit in COVID-19 patients, may be less useful with Omicron.

2/10/2022,"A Texas House candidate complained at a forum that she couldn't let ""kids laugh at"" transgender classmates. Shelley Luther was recorded by the Houston Chronicle speaking about her experiences teaching transgender students. ""I am not comfortable with the transgenders,"" she was recorded saying. A Texas House of Representatives candidate and former teacher was recorded at a forum complaining that she couldn't let ""kids laugh at"" transgender classmates. Shelley Luther, a salon owner and former school Spanish teacher who is running to represent Texas House District 62 in northeast Texas, was recorded by the Houston Chronicle while speaking at a candidate forum on Saturday. In the recording, Luther can be heard speaking about the transgender community and her experience teaching transgender students. ""I am not comfortable with the transgenders,"" she said. ""The kids that they brought in my classroom when they said that this kid is transgendering into a different sex, that I couldn't have kids laugh at them … like, other kids got in trouble for having transgender kids in my class."" —Houston Chronicle (@HoustonChron) February 8, 2022 According to the Houston Chronicle, Luther also said that transgender children in Texas schools are a reason she supports ""school choice,"" or a parent's decision to choose what type of school their child attends. Luther did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The Republican candidate rose to prominence in mid-2020, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared that hair salons and barbershops would be forced to close amidst the pandemic. Luther, the owner of a salon in Dallas, defied the order and kept her business open. Despite being sentenced to seven days in jail, she was released after just two, CBS News reported at the time. Shortly after the order was lifted, Sen. Ted Cruz visited Luther's shop for a haircut and said she was ""wrongly imprisoned when she refused to apologize for trying to earn a living."" Luther's campaign website says that she is also against allowing ""Chinese Nationals into our colleges where they can obtain classified information, steal technology, and essentially learn how to defeat the United States."" Luther previously ran for a position in the Texas State Senate in 2020, losing by 13 percentage points in a runoff election to Republican Drew Springer. Her current competition in the race to become a representative is current state Rep. Reggie Smith, who went unchallenged in the 2020 Republican primary and went on to handily defeat his Democratic challenger in the general election. The Texas Republican primary, which will determine if Luther makes it to the general election ballot, is on March 1, 2022.

2/10/2022,"Move over Hemsworth, Johnson and Wahlberg, there's a new shredded action hero in town. If you haven't seen Alan Ritchson starring in the new Amazon Prime Video series Reacher, then where have you been? Based on the bestselling books by author Lee Child, the series tells the tale of a former US military police officer turned drifter called Jack Reacher who finds himself caught up in a deadly conspiracy. But before Reacher premiered, we caught up with the show's star to find out exactly how he got jacked to play Jack. In an exclusive interview with Men's Health, Ritchson explains how he had eight months to prepare for the role, so he built a gym in his house, began lifting weights and ate a lot of calories. ""It was a full time job trying to eat enough to bulk up for this role,"" he says. Before that though, Ritchson says five simple bodyweight exercises, which he's been using for decades, provided the foundations for Reacher's heft. You can find out exactly what they are below, as well as our fitness editor's, Andrew Tracey's, take on them and a handy 30-minute AMRAP that should prepare you to get ripped like Reacher. ""These five are the core foundation for my routine, and it's been that way for decades and they've served me well,"" says Ritchson. ""[With these exercises] you can still hypertrophy and put on size and you're doing it in a safe and comfortable way."" How: Grab the bars of a dip station with your palms facing inward and your arms straight. Slowly lower until your elbows are at right angles, ensuring they stay tucked against your body and don't flare out. Drive yourself back up to the top and repeat.
 Ritchson says: ""I've done, I don't know, a billion dips in my day. It's one of my primary exercises, and I do them almost every workout, so I'll start or finish off with some dips. I just love what they can do for a physique."" Tracey says: ""Rivaling the bench press for chest-building prowess, dips work the triceps hard too. Raise your legs in front of your body throughout for a core building bonus."" How: Grab the bar above you with your palms facing away from you and your arms fully extended. Your hands should be around shoulder-width apart. Squeeze your shoulder blades together, exhale and drive your elbows towards your hips to bring your chin above the bar. Lower under control back to the start position. Ritchson says: ""If I do 25 pull ups, my abs are tight at the end of it... so I kind of kill two birds with one stone."" Tracey says: ""Building the muscles of your upper back and biceps while challenging your grip and core – a seriously functional movement and sign of upper-body strength."" How: Maintain maximum speed, keeping your torso upright and your shoulders back, while driving off hard from the middle of your foot on each stride. Ensure your breathing is rhythmic and controlled to avoid burning out: in through the nose, out through the mouth. Cover 80m, keeping pace until you cross the line. Ritchson says: ""A lot of dudes they want to skip on the cardio but man you got to exercise the heart just as much as the other muscles."" Tracey says: ""Burning calories, building stamina and working the muscles of the legs without necessarily adding size, sprints are a great option for building a more athletic build."" How:  Lie on the floor with your knees bent and hands lightly touching your head. Engage your core and lift your upper body until your chest almost comes into contact with your knees. Return to the start position and repeat. Tracey says: ""An abdominal-building classic. To focus on the abs and avoid overworking the hip flexors, push your lower back into the ground and avoid sitting up all of the way to keep the tension on your core."" How: Starting in a plank position, slowly lower your chest towards the floor while ensuring your abs are tight and your spine is in neutral position. Slowly push back up to the start position. That's one rep. Tracey says: ""Try performing these after dips for what is known as a ‘mechanical drop-set’. It'll allow you to work the same muscles, but from a slightly ‘easier’ angle, so you can keep repping out and pump up your chest, triceps and shoulders."" Ready to workout like Reacher? Complete as many rounds of the following circuit as possible in 30 minutes (or however long you have). That way if you ever find yourself fighting off five guys in a prison brawl, you know you'll be prepared. ""For 20 years all I've ever done is this routine where I will run to whatever park is near me and I do press-ups, pull-ups, dips and sit-ups and then I sprint in between and then I run home,"" says Ritchson. Pull-ups x5 Dips x10 Press-ups x15 Sit-ups x20 200m sprint Reacher is available to stream on Prime Video now.

2/10/2022,"Jennifer and James Crumbley face involuntary-manslaughter charges in connection to a school shooting. Jennifer Crumbley's coworker testified Crumbley and her husband were ""seeing other people"" in 2021. The coworker said Crumbley would sneak out of work to see someone in a Costco parking lot. At a court hearing on Tuesday, a coworker of Jennifer Crumbley said Crumbley was seeing someone outside her marriage throughout last year and would sneak away from work to be with her extramarital partner. Jennifer and James Crumbley both face involuntary-manslaughter charges in connection with the Oxford High School shooting in November that left four students dead. The Crumbleys are accused of making a firearm too easily accessible to their son, who is accused to carrying out the attack, and ignoring warning signs that he was depressed. Both parents face up to 60 years in prison and $30,000 in fines if convicted. At a preliminary hearing on Tuesday for the couple's manslaughter trial, one of Jennifer Crumbley's coworkers testified that both parents were ""seeing other people"" throughout 2021. Amanda Holland said in Michigan's 52nd District Court that Crumbley was in an extramarital relationship throughout 2021 but couldn't remember specifically when the affair took place. She said Crumbley would often sneak away from work to go see a person in the parking lot of a Costco. Holland said in court that the Crumbleys separated at some point during 2021 but continued living in the same house. Holland testified that the Crumbleys resolved their marital issues around their anniversary but again could not remember the specific date. A defense attorney for Jennifer Crumbley objected to prosecutors asking questions about the couple's extramarital affairs, saying those were irrelevant. The prosecution said the information was relevant because the Crumbleys had a ""duty"" to protect their community from their son and ""what they exposed their son to"" should be relevant. Judge Julie Nicholson overruled the objection, though she said, ""Whether or not there was some type of extramarital relationship between the parties and a duty to the community, I don't know that that is intertwined."" Holland testified that Crumbley returned to work on November 30 from her son's school and told her that the school was requiring her to put her son in counseling. According to Holland, Crumbley showed her a math worksheet that her son completed earlier in the day on which he wrote that his life felt useless and, ""The thoughts won't stop. Help me."" Holland testified that she found the worksheet ""disturbing."" Crumbley told Holland that she felt like a ""failure as a parent"" after her meeting with the school, but Holland said her tone seemed ""sarcastic."" Holland testified that she recommended that Crumbley go pick her son up from school to ""spend some time with him."" Holland said Crumbley told her that she was planning to take her son to a horse barn after school where her family kept their horses. Kira Pennock, who works at the horse barn, previously testified that Crumbley was planning to bring her son by on November 30 for riding lessons. On cross-examination, Holland told the defense attorneys that she didn't know much about the Crumbleys' son or that he was involved in extracurricular activities and was working on becoming a soccer referee. Shannon Smith, a defense attorney for Jennifer Crumbley, also asked Holland whether she was aware that the school told Crumbley that her son was ""not a threat to anyone"" on November 30. Holland replied, ""No."" Read the original article on Insider",U.S./INSIDER,"Mother of Oxford school-shooting suspect was having an affair and snuck away from work to meet with her partner at a Costco parking lot, coworker says",https://news.yahoo.com/mother-oxford-school-shooting-suspect-165308157.html
