1/27/2022,"On Sept. 4, 2017, according to his confession letter, Joel Greenberg called his friend Rep. Matt Gaetz with some bad news. A teenager both men had paid to have sex with was underage, Greenberg claimed. Now, two sources tell The Daily Beast, a cooperating witness can confirm details of that call for one damning reason: He was in Greenberg’s office when the call took place. The witness, “Big Joe” Ellicott—Greenberg’s longtime best friend and an employee at the Seminole County tax office—recently pleaded guilty to fraud and drug charges as part of a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors. Although Ellicott has so far avoided any charges regarding sex trafficking of a minor, which Greenberg pleaded guilty to last May, he was present for the call that Greenberg made to Gaetz on Sept. 4, according to two people briefed on the matter. The call, they said, was short—and Gaetz was the one who ended it. Bombshell Letter: Gaetz Paid for Sex With Minor, Wingman Says While the sources did not know whether Ellicott had discussed the call with investigators, his account would likely be of critical interest, since it would match a key claim Greenberg made separately in a confession letter. That letter is now in the hands of federal agents, The Daily Beast previously revealed. In the letter, which Greenberg wrote after his indictment in late 2020 as part of an effort to land a presidential pardon, the Orlando-area tax official claimed that he, Gaetz, and others had sex with a minor they believed to be 19 at the time. Greenberg first learned she was underage after receiving an “anonymous tip” on Sept. 4, 2017, he wrote. He then confirmed her age by improperly querying the teen’s personal information in the Florida state drivers’ license database, which he had access to as a local tax collector. “Immediately I called the congressman and warned him to stay clear of this person and informed him she was underage,” Greenberg wrote in a handwritten draft of the letter, adding that Gaetz was “equally shocked and disturbed by this revelation.” “There was no further contact with this individual until after her 18th birthday,” he added. A month after The Daily Beast’s report, the same date appeared in another crucial document: Greenberg’s sworn plea agreement with the federal government. The agreement also provided what could prove to be a damning additional detail; it included not just the date, but a timestamp down to the minute of when Greenberg accessed the DMV database to look up the girl’s age—1:29 pm. Ellicott would be able to tie the two pieces of information together. If investigators have Greenberg’s phone records—or Gaetz’s—the metadata could confirm whether Greenberg made the alleged call “immediately” after accessing the database. But those records wouldn’t reveal what was said. Ellicott could provide that information, and confirm that Greenberg had indeed warned Gaetz, who had been first elected to Congress less than a year prior. (Federal agents seized the panhandle Republican’s phone sometime around December 2020.) Florida Shock Jock in Matt Gaetz Circle Pleads Guilty Reached on Wednesday, Ellicott’s attorneys declined to comment. Gaetz’s office did not answer questions about the congressman’s recollection of the phone call, instead repeating a statement it has issued before: “After nearly a year of false rumors, not a shred of evidence has implicated Congressman Gaetz in wrongdoing. We remain focused on our work representing Floridians.” Ellicott had hung out in Greenberg’s friend group for years. Unlike Greenberg, however, the former sports radio shock jock turned pawn shop proprietor was never close with Gaetz, though they attended some of the same parties around the time period in question, according to numerous people familiar with them. But Ellicott’s corroboration, if true, would contradict Gaetz’s repeated assertions that he never had sex with an underage girl as an adult. As he told The Daily Beast last March, ‘“The last time I had a sexual relationship with a seventeen year old, I was seventeen.” Instead, it would suggest that Gaetz has been aware of this fact for nearly the entirety of his time in the House of Representatives. The claim would also cast doubt on Gaetz’s protestations that he was blindsided when The New York Times first reported the accusations in March 2021, which he initially chalked up to merely an attempt to extort him and his wealthy father. He has since confirmed the investigation. While Greenberg claims he warned Gaetz to “steer clear” of the teen, The Daily Beast reported that eight months after the alleged warning, the congressman Venmo’d Greenberg $900 in two back-to-back payments, writing in one memo field “Hit up ___,” using a nickname for the girl. By that time, the girl was five months past her 18th birthday. Gaetz had turned 36 earlier that week—twice her age. Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/27/2022,"China has protested against a US move to pull out consular staff and their families to avoid pandemic control measures in the zero-Covid nation, saying US diplomats risk leaving the ""safest country in world"". This comes after the US embassy in Beijing sent a departure request to Washington for a formal sign- off, as China ramps up Covid-19 containment protocols ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics starting in 10 days. Highlighting China's efficient control of the pandemic, the Chinese foreign ministry called on Washington to ""seriously think through the issues of granting authorisation for the departure of diplomats"". Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. Photo: AP alt=Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. Photo: AP> ""China is undoubtedly the safest country in the world [in terms of Covid-19 prevention],"" ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday, warning that departure would ""only elevate the risk of infections among the Americans [leaving]."" ""China has expressed solemn representation and dissatisfaction to the US,"" Zhao told a daily press briefing in Beijing. ""We hope the US can abide by and follow China's pandemic control measures, seriously understand China's position and concerns, and cautiously handle the so-called authorised withdrawal of diplomats,"" he added. Covid-19 cases in the US soared above 600,000 on Tuesday as the Omicron variant sweeps the country. China reported 44 cases, 24 of them locally transmitted. A source told the Post that the US move on Monday was possibly a response to concerns raised by its diplomats in China, and unlikely to trigger major changes to the operations of the American embassy and consulates there. The first reports about the US State Department weighing whether to authorise such departures came from Reuters, which cited unnamed sources as saying that some embassy staff were upset about Washington being unwilling or unable to secure diplomatic exemptions from the strict quarantine measures. The rules include possible admission to Covid-19 fever clinics and separation from children. However, the State Department said operating status at its embassy and consulates in China had not changed. ""The operating status at our mission in [China] has not changed. Any change in operating status of this nature would be predicated solely on the health, safety, and security of our colleagues and their family members,"" a spokesman told Reuters. US-China relations have been fraught for the past few years, with the most recent spat relating to Covid-19 controls for aviation. The US government on Friday said it would suspend 44 China-bound flights by four Chinese carriers in response to Beijing's decision to suspend some US airlines' flights over Covid-19 concerns. Since December 31, Chinese authorities have suspended 20 United Airlines, 10 American Airlines and 14 Delta Air Lines flights, after some passengers tested positive for Covid-19. Beijing hit back at the suspension of Chinese lights, calling on the US ""to stop disrupting and restricting normal passenger flights"". With the 2022 Winter Olympics just days away, Beijing has been stepping up pandemic control measures, especially after recent Covid-19 flare-ups in the capital and nearby port city of Tianjin. Foreign diplomats in China must abide by all Covid-19 restrictions, such as nucleic acid testing and mandatory quarantine on arrival, although some foreign envoys have not been sent to government-designated quarantine hotels. An internal survey by the US embassy in Beijing showed that a quarter of its staff and their families would prefer to leave China as soon as possible, the Reuters report said. Home quarantine for diplomats should be a baseline requirement, and admission to Chinese fever clinics and hospitals should be voluntary, it quoted a source as saying. The US government should have imposed retaliatory measures for such requirements but failed to do so, the source said. The coronavirus pandemic has become a new point of friction in US-China ties, with US officials repeatedly calling for an investigation into the origin of Covid-19. This comes on top of tussles over trade, big tech, maritime disputes in the South China Sea and alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang. But the two sides have managed to continue high-level dialogue to calm tensions. Lu Xiang, a US affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the restrictions over pandemic concerns will not be weakened. ""When it comes to the movement of diplomats, China will certainly continue to adopt a non-discriminatory policy, and the restrictions due to epidemic considerations will not be weakened,"" he said. ""China will only decide our prevention and control measures in response to the overall control of the outbreak."" Nicholas Burns was sworn in as the new US ambassador to China on Tuesday. Burns' appointment had been held up for months over Republican demands that the US pass a bill to counter Beijing's alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

1/27/2022,"A Wake County man was likely trying to steal valuable parts from a disabled car before getting stuck underneath the car and dying earlier this week, the Wake County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday. Officials believe Joshua Larry Diehl, 50, noticed a disabled Toyota Camry at the intersection of U.S. 64 and Debnam Road near Zebulon sometime on Sunday night. Officials said they think Diehl was trying to steal the car’s catalytic converter when the jack he was using malfunctioned, pinning him underneath the car, sheriff’s office spokesperson Eric Curry said in a news release. Deputies responded to a call of a deceased person at the intersection near Zebulon Monday, shortly after 9 a.m., Curry said. They found Diehl’s body under the disabled Camry. A tow truck driver found his body first after he was called to the location to tow away the Camry, Curry said. It wasn’t clear how long Diehl was stuck underneath the car before he was discovered, Curry said. Catalytic converters, devices located in the exhaust system that convert toxic gases into less harmful pollutants, have become a target for thieves due to the valuable metals they contain, The News & Observer previously reported. Investigators determined that the owner of the Camry was returning home from work on Sunday night when she discovered a flat tire, according to the release. Unable to replace the flat tire, the woman asked a friend to pick her up around 10 p.m. and was planning to have the Camry towed the next morning, the release stated. Officials believe Diehl found the disabled car and started trying to steal its catalytic converter after the woman left the scene. The sheriff’s office is continuing to investigate to determine whether Diehl may have been connected to similar reports of catalytic converter thefts in the area, Curry said. “Unfortunately, these types of thefts are on the rise,” Wake County Sheriff Gerard Baker said in the release. “This is a national problem, partly due to the increased value of the precious metals in the part.” Thefts of catalytic converters nationwide have increased sharply in recent years, up from around 108 thefts a month in 2018 to 282 a month in 2019, and 1,203 a month in 2020, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Locally, thefts have become more frequent as well. The Cary Police Department handled 39 reports of catalytic converter thefts in 2020, but had received 70 reports as of Sept. 23 of last year, Lt. John Reeves told The N&O in September. Replacing a stolen catalytic converter can cost car owners anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000, according to the NICB. A recently enacted state law that took effect on Dec. 1, made the theft of a catalytic converter a felony, the N&O reported. The law also limits who is allowed to possess a catalytic converter that has been removed from a car or truck to people like employees of licensed vehicle dealers, repair shops or metal recyclers and scrapyards.

1/27/2022,"When Katie Mac first signed up for Cerebral, she thought she’d reached the end of a long-running search. At the start of the pandemic, Mac, like millions of other Americans, signed up for therapy sessions through online services. She virtually met with a counselor she found through BetterHelp — one of the most well-known and popular therapy apps — but the service wasn’t a great fit. So she canceled the service after two months and started looking for something different. Months later, that something appeared. All over her TikTok feed, Mac started seeing ads for Cerebral, an online therapy service that promised a range of experts based in every state, with a particular focus on her ADHD — something Mac hadn’t gotten with previous therapists. “I’ve done therapy a few times throughout the years, but my ADHD was always a secondary concern,” Mac, 27, told In The Know. “I had always been focused on working through a more pressing issue.” Feeling optimistic, she decided to give the service a try. But that optimism was quickly replaced by feelings of anger, frustration and betrayal. Her experience, which she later chronicled in a series of viral TikToks, was far from ideal. Mac first posted about Cerebral on Dec. 12. In that video, she warned her fellow TikTokers to ignore Cerebral’s ads and avoid signing up for the service. She then explained how Cerebral allegedly “scammed” her by taking her money and refusing to give her a refund for mental health support she never even received. As Mac explained in that first clip, Cerebral requires users to sign up for a membership before they’re officially matched with a therapist. During that process, Mac entered her credit card details and other personal information, including her home state and what she needed from her sessions. But when it came time for her to choose a therapist, Mac says she encountered a major hurdle. Cerebral’s algorithm only offered her two therapist options, neither of which met her needs. “So I immediately email support, and I’m like, ‘Hey, what’s the deal? Neither of these people meets the criteria I requested,’” Mac explained in her video. “[But] they were like, ‘Oh, those are the only two options in your entire state.’ So hardly the hundreds of options they advertise.” Mac immediately requested to cancel the service and asked for her money back. However, she says Cerebral’s support team refused, claiming that company policy forbids them from offering refunds. Eventually, the company offered her a 30% refund — which she found almost as shocking as being offered nothing at all. “I was like, ‘I didn’t use your service. I never even completed the onboarding process. I never met with a therapist. Like, I got zero out of your service,’” Mac said. As her dilemma grew, Mac began to realize she wasn’t alone. She researched Cerebral on third-party review sites such as Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau (BBB), only to find dozens and dozens of ex-customers with the same complaints. On the Better Business Bureau, there appear to be two main entries for reviews for Cerebral, the most popular of which gives the service a rating of 1.07/5 based on 68 customer reviews. According to that BBB entry, there have been 140 consumer complaints filed against Cerebral in the past 12 months. “Have tried three times to cancel the service, they keep charging my account,” one review on Trustpilot, where Cerebral has a rating of 3.4/5, reads. “All I get is lip service. I have canceled my credit card, and they still get through … Do not use this fraud company.” “What a scam,” another one-star review states. “As part of the sign-up process, you have to pay for the first month before you can see available providers or schedule an appointment. That should have been a red flag.” Learn how to monetize your passion like a pro on this episode of Getting Rich, sponsored by Acura Mac said it was “upsetting” to learn that so many Cerebral customers had a negative experience like hers. “The most frustrating piece was the people who had the same — if not worse — experience as me, and they just gave up,” she told In The Know. “They believed Cerebral when they were told that because they agreed to the Terms of Service, they had waived their right to a refund.” But while many reviewers seemed to have given up, Mac did not. She continued to elevate the issue, ultimately threatening to report Cerebral to the Better Business Bureau — a move that, as she claimed in a follow-up clip on TikTok, finally earned her a full refund. Despite that outcome, Mac has continued to speak out against Cerebral, calling the company “predatory” and accusing it of “gaslighting” its customers. But the reality is that these practices are not uncommon among online therapy services. Amy Morin, a licensed psychotherapist and the editor-in-chief of Verywell Mind, an online mental health resource site, told In The Know that therapy apps use a variety of systems to match users with a therapist. “They all do it very differently,” she said. “Sometimes there’s a computer algorithm that matches you with your needs, and then some of them have a human being on the other side who will give you a therapist.” Morin said she’s seen other companies use a business model similar to Cerebral’s — that is, requiring customers to sign up and pay before they’re matched with a therapist. However, she’s also noticed that structure can cause frustration. In Morin’s experience, customers prefer the ability to choose their own therapist. And they want to know what they’re getting before they pay. “Of course, there’s the issue of, ‘How do I want to pay money if I don’t even know who I’m gonna speak with yet?’” Morin said. “That has been a concern, sort of across the board.” In a statement to In The Know, Cerebral said it has since updated its own policy regarding therapist matching. Now, the company says, users who are unable to match with a therapist after a certain period are able to receive full refunds. “After this incident, we conducted an internal review of our refund process and have updated our policies so that members who are not able to match with a clinician within a specified time period will receive full refunds,” a Cerebral spokesperson told In The Know via email. “Cerebral is dedicated to helping people find the mental health care they need and providing the best experience for everyone. We’re always open to feedback and improving the experience for our members.” Morin said she’s seen other services move away from this model too. And even before its policy change, Cerebral seemed to be a good fit for some customers. In Verywell Mind’s 2021 Online Therapy Awards — which polled both customers and mental health experts on their experiences with several online therapy services — Cerebral won the award for “Best Patient Satisfaction.” One of the app’s biggest benefits, according to Verywell Mind, is its affordability. Cerebral offers three main payment tiers, including a basic plan starting at just $85 per month. As Morin points out, this is a common trend among therapy apps in general. The services have surged in popularity since the start of the pandemic, largely because they offer cheaper, more accessible and more flexible options for therapy. Of course, those benefits can also come with unique downsides. “Low cost for the client is great, but low pay for the therapist often leads to burnout and subpar care,” Rebecca Phillips, a licensed professional counselor and the operator of the Mend Modern Therapy counseling service, told In The Know. “As a whole, these apps are widely known among therapists for low pay. When you have a therapist working for too low pay per client, you have a therapist working with too many clients.” In Morin’s words, online therapy is simply “not the same relationship as if you were in the therapy room.” Many offer tantalizing features — like increased anonymity, text-based counseling and the ability to switch therapists at will — that cater to many situations. But there are drawbacks. It’s why Morin believes the online therapy “pendulum” will eventually swing back toward in-person counseling. “I wonder if at some point people will say, ‘Wait, I want that human connection. I want to go sit in somebody’s office and talk to them face-to-face,’” Morin told In The Know. To Mac, Cerebral is unique among online therapy services. The app has surged in notoriety through ads on TikTok, Facebook and other social media sites, and it even features celebrity endorsers, such as Olympic superstar Simone Biles. Mac claims this “aggressive” advertising is part of the problem. “I work in digital and social media marketing, and I feel confident saying their ads are aggressive,” she said. “I was getting a Cerebral ad every four or five videos at one point on TikTok.” These ads, which Mac calls “misleading,” present Cerebral as a therapy service with hundreds of options for young people seeking help. On TikTok, where nearly 50% of users are between the ages of 10 and 29, that can present a problem. “Imagine being 18 and at college, or out of your parents’ house for the first time, and needing help,” Mac said. “At 18, you don’t necessarily know how to find a doctor through your insurance company. You might be intimidated by the red tape. So when an app advertises that they can easily match you with a therapist — of course it sounds like a good option.” It’s one of the big reasons Mac felt obliged to share her story on TikTok. What she found — that some users had faced similar struggles — was disheartening, but it also gave her hope that spreading the word could make a difference. Mac told In The Know she’s since found a better fit, a virtual therapist based in her home state of Massachusetts. Her hope is that other customers like her will manage to do the same. “One recurring comment I saw on my video was that many people just gave up trying to find a provider after their bad experience with Cerebral,” she said. “And I really, really hope that those people can find someone who can support them in an ethical way.” Run The World' star Amber Stevens West's minimalist skincare routine If you liked this story, read about how “StockTok” became TikTok’s biggest source for financial advice.
