12/16/2021,"A Texas teenager suffered multiple skull fractures after he was lured outside and beaten by his peers. When Cole Hagan, 16, regained consciousness he thought he had been in an accident and asked about his friends, his brother said. Three teens have been charged with aggravated assault and are each out on a $20,000 bond. A Texas teen was hospitalized after he was brutally beaten by his classmates in what his family called a ""bizarre"" and ""heinous act."" The classmates claimed the attack was sparked by inappropriate behavior toward women in their circle. Cole Hagan, 16, was at a pool party in Lake Jackson, Texas on December 3 when a few of his peers from Brazoswood High School told him that his truck had been hit, according to a police affidavit. Once outside, Hagan was ambushed by his varsity football teammate 17-year-old Reid Mitchell, who had planned the attack for several days, according to witness statements given to police. Logan Huber, another student accused of being involved in the attack, told police that he witnessed ""Reid Mitchell punch (Cole Hagan), bear hug him, slam him to the ground and then get on top of him and elbow him in the face,"" according to the affidavit. Mitchell then called one of Hagan's friends, saying ""come get your boy."" Two of Hagan's friends found him ""laying in the street bleeding from his ears,"" per the affidavit. Mitchell was charged with aggravated assault and is out on a $20,000 bond. Huber, 18, and Ayden Holland, 17, who are both accused of luring Hagan outside of the pool party, have also been charged with aggravated assault and are out on bail. According to police documents, at least eight other students were reportedly aware of the planned attack before it happened. ""At this juncture, we believe the identity of all those involved has been established and other charges are pending,"" according to a statement from the Lake Jackson Police Department. A spokesperson for the department told Insider that they could not provide additional details due to the active investigation. After Hagan was initially assaulted, he was transported to Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston. With multiple brain bleeds and skull fractures, as well as a broken collarbone, Hagan was placed on a ventilator. When he regained consciousness, Hagan thought he had been in an accident, and the first thing he did was ask if his friends were okay, his 36-year-old brother Cory Hagan told Insider. Hagan's brother described him as someone who ""loves his friends"" and ""would do anything for them."" ""That right there killed me because that's who he is, and that's why it made this thing so heinous,"" Hagan's brother said. ""They chose the weakest link. They chose the person that they had to lure outside to fight because he was not a kid that if you called him out, he was going to come out there and fight you in the yard."" As of Wednesday, Holland is the only suspect who has retained a lawyer, a spokesperson from the Justice of the Peace's office told Insider. Mitchell's parents did not respond to Insider's requests for comment. ""I've cried so much over the past week,"" Hagan's brother said. ""Now, I'm focused on him getting better. I'm focused on doing our part to hold these people accountable."" He said he believes there is a video of the assault and has offered a reward to whoever turns it over to the police. Hagan's brother initially offered a $1,000 reward, but as several people offered to pitch in to make it more lucrative, the reward has risen to about $25,000. ""I would be surprised if nothing was videoed, but if it was videoed, I think the only people that had it are the ones that could get in trouble if it aired,"" Hagan's brother said. In his statement to police, Mitchell said there had been ""a build-up of animosity"" between himself and Hagan due to the Hagan's ""perceived behavior to some of their female acquaintances."" Mitchell said Hagan had been ""caught"" with a friend's girlfriend and ""nothing happened,"" but then ""he went and did it again with Mitchell's girlfriend."" At the party, Mitchell had been sent photos of his girlfriend with Hagan, according to his police statement. He said he then confronted Hagan and ""told him that he hadn't learned yet because he had done it so many times."" Then, he threw Hagan to the ground, hitting him multiple times, Mitchell told police. After making their initial statements to police, Holland and Huber returned to the police department ""to make a new statement due to leaving information out of their first statement,"" police documents say. Holland said Mitchell was upset because Hagan had been ""messing with a friend's girlfriend and then started texting with Mitchell's girlfriend. Holland also mentioned about a girl claiming that (Hagan) had sexually assaulted her,"" according to the affidavit. Holland's lawyer did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Huber in his second interview claimed that Hagan was ""acting inappropriately towards women, including Mitchell's girlfriend and his behavior even went as far as sexual assault on an unknown person."" Evidence of such claims were not provided in the affidavit. Lake Jackson police could not confirm whether they were investigating the claims due to the ongoing investigation. Hagan's brother charged the suspects with ""just trying to pass the buck and avoid accountability"" with their claims about inappropriate behavior, saying they are not ""just repulsive, but more importantly, they're false."" ""You're making up lies about a good kid who was completely assaulted and taken off guard,"" Hagan's brother said. ""Even if my brother had done that, which I can assure you he did not... Newsflash to Reid Mitchell â€“ still against the law to do what he did."" He added, ""Cole is the most passive guy you'll ever meet, even with girls, even in football."" Hagan's brother said he spoke with his brother's friends about the incident and the claims made against Hagan. ""When I called his friends, (one of them) said it was consensual. They liked each other. They were talking to each other on Snapchat,"" Cory said. ""A boy's dating a girl, they break up, the girl finds somebody else, they mess around or whatever, and the guy gets mad."" ""These high school boys and young men, they feel like they own these girls that they date, even when they break up,"" Hagan's brother added. ""They think they can tell them who they can take a picture with and who they can stand with and who their next boyfriend can be."" A spokesperson for Brazoswood High School did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but the school told parents in a letter that the student who perpetrated the attack ""will not be on campus."" ""We expect our students, staff and Brazoswood community to come together to help support the victim and family. Any retaliation or threats will not be tolerated, and students will be charged to the fullest extent of the law,"" Brazoswood ISD said in a statement obtained by ABC 13. ""We haven't received one apology from any of the parents or any of the young adults that were involved in it. There's not been one ounce of remorse,"" Hagan's brother added. Hagan, a high school junior, had hopes of playing college football, but he'll ""probably never play football again,"" his brother said. After a week in the intensive care unit, Hagan was moved to rehab, where his speech and mobility have continued to improve. Even so, his family is uncertain about whether he will make a full recovery. ""After you have skull fractures like that, the last thing you need is to strap on a helmet and go bang your head into somebody else's,"" Hagan's brother said. ""He's going to have to protect his head, which is heartbreaking. That was his number one passion."" Hagan's brother said that while he is grateful for the progress made in the investigation of his brother's attack, he and his family's primary focus is to help Hagan recover. ""Lake Jackson Police Department has already made three arrests,"" he said. ""We expect more arrests to be made. But things are moving in the right direction and we're grateful for that. As upset as we have been about the attack on our family member, we're equally as grateful for the progress he's made and all the support."" Hagan's brother continued: ""I've cried so much over the past week that it's like ... Now I'm focused on him getting better.""

12/16/2021,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Omicron multiplies faster in airways, slower in lungs Major differences in how efficiently Omicron and other variants of the coronavirus multiply may help predict Omicron's effects, researchers said on Wednesday. Compared to the earlier Delta variant, Omicron multiplies itself 70 times more quickly in tissues that line airway passages, which may facilitate person-to-person spread, they said. But in lung tissues, Omicron replicates 10 times more slowly than the original version of the coronavirus, which might contribute to less-severe illness. A formal report of the findings is under peer review for publication and has not been released by the research team. In a news release issued by Hong Kong University, study leader Dr. Michael Chan Chi-wai said, ""It is important to note that the severity of disease in humans is not determined only by virus replication"" but also by each person's immune response to the infection, which sometimes evolves into life-threatening inflammation. Chan added, ""By infecting many more people, a very infectious virus may cause more severe disease and death even though the virus itself may be less pathogenic. Therefore, taken together with our recent studies showing that the Omicron variant can partially escape immunity from vaccines and past infection, the overall threat from Omicron variant is likely to be very significant."" Omicron grips cells more tightly, withstands some antibodies A structural model of how the Omicron variant attaches to cells and antibodies sheds light on its behavior and will help in designing neutralizing antibodies, according to researchers. Using computer models of the spike protein on Omicron's surface, they analyzed molecular interactions occurring when the spike grabs onto a cell-surface protein called ACE2, the virus's gateway into the cell. Metaphorically, the original virus had a handshake with ACE2, but Omicron's grip ""looks more like a couple holding hands with their fingers entwined,"" said Joseph Lubin of Rutgers University in New Jersey. The ""molecular anatomy"" of the grip may assist in explaining how Omicron's mutations cooperate to help it infect cells, Lubin added. The research team also modeled the spike with different classes of antibodies trying to attack it. The antibodies attack from different angles, ""like a football team's defense might tackle a ball carrier,"" with one person grabbing from behind, another from the front, Lubin said. Some antibodies ""appear likely to get shaken off"" while others are likely to remain effective. Booster vaccines raise antibody levels, resulting in ""more defenders,"" which might compensate to some extent for ""a weaker grip of an individual antibody,"" Lubin said. The findings, posted on Monday on the website bioRxiv ahead of peer review, need to be verified, ""particularly with real-world samples from people,"" Lubin said. ""While our molecular structure predictions are by no means a final word on Omicron, (we hope) they enable a faster and more effective response from the global community."" Four in 10 infected people may unknowingly spread virus Infected people who show no symptoms might be contributing significantly to transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, given that they account for 40.5% of confirmed infections worldwide, according to a study published online Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. The researchers pooled data from 77 earlier studies involving a total of 19,884 individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. They found that among infected people in the general community, about 40% were asymptomatic, as were 54% of infected pregnant women, 53% of infected air or cruise travelers, 48% of infected nursing home residents or staff and 30% of infected healthcare workers or hospitalized patients. The pooled percentage of asymptomatic infections was about 46% in North America, 44% in Europe and 28% in Asia. ""The high percentage of asymptomatic infections highlights the potential transmission risk of asymptomatic infections in communities,"" wrote Min Liu and colleagues at Peking University in China. Officials should screen for asymptomatic infections, and those who are identified ""should be under management similar to that for confirmed infections, including isolating and contact tracing.""

Former President Donald Trump's niece Mary Trump shared her theory Monday night: Don Jr. was afraid. ""Why was your cousin Don Jr. texting Mark Meadows on Jan. 6 instead of calling his dad?"" Lawrence O'Donnell asked Ms. Trump on his MSNBC show Last Word. ""I wish that the answer you had given was the right one â€” caller ID,"" she said with a smile. ""But in this particular instance, it's simply cowardice because Donnie knew the message he was sending was a message his father did not want to hear."" Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP/Shutterstock Donald Trump Jr. In recommending that Meadows be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify before the House committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol, investigators read text messages the former White House chief of staff received from several Trump allies, including Fox News hosts and the president's son, Don Jr. RELATED: Donald Trump Jr. Pleaded with Mark Meadows to Urge His Father to Stop Capitol Insurrection, Texts Reveal ""He's got to condemn this s--- ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough,"" one text said. ""We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand,"" read another, according to Rep. Mary Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee. Evan Vucci/AP/Shutterstock From left: Donald Trump, Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump Jr. Although there is no indication whether Don Jr. also reached out to his father or not, it's clear that the president's son believed Meadows was someone who could persuade the commander in chief to act. ""The question I have is how much was Mark Meadows pushing hard to get the truth to Donald, and my guess is not very hard at all,"" Mary Trump, 56, told O'Donnell. RELATED: Mary Trump Says Uncle Won't Run in 2024 Because He Can't 'Lose Like This Again' The committee made its case for charging Meadows, 62, in a 51-page document released Sunday, in connection with his decision to end cooperation â€” including failing to show up for a deposition â€” with the House committee after he initially provided reams of documents related to the attack and planning events that preceded it. ""Mr. Meadows was one of a relatively small group of people who witnessed the events of January 6 in the White House and with then-President Trump,"" the lawmakers said in their report. ""Mr. Meadows was with or in the vicinity of then-President Trump on January 6 as he learned about the attack on the U.S. Capitol and decided whether to issue a statement that could stop the rioters."" O'Donnell raised the point with Mary Trump that everyone who was sending urgent texts to Meadows during the attack â€” including Republican members of Congress and Fox News' Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity â€” ""all believed that it was within Donald Trump's power to stop the attack on the Capitol just by getting out there and saying something to the country, as Donald Jr. suggested, from the Oval Office."" RELATED: Donald Trump Sues His Niece-Turned-Nemesis and The New York Times for $100M Over Tax Investigation Mary Trump agreed and said his allies knew the president could quell the violence. ""What they also knew though was that even though a horrific situation had gotten out of hand, they were directly responsible for creating it, as was Donald, and he was reveling in it,"" she said.
