5/20/2022,"A former Russian colonel openly criticized the Ukraine war on state TV on Monday. Mikhail Khodaryonok told his co-hosts and viewers not to take ""information tranquilizers."" On Thursday, he was boasting about Russia's military strength and downplaying western weapons. A retired Russian colonel and current defense columnist who openly criticized the country's military campaign on state TV earlier this week reversed course in a new segment, boasting about Russia's military might. On Monday, Mikhail Khodaryonok urged viewers to not accept the Russian state's narrative about the war at face value. By Thursday, Khodaryonok had changed his tune. Instead of criticizing Russian logistical failures, he bragged about Russia's military might and condemned western-made weapons. ""When a country buys Western-made equipment, sometimes it malfunctions or stops working, right in the middle of the battle,"" he said Thursday on Russia's notoriously monitored state media. ""Our arms we supply to our buyers are different in their reliability, you get exactly the weapons described."" ""I just want to say: don't rush, don't rush,"" Khodaryonok said. ""The Russian Federation is yet to utilize even one-tenth of its military-economic potential."" —Julia Davis (@JuliaDavisNews) May 19, 2022 Earlier in the week, Khodaryonok appeared with a panel of guests and was surprisingly frank in his criticism of the professionalism and logistical failures of the Russian military. ""First of all, I must say, we should not take information tranquilizers,"" Khodaryonok told a panel on Monday, referring to reports about low morale in Ukraine's army. ""All of that, put mildly, is false."" In Monday's appearance, he also ridiculed Russia's threats against Finland after it applied to join NATO. Last week, the long-neutral Scandinavian country signaled its readiness to apply to NATO amid Russia's invasion. ""Don't saber-rattle,"" Khodaryonok said in his appearance, referring to Russia's threats to attack Finland. ""Don't engage with saber-rattling with missiles in Finland's direction,"" adding that it's such a poor tactic that it's almost ""amusing."" Khodaryonok on Monday urged viewers ""to maintain a sense of military-political realism."" On Thursday, he instead aimed a critique at Ukrainian politicians who he claimed were celebrating military gains prematurely.

5/20/2022,"A photo taken in Bucha in April showed a group of Ukrainian men who appeared to have been executed. A NYT investigation showed the men were in custody of Russian troops before apparently being killed. A video showed the Ukrainian captives being marched in a single file and flanked by Russian troops. Videos from Bucha, Ukraine, appeared to show a group of Ukrainian captives being led at gunpoint by Russian troops moments before they were executed. The videos, obtained and verified by The New York Times, were taken on March 4 by a security camera and a civilian who witnessed the ordeal. The security camera footage showed a group of nine Ukrainians hunched over, holding the pants of the person in front of them and some with their hands placed over their heads, crossing a street in a single file. Two Russian soldiers with guns can be seen at the front and back of the group, directing the line. Eight witnesses told The Times the captives were then taken behind an office building, gunshots were heard, and the group did not reappear. Additional drone footage obtained by The Times confirmed the witness accounts, showing the groups' bodies beside an office building as Russian soldiers stood over them. The videos were not independently verified by Insider. The group of apparently executed men from the videos were also seen in a photo taken April 3. The Times said its investigation, published Thursday, uncovered the ""clearest evidence yet"" that Russian forces intentionally executed the group, ""directly implicating these forces in a likely war crime."" Reports of atrocities and executions poured out of Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, after Russian forces began retreating in late March. Stories and images from Bucha fueled international calls for a war crimes trial against Russia. Russian officials have repeatedly dismissed reports of atrocities committed in Bucha, calling them ""fake.""
