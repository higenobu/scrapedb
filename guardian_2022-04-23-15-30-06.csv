4/23/2022,"At 2pm on 24 April 1932, hundreds of rebellious ramblers descended on Kinder Scout, Derbyshire’s highest point, to “take action to open up the fine country at present denied us”. Six people were arrested at what became known as the Kinder mass trespass, which established the principle of open access land and laid the foundations for the UK’s first national park, the Peak District. At noon this Sunday, exactly 90 years on from that historic victory, a group of swimmers from across the north of England plan to plunge into Kinder reservoir for what they describe as “an act of defiance against widespread lack of undisputed access to inland open water in England and Wales, and the disconnect this causes between people, water, and each other”. All are welcome at the mass swimming trespass, whether for a paddle or a leisurely swim; in a cossie, a wetsuit or even birthday suit. But with water temperatures unlikely to be much above 10C – a swimming pool is usually heated to 26-28C – caution is advised for anyone planning to take part. The Manchester Guardian had a correspondent booted up for the original mass trespass. They reported a “brief but vigorous hand-to-hand struggle” with a series of gamekeepers employed by the wealthy landowners, who tried and failed to stop the walkers asserting their right to roam. One of the organisers of the Kinder “swimpass”, who asked not to be named, said they were not expecting arrests, nor tussles with anyone employed by United Utilities, which owns the reservoir. Though the firm operates a blanket no-swimming ban, and last year blamed wetsuited wild swimmers for setting a bad example to novices, the laws around reservoir access in England and Wales are disputed and rarely, if ever, get tested in the courts. According to the Open Water Swimming Society (OSS), “There is a strong argument based on detailed research by many organisations and campaigns that there is a ‘public right of navigation’ on all rivers that can be navigated by any sort of boat, and therefore a right to swim.” Despite this, United Utilities and other companies have in recent years employed security guards in hi-vis tabards to order swimmers out of the water and to scare would-be dippers away. The OSS argues that water companies have a statutory duty to provide recreational access to waterways, not just for angling and dog walking but also swimming. In Scotland, swimmers have since 2003 enjoyed a right to swim freely in almost all Scottish reservoirs. Sunday’s swimming trespassers will be cheered on from afar by Catherine West MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on swimming. “I think as an awareness-raising campaign it sounds like a good way of getting everybody to take more note of how clean or otherwise the waterways are, and also of campaigning for constant improvements to our outdoor swimming opportunities,” said West, who swims regularly at Hampstead ponds near her north London constituency. She wants to see better swimming education for children so that they grow into adults who understand the risks of swimming in open water. People choosing to swim outdoors, who are not under the influence of alcohol and do not jump in, make up a small fraction of UK drownings, the OSS notes. One of the organisers of Sunday’s Kinder swim said they were optimistic that the narrative was changing around access to open water after more people discovered the endorphin highs of wild swimming during Covid. “It’s 90 years since the trespass that triggered a series of events that led to us having the right to roam freely, off the footpath. It opened up the huge landscapes to people from industrial cities, enabling workers from Sheffield and Manchester in particular to come out and get fresh air and all the benefits of getting up high on the hill and enjoying the countryside,” they said. “The benefits of open water are very similar.” Covid, they added, had “opened the floodgates” as more people had discovered “this untapped resource on the doorstep of millions of people”.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The right to swim: mass trespass of Kinder reservoir planned,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/23/kinder-reservoir-mass-trespass-swimpass-peak-district-wild-swimmers
4/23/2022,"One pet peeve of mine is needing to have a complex and nuanced opinion about something, so I am particularly annoyed at Channel 4 this week, who made me do just that. Nobody wants me to do this, Channel 4! Nobody wants me to explore the liminal space between “good” and “bad”. And yet, with A Very British Job Agency, I am going to have to! You’re going to ruin a lot of people’s Saturdays with this! Anyway, A Very British Job Agency (Monday 25 April, 11.05pm, Channel 4). You get it: a three-parter about a British job agency, with larger-than-life characters doing a very normal job in a slightly too enthusiastic way. The running theme of AVBJA is that the employment landscape is in tatters post-Covid and recruitment agencies – labelled the “fourth emergency service” by the narration, a label I can only assume was entirely self-applied – are the only ones brave and talented enough to solve it. If, like me, you started your career by trying to get employment agencies to help you, you will already be laughing. First, let’s start with the good: the two main characters, new-ish couple Sarah (long nails, cool mum, really big set of keys) and Rich (big vape rig, BMW he can’t elegantly get out of) are a likable duo whose sex lives I know too much about and whose hearts are in the right places. Sarah comes up against the constant frustrations of young people, new out of school and newer to work, letting her down when she arranges easy first-day lay-ups for them. Rich spends his life phoning factories to see how many of the workers he sent for an induction shift actually turned up. I get it: they want to help people! They are sad that life is leeching out of the local high street! This is a good thing, broadly! But then the bad: when trying to diagnose the UK’s employment issues, we only ever get to hear from embittered would-be employers, who are allowed to do a quick, “The problem with this country is no one wants to get off their arse and work!” to camera without being challenged. A factory boss can’t believe no one wants to do a 1am shift at a place you can barely get to without your own car. The boss of a travelling festival doesn’t know why young people don’t want to schlep to a field to do one five-hour bar shift for no tips. The family who run a campsite want fully trained chefs to work temporarily all summer for minimum wage. What’s the problem with this country and work? Is it that nobody wants to get off their arse and work? Is that really all it is? This series becomes frustrating when a lot of opinions about young people and work are parroted over and over again – “They all want to be TikTok famous!” “Cut off their benefits! Hit ’em where it hurts!” – which overwhelms any attempt to paint a more nuanced picture of the employment landscape as it exists right now. We see a sweet 17-year-old do her first waitressing shift at a too-posh cafe and lose confidence in real time. We see another kid whose will-do attitude gets two thumbs up from Sarah when he first waltzes in, but whose anxiety gets the best of him on his first day. We see a 67-year-old cheerfully working 16-hour days across five jobs because “divorce is expensive”, which is heartbreakingly unfair and depressing. These go some way to showing what trying to get a job is like in the UK right now: how young people’s confidence and experienced workers in the hospitality industry have been wrecked by two years of stop-start lockdown; how it’s infinitely harder to get employment when you have any sort of history of not being employed; how employers want you to throw yourself against the rocks of shiftwork for the absolute least amount of money they can get away with. But why aren’t people in work? Repeat it like a panto audience: because nobody wants to get off their arse! The problem isn’t this series, exactly, but the fact that it shows a deeply infuriating social problem without any solution at all, then lets British people give their opinions about it, which are literally always wrong. Maybe it isn’t that nuanced, actually: it’s a good-enough TV show that makes me hate every single employer in this country. There. I’ve figured it out.

4/23/2022,"I’m a sucker for all potatoes, and jersey royals are currently flavour of the month. Their waxy interior and flimsy skins require little more than salt and butter, but this would be a pretty dull recipe column if I didn’t give you more than that. So here are two dishes that take their sweet, nutty flavour to the next level, with a jolt of tongue-tingling Sichuan peppercorns and a drizzle of mouth-puckering tamarind. For maximum potato pleasure, eat these with the remote control in one hand and a fork in the other – couch potato heaven! The joy of these potatoes is in the mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns found hidden in their crisp crevices. Prep 15 minCook 1 hrServes 4 500g jersey royals2 tbsp rapeseed oilA handful of roasted peanuts, coarsely crushed1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds2 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal1 long red chilli, sliced on the diagonal For the sauce125g soft brown sugar15ml red-wine vinegar25ml light soy sauce1 tbsp black Chinese vinegar25g chilli bean paste or gochujangA thumb of ginger, peeled and grated2 fat garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns Steam the potatoes for 10-15 minutes or until tender, then take off the heat and let them cool a little. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Pour the oil into a roasting tin and heat in the oven for five minutes. Crush the potatoes with the bottom of a bowl – not so much that they fall apart, but just so you squash and flatten them and increase the surface area. Take the roasting tin out of the oven, toss the potatoes in the oil and then roast for 30 minutes, turning halfway until they are golden and crisp. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Put the sugar and 200ml cold water in a pan and heat gently until the sugar dissolves and turns into an amber caramel. Add the remaining ingredients, stir to combine and cook for four to five minutes over a low heat. Toss the potatoes in the sauce, coating them well, then arrange on a serving platter and top with peanuts, sesame seeds, spring onions and the red chillies. Serve hot.

4/23/2022,"‘The fascination of monarchy is that its themes repeat themselves because its protagonists are earthly,” is Tina Brown’s conclusion to The Palace Papers, her latest book about the British royal family. This is a very Tina Brown way of saying – after more than 500 exhaustive pages of Windsor arcana – “Oh well, we’re all human.” In fact, I think the fascination of the monarchy is that no matter how many books are written about them, and no matter how hagiographic they intend to be, there’s always some new information within that proves they’re even more repulsive than you originally thought. This is genuinely impressive – superhuman, even – given that the Windsor’s shenanigans are about as unexamined as the assassination of JFK. I’m no royalist – after all, I do work for the Guardian, which Brown describes as “mercurial” and “sour” due to its rude republicanism – but hey, I watched The Crown. I’ve even read Brown’s previous royal book about that similarly untapped subject, The Diana Chronicles. I’m up on the royals, OK? Or so I thought until I read in The Palace Papers about Charles’s other mistress in the 1970s and possibly 80s, Dale Harper, who was dropped by Charles for being too keen on him. Later she fell out of a window and was paralysed below the waist. When she “frantically pursued Charles in her wheelchair” at a polo match in 1997, he issued “a chilly statement saying they were no longer the friends they once were”. Or how about this one, which was told to Brown by “an American media executive” about the time he had lunch with Sarah Ferguson in 2015: “Andrew came in and sat down and said to me, ‘What are you doing with this fat cow?’ I was so stunned by his level of sadism. She has to sing for her supper.” In other words, Brown concludes: “He bails her out when she’s in trouble, and she backs him up when he’s assailed by scandal.” Brown gets in an even more satisfying dig at Andrew by making good use of the unpublished memoir of Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was forced by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with Andrew three times. The first of these encounters, Giuffre writes in her memoir, was “the longest ten minutes of my life”. (Andrew, famously, denies he ever met Giuffre.) Even the revered Queen is diminished by some of the claims. Most people know she went away for weeks at a time when she was a young mother. But I did not know that, after a six-week trip to Malta when he was 12 months old, “instead of rushing straight back to see Charles at Sandringham as one might expect, she lingered in London for a few days, catching up on admin and attending an engagement at Hurst Park Races where she had a horse riding,” Brown writes. She missed both Charles’s second and third Christmases and his third birthday. Really puts that modern parental guilt about going out two evenings in one week into perspective, doesn’t it? Yet Brown doesn’t want her readers to hate the royals, which is always the problem with books about them. The royals, like celebrities, only matter as much as people believe they matter, and a book just about Andrew’s awfulness and Charles’s pettiness would be true, but would also make the reader question just why they are reading about this absurd, irrelevant family. Current events, however, are in Brown’s favour as they have enabled her to play a double game. So in The Palace Papers there are the Good Royals – the Queen, Prince Philip and the Cambridges – who are written about in prose worthy of Mills & Boon (“There’s a Mona Lisa quality to Kate,” Brown writes, presumably without throwing up on her own keyboard). Then there are the Bad Royals – Prince Andrew, Sarah Ferguson, the Sussexes – who get a thorough kicking. Prince Charles is neutral, the others non-existent. In other words, she’s pretty much sticking to the script of the palace’s current PR strategy, which has cut the deadwood adrift and focused the spotlight entirely on the Queen and the Cambridges. In regard to the Sussexes, Brown is assisted in her endeavours by Meghan Markle’s father, Thomas, who adds Brown to the long list of journalists to whom he has trashed his daughter. Brown duly rewards him by defending his indefensible behaviour, insisting that Prince Harry made Thomas feel “disempowered, perhaps even emasculated” when he asked his father-in-law to please stop talking to the press. And that’s another interesting thing about the royals: as bad as they all are, the bottom-feeders around them are even worse. For those who haven’t encountered Brown’s writing before, The Palace Papers provides all the greatest hits. There’s her fondness for introducing people with often baffling descriptions: “the galloping Major Shand”; “a blonde dazzler with amazing legs”; and – my personal favourite – “With her tumbling mane of red curly hair and vulpine networking skills, Rebekah Brooks was lethally successful at penetrating the political and media corridors of power.” There’s also her usual balancing act of being both an insider (one person is introduced to the reader as “my pew mate at Lord Lichfield’s memorial”), but also enough of an outsider to describe Prince and Princess Michael as “low-boil, money-grubbing embarrassment[s]”. It’s a pose she perfected as editor of Tatler, that monthly annual of poshos that alternates obsequiousness with objectivity, and as with Tatler, it’s not hard to detect where Brown’s sympathies ultimately lie: the sad state of the British upper classes in the early 2000s is exemplified, Brown suggests, by the sight of “Brigadier Parker Bowles on the London tube, strap-hanging in his morning suit”. You can’t write as much about the royals as Brown has without taking them seriously, and she absolutely does. Her writing becomes positively orgasmic when describing Kate’s alleged triumph in bagging William: “Kate did not wait eight years for any rich, connected man. She waited for the man – the future King William V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her Other Realms and Territories King, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith – Your Majesty to the rest of us.” She gives poor Prince Philip a death scene that would have made even Charles Dickens say: “Tina, mate, come on. Dial it down a bit.” But Brown is also an absolutely dogged researcher. A significant part of The Palace Papers seems to be gleaned from earlier, very well known books (Diana by Andrew Morton, The Insider by Piers Morgan, Diary of an MP’s Wife by Sasha Swire). Even so, she dredges up enough colour to enliven the outlines of this all-too familiar story. And by God, it’s familiar. Are there really any readers out there with the stomach to wade through details of Megxit again? More people still agog for the alleged fairytale of Prince William and commoner Kate? Anyone on the planet desperate for another rehash of Charles’s cruelty to Diana? The answer, of course, is yes. And that, really, is the most fascinating thing of all about the royal family.

4/23/2022,"Doctors and scientists have developed an artificial intelligence tool that can accurately predict how likely tumours are to grow back in cancer patients after they have undergone treatment. The breakthrough, described as “exciting” by clinical oncologists, could revolutionise the surveillance of patients. While treatment advances in recent years have boosted survival chances, there remains a risk that the disease might come back. Monitoring patients after treatment is vital to ensuring any cancer recurrence is acted on urgently. Currently, however, doctors tend to have to rely on traditional methods, including ones focused on the original amount and spread of cancer, to predict how a patient might fare in future. Now a world-first study by the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, the Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Imperial College London has identified a model using machine-learning – a type of AI – that can predict the risk of cancer coming back, and do it better than existing methods. “This is an important step forward in being able to use AI to understand which patients are at highest risk of cancer recurrence, and to detect this relapse sooner so that re-treatment can be more effective,” said Dr Richard Lee, a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and early diagnosis at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Lee, the chief investigator of the OCTAPUS-AI study, told the Guardian it could prove vital in not only improving outcomes for cancer patients, but alleviating their fears, with relapse “a key source of anxiety” for many. “We hope to push boundaries to improve the care of cancer patients, to help them live longer, and reduce the impact the disease has on their lives.” The AI tool may lead to recurrence being detected earlier in patients deemed at high risk, ensuring they receive treatment more urgently, but it could also result in fewer unnecessary follow-up scans and hospital visits for those deemed low risk. “Reducing the number of scans needed in this setting can be helpful, and also reduce radiation exposure, hospital visits, and make more efficient use of valuable NHS resources,” Lee said. In the retrospective study, doctors, scientists and researchers developed a machine learning model to determine whether it could accurately identify non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients at risk of recurrence following radiotherapy. Machine learning is a form of AI that enables software to automatically predict outcomes. Lung cancer is the leading worldwide cause of cancer death and accounts for just over a fifth (21%) of cancer deaths in the UK. NSCLC makes up nearly five sixths (85%) of lung cancer cases and, when caught early, the disease is often curable. However, over a third (36%) of NSCLC patients experience recurrence in the UK. The researchers used clinical data from 657 NSCLC patients treated at five UK hospitals to feed their model – and added in data on various prognostic factors to better predict a patient’s chance of recurrence. These included the patient’s age, gender, BMI, smoking status, the intensity of radiotherapy, and their tumour’s characteristics. Researchers then used the AI model to categorise patients into low and high risk of recurrence, how long a period they might experience before a recurrence, and overall survival two years post treatment. The tool was found to be more accurate in predicting outcomes than traditional methods. The results of the study, supported by the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the National Institute for Health Research, were published in The Lancet’s eBioMedicine journal. “Right now, there is no set framework for the surveillance of non-small cell lung cancer patients following radiotherapy treatment in the UK,” said study lead Dr Sumeet Hindocha, a clinical oncology specialist registrar at the Royal Marsden and Imperial College London. “This means there is variation in the type and frequency of follow-up that patients receive … Using AI with healthcare data may be the answer. “As this type of data can be accessed easily, this methodology could be replicated across different health systems.” The study is “an exciting first step” towards rolling out a tool nationally and internationally to guide the post-treatment surveillance of cancer patients, Hindocha added.",News/Society,AI tool accurately predicts tumour regrowth in cancer patients,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/23/cancer-ai-tool-predicts-tumour-regrowth
4/23/2022,"Thousands of people, including pensioners and the self-employed, are locked out of filing their tax returns, or applying for rebates online, after HMRC changed the way taxpayers sign in to its services. Until last month, they could access accounts after signing up through Gov.uk Verify, a government service that allows users to confirm their identity using a British driving licence or credit records. However, last month, HMRC unexpectedly withdrew from the service. As a result, people can now only access tax accounts via Government Gateway, which requires them to hold two acceptable ID options from a list including a UK passport, a recent payslip or P60, a tax credit statement or a Northern Ireland driving licence. HMRC advises those who can’t provide the required documents to submit their tax returns on paper, and to call its helpline for information about their tax status. Louise Wadley, who is self-employed, says she is now unable to complete a self-assessment form online because she has been barred from the account she previously accessed by Verify. “I do not have a UK passport and my driving licence was issued in England, not Northern Ireland, so I can’t get past the first stage of Government Gateway,” she says. “The very helpful HMRC call centre agent I spoke to was unaware of the change and advised me to file my return by post, even though they are trying to reduce the number of paper returns.” Gov.uk Verify was launched by the Cabinet Office in 2014 to allow users to access government services from a single account. To sign up, users provide their details to one of two approved organisations, the Post Office and a company called Digidentity, which check and verify their identity. The aim was to sign up 25 million users by the end of 2020. However, HMRC developed a rival authentication system in 2017 and, last year, the Cabinet Office announced its flagship system would close in April 2023. HMRC’s decision to scrap Verify a year early appears to have caught its staff and users unawares. The government’s Verify guidance and sign-in websites continued to list it as a portal to HMRC services for up to a week after it withdrew it, until Guardian Money intervened. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which holds driver records used for verification, initially told the Guardian that HMRC would use the system until next year. The 2023 deadline announced by the Cabinet Office was to allow time for an alternative system to be developed, but HMRC appears to have ditched Verify without a back-up plan. It told Guardian Money that it was working on increasing the range of acceptable ID, but could not yet accept a British driving licence because the DVLA would not allow it access to its database. According to the DVLA, officials only requested access last month and it is still processing the paperwork. To compound the problem, technical issues have left many users unable to log on to Government Gateway and, until March, advisers on HMRC’s community forum pointed them to Verify, instead. The move will have an impact on pensioners and young people who don’t have employer payslips, and on foreign nationals who can’t provide a UK passport. Loic Baron, who is French, has been trying to set up a tax-free childcare account, using HMRC’s Gateway, since moving to the UK in 2020. “Registration requires a UK passport, which I don’t have,” he says. “I have had to apply by phone, involving many calls, and waits of about half an hour, as a ‘digitally excluded’ person. Being a software engineer, I find it hard to believe that I fall into this category.” Derek Mullins* says his 17-year-old daughter has been unable to correct her tax status because she doesn’t have the required ID. “She has been overtaxed to the value of several hundred pounds and HMRC’s website told us that, to correct this, we needed to set up Government Gateway access for her,” he says. “Both a passport and a Northern Ireland driving licence are required. As we live in England, of course she was not able to oblige.” The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group says the change will have a significant impact on many users. “Taking away the Verify option is unhelpful, given there are issues with Government Gateway that remain to be resolved,” a spokesperson says. “The results of this decision seem somewhat at odds with HMRC’s drive towards digital.” HMRC told Guardian Money that those unable to access their accounts online could sort out their affairs via its helpline – despite an automated message warning callers of busy lines and long wait times – or by letter. This month it was revealed that HMRC responded to only 52% of correspondence within 15 days of receipt in February, compared with 88% before the pandemic. HMRC says: “Most customers can deal with us securely online and we are continually looking at how we can increase accessibility to Government Gateway without reducing protections. “We always provide alternative ways for customers to access our services where they cannot use Government Gateway.” * Name has been changed",Lifestyle/Money,HMRC locks out taxpayers from their online accounts,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/23/hmrc-locks-out-taxpayers-from-their-online-accounts

4/23/2022,"Veteran lorry driver Meng Hong has become an unlikely social media star in recent weeks. Since March, his short video talks about life on the road during Covid outbreaks on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, have won him millions of likes. Most of Meng’s videos had been about “spreading positive energy” as he wrote in his account description. But on 13 April, he began to complain about what happened when drivers transported goods to Shanghai. “After we have delivered food, we were quarantined [after we left] or locked down in Shanghai,” he revealed in an animated video tirade. As China’s most populous city entered a strict lockdown this month, local governments in neighbouring areas erected roadblocks and closed highways to curb potential spread of Omicron, leaving logistics chains woefully disrupted. “As long as you have had a trip to Shanghai, very few other cities would allow you to enter,” Meng complained. Drivers were now refusing to go there, he reported. The post resonated across China and is a microcosm of the uncertainty the world’s second-largest economy is facing right now. The ruling party’s zero-Covid policy has so far resulted in at least 45 cities experiencing some form of lockdown, and Beijing shows no sign of changing course on its effort to eliminate the spread of the virus. Last Sunday, inhabitants in the six urban districts in Wuhu, a city of 3.6 million in eastern Anhui province, woke up to a sudden lockdown after one student at a school tested positive the previous day. The officials say they operate on a three-word principle in tackling this kind of situation: fast, precise and tough. But the unpredictable nature of such a practice has inevitably led to economic losses as lockdowns have affected 50% of China’s total output, according to local economists. Chinese and foreign firms have been equally affected. According to a recent survey by the German Chamber of Commerce in China, only about 7% of German firms surveyed reported no impact in their Chinese business operations as a result of Covid-19. And factoring in the geopolitical tensions, one-third of the respondents said they were putting planned business or investments in the country “on hold”. “What companies need now are signs of stability,” the chamber said in a recent report that also urged leaders at the European Union to raise their concerns with Chinese decision makers. “Being in the middle of the current Covid-19 wave in China, the German business community strongly needs an indication of the direction of the government’s Covid-strategy, to minimise the severe impact on business operations and supply chains.” Beijing set its annual GDP growth target last month at “around 5.5%”, but this is looking increasingly like a tall order, economists say. In the past week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) slashed its forecast for the world’s second-largest economy this year to 4.4% as China begins to feel the implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well as the lockdowns. On Thursday, Nomura went further, cutting its forecast of China’s annual growth from 4.3% to 3.9% this year. With no relaxation of the severe containment strategy in sight, the Japanese firm said its baseline estimate is that China’s second-quarter growth would only expand by 1.8%. Consumption and net exports are two drivers of China’s economic growth, said Mary Lovely, head of the China programme at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington DC. “[But] when we look at those two drivers going forward, we see some serious danger signs,” she said, warning that China could experience a “growth recession” in the current quarter. A “growth recession” refers to an economy at slow growth but with rising unemployment. Delivering economic growth has always been crucial to the legitimacy of China’s ruling communist party. This is particularly the case in 2022 as the five-yearly party congress is to be held in the autumn. President Xi Jinping is expected to continue his rule, in an extraordinary break with previous norms. Stability – politically as well as economically – is key to Beijing’s rulers. But lockdowns, risk of disease, and uncertainty are dampening consumption and investment that could create jobs, Lovely added. According to China’s own data released this week, the economy has been experiencing headwinds since last month, when Omicron began to spread. The unemployment rate in 31 major Chinese cities reached 6% in March, a record high. Among those aged 16 to 24, joblessness hit 16%, reaching the highest level in eight months. Particularly among younger workers, unemployment is a matter of deep concern to the authorities as it fuels social discontent, said Lovely. “It also means lost experience for these future workers, and lower lifetime productivity and earnings. Training young people is necessary for China to continue to maintain healthy growth as the population ages.” But there is a bigger worry for Beijing. Last week, the IMF boss, Kristalina Georgieva, warned that China’s consumption is falling short. “Rather than moving money into public investments, move it into the pockets of people, so there is more dynamism coming from a consumption boom,” she suggested. For a long time, China has tried to build a consumption-driven economy. But economic data suggests China has yet to see a meaningful recovery in real household income growth since the first round of the pandemic in 2020, said Jinny Yan, chief China economist at ICBC Standard Bank. “This is now exacerbated by local lockdowns because physically people cannot go out to consume, and March retails sales data shows that even online sales have been hit hard by supply chain and logistical disruptions.” There’s no easy way out of the current zero Covid policy dilemma, Yan said. This means that consumer confidence would be expected to continue to weaken even with monetary and fiscal support. Additionally, structural issues in the Chinese economy still linger. “So there’s no silver bullet. Even if the current zero Covid policy would be eased, a high prevalence of Covid cases will still impact economic activity.”",News/Business,"Fast, precise, too tough?

4/23/2022,"The Halifax is “supersizing” its prize draw for savers for one month only and will be giving away £1.35m in June, including 10 top prizes of £100,000. It is the latest bit of encouraging news for longsuffering savers, who are starting to see interest rates creep up after the recent Bank of England base rate rises. With interest rates moving upwards, it is perhaps no surprise that easy access accounts are proving popular at the moment, as people are not locked in and can quickly move their cash elsewhere if higher returns become available. Halifax is one of Britain’s biggest savings providers and runs a monthly premium bond-style prize draw for savers with at least £5,000 stashed away. The bank says that in June, “in celebration of its 10-year anniversary” (although the draw was actually launched in 2011), it will increase the prize fund. Rather than the usual three top prizes of £100,000, there will be 10. In addition, only for June, another 10 prizes of £10,000 will be available. The usual draws of £1,000 (100 winners) and £100 (1,500 winners) will also take place. The draw is free to enter, although customers need to register – via the app, online or in branch – and there are various requirements. You need to hold a qualifying savings account (all Halifax and Bank of Scotland savings accounts are eligible, with the exception of children’s accounts) for a whole calendar month. To be in with a chance of winning in June, £5,000-plus must be in the account for the full calendar month of May. You also need to be 18 or over and live in England, Scotland or Wales. A series of Bank of England interest rate rises and competition between providers have combined to push up savings rates across the board, said Rachel Springall at the financial data website Moneyfacts. The average easy access account rate has risen from 0.25% in March to 0.33% this month, which may not sound a lot but is the biggest monthly rise for 15 years. Meanwhile, the average notice account rate rose to 0.67%, and the average one-year fixed-rate bond rate reached 1.06% – the first time it has breached 1% since April 2020. As interest rates rise, many savers may be keen to keep their money where they can quickly move it into an account paying more, Springall said. One of the top-paying easy access accounts is the Saver account offered by the US bank Chase, which pays 1.5%. However, to get access to this, you will first need to bank with Chase, which means holding, or taking out, one of its current accounts. You do not need a minimum deposit and you can have up to 10 Chase Saver accounts at any one time. Zopa has an app-only Smart Saver account that is offering 1.2% to those looking for easy access to their cash, while Tandem Bank has the Instant Access Saver paying 1.1%. For those willing to tie up their cash for 12 months, the top-paying one-year fixed-rate bonds were, at the time of writing, paying up to 1.96%. PCF Bank and Al Rayan Bank were among the providers offering this rate.",Lifestyle/Money,Halifax tempts savers with special £1.35m prize draw,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/23/halifax-tempts-savers-with-special-135m-prize-draw
4/23/2022,"Gun violence overtook car accidents as the leading cause of death among children and adolescents in the US in 2020, according to a report from the University of Michigan. The finding was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday as part of longer term research effort from the university’s Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention (IFIP). An analysis of mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed a nearly 30% increase in gun-related deaths among Americans up to age 19 between 2019 and 2020, the researchers said. These deaths include incidents of suicide, accidental shootings and homicides, with homicides outpacing the other two categories. The number of deaths from car accidents and gun homicides among infants, children and young adults has been growing closer since 2016. Drug overdoses and poisoning increased by more than 80% between 2019 and 2020, the researchers found, to become the third leading cause of death among this demographic. “We knew gun violence had increased but I was surprised by the level of increase for just one year,” said Dr Jason Goldstick, a researcher with IFIP and associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Michigan. “I can’t remember ever seeing that before.” The rise in shooting deaths among the nation’s youngest is part of a larger increase in homicides in that same time period. Gun homicides across the US rose 33% in 2020, according to the study. This increase was disparately felt by Black Americans, who despite making up 14% of the US population accounted for nearly half of the nation’s homicide victims, according to FBI data released in the fall of 2021. Although 2020 marked the first year that more children and teens were killed by guns than in car accidents, gun violence has been the number one cause of death among Black teenage boys over 15 for at least a decade, according to CDC data. And these teens weren’t dying in high profile mass shootings on school campuses or malls. Rather, many of them lost their lives in homes where guns were present and unsecured and in the neighborhoods they grew up in. One of the young people killed in 2020 was Andre Robinson Jr, who was 19 when he was shot in the back on 8 November while delivering breakfast to his girlfriend’s Oakland, California, home. Another was Aaron Pryor, a football player who was shot and killed in the same city on 27 September, less than a month after his 16th birthday. California teens told the Guardian in December 2021 the rise in shootings had rocked their communities. They expressed paranoia, sadness and hopelessness over the loss of their peers to gun violence, both as victims and as those caught up in the cycle of shootings. “We have to see that violence everyday. We can’t go outside and have fun without knowing that somebody just died out there. I just wonder, ‘Damn, who’s next?’” said Samantha Walton, a 17 year-old from San Francisco. “Nothing should be so serious to where everybody is just killing each other. We’ve got like little kids, sisters and brothers out here that don’t even make it to 18.” “These numbers are horrible, especially because these are such preventable deaths, but until very recently research has been chronically underfunded,” said Goldstick, the University of Michigan researcher. “Our ultimate message is that a public health approach to violence prevention can work, but only if you fill in the evidence base and to do that, you need funding.”",News/US news,"Gun violence becomes leading cause of death among US youth, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/us-gun-violence-leading-cause-of-death-youth
4/23/2022,"The Covid-19 pandemic brought on a surge of “zoom-bombing” as hackers and pranksters crashed into virtual meetings with abusive messages and imagery. Now, Zoom has agreed to a “historic” payout of $85m as part of a class-action settlement brought by its users, including church groups who said they were left traumatized by the disruptions. As part of the settlement agreement, Zoom Video Communications, the company behind the teleconference application that grew popular during the pandemic, will pay the $85m to users in cash compensation and also implement reforms to its business practices. On Thursday, federal judge Laurel Beeler of California granted final approval to the agreement which was first filed in July. The agreement was granted preliminary approval in October. The settlement stems from 14 class-action complaints filed against the San Jose-based company by users between March and May of 2020, in which they argued that the company violated their privacy and security. In one incident two years ago, the Saint Paulus Lutheran Church in San Francisco was hosting a bible study class in which most of the participants were senior citizens. However, shortly into the session, “Zoom allowed a ‘known offender’... to ‘Zoombomb’ the class,” according to a federal lawsuit that was filed in May 2020. According to the lawsuit, participants “had their computer screens hijacked and their control buttons disabled while being forced to watch pornographic video footages”, including images of child sex abuse and physical abuse. The host was unable to remove the hijacker from the meeting room and asked the participants to leave and rejoin the meeting, only for the hijacker to bombard the meeting again with graphic content. The incident left the host and the participants “traumatized and helpless”, said the lawsuit. In another incident that occurred in April 2020, participants who joined the virtual Sunday services at Oakland’s Oak Life Church via Zoom were bombarded with child sex abuse images. According to court documents reviewed by the Los Angeles Times, “The participants from that meeting, many of whom were trauma survivors to begin with, were left traumatized and devastated. “Oak Life Church was required to hire trauma counselors and establish support groups to assist its congregation in dealing with the resulting trauma,” the documents added. In addition to failing to prevent “Zoombombings”, the case’s plaintiffs have accused Zoom of unlawfully sharing data with authorized third parties such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn and misrepresenting the strength of its end-to-end encryption protocols. Mark Molumphy, one of the attorneys representing Zoom in the case, described the settlement as “groundbreaking” in a statement, adding that it would also “implement privacy practices that, going forward, will help ensure that users are safe and protected” According to Molumphy, paying users who submit claims will be eligible for 30% of the subscription payment they made during the class period and others will each receive approximately $29. There are around 150 million settlement class members, which include paying and non-paying users, and the compensation amounts may change, depending on how many claims are submitted. “In the age of corporate surveillance, this historic settlement recognizes that data is the new oil and compensates consumers for unwittingly providing data in exchange for a ‘free’ service,” plaintiff’s attorney Tina Wolfson said in a statement on Friday. “It also compensates those who paid for a product they did not receive and commits Zoom to changing its corporate behavior to better inform consumers about their privacy choices and provide stronger cybersecurity,” she added. As part of the settlement, Zoom has agreed to over a dozen changes to its business practices that are designed to “improve meeting security, bolster privacy disclosures and safeguard consumer data”, according to court documents. As part of those changes, the company is required to develop and maintain a user-support ticket system to track reports of meeting disruptions, a documented process for communicating with law enforcement regarding disruptions that include illegal content, a suspend-meeting button and the ability to block users from certain countries.",News/Technology,Zoom agrees to ‘historic’ $85m payout for graphic Zoombombing claims,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/22/zoom-settlement-zoombombing-lawsuit

In William Wyler’s sumptuous 1968 musical, Streisand (in her Oscar-winning film debut) owns the screen, committed to Brice’s comic pratfalls but capable of belting out the big, heartfelt numbers.

4/23/2022,"The US government has warned Solomon Islands it will “respond accordingly” if its security agreement with China leads to a Chinese military presence in the Pacific island nation. A visiting US delegation including Indo-Pacific security adviser Kurt Campbell delivered the message to the Solomon Islands prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, directly, the White House said, as fallout over the agreement continued to dominate the Australian federal election campaign. Details of the agreement have not been made public. But according to a draft version of the deal, it would allow armed Chinese police to be deployed at Solomon Islands’ request to maintain “social order”. It would also allow China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”, and Chinese forces could also be used “to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. In a statement, the Biden administration said Sogavare assured the US there would be no long-term Chinese presence on the islands. But the US would nevertheless “follow developments closely in consultation with regional partners”. “Solomon Islands representatives indicated that the agreement had solely domestic applications but the US delegation noted there are potential regional security implications of the accord, including for the United States and its allies and partners,” the White House said in a statement. “The US delegation outlined clear areas of concern with respect to the purpose, scope and transparency of the agreement. “If steps are taken to establish a de facto permanent military presence, power-projection capabilities, or a military installation, the delegation noted that the United States would then have significant concerns and respond accordingly.” The White House also committed to expedite the reopening of its embassy in Honiara. On Saturday morning the Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, refused to be drawn on when the government became aware of the agreement. It had been reported by the Nine newspapers earlier this week that Australian intelligence agencies first became aware in March, and played a role in leaking the draft of the agreement online. But the failure of the Morrison government to prevent the deal has been described by the opposition Labor party as the most significant foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war. Frydenberg would not say when Australia first knew of the pact between the Solomon Islands and China, saying instead that “we’ve known that this was always a risk”, adding that “we’ve known that there were discussions under way”. He also told Weekend Sunrise that the government could do little more to assist Solomon Islands, describing its existing aid as a “full court press”. The Coalition government continued to try and use the issue to paint Labor as soft on China, with Frydenberg describing a speech by Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, in 2019 as the “biggest story” of the day. Marles – who was campaigning alongside Jim Chalmers in Brisbane due to Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s infection with Covid – confirmed reports he had shown Chinese government officials a copy of a speech he gave at a Beijing university in 2019. “I made a speech in China where I criticised China and I wanted to make sure that the Chinese government were not at all surprised with what I was going to say,” Marles said. “The assertion made by the government is another desperate attempt to divert from their failings in the Pacific.” Senior Labor MP Tanya Plibersek said on Saturday morning that Solomon Islands’ security pact followed “years of neglect” by the Australian government. Asked what Labor would have done differently from the Coalition, she said: “We wouldn’t have trashed the relationship with our Pacific neighbours in the first place. “It is inexplicable that, having been warned about this, [prime minister] Scott Morrison didn’t say to his foreign minister, Marise Payne, I want you on the first plane to the Solomon Islands to talk this through.” The reaction to the deal in the Solomons has been mixed. Peter Kenilorea, the chair of the Solomon Islands’ parliament’s foreign relations committee and an opposition MP, described the agreement as only benefiting China. During a forum hosted this week, Kenilorea also questioned Sogavare’s contention that his government was entitled to reach the agreement as it was a sovereign decision. “I don’t think is a path we should take or that it is a path would benefit Solomon Islands,” he said. “I think the biggest winner here will be the People’s Republic of China, in terms of a foothold in the Pacific region.” He went on to say that “when it comes to security, especially in this heightened geopolitical environment, it is more than a national issue … the region is impacted, there are implications”. Another participant in the forum, leading Solomon Islands academic Dr Transform Aqorau, said it was concerning that no one outside the government had seen a copy of the signed agreement or been provided with any detail of its content, but said he did not see anything wrong with an agreement that bolstered the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF). But former Solomon Islands prime minister and current MP Danny Philip told the same forum that the agreement would help ensure Chinese assets were protected in the country, after Australian security forces that were deployed there failed to do so. His claims were rejected by Australian authorities.
