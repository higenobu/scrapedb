5/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Dennis Gartman says U.S. stocks are and will be in a bear market until a one-day “violent, downward movement” signals that prices have reached bottom.

Be less long. Try to be as conservative as one can be,” Gartman said. “He or she who loses the least shall be the winner.” People are still comfortable buying price dips in stocks, and until they give up on that approach and the market delivers a “three or four or 5% decline in one day and another washout, I’ll have to stay bearish,” he said. The traditional definition of a bear market is a drop of 20%. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index is down about 25% this year, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has fallen around 16%. Its biggest one-day decline in 2022 was -3.63% on April 29. Reduced Exposure Gartman, the former publisher of the influential “The Gartman Letter,” has been bearish for months. In January, he said stocks could face a decline of as much as 15% in 2022, and he reduced the equity portion of the university’s endowment by a range of 12% to 15% on Dec. 31. “Last February, I actually moved us out of 3% of our equities and moved us into 3% gold,” he said. “I’m comfortable with doing that.” The main reason for stocks’ declines, a phenomenon hitting markets globally, is central banks’ shift from very easy monetary policy to tightening to cool the hottest inflation in decades, he said. “It’s predicated upon the fact that the monetary authorities, especially here in the U.S., that have been so expansionary for such a long period of time are now being contractionary,” he said. “And they’re going to remain contractionary, trying to fight against the inflationary pressures that they themselves have engendered through their own expansionary policies over the course of the past near-decade.” The Federal Reserve last week raised overnight lending rates for the second time this year, the latest a half-point increase, and has made clear its intention to tighten policy further to tame inflation. Gartman in the past has said he was wrong about a bear market in 2021, when the S&P index rose about 27%. But this year, he said, the market will continue to see declines and volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, sometimes referred to as the fear index, “has not been that high yet,” said Gartman. “It’s up in the 30s. We’ll get it up into the 40s. Until then, it’s a bear market.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Major League Soccer Threatens to Replace the NHL as One of the Big Four U.S. Sports China’s Massive Community-Buying Industry Is Collapsing Germany Comes to Grips With Its Hard-Power Role in Europe Business Travel Rebounds as Execs Choose (Real) Face Time Over Zoom Putting an End to Heart Attacks by Editing Human DNA ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•9 hours ago,"Stocks Will Be in Bear Market Until a One-Day, 5%-6% Drop, Gartman Says",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-bear-market-until-one-191316193.html
5/10/2022,"Russia's economy has plunged into its worst crisis for almost three decades as the country is battered by Western sanctions, a leaked copy of the Kremlin's own forecasts shows. The Russian finance ministry is predicting a 12pc collapse in GDP this year, the biggest contraction since 1994 when it was shifting towards capitalism under Boris Yeltsin, the first post-Soviet president. A collapse would wipe out around a decade of economic growth. The leak will pile pressure on Vladimir Putin, who on Monday presided over a scaled-down version of Russia's annual Victory Day parade marking the end of the Second World War in Europe. Russia has been hammered by heavy sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine, which are about to be ratcheted up further as Brussels discusses a ban on oil from the country. It has left the Kremlin teetering on the edge of a default after it last week narrowly avoided a failure to pay foreign debts for the first time since the Bolshevik revolution a century ago. The Kremlin has yet to issue a public economic outlook, but the finance ministry’s figures – seen by Bloomberg – are more pessimistic than the central bank’s forecasts of a contraction between 8pc and 10pc this year. The International Monetary Fund expects an 8.5pc decline. The dire figures emerged as Mr Putin appeared at a Victory Day parade in Moscow. The president did not use a speech to formally declare war against Ukraine or announce a larger-scale mobilisation, continuing to refer to the conflict as a “special operation”. Krishna Guha, an analyst at Evercore, said Mr Putin “is wary of risking domestic support for the war through mass conscription”. Meanwhile, European officials are locked in talks over how to press ahead with a mooted buying ban on Russian oil and gas. The European Commission is reportedly mulling offering more money to landlocked eastern European countries to build support for a ban, which is facing stiff opposition from Hungary. Britain and the UShave already vowed to ditch Russian oil, and European countries are also seeking to wean themselves off gas supplies from Moscow. Russia’s central bank has repeatedly slashed interest rates in recent weeks after raising them at the onset of conflict. The cuts, aimed at driving spending, came despite a surge in inflation to 17.7pc. Speaking in late April, governor Elvira Nabiullina warned of a severe recession, soaring prices and severe disruption to Russia’s labour market. She said the Russian economy would likely then remain stagnant in 2023. Official figures showed Russia’s economy grew by 3.7pc in the first quarter, but Ms Nabiullina said this was a temporary boost driven by people stocking up on the goods. Russia’s economy shrank by 3pc during 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and 7.8pc in 2009 amid the global financial crisis. Business surveys suggest activity is continuing to contract as sanctions cause demand to dry up. Bosses are increasingly pessimistic about the conditions they face as they whittle down work backlogs amid falling orders. Companies are firing staff and trying to cut costs as they grapple with soaring cost inflation, according to the latest purchasing managers’ index data from S&P Global. Several of the world’s biggest shipping companies are boycotting Russia, piling further inflationary and supply pressure on the country. Survey data tracked by Goldman Sachs suggests Russian economic activity is stabilising at about 10pc below pre-invasion levels. “Overall, mid-term developments will depend on how effectively Russia can substitute imports and redirect (energy) exports,” said analyst Clemens Grafe. That's all from us today, thank you for following!

The pair confirmed the discussions in statements Monday. Discussions are advanced and a deal could be announced in the coming days, Bloomberg reported. Swedish Match has a market valuation of about $11.5bn (£9.3bn). Elon Musk said that analysts at Hindenburg should ""look on the bright side of life sometimes"" after they said there is “significant risk” his $44bn (£35bn) takeover deal for Twitter is priced again with a lower offer. The research house, which shorts shares in the social media, said that “multiple developments have weakened the company’s position” since the bid was announced, “threatening the current deal dynamic.” Shares have fallen as much as 4pc today. Interesting. Don’t forget to look on the bright side of life sometimes! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2022 The FTSE 100 has closed lower as tightening lockdowns in China added to investors' concerns about a recession amid the Bank of England's dour economic outlook last week. The index fell 2.3pc to record its lowest closing since March 16, with miners and oil majors Shell, BP leading losses as commodity prices retreated on demand concerns. ""The biggest concern that markets have at the moment about UK is that we're likely to see fewer rate hikes over the course of the next 12-18 months and much slower growth, but I don't think we're going to be unique in that,"" said Michael Hewson at CMC Markets. Warehouse workers at the Mini plant in Oxford are planning to strike this month after rejecting a pay increase proposed by their employers, logistics firm Rudolph & Hellman. Workers’ union Unite said 200 staff will strike on 10, 12, 17 and 19 May after 91pc of its members voted against the pay rise, with a 98pc turnout. The workers, made up of warehouse staff and shunter drivers, handle components for BMW and the strikes are expected to impact production at the Mini plant. The company offered a rate of £11.33 per hour for day shifts and £12.27 for late shifts, but the workers demanded £12.50 and £13.50 respectively. Noble and Maersk Drilling have offered to sell some of their offshore operation platforms to avoid a probe from the Competition and Markets Authority over their proposed $3.4bn (£2.6bn) merger, potentially smoothing the way for approval. The watchdog said it had “reasonable grounds” for believing the concessions might be accepted and it’ll make a further decision on the proposals to address competition concerns. The CMA initially found that the tie-up could increase operating costs for oil and gas producers in the North Sea. A final decision is expected by July 6. Rishi Sunak should reverse the National Insurance hike to “put money back into the pockets of people” amid the cost of living crisis, business leaders have said. Louis Ashworth has the story: The British Chambers of Commerce(BCC) called for an “emergency budget” including the reversal of the recent increase to National Insurance Contributions as part of efforts to reduce cost pressures on businesses. The business group said the Chancellor should also cut the VAT on firms’ energy bills from 20pc to 5pc for at least a year. Companies are facing cost pressures from a variety of corners, including rising prices for energy and raw materials, and a sustained elevation in freight transport costs. Shevaun Haviland, BCC director general, said: “The costs crises facing firms and people in the street are two sides of the same coin. If we can ease the pressure on businesses then they can keep a lid on the price rises being driven by surging energy bills, staff shortages and higher taxes. “Firms will then have the breathing space they need to raise productivity and strengthen the economy. But a change of course is needed now, if the government does not act immediately then rising costs will put our economic recovery in a stranglehold that will have repercussions for years to come.” That's all from me today – thanks for following along! Giulia Bottaro will take the reins from here. Software company Ideagen has agreed to be bought for £1.1bn, but said it is also still in talks with a second potential suitor. The business employs 5,000 people and counts seven of the top 10 accounting firms in the UK among its clients, as well as many of the world's biggest defence and pharmaceutical companies. The deal with Hg Pooled Management was announced this morning and values the company's shares at 350p each. But shares were trading higher than this after leaping 46.5pc, indicating that investors might expect a separate bid from France's Astorg. Ideagen said it was still in discussions with Astorg. Struggling sterling dropped to a two-year low for the third straight day as traders' mood turned increasingly negative on the economic outlook. In a volatile session that saw the pound briefly jump higher, sentiment remained overwhelmingly downbeat after the Bank of England warned the economy will contract in 2023. Weak export growth data from China compounded these fears, with Beijing's zero-Covid policy sending shockwaves through the wider global economy. The pound last was last trading down 0.2pc against the dollar at $1.2325, having dropped to its lowest since June 2020. Against the euro, it slipped 0.1pc to 85.53p. Shares in Tesla rival Rivian slumped more than 14pc in early trading this afternoon as some early investors got their first chance to offload shares. Selling restrictions on certain investors and insiders ended on Sunday, freeing up a sizeable chunk of Rivian's float for public trading. Shares have collapsed 82pc from their November highs. All eyes will now be on Rivian's two biggest corporate backers – Amazon and Ford – to see if they start reducing their stakes. Amazon owns about 17.7pc of Rivian, while Ford owns 11.4pc. Few on Wall Street expect Amazon to lighten its position, but Ford is a different story. CNBC reported over the weekend that Ford plans to sell 8m Rivian shares through Goldman Sachs. The European Commission is said to be considering offering more money to landlocked eastern European states in a bid to convince them to agree to a Russian oil ban. The measures are part of a wider package of new sanctions against Russia, but the size of the investment still needs to be agreed, Reuters reports. Another potential sticking point is said to be Cyprus' concerns about a proposed ban on the sale of real estate to Russians. The EU is also said to be watering down its sanctions by dropping a ban on EU tankers carrying Russian oil. That follows opposition from member states including Greece. Raising interest rates quickly may spare households an even bigger squeeze on living standards, according to a top Bank of England policy maker. Speaking to the Resolution Foundation think tank, Michael Saunders said he feared inflation expectations may take off unless the Bank acts firmly now. Mr Saunders was one of only three members who voted for an aggressive 50 basis point increase last week. The Bank raised rates by 25 basis points to 1pc. The MPC member, who steps down in August, warned that inflation was ""uncomfortably high"" and that failing to act swiftly ""could require a sharper adjustment in monetary policy... and result in an even worse outcome for real incomes and living standards"". The Bank of England is grappling with soaring inflation – which it forecast will top 10pc in inflation – as well as a slowdown in growth, as it warned the UK economy will shrink by 0.25pc next year. Wall Street's major indices slid at the opening bell as investors are gripped by concerns over the economic outlook. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the declines, dropping 1.8pc. The S&P 500 fell 1pc, while the Dow Jones shed 0.7pc. Britain has invested £2bn to forge ahead with its new nuclear deterrent amid the rising threat from Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Helen Cahill has more details: The Ministry of Defence has awarded contracts to BAE Systems and Rolls Royce to build the Dreadnought submarines which will replace the current Vanguard submarines carrying Britain's nuclear warheads. The third phase of the programme is projected to cost nearly £10bn in total and will deliver the first submarine for trials at sea. BAE and Rolls Royce are manufacturing four Dreadnought submarines, which will be the largest ever built for the Royal Navy. First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key said the continuous defence system would provide ""the ultimate guarantee of security"" for Britain over the next fifty years. The first submarine is under construction in the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard and is due to be delivered in 2030. BAE has described the project as ""one of the world's most complex engineering challenges"". The submarine will be 153.6 metres in length, equivalent to three Olympic swimming pools, and will be manned by 130 crew members. ​Read Helen's full story here The dire internal forecasts from Russia's Finance Ministry suggest the country could be on track for its worst economic decline since 1994. A 12pc contraction in GDP would be the deepest since the days of Boris Yeltsin, who served as Russia's first president after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin, who presided over Russia's faltering move to capitalism, was a controversial figure who came under fire for his handling of the country's economy, not to mention his erratic behaviour and heavy drinking. Made.com has snapped up online homeware platform Trouva in a bid to ramp up its growth plans. The furniture retailer said the deal will help expand its online marketplace business. Terms were not disclosed. London-based Trouva was launched in 2015 and has relationships with more than 700 boutiques across Europe. It will continue to operate as a standalone business, led by current bosses Alex Loizou and Dimple Patel. Made added that the acquisition means it will be able to ""avoid some"" anticipated investment spending on its marketplace business. It therefore expects capital expenditure of up to £18m for 2022, having previously forecast spending of up to £20m. Shares in Made jumped 4pc after the announcement. Bitcoin has slumped to its lowest level in almost a year amid a sell-off in cryptocurrencies as investors flee riskier assets. The world's largest digital coin fell as much as 4.6pc and was trading at around $32,800 – its lowest since July 2021. Most cryptocurrencies have come under pressure as fears about tightening monetary policy and a slowdown in global economic growth rattled investors. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned that unanimity voting on key policy areas no longer made sense if the EU wanted to move quickly. She told the European Parliament: ""I have always argued that unanimity voting in some key areas simply no longer makes sense if we want to be able to move faster. Or that Europe should play a greater role – for example in health or defence."" The EU chief also said that she would be ready to back treaty change where needed to deliver on EU citizens' ideas on the bloc's future. It comes amid divisions between members states over the EU's plans to block oil imports from Russia. An Apple executive has quit the company in protest over the tech giant’s demands that staff return to the office for three days a week. James Titcomb reports: Ian Goodfellow, Apple’s director of machine learning, told staff on leaving that he disagreed with the company’s insistence on staff returning to its Silicon Valley headquarters, according to technology website The Verge. He is reported to have said: “I believe strongly that more flexibility would have been the best policy for my team.” Apple staff must currently work at least one day in the office and from May 23, they will be required to come into work on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Staff will be able to work from home or in the office on Wednesday and Friday and work remotely for four weeks a year. The policy is stricter than many of those at Silicon Valley firms such as Meta, Google and Twitter, where staff have been told they can work remotely permanently or have been given more flexibility over when they work in an office. Apple staff have protested over the company’s demands and said that employees are leaving because of the requirements, but Mr Goodfellow is the most senior reported departure. ​Read James' full story here Wall Street looks set to continue its slump this afternoon as investors fear aggressive interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve, while a slowdown in China is fuelling recession fears. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the declines, with futures tumbling 2pc. Tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google owner Alphabet, Meta and Tesla were all down between 2pc and 3pc in pre-market trading. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.6pc, while the Dow Jones was down 1.4pc. Traders are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates by 75 basis points at its next meeting, after announcing a 50 basis point increase this month. Tech stocks have borne the brunt of the recent sell-off, as their returns and yields are discounted more heavily when US Treasury yields rise. Commodity trader Trafigura is investing in a project to develop the UK's first lithium refinery as it bets on surging demand for the metal used in electric vehicle batteries. Trafigura will invest in the plant, which is being developed by Green Lithium, and will also supply feedstock. The project aims to sell batter-grade lithium chemicals to electric vehicle makers across Europe, with initial production targeted for the end of 2024. Sean Sargent, chief executive of Green Lithium, said: The electric revolution is fundamental to reducing the carbon emissions that contribute to global climate change and ensuring net-zero targets can be met. Green Lithium’s refinery will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and sustainable energy storage through the increased supply of low-carbon, battery-grade lithium chemicals – a key component of lithium-ion batteries. China’s premier has warned its job market faces a “complicated and grim” outlook as the country’s zero-Covid strategy causes trade exports to plunge, writes Louis Ashworth. Li Keqiang warned of job losses as Beijing and Shanghai tightened curbs on residents as part of efforts to contain the pandemic. He instructed government departments and regional authorities to focus on measures aimed at helping businesses avoid shedding jobs. New figures released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics showed joblessness rose to 5.8pc in March, the highest since May 2020. Mr Li said: “Stabilising employment matters to people’s livelihoods, it is also a key support for the economy to operate within a reasonable range."" It came as data showed China saw a further trade slowdown in April as local lockdowns curb demand, hit production and spur logistics issues in the world’s second-biggest economy. ​Read Louis' full story here EU industry chief Thierry Breton will meet Elon Musk in Texas today to discuss global supply chain issues and new rules on policing online content. The pair will meet this afternoon in Austin, where his electric vehicle firm Tesla is headquartered. It comes weeks after the world's richest man secured a $44bn deal to buy Twitter. Musk has put free speech at the heart of his pledge to revitalise Twitter, but his comments sparked a response from Mr Breton that the platform must comply with the EU's new Digital Services Act tackling illegal online content. A spokesman for the EU chief said: Tech and supply chains will be high on the agenda at Tesla with Elon Musk. Free speech will also be on the menu between Thierry Breton and Elon Musk. So will EU regulation. Expect exchange on the Digital Services Act and how 'new' Twitter will play by European rules. The FTSE 100 has extended its losses in morning trading to mark a downbeat start to the week. The blue-chip index slumped 1.2pc, with the decline fuelled by China growth worries and the Bank of England's grim outlook for the UK economy. Miners were the biggest drag, with Glencore, Rio Tino and Anglo American all losing ground. Investors were already rattled after the Bank of England issued a warning over the double risks of a recession and inflation surging past 10pc. This was compounded by the slowest growth in Chinese exports in two years as Beijing's zero-Covid policy takes its toll. The Bank branch of the Northern Line will reopen next week after months of works that disrupted a key commuting route into the City of London. Transport for London confirmed services from Kennington to Moorgate will resume in full on May 16 after shutting down in January. The closure allowed for works to increase capacity at Bank station, which has been plagued by overcrowding at peak times, as well as making the stop more accessible for passengers with disabilites. Morrisons has emerged victorious in a battle to take control of failed convenience store chain McColl’s, snubbing the billionaire owners of Asda. The supermarket giant, which is owned by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, has seen off competition from petrol station operator EG Group after a dramatic bidding war over the weekend. The deal, which will be structured as a pre-pack administration, will ensure all of McColl’s stores and workforce is preserved, Sky News reported. McColl’s, which has a debt pile of around £170m, was left teetering on the brink of collapse after it fell into administration on Friday, putting 16,000 jobs at risk. Morrisons had been the frontrunner to take control of McColl’s last week before lenders rejected a rescue deal that would have seen £100m of debt rolled into the supermarket chain. EG Group, whose billionaire owners the Issa brothers also control Asda, launched a rival bid, which it later improved to cover funding for the company’s pension scheme. This prompted Morrisons to table a second offer last night that included a pledge to repay lenders in full immediately – a key sticking point in its original proposal. Natural gas prices declined this morning as Russia tried to reassure buyers that they can keep paying for gas without breaching sanctions. The market has been seized by supply concerns about Putin demanded that ""unfriendly"" nations pay for gas supplies in roubles. Poland and Bulgaria have already been cut off after they refused the demand. But in a letter seen by Bloomberg, Gazprom told European clients that a new order published by the Kremlin on May 4 “clarifies the procedure” set out in the initial decree on ruble payments for gas. It's not clear whether this will be enough to calm EU fears, however. Benchmark European prices fell 7.6pc, while the UK equivalent was down 9.4pc. BP is reportedly set to buy a stake in a $36bn (£29bn) green hydrogen project in western Australia and become its developer. The investment in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub could be announced within days, The Australian newspaper reported. The project aims to install 26 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity over a 6,500 square kilometre stretch of the Pilbara region. It's hoping to produce about 1.8m tonnes of hydrogen a year while plotting exports as soon as 2027. Sterling is continued its slide against the dollar after the Bank of England's grim forecast for the economy, while Sinn Fein's election victory sparked fresh Brexit worries. The pound slumped to its lowest in two years last week after the Bank warned the UK economy will contract in 2023 and forecast inflation at more than 10pc later in the year. Analysts also warned of tensions over the Northern Ireland border after Sinn Fein, whose ultimate goal is a united Ireland, became the biggest party in Northern Ireland's Assembly for the first time. The pound dropped 0.5pc against the dollar to $1.2287. Against the euro, it was down 0.1pc at 85.61p. ICYMI – Morrisons sought to gatecrash a takeover for failed convenience store chain McColl's last night in a snub to the billionaire owners of Asda who were on the brink of securing a deal. Gareth Corfield has more details: Morrisons, which is owned by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, has made a second offer to buy McColl’s that includes a pledge to repay its lenders in full immediately, one of the key sticking points of the supermarket’s previous bid, Sky News reported. PwC is understood to have last night taken final offers from Morrisons and EG Group, the petrol forecourt empire owned by the billionaire Issa brothers who are also behind Asda. McColl’s, which has a debt pile of around £170m, fell into administration Friday, putting 16,000 jobs at risk. Morrisons had been in pole position to take control of McColl’s last week before lenders rejected a solvent offer that would have involved them rolling over more than £100m of debt into the supermarket chain, but being repaid in full as the loans expired. Read Gareth's full story here Here's some more on the story behind Capco's share price movement this morning: Shaftesbury and Capital & Countries have confirmed they're in advance discussions to create a real estate giant that would own assets across some of London's most sought-after areas. The merger would create a REIT (real estate investment trust) focused on the West End, including Covent Garden, Carnaby, Chinatown and Soho. Under the proposed terms of the deals, Shaftesbury would own 53pc of the combined company, while Capco would own 47pc. Capco currently holds a stake of around 25pc in Shaftesbury. The two firms said Norway's sovereign wealth fund – a major investor in both – had backed the all-stock deal. Ian Hawksworth, chief executive of Capco, would lead the combined group, which could be worth around £3.6bn. The FTSE 100 has dipped at the open, following Asian markets lower as lockdowns in China added to investor concerns after the Bank of England's dire warnings last week. The blue-chip index fell 0.2pc in early trading, with miners leading losses as metal prices dropped on demand concerns. Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American were the biggest drags on the index. Rightmove was the largest faller, sliding more than 4pc after it announced the departure of its chief executive. Bucking the trend were energy giants Shell and BP, which rose amid ongoing concerns about an EU oil embargo. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 slumped 1pc. Capital & Countries dropped more than 6pc amid merger talks with real estate rival Shaftesbury. Activist investor Dan Loeb has boosted his stake in Shell amid booming profits for the oil giant. His hedge fund Third Point added to its position in the first quarter and also took a long position in miner Glencore, citing demand for copper and nickel for the transition to renewable energy. Mr Loeb revealed his stake in Shell in October and called for a break-up of the company, with its renewables operations separated from its legacy business. It comes after Shell reported that its profit nearly tripled to a record in the first quarter as it cashed in on surging energy prices. China's export growth has slumped to its slowest in almost two years as the fallout from Beijing's zero-Covid policy adds to global economic woes. Exports in dollar terms grew 3.9pc in April from a year earlier, dropping sharply from the 14.7pc growth reported in March. It was the slowest pace since June 2020. Imports were broadly stable year-on-year, improving slightly from a 0.1pc fall in March. The lacklustre figures show China's trade sector, which accounts for about a third of total GDP, is losing momentum as lockdowns in cities such as Shanghai hammered supply chains. The problems heighten the risk of a deeper economic slowdown in the world's second-largest economy and beyond. In corporate news this morning, Rightmove chief executive Peter Brooks-Johnson has announced he's stepping down after more than 16 years at the firm. The UK's largest property website said Mr Brooks-Johnson will remain in the role until its full-year figures are published in February 2023. The company is now starting the search for his successor. The Rightmove chief joined the company in 2006 and rose to the top job in May 2017. He was previously a management consultant with Accenture and the Berkeley Partnership. Shares slid 4.8pc following the announcement. Mr Brooks-Johnson said: ""With Rightmove progressing well on its mission to make home moving easier and our strong trading from 2021 continuing into 2022, I have decided it is an appropriate time to seek a new challenge."" Andrew Fisher, chairman of Rightmove, said: ""Peter has made a significant contribution to the success of Rightmove over the past 16 years and whilst we are disappointed that he will be leaving the business, we understand his decision."" The FTSE 100 has started the week in negative territory after a grim outlook from the Bank of England rattled investors last week. The blue-chip index fell 0.2pc at the open to 7,374 points. Japan has rallied behind its G7 allies in vowing to end imports of Russian oil, though it warned the move would take time. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said it was an ""extremely difficult"" decision, but that G7 unity was important. It's likely to have only a limited impact, given Japan imported only 3.6pc of its crude oil from Russia in March. Still, it will add to pressures pushing global energy prices higher. Japan also said it would retain its stake in the the Sakhalin 1 oil and Sakhalin 2 liquefied natural gas projects in Russia. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against Russia and Belarus – targeting £1.7bn of trade. The Department of International Trade said the new measures will target goods including platinum and palladium, which are used to make mobile phones and computers. Import tariffs will cover £1.4bn of goods, while planned export bans will hit £250m in sectors of the Russian economy most reliant on UK products, including chemicals, plastics, rubber, and machinery. It takes the total value of products subjected to British sanctions to more than £4bn. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Secretary of State for International Trade, said: We are determined to do our utmost to thwart Putin’s aims in Ukraine and undermine his illegal invasion, which has seen barbaric acts perpetrated against the Ukrainian people. This far-reaching package of sanctions will inflict further damage on the Russian war machine. It is part of a wider coordinated effort by the many countries around the world who are horrified by Russia’s conduct and determined to bring to bear our economic might to persuade Putin to change course. Good morning.  A top EU officials has proposed that the bloc should seize $300bn of frozen Russian foreign exchange reserves to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine. The West has taken control of around half of Putin's $600bn of gold and forex reserves, and officials are now considering how these could be used to support Ukraine's recovery. The seizure of foreign exchange reserves would be a dramatic move, but EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell pointed to the US decision to set aside $3.5bn of the Afghan central bank's assets to pay for humanitarian aid and compensation for victims of the 9/11 attacks. He told the Financial Times: “I would be very much in favour because it is full of logic.

5/10/2022,"Despite the Federal Reserve's increasingly hawkish stance, inflation continues to be a problem. In March, U.S. consumer prices rose 8.5% from a year ago, marking the biggest jump since 1981. Inflation erodes purchasing power. According to Shark Tank star and investment mogul Kevin O’Leary, that means keeping large sums of money in a low-interest savings account is a big mistake. “Right now in a bank account, you’re getting very little [interest],” he says in a recent interview with CNBC. “And inflation is over 6%. So you’re actually losing money every 12 months.” O’Leary suggests having three months of salary on hand in case of emergency. But after you've built that cushion, O’Leary recommends investing in index funds, which offer an easy and diversified way to get exposure to the stock market. Here’s a look at three index funds. Each of them focuses on different chunks of the market — own all three and you’re well diversified. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. The S&P 500 Index is widely regarded as the benchmark index for the U.S. stock market. Several funds track the S&P 500 in order to provide investors with convenient exposure to U.S. equities. But if a fund wants to use the S&P 500 name, it has to pay a licensing fee that essentially gets passed on to investors. The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund closely mirrors the performance of the S&P 500. But it’s not an “official” S&P 500 copycat, so it doesn’t have to pay the licensing fee. In turn, FNILX boasts an expense ratio of 0%. Every dollar you put into FNILX gets put to work. Small-cap stocks don’t get as much attention as their large-cap counterparts. But investors shouldn't ignore them. The largest companies we see today were once small. Companies with plenty of room to grow have tremendous upside. For a low-cost way to invest in this growth-oriented group, investors can check out Vanguard Small-Cap ETF. It tracks the CRSP U.S. Small Cap Index, which measures companies in the bottom 2%-15% of the investable universe. VB is diversified, holding around 1,550 stocks. It also has a low expense ratio of just 0.05%. One thing to keep in mind: Because small-cap stocks are relatively young, they tend to be more volatile than more established large-cap names. To truly diversify your portfolio — especially in this age of globalization — having some exposure outside of the U.S. is essential. Thankfully, it’s easy these days to invest overseas. For instance, Vanguard Total International Stock ETF seeks to match the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap ex-US Index. By owning this index fund, investors get broad exposure across developed, as well as emerging non-U.S. equity markets. The fund’s top holdings include global industry titans such as Samsung Electronics, Nestle, Tencent Holdings and Toyota. It also owns smaller names and holds over 7,800 stocks, with an expense ratio of 0.07%. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

5/10/2022,"What to make of the markets right now? Last week brought more losses in what’s been a volatile year for stocks. The five straight weeks of market declines marked the longest such streak in over a decade. More ominously, they came in along with a number of other disturbing data points. The April jobs numbers, released on Friday, came to 428,000 jobs added for the month, superficially strong and well above the 391,000 expected. But the labor remains depressed, and the total number of workers, even after a year of strong gains, is still 1.2 million below its pre-pandemic peak. Worse, the 5.5% wage gains in April, the fifth month in a row that wages grew more than 5%, did not keep pace with the 8.5% annualized inflation rate. Workers are getting paid more, but are still falling behind. On top of that, the high inflation rate has spurred the Fed to start boosting interest rates. The last increase, of 0.5%, was the largest increase in more than two decades, and is already being reflected in higher bond yields (the 10-year Treasury note is above 3%) and increasing mortgage rates. For investors, however, conditions are pointing toward bargain hunting – finding the stocks that are running cheap but with the potential for high returns in the long term. With that in mind, we’ve used the data at TipRanks to pull up three stocks that are showing 50% or greater losses for the year so far – but that also show Strong Buy ratings from the Street and the potential to double or more in the coming year. Here’s the lowdown. Kornit Digital (KRNT) We’ll start with a tech firm in the textile industry. Kornit bills itself as a global digital printing company, specializing in high-speed, industrial-grade ink jet printers, along with pigments and chemical products, for the garment, apparel, home goods, and decorating sectors. The company’s machines are capable of printing complex designs directly onto finished textiles, allowing fabric workers to call up patterned textiles on demand. This frees up inventory space and eliminates redundancies, important considerations for Kornit’s customer base. One number will suffice to show the scale of Kornit’s work and niche: there are more than 150 million garment designs printed every year on Kornit machines. The company coordinates this work through 5 global offices in New Jersey, Miami, Dusseldorf, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The company will report its 1Q22 financial results this Wednesday, May 11, but we can get a good feel for its current situation by looking back at the previous quarters. In the second half of 2021, Kornit saw solid revenue numbers, with the Q4 figure of $87.5 million being a company quarterly record. The full-year top line for 2021 was $322 million, up 67% year-over-year. The company was profitable, with a 2-cent GAAP earnings per diluted share in the quarter, and 13 cents for the full year. Despite these positive metrics, the company’s stock is down 58% so far this year. However, 5-star analyst James Ricchiuti, from Needham, doesn’t flinch from Kornit’s recent share price losses. In fact, he rates the stock a Buy, along with a $155 price target. The figure implies shares will be valued ~141% higher in a year’s time. (To watch Ricchiuti’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Ricchiuti writes: “We believe the long-term secular drivers that underpin our positive investment thesis on Kornit are intact... We believe business remains healthy, notwithstanding increased macro uncertainty. We still foresee strong tailwinds in KRNT's business in 2022 and 2023, driven by positive momentum with its largest customers, the growing near-shoring trend and emphasis on sustainability by apparel makers, along with a rich new-product pipeline."" Overall, with 7 recent positive reviews on file, Kornit’s stock has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating from the Wall Street analyst corps. The shares are selling for $64.19 and their $151.71 average price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~136%. (See KRNT stock analysis on TipRanks) Bill.com Holdings (BILL) The second beaten-down stock we’ll look at is Bill.com, a provider of cloud-based software solutions for the accounting and paperwork issues that threaten to overwhelm the small business world. The company’s cloud platform makes it possible for customers to automate day-to-day processes in billing, invoicing, receiving payments, and making payments, the constant bookkeeping tasks that eat up so much time for small entrepreneurs. Bill.com is popular among its target customer base of small and medium businesses, as evidenced by the company’s strong revenue growth in recent quarters. Earlier this month, the company released its financial results for fiscal 3Q22, and showed powerful year-over-year revenue growth of 179%, to hit a total of $166.9 million for the quarterly top line. Of that total, subscription fees grew 78% to reach $52.2 million, while transaction fees expanded by 286% to reach $113.3 million. Even though the financials were, on the surface, solid, the stock fell by a third after the release. Investors were somewhat spooked by a slowdown in revenue growth. Quarter-over-quarter, the top line expanded only 6.6%, a far cry from the 34% q/q growth in fiscal 2Q22. And looking forward, the company gave fiscal Q4 guidance in the range of $182.3 million to $183.3 million, which even at the high end would be q/q growth of less than 10%. To date this year, the stock is down 51%. Nevertheless, Canaccord’s 5-star analyst Joseph Vafi remains bullish. He writes of this company: “While no one knows the future of the macro right now, we see BILL as being relatively well positioned against the current backdrop, except for its standout valuation, which has clearly already come in materially. With over 70% organic and 179% growth overall in FQ3, no one can say the BILL model does not continue to work on what is a huge, long tail in small businesses that need help with their financial back offices. Also, with 80+% gross margins and a powerful 1-2 punch business model of SaaS subscription and payment volume based revenue, BILL remains the model to beat in SMB payments, in our view."" Along with these upbeat comments, Vafi gives BILL a Buy rating and a $250 price target, implying an upside of ~107% over the next 12 months. (To watch Vafi’s track record, click here) Wall Street would tend to agree with this bullish outlook – as shown by the 12 to 1 breakdown in recent reviews, favoring Buys over Holds and supporting a Strong Buy consensus view. The stock is currently trading at $121 and its 240.83 average target suggests an upside of 99% from that level. (See BILL stock forecast on TipRanks) DermTech (DMTK) Last but not least is DermTech, a leader in the field of molecular dermatology. Specifically, DermTech is developing and commercializing new diagnostic technologies for the early detection of melanoma. This is a common skin cancer, dangerous in itself and made more so by its propensity to metastasize into other areas of the body. Early detection of the disease is the key to successful treatment, and this is where DermTech is stepping in. The company has developed an adhesive patch melanoma test, which can take a non-invasive skin biopsy for medical testing. The company operates its own genetic testing lab where skin samples can be examined. And best of all, the DermTech test can be done by the patient, at home, rather than in a physician’s office. Like the other stocks here, DermTech shows a combination of sound revenues and falling share price. In its 1Q22 report, the company announced a quarterly top line of $3.7 million, up 47% year-over-year. The gain was driven by a 61% increase in assay revenue, which in its own turn was boosted by a 53% y/y increase in billable sample volume, to 14,730 for the quarter. The company did see a quarterly net loss of $1.01 per share – although it ended the quarter with a positive cash holding of $202.1 million. The stock has fallen, however, by 51% so far this year. Analyst Sung Ji Nam, of investment firm BTIG, sees the fall in share price as an opportunity to get in on this stock. ""DMTK remains well-positioned to more than double its revenues in 2022, barring additional significant COVID-related healthcare disruptions in the U.S. for the remainder of the year. Key growth drivers for 2022 and 2023 include the meaningful sales force expansion in 2021 that is expected to drive test volume growth, and DMTK's focus on test ASP improvement through further Medicare segment penetration, appeals management and further expansion of third party payor coverage,"" Ji Nam noted. In line with these bullish comments, Ji Nam sets a Buy rating on the stock and her $38 price target indicates potential for robust growth of ~393% ahead. (To watch Ji Nam's track record, click here) Overall, this small-cap stock has only 4 recent analyst reviews – but they are unanimously bullish, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $7.71 and have an average price target of $30.33, suggesting a 293% one-year upside potential.

5/10/2022,"U.S. stocks have had a rough start to the year after a standout 2021—and if history is any guide for what’s to come, things could get even worse from here. The S&P 500, which returned nearly 27% to investors last year, has been dragged down more than 15% year to date by rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation, and a number of other bearish factors. The big question on most investors’ minds: How much further will stocks drop? Bank of America’s chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett has looked backward, and he has a hibernation outlook. Based on historical bear market trends, he said, there could be months of pain ahead. “In the last 19 bear markets, the average peak to trough decline has been 37% with an average duration of 289 days. If history were to repeat then today’s bear market ends in October 2022 with the S&P at 3000,” Bank of America Research analysts wrote in a Sunday note. If that bears out, it means the S&P 500 still has another roughly 25% downturn ahead of it from current levels. Hartnett noted that in the past 25 years, the NYSE composite has always fallen significantly below its 100-week moving average during bear markets, but this year the index is trading just barely below that level, which could mean more downside lies ahead. While about half of the stocks in tech-heavy Nasdaq are down 50% or more from their peaks, and many speculative assets in the cryptocurrency space have seen sharp drawdowns in recent weeks, Hartnett argues Wall Street will spend much of the year working through an “inflation shock,” a “rates shock,” and a “recession shock” that will lead to negative returns and increased volatility. The “good news is bear markets are quicker than bull markets,” he said. The investment strategist added that while many investors have sought protection in commodities since the start of the year, he believes these holdings should be sold moving forward “given recession risk.” Hartnett isn’t bullish on the tech space, either, arguing that more speculative tech stocks will remain in a bear market for the next two years, even if the S&P 500 bottoms out. A floor does not equal a new bull market for tech stocks, he said. The investment strategist isn’t alone in calling for stocks to fall amid a U.S. recession either. From billionaire investors to top investment banks, recession fears are spreading on Wall Street. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase and one of the most powerful voices in finance, argued there’s only a 33% chance the Federal Reserve can ensure a “soft landing” for the U.S. economy—in which rising inflation is tamed, but a recession is avoided—in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday. And Deutsche Bank said in April that it believes a “major” recession will come by 2023. Even former Fed officials have begun sounding the alarm, with former Fed Chair Randal Quarles saying in an interview last week that a recession is likely, “given the intensity of inflation.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•12 hours ago,"If history repeats itself, the bear market has 6 months of pain ahead, Bank of America’s chief strategist says",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-repeats-itself-bear-market-163227152.html

5/10/2022,"(Reuters) - Short-seller Hindenburg Research warned on Monday that Elon Musk's $44-billion offer to take Twitter Inc private could get repriced lower if the the world's richest person walked away from the deal. ""Musk holds all the cards here,"" Hindenburg, which has a short position on Twitter, said in a report. ""If Elon Musk's bid for Twitter disappeared tomorrow, Twitter's equity would fall by 50% from current levels. Consequently, we see a significant risk that the deal gets repriced lower."" Shares of the social media platform were down as much as 4% amid a broader market decline and touched $47.76, their lowest level since Musk made his $54.20 per share offer in April, calling it ""best and final"". Twitter declined to comment. ""Interesting. Don't forget to look on the bright side of life sometimes!"" Musk tweeted in a light-hearted response, to which the short-seller said it expects Tesla shareholders will thank him if the deal is done at a ""more reasonable price"". Hindenburg said the deal has seen a number of developments, from financing to board approval, which could have weakened Twitter's position. ""We are supportive of Musk's efforts to take Twitter private and see a significant chance the deal will close at a lower price,"" Hindenburg said. The short-seller said Tesla Inc chief executive could walk away paying the $1 billion breakup fee and has an incredible leverage to renegotiate if he chooses to. Last month, Twitter secured a $44-billion cash deal to sell itself to Musk, who received over $7 billion in funding from high-profile investors, including Oracle's co-founder Larry Ellison and Sequoia Capital. Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said there is a high probability that the deal would close at the stated offer price, except if Musk has a change of heart.
