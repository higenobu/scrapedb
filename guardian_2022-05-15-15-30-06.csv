5/15/2022,"Tim Spector’s kitchen fridge is swarming with life: kefir grains, sourdough mother, homemade kimchi and kombucha. Then there’s the vegetables: as varied and colourful as possible. While many diets eschew certain food groups, Spector’s focuses on incorporating as much variety as possible: at least 30 different plants a week – including nuts, seeds, pulses, whole grains, fruits and vegetables – on top of starchy staples such as potatoes or rice. The reason? He believes that diversity is crucial to warding off infections, combating age-related diseases and maintaining a healthy weight. Diversity cultivates a healthy microbiome – the micro-organisms living in our gut – which plays a vital role in digesting food, regulating our immune systems, and tweaking our brain chemistries through the chemicals they produce. “It’s that diversity of gut microbes that gives you a diversity of chemicals and, we believe, a healthier immune system and a better metabolism,” Spector says. “Once people start seeing that there is this link between the food we eat, our microbes and our immune systems, I think that changes the way we think about food. It’s not just fuel. It really is changing the way our body works.” Spector’s diet today is a far cry from what he used to eat: typically, muesli, orange juice and tea for breakfast – sometimes with toast and marmalade – and a tuna mayonnaise sandwich, packet of crisps and carton of orange juice for lunch. “My breakfast now is a mixture of kefir and full-fat yoghurt with some berries and mixed nuts and seeds on top, plus one or two big cups of black coffee. For lunch, I might have a curry, or some other heavily plant-based meal. I am virtually vegetarian, and eat far fewer starchy foods than I used to.” The event that prompted this change was suffering a mini stroke at the top of a mountain in his early 50s, after an energetic day of skiing in the Alps. “I went from being a sporty, fitter than average middle-aged man, to a pill-popping, depressed stroke victim with high blood pressure,” he recalls. It was a wake-up call that prompted him to reassess everything he thought he knew about healthy eating, including much of what he’d learned at medical school. A professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, Spector has spent much of his career researching how our life choices and events fuse with our genes. In 1993, he founded the UK Twins Registry at St Thomas’ Hospital in London, one of the richest collections of data about identical and non-identical twins in the world. For years, Spector believed that genetics would explain much of why people are the way they are. And to some extent it does. For instance, Spector’s group was among the first to demonstrate that people’s weight distribution is largely influenced by their genes. The trouble is, although identical twins have many similarities, they can often be quite different – despite sharing the same genes. “Trying to understand why one twin is sometimes overweight and the other skinny; one gets diabetes or cancer and the other doesn’t, has been a major theme for the past 20 years,” Spector says. The discovery, in 2014, that the composition of the microbes in people’s guts could influence their body weight, provided Spector’s first “Aha!” moment. But the blinkers really fell off when he and his colleagues measured twins’ and non-twins’ responses to identical meals, and discovered that they could vary hugely between individuals, influenced by both the microbiome and genetics. “Up to that point, we didn’t really have enough belief that you could personalise nutrition, or that you could link the uniqueness of the microbiome to the uniqueness in the food response – but suddenly, you had those two elements together,” says Spector. “We’re all very different in how we respond to the same meal, and a lot of this is explained by the huge differences in our microbiomes.” This doesn’t mean that other factors are irrelevant to people’s health: “How much you sleep at night, the quality of your food, the exercise you get, all these things are also important,” says Spector. “All we’re saying is that the microbiome is a major modifiable factor.” Spector likens the bacteria, fungi, and viruses in our guts to a kind of inner chemical plant: “Our own bodies only produce 20-odd gut hormones or chemicals, but these microbes produce thousands, which not only break down food into small amounts and use the contents, but produce lots of signalling compounds that are sending constant messages to our immune systems,” he says. They also produce brain chemicals, such as serotonin, as well as additional molecules that control how our bodies change food into energy. “We don’t know exactly how, but the state of your gut microbes will influence your blood sugar peaks, as well as how you digest fats and how quickly those fats are cleared by the body. Indirectly, both of those will lead to inflammation.” This is important, Spector explains, because chronic inflammation may increase the risk of various diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. It may also steer people towards laying down more body fat, which in turn then produces more inflammation. Our microbiome can also shape our responses to infection. Spector is probably best known for his work on the ZOE Covid symptom study, which has seen millions of users logging their daily symptoms via an app to help gain a better understanding of how Sars-CoV-2 spreads, and the nature of the illness it causes. One insight from the study is that people who consumed a greater diversity of plant-based foods pre-pandemic appear to be less susceptible to catching Covid-19, or becoming severely ill from it. While this doesn’t prove definitively that eating a diverse plant-based diet can ward off infections, Spector believes it could help: “Your immune system is compromised if you don’t have a good microbiome controlling it, and so it may either under- or overreact [to pathogens],” he says. “I don’t think eating for our microbiomes would stop pandemics, but I think it could make everyone less ill if they got infected.” So, how do we eat for our microbiomes? In Spector’s view, this comes back to consuming a diverse and predominantly plant-based diet, which is free from highly processed foods. “These are foods that you recognise, and could make yourself from your kitchen ingredients,” says Spector. “It’s plants that are rich in defence chemicals called polyphenols – generally ones with strong tastes and colours, slight bitterness, thick skins – basically the opposite of an iceberg lettuce. It’s those grapes we used to have as kids that were a bit sour and bitter. It’s the purple carrot rather than the white carrot” To up the polyphenol content even further, Spector recommends lashings of green tea, extra virgin olive oil, brightly coloured fruit and vegetables, herbs and spices – plus a dusting of dark chocolate. And don’t forget the four Ks: kefir, kombucha, kimchi and kraut (sauer) – as well as cheese and yoghurt – which act as fertiliser for ourresident gut bacteria. What this amounts to is very similar to a Mediterranean diet – one high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and containing less meat and dairy products than a typical western diet. Spector says: “It doesn’t really matter if you have bits of meat and fish on top of that – I don’t believe they’re necessarily healthy, but as long as you’re getting enough plants on your plate, it’s fine.” In his latest book, Spoon Fed, Spector also discusses how microbes can affect people’s mental health. Among scientists, there’s a growing consensus that depression may be linked to elevated levels of inflammation in at least a subset of patients; Spector argues that having the right gut microbes can counter this, because they secrete a range of chemicals that both keep inflammation in check, as well as altering our mood more directly. For instance, certain microbes help to produce serotonin – the same chemical that’s increased by some antidepressants. Studies have also suggested that people with depression have a less diverse set of microbes, on average, compared with healthy individuals. “A diverse Mediterranean-style diet with a range of fermented foods to keep your microbes happy is looking like the best present you can offer your brain,” Spector writes. Spector describes the changes he’s made to his diet as “an evolving process”. He only eats meat about once a month, while concerns about sustainability means he only has fish occasionally, at restaurants: “I wouldn’t say I suddenly had the answer when I discovered the microbiome, but I’ve slowly been changing the habits I had when I was a smug doctor thinking that I knew everything.”As well as a desire to nurture his “inner garden”, his dietary choices are motivated by the insights he’s gained from monitoring his personal responses to different foods. This is why he eschews large amounts of pasta, rice and potatoes – not because they are inherently unhealthy, but because using a continuous glucose monitor has revealed that they produce worryingly high spikes in his blood sugar levels. He is highly dismissive of one-size-fits-all diets, and the notion that weight loss is all about calories in v calories out: “It is complete nonsense,” he says. “You and I can eat two identical muffins with the same calories in them, and you might have a mild sugar spike and no sugar dip, whereas I will have a big sugar spike and a sugar dip, and I will overeat by 200 calories in that day, and you won’t. That simple experiment, which we’ve now done on thousands of people, just blows out of the water the idea that it’s all about calories.” In April, ZOE, the personalised nutrition company that Spector co-founded, began inviting about 180,000 individuals on its waiting list to buy an early access version of its “ZOE programme”, an attempt to bring personalised nutrition to the UK masses. It’s still a luxury lifestyle option at the moment – the £260 price tag puts it out of reach of the mass market – but early access members will start with an at-home test, the results of which provides them with personalised scores for thousands of foods in the ZOE app. Members also access daily lessons, recipes, live chat with ZOE coaches, and more. The programme consists of two parts: testing and ongoing membership. A testing kit consisting of three packets of standardised muffins (to test your biological responses and challenge your metabolism with high doses of fat and sugar), a continuous glucose monitor, plus stool and blood sampling kits; the idea is to test how people respond to various foods over a two-week period, and provide them with personalised scores for thousands of foods, and nutrition coaching, based on these results. Spector’s ultimate goal is to change the way people think about food. “You’re eating hundreds of chemicals when you eat a carrot, it’s not just the orange colour – there’s all this other stuff that’s hidden,” he says. “All those things are lost when you stick food into a factory, ultra-process it, and put it into a vacuum pack.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Go with your gut: scientist Tim Spector on why food is not just fuel,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/15/go-with-your-gut-tim-spector-power-of-microbiome
5/15/2022,"Oh the irony! Boris Johnson, the Brexit ringleader who turned his back on the EU, now boldly leads the defence of Europe in the face of Russian aggression. An exaggeration? Yes, but behind the hype lies an intriguing story. Even as he risks another major rift with Brussels over Northern Ireland, Johnson is using the Ukraine crisis to mend fences with some old European allies. His aim: to re-establish the UK as a continental power. The signing last week of bilateral defence pacts with Nato aspirants Sweden and Finland – “our friends in the north” – was the latest manifestation of an apparently concerted British drive to revive political ties with eastern and central European and Nordic countries that were natural UK allies before the Brexit rupture. Johnson and senior ministers have repeatedly visited Poland and the Baltic republics as the Ukraine crisis has unfolded. Britain’s rapid deployment of extra troops and equipment along Nato’s “front line” with Russia, and this month’s pledge of an additional $1.6bn in sophisticated weaponry and aid to Ukraine itself, has been praised by regional governments and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who hosted Johnson last month. In sharp contrast, the EU’s “top two”, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz, have yet to visit wartime Kyiv. Central to British pushback in Europe is the Joint Expeditionary Force, a Nato-aligned, non-EU military grouping embracing the UK, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands. The JEF is deeply involved in Ukraine-related defence. Seen one way, it’s the “European army” the EU often talks about but never manages to organise – and it’s led by Britain. Johnson is undoubtedly sincere in prioritising Russia’s defeat. For him, the war symbolises the global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism. In this, he sticks close to the US, Nato’s leader and post-Brexit Britain’s essential ally, without whose agreement he dares do little. Yet competing with France and Germany for power and influence in Europe, and challenging the grand panjandrums of Brussels, at a time of profound geopolitical upheaval is for him a very different matter – and a potentially politically rewarding pursuit. Before Ukraine erupted, Johnson was already courting rightwing governments in Warsaw and Budapest which, like Britain, are fighting running battles with the EU. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s hard-right leader, who is blocking oil sanctions on Russia, was warmly welcomed in Downing Street last year. Britain’s wooing of Europe’s eastern and northern flanks dates from the period between 1995 and 2004, when numerous EU applicants were backed by London to offset and weaken the dominant France-Germany-Benelux axis. Since then, Paris has mostly opposed further EU enlargement. Macron warned Ukraine last week that it could wait decades for full membership. Johnson’s more positive Ukraine activism is favourably compared, in London, Washington and parts of eastern Europe, with perceived hesitancy, division and weakness at the heart of the EU. Germany’s Scholz, clinging to the wreckage of Ostpolitik, has become synonymous with foot-dragging. Despite belatedly agreeing to supply heavy weapons and ban oil imports, he has left Germans distinctly underwhelmed, if his party’s Schleswig-Holstein state election flop is any guide. Fresh from winning a second presidential term, and observing Berlin’s travails, Macron now seems to think he’s boss of Europe. But on the continent’s most urgent issue, the reality is different. The value of French military assistance to Kyiv ($105m) is less than half of tiny Estonia’s ($220m). Macron’s vainglorious pre-war “phone diplomacy” with Putin badly backfired – in truth, he was played. And France’s EU presidency is still struggling to agree energy sanctions. More broadly, Macron’s cherished plans to create a “strategically autonomous” Europe, independent of the US (and China), have shattered into pieces amid the Ukraine maelstrom. In 2019, he declared Nato “brain dead”, a reckless claim that, with hindsight, may have helped convince Putin it really was. Now, in a few frantic months, a rejuvenated Nato, buoyed by multibillion-dollar US arms packages and with Britain to the fore, has saved Europe’s as well as Kyiv’s figurative bacon. Naturally, the EU does not agree. Brussels reckons it’s doing a fine job and on refugees, for example, it is – unlike Priti Patel’s Home Office. In truth, everyone could and should be doing more. Yet the uncomfortably brutal bottom line is this: were it not for the swift, courageous and generous commitments made by the US and UK, plus anglosphere countries such as Canada and Australia, Ukraine might well have lost the war by now, free democratic Europe would be in headlong retreat, and Putin could be eyeing his next victim while keeping Macron on hold. Huge, uncertain shifts in relative power balances across Europe are now in train as a consequence of the war. The EU, under strong internal pressure to reform from its own “Conference on the Future of Europe”, which reported last week, faces big questions about relevance, cohesion and decision-making. French and German leaders badly need to forge a shared vision. The US has re-engaged in Europe – but for how long? As for the UK, recent events have surely reminded the most recalcitrant Brexiters that Europe is Britain’s home turf, the inescapable neighbourhood where primary national interests lie. Less is heard, thankfully, about “global Britain’s” Asia-Pacific tilt or US free trade nirvana. Ukraine gave isolated Johnson an opportunity and, true to form, he seized it. But never underestimate his ability, and that of his attention-seeking foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to throw it all away. Suspending aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol and abrogating the Brexit treaty, as they threaten to do this week, is one sure way to unite Europe against Britain – again – and wreck the anti-Putin alliance.",Opinion/Opinion,Boris Johnson uses Ukraine crisis to launch a British comeback in Europe | Simon Tisdall,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/boris-johnson-ukraine-crisis-british-comeback-europe
5/15/2022,"The Liberal Democrats will put all their campaign efforts into only one of two crucial byelections this summer – leaving Labour to fight the Tories in the other – as pressure intensifies on leftwing parties to work more closely together to oust the Conservatives from power. The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, told the Observer on Saturday that his party would concentrate on the Devon seat of Tiverton and Honiton because it believes it can pull off a sensational win against the incumbent Conservatives in the south-west, where it has traditionally been strong. But with resources and money limited, the Lib Dems know they can maximise their chances there only if they limit help for their candidate in the other contest, in Wakefield, where Labour is the traditional incumbent but was pushed into second by the Tories at the 2019 general election. The two byelections – caused by the resignations of Tory MPs Neil Parish and Imran Ahmad Khan over sex-related sleaze scandals – are likely to be held on the same day on a byelection “super Thursday” in late June or early July. The double election is seen as a potentially critical moment for Boris Johnson’s administration. If the prime minister were to lose both it would be another blow to his chances of surviving in office, showcasing his vulnerability to twin Lib Dem and Labour recoveries in their respective heartlands, following the Partygate scandal and with a cost of living crisis raging. Without mentioning the Wakefield contest, Davey said: “Political parties always put resources where they can win, so we will be working incredibly hard to take the fight to the Tories in Tiverton and Honiton.” With Labour certain to do the reverse, prioritising Wakefield while backing off in Tiverton and Honiton, there is now a growing focus on how far the parties on the centre-left should go in terms of cooperating – whether it be informal “one-off” arrangements, or more organised pacts, in order to dislodge the Tories. A special constituency-level MRP survey of 10,000 voters, commissioned and published on Sunday by the pressure group Best for Britain, has found that if Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens came to formal agreements not to fight each other in 119 English seats at the next general election, they would be able to form a coalition government without relying on MPs from the Scottish National party. However, if such pacts only happened between parties on the right and no such arrangements were made on the left, then Labour would fall short of that majority and could govern only by relying on the SNP. Ukip stood down in seats where it risked splitting the rightwing vote when Theresa May was prime minister in 2017, and the Brexit party stood down for Johnson in 2019. If past behaviour is any indication, Reform UK, the successor to the Brexit party, is likely to stand down to help the Conservatives if a Labour-led government looks likely at the next election. The Best for Britain polling found that if the 2017 and 2019 situation were to be repeated with no similar arrangement on the left, then Labour would win 307 seats, the Tories 261, SNP 52, the Lib Dems 7, Plaid Cymru 4 and the Greens 1. This would not be enough for Labour to govern without the SNP. However, if Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens were to play the rightwing parties at their own game, and agree to stand down candidates in order to maximise their chances of winning against the Tories, then Labour would win 323, the Tories 239, SNP 52, the Lib Dems 13, Plaid Cymru 4 and the Greens 1. Under this scenario Labour would be able to govern with the Lib Dems but without the SNP. Naomi Smith, the CEO of Best for Britain, said: “To win, Labour needs to do what the Conservatives most fear them doing, and that’s working with the Lib Dems and the Greens at election time. “The parties on the right stand down for each other to secure majority governments on a minority of the votes, and our data shows that the safest way for opposition parties to defeat this corrupt and failing government is to stand aside for one another in the seats they can’t win. “We saw last week in the local elections that voters up and down the country are already collaborating to get rid of this government. Their party leaders need to catch up.” Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, added: “In an election where the opposition vote is split, many voters will want to back the candidate who is most likely to win and deliver change. To this end we must be honest with each other about the situation in each constituency and ensure that the voters have the information they need to lock the Tories out of power.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: “This polling shows that in many constituencies, the Green party holds the key to beating the Conservatives, a point underlined by our strong performance in the recent local elections.”",News/Politics,Pressure grows on Labour and Lib Dems to agree joint anti-Tory strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/pressure-grows-on-labour-and-lib-dems-to-agree-joint-anti-tory-strategy
5/15/2022,"In 2011, Mo Gilligan posted on Twitter that he quite fancied hosting the Brit Awards. Or the Mobos: he wasn’t that picky. At the time, he was a very green, 23-year-old comedian, who lived with his mum in south London and worked as a sales assistant in shops – it might have been Jo Malone in Westfield or Levi’s Covent Garden back then. Gilligan set a target for 2013 and signed off: “fingers crossed”. This February, admittedly a few years later than projected, Gilligan stood on stage in front of 20,000 people at what he called “the MO2”. Wearing a deep-green Ozwald Boateng three-piece suit, he had taken over from Jack Whitehall as the steward of the first gender-neutral Brits. His impression of Liam Gallagher had gone down well, and he’d mostly got away with accidently saying “fuck” on primetime live TV: “Auntie Patrice won’t be happy,” he apologised. “No curried goat for me.” Now, in an ad break, Gilligan had a few seconds to take in the scene. “I looked around the room and you’ve got Adele there, Idris Elba’s over there,” he recalls. “I’m seeing all these names and it was so humbling. It was the one time I felt like I was in the moment. I’m in the middle of it, and I’ve got the producers in my ear going, ‘OK, Mo, we’re gonna go live in 30 seconds…’ and everyone’s just screaming. And I was looking around and I was just, like: ‘Whoa, I have come very far in my career.’” Gilligan does seem to be everywhere right now, in a good way. The 34-year-old is a judge on The Masked Singer and The Masked Dancer, alongside Jonathan Ross and Davina McCall. He’s on Celebrity Gogglebox, slurping Calippos and singing along to the Spice Girls. His Channel 4 chat show, The Lateish Show with Mo Gilligan, won a TV Bafta in 2020. He was so pleased that he named his dog, a cockapoo, Baffy. Gilligan picked up another one the following year for The Big Narstie Show, which he has co-hosted with the British grime MC since 2018. (The Lateish Show was up for best Comedy Entertainment Programme again at the 2022 Baftas last weekend, after we went to press, so Gilligan might already have a third golden statuette by now.) TV isn’t even Gilligan’s comfort zone: he calls himself “still a student” of the medium. He’s most at ease doing standup. During his tour last autumn, he played 28 dates in 15 UK cities before finishing at the Hammersmith Apollo, where he sold out 10 – 10! – nights. The show has now become his second Netflix special, There’s Mo to Life, a masterclass in slick, smart observational comedy. Gilligan topped off the tour with a showcase at the O2 called Mo Gilligan + Friends: the Black British Takeover, where he performed alongside less-established Black comedians, including his Gogglebox sofa-mate Babatúndé Aléshé. Gilligan still appears to be a bit stunned by his recent success when we meet at a photo studio in north London: like a man who placed an accumulator bet five years ago and has watched them come in, one after another. His hair is buzzed short, his beard’s a bit wispy and he’s in good shape, mainly from half-hour, daily runs on a treadmill in preparation for the Soccer Aid charity football match at the London Stadium in June. It has been announced that his manager will be Arsène Wenger, and Gilligan, an Arsenal fan, doesn’t want to let him down. “I never thought I’d sell out the Hammersmith Apollo,” says Gilligan, shaking his head. “Then you do one night and it sells out. And that’s exciting. Then you do three and four, and it turns to 10. And you’re like, ‘Whoa, man, I’m happy with that.’ Then you do the O2. In the moment it is quite hard to understand it, but especially once you’ve completed something you’re like, ‘Wow, bloody hell man, this is just going all right. Yeah, I think I’ll keep at this, man!’” The Brits tweet from 2011 wasn’t meant to be taken too seriously – Gilligan was not a man given to 10-year career projections, certainly at that time. “I’d be lying if I was sitting there as a 23-year-old and I was like, ‘That’s the goal, write it down and put it out to the universe,’” he says. “I didn’t, I was just tweeting.” Is Gilligan relieved – after what happened with Will Smith at the Oscars – that he didn’t get a slap from Liam Gallagher for his impression? “Haha, I wouldn’t call myself a provocative comedian,” he replies. “In the Black comedy circuit, it’s not a thing to take the mick out of your audience. Because they’ve dressed up. They’ve had their hair done, babysitter, you know, my man’s got a trim, he’s got the car cleaned. And the minute I go out there and I’m like, ‘What’s going on there, my guy? Is that your missus, yeah?’ He’s already looking at me like” – under his breath – “‘Big man, don’t do it! Don’t do it.’ I learned that very early on.” Gilligan says that he was “as shocked as everyone else” by what happened to Chris Rock. “I felt like I got slapped!” he exclaims. “I felt like the world was like, ‘Yeah, we got slapped as well!’ I’m still waiting, there’s going to be a documentary where the whole thing was a big setup. Something’s going to happen in the next year, and I really want to be the person to be like, ‘You see! I knew it! I told you it wasn’t real.’” When he was growing up, Gilligan says, “TV didn’t feel realistic” as a future career. Home was an estate in Camberwell, south London, where he lived with his mother and two sisters. His parents separated when he was five, and his father, a Rastafarian, lived in Brixton, where he grew his own vegetables and did some landscaping. Gilligan, who is dyslexic, went to Pimlico School, a few years after the rapper and actor Ashley Walters, who was from a nearby estate in Peckham. They had the same drama teacher, Miss Simpson. When Walters made his film debut in Bullet Boy in 2004, she organised a class trip to see it. “I wanted to be a footballer… everyone wanted to be a footballer,” says Gilligan. “But when I was 14, Miss Simpson said, ‘You’re really good at performing arts, you should try and pursue that.’ It was the one thing that someone told me that I was good at.” This background in acting makes sense when you see Gilligan’s standup. He’s a brilliant mimic, perfectly picking up the verbal tics and mannerisms of, say, a shifty man telling his girlfriend that he has arranged to go out with his mates on Saturday night (he’s also pretty spot-on as the aggrieved girlfriend). Gilligan’s jokes are almost impossible to repeat: when you try, you realise how much of the skill and craft comes from his pauses, posture and sly eyebrow raises. “I wouldn’t say I’m a comedian who’s incredibly witty,” says Gilligan. “Every comic has their thing, and when I first started doing comedy, I would try everything: ‘I’m gonna try do some political jokes… yeah, this ain’t really running.’ Or, ‘Let me sit down on a stool and tell some jokes.’ And I was like, ‘Nah, man, I can’t sit on the stool.’ I think at that age, when I was doing standup, I hadn’t earned the right to be the comic that can sit on the stool and be cool like Dave Chappelle, maybe have a cigarette and… [he takes an imaginary puff]. “I am massively influenced by acting and movement, which we did a lot at school,” he continues. “But I think my observations and my storytelling are what grabs people’s attention, that’s probably where I’m able to excel, really.” Talking about this period, and his fails, is also Gilligan’s way of saying that he’s no overnight success. He worked hard for years before anyone really took notice. Most of this was on the Black comedy circuit, but in the summer of 2015, Gilligan decided to try his luck at the Edinburgh Fringe. He went up with his friend, the British-Kurdish standup Kae Kurd, and they would flyer in the morning and perform a free show – bucket at the end – in the Caves at midday. “The format before was that you’d go to Edinburgh and, if your show did very well, you might go on a panel show and that’s how you can sell your tour,” says Gilligan. “But I realised my audience wasn’t there. The audience that I was going to get wasn’t going to come from Edinburgh, it wasn’t going to be the people who are like, ‘Yeah, we go Edinburgh…’ and they tell their friends at a dinner party to come and see Mo Gilligan.” His audience, it turned out, was on social media. While working at Levi’s, Gilligan started making minute-long videos that he edited during breaks. A series on the “different type of MCs” went viral in 2016 and 2017, with a nudge from the Canadian rapper Drake. “I didn’t have a big following at that time and it was just one video that done well,” he recalls. “MCs, musicians, celebrities started sharing it, and I think that was the thing that propelled me.” TV work followed, first bickering with Big Narstie. “We’re almost like two brothers, a little bit,” says Gilligan. “And the nice thing about Narstie is that he can equally take a joke. We get at each other – cussing each other’s mums is probably the one thing that’s off-limits – but we make sure if we’re gonna get at each other that the jokes are funny.” There are moments that are career-changing and others that are life-changing: Gilligan knew instantly that when Channel 4 offered him his own chat show, The Lateish Show with Mo Gilligan, it was the latter. It’s part of the reason that he is so furious – “a fuckrey” – about the government’s plans to privatise the broadcaster. “Channel 4 trusted me,” he says. “They were like, ‘You’re very good at what you do, we want to give you a show.’ And they didn’t need to do that. Yes, I had an audience that was thriving and stuff, but to say, ‘Hey, we’re gonna back you, give it a shot…’ that was like, ‘Wow!’ I knew the minute they said it, my life would change. And what I worry about is, with it being private, is the next young Mo Gilligan going to get that same opportunity?” Gilligan was right that his life would change. He moved out of his mum’s, first to a penthouse – well, top-floor – flat in east London, and he’s recently bought a five-bedroom house in the leafy northern suburbs, which he shares with Baffy and his girlfriend, actor Sophie Wise. He’s still close with his old crew from south London – “They keep you grounded, they’ll still take the piss out of you” – but also now Stormzy, Dave, Raheem Sterling and Ashley Walters. Zone-five life seems to suit him. “I have turned into such an old man before my time,” says Gilligan. “I went to B&Q the other day and bought a lawnmower, a petrol lawnmower. And I promise you that was one of the funnest days in my life of just cutting my own grass. I’ve got a jet washer, man. Oh, man! Do you know how fun a jet washer is? Hahaha, I bought one for my mum as well. I was like, ‘Mum, I’m gonna get you a jet washer.’ Mum was like, ‘I ain’t got nothing to jet wash.’ I’m like, ‘We’ll find some stuff… We’ll find some stuff.’ That’s my life now.” Gilligan is fully animated, recommending those little LED-studded gloves, which allow you to work when the sun goes down (“The job doesn’t stop because it’s dark!”). He’s also fallen hard for Lego Architecture sets, and is proud of the Big Ben he’s just completed. “Ah man, these are the things that I really enjoy in life,” he says. “It is so mad because I’ve got so many other friends who are like, ‘Yeah, we going to this festival, we’re going to that.’ And I’m like, ‘I hear that, but I’m trying to get some flowerbeds ready. Next year my tulips need to be banging!’” Work isn’t slowing down, either. A new series of The Lateish Show with Mo Gilligan starts at the end of the month, which is the most ambitious yet, with eight episodes instead of five, and a guest list jacked up by Hollywood stars travelling again. Gilligan also has eye on America himself: he recently had his first headline show in LA at the Netflix is a Joke festival. He’s not ruling out returning to acting one day, too. “I have been offered lovely roles, which I’m so flattered by,” he says. “But I’ve always been like, ‘That’s just not right for me.’ But yeah, hopefully one day, man. Don’t get me wrong, if Top Boy came calling, I’d be there in a heartbeat, bruv.” But before all that, at least this morning, Gilligan is mostly preoccupied with getting home and digging out a couple of invasive bamboo bushes in his back garden. “Oooh, it grows lightning fast,” he sighs. “And you can’t just cut it down, you’ve got to take it out from the root. These are the fun tasks that me being a comic that has two Netflix specials and does TV and has all these fun celebrity mates has… Who knew that Alan Titchmarsh has a rival!” The new series of The Lateish Show with Mo Gilligan starts on Channel 4 on 27 May",Global,‘I never thought I’d sell out the Apollo’: Mo Gilligan on why he’d rather be gardening than partying,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/may/15/mo-gilligan-standup-interview-i-never-thought-id-sell-out-the-apollo-gardening
5/15/2022,"Last week’s intermission in the Johnny Depp–Amber Heard defamation case, which will resume on Monday, temporarily stopped a deluge of disturbing testimony and slowed the PR war between the two once-married actors, but the parallel court of public opinion has barely paused its deliberations on a case being eagerly followed around the world. Part two of the Depp v Heard case in Fairfax, Virginia, will see Heard conclude her testimony, and then come under cross-examination by Depp’s legal team, before her attorneys call witnesses including Hollywood star Ellen Barkin, who had a relationship with Depp in the 90s, and Heard’s sister, Whitney Henriquez. But four weeks in, the terms of the case have already have been set. And it’s not one case but two. In one, Depp is claiming defamation for a 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which Heard described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse; in the other, and perhaps more valuable to the actor, is his effort to reclaim a reputation and career that were badly damaged when Heard took out a temporary restraining order against him in 2016. She is countersuing over his claim that her allegations are a hoax. “He was willing to have all the ugly, dark sides of him come out. The details didn’t make him look good, and the public was not necessarily aware of them, in order to clear his name about the abuse,” said Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer Mitra Ahouraian. “That to me is powerful, because he’s trying to win the court of public opinion.” But Heard has also made her defense more complicated than it perhaps needed to be. “She had to establish that she was a victim of domestic violence but through her testimony she has taken on a far greater burden by describing ongoing multiple episodes – not just domestic violence but sexual violence, vaginal searches, rape with a bottle,” said Dr Jill Huntley Taylor at Taylor Trial Consulting. The standard for defamation for public figures in the US is set high – Depp must prove what was said was untrue and that Heard knew that it was untrue, or said with malice. But he could also win in the court of public opinion – in essence on social media, and with moviegoers – by losing. “His claim may not be viable in the legal system, but he’s definitely winning in the court of public opinion,” said Ahouraian. “People are sharing clips they find endearing and not paying as much attention to things that may not make him look good, or dismissing them as a normal reaction to someone who is being an aggressor.” But Heard has not finished her testimony, nor been placed under cross-examination. “This case is far from over, and many pundits have spent this off-week drawing conclusions about Ms Heard’s testimony and discussing how Depp will likely lose in court,” noted Los Angeles lawyer Allison Hope Weiner. “Even if he doesn’t prevail in court, the real issue is whether the public is willing to go see his movies and the studios will reverse his cancellation.” A study of TikTok memes and views indicates a clear bias to Depp, despite the ex-spouses both claiming to be victims of intimate partner violence, and Heard aligning her experience with the #MeToo movement. “What’s coming out on social media, on Instagram and TikTok, is pretty abhorrent because these are serious allegations of abuse coming from both sides,” said Alex McCready, head of reputation and privacy at Vardags law. At the same time, McCready acknowledges, “the PR strategy around a case can be as important.”. The TikTok tag #JusticeforJohnnyDepp has more than 10bn views – more than the tags #AmberHeard (8.4bn) and #JusticeforAmberHeard (37.2m). During Heard’s 4 May testimony, 587,285 people were watching the Law & Crime livestream. But the case is complex for other reasons: Depp’s lawsuit was allowed to proceed on the doctrine of defamation only by implication – Depp was not named in the Heard ACLU-drafted article, nor did it restate any of the abuse allegations. Instead, Heard wrote that she “felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out”. The doctrine holds that seemingly neutral and accurate statements can still make a defamatory insinuation. The jury of 11 – with seven who will be called on to deliberate, and four alternates – will be faced with teasing that out after 27 May, when closing arguments are presented. But they may face other challenges too. During jury selection, Deadline reported, one potential juror said that he’d texted his wife that he might be called. “Amber is psychotic. If a man says a woman beat him, they never believe him,” came a reply. Asked by Heard’s attorneys if he could still be impartial, the man said that he could. “She tends to exaggerate.” Asked if his wife would be angry if he sided with Depp, he said: “She gets mad at me all the time.” It sounds bizarre. But then the whole case has often felt an exercise in extreme.",Arts/Film,"As Depp v Heard resumes, so does the trial by social media ",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/15/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-social-media
5/15/2022,"The chaos caused by Brexit is here for all but the most pigheaded Brexiters to see. Why, no less a figure than the minister for Brexit “opportunities”, one Jacob Rees-Mogg, finds himself having to delay further implementation of customs bureaucracy because of the damage even he can see in front of him. Bringing in full checks the government had agreed in order “to get Brexit done” would, said Rees-Mogg, have been “an act of self-harm”, adding an extra £1bn to the already enormous cost of Brexit. No, I am not making this up. There was another priceless example of what a nonsensical government we have when Conor Burns, the minister of state for Northern Ireland, appeared on Channel 4 News last Wednesday. Holding a vast pile of documentation given to him in despair by a road haulier, he complained that this was the kind of form-filling lorry drivers had to cope with to qualify for entry from Brexit Britain to Northern Ireland. The minister seemed blissfully unaware that the bundle of bumf he was displaying was the consequence of his own government’s Brexit policies. Like the Democratic Unionist party, he was complaining about the Northern Ireland protocol, the arrangement negotiated by Boris Johnson under which border controls were introduced between England and Northern Ireland, because the latter remains, with the republic of Ireland, in the single market, and Great Britain, owing to Brexit, does not. Johnson’s attempts to go back, in the case of Northern Ireland, on yet another of his words may be in the domestic and international news; but businesses all over the country are also struggling with the excessive form-filling and extra costs of the Brexit trade war that this government has inflicted on itself. To take just one example: reader Edward Fishlock, a wine merchant in Wadebridge, Cornwall, has emailed me with a horrifying account of the time-wasting and extra costs involved in conducting his business; he receives precious little support from his local (Conservative) MP. This kind of Brexit self-harm is being experienced all over the country. Of course the government blames the severe recrudescence of inflation, and the deleterious impact on people’s spending power of world events outside its control. However, as economist Adam Posen of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics points out, the UK is particularly vulnerable to “external shocks”. Brexit has been accompanied by “an erosion of trust in UK governments to run disciplined economic policies”. The pound has once again become a vulnerable currency in international markets. Since that referendum result it has been devalued by some 12% against the average of other major currencies. International Monetary Fund calculations indicate that inflation is rising faster here than in our former EU partners – a forecast 7.4% this year in the UK, compared with 5.3% in the euro area. As Posen says, the difference is “largely due to Britain’s departure from the EU”. I have covered many a sterling crisis over the years. It is important to distinguish between necessary adjustments when a currency becomes uncompetitive and losses of confidence that start a downward spiral, and thereby an upward spiral in inflation. Of course there is an obvious solution to both the Northern Irish and sterling crises: a nation that still styles itself Great Britain could rejoin the single market. In which context it is worth remembering that Daniel, now Lord, Hannan – one of the most influential people behind Brexit – said in 2015 that “absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market”. Again, the founder of the Referendum party, James Goldsmith, was, according to his biographer, a firm believer in remaining in the single market. It’s a funny old world. The Financial Times journalist Simon Kuper gives a superb account of the malign forces that culminated in Brexit in his book Chums: How a Tiny Caste of Oxford Tories Took Over the UK. But it is not just the economic self-harm that rankles. Kuper draws an intriguing comparison between the prewar and wartime Cambridge spies who were acting for the Soviet Union and the Oxford Brexiters. Putin most certainly wanted Brexit and the breakup of the European Union. Fortunately, the Ukraine crisis seems to be having a beneficent effect on the EU – certainly not what he wanted. While he admits his comparison between the Cambridge and Oxford sets isn’t entirely fair, Kuper states: “Though both betrayed Britain’s interests in the service of Moscow, the Brexiters did it by mistake.” One can only hope, to quote the chorus in The Clouds, by Aristophanes: “Mark here how rarely it succeeds/To build our trust on guilty deeds.”",News/Business,Cambridge spies and Brexiters have a lot in common,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/cambridge-spies-and-brexiters-have-a-lot-in-common
5/15/2022,"Having come to London from Finland in the 1960s to study photography, Finnish-born Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen moved to the Byker district of Newcastle in 1968, with a plan to document the lives of the people who lived around her. She took this picture of a girl in her dressing-up box frock on her space hopper in 1971. “She bounced past my camera that day to disappear down the cobbled lane with her dreams,” Konttinen told the Tate gallery more than 40 years later, suggesting that the girl’s “maverick splendour personified the vibrant working-class community where I lived”. Those cobbled streets of Byker were mostly being demolished by then, to make way for the futuristic high-rise Byker Wall housing estate, designed by Ralph Erskine, which became the inspiration for the TV soap Byker Grove. Konttinen made two books of photographs of the area, Byker and Byker Revisited, a “before” and “after” of that redevelopment that gave a profound visual language to an experience that was happening across cities in the UK. Another Newcastle project of hers, on dance classes, was one inspiration for the film Billy Elliot. This picture of the girl on the space hopper is included in Another Country, a new book of British documentary photography since the war. For 40 years, Konttinen wondered about the identity of the girl in the picture. In 2011, a woman called Jackie Tait contacted her, having seen the photograph, to say the little girl was her. She told Konttinen that she sat transfixed looking at the picture on her screen for two hours, with childhood memories overwhelming her. The family had moved from Byker soon afterwards. “I want you to know I am happy,” Tait told the photographer. “My life has turned out well.” The pair eventually met five years later, 45 years after the six-year-old girl had bounced down the street, from one idea of England to another.

5/15/2022,"David Rosner continually talks to colleagues who are distraught about the American response to the Covid-19 pandemic. “When you are in a school of public health and a public health environment, people really feel when they are failing,” said Rosner, who studies public health and social history at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. That defeated feeling is compounded by the fact that 1 million people in the US have died from Covid-19 – the highest Covid death rate among large wealthy countries. According to public health experts, the virus’s outsized impact on the US can be attributed in part to underinvestment in long-term care, in primary care and in public health departments. As a result, some people were more vulnerable to Covid and had little connection to – or trust in – the healthcare providers who urged them to socially distance, to wear masks and to get vaccinated. It was a disconnect, they say, that was only exacerbated by misinformation – particularly by Republican leaders’ undermining of scientists’ recommendations. “This is more than just a failure of a health system,” said Rosner. “It’s a failure of an American ideology.” The problems in US society and healthcare that lead to the high death toll predate the pandemic. In 2018, the country spent an average of $10,637 on healthcare per person, almost twice as much as other large and wealthy countries, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. And yet, compared with those countries, the US had a significantly lower life expectancy and the worst healthcare quality and access. Almost $4,000 of that additional spending comes from higher payments to hospitals for inpatient and outpatient hospital care. Meanwhile, over the last decade, US spending for state public and local health departments decreased by 16% and 18% respectively. “We have really valued the hospital care to the exclusion of public health and community healthcare in this country,” said Sheila Davis, CEO of the non-profit Partners in Health, which tries to bring healthcare to the world’s poorest places. She argues that reimbursement patterns in the US focus on care delivered at hospitals, “which is the most expensive place to deliver care, with the most expensive providers”, she said. As an alternative, she points to a comprehensive model, “which has excellent hospital care but also has a strong public health department, as well as community care”, such as federally qualified health centers in underserved communities. The one health area where the US spends significantly less than other countries is on long-term care, including nursing homes. In 2018, the country spent $516 a person on long-term care, less than half of what comparable countries spent, according to KFF data. The pandemic exposed these disparities. About three-quarters of Americans who died from Covid were 65 or older – including more than 150,000 nursing home residents, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. A majority – more than two-thirds – of nursing homes in the US are for-profit institutions. They often don’t pay their workers much, are understaffed and have high turnover rates: the mean US wage for nursing assistants and orderlies in 2020 was $14.82 an hour, and the mean turnover rate for nurse staff in 2017 and 2018 was 128%, according to a study. That understaffing saw some nursing homes fail to follow best practice for infection control, said Dr Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist at New York University and editor-at-large for Kaiser Health News. “If you have workers who are paid poorly and have very difficult working conditions, they are not going to trust the employer as much,” Gounder said. “So in a crisis when you have lack of trust, that’s going to create barriers to everyone working in synchronicity to address problems.” Almost half of the aides and personal care workers, who often make little money, are Black or Hispanic. Nursing homes whose staff come from “less white” neighborhoods saw larger Covid-19 outbreaks, probably because those neighborhoods are also generally denser and have residents who rely more on public transportation, according to a report from a Harvard University economist. Nursing home residents “were the most vulnerable population – so if Covid made it into the building, bad outcomes were likely to follow shortly thereafter”, said Brian McGarry, a University of Rochester professor who studies long-term care. In general, life just appeared to be more difficult for seniors in the US than those in similar countries – even before the pandemic. For example, US seniors tend to be more likely to worry about having enough money for meals or medical needs, and to not fill a prescription or skip doses because of the cost, according to a 2017 Health Affairs study. In the US, 36% of older adults reported having three or more chronic conditions, such as chronic lung diseases and heart conditions, which placed people at greater risk of becoming severely ill from Covid. In New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland, the figures were 17% or under. The US also had the highest rate – 55% – of people taking four or more prescriptions regularly. Gounder’s grandparents lived in Normandy, France, and never had to worry about medical bills or whether they could see a doctor, she said. “There might be a wait to get an appointment, but they could always get the medical care they needed,” she said. Americans are also less likely to have a primary care provider, which contributed to the high death toll here. In the Netherlands, 71% of adults have had a regular doctor or place of care for five years or more; in the US, the number is 43%, according to a study from the Commonwealth Fund, a non-profit focused on improving the health system. “It’s especially a factor when it comes to the vaccination campaign,” said Dr David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund. “We know from survey data that people like to get vaccinated in their primary care physician’s office, but too few Americans have primary care physicians.” That shortage is due in part, Blumenthal said, to tuition fees and to the wage gap between primary care doctor and specialists – again, both figures where the US tops the charts. “Compensation is an important factor: it’s not just how much people are paid but how hard they have to work to get that level of income,” said Blumenthal, who was a primary care physician himself. Without a primary care provider, he said, many sick people end up visiting emergency rooms – or not seeking care at all. “In the pandemic, when you are going to an emergency room, you are surrounding yourself with tens or hundreds of other people, many of whom will not have been infected until you show up, so it’s not an epidemiologically helpful way to manage sick people,” Blumenthal said. Meanwhile, the US counties that were hit hardest after vaccines became available were those in which a majority voted for Donald Trump in 2020, according to a National Public Radio study. Since vaccines became widely available in May 2021, people in counties where more than 60% of voters supported Trump were 2.73 times as likely to die from Covid than those in counties where that same percentage supported Joe Biden. The US also trailed other large wealthy countries in its vaccination rate – and a contributor to that was the low vaccination rates among Republicans. As of November 2021, 91% of Democrats had received at least one dose of the vaccine, while only 53% of Republicans had, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. “You can’t separate our failure in the pandemic from conflicts over ideology and politics,” said Blumenthal. “The approach to the pandemic became enmeshed in people’s party affiliation and in their views towards government.” That’s in large part due to Republicans such as Trump, said Rosner. After the then-president contracted Covid in October 2020 and became much sicker than he publicly acknowledged, Trump wrote on Twitter: “Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.” During a presidential debate, Trump also said of Biden: “I don’t wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask.” Contrast that with another conservative politician, Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, Rosner said. After also being hospitalized with Covid, Johnson thanked his nurses and said the National Health Service had saved his life “no question” and that “things could have gone either way”. “It’s not like [Johnson] is some angel, but he acknowledged something deeper in British culture that in some sense trusted medicine, trusted public health, trusted the health system, in a way that Trump didn’t even feel was necessary,” said Rosner. Despite their dismay over the number of preventable Covid deaths, public health experts say they are encouraged by federal government efforts to make sure the US is better prepared for the next emergency, which they say is inevitable. For example, the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (Cares) Act included $300m for community health worker services to try to improve, among other things, health and mental health care access. “We were very pleased with the inclusion of community health workers in a lot of the Biden administration funding during the emergency,” said Davis. “Now the goal – and the hope – is that that will [become] a permanent part of our health structure.”",News/US news,‘Failure of an American ideology’: why Covid has an outsized impact on the US,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/15/us-public-health-healthcare-covid-society
5/15/2022,"More than one million people have died in the Covid-19 pandemic in the US, according to Johns Hopkins, far and away the most deaths of any country. While the sheer number of deaths from the coronavirus sets the US apart, the country’s large population of 332.5 million people does not explain the staggering mortality rate, which is among the highest in the world. For every 100,000 residents, 291 people have died from Covid-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Among the 20 worst affected nations, only two other countries – Brazil and Poland – have higher mortality rates per 100,000 people. Deaths directly attributable to Covid-19 are only one measure of the pandemic’s toll. Deaths from drug overdoses hit a record high in 2021, killing at least 100,000 Americans. Chronic conditions such as heart disease, hypertension and dementia have contributed to the number of “excess deaths” – a number which includes other ailments exacerbated by the pandemic, as well as those deaths caused directly by Covid-19. This number crossed the one million threshold in mid-February. The extraordinary toll has set the US apart among wealthy, peer nations, exposing inequality, a unique and fragmented health system, and polarized politics – all of which likely made the crisis worse, researchers said. “In terms of understanding why we had such a bad experience from the pandemic, we have to think about the systemic issues that already were in place when the pandemic arrived,” said Steven Woolf, a social epidemiologist and population health researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University. “And, on top of that, mishandling of the pandemic by the government and by the public, frankly.” The pandemic shone a light on longstanding racial and ethnic health disparities, as Black, Latino and Native American people were infected, hospitalized and died of Covid-19 at rates that were, at times, double those of white Americans. The drivers of those outcomes – the disproportionate likelihood for people of color to lack the same quality housing, employment and healthcare access as white Americans – are well known and documented. Such disparities are the “intended or unintended consequences of policy decisions”, a recent commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association said. The US has nonetheless had difficulty correcting course. Vaccines were at first slow to reach minority, low-income and rural areas. One recent study has shown how at least one advanced Covid-19 therapy, monoclonal antibodies, were the least likely to reach the highest risk patients for whom they are recommended. “It just exacerbated the struggles we currently have and pulled back the curtain on all the issues we’ve been dealing with for so many years,” said Terrence Shirley, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi. Community health centers help treat indigent and marginalized Americans who cannot pay for healthcare. The all-consuming nature of the pandemic has also allowed preventable and treatable infectious diseases to flourish. Thousands of young children, particularly in low-income households, have fallen behind on routine vaccinations. Rates of sexually transmitted diseases have reached the “highest numbers in American history”, as overwhelmed and underfunded local health agencies reallocated resources to Covid-19. Meanwhile, the mental health of adolescents in particular has suffered, as millions were cut off from the mental health services provided by schools. Pediatricians, children’s hospitals and psychiatrists declared a mental health crisis among the nation’s youth, and a recent CDC study has shown how emergency room visits for eating disorders has increased dramatically among adolescent girls. Millions of children were also thrust into food insecurity, as the numbers of children receiving school meals plummeted. Missed academic time appears to have caused the educational achievement gap to widen. “The US has been experiencing worse health outcomes for some years now. Life expectancy in the US is the lowest of any high income country,” said Woolf. “There’s a set of reasons for it, but all of those rolled right into the pandemic.” However, America’s reliance on an expensive, private and exclusionary health system is not solely to blame. Although policies that exclude 28 million uninsured individuals from healthcare have likely made things worse, they are only one example of how fragmented policy has worsened Americans’ health. Concepts fundamental to US governance also proved problematic in the pandemic. In just one example, the US Constitution makes public health the responsibility of individual states, creating a patchwork of different pandemic responses. Culture and environment also appear played a role. Americans are more likely than citizens of other countries to engage in what public health researchers consider risky behavior, such as gun ownership, smoking, consuming more calories and exercising less. Polarized politics make it more difficult to implement guardrails on these behaviors. Floundering responses by federal, state and local governments compounded existing issues, and eventually allowed pandemic-related public health guidance to become political and cultural footballs. Less than two-thirds of Republicans have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, compared with 91% of Democrats, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s January 2022 vaccine tracking poll. The only thing both parties appear to agree on, according to the same poll, is how the pandemic has exhausted them. That has led to another riddle – as more and more pandemic prevention measures are dropped, Americans will be faced with how to live with a disease that can be chronic and disabling, even if it isn’t as deadly. “Death is not the only serious outcome from Covid,” said David Putrino, the Director of Rehabilitation Innovation for Mount Sinai Health System. Putrino has seen thousands of cases of so-called “long Covid”, where many varied and at times severe symptoms persist for months. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found the syndrome resulted in an estimated 1.2 million more disabled people in 2021. “We are addressing the acute illness,” said Shirley, “and not resolving the issues that could prevent the illness in the first place”.",News/World news,"US Covid deaths hit 1m, a death toll higher than any other country",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/1-million-us-covid-deaths-effects
5/15/2022,"In the middle of the night on 20 August last year, Gordon Robertson received a phone call from the Florida highway patrol. The officer had pulled over his brother, Bruce, who was disoriented and claimed he was coming to see him. “I’m thinking, that’s really odd: I had told him he was not allowed to come up here and visit until he got vaccinated,” said Gordon, 71, who lives in Longwood. “I asked him a dozen times, ‘Bruce, you gotta get this. You gotta get this.’ And he wouldn’t do it.” It was the beginning of a story that highlights the impact of the Covid-19 tragedy in the US. From social distancing to vaccine disagreements or an inability to visit people who were sick in the hospital, a common symptom of the pandemic was human separation – sometimes permanent, in the case of the roughly 1 million Americans that Covid has now killed. Many of those losses have been especially hard precisely because of the separations involved – not only because family and friends couldn’t be with victims before they died but also because many couldn’t go through the usual grieving rituals afterwards. According to experts who study grief, the toll of the virus counts not just the 1 million deaths, but the immeasurable isolation that accompanied them. And for the people who died unvaccinated by choice, the sorrow among those who knew them was tempered by frustration that the deaths could have been prevented. In Bruce Robertson’s case, his life before Covid was the opposite of isolated. He lived in Lakeland, Florida, and worked for AT&T for years before he retired. He would walk several miles each day and was in good health, his brother recalled. He volunteered in the kitchen at a Seventh-day Adventist church, feeding homeless people. And he watched The Jim Bakker Show. A streaming program hosted by the infamous televangelist, it falsely touted “silver solution” as a cure for Covid. Bruce concluded that he didn’t need the vaccine. “He said, ‘I’m going to live to 100,’” Gordon recalled. So Gordon politely insisted that he not visit until vaccinated – which made the phone call from Florida highway patrol so baffling. The officer drove Bruce home, Gordon said, and the next day a friend went to Bruce’s house to discover a lawnmower in the middle of the yard. Bruce answered the door not fully clothed. Inside, food was spoiling on the kitchen counter. The friend called 911. At the hospital, Bruce was diagnosed with Covid. A nurse told Gordon that his brother’s delirium was a symptom of the virus, and that it was common among infected older adults. Bruce insisted to Gordon that he had a little cough but otherwise felt fine. “He said, ‘I hate it here. There’s no sports on TV,’ and that’s the last thing he said to me,” Gordon said. The next day the nurse told Gordon that his brother was on oxygen. A day later, the nurse said he had a blood clot in one of his lungs. They could intubate him but he would be in intense pain. The family agreed to just make him comfortable. Gordon has mixed feelings about not seeing his brother before he died: his stepson also had health issues, and he felt he needed to protect him. “I just couldn’t take the chance that [Bruce] might have” the virus, Gordon said. “I felt kind of guilty, that maybe I should have seen him before he got sick. But it was kind of his choice, and I couldn’t do anything about that. You can’t make people do what they don’t want to do.” Adapting to Covid deaths had been made exponentially harder, experts said, because people couldn’t watch their loved ones die. Geraldine Smith, whose husband died before vaccines were available, has spent much of the pandemic trying to educate people in St Louis about the virus and vaccines. Her husband, Carl, was a pastor who founded New Beginning Missionary Baptist church in North St Louis county in 1997 while also working as a police detective; he had started a narcotics training program for local teachers and parents. “My husband was a pastor who met the people where they were,” including in the streets, Smith said. On 29 March 2020, the pastor was delivering a sermon online when Smith noticed sweat pouring from his brow. She didn’t feel well, either. “After he completed his sermon, I told him, ‘Something’s wrong,’ ” Smith recalled. They went to ER and were tested for Covid, but it took two days to get the results. Doctors discharged Geraldine but kept Carl because his heart was racing. On the third day, after his heart rate returned to normal, she returned to take him home. Carl told her, “I’ve lived a good life.” “I kept wondering why he said that to me,” she said. A couple of days later, her own condition worsened. She called 911 and an ambulance brought her to Christian hospital in north St Louis county. “I stayed there for 25 days, and I did not know that I was in this world,” she recalled. Doctors eventually woke her up from an induced coma, and told her that Carl had died. “It was devastating – but the reason why it was so devastating was that I was not able to be with him,” Smith said. Smith’s reaction has been a common one during the pandemic, said Mary-Frances O’Connor, a psychologist who researches grief at the University of Arizona. “Many people have not been able to spend time at the bedside in a hospital or long-term care facility, and that is very unusual for human beings – not to be able to provide that care,” O’Connor said. “People I have been doing research with just tell me, ‘It feels like it hasn’t sunk in. She was here, and now she’s not here, and I didn’t get to see anything in between.’” Smith eventually came to terms with it as best she could. She continues to experience fatigue and short-term memory loss but now works at Show Me Hope, a crisis counseling program – and said she now understands why her husband told her he had lived a good life. “He had done his work, and God had said, ‘It’s time. Come on home and get your rest.’ God makes those decisions, and I accepted God’s decision,” she said. Kim Bell saw multiple deaths a week. A nurse at Saint Anne’s hospital in Fall River, Massachusetts, she had plenty of experience with death from working in a cancer unit. “No one is ready in America” to die, said Bell, 58. “But it doesn’t have to be bad. I always say to people, ‘I can make sure your dad is comfortable. I am more worried about you.’ It’s a whole family thing.” When the pandemic struck, the hospital converted her unit for Covid patients. They started losing about five patients a week, she said. Bell and many of her colleagues became depressed. Her doctor prescribed her an antidepressant, which she said helped. A Journal of General Internal Medicine study published in December found that among 500 doctors, nurses and first responders surveyed, 74% reported symptoms of depression; 37% reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder; and 15% reported thoughts of suicide or self-harm. “I don’t know what being a soldier is like, but it really did feel like being a soldier. You were exhausted, scrappy, dirty, sad, overworked. You never knew what you were going to walk into,” said Bell, who also felt like she was “barely a parent” to her two children, one of whom also grew depressed. Just as Bell tried to help cancer patients’ families, she tried to do the same for Covid patients. One 53-year-old Portuguese woman who ended up in Bell’s unit stood out. “It was like going to see a friend,” Bell recalled. The woman had not been vaccinated because her son and daughter-in-law didn’t believe in it, she said. When she was eventually put on oxygen, the woman was “sweaty, panting and just looked scared”, Bell said. “More than once I heard her say, ‘My kids lied to me. They lied to me,’” about the vaccine. She did not survive. Later, when Bell spoke with the woman’s family, she said, “Please, for your mother’s sake – as a tribute to her – get your whole family vaccinated. Because she does regret it.” These days, Bell does not have many Covid patients. She no longer needs the personal protective equipment used throughout the pandemic. And she no longer is depressed. “It just feels so much easier. We can breathe again,” Bell said of not needing all the PPE. “I don’t know how I got used to not breathing for those long days.” For Gordon, things are not much easier. His brother’s death still feels unresolved. “The thing missing from my brother’s death was the absence of closure,” Gordon said. “It seemed, and continues to seem, unreal. No family gathered to say goodbye, no memorialization due to Covid restrictions.” The terrible strangeness of it was only underlined when another tragedy struck the family. In January of this year, his wife Linda’s son, Stephen, died in his chair while watching television. He was 50 years old. The family suspects a heart attack. They are planning a memorial service to celebrate Stephen’s life, Gordon said – while in his brother’s case, there was only a small service at his church, which Gordon didn’t find out about until later. He wouldn’t have gone anyway, he said: it was the height of the Delta surge. Today, he has a third dog: his stepson’s. When his neighbors would remark on the new companion, and he told them the sad story, he learned four of them had also lost their adult children. People dropped off food and cards. “It makes neighbors become real neighbors again, which kind of was a lost art for a while – probably because of the pandemic,” Gordon said. As a semi-retired consultant for car dealerships, he continues to hear stories – about salespeople, parts department workers and office staff who have died. “It’s just been an awful couple years,” he said. “I don’t think people realize that every one of that ‘million’ number is attached to two, four, 20 people – so you’re talking 50 million people. “Who knows how many people this affected?”",News/World news,What made America’s Covid death toll even worse: the gnawing pain of human separation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/covid-coronavirus-1m-deaths-separation-isolation
5/15/2022,"If you have ever wondered from where the death-row lawyer Clive Stafford Smith gets his intransigent, crusading spirit, this vivid, inquiring memoir provides much of the evidence. It is set up as a book not about its author but about the lives of two very different men who helped to define him. The first is Stafford Smith’s father, Dick, a wildly volatile man with bipolar disorder, who squandered the family fortune and blamed everyone but himself. The second is Larry Lonchar, an inmate in Georgia State Prison facing a capital sentence, one of the many men for whom Stafford Smith has acted as advocate and sometime saviour in the past 40 years. The lawyer’s examination of these two doomed lives, and his own role in them, expands into a compulsive personal investigation into the limits of empathy, and the proper balance of responsibility and retribution toward the destructive actions of men not in their best minds. Dick Stafford Smith, whose death in 2007 first prompted this book, was in some ways the blueprint for all of the prisoners lost in the American justice system, for whom his son petitioned mercy: a man burdened with a temperamental makeup entirely unsuited to the circumstances of his adult life. Haunted by his failure to fathom his father, still less to help him, Stafford Smith explores how he went in search of the most extreme kinds of “save-able” surrogates elsewhere. Not for nothing did he call his charity Reprieve. At 18, Stafford Smith fled to university in the US – and you don’t blame him for trying to escape home as soon as he could. His voyage around his father is a portrait drawn in impossible violent extremes. Dick Stafford Smith inherited the oldest horse-racing stud in England – Cheveley Park Stud – from his father (whose own inheritance, it emerges, derived from a clandestine gay relationship with Cheveley’s previous owner). With his alternating moods of black despair and insomniac megalomania, Dick Stafford Smith could hardly have fallen into a less suitable role. Staking everything on risky stallions, and ever more grandiose plans and schemes, his behaviour became increasingly erratic. Stafford Smith first realised the extent of it when, aged seven, his father called him into his study and thrust £200 into his hand – about “66 years worth of pocket money”, he later recalls calculating – before informing him that from now on he was on his own, and needed to look for a place to rent. Later, after he is dispatched to boarding school, he receives a letter from his father, one of many wild and whirling missives, in which he and his brother – in between catalogues of their failings as sons and human beings – are instructed to urgently find £30,000 (about £500,000 in today’s money) in order to buy out their aunt’s interest in the stud. Stafford Smith finds useful ways to parallel this kind of behaviour with the choices that have led, in far less privileged circumstances, to death row. Larry Lonchar was convicted of three murders in a botched extortion plot in 1987. In investigating his biography in search of mitigation for these crimes, Stafford Smith unearthed a catalogue of neglect and abuse in Lonchar’s childhood that led him to inescapable depression and gambling addiction, and a desire to seek certainty in incarceration for an escalating series of crimes. The logical conclusion of this journey, it becomes clear to Stafford Smith, was Lonchar’s determination to take responsibility for murders there was reason to believe he did not commit, in order for the state to take his life: suicide by electric chair. It is a measure of the lawyer’s messianic faith in the sanctity of life at all costs that he defers this outcome over eight long years. To begin with, the comparison between the life of his father and Lonchar may seem strained. Stafford Smith traces the progression of his father’s mania, after his estrangement from all of his family, in the cache of thousands of letters he left behind – sent to bishops and politicians as well as to his ex-wives and children. Despite his loneliness and paranoia, his cruelties and rudeness, Dick Stafford Smith’s “crimes” are of a different order of magnitude to Lonchar’s. As the book progresses, however, I found myself increasingly persuaded of the principles that Stafford Smith tries to establish: that forms of madness represent not deviations from “normality” but a spectrum on which we all live; that the more desperate a person’s material circumstances, the more likely it is that “antisocial personality disorders” will result in devastating outcomes. The question then becomes: how do we understand those actions and judge them? There are biographical details that link his two subjects’ history of trauma – childhood accidents that leave them in comas, likely PTSD as a result of proximity to violence (Dick Stafford Smith served in the RAF in Italy as a navigator during the war; Lonchar witnessed almost daily acts of brutal domestic violence). The thread that knits these stories, however, is the author’s increasing anxiety about his own psychological makeup; those characteristics he routinely channels into 20-hour days, driving insanely between appeal courts and prisons in the pursuit of clemency, coming up with ever-crazier strategies to get stays of execution. His father calls him “Chip”, as in “off the old block”. He too is scarred by childhood. “I send you away to school,” his father tells him, “because I don’t have the courage to beat you myself.” One result is that “by the age of 12 I didn’t do emotion any more”. In unpicking this history within himself, in what is a properly soul-searching book, Stafford Smith finds useful ways to ask the hardest of questions about crime and punishment. If we follow him in trying to face those questions, he argues, “We might even begin to treat people we don’t know in the same way we would treat those we love”.

5/15/2022,"As tokenistic and implausible policies go, it’s hard to beat the concept of “street votes”, flagged up in last week’s Queen’s speech in order to “fix the country’s housing problems”, as the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat put it. The idea is that mini-referendums can be held whereby residents of a given street can, if an “overwhelming” majority agrees, decide to enlarge and extend their properties and develop back alleys or other scraps of land. This might sound fine in theory, but the detail is vague, probably because there are many devils in it. How do you draw the boundary that says who votes and who doesn’t? What is the definition of “overwhelming”? Who organises and pays for these votes? As the countryside charity CPRE has pointed out, a mini-boom in loft conversions and back extensions is likely to lead to more residential space for those who already have enough, rather than for those in dire need of somewhere decent to live. The government’s emphasis on this policy, whose benefits will be at best marginal, suggests that it has all but given up on seriously addressing housing need or achieving the 300,000 new homes a year that it pledged in the 2019 manifesto. Indeed, the housing secretary, Michael Gove, has hinted that he might be drifting away on this target. The important question is: what might actually make a difference to the neverendingly intractable problem of housing? A large part of the answer is the one thing that this government has not attempted, because it is ideologically and organisationally inhibited from doing so, which is positive public intervention in the planning and building of homes and communities. (We are talking here, it should be noted, about England only, as the other countries of the union have devolved planning policies). Such intervention does not mean loosening the bolts on the planning system so as to entice a few more units from private housebuilders, but the creation of plans that identify where new homes might be beneficial, combined with practical support for designs that are environmentally, socially and visually successful. It also means making sites viable through such things as assembling land, providing infrastructure and decontaminating pollution and building the homes of the type and number that people need. The private sector has consistently proved incapable of doing this, as builders have little incentive to lower the value of their products by greatly expanding the supply. It is not fantastical that modern government, both national and local, could act like this. It happens in other countries. There is a precedent for such intervention in Britain, in the postwar programme of building new towns, which created 32 towns in 20 years, where 2.8 million people now live. Although often sneered at, places such as Milton Keynes continue to grow and receive high satisfaction ratings from their residents. New towns were achieved, what is more, at little or no cost to the exchequer, as they were funded by compulsorily purchasing land and then capturing the increase in value that comes when agricultural or other types of land receive planning permission. At present, the planning system, especially in rural areas, is a lottery: landowners who can get permission see the value of their property multiply many times. Rather than fund the pensions and holiday homes of such lucky landowners, this uplift can help pay for public benefits. The main obstacle to housing growth is the often well-founded mistrust of new development by the people who have to live near it, often known as nimbys. They can see that it brings little benefit to them and blights their view with poorly designed buildings. If the capture of increases in land value meant that there truly was more housing available for their children, or that it paid for schools, at least some of the opposition would fade away. No one should pretend that any of this is easy. It is fantasy to think that the competing interests of people who already own homes and those desperate for somewhere to live can always be reconciled without hard decisions. On the other hand, much of the machinery for coherent and constructive actions already exists. We have government powers, for such things as compulsory purchase and strategic planning, and an apparatus of local authority planners, albeit one weakened by cuts in funding. There are means for building publicly funded housing and capturing uplift. Local authorities are indeed building homes and sometimes schools are paid for by development. What is lacking is any kind of coordinated determination to use these means effectively and at sufficient scale. The political will that goes into motorways, high-speed railways and airports is lacking when it comes to housing. Curiously, the seeming localism of the street votes concept is combined, in the new levelling-up and regeneration bill, with what the Town and Country Planning Association calls a power grab by central government; changes proposed in the bill will, it says, mean that there will be “no limit” to the secretary of state’s ability to overrule local authorities. In one reading, this could be a prelude to decisive and intelligent action under the benign dictatorship of Gove. More probably, we will get the worst of all worlds: ineffectiveness, uncertainty, poor consultation, the destruction of public trust and cosmetic democracy. There clearly is housing need in this country, which brings both human misery and economic damage. There is colossal wealth locked up in the development potential of land. There are legitimate public fears about development. The means exist to use the wealth to address the need while allaying the fears, but there is not much to suggest that this will happen. Tugendhat fears that the Tories will face “electoral oblivion” if they don’t fix the housing problem. They would deserve to do so.

5/15/2022,"Last week, the government outlined details of its long-overdue legislation for easing restrictions on gene-editing farm animals and plants. Current regulations, inherited from the European Union, effectively block all crop strains and animal breeds created through DNA modification. In an overpopulated, overheated world that desperately needs secure food supplies and to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, such barriers should no longer be allowed to restrict progress. We urgently need solutions and Britain, one of the world’s leaders in animal and plant research, must be free to play a key role in this agricultural revolution. Blanket bans of genetically altered crops and animals can be countenanced no longer. To that extent, the government has moved in the right direction, although the degree of change it proposes is unsatisfactory. The forthcoming genetic technology (precision breeding) bill, outlined in the Queen’s speech last week, will introduce a regulatory regime for releasing gene-edited crops and animals. Sensibly, these will now be treated in the same way as those produced by conventional means. However, there is no mention of similar allowances being made for animals created by genetic modification (GM), a technology with a broader range of applications than gene-editing. The latter uses techniques for altering DNA in a plant or animal without adding new genetic material. In contrast, GM technology operates by introducing an entire new gene to create a new strain or breed. Blight-resistant potatoes and crops that can make omega-3 nutrients have been developed in this way but, as the government’s proposals stand, they will not be eligible for release under its proposed new regulatory regime and their introduction will continue to be obstructed. Such restrictions are unnecessary and will have an unfortunate impact in preventing crops such as the blight-proof potato from helping farmers cut the amount of pesticide that they spray on fields to keep them free from disease. Similarly, blocking the growth of crops that are rich in omega-3 will stop a fresh source of nutrients from coming to the aid of a starving planet. At its heart, this refusal to loosen our GM restrictions reveals misguided government thinking. It continues to block a range of new agricultural products because they have been created using a particular scientific procedure, regardless of the fact that the end result may be safe to grow and eat. This state of affairs originally arose as the outcome of the decades-old controversy that erupted over the creation of the first GM crops. The unfounded claim that these “Frankenfoods” were “unnatural” and a danger to human health and the environment has led to the vilification of an entire technology. However, as the Royal Society has emphasised, agricultural varieties and breeds should be regulated on their intrinsic properties rather than the method used to create them. In other words, the outcome of genetic changes made during a new strain or breed’s creation should be judged on safety, welfare and environmental considerations. If they pass, they should proceed to market, regardless of the manner of their creation. Failure to pursue such an approach will hamper the government’s goal of “improving the sustainability, resilience and productivity of agricultural systems”, which, it claims, will be the major benefits from its new bill. At present, it has outlined legislation that is strong on aspiration but very limited in the kind of detail that shows it fully understands the urgency and scale of the problems we face.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on reforming the restrictions on GM foods | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/observer-view-reforming-restrictions-on-gm-foods
