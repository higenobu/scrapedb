3/1/2022,"Hello, I’m Warren Murray with Tuesday morning’s essential reading. Russia has assembled a military convoy north-west of Kyiv that stretches for 40 miles, according to satellite images, as a major assault by Vladimir Putin’s forces on the Ukrainian capital appears increasingly likely. It is reported this morning that more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed after Russian artillery hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, while video showed fires at a military base that was hit by an air strike in the city of Brovary, 25km north-east of the capital. Russian forces have been accused of unleashing terrifyingly destructive thermobaric weapons, also known as “vacuum bombs”, which Ukraine has condemned as a breach of the Geneva conventions. “Dozens” of civilians have died in Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv after “horrendous” heavy bombardment by Russian forces in the past 24 hours, according to local officials. Footage shows Grad missiles raining down on the city. The international criminal court’s prosecutor has announced that he will launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine. The office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) has reported at least 406 civilian casualties, including at least 102 dead. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, has signed an official request for Ukraine to join the EU. A senior EU official said leaders might discuss it at an informal summit in March. Ukraine has opened its border to foreigners willing to fight, and Zelenskiy has issued a decree temporarily lifting requirements for entry visas. Boris Johnson will fly to Nato’s border with Russia today to meet leaders of Poland and Estonia, and to visit British troops. The US is expelling 12 members of Russia’s UN mission, accusing them of having “abused their privileges” by engaging in espionage that is harmful to national security. Earlier, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN read out a text message exchange said to be between a Russian soldier in Ukraine and his mother shortly before he was killed. A campaign to save independent Ukrainian media from the war is gathering pace – the Kyiv Independent is spearheading the raising of money to help journalists relocate operations from Kyiv to neighbouring capitals. Further developments are being covered at our live blog. NICs rethink urged – Rishi Sunak is facing renewed pressure from business leaders to delay a planned £12bn rise in national insurance as the Russian invasion of Ukraine drives up inflation. The manufacturing trade body Make UK warned the government that pressing ahead would risk firms slamming the brakes on recruitment and putting the economic recovery from Covid at risk. Economists have said UK inflation could rise from the current 5.5% to peak above 8% within months – the highest level for three decades. Ahead of Sunak’s spring economic forecast this month, the Confederation of British Industry has urged the chancellor to set out tax cuts and spending commitments to offset the impact on firms. ‘We need justice’ – The family of Sasha Johnson have vowed to get justice after the collapse of the prosecution of four suspects over her shooting. Johnson, 28, who came to prominence through Black Lives Matter, was shot in the head in May 2021. Detectives believed she was hit by mistake after masked men burst into a party in a garden. Her mother, Ellet Dalling, urged those at the party to come forward with evidence: “Don’t go silent. These people that did this to Sasha need to come off the street.” SOTU debut – Joe Biden will deliver his first state of the union address today before a bitterly divided Congress, seeking to inspire a pandemic-weary nation unhappy with its leaders and government while projecting US strength after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Lauren Gambino writes. Biden will have to balance addressing the war with the domestic challenges most important to American voters – such as the economy, inflation and a stalled political agenda. Biden will be able to cite his $1.9tn stimulus package passed in 2021, and bipartisan infrastructure law, while calling for Congress to enact new measures designed to lower the costs of childcare, healthcare and prescription drugs. Biden will take the opportunity to tout his nominee for the supreme court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would be the first black woman to serve on that bench. ‘Let down by system’ – “Obstruction and delay” have scuppered investigations into police misconduct, MPs have warned. The home affairs select committee’s report on the IOPC watchdog found there is little public confidence that complaints are likely to succeed or result in proper sanctions against officers. The committee said complainants had been left “feeling let down by a system failing to treat their complaints with the severity they merited”. The IOPC took over police misconduct complaints in England and Wales from the Independent Police Complaints Commission four years ago. Muscles for life – Half an hour per week of muscle strengthening activity such as weights, push-ups or heavy gardening could help reduce the risk of dying from any cause by 10-20%, according to a global analysis of studies conducted over three decades. The analysis covered participants varying in age from 18 to 97. Joint analysis of muscle strengthening and aerobic activities showed the reduction in risk of death from any cause, heart disease and cancer was even greater when these two types of activities were combined: 40%, 46% and 28% lower, respectively. When the comic actor Volodymyr Zelenskiy ran for the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, he was treated as a joke. Now, as Luke Harding reports from Lviv, he personifies the defiance and dignity of Ukraine’s embattled population.

But is this world-class arts centre in danger of being turned into a shopping mall? Fifa and Uefa have acted in unison to suspend Russian teams from international football competition as global sport closed the door on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be prevented from competing in international events. Jesse Marsch has been confirmed as the new head coach of Leeds United, after the struggling Premier League club moved swiftly to replace Marcelo Bielsa. Dan Lawrence appears poised to resume his Test career against West Indies in Antigua next week after being preferred to Ollie Pope in the rebooted England team that begins its solitary warm-up match on Tuesday. British boxing authorities have confirmed an investigation into the scoring of Josh Taylor’s controversial victory over Jack Catterall. The English Football League has asked Derby’s administrators for an “urgent update” on how the club will be funded for the rest of the season. And Steve Borthwick has underlined the effort and sacrifices made by the Leicester scrum-half Ben Youngs in order to break the England men’s appearance record. Asian shares have been rising today – benchmarks were higher in early trading in Tokyo, Sydney and Shanghai. Hong Kong declined and markets were closed in South Korea for a holiday. US futures edged lower and oil prices rose. The Russian rouble has plunged to record lows. Futures trading suggests the FTSE will open lower while the pound is worth $1.341 and €1.197 at time of writing. Our Guardian page one lead is “Russia’s deadly raids defy sanctions and peace talks”. The i has “Putin bombs civilians”. Most of the front pages are aghast at the killing of civilians by the military of Russia and furious at its president: “Show this to Putin” – the Metro echoes the words of a Ukrainian ambulance officer who tried in vain to save a wounded six-year-old girl, who is not named. The Telegraph’s headline is the same. A number of papers use pictures of a schoolgirl named Polina, killed with her parents and brother in Kyiv. “Her name was Polina”, says the Sun. “Fight for the innocents”, says the Mirror, branding Putin “a coward who kills little girls in slippers and unicorn pyjamas”. The Express puts it bluntly: “Monstrous”. The Times has “‘Barbaric’ strikes on Ukraine”. “Humanity – and Putin’s inhumanity” – the Mail contrasts its reader fundraising campaign with the Russian president’s war. “Russian rockets pound Kharkiv”, says the Financial Times of the assault on Ukraine’s second-largest city.

3/1/2022,"China has reacted angrily to calls by Japan’s influential former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, for Tokyo to consider hosting US nuclear weapons in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising concern over Chinese aggression towards Taiwan. Abe, who presided over record defence budgets before resigning in 2020, said Japan should cast off taboos surrounding its possession of nuclear weapons following the outbreak of war in Europe. “In Nato, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy take part in nuclear sharing, hosting American nuclear weapons,” Abe said in a TV interview, according to Nikkei Asia. “We need to understand how security is maintained around the world and not consider it taboo to have an open discussion. “We should firmly consider various options when we talk about how we can protect Japan and the lives of its people in this reality.” Japan, the only country to have been attacked with nuclear weapons, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is part of the US nuclear umbrella but has for decade adhered to the three non-nuclear principles – that it will not produce or possess nuclear weapons or allow them on its territory. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, quickly rejected Abe’s call for a debate on the nuclear-sharing option. “It is unacceptable given our country’s stance of maintaining the three non-nuclear principles,” Kishida, who represents a constituency in Hiroshima, told MPs this week. Wang Wenbin, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing: “Japanese politicians have frequently spread fallacies related to Taiwan and even blatantly made false remarks that violate the nation’s three non-nuclear principles. “We strongly ask Japan to deeply reflect on its history”, Wang added, and warned Tokyo to “be cautious in words and deeds on the Taiwan issue to stop provoking trouble”. Under Abe, a conservative whose lifelong political ambition is to revise Japan’s “pacifist” constitution, said any conflict involving China and Taiwan would also constitute an emergency for Japan. He called on the US to end its “ambiguity” on the defence of Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, noting that the island is just 110 km from Yonaguni, Japan’s westernmost inhabited island. “The US takes a strategy of ambiguity, meaning it may or may not intervene militarily if Taiwan is attacked,” Abe said. “By showing it may intervene, it keeps China in check, but by leaving open the possibility that it may not intervene, it makes sure that the Taiwanese forces for independence do not get out of control.” Abe, leader of the biggest faction in Kishida’s ruling Liberal Democratic party, has made several hawkish interventions on security policy that enjoy support inside the party but could provoke a backlash among voters nervous about Japan’s potential involvement in regional conflicts. China’s state-run tabloid Global Times accused Abe of attempting to “unlock” Japanese militarism. “It is not only ironic, but also a huge real risk, that a group of people in the only country in the world that was bombed by atomic bombs would call for an invitation to the culprit to deploy nuclear weapons in their own territory,” it said in an editorial.",News/World news,China rattled by calls for Japan to host US nuclear weapons ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/china-rattled-by-calls-for-japan-to-host-us-nuclear-weapons
3/1/2022,"As the proportionally longest and narrowest country in the world – stretching over 33 degrees in latitude – or 4,200km – from north to south, Chile has its fair share of different climate zones. In the far south, including the island of Tierra del Fuego, shared with neighbouring Argentina, there is a strongly oceanic climate, with high rainfall – as much as 4,000mm (157 inches) a year – and prevailing westerly winds. Yet the main city, Punta Arenas, lies in the rain-shadow to the west, and so receives just 410mm (16 inches) of precipitation a year. Chile’s capital, Santiago, lies roughly in the centre of the country, has a more Mediterranean climate, with warm, dry and sunny summers and fairly cool winters; rainfall occurs mainly in the winter months, but is still very low – just 275mm (10.8 inches) a year. But it is the far north of the country that has the most extreme climate. The Atacama Desert is known as the driest place on the planet, where it hardly ever rains. The reason for this is the cold offshore ocean current, named after the European explorer Alexander von Humboldt, which prevents the formation of rain clouds. Further inland, in the Andes Mountains, the climate is also extremely dry, but much colder due to the high altitude: night-time temperatures can drop well below freezing.",News/News,Weatherwatch: the many climate zones of Chile,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/01/weatherwatch-many-climate-zones-chile
3/1/2022,"On Monday, as war in Ukraine caused turbulence in the European energy market, and just before the publication of the “bleakest warning yet” from scientists on the climate crisis, the UK’s secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, took to Twitter to set out his case for a clean energy future for the UK. It was a major intervention from the business secretary, at a vital juncture. Kwarteng is joining many of the biggest voices and leading experts in the UK energy industry in arguing for clean energy and rejecting fossil fuels. But this new emphasis from the government will need to be backed up by further policy and action if it is to mean real change. So what should we make of Kwarteng’s statements? The invasion of Ukraine has led to a huge upheaval of the energy markets, as the International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol predicted. Gas prices in Europe were already soaring, owing, in part, to Vladimir Putin’s tightening of gas supply to the EU – a move that now seems a clear precursor to his invasion aims. Germany has announced a suite of new energy policies alongside its historic foreign policy reversals, and the country’s Green party – in the ruling coalition – is even reconsidering its implacable opposition to nuclear power. EU nations are ramping up their low-carbon energy efforts, and businesses have been affected too: earlier this week BP gave up its stake in Rosneft, and on Monday Shell did the same with Gazprom. In the UK, the war has added impetus to the claims of many Conservative politicians and rightwing commentators, fuelled by soaring gas prices, that the UK must put off the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions in favour of fostering domestic fossil fuel supplies. Kwarteng’s statements, in response to these issues, acknowledge that North Sea oil and gas are totemic for many opponents of the UK’s net zero plans – the UK’s own fossil fuel resources are seen as a bulwark against energy insecurity and economic threats. However, this overlooks the fact that much of the UK’s production of North Sea oil and gas is sold overseas to the highest bidder – in fact, the amount exported doubled late last year. The UK has no gas supply issues, but what Kwarteng carefully leaves out is that the UK certainly does have a gas storage issue. The Conservative government decided in 2017 to allow the closure of major gas storage facilities, meaning that the UK now has puny storage capacity compared with EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. Being unable to store large quantities of gas makes the UK more dependent on imports and vulnerable to price shocks, like the current one. Kwarteng is absolutely right – but why then is he planning a big expansion of exploration in the North Sea? The Committee on Climate Change found last week that granting new licences to explore for oil and gas in the North Sea would do nothing to alleviate high prices, as those new fields would take decades to come into production. But although the CCC clearly “favoured” a moratorium on new licences, the government’s response made clear it was minded to press ahead with them anyway. Again, Kwarteng is right – those calling for a return to fracking as the answer to the UK’s energy problems are deluded. Fracking failed because the industrialisation of densely populated countryside for meagre returns was always a doubtful business in the UK. But it’s notable that Kwarteng, one of the authors of Britannia Unchained, chooses an entirely different argument to slap down the frackers – the fact that any gas produced would not reduce the market price. The UK led the dash for gas, and away from coal, in the 1990s, which is the main reason why UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen further and faster than many comparable developed countries over that time. But gas cannot be the long-term answer if we are to tackle the climate crisis. However, as the energy commentator Michael Liebreich also pointed out on Twitter on Monday, moving away from gas needs to be planned and carefully executed – otherwise, consumers will face price shocks. The UK could have ramped up renewable energy much sooner, but chose to rely on North Sea fossil fuels for much longer than necessary. Why does nuclear come first? Building new nuclear power stations will take even longer than new North Sea oil and gas fields, or new fracking wells. The only new nuclear power station currently being built in the UK, at Hinkley Point C in Somerset by French energy giant EDF, has taken the best part of two decades to move from planning to construction and is still years away from producing electricity. Financial backing for new nuclear is also in serious doubt, as critics say it is likely to be the most expensive form of generation. Again, Kwarteng is absolutely right: renewables are cheaper than gas. Onshore wind is one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy. Why then has the UK made onshore windfarms almost impossible to build in England? Solar prices have also plummeted. So why has the government failed to mandate solar panels on new housing, and reduced the incentives available for households to install them? The case for energy efficiency is abundantly clear. The UK has the leakiest housing stock in Europe, so insulation will cut energy bills, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make people healthier. But since the scrapping of the ill-administered green homes grant last April, households across England have been left without any assistance scheme. In fact, apart from the short-lived green homes grant scheme, there has been no nationwide insulation programme for the last seven years, and meanwhile more than 1m new homes have been built to high-carbon standards, and will have to be retrofitted. Ed Matthew, of the thinktank E3G, says: “The business secretary is right to flag that energy efficiency investment is the best way to bring down energy bills. There is potential to cut UK home energy use in half with energy efficiency. “But the £6bn the government has committed is only half of the investment needed to get on track to net zero and reach the target to end fuel poverty by 2030. The Ukraine crisis is a reminder of the price we pay due to our addiction to gas. “For energy security, for net zero, for energy bills, the solution is the same – we need a bold new infrastructure programme to insulate every UK home within a decade and massively accelerate the switch to electrified heat. There is no greater patriotic mission.” Jan Rosenow, director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, applauds Kwarteng’s intentions but says that the UK is coming at this from a slow start. “The government rightly identifies an expansion of renewables and home energy efficiency upgrades as important levers to move away from imported fossil gas,” he says. “Whilst on renewable energy the UK has achieved a lot and recent announcements of annual auctions are welcome, on energy efficiency the UK is trailing far behind its European neighbours. A well-funded, long-term energy efficiency programme is still nonexistent and this needs to change.” Nothing that Kwarteng says in this thread represents a departure in government policy. What’s important is that he has chosen to say it, at this time and in this way. He is not alone: Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who presided over the Cop26 climate summit last year, has repeatedly called for more climate action. Other Conservatives are also joining the fray: Samuel Hall of the Conservative Environment Network told Darren Grimes on GB News on Monday that renewables would work better than fracking in bringing bills down. These interventions have come amid renewed concern over the UK’s energy future, sparked by the war in Ukraine. They also come as a belated riposte to attempts by the right wing of the Tory party to turn net zero into a culture war. For months now, almost as soon as the last delegate departed from Cop26 in Glasgow last November, the UK’s right-leaning press has been full of attacks on the government’s climate policy by the opponents of net zero. The wounding of Boris Johnson in the partygate scandals gave rightwing Conservatives and commentators the opening they needed, as the “green agenda” has long been closely identified with the prime minister. Soaring energy prices fanned the flames. For Kwarteng now to take such a public stand in favour of green energy, slapping down fracking enthusiasts and deflating claims for North Sea gas, marks a significant ramping up of green rhetoric. Perhaps the fightback starts here.",News/Environment,"Kwasi Kwarteng’s stand for green energy isn’t everything, but it helps",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/01/kwasi-kwartengs-stand-for-green-energy-isnt-everything-but-it-helps
3/1/2022,"It looks like something from a wildly imaginative sci-fi comic, an impossible vision of worlds slamming into each other in a fantastical collage. Elevated walkways leap across the sky while a trio of towers rise up like serrated blades, their edges sawing at the clouds. Beneath them, fountains cascade and cafes spill across lush waterside terraces, while an art gallery and library jut out overhead. A tropical conservatory wraps around the top of a subterranean theatre, next to a cinema buried beneath a crescent of apartments. And the entire multilayered edifice floats above a 2,000-seat concert hall carved into the ground. This is no sci-fi comic, but a cutaway diagram of the Barbican arts centre dating from 1982, rendered in vivid orange, red and green. Somehow, this miraculous Escher-like wonder really did get built, and it hits 40 this month, with celebratory events and a handsome new book modestly titled Building Utopia. As well as charting the last four decades of performances, exhibitions and events staged in the bowels of this brutalist behemoth, the book sheds light on the battles that were fought to realise the entire Barbican project, not just its world-class arts centre. We learn about its long struggle for acceptance – and the intractable quirks that have plagued the development since opening. “It took more than a generation and a half to be constructed,” recalls Frank Woods, an architect who worked on the project, “another generation to be absorbed into the culture of the City and another to be regarded as an international model of its kind.” For some, this is a battle still to be won. The idea for the Barbican was driven by the need to save the Corporation of London from oblivion after the second world war had devastated the residential population of the Square Mile. By 1951, Cripplegate had a population of just 48 – a century earlier, it had been home to 14,000. Without residents and voters, the City faced losing its centuries-old powers and being absorbed into the wider London County Council. Imagined as a “city within a city”, the Barbican was concocted to lure well-heeled middle-class professionals into the centre, providing a utopian community for 4,000 residents, with unparalleled cultural facilities on tap, along with schools, a church, shops and pubs, all arranged around an artificial lake. The raw concrete look of the estate has led many to believe it was originally built as social housing, but it was nothing of the sort. The flats were designed to be high density and high value, to help pay for the vast cultural podium on which they stood. The arts centre – which trebled in size during the design process – would be buried, so as not to obstruct the view from the luxury apartments. An essay in the book by Elain Harwood, postwar specialist at Historic England, unpicks the evolution of the scheme, by the young architecture firm Chamberlin, Powell & Bon. “We strongly dislike the Garden City tradition,” the architects declared, “with its low density, monotony and waste of good country, road, kerbs, borders and paths in endless strips everywhere.” Instead, they wanted to make a “truly urban” place, inspired by their visit to Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation in Marseille. Harwood notes how they also drew on historical references, from the stark medieval towers of San Gimignano in Italy to the repeated barrel-arched roofs of the churches on the Greek island of Mykonos. The brick used at the lowest levels was a nod to the warehouse basements that had stood there until hit by Luftwaffe bombs. The result was a beguiling cocktail – part bastion, part brutalist hanging gardens of Babylon – and it stood as the ultimate expression of the modern movement’s search for a monument. As the Architects’ Journal put it: “The Barbican, now it is completed, has all the aspects – gigantisms, singleness of purpose – of that bygone age when architects had the confidence (or naivety) to believe that monumentality had a place in architecture – and that part of their job was the imposition of discipline and order on the users of the buildings.” By the time it was finally finished in the 1980s, such modernist dogma was anathema. Massively delayed and hugely over budget, the Barbican was seen by many as a concrete albatross around the City’s neck. In one heated, high-level debate, a city official argued that the money would have been better spent on prisons. The Aberdeen Press and Journal’s review was typical of the reaction to the opening in 1982: “From the outside, the much-publicised Barbican Centre hardly looks like £152m worth” – a figure that would be almost £600m in today’s money. Once inside, however, the reviewer was won over. “The overpowering imagination, skill and effort which has gone into the 25-year project becomes apparent immediately. It is engrained in the pine-clad walls, the polished teak flooring, the subtle lighting, the overall design. In fact, the Barbican has been described as ‘a haven of cultural perfection in the midst of the City of London.’” Christoph Bon, the Swiss architect of the trio, had been adamant that fixtures and fittings in the public areas should be as luxurious as possible. As a result, visitors glide over end-grain wood-block flooring, run their fingers along polished brass handrails and lounge inside the Peruvian walnut cocoon of the theatre – materials all chosen to contrast with the artfully rugged surface of the pick-hammered concrete walls. There were innovations at every turn, like the fact that each row of theatre seating had its very own door – a boon for latecomers trying to sneak to their seats. And latecomers did not always have themselves to blame. The complexity of incorporating so many venues on so many levels across a 40-acre site has always made the place an infuriating labyrinth for the uninitiated, with successive decades of signage and way-finding strategies deployed in an attempt to ease the maze-like passageways. Even before the arts centre opened, it had garnered a reputation as impossibly difficult to navigate. One official advertising poster even quipped: “If Helen Mirren can find the new Barbican Centre before it opens in March, she will be appearing there in A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” While not shying away from the Barbican’s more dysfunctional sides, the book contains some eye-opening recollections from those who have had to endure its back-of-house areas, including actor Fiona Shaw, who arrived when the Royal Shakespeare Company’s tenure here was only two seasons old. “Its early reputation among the RSC actors was as a very luxurious but terrifying building,” she writes, describing how the stage door was “hidden like an afterthought”, and how actors spent their time “lost on the staircases and the inhospitable corridors”, forced to rehearse in underground rooms “like canaries in a mine”. Some of these enduring idiosyncrasies are part of the reason why the Barbican recently launched a £150m architectural competition, to seek “a new vision for a global icon”. Fans of the place have good reason to be wary. There have been many past attempts to tame the beast, most of which have come a cropper. In the early 1990s, Theo Crosby of Pentagram was charged with creating a new look for the centre, which introduced pastel colours and gilded fibreglass statues in a bizarre whimsical pastiche – derided as “feeble tinkering” by Geoffrey Powell, one of the original trio. Gillian Darley’s review in the Observer was damning: “Crosby’s peculiar attempts to jolly up the Barbican suggest a damp squib of a student project rather than a scheme drawn up by an international design group.” Another rebranding project in 2000 prompted the Guardian to note: “The world’s most bewildering arts centre is solving the problem of its notorious signs once and for all – by getting rid of most of them.” But this latest venture rings louder alarm bells still. While admirably aiming to improve the accessibility and sustainability of the complex, the brief also talks of “a huge opportunity to bring currently under-utilised spaces to life … in support of our creative and commercial ambitions”. It sounds suspiciously like a euphemism for turning it into a mall. The shortlist of architects charged with coming up with “bold” and “radical” solutions includes David Adjaye, Bjarke Ingels and Diller Scofidio + Renfro, a starry cast known neither for their subtlety nor their sensitive restorations of postwar buildings. The Barbican may be a great hulking brute, but it is a carefully composed, grade II-listed one. It demands delicate intervention with a lightness of touch – not more shops squeezed into every available cranny.",Arts/Art and design,"‘A brutalist hanging gardens of Babylon’ – the maddening, miraculous Barbican hits 40",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/01/brutalist-hanging-gardens-babylon-maddening-miraculous-barbican-hits-40-mall
3/1/2022,"Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address on Tuesday before a bitterly divided Congress, seeking to inspire a pandemic-weary nation deeply unhappy with its leaders and government, while projecting strength to the world after Russia unleashed the largest land war in Europe since the second world war. The prime-time address comes at a precarious moment for Biden and the world. Speaking in the House chamber, Biden will interrupt harrowing coverage of combat in a European capital, as evidence builds that Russian attacks are striking civilian areas and Russian president, Vladimir Putin, threatens nuclear war. It is a starkly different backdrop than White House officials had anticipated when they began drafting the speech, which typically draws millions of viewers. “There’s no question that this speech is a little different than it would have been just a few months ago,” White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters on Monday. Finalized between situation room meetings and calls with allies, Biden will attempt to deliver an address that balances the crisis with domestic challenges that polling shows are most important to American voters, such as the economy, inflation and a stalled domestic agenda. He has already warned that sanctions on Russia could cause oil prices to rise further. US inflation is already at its highest in decades. The president, Psaki said, would use the opportunity to emphasize American leadership and to lay out his efforts to “rally the world to stand up for democracy and against Russian aggression.” The speech, and all the pomp and circumstance that surrounds it, arrives as Biden’s approval rating falls to new lows, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. Just 37% said they approved of the job he was doing, with a majority of independents rating him negatively. Underscoring the headwinds facing Democrats ahead of the midterm elections, 50% of Americans said they wanted Republicans in charge of Congress. Just 40% preferred Democrats to remain in control. In a preview of the speech, White House officials said Biden would tout his administration’s progress on the pandemic, the economic recovery and a pair of early legislative successes: a $1.9tn stimulus package and the bipartisan infrastructure law. They said Biden would acknowledge the financial hardships facing many American families, while attempting to shift the narrative around the country’s economic trajectory from one of pessimism to progress. Pointing to low unemployment and job growth, Biden will credit his economic policies with helping to usher in a rapid recovery, while calling for Congress to enact new measures designed to lower the costs of child care, healthcare and prescription drugs. The ideas represent some of the most popular parts of Biden’s sweeping domestic policy bill, known as Build Back Better, that is languishing before the Senate. “The president is proud of the administration’s progress to date,” a senior administration official told reporters in a preview of his remarks. “We all look forward to building on this progress by easing price pressures and extending the historic labor market recovery in the months ahead.” He is expected to directly address rising inflation, which is increasingly a top priority for voters and one of Republicans’ most potent attacks on Democrats. Biden will also take the opportunity to tout his nominee for the supreme court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. If confirmed by the evenly-divided Senate, she will be the first Black woman on the court, fulfilling a pledge Biden made during the most difficult days of his campaign for the Democratic nomination. Security is always high during the State of the Union, which brings political leaders under one roof. Capitol police have installed an “inner-perimeter fence”, evoking the tense days following the January 6 assault. For a three-hour window, flights will be restricted around Washington. The Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, was chosen to deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden, an opportunity often awarded to a rising star. The first woman to govern Iowa, Reynolds gained national attention for bucking Covid-19 policies championed by Biden. The Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, will also offer a response on behalf of the progressive Working Families Party. She is expected to call on Democrats to restart negotiations over Biden’s domestic spending bill, which includes poverty-reducing, economic and climate policies that are a priority for many progressives. All 535 members of Congress were invited to attend the speech and will be seated on the floor and in the gallery. Guests are not allowed and full vaccination is “strongly recommended” but not required. Ahead of the speech, the Congress physician announced that masks were now optional in the Capitol, including in the House chamber during the State of the Union. The decision will help underscore the message Biden hopes to deliver: that the US is moving beyond the pandemic. The rule-change may also have averted a possible showdown with Republican lawmakers who have refused to comply with a mask mandate, incurring tens of thousands of dollars in fines. Still, the address comes as relations between parties have become increasingly toxic. And the crisis in Ukraine has done little to ease the seething partisanship at home. Republicans have hammered the president over his handling of the pandemic and the economy as well as his response to Ukraine, which some have argued as too little too late. Yet their criticism of Biden’s foreign policy leadership is complicated by the party’s embrace of Trump, who praised and flattered Putin even after Russia’s invasion.",News/US news,"Pandemic, war and a rocky economy loom large over Biden’s first state of the union",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/28/joe-biden-state-of-the-union-preview
3/1/2022,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has prompted responses from the cultural sphere, with Russian artists and companies beginning to feel the repercussions of decisions taken by the Kremlin. Not only has Russia been stripped of two prestigious events – the Champions League men’s final and Formula One’s Russian Grand Prix –but an increasing number of performances by Russians are being cancelled worldwide. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said Russia would no longer be allowed to participate in this year’s Eurovision song contest. EBU, the producers of Eurovision said the event promoted “international exchange and understanding,” adding that Russia’s inclusion could bring the annual competition into disrepute “in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine”. State broadcasters from countries including Iceland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands had called for Russia to be banned from the contest, which takes place in Turin in May. The UK culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, also endorsed the move. Eurovision stands for freedom, unity and respect between countries - watched and enjoyed by tens of millions around the world.Glad to see @Eurovision taking action and kicking Russia out. https://t.co/3YvH3aZQ0Q The Royal Opera House has cancelled a planned residency by Moscow’s Bolshoi Ballet, one of the oldest and most prestigious ballet companies in the world. “A summer season of the Bolshoi Ballet at the Royal Opera House had been in the final stages of planning,” the ROH said. “Unfortunately, under the current circumstances, the season cannot now go ahead.” The dance troupe was set to stage 21 performances from 26 July to 14 August. Performances by The Russian State Ballet of Siberia have also been cancelled by Wolverhampton Grand Theatre and the Royal and Derngate in Northampton. The local Ukrainian community had previously called for the cancellation. Given the situation in Ukraine, Royal & Derngate have taken the decision to cancel today’s performances of The Russian State Ballet. And the Helix theatre in Dublin cancelled a performance of Swan Lake by the Royal Moscow Ballet “to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine”. Concert appearances by Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, who had been scheduled to lead the Vienna Philharmonic at New York’s Carnegie Hall, have been cancelled. Russian pianist Denis Matsuev was also replaced. Both had publicly endorsed Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. A Carnegie Hall spokesperson attributed the decision to “Recent world events”. A pair of upcoming performances in May by Russia’s Mariinsky Orchestra, which were due to be led by Gergiev at Carnegie Hall, have also been cancelled. Meanwhile, Green Day have cancelled their upcoming stadium concert in Moscow. The Russian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale will not take place as planned this year after Russian artists and curators themselves pulled out. Artists Alexandra Sukhareva and Kirill Savchenkov, as well as curator Raimundas Malašauskas, said that they would no longer participate. “There is no place for art when civilians are dying under the fire of missiles, when citizens of Ukraine are hiding in shelters, when Russian protesters are getting silenced,” Savchenkov and Sukhareva said in a joint statement. The organisers of the pavilion said in an Instagram post that the pavilion would remain closed. The Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow said it would halt preparations for upcoming shows, while exhibitions at GES-2 House of Culture – including one by Ragnar Kjartansson – were also suspended. In the UK, the Victoria and Albert Museum has said it is in talks with the culture department about the “rapidly evolving situation”. The museum’s exhibition on Peter Carl Fabergé features many of his priceless eggs on loan from museums in Russia. The Ukrainian Film Academy has called for an international boycott of Russian cinema, including a ban on Russian films at international festivals. In an online petition, the organisation said: “At a time when world powers are imposing economic and political sanctions on the Russian Federation, the country continues to be active in the cultural field”. Any action, however, is yet to be taken.",News/World news,The show can’t go on: Russian arts cancelled worldwide ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/the-show-cant-go-on-russian-arts-cancelled-worldwide
3/1/2022,"Abdul Khan has a dream. He wants to own a farm, or maybe a zoo. He will keep rabbits, sheep, cows, dogs, cats, horses and pigeons. There will be a guesthouse that he can rent out to tourists. He doesn’t mind where the farm is – in the UK or back home in Pakistan – as long as there is room for his animals. “I love all the animals,” he says. “Farming is a dream life. I would love it.” For now, Khan (not his real name) works in London as a courier for a delivery app. Khan, who is in his early 30s, didn’t expect to end up couriering. His plan was always to set up a business. He is a natural entrepreneur. When he was at school in Pakistan, he bought sandwiches and sold them for profit at a market. When he was studying business management, he sold sim cards at a train station. He was good at it – and it is not hard to see why. Khan is charming and charismatic, the sort of person who – as his mother-in-law always tells him – could sell sand to Arabs and ice to Inuit. By 2019, after working in retail for nearly a decade, Khan had saved enough money to buy a hot food van. He planned to sell Pakistani street food at markets in London and burgers and chips on sunny days at beaches on the south coast. He bought all the equipment and did work experience with friends who owned street food vans. He did test runs. A south coast resort on a rainy day was a bust – he made only £20 – but when it was sunny he made £2,000 in four hours. He would have made even more money, but he ran out of food. By the end of the year, the business seemed viable. Khan had applied for all the permits and identified where he wanted to trade. He had saved enough money to live on until it was profitable. He went on holiday, to visit family, and returned in February 2020, ready to knuckle down. Then Covid hit. Khan spent all his savings on rent and living costs. He was ineligible for government assistance, as he hadn’t been trading long enough, and for months he was unable to take the van out to earn money. “The pandemic killed me,” he says. So, out of necessity, Khan works as a courier. He has six people to support. His wife has health problems and has to look after their two young children, so can’t work. His parents in Pakistan are elderly and frail. Khan sends them money every month. He is an only child, so there is no one to share the load. “I hate running the kitchen,” says Khan, using a Pakistani colloquialism that means paying your household expenses. “I can do much better. But I have to provide.” A pot of chewing gum rattles around in the cup holder of his hybrid car; Khan often skips lunch to keep working, so he chews gum to stave off hunger pangs. He has two phones: one plugged to his dashboard, which he uses as a satnav, and one that he uses to select jobs via the company’s app and liaise with customers. The second phone pings constantly with notifications that are like sound effects on a video game. Every morning, Khan logs into the app. It has a bulletin board listing all the available jobs for that day. Khan scans the app, looking to cluster similar postcodes and create an efficient and maximally profitable route. The key is to find the biting point between postcodes and job value. On a good day, Khan will collect a bunch of packages from N5, say, and drop off all of them in SW9, say, and all of these jobs will be high-value, at £15 or £20 each. (It is rare for an inner-London rate to be higher than £25 a delivery. “That is very much a glorious job,” says Khan.) It is more complicated than it sounds. For starters, Khan needs to make sure all the packages will fit in his car. He picks up all sorts of things routinely: supermarket shopping, restaurant equipment, medical equipment, electronics, children’s toys, single packs of cigarettes. He needs to be sure that he will be able to collect and drop off the items within the set timeframe, with minimal waiting. He needs to consider whether the order value is worth incurring central London’s congestion charge. He needs to assess whether the rate being offered reflects his fuel costs and the amount of time he may spend in traffic. “Time and effort and fuel and price,” says Khan. “You take everything into consideration and weigh up the job. Is it worth it?” Khan has only seconds to decide before another driver selects his preferred job from the board. It is a hasty calculus, with financially devastating consequences if he gets it wrong. Early November. Work is slow. Khan starts at 9am and finishes at 6pm. In that time, he says he makes £103, which sounds acceptable, until you subtract the congestion charge (£15) and the cost of Khan’s fuel (£25). If his figures are correct, he seems to have made just £7 an hour, which is well below the legal minimum wage of £8.91 an hour. In fact, it works out at even less than £7 an hour, because of all his other costs. Khan owns his car, but he has to pay for insurance (£2,300 a year, paid in monthly instalments) and services (£210, payable each six months), plus new brake pads (£315 a year) and tyres (£320 a year). This is despite the fact that the platform for which Khan drives has pledged to pay all its drivers the living wage. Khan says, when his costs are accounted for, it can be hard to make the minimum wage. “It is hard for me to pay my rent and put food on the table right now for my family,” he says. Fuel prices have been increasing all year, which is hurting self‑employed drivers such as Khan. “It’s really difficult when they’re not increasing your pay,” he says. “Petrol has gone up too much.” He used to pay £1.14 a litre. Now, it is closer to £1.45 – an increase of 27%. In January, UK inflation hit a 10-year high. Food prices are soaring. Khan tries not to think about the mounting cost-of-living crisis and how bad things might get. “I need to put myself into what I want to achieve,” says Khan. To stay afloat, Khan works between 50 and 60 hours a week. Khan is classified as a self-employed independent contractor, meaning that he has no employment rights, is not entitled to the legal minimum wage and does not receive sick pay, a pension or annual leave. Instead, he is paid only for each drop. There is no compensation for his travel time to collect the parcel, his waiting time (unless the client exceeds the prescribed collection window) or the time he spends stuck in traffic or lost. In the view of Alex Marshall of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents gig-economy workers, “these apps bogusly classify workers as independent contractors”. A true independent contractor, Marshall says, is “someone who comes around and offers a quote for a job, like a plumber, and decides if and when they want to work”. Marshall says someone such as Khan, who is reliant on the app for his income and is powerless to negotiate his salary, should be classified as a worker and be eligible for annual leave, the minimum wage and other benefits. But the apps exploit loopholes in legislation. “There is minimal employment regulation enforcement in this country,” says Marshall. In March last year, the UK supreme court dismissed an appeal by Uber against a landmark employment tribunal ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers. At the time, it was hailed as a breakthrough that could put pressure on other gig-economy firms to change tack, but many say little has changed in practice. Delivery is not, historically, an industry with large profit margins. “The only way it can be profitable is if you underpay the person who is the courier, by not treating them as an employee, by not paying taxes, by not paying their insurance, by refusing to give them sick pay or cover them if they have an accident or train them,” says Prof Annabelle Gawer, the director of the Centre of Digital Economy at the University of Surrey. “That is where the ‘savings’ are coming from.” By the first week of December, Khan’s financial situation is dire. He had to return to Pakistan for family reasons. His cousin wanted to marry a woman from a different community and it was causing problems. Khan smoothed things out; they got married. Only Khan could have done it. “You know that one character in your family who controls everyone?” he says, laughing. “That’s me. People listen. I said to them: ‘Come on now! We’re living in the 21st century.’” Normally, Khan would pay for flights back to Pakistan in instalments, but because the situation was urgent he had to front the cost, £470, in full. Luckily, work is busy. Khan leaves home at 9am, then picks up and drops off 11 parcels. “I was everywhere,” he says. Horley in Surrey, Wembley in north-west London, Greenwich in the south-east of the city. Because he is so busy, he eats lunch late, at around 4pm – a wrap from a chicken shop. “If you stop for half an hour to take a break, it delays everything,” he says. “You are losing money.” Khan has always been a grafter. When he worked in retail, he would sometimes come in on his day off, for free. He learned how to cash up – counting and recording the money taken from the till – even though this was above his pay grade. He progressed from shelf stacker to team leader to deputy manager to store manager. “I love to learn things,” he says. “This is why I got progress.” With his experience, he could easily go back to the shop floor, but because some of his family have medical conditions Khan wants the flexibility to take them to their hospital appointments. As he is driving, Khan listens to talk radio. James O’Brien on LBC is his favourite. He is not so sure about the station’s outspoken presenter Maajid Nawaz (who has since left). “Sometimes I love him and sometimes I hate him,” says Khan. He speaks to his mum and dad on the phone. After 12 years of living in the UK, his mum still asks him the same question every time Khan calls: what did he have for dinner last night? Khan considers ringing his newly married cousin, but he doesn’t want to disturb his conjugal bliss. After 200 miles and a 13-hour shift, Khan gets home at 10pm. He attends to his animals: dogs, a tank full of fish and a parrot. They get only the best: Royal Canin food for the dogs, which he supplements with fresh chicken, tuna and sardines; nuts for the parrot. The fish tank, meanwhile, needs to be heated to 30C. His wife has waited up for him, so they eat dinner together, which makes Khan happy, as he hates eating alone. Afterwards, he checks his app. He has made £250, although he believes it is closer to £130 after costs. In the second week of December, the pre-Christmas rush picks up. It is the busiest time of the year for couriers. At 9am, he picks up a job heading into central London – a smart move, because he knows he will be able to pick up other jobs while he is there. At 7pm, he is almost ready to come home when he sees a job going – to Brighton – for £60. Khan is already heading that way, as he has a drop off in Crawley, West Sussex. By the time he gets home, it is 12.30am. For his fifteen and a half hour day, he earns £208. “These companies operate in ways that are hyperexploitative,” says Marshall. “People aren’t making the minimum wage and they’re running around like headless chickens.” Khan’s wife has waited up for him, as usual. They eat dinner and she goes to bed, but Khan stays awake, going through the paperwork on his outstanding parking tickets. He has three fines, totalling £600. “The tickets are really, really stressful,” he says. Urban planning is not designed for car couriers. “If anyone can be a courier, that means that, theoretically, any number of cars can be on the road at any time,” says Dr Oliver Bates of Lancaster University. “Are these platforms talking with city planners about the need for drop-off and collection points? Or are we just building new blocks of flats in areas with double-yellow lines all over the place? Because these are the people who, through the pandemic, risked their health to bring us food and consumer goods. I wonder whether cities take account of that.” Khan always appeals his tickets, but two of his appeals have been rejected, so he has no choice but to pay them: £260. Christmas week. Khan is working furiously, partly to pay for the parking tickets, but also because he knows his work will dry up in the post-Christmas slump. “It’s always less busy in January,” he says. “People spend so much money on Christmas and new year.” Cab drivers also log on to courier apps to pick up some jobs, meaning there are more drivers than work to go around. Khan picks up a job, collecting from a restaurant in east London and going to south-west London, for £20. It has been booked into the system as a 5kg job, but when Khan arrives he sees that it is actually a large number of much heavier items. He refuses the job. “I’m not having it,” he says. “It’s not right. It’s not worth it.” Khan should receive a small cancellation fee, because the order was incorrectly booked on the system. But to try to weasel out of paying it, someone has claimed that Khan was rude and chose not to take the job. After arguing about it all day, Khan eventually gets paid the cancellation fee. The decision went his way, this time, but, as an independent contractor, Khan has no rights. He can’t make the app pay him a cancellation fee and he can’t query or negotiate the rates it offers. The only power Khan has is to accept or reject jobs that are offered to him, which, when times are lean, isn’t much power at all. “How many other jobs do you have where your rate of pay is changing in front of your eyes and there’s no minimum standard, or transparency about how you get paid and how they calculate it?” says Marshall. “You take what you’re given and it’s yes or no. They think the freedom is that you can say yes or no. Like it or lump it. But that’s not freedom. These apps prey on people’s desperation.” Work is slow the week after Christmas. Khan takes a job he would ordinarily avoid: picking up groceries from a supermarket and dropping them at someone’s house. For this, the app will pay him £10. He arrives at the shop and contemplates the order. There are 14 crates of shopping to be delivered to a third‑floor flat. Khan isn’t allowed to take the crates with him, only the plastic bags. He calculates that it will take him an hour and a half to load the bags into his car, drive to the block of flats and carry up the bags. “It’s too much,” he says. “It’s not worth it for £10. I’m not doing it for that.” He rejects the order at the supermarket, meaning that he travelled there for nothing. Khan is used to delivering groceries: before he began working for his current app in November 2021, he drove for another delivery company, which included delivering for a major supermarket. Khan earned more money then: the company had a minimum income guarantee and he sometimes earned £15 an hour. He worked hard for it, delivering groceries throughout the pandemic, sometimes even sleeping in his car at night because he finished work late and had a shift in the morning. He wanted to keep driving for the company, but the work dried up. Khan tries to help fellow drivers. He has been involved in helping drivers come together to lobby their bosses for better pay. Gig-economy workers are often migrant workers of colour. “Most don’t speak English as a first language,” says Marshall. “They are indoctrinated to believe they are lucky to have any job at all in a society that constantly says they are unskilled workers.” When Khan was at school, he helped organise pupils in a campaign to get air conditioning in classrooms. The staff room had air conditioning: it wasn’t fair. After a year and a half of organising, which included direct action – the boys unplugged the teachers’ air conditioning unit – they were victorious. “I don’t know why I’m like this,” says Khan. “I can’t handle something being wrong.” Afew days later, Khan is at one of his regular pickup spots, a warehouse in south-west London. He is friendly with the client and they get to griping about the cost of living. Fuel prices keep increasing. Khan is now paying £1.55 a litre. The client tells him that the app has put its rates up. Khan is incensed, because his pay has not gone up. “The company increases the cost to the customer, but they are not paying us proper money,” he says. A few days before new year, Khan leaves home at 9.15am and drives to his first booking, a bijou party store in south London. He has been booked to collect two packages of inflated balloons and drop them at two separate addresses in north London, for £23. He arrives at 9.55am. The package can be collected at any time from 10am. His phone goes. The client tells him that he can’t collect until 10.20am. Khan remonstrates with her, pointing out that she booked the delivery for 10am. “I don’t have it ready,” she responds. In the end, the balloons aren’t ready until 10.40am, at which point he drives away with them bobbing on the backseat. As customers go, Khan is used to worse. “Sometimes they are really rude,” he says. When he gets lost and asks for directions, they’re dismissive and won’t help. “They say: ‘I don’t know! This is your job. You should find it.’” If Khan asks them to come out to collect a parcel, because there is nowhere for him to park without getting a ticket, they refuse. “They say: ‘It’s not my problem. You shouldn’t have taken this job.’” Previously, the disrespect would grind Khan down. “It used to annoy me too much, but now I’m used to it,” he says. “What can you do? Argue with them? Then they give you a bad rating and you’re not going to get more jobs.” The rest of the day is quiet. He drops off the last of the balloons at a multimillion-pound townhouse. He carries a laptop to the seventh floor of a building and returns to his car, out-of-breath and worried that he will have been given a parking ticket. (He hasn’t.) He collects boxes of food that makes his car smell of tomato and garlic from a catering business. He drops off his final package in central London just after 3pm and hangs around for a bit, to see if there are any other jobs. There aren’t, so he goes home. He calculates he has earned £75 before expenses. It is not enough. “Now, if I don’t work, I have no money for next week. How am I going to pay my bills?” he says. “I’ve never been in this position before.” He says this matter-of-factly, without a shred of self-pity. He makes just £306 all week, before expenses. The first week of January, things are dead. “Not too much work nowadays,” Khan says. “Not good. Struggling time.” He earns £252 in a week, before expenses. “It’s nothing,” he says. “Not even paying my bills.” Khan has one good day during the second week of January. He makes £152, driving from Lewisham in south London to Wembley, then central London, Wimbledon in south-west London and Horsham, West Sussex. But it is a one-off; the other days are slow. To save on having to heat his car, Khan stays at home, constantly checking to see if anything half‑decent has come in. There are plenty of supermarket pickup jobs, but it is not worth it for £6. “The whole job will take one hour, and I’m not even making £6 an hour, after car costs,” he says. “Will be more like £2 to £3. What’s the point?” Khan and his wife have decided it is best that he sells some of his animals. The parrot, the fish and one of the dogs. He can’t afford to keep them. Heating the fish tank adds to the electricity bill. Each dog eats half a kilo of food a day. The parrot needs nuts to snack on and toys for stimulation. “Obviously, it’s not nice,” he says, his voice totally flat. “But if I can’t afford it, what can I do? They deserve a better life. I need to provide for my children.” Letting one of his beloved dogs go will be unbearable. “It’s hard,” he says, after a big pause. “It’s hard. Really sad.” He wonders if there is any other work he can do until things pick up. Gardening? Odd jobs? He is endeavouring, as always, to maintain a serene outlook. “By stressing out, you won’t get jobs,” he says. “There’s nothing to be stressed about. Stress won’t solve the problem.” For now, he sits at home, waits, refreshes the app. He worries about how he will pay his rent and bills, send money to his parents, save enough to get his catering business going again, make it profitable enough to buy his farm. Of his dream, he says: “Let’s see if it ever comes.”",News/Society,"The hidden life of a courier: 13-hour days, rude customers – and big dreams",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/01/the-hidden-life-of-a-courier-13-hour-days-rude-customers-and-big-dreams
3/1/2022,"Millions of people are flocking to platforms such as Facebook, TikTok and Twitter for round-the-clock updates the Russian invasion of Ukraine – renewing scrutiny of the outsized role that tech companies play in disseminating news of war. Social media has long been instrumental in distributing frontline footage, but Ukraine presents a new scale of global conflict for private platforms to navigate. Tech companies are facing a constant stream of mis- and disinformation, propaganda from Russian-backed outlets, violent content, and on-the-ground footage of fleeing refugees, causing world leaders and tech watchdogs to call for greater accountability and transparency in how companies wield their powerful platforms. Ukrainian officials last week pleaded with US tech giants to take action against Russia, urging them to restrict access to their services within Russia, more forcefully curtail the spread of misinformation, and crack down on Russian state-backed outlets. “In 2022, modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple rocket launchers and missiles,” Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, said in a letter to Tim Cook asking the Apple CEO to cut off Russia’s access to the App Store. Over the weekend, the prime ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia sent a joint letter to the chief executives of Google, Facebook, and Twitter, urging them to proactively suspend accounts denying, glorifying or justifying wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. “Although the online platforms have undertaken significant efforts to address the Russian government’s unprecedented assault on truth, they have not done enough,” they said in the letter. They also urged the companies to suspend the official accounts of Russian and Belarusian government institutions, state-controlled media and personal accounts of the countries’ leadership and their associates that routinely disseminate false information about the invasion. Some platforms have taken heed. Twitter said that on 27 February it had permanently suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked some content that violated its “manipulation and spam” policy. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, spoke with EU officials on Sunday to discuss how to better crack down on misinformation. Meta, which owns Facebook, has barred Russian state-run media from selling ads on its platforms and removed networks of accounts spreading misinformation. Its vice-president Nick Clegg tweeted on Monday it had restricted access to the Kremlin-backed media outlets RT and Sputnik across the EU, following requests from a number of governments and the EU. Clegg also said Meta would continue to label and factcheck these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetize their accounts globally. But some argue this is not enough. Although Facebook said in October 2019 it would start “labelling state-controlled media on their Page and in our Ad Library”, as part of efforts against disinformation targeting US elections, a study released on Friday by the Center for Countering Digital Hate showed Facebook was failing to label 91% of posts containing Russian propaganda about Ukraine. “Facebook has once again fallen short on their promises to enforce their own rules,” said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. “The justification for the Russian war against Ukraine was built on Facebook.” An activist group monitoring Facebook policy that calls itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board called on the platform to take “more aggressive action” to stop the spread of misinformation. The group has called on Meta cut off Russian state-funded media entirely and proactively suspend accounts justifying wars of aggression. It also requested more information about how many resources Facebook was dedicating to content moderation in Russia and Ukraine, including in local languages. Others have called for more direct government intervention in how tech companies handle Russia. The Biden administration should issue clear sanctions preventing American digital media firms from – at the very least – doing business with and monetizing Russian state accounts, said Justin Hendrix, the CEO and editor of the non-profit democracy and technology media venture Tech Policy press. “This is war, and the lies and falsehoods that the Russian state media and Putin’s officials will share in the next days across American social media platforms are weapons intended to legitimize the Kremlin’s brutality, divide Ukraine’s allies and diminish any potential opposition,” he said.

3/1/2022,"Paulette Hamilton can barelyleave her campaign headquarters onErdington high street without being approached for a chat. “I want Boris Johnson out. I don’t like him,” young mum Sabrina Simmonds tells her. Another supporter, Dave, takes a poster to display in his window, while a third wants to complain about the dilapidated state of the street. Hamilton, who has lived nearby for 35 years, agrees: “You can always tell when an area’s going down, when it starts to get filled – not with the big name shops, but with your pawnbrokers, your bookies, your gambling slot machines. A former nurse, mother of five and local councillor, Hamilton is Labour’s candidate in Thursday’s byelection, which was triggered by the sudden death of the area’s longstanding MP Jack Dromeyin January. Labour held this seat in 2019 with a slim majority of 3,601, and party insiders say they expect it to be high on the Tories’ attack list for the next general election. Yet less than a year on from the humiliating loss of the Hartlepool byelection, which raised the prospect of the Conservatives continuing to make advances into Labour territory, Keir Starmer’s party is confident of holding on here. Starmer has visited several times, as have much of the party’s frontbench, including the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, and shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. “When Sir Keir Starmer came and walked down the high street, that was phenomenal – people couldn’t believe he was here,” Hamilton says. Labour is buoyed by the shift in the polls since Partygate began to damage the Tories’ popularity, and in particular by signs that voters are starting to trust them more on the economy. A recent Ipsos poll showed Labour still six points behindon the question of which party should be trusted to grow Britain’s economy, but 17 points ahead when it came to tackling the rising cost of living. Hamilton says that’s the first thing most voters want to raise. “The uplift with the electric, gas, with the inflation rate, with the 1.25 percentage point national insurance increase – that has been one of the massive issues in this area, and it’s bubbling,” she says In Erdington, Labour has a clear policy offer: a cut in VAT on fuel bills, plus means-tested help for the poorest households funded by a windfall tax on the energy giants. Hamilton says she has been able to contrast that with Rishi Sunak’s promise of a £200 loan, to be paid back from future energy bills, plus a council tax rebate. The proportion of people claiming unemployment benefits in Birmingham Erdington is twice the national average, and 31% of children are growing up in poverty against 19% for the UK as a whole. Hamilton says voluntary groups are stepping in. “Even though people say it’s a poor area, the community spirit and what people are doingis absolutely phenomenal,” she says. Gerard Goshawkfrom Erdington food bank saysit has handed out more than 13,000 parcels of provisions, many to families with children, in the current financial year, even before much of the energy price rise has taken hold – and with worse to come in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “It’s shocking. We have got busier in the pandemic and we’re busier now because of the concerns – well, the reality – of the impact of the cost of living. And just the impact of the universal credit system. People that are in debt to the government, or that have been sanctioned for all sorts of reasons,” he explains. While the prime minister’s lockdown-busting antics aren’t high on voters’ list of concerns, Hamilton says they do come up. “People who voted Conservative in 2019 are embarrassed, because what he’s done is literally said one thing and done another, and people feel as if he’s broken their trust.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jon Ashworth, who visited Erdington to campaign last Wednesday, says he feels the state of the economy and Johnson’s character have become closely entwined. “They don’t trust him, they don’t believe him – they don’t think he’s got the abilities to grip the real issues facing the country. It all reinforces a sense that he’s not up to it,” he says, adding, “I think it’s quite a significant time, politically.” Since Ashworth’s visit, the headlines have been filled with Russia’s devastating invasion of Ukraine. Robert Hayward, the Conservative peer and pollster, says such events tend to benefit the incumbent government electorally: “There’s no question that foreign affairs will have an impact, but it will be a small impact in my view.” He says it has also helped Starmer’s party that they have been able to turn the conversation from Covid – or before that, Brexit – on to “bread and butter issues, where the Labour party is getting getting traction”. It is unclear whether that opportunity will now be curtailed by events in Ukraine. Alison Farrell, behind the counter in Farrell’s Caribbean grocers on Erdington high street, votes Conservative but has no sympathy for Johnson. “It would have been much easier if he’d just told the truth in the first place. Honesty is the best policy,” she says. “All this he’s doing to make people go back to liking him – it doesn’t work like that.” She does “think he needs to go,” she says – but in a warning of how much work remains for Starmer’s party, adds, “not to say, put in Labour.”",News/Politics,‘People who voted Tory are embarrassed’: Labour in buoyant mood before Birmingham Erdington byelection,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/01/birmingham-erdington-byelection-voters-labour-paulette-hamilton
3/1/2022,"Climate scientists from around the world issued dire warnings on Monday, in the latest IPCC report on the dangers posed in the unfolding climate crisis. Among them is extreme heat, a crisis that on average already claims more American lives than hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Though the impact is already being felt, heatwaves are largely silent killers. Often, the toll is tallied far into the aftermath of an event and is vastly undercounted. Unlike fires and floods that produce immediate and visible destruction, heat’s harmful effects can seem more subtle – even if they are in fact more deadly. “People don’t think of heat as a hazard,” says Kristie Ebi, a professor in the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington. But in the Pacific north-west, where Ebi lives, for example, unprecedented temperatures baked the region last year, bewildering residents used to moderate, often lukewarm, summers. Policymakers and environmentalists are looking for better ways to close the gap in the public’s perception of the risks, especially in the American west where landscapes are rapidly warming. Some are pushing for new ranking systems to help elevate awareness around the issue or assign heatwaves names, much like federal agencies do for hurricanes. “We need a shock to the system,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, the senior vice-president and director of the Adrienne Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center. The organization, which focuses on policy solutions to the climate crisis, has advocated heatwave naming along with number categories as a way to add urgency to the growing disasters. “If you go into the hospital now and are suffering from heat they will say you have kidney failure or heart failure” she says. “There are so many areas now we need to culturally shift that context of heat.” The group advised California on new legislation introduced last year, which would make it the first state to implement a naming and ranking system like the organizational system for categorizing storms dating back in the 1800s. Athens, Greece and Seville, Spain will roll out similar programs later this year. Advocates of the program believe assigning a name to a disaster will help people engage with it. “It becomes an identity and a brand is built,” Baughman McLeod said, adding that it also helps for archival purposes. “We all remember what happened during Hurricane Sandy. I know what a Category 3 is and I know when it has a name it has reached a certain threshold and I need to pay attention and act.” Still, the science isn’t clear on whether a name would do much to communicate heightened dangers in the most effective way. “The National Weather Service is not aware of any research or evidence that suggests naming heatwaves would raise awareness about heat-related risks” said Kimberly McMahon, a NWS Public Weather Services program manager. But early warning systems, with or without associated names play an important part, she said. “Even knowing the potential for a heat event or abnormally hot summer can allow preparations to occur further in advance.” Naming, too, can have its problems. A study published in 2014 found that Americans don’t adequately assess the risks when hurricanes are given female names. More than just a hallmark of misogyny, the researchers found this actually cost lives. On average deaths were more than 95% higher during female-named hurricanes than those assigned male names. Naming aside, the two bills in California also outline the creation of an interagency heat taskforce, an extreme heat advisory council, and will open a new chief heat officer role to oversee planning and preparation. The pieces of legislation, if they pass, would initiate statewide advance warning and ranking by the start of 2024 and would establish the Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program to coordinate state efforts and coordinate with local and regional officials. Ebi says that coordination between agencies – that include local, state, and federal programs – will be key. “There are lots of opportunities to facilitate the information transfer so that as people develop these systems they don’t start from the very beginning” she said, noting that a variety of stakeholders should be brought to the table. “On the one hand the projections are dire,” Ebi says. “But on the other, we have an enormous basket of options for what can be done to protect people who are at higher risk during a heatwave.” Several municipalities across the west and governments across the globe are already adopting heat programs and plans. At the federal level, The National Integrated Heat Health Information Systems and White House Extreme Heat Interagency Working Group are collaborating to expand messaging about extreme heat and offering up lessons learned. Phoenix, which is at the top of the list of rapidly heating cities, hired scientist and heat expert David Hondula to head its new Office of Heat Response and Mitigation in September last year, becoming the first city to launch a publicly-funded position of this kind. Miami, Florida also brought on a chief heat officer, as did Athens, Greece and Freetown in Sierra Leone. There’s still a difficult path ahead, but according to Ebi, planning will go a long way. “All heat-related deaths are preventable,” she said. “We have a real opportunity to improve lives today even if the climate continues to change.”",News/Environment,California debates naming heatwaves to underscore deadly risk of extreme heat,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/california-heatwaves-naming-system-climate-crisis
3/1/2022,"A Russian convoy of armoured vehicles, tanks and other military equipment about 40 miles long (64km) was approaching Kyiv on Tuesday, satellite images suggested, as lawmakers in Washington voiced fears of a “long and bloody” fight ahead. US senators sounded the warning after receiving classified briefings on Monday night that brought to life the spectre of a protracted battle over the capital and “street to street combat” in Kyiv against Russian forces who have been frustrated by a fierce resistance and their own logistical failures. The Russian armoured convoy was 17 miles (25km) from the centre of the Ukrainian capital, a city normally home to three million, according to the US satellite company Maxar. Its photos also showed deployments of ground forces and ground attack helicopter units in southern Belarus, amid concerns its president, Alexander Lukashenko, could send troops to help Vladimir Putin’s Russian forces in the next 24 hours. In the US, the Democratic senator Chris Murphy said intelligence suggested Russia would try to cut off Kyiv in the coming weeks. “The fight for Kyiv will be long and bloody and Ukrainians are rapidly preparing for street to street combat.” The Republican Senator Marco Rubio said: “What I think is pretty certain is Russia is off their timeline. I think they thought that within 72 hours they’d hold Kyiv.” The warning came as it was reported that more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv. The region’s head, Dmytro Zhyvytskyy, posted photographs on Telegram of the charred shell of a four-storey building and rescuers searching rubble. According to some reports shelling or missiles hit a building being used as a base by the Ukrainian military as well as fuel tanks with one local official claiming fuel air explosive had been used although that could not be independently confirmed. Video from the time of the attack showed a column of thick black smoke above the town. In a later Facebook post, Zhyvytskyy said many Russian soldiers and some local residents died in the bombardment on Monday. Okhtyrka Mayor Pavlo Kuzmenko posted on Facebook, saying: “Again, the enemy is waging a vile war. A fuel-air bomb was dropped on an oil depot, oil tanks were blown up.” There were also reports that Russian soldiers had entered the city of Kherson. The developments came after reports in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city, of widespread use of indiscriminate weapons such as multiple rocket launchers against civilian areas on Monday, suggesting that the Kremlin, having failed to land a knockout blow in the first days of the war, was prepared to unleash more desperate methods. In response, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of committing war crimes by attacking a “peaceful city” with no military facilities. “The Russians knew where they were shooting,” he said in a video address. At least nine people were killed and 37 injured in rocket strikes on the eastern city in what appeared to be a shift towards bombing civilian areas. The mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said the death toll included three children. “Today we had a very difficult day. It showed us that it’s not just a war, this is a massacre of Ukrainian people,” Terekhov said. The prosecutor of the international criminal court said he would launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine. In other developments: British prime minister Boris Johnson is due to fly to visit countries on Nato’s border with Russia on Tuesday, pledging that Vladimir Putin will “feel the consequences” for invading Ukraine. China, something of an uneasy ally of Putin, has started evacuating citizens from Ukraine. The first group, students, left for Moldova on Monday, Chinese state media reported. Ukraine relaxed visa rules to allow in foreign volunteers willing to help repel Russian forces. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UN said Russia had used a thermobaric weapon during the invasion. Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations near the Belarus-Ukraine border ended inconclusively, with national news agencies quoting officials as saying the negotiators would return to their respective capitals for consultations before embarking on a second round of talks in the coming days. Zelenskiy on Monday signed an official request for Ukraine to join the EU. The bloc said it was expecting Ukraine’s application “imminently” and it “would need to be assessed very rapidly by the council, and a decision made as to whether to request an urgent opinion from the commission”. On Monday, the UN general assembly began an emergency session to address the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s allies are hoping to get the support of more than 100 countries to support a resolution condemning Russia, in an attempt to press home Moscow’s isolation. While the assembly was under way, the US mission to the UN announced it was expelling 12 Russian diplomats for allegedly engaging in espionage activities that threatened national security. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzya, said the diplomats had been told to leave by 7 March. He called it another “hostile” measure against the Russian mission. Ukraine’s UN ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, hailed the end on Monday night of Russia’s month-long rotating presidency of the UN security council, saying: “I’m looking forward to midnight when this abomination – occupation of the seat of the president of the security council by Russia – will be over.” Americans and Canadians have been answering Zelenskiy’s call for the formation of an “international legion” of foreign fighters. Visa rules have been relaxed from Tuesday to allow in those willing to help repel Russian forces. “I feel guilty to not go,” said Dax, 26, an Alabama veteran of the US army 82nd Airborne infantry division, who planned to deploy with other former US military personnel.",News/World news,Fears of ‘bloody’ fight for Kyiv as huge Russian army convoy gathers on outskirts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/fears-of-bloody-fight-for-kyiv-as-huge-russian-army-convoy-gathers-on-outskirts
3/1/2022,"Scott Morrison has called for Russia to be treated as a “pariah state” over the invasion of Ukraine, as Australia committed $70m to provide Ukraine with missiles and ammunition. The Australian prime minister said on Tuesday that Russia should be diplomatically isolated and its membership of the G20 reconsidered, declaring “no one should have anything to do with them”. With satellite images showing a Russian military convoy stretching for about 64km in an area north-west of Kyiv, Morrison also warned Australians against travelling to Ukraine to fight on either side of the war, describing it as a legally ambiguous “suicide mission”. For days the Australian government has been signalling its willingness to fund the provision of lethal military equipment to Ukraine, but the details have been subject to talks with Nato partners. After a meeting of cabinet’s national security committee in Canberra on Tuesday, Morrison said the government was committing $70m towards “both lethal and nonlethal defensive support for Ukraine”. The majority of that funding was for lethal support. “We’re talking missiles, we’re talking ammunition, we’re talking supporting them in their defence of their own homeland in Ukraine and we will be doing that in partnership with Nato,” Morrison said. But the prime minister did not provide details about what specific equipment was being provided or how it would be delivered, saying he did not want to “give the Russian government a heads-up about what’s coming their way”. “Those anti-armour missiles are proving to be extraordinarily effective, so that is obviously a huge priority about where we will be directing particularly a lot of that initial investment.” The announcement follows a warning from Russia’s foreign ministry on Monday that countries supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine would “bear responsibility” if they were used against Russian troops. Asked whether the provision of lethal aid may make Australia a target for retaliation such as cyber-attacks, Morrison said it was in Australia’s interests to “stand up to bullies”. He said the world was dividing between autocratic, authoritarian regimes and liberal democracies, and Australia could not be “absent” in standing up for its principles. No state-sponsored cyber activity against Australia had been detected to date, but individuals and businesses should remain ready, Morrison added. Morrison said Australia wanted to “impose the most significant costs on Russia that we possibly can” as “a clear warning to anyone else who would seek to engage in such unlawful acts of aggression and violence through an invasion of that nature”. The Russian central bank increased interest rates to 20% from 9.5% after the rouble plunged up to 40% on Monday following sanctions from the US, the UK, Europe and others, which are likely to continue to expand. Morrison said Australia was in talks with Indonesia – the host of this year’s G20 – about excluding Russia, although Morrison acknowledged it was a sensitive matter. “I think there has been a very clear view expressed particularly by countries like Australia [and] G7 countries that this will need to be managed,” he said. “They [Russia] have self-selected themselves as a pariah state, and that’s how they should be known all around the world, and no one should have anything to do with them, frankly, right around the world.” Morrison said he believed Vladimir Putin had underestimated the strength of the international reaction to last week’s invasion of Ukraine, but predicted this would lead “to an even more violent response from Russia”. The prime minister repeated his warnings against travelling to join the new legion for international volunteers that Ukraine’s government is assembling, saying the command structure was “totally unknown” so it was unclear whether it would be legal for Australians to join it. Under the Criminal Code, it is an offence for an Australian to enter a foreign country to engage in hostile activity, unless “with the armed forces of the government of a foreign country”. Morrison did not answer a specific question about whether the government was considering using separate powers to declare no-go zones in parts of Ukraine, in order to also prevent people from travelling to join Russia’s armed forces. He said anyone travelling to Ukraine would “find themselves on the wrong end of some very, very violent attacks”, and added: “Others have described those sorts of things as suicide missions and that’s not an unreasonable assessment.” The defence minister, Peter Dutton, said the situation was “going to become more and more difficult” as Russian forces approached Kyiv. Many people would die “unless President Putin changes the course he is on at the moment”, Dutton said. On Tuesday the Russian embassy in Canberra argued the US and its European allies were responsible for the current crisis by backing the enlargement of Nato. On Facebook the Russian embassy reposted a 2014 article in the Foreign Affairs journal that suggested the US and Europe should “create a prosperous but neutral Ukraine” rather than “exacerbate hostilities with Russia”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian government has received bipartisan support for its response to Russia’s actions, with less than three months remaining before the federal election is due to be held. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said he was “dismayed by the scenes from Ukraine” as people were “fighting against this aggression from Russia, which is totally unwarranted, totally unprovoked”. “We support the strongest possible action by Australia, in partnership with the United States, with the United Kingdom, and with Nato, to make sure that we hold Vladimir Putin to account and that we express our solidarity with the people of Ukraine at this difficult time,” Albanese said on Tuesday. Albanese signalled he would support further action if taken, including expelling Russian diplomats, but said he was not looking for a political dispute over the government’s response. The Australian government is also offering an initial $35m to international organisations to support shelter, food and medical care, but said more assistance would be provided as humanitarian needs were better understood.",News/Australia news,‘Pariah state’: Australia gives $70m to Ukraine weapons fund and calls for diplomatic isolation of Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/pariah-state-australia-gives-70m-to-ukraine-weapons-fund-and-calls-for-diplomatic-isolation-of-russia
3/1/2022,"When the farm workers came down the hillside, burrowing under a barbed wire fence to bring boxes of water and bananas to the hundreds stranded by flood waters on the highway below, they were a little surprised to find everyone so well fed. And in such high spirits. Forget Lord of the Flies. This was a thriving community of shared resources and resourcefulness, where truck drivers dished out food that had been destined for supermarkets to waylaid holidaymakers who cooked it on camping stoves. Not everyone has been so lucky, however. Potentially thousands of vehicles are stranded on the M1, the main motorway between Sydney and Brisbane. Several hundred have been stuck between Ballina and Tweed Heads for at least 30 hours since the road was cut south of the Tweed River about 7.30am Monday. On Tuesday, more reports came through of drivers becoming stranded between Ballina and Coffs Harbour as the deluge tracks south. Those stuck further north had to work together to arrange their vehicles on to a series of “road islands” as flood waters rose around them in various pockets overnight. How people have fared depends on how well stocked the fellow travellers on their particular island have been. When the Guardian joined Duranbah farm workers bringing fruit and water down a steep, rain-sodden hillside beside the highway, we stumbled upon one of the lucky groups. For one thing, this group of 100 vehicles, stuck on a stretch of road about 800 metres long, had the benefit of a short road tunnel that had provided shelter from the pouring rain as well as some lighting after nightfall. They also had Rahjah McNae, who was driving a truck full of raw chicken bound for Aldi. By dinner time on Monday, the truck doors had been thrown open and the chicken was being shared around. “Thankfully the four-wheel drive guys had the cooking equipment, they’ve been fabulous cooking for everyone. Everyone’s getting a hot breakfast, everyone got supper last night,” McNae says. Clark Luckman, from the Central Coast, was part of a convoy of five vehicles bound for Fraser Island. Luckman and his friends were set up under the tunnel running the impromptu community kitchen. “People were bringing up sausages and whatever they could,” Luckman says. “But they weren’t bringing it up for themselves, they were bringing it up for everybody. It’s been a real coming together, a team effort.” Formula for a four-month-old baby was sourced by truck drivers getting on the two-way radio. Fold-up chairs have been shared around, with elderly people or those unwell getting first choice. A raided removal truck provided a few more seating options. Despite the relative positivity, everyone is clearly weary and there is frustration at the lack of responsiveness from authorities. McNae says they were told by transport officials in person yesterday not to drive through the flood waters up ahead, but then the officials left and didn’t return. “We’re invisible to the authorities,” McNae says. “They’re very busy, I can appreciate that. But phone calls went unanswered to various government departments. The SES and NSW police are buried basically and we’re not on their radar.” Further along the highway, many are furious, as much at the lack of information as the dearth of food and water. Sheree Guyder, from Brisbane, spent the night with her three children aged eight to 16 after their holiday was cut short. “Google Maps said it would be a four-minute delay here … 24 hours later!” she said. Her comments are reflected widely. Locals lamented on Monday that Google Maps showed the Gold Coast was still within reach for travellers, despite the roads being closed. Darcy Chadwick is stuck further south near Pottsville, in a group of 50 people who spent the night on an overpass above the highway. Food there was in short supply, but still shared widely. “Someone – a local farmer I think – brought down a box of bananas and a box of passionfruit and then someone who was also stuck had like a tray of prawns in an esky. So we all got one prawn, a banana and a passionfruit,” Chadwick says. “And then a lady was offering what she had, which was like non-alcoholic gin spritz things. She was handing them around.” Chadwick, a Tweed local, knew the highway was closed but expected it to retreat with the high tide as has happened previously. What she couldn’t know was the sheer deluge of water coming their way. In Chinderah, near where the highway is cut, the major flood level is 2.0 metres. Last night it reached 2.95 metres, well beyond the floods of 2017 and 1954. By Tuesday lunchtime the river had retreated to 2.7 metres but there was still the prospect of people spending a second night sleeping in their cars. Kym and John Hardcastle have it better than most, having been camping with their dog Molly in their motorhome at Evans Head when they set off back for their Gold Coast home. “We’ve got luxury here, with the motorhome. Although I can’t say I’ve ever free-camped in the middle of the M1 before,” Kym says. “This is probably the riskiest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”",News/Australia news,‘Everyone got supper’: drivers stranded by floods on motorway set up food kitchens for fellow travellers ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/everyone-got-supper-drivers-stranded-by-floods-on-motorway-set-up-food-kitchens-for-fellow-travellers
3/1/2022,"Given their exposure to the most miserable conditions, particularly the relentlessly waterlogged ground and overgrazed sward, I’m surprised that the dead sheep on nearby fields numbered just four last month. One upside to this mortality was that the local ravens made light weather of a sodden winter. “From a worm to a whale” is the phrase that best summarises the astonishing prey range taken by the world’s largest songbird. A scour of my library, however, threw up two delicious titbits that I’ve never previously encountered: vulture vomit and an American passage that talked of ravens “fighting for the steaming dung as soon as dropped by dogs”. This same book also described one of my favourite birds as a “filthy feeder”. Yet the thing that struck me from hours of watching ravens is the complexity of their behaviour around food. Out of a maximum of 24 birds, there were rarely more than four or five on the carcass at once. The others hopped about comically, or played with pieces of windblown vegetation, or circled overhead, sometimes in sonorous voice, and partaking of closely synchronised pair-bonding flights. Vultures will famously gorge until an individual can be too heavy to take off and must rest overnight. But the ravens seemed far more fastidious. There was generally little aggression, which was presumably mediated by some lovely moments of dominance display. Individuals occasionally puffed out their splendid throat hackles and raised over each eye a stiff ridge of black plumelets, which made the whole head look disproportionately enormous and gave to it odd associations with military costume. Another notable detail was the period spent resting after each visit to the carcass, when birds sat on adjacent posts as they processed the contents of their presumably full crop. For all this there was no doubting their ravenous purpose. There was one glorious moment when snow in huge flakes raked the landscape and swept through my telescope image like heavy static on an electric screen. Beyond it, I could just make out ravens beautifully aligned in the lea of a swollen sheep’s belly, but tugging and jabbing with flint beaks as they sheltered from the elements.
