12/29/2021,"A Texas cop who called the Capitol riot one of the best days of her life has been fired. An arbitrator upheld the Bexar County Sheriff's decision to fire Lt. Roxanne Mathai. Mathai posted photos to Facebook that showed her outside the Capitol on January 6. She has not been charged. A Texas sheriff's lieutenant who was at the Capitol on January 6 and called the insurrection one of the best days of her life has been fired, local news outlet KSAT12 reported. Bexar County Sheriff's Office lieutenant Lt. Roxanne Mathai, 47, was placed on administrative leave in January after she posted multiple photos to Facebook near the US Capitol on January 6, KSAT reported. Sheriff Javier Salazar officially fired Mathai in June, but she appealed his decision, according to KSAT. When the case was brought before an arbitrator, she argued that she was present for a historic event and was wrongfully terminated. Since Mathai said she didn't enter the Capitol, she also argued that she was not involved in the siege, local CBS affiliate KENS5 reported. Salazar called her defense ""ridiculous"" in an interview with KSAT on Monday. ""It's not like you're standing there for the signing of the Declaration of Independence. That's a historic event,"" Salazar said. ""You're there when fellow Americans lost their lives. That's nothing to be proud of."" The arbitrator ultimately sided with Salazar and upheld Mathai's firing from her post, according to KSAT. BCOS and Mathai's attorney did not respond to Insider's request for comment. Mathai has not been criminally charged for her involvement at the Capitol on January 6 and has previously claimed she was unaware of the bloodshed at the event, KSAT reported. Among photos of the scene posted to her Facebook page that showed her walking toward the Capitol after hearing President Donald Trump's speech, Mathai also wrote ""......And we are going in......in the crowd at the stairs...not inside the capitol like the others. Not catching a case lol."" ""Not gonna lie.....aside from my kids, this was, indeed, the best day of my life. And it's not over yet,"" Mathai wrote in a separate Facebook post, according to news reports. According to KENS, Mathai had been an employee of the BCOS for eight years. Mathai told KENS in June that she does not regret going to the Capitol that day, but regrets ""the events that happened — the events that I had no participation in — I do regret that those things happened."" More than 700 people have been charged in the Capitol insurrection so far.

12/29/2021,"By Jan Wolfe (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump has resolved a dispute with the PGA of America over the golf association's decision earlier this year to pull a major professional tournament from a Trump-owned golf course, the PGA of America said. In a press release, the PGA said it had reached a confidential settlement with the Trump Organization that resolves legal claims stemming from its decision in the wake of the storming of the U.S. Capitol to shun Trump's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""While the terms of the settlement will remain confidential, representatives from both the PGA and the Trump Organization expressed satisfaction with the agreement,"" the press release stated. The PGA of America said on Jan. 10 it was stripping Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, of the 2022 PGA Championship, one of four prestigious majors on the annual golf calendar, following a vote by its board of directors. “It has become clear that conducting the PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand,” PGA of America President Jim Richerson said in a video announcing the decision. Four people died on the day of the Jan. 6 riots, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. More than 100 police officers were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives. More than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the assault on the Capitol. The PGA press release did not say whether Trump golf courses will host future PGA tournaments. ""We look forward to continuing to support the mission of the PGA and its Professionals, who are the best in the golf industry,"" Eric Trump, a son of the former president and a Trump Organization executive, said in a statement included as part of the press release.

12/29/2021,"Two pieces of good news about omicron to take into the new year: It may not be around for long, and people who are fully vaccinated don't need to worry, as long as they have a healthy immune system. Because omicron is so incredibly contagious, medical experts say its peak isn't likely to last long. It's already burned through South Africa since it was first identified the day before Thanksgiving and cases are falling there. In the week ending Dec. 26, the number of newly diagnosed had dropped nearly 36% from their peak a week earlier, according to a USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. If the northeast, which has been battered by COVID-19's omicron variant over the past two weeks, follows the same pattern, it could see falling case rates as soon as mid-January, though since the U.S. is so large, it's likely to take time to move across the country, experts say. The news is even better for people with the vaccine. Although two shots are not as protective against omicron as they were against previous variants, vaccination and boosting seems to make a big difference in people with a healthy immune system. Those with three shots who get infected seem to suffer just a bad sore throat and some fatigue and muscle pain for a few days, Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency room physician in New York City, said Monday in a Twitter thread. People who've had two shots get somewhat worse symptoms. ""More fatigued. More fever. More coughing. A little more miserable overall,"" he wrote. Those who've had just one shot, he said, fared worse, feeling horrible for a number of days. ""Not great, but not life-threatening."" Virtually all of those who have to be admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, said Spencer, who works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. ""Every one with profound shortness of breath. Every one whose oxygen dropped when they walked. Every one needing oxygen to breathe regularly."" Doctors at other hospitals corroborated his account. Vaccinated people simply have fewer symptoms and are sick for shorter periods, several said. The one exception are those whose immune systems are weak, perhaps because of medication or old age. ""The immunocompromised and people who are particularly frail – there we have to be careful,"" said Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""That's an important group that despite vaccination haven't been fully protected."" The number of patients at Mass. General has more than doubled in the past two weeks, from about 40 to 45 with COVID-19 during the delta wave to now over 100 as omicron has taken over, Gandhi said. Phone calls to the hospital have skyrocketed, too, with more than 500 asking for information over Christmas weekend, he said, referring to it as ""an unprecedented number."" Omicron has also made it trickier to help people stay out of the hospital, Gandhi said. Two of the three monoclonal antibodies routinely given to people at high risk for severe disease no longer work against omicron, while a third, sotrovimab, is in short supply. Two antiviral pills, Paxlovid and molnupiravir, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration last week, are much easier to give and could make a profound difference in the pandemic, Gandhi said. But they're not widely available yet, and he hasn't had any to offer. Although researchers believe omicron may be less dangerous than previous variants, because it's so contagious, it may still land just as many or more people in the hospital, said Jeremy Luban, an infectious disease expert at the UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts. That means a return to the days of trying to ""flatten the curve"" to keep hospitals from getting overwhelmed said Luban and Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease expert at Mass. General, who joined Gandhi and other Massachusetts researchers on a conference call with reporters Monday afternoon. ""We have to hold these two realities of omicron in our mind as we think about how to go forward,"" Lemieux said. ""The picture is not totally bleak. With these new medicines … it really does suggest there's light at the end of the tunnel, but we have to get through the tunnel, and the tunnel is long, and it's looking dark for the next few weeks at least."" By moving so fast and infecting so many people, hopefully in a less serious way, could omicron give lots of people immunity and help hasten the end of the pandemic? Unfortunately, probably not. ""The idea of a less pathogenic virus that could instill cross-protective immunity without causing long-COVID would certainly be a godsend,"" said Dr. Bruce Walker, founding director of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, which focuses on immunology. ""I don't think any of us is willing to say that omicron is it. In fact, I think it's likely that it's not."" Mike Stucka contributed to this report.

12/29/2021,"MANDAN, N.D. (AP) — A man convicted of killing four people in what authorities say was one of the most gruesome crimes in North Dakota history was sentenced Tuesday to multiple life prison terms without the possibility of parole. South Central District Judge David Reich sentenced Chad Isaak, 47, to consecutive life terms for each of his four murder convictions. One of Isaak's lawyers had asked Reich to allow for the possibility of parole. Isaak, wearing a blue mask, stood still and stared straight ahead as the judge delivered his verdicts. Before learning his fate, Isaak briefly addressed the court, saying, “I can honestly tell you I’m not a murderer, and that’s all I have to say.” A jury in August found Isaak guilty of killing RJR Maintenance and Management co-owner Robert Fakler, 52; and employees Adam Fuehrer, 42; Bill Cobb, 50; and his wife, Lois Cobb, 45. The four were shot and stabbed on April 1, 2019, inside the property management company’s building in Mandan, a city of about 20,000 people across the Missouri River from Bismarck. Investigators said the victims were stabbed more than 100 times, total. Before Reich sentenced Isaak, family members of the victims were allowed to address the court. Robert Fakler's wife, Jackie Fakler, called Isaak “a coward” who didn't give the victims a chance to flee or fight. “You have made me hate,” she said. Jackie Fakler also read victim impact statements from the Cobb family, who couldn't make the hearing because of bad weather. Jamie Binstock, a daughter of Robert and Jackie Fakler, told the court that Isaak is a “heinous individual” who should spend the rest of his life in prison and experience a “lifetime of suffering” and nightmares. “I do not want your life to end. Your family does not need to suffer the same way we did,” Binstock said. North Dakota doesn’t have the death penalty. The jury deliberated for more than four hours at the end of the nearly three-week trial before it convicted Isaak of murder, burglary, unlawful entry into a vehicle, and a misdemeanor count of unauthorized use of a vehicle. Isaak, a chiropractor and Navy veteran, lived at a Washburn property that the company managed, but authorities never established a motive for the killings. It was one of the most heinous crimes in North Dakota history, defense attorney Bruce Quick acknowledged during his opening statement. But he maintained that investigators didn’t seriously consider other possible suspects, including people who had either been evicted, sued or fired by RJR. The defense also argued that police failed to check out the ex-husband of a woman who allegedly had an affair with Fakler. “I wanted you to know that these four individuals were wonderful people,” Jackie Fakler said to Isaak. “I thoroughly loved my husband and I forgive him.” In asking the judge to deny Isaak the possibility of parole, prosecutor Gabrielle Goter said Isaak is a danger to the community who hasn’t shown any remorse for the crimes, which she said were “preplanned and premeditated.” The judge agreed. Prosecutors during trial showed security camera footage from numerous businesses that authorities said tracked Isaak’s white pickup truck from Mandan to Washburn on the day of the killings, along with footage from a week earlier that they said indicated the killer had planned out the attack. Forensic experts testified that fibers on the clothing of the slain workers matched fibers taken from Isaak’s clothing, and that DNA evidence found in Isaak’s truck was linked to Fakler and possibly Lois Cobb. Prosecutors presented the case as a puzzle in which all of the pieces pointed to Isaak, including a knife found in his washing machine and gun parts found in his freezer. ___ This story was updated to correct that the prosecutor who asked the judge to deny Isaak the possibility of parole was Gabrielle Goter, not Karlei Neufeld. ___ Associated Press writer Dave Kolpack in Fargo, North Dakota, contributed to this report.",U.S./Associated Press,North Dakota man convicted of killing 4 gets life in prison,https://news.yahoo.com/north-dakota-man-convicted-grisly-035500090.html
