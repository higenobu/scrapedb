5/7/2022,"Ujarneq Egede’s farm sits among a cluster of compact houses and squat barns on the snowy slopes of Equaluit Ilua in southern Greenland. The journey from Narsaq, the nearest town, involves a 30 minute boat trip across the fjord, mooring on a sheet of ice and a snowmobile ride up to the farm. This is the biggest island in the world, yet Greenland’s population is tiny – less than 57,000 of whom nearly 90% are Inuit, concentrated around the jagged coastline. The country’s remoteness is extreme: there are no roads or railways between towns and settlements. Transport is only by boat, helicopter and propeller planes – ice, winds and storms permitting. Narsaq itself is a small town of about 1,300 people, where jobs revolve around fishing, farming, a slaughterhouse and summer tourism. Its population has fallen 25% since 1991. Meanwhile, on his farm, Egede grows potatoes and raises 750 sheep, huddled in barns during the winter and ranging across the grassy mountains throughout summer. To be a farmer in Greenland is to have a front row seat to the climate crisis. Egede tracks the changes – “summer is sometimes really dry, other times there is too much rain. This winter was really late”. Where once they could drive on the frozen fjord during winter, now that never happens, he says. It is not just climate that worries him, however. Egede’s farm is in the shadow of Kvanefjeld, a proposed open-pit uranium and rare earth elements mine. Fearing what it may do to the surrounding environment and his farm, he was immensely relieved when plans for the mine were recently halted after the new government, elected in April 2021, banned uranium mining. But the threat still simmers. Egede is not sure it isover. This southern slice of Greenland, where the main sources of employment include farming, fishing and tourism, has found itself at the sharp end of a quandary the country is reckoning with: how to develop the economy without doing so at the expense of its environment and its people, who rely on the pristine Arctic landscape for their livelihoods. In its own, Greenland way, it is a microcosm of the dilemma facing huge parts of the world. Melting ice sheets and fast-warming temperatures make Greenland a totem for the climate crisis. But as the ice melts, ironically enough, opportunities arise: not only are raw materials easier to access but Greenland is becoming more accessible and tourist seasons are extending. The relatively young government came to power in April 2021 promising pro-environmental policies: it has pledged to join the Paris climate agreement and has banned new licences for oil and gas drilling. But Greenland’s abundant minerals have attracted the attention of countries that are currently dependent on China and Russia for the raw materials needed to build the batteries and wind turbines of the low-carbon economy. Mining may mean Greenland could move away from its financial dependence on Denmark, which gives it a grant of 3.9bn Danish krone (£440m) every year, and towards eventual independence. In Narsaq, the Australian-based Greenland Minerals pitched the Kvanefjeld mine as a source of local opportunity. The pitch failed to impress many, including farmers such as Egede, and Naasu Lund, who lives with her husband and two children on a sheep farm in Inneruulalik, near Narsaq. Lund was part of the anti-mine group Urani? Naamik (Uranium? No). Farmers thought they would be forced to move from farms that had been in their families for generations, says Lund, who also runs horse riding tours from her hydropowered farm. The biggest concern was the tailings pond holding the mining waste, she says, which would remain there for ever. People feared it could spill in Greenland’s fierce weather, reaching the fjord in minutes. Urani? Naamik protested – at public consultations, through local campaigning and finally through votes. And it worked. “This is the first time I can sit in my home and think about a future that is not involved with mining,” Lund says. Whether the mine is over is uncertain, however. Greenland Minerals has launched arbitration proceedings to “clarify the company’s position and to protect our shareholders’ considerable investment in Kvanefjeld”, according to a spokesperson, who added that a detailed environmental impact assessment had addressed all concerns about the mine. “Even under the most extreme assumptions there would not be any exceedance of WHO drinking water standards resulting from dispersal of tailings material during foehn winds [strong gusty winds].” While Greenland’s government may be saying no to uranium, it is open to other mining and the warming climate may make projects more feasible. “Mineral deposits are exposed that had previously been under ice,” says Josephine Nymand of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. In March, Kobold Minerals, which has investment from Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, and the UK-based Bluejay Mining announced they would begin exploring for nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals. Bo Stensgaard, the CEO of Bluejay Mining, says the project will operate to the “highest standards” environmentally and benefit Greenlanders through jobs and training. But there is no timeframe for when mining might start. Herein lies the problem, says Lill Rastad Bjørst, associate professor at Aalborg University – there is a lot of talk but “close to nothing is happening”. Greenland currently has only two mines, one producing rubies and another anorthosite. Despite claims about how Greenlanders benefit from mining, “at the moment, there might be people who benefit from this development, but it’s not the people living in Greenland”, Bjørst says. Could tourism be the answer? “We advocate for tourism,” says Idrissia Thestrup, of Visit Greenland, “because we believe by preserving nature, we can actually avoid taking the resources in the land and potentially destroying landscapes.” Tourism was one of the country’s fastest growing industries until Covid lockdowns brought it to a shuddering halt. But 2022 will be a boom year, says Henrik Ebbe Nielsen, a tourism teacher at Campus Kujalleq, in Qaqortoq, south Greenland’s largest town. Qaqortoq alone expects to see an estimated 41 cruise ships this summer, spilling up to 47,000 tourists on to its winding, pavement-less streets. Visitor numbers may be boosted further by an airport expansion project. Qaqortoq will get a brand new airport, with construction starting this spring, and new runways will allow larger, international planes to land in the capital, Nuuk, and Ilulissat, a town famed for its iceberg-calving glacier and dog sledding. But bigger airports mean more aeroplanes, more emissions and more tourists. In some areas, “the local landscape is very much affected by too many tourists already”, says Bjørst. Thestrup says framing Greenland’s airport growth as a climate problem ignores its tiny contribution to the climate crisis and its extreme remoteness. But she acknowledges the need to tread carefully. “We want tourism to be a driver for economic growth but we want to do it at a pace that respects the nature and culture of our destination.” Greenland’s prime minister, Múte B Egede, recently set out his vision for a “resilient economy”, one that would ultimately phase out fossil fuels. Alongside fishing, rare earth mining and tourism, he predicts a future for far less tested industries, including using Greenland’s abundant hydropower resources with captured CO2 emissions to create green fuels for export. “As the ‘face’ of climate change,” he wrote in an editorial, “Greenland wants to lead by example.” For now, the country is trying to plot a path towards increased economic freedom, while staking its claim for climate leadership. It is a path filled with uncertainty, especially as the climate crisis starts to alter people’s way of life, but uncertainty is something Greenlanders are used to. “You cannot sit down and cry, it doesn’t help, you have to just adapt,” Lund says. “We can do it right,” she adds. “Greenland is a very sustainable country but it’s also the Arctic – nature doesn’t fix itself very fast after being destroyed, you have to be careful, it’s very fragile.” Travel support for this piece was provided by the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY",News/World news,‘Nature doesn’t fix itself fast’: Greenland weighs up economy v climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/greenland-weighs-up-economy-v-climate-crisis
5/7/2022,"Ilogged into my social media feed on a cold, midwestern spring morning and was greeted with a post by a major magazine. It was a link to 30 Mother’s Day songs that, the article claimed, “will tug at her heart strings”. Being a daughter who has, despite supreme effort, only managed to tug at her own mother’s heart strings in all the wrong ways, I decided against reading it. The last thing I needed was another gushing reminder of the relationship that evolution and society say I’m supposed to have, but do not. I’m 41 years old, and my mother and I haven’t breathed a single word to each other in more than three years. The reasons for our estrangement are complicated, and far from uncommon – but most certainly taboo. My mother and I always had a confusing relationship. While there were certainly good times between us, there was also an unpredictable undercurrent of toxicity, dysfunction and rage weaving through our life together. She had made considerable sacrifices for me, but as I entered adulthood it became clear that my boundaries – mostly the need to be my own person unencumbered by unsolicited opinions, parental guilt trips and other forms of emotional manipulation – were incompatible with what my mother wanted from me: full and speedy compliance with whatever she demanded. I learned the hard way that I had zero capacity to make her happy, and therapy gave me permission to stop imagining that it was my job to do so. Many people are at a loss for how to respond when I admit to having put my own mother in a permanent timeout for the sake of my sanity. Responses ran the gamut, from “but you only get one mother” to “I couldn’t imagine not speaking to my mother” and “you’re lucky. My mother’s dead. What I would give to be able to hear her voice again.” Many went as far as to suggest that the responsibility for my relationship with my mother rested squarely on my shoulders, as if I were strictly to blame for the dynamic between us. Before my years in therapy, Mother’s Day mania used to heighten my insecurities. The multibillion-dollar hype surrounding this holiday has a dark side for those of us with difficult relationships to loved ones, and the onslaught of Perfect Mother marketing often feels noxious to the large number of adult children working through traumatic relationships with their maternal caregivers. And yes – there are a lot of us around. A study on mother-daughter estrangement conducted by researchers at Ohio State University recently found that 52% of the mothers surveyed were estranged from a daughter. Forty-five per cent reported estrangement from a son. Research conducted by sociologist Karl Pillemer found that 25% of people are actively estranged from a family member at any given time. Given the statistics, you’d think that society would catch up and back off – or at least make some space for the rest of us. Still, trying to avoid Mother’s Day during the weeks-long rush of aggressive ad campaigning is like trying to avoid air. To find a way to coexist among those who celebrate their mothers, I found myself spending more time with my older female friends, some of whom are nearly twice my age. Looking back, I believe this was a subconscious effort: without anywhere else to turn, I began to honor the motherly figures in my friendships for the important roles they played in my life. My strongest maternal relationships are now with women who are not related to me and who haven’t watched me grow up – but they care for me and my wellbeing as if I were their daughter. Best of all, they’ve never projected their beliefs on to me about what my relationship with my mother should be. They’ve brought a wisdom and depth to our friendship that were hard to find elsewhere. In the years since my estrangement I moved cross-country; I’ve changed jobs and advanced my career; I’ve gotten married; I’ve realized a lifelong dream by securing a book deal with a children’s book publisher. I’ve become an aunt four times over and adopted a rescue cat. No matter how large or small the event, my maternal surrogates have celebrated all of them. Cynthia, a grandmother and my former neighbor, threw me three going-away parties upon learning that I’d be moving from our upper midwestern town in Wisconsin to marry my fiance, who lived several states and one time zone away. An amazing baker, Cynthia made me a forest-themed cake complete with a ceramic chipmunk topper. The decorative critter sits on my mantel in my new home. Kim, a widow I met when I first moved to Wisconsin, introduced me to her family. We’d take long walks and, in her southern drawl, she’d regale me with stories about growing up in New Orleans. We saw each other often, sharing our deepest feelings over homemade appetizers and glasses of wine. Both Kim and Cynthia offered warm meals when I was too busy, sick or tired to keep up. They lent wisdom and encouraging words during difficult times, and when I lived nearby I’d often arrive home to find flowers and baked goods on my doorstep, just because. Since my move we have stayed in touch, especially through the pandemic. They continue to play a maternal role in my life and we send each other cards and lengthy texts with updates about our lives, much like I imagine many mothers and daughters do. Their care has made all the difference to my mental health. When I’d otherwise be wallowing in self-pity and dread for the upcoming Mother’s Day weekend, I’m reminded of Kim, Cynthia and other women dear to me who provided comfort when my relationship with my mother imploded. They assured me that I was worthy of maternal love no matter how I’d been made to feel by others. It is through these women that I’ve learned that mothers can take different forms – matching DNA not required.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"This Mother’s Day, I’m choosing my friends instead",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/07/mothers-day-choosing-friends-instead
5/7/2022,"When is a perfume not a perfume? When it’s a hairspray so thoughtfully scented that a waft of lacquer could legitimately pass for fine fragrance. Perfumed haircare is on the rise. Its pioneer was undoubtedly the late, great hairstylist Oribe Canales. Canales (known simply as Oribe, pronounced “OR-bay”) was, in 2008, the first to engage a pair of high-end perfumers to create a luxury fragrance for use in hair products. The result was Côte d’Azur, a blend of apples, bergamot, sandalwood, amber, tuberose, jasmine and vetiver that is widely adored by the beauty community. It smells so good – and is so expensive – that although it is now also available in perfume form (£121 for 75ml), one of my friends cheerfully says her signature scent is Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray. Similarly, fans of the American haircare brand Ouai were so taken with its products’ scents that the firm bottled them as perfume. And signature shampoos and conditioners from dpHue smell so good that a matching home fragrance candle is on its way. I myself have been known to use hairsprays from Sam McKnight not only for the hairdresser’s signature “cool girl” mussed-up texture, but also for a hit of the sublime scent created especially for McKnight by British perfumer Lyn Harris. Inspired by the lingering aroma of McKnight’s beloved London garden after a heavy downpour, Harris’s creation is a blissful blend of wet herbs, roses and an almost steamy accord that is at once refined and sexy. One perfume PR – who has no professional connection with McKnight – tells me that Lazy Girl dry shampoo (at £19 it’s a fraction of the price of one of Harris’s perfumes) is his “special occasion fragrance”. Kate Moss is also a fan. Celebrity hairdresser Adam Reed is also a fanatical perfume collector, keen on the psychological benefits of fragrance. For his new Arkive range of “headcare” and hairstyling products, Reed prioritised smell as highly as performance. Arkive incorporates two layerable scents – Future Bloom, a white floral with warm vanilla and tart rhubarb; and, my favourite, No One Elsie (Reed’s beloved nan’s name), a mouthwatering blend of green tomato leaves, more rhubarb, honeysuckle and redcurrant. The latter features in The New Form (£13), a blow-dry spray that leaves my hair glossy, silky, bouncy and smelling like a hot, 1980s greenhouse that I’m loth to ever leave.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Who needs perfume?

5/7/2022,"Always outspoken, always entertaining, Willy T Ribbs has never pulled punches. On the eve of the Miami Grand Prix the groundbreaking, black American driver is typically effusive in his admiration for Lewis Hamilton, who he believes has fundamentally changed Formula One. “I knew before I met him he was the second coming,” he says. “You won’t see another driver who will achieve as much as Lewis Hamilton in 200 years.” Ribbs is bold and confident, the 67-year-old speaking with authority and wit, a smile never far from his lips having earned his place in racing’s history the hard way. Ribbs was the first black driver to test an F1 car, doing so for Bernie Ecclestone’s Brabham team in 1986 at Estoril and the first African-American to qualify and then race at the Indy 500 in 1991. Over a long career he overcame racism that ran the gamut from what he describes as “opposition, barriers and denial based on one thing: the colour of my skin” right up to death threats, but faced it down with a fearless swagger. “It could demoralise a lot of people, I wasn’t that way,” he says. “I love fighting. It builds character and I was going to fight until I couldn’t breathe any more.” This weekend in Miami, F1 is celebrating its new-found success in the US. There are two races in the country this year for the first time since 1984, next year with Las Vegas added to Miami and Texas there will be three. Ribbs is pleased that the sport he has loved since he was in diapers is once more on the up in the USA but maintains that Hamilton’s integral part in that should be recognised. “When I used to talk with Muhammad Ali, he said to me that all people congregate to champions no matter what colour you are and Lewis is in that Muhammad Ali league,” he says. “He is now on that level as far as interest from all people, especially people of colour who have never had that before, who have never had a representative that looked like them. “Now Lewis Hamilton in this country is a huge name with African-Americans and people of colour. He is worldwide but in this country he is mega. The sport has got him now, he has opened it up and brought attention to millions and millions of people of colour all over the world. That is the greatest thing for Formula One, right now it is a crossover sport, with crossover appeal.” The T stands for Theodore but is always truncated. When his name is mentioned to former world champion Mario Andretti, the great man immediately says: “Ah, Willy T”, with fondness. Ribbs is now a diversity and inclusion representative for F1, an initiative that was effectively kickstarted when Hamilton insisted F1 needed to address these issues while he was championing the Black Lives Matter movement. Ribbs was enthusiastic to get involved, recognising how much work there was to be done. He had raced from when he came to Europe to pursue his dream in 1975 until 2001 across a wide range of disciplines including IndyCar, Champ Car, Trans-Am, Nascar and Imsa. He took 17 victories in the Trans-Am series but had grown up loving F1, amid family dinner table conversations in California about Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark and Stirling Moss. Learning his craft in the UK, Ribbs bashed wheels with Nigel Mansell in Formula Ford at Brands Hatch, with both drivers finishing on the podium, an experience he remembers with a broad grin. “We banged it up during the race, it was absolutely ruthless and fun but clean,” he says. “After the race we went around the track on the back of that truck with our laurel wreaths on, we shook hands and Nigel and I are still buddies today, I love him to death.” He recalls how he was welcomed to the UK with open arms by Stirling Moss and John Surtees, how they only saw a quick driver and that he did not want his race to define him. “I thought of myself as a race driver not as a driver of any particular colour. I didn’t consider Jim Clark or Graham Hill or Jochen Rindt or any of those guys anything other than race drivers. I didn’t see them as white race drivers, I looked at them as great race drivers.” In 1986 the test did not turn into a drive with Brabham but Ribbs was pleased to have a shot. At Indianapolis in 1991 he was roundly cheered as he dragged his underperforming car through qualifying to make the race, his elation clear as he rolled through the pitlane, arms aloft. However on a weekend where the car chewed through six engine changes, the race was a disappointment with the sixth giving out on lap five. Undeterred he returned to the Brickyard in 1993 and this time made the flag in 21st place. He was not considering the impacts his achievements would have at the time, viewing them only as part of his ambition to be the best driver he could. Yet his legacy as the first black driver to make these steps was vital as he now acknowledges, not least by Hamilton who has invited him as a guest to races. “In 2012 at the US GP I talked to his father Anthony and he said: ‘I followed you and you were one of the reasons I wanted Lewis to be an F1 driver,’” he says. Ribbs believes Hamilton is doing similarly inspiring work in ensuring F1 has an audience for the future in the US but of course has a singularly Willy T take on it. “I see Lewis as the best ambassador for diversity and inclusion and I see Willy T Ribbs as the second-best ambassador. We got the front row,” he says with an expansive laugh. “To have Lewis and Willy T to be the chassis with F1 as the engine, it is the greatest thing for the sport you are going to see right now in America, F1 has never been bigger.”",Sport/Sport,"Hamilton, hope and making history: Willy T Ribbs’ pioneering F1 path",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/willy-t-ribbs-pioneering-f1-path-lewis-hamilton
5/7/2022,"Somewhere at the bottom of the North Sea is a mobile phone which may hold the evidence Coleen Rooney needs to win next week’s “Wagatha Christie” libel trial at the high court in London. Unfortunately for the footballer’s wife, her only hope of retrieving the device – and any relevant WhatsApp messages it could still hold – is if a fishing trawler happens to dredge up the phone before her case starts on Monday. The celebrity libel trial of year is finally due to get under way after more than £1m in legal fees, the publication of excruciating private conversations, and revelations about the interactions between footballer’s wives and tabloid journalists. On one side is Coleen Rooney, who has spent most of her life in the public eye as the wife of former England player Wayne Rooney. Stories about her private life have always been catnip to the tabloid press, with paparazzi once receiving many thousands of pounds for exclusive photographs of her. Almost three years ago Rooney ran an elaborate sting operation to try to catch the person who was leaking stories about her family from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun. On the other side is Rebekah Vardy, the wife of Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy, a late arrival on the footballers’ wives scene who – court disclosures suggest – had conversations with her agent about selling stories about a drink-driving incident involving her husband’s ex-teammate Danny Drinkwater to journalists at the Sun. In one exchange she appeared to suggest that her agent passed a story to the tabloid newspaper and added: “I want paying for this x”. After Rooney’s extensive sleuthing as to who was leaking from her Instagram – earning her the nickname “Wagatha Christie” – in October 2019 she made the public accusation that launched the lengthy proceedings: “Now I know for certain which account / individual it’s come from. I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It’s............ Rebekah Vardy’s account.” The issue is that Vardy has always denied being the leaker and starting legal proceedings, claiming Rooney defamed her with a false allegation. Under English libel law, it is up to Rooney to justify her original accusation. And, amid the accidental loss of potentially key evidence by Vardy and her team, Rooney has yet to locate a smoking gun. Take the phone at the bottom of the North Sea, which belonged to Vardy’s agent Caroline Watt. Last summer, with legal proceedings in full swing, Rooney’s lawyers asked to search the device for WhatsApp messages that could help their case. The high court heard that shortly afterwards – and before the phone could be searched – Watt was on a boat trip off the British coast when it hit a large wave and she accidentally dropped her mobile phone into the sea, losing its contents. The incident was described as “most unfortunate” by Rooney’s lawyers. A separate set of potentially relevant WhatsApp messages held by Vardy was backed up by her IT expert but the court heard that they had unfortunately “forgotten the password”. The laptop Vardy used during the relevant period is no longer working. Watt’s Twitter account has also been deleted. Jamie Vardy himself lost access to his WhatsApp messages, with the court informed they had been hacked. And the Sun is resisting attempts to disclose any messages from Watt and Vardy potentially held by its reporter Andy Halls, citing the rights of a free press and journalists to protects their sources. In response, Rooney’s lawyers claim they are being denied a fair trial due to a lack of evidence. Mark Stephens QC, a leading media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, told the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast that the case was “almost unique in libel history, because it’s untrammelled by evidence”. He added: “Destroying evidence deliberately is a very serious matter. But there’s no suggestion that that happened. It does seem there was an unfortunate series of events which has meant this case can’t be properly proved.” The defining moment in the case may have come with a court ruling in late 2020. While Rooney had originally written that “Rebekah Vardy’s account” was responsible for leaking the Instagram stories to the Sun, Mr Justice Warby ruled that the true meaning of those words – on which the libel trial will be fought – was that Vardy was personally responsible for the leaking. As a result Rooney either has to prove it was Vardy herself – rather than someone else with access to Vardy’s Instagram account – who leaked stories to the Sun, or convince a judge that the publication of the allegation was in the public interest. In the absence of conclusive evidence, Rooney and her legal team have instead had to build a case based on inference. They argue that since Vardy had dealings with the Sun and talked about selling stories to the newspaper it is reasonable to conclude she was the leaker on this occasion. The court also heard that Vardy, for her part, has suggested at the last minute that Watt, her agent, may have “betrayed” her and leaked the relevant stories without her knowledge. On Monday a six-day trial will get under way. Watt now says she is too unwell to give evidence but Wayne Rooney could be called as a witness. There is a waiting list for tickets to attend the small wood-panelled Victorian courtroom in central London, with officials already arranging an overspill room given the level of media interest in the case. Vardy’s reputation has taken a further battering as a result of her decision to bring the libel case, after messages showed her saying she would “love” to leak stories about Rooney and may have called her supposed friend a “bitch”. However, Vardy could decide it was a gamble worth winning if she is vindicated by a libel win – with the loser facing a million-pound legal bill. Stephens said Rooney’s team face an uphill challenge under English libel law: “I think that Vardy wins this on a technicality because there’s no evidence that Coleen has that can prove it.” Listen to the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast on the case: Part One Part Two",News/Media,Mystery of phone in North Sea could hold key to Wagatha Christie case,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/07/coleen-rooney-rebekah-vardy-wagatha-christie-libel-case
5/7/2022,"Ioften think I must be quite annoying on social media. Looking through someone else’s eyes, I’d probably find some of my (masterful) tweets vapid or obnoxious. The selfies on my Instagram Stories? They’d give me the ick. And as for the constant pictures of my dog … actually, let’s not get too carried away. Do my haters complain about me to their friends? I’d be surprised if anyone cares that much. But like most narcissistic paranoias I still think it’s a possibility, because this is exactly what I do with the (many) people I find annoying online. It’s one thing to deride people I don’t know for oversharing or being arrogant, ill-informed and cringe online, but my conscience kicks in when I find myself at odds with the social media presence of “real life” friends. There are two in particular whom I care about a lot. When we hang out in person I absolutely love them, but on Instagram they are guilty of serious crimes. The charges include: constantly posting pictures of expensive things they’ve bought; “inspirational” quotes about the importance of “hard work”; and exercise at the crack of dawn. If I don’t see these friends in person for a while, I begin to forget the version of them I like. But when we catch up, everything changes. I message afterwards saying, “It was SO good seeing you, let’s not leave it so long next time!”, knowing that one reason it took so long is my disdain for their social media presence. These tensions aren’t surprising, because social media platforms want us to be exaggerated, annoying versions of ourselves. We’re encouraged to post in an extreme (and often cringe-inducing) way in order to gain likes and followers, while at the same time making ourselves vulnerable to criticism. This criticism – whether it’s in the form of post-posting paranoia or actual negative comments – can degrade our mental wellbeing, which is already run down by the constant online bombardment of content that makes us worry about how we look, our lifestyles, our careers and our opinions. (The more we click on it, the more the algorithm shows us.) Posting in a way that conflicts with what we’re like in “real life” could be a coping mechanism or a way of projecting the person we’d like to be. Working out where people best fit into our lives is an important social skill. We all have friends who are better than others at giving advice, or on a raucous night out. Some are much better one on one, whereas others come to life in a bigger group. Certain work friendships go beyond office walls, whereas others do not. Social media adds another dimension to this: friendships that are best enjoyed online v offline. We should embrace the fact that friendships don’t always thrive in both spaces. This is why I’ve muted some good friends, former colleagues and extended family members on social media recently. I’ve realised that if their output is annoying me, they’re probably posting for a different audience. Perhaps I’m seeing their “professional” persona – a side of them I don’t recognise. Or maybe I’m more irritated by them triggering my insecurities. (Am I just jealous of the expensive purchases my friends brag about? Probably. Does their cult-like devotion to waking up early make me feel guilty for sleeping in? Definitely.) Muting your friends might sound harsh, but if you care about them it’s a small price to maintain a relationship that might otherwise become strained or distant. I’ve realised that there are much worse crimes than being a bit irritating on social media, particularly if I know someone is a good person in real life. (And I hope my friends agree with that, because my posts are definitely more annoying than theirs.)

5/7/2022,"“It’s heaviest of all for the boys,” says Irina as she watches her son, Denys, play one-twos with a new teammate on an artificial surface in Warsaw’s northern suburbs. “His father isn’t here, and his older brother joined the army. It’s just the two of us. The language barrier is hard for me, but I’m willing to go through all the difficulties. Everything we’re doing now” – she motions to a fellow Ukrainian mother, standing along the touchline – “is for the sake of our children’s future.” Denys is one of nine young Ukrainian footballers given a place to play by Turbo Academy, one of the most highly regarded setups in Poland. Most are 13 or 14; they held genuine hope of careers in the game before Russia invaded their country and, while safety was the primary consideration upon leaving, maintaining their prospects was a vital factor too. Football has virtually ground to a halt while Ukraine is defended but Turbo are among numerous clubs in Europe trying to help its budding stars. “Back home, our boys would put football before everything else,” Irina says. “But now our house has been destroyed, the pitches bombed, and there is no way they can stay. Here, they are being given a chance.” Most of Turbo’s intake are from the academy of the second-tier club FK Kramatorsk, 50 miles north of Donetsk in Ukraine’s intensely troubled east. Irina and Denys were exceptions: they had, in fact, moved to Kyiv shortly before the invasion. Denys was ready to join Shakhtar’s youth setup, which is based there, when life turned upside down. On 25 March the youngsters arrived, six with their mothers, at the Polish border town of Medyka. Turbo’s goalkeeping coach, Grzegorz Jedrzejewski, had learned from a contact that a group of Ukrainian players were looking to leave. With help from the Polish Football Association, he arranged for a bus to collect them. “We’d been waiting for a week to find out when they were coming,” Jedrzejewski says. “They had been sheltering in basements, but then they decided the time was right to leave because of all the bombs, and I got the call. They travelled from Kramatorsk to Kyiv, then on to Medyka. I waited at the border, at night, shouting out names from a list. It was a group of people who had no idea what they would be doing from one day to the next. Only when I got there did I fully understand what Putin has done.” An intervention from the local mayor ensured that, once in Warsaw, the boys and their mothers could all be accommodated at a local boarding school. Sessions with Turbo, in an integrated group with the local players, are held every evening apart from Tuesday. “It was so important that we made sure they could live with their mothers, and offered something more than just training,” Jedrzejewski says. “Thankfully we managed that. “The main thing is that, in every minute of their football training, they can forget about the war. We can see that they are smiling, not crying or appearing sad.” A couple of miles to the south, around the corner from the apartment she now shares with her son Dima, Oksana is drinking coffee and calmly outlining the decisions taken over the past two months. Dima turns 14 this summer but was a centre-forward for Metalist Kharkiv’s under-15s, and considered a major talent in his age group, when their city came under attack. “He would wake at 5am every morning and go to training,” she says. “He’d come home, shower, go to school and then train again in the evening. All he’s wanted to do since he was seven is become a footballer and his coaches think he can make it. I just hope that, through all this, he doesn’t lose his enthusiasm to play.” Daily life had been “normal, I think like you have in Great Britain”. Oksana, erudite and watchful, worked as an administrator for a beauty salon and as a translator of technical documents from German to Russian. They left Kharkiv after five days of hearing missiles land nearby and aircraft roar overhead. She recounts the story of their escape, and subsequent journey: such tales have become horrifyingly familiar and each is as important as the next. At a Ukrainian army checkpoint near Vinnytsia a tall, burly officer was moved to tears when he heard the situation they had come from. Whenever Dima, who had been playing at a tournament in Mariupol with Metalist on 23 February, saw a football pitch during the 800-mile drive he would sigh: “I just want to play.” He got his wish: one of the volunteers who had greeted the pair, a woman named Marta, had connections to the local club Polonia. Dima was, remarkably, training there less than 24 hours after arriving in Poland; at the time of our meeting, Oksana was awaiting clearance that would allow him to represent them competitively. Metalist’s coaches are in frequent contact and have offered total support. “The Polonia coach likes him a lot, so we’re waiting for that,” she says. “In the meantime, he loves training and it’s good for him because it means his thoughts are far away from what’s happening in Ukraine. “His school in Kharkiv has been destroyed by a bomb; we understand none of this will finish quickly and that we’ll have to build a new life here. If I had a younger child, in kindergarten, perhaps I would be in more of a rush to return. But I have to think about Dima’s life and his football career; the fact he will soon be old enough for university too. We can’t waste his time.” Oksana proudly shows off Dima’s ID card from the Ukrainian FA. Even as they prepared to leave Kharkiv she was in touch with Metalist, attempting to retrieve his birth certificate – the club had held it for the Mariupol competition – with a view to his playing in Poland. Her dedication to his future is beyond reproach; she worries that Polonia’s relatively spartan facilities may not serve Dima well in the longer run, although her gratitude to them is resoundingly clear. Back at Turbo Academy, Irina and her companions are reflecting on the trauma that continues to be inflicted on their city. It is not long since Kramatorsk’s railway station, crowded with people who were intending to escape, was bombed by the Russians and an estimated 50 lives lost. “I have acquaintances, former neighbours, who were killed by that strike,” Irina says. “This is real life, real people. The situation is terrible. Life is good here and we are being looked after, but our souls remain at home.” Darkness has fallen and training is over. Denys and his teammates, the Ukrainian boys wearing dark colours while more orange club kits are ordered, deploy their collective strength and carry a full-sized goal back to its original spot. There is laughter; good natured shouting; no suggestion of segregation. “In the first squad meeting after they arrived, I introduced them to our boys as heroes,” Jedrzejewski says. “When you see and hear shooting all around you, it’s the end of your childhood. They are here as our friends and colleagues from a different, very difficult place. The football language is universal: we are one team.”",Sport/Football,‘Given a chance’: teenage Ukrainian football talents find hope in Poland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/teenage-ukrainian-football-talents-find-hope-in-poland
5/7/2022,"It’s as West Indian as rice and peas and the barber shop: the slamming down of dominoes – hard – on a table as a group of elderly black men go head to head in a heated game. “If you are West Indian you just can’t play dominoes without making a bit of noise,” says Ernest Theophile, 73, who has been playing dominoes, cards and backgammon with his friends in Maida Hill market square in north London for 12 years. He was served with an injunction banning games in the square after Westminster council received 200 noise complaints. That order was tweaked last year, with a judge saying Theophile and his friends could return to the square – but threatening them with jail if they are caught “playing loud amplified music, drinking alcohol and shouting and swearing”. Theophile is fighting the order, saying it amounts to “racial discrimination”. Inevitably, the case is being portrayed as another “woke row”, but any child of Caribbean origin who grew up in Britain will understand his insistence that dominoes, played the West Indian way, cannot be played quietly. Growing up, I remember huddles of men – including my dad, uncles, family friends –hunched over tables, talking, laughing and remonstrating loudly in smoke-filled rooms, usually with a Red Stripe or Jamaican white rum in hand with reggae music blaring out of the speakers – and the dramatic thud of the dominoes as they crashed on to the table. The banging down of the tiles would get louder and louder, especially if a player was on a roll and looked like they were going to win. Sometimes there would be fallouts, even near-punch-ups – dominoes is a serious thing in the Caribbean community. The game is still so popular in Jamaica that in 2010 the country expressed hopes of it becoming an Olympic sport. My cousins and I would play and look on, often wondering how long these games, which could last for many hours, would go on for. For me, it meant seeing a more relaxed and fun side to my usually quite strict and serious father. It is one of the most enduring memories of my youth – as it probably is for a lot of Caribbean children who grew up in the UK. The fact is, this case is not about wokery or being deliberately antisocial – it is about cultural nuances. Dominoes is not played in Caribbean communities like chess or draughts – it is more like a very rambunctious game of Monopoly. It’s loud, it has energy – it’s a social gathering, as Theophile alluded to when he said he and his friends started playing in the square because “we were kind of lonely”. If they make a bit of noise, they are not the only ones. Football fans have their chants; pubs are noisy places; children playing outside, wrenched away from their screens, make a glorious racket. No one has the right to be deliberately antisocial, but isn’t reasonable accommodation of our different foibles how a diverse society works? Lighten up. Let the old men gather. Let the games begin.",News/UK news,"Dominoes cannot be played quietly, as any child of Caribbean origin knows",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/dominoes-cannot-be-played-quietly-as-any-child-of-caribbean-origin-knows
5/7/2022,"A Thursday afternoon at Maida Hill market square is filled with pensioners happily chatting and playing cards while enjoying the sunshine. However, over the past year the square has been at the centre of an ongoing row between some of its regulars and Westminster council. Last year, Ernest Theophile, a 73-year-old black man who regularly plays dominoes with other locals in the area, was summoned to court by the council and accused of being too noisy and causing a disturbance. This resulted in the council initially being granted a special injunction that banned social gatherings. Although the injunction was overturned shortly afterwards, Theophile and his friends could still face jail if they breach a court order by “playing loud amplified music, drinking alcohol and shouting and swearing”. “The square is very important to me. I come here virtually seven days a week,” said Theophile. “I’ve grown up there all my life so I don’t know any other. To me, it’s like home away from home.” For Theophile, the square is a haven for older people, mainly from a West Indian and minority ethnic background, to find company and spend time with likeminded folk. According to Theophile, they do not engage in antisocial behaviour such as drinking, shouting or swearing. Rather the main purpose of their gatherings is to play dominoes with one another, a culturally significant pastime in the West Indian community. “The loneliness was one of the biggest factors as to why we gathered there. That’s why the square was ideal for us,” Theophile said. “Sometimes the younger generation come here and congregate, but we just want a place where we can socialise and play a few games to pass the time.” Theophile’s barrister has argued that the court order, which threatened jail sentences, is “likely to be indirectly discriminatory”. “An injunction restraining the activities of a minority of black people in a public square where there is a theoretical power of arrest and sanction of imprisonment is indirectly discriminatory,” Tim James-Matthews told Central London county court. Theophile believes that being taken to court was “absolutely racially motivated”. He said: “It’s because it’s mainly groups of ethnic minorities who come here, and that’s the reason why I think they wanted us out.” Although Westminster council have claimed that they have offered a free space where dominoes could be played, this is something which has been denied by Theophile and other locals. Tony Edwards, who is in his 60s and has been living in the area for more than half a century, agrees the square is simply a place where many people from the West Indian community come to “mingle and socialise”. “I go to work, and when I finish work, I come back here to socialise,” he said. “I’m here all the time, seven days a week.” He added: “All we do here is play a little cards, a little dominoes. That’s all we do, we don’t trouble anybody. We’re peaceful, we’re a family.” Others say the fact that many pensioners use the square as a social hub is a result of a lack of community spaces in the area. “We have no where else to go and gather,” said Ashworth, a retired security officer who regularly visits the square. “We only really have this place here, where we can sit outside and play a little dominoes, or a little backgammon too. We’ve been to the council so many times to ask them to give us a place, but we still only have this square.” “The square is used by many different people because there’s nothing here for anybody,” said Jacqui Haynes, a community organiser based in Maida Hill. Haynes, who runs a food bank based in St Peter’s Church in Maida Hill, says she and other local people have regularly approached Westminster city council about the lack of social and community spaces in the area. “There are a lot of older people who go to the square not because they necessarily want to, but who go there because there’s nowhere else,” Haynes said. “I’ve been battling with the council to provide social activities so that the people that don’t want to be there necessarily won’t have to. But people go there because there’s nowhere else.” A Westminster council spokesperson said: “Claims that Westminster city council has banned anyone in the square from playing dominos and backgammon are untrue. “The order applies to amplified noise and assorted antisocial and illegal activities, such as urinating and drug dealing, that the local community has seen taking place in and around the local area. “Since the introduction of the court order this public realm has held a number of family-friendly community events, that had previously not been able to take place.”",News/UK news,West Indian dominoes players dismayed by noise ban in London square,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/west-indian-dominoes-players-dismayed-noise-ban-london-square
5/7/2022,"The Holocaust novel is a relatively recent phenomenon. For decades, fiction maintained a respectful silence, deferring to the testimony of survivors. Even those survivors tended towards circumspection, with Primo Levi warning that such memoirs as his own should be read “with a critical eye”; that the Holocaust could not be wholly apprehended even by those who had endured it. The present generation of novelists has proved less reticent and, in many cases, less punctilious. If bestselling fiction can, God help us, “raise awareness”, it can just as easily numb the senses. In a spate of popular titles, Auschwitz has been made the site of cosily redemptive parables, the historical frame cropped to Instagram dimensions. Shortlisted for the Dublin literary award and longlisted for the Women’s prize, Catherine Chidgey’s novel is attended by higher expectations. It is certainly a work of serious intent, distinguished not just by its scrupulous scholarship but by its carefully calibrated ambitions. Chidgey is a writer of formidable resources, a deft stylist possessed of uncanny imaginative acuity, but here she seems determined to keep those gifts in check, or to exercise them only within carefully circumscribed limits. These self-imposed strictures extend to the novel’s very form. The narratives of its three principal characters each adopt an archival guise: Lenard Weber, a Munich physician, writes letters to his daughter; SS officer Dietrich Hahn gives taped interviews; Greta Hahn, his wife, speaks to us through what is termed an “imaginary diary”, as if to advertise where greater artistic liberties may be taken. More fundamentally, these narratives are constrained almost from the outset in their possible outcomes. In part, this is a function of historical irony. When Greta’s diary entries begin, in February 1943, her household is decamping to a villa at Buchenwald, where Dietrich is proudly taking up a post. Assuaging her anxieties about the move, he assures her that they will be provided with every comfort, including “excellent servants”. We know, of course, how these comforts and servants will be supplied. We know, too, how Hahn’s illustrious career will end: his transcribed interviews begin in October 1954, meaning that he has been tried by the Americans and escaped execution. Weber’s story is similarly preordained. In 1942, he is employed at Munich’s Holy Spirit Hospital, treating cancer patients with an electrical device of his own invention – it is this device, based on the principle of “remote sympathy”, that provides the novel’s many layered title. Already, though, his superiors are quizzing him on his ancestry and urging him to divorce his Jewish wife. Again, his fate is doubly assured, since these recollections appear in a letter from 1946: he is bound for the camp but will be spared its crematorium. Clearly, these choices are considered. By depriving herself of conventional sources of tension, Chidgey can keep faith with her subject. The horrors of the Holocaust were inescapable and must remain so. To imbue them with tricksy suspense would be false, even indecent. But no novel can dispense with artifice entirely, and from the start we see other tensions at work: between proximity and distance, seeing and believing, knowing and refusing to know. In his interviews, Dietrich insists that he was “merely in supplies”. He boasts that his careful budgeting allowed every prisoner to receive “precisely the amount of food required”. He could tell, he explains, from a chart in the camp kitchens showing “little red tabs that indicated every ten deaths”. Installed at the villa, Greta evinces shock on discovering that her domestic servant is a prisoner, but soon she is ordering luxurious new drapes from the camp. When the prisoners deliver them, one of them catches sight of his own reflection: “[He] stopped dead for a moment, his mouth an open hole.” The image, like so many here, is lucid but not lurid. It stops us dead, too. When Greta is diagnosed with cancer, the three characters are brought into conjunction. Hearing of Weber’s “miracle machine”, Dietrich offers him inducements to treat Greta: news of his wife and child; lighter duties that might keep him alive. As their lives and fates intersect, so too do their lies and self-deceits. Dietrich must conceal their arrangement; Greta must feign ignorance of her new doctor’s circumstances; Weber must offer hope for her survival, now inextricable from his own. Chidgey manages this contrivance with great care, both for its historical fidelity and the nature of its effects. Indeed, the same can be said for the book as a whole. Its aim is not to elicit sentiment, but to enlist witnesses. And as witnesses, we find ourselves unreliable, noticing the unsteadiness of our own gaze and the lapses of our own remote sympathy.
