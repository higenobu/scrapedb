3/8/2022,"Police officers should work under a licence that must be renewed every five years and be subject to strict conditions to boost confidence in policing, an independent review has recommended. The Strategic Review of Policing in England and Wales, chaired by Sir Michael Barber and carried out by the Police Foundation thinktank, contains 56 recommendations urging radical reform to police culture, skills and training, and organisational structure. Police chiefs said the report was “thorough and thought-provoking”. The report comes at a time when confidence in policing has been rocked by a series of scandals, predominantly within the Metropolitan police, including the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer and revelations that officers at Charing Cross station shared racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic messages. Barber, a former adviser to Tony Blair and an expert on implementation of large-scale systems change, said: “There is a crisis of confidence in policing in this country which is corroding public trust. “The reasons are deep-rooted and complex – some cultural and others systemic. However, taken together, unless there is urgent change, they will end up destroying the principle of policing by consent that has been at the heart of British policing for decades. “Policing in this country is at a crossroads and it cannot stand still while the world changes so quickly around it. Now is the moment to move forward quickly on the path of reform. The warning signs if we do nothing are flashing red and we ignore them at our peril. “This report represents the most comprehensive review of policing for a generation and sets out an agenda for fundamental change.” Among the recommendations in the report are calls for a “licence to practice” for police officers, administered by the College of Policing, the professional standards body. The licence should be renewed every five years, subject to an officer demonstrating professional development through achieving relevant qualifications, passing an interview, or presenting a portfolio of activities and achievements, the report said. Any officer who fails this assessment could receive further support including mentoring, but successive failures would see their licence removed and they would no longer be able to work, the report adds. Barber also calls for improved training and support for sergeants and inspectors so that they are equipped to provide stronger supervision, tackle poor conduct and call out bad behaviour among officers. There should also be national targets to improve the diversity of the police workforce, Barber says, arguing that at the current pace of change it will take another 58 years for the police service to achieve a workforce that is representative of England and Wales in terms of ethnicity. Among other recommendations are the creation of a new Crime Prevention Agency and the merger of back-office functions across the 43 forces of England and Wales, which Barber argues would save hundreds of millions of pounds. Investment in frontline policing is also on the list, as is training and technology to modernise the service from top to bottom. The chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Martin Hewitt, said: “The emphasis on confidence aligns with a collective recognition across policing for us to rebuild any trust that has been lost. We acknowledge the presentation of wide-ranging factors that may have contributed to that position, and of the differing priorities and resource requirements for policing in society today. “Investing in the future of the service, with a focus on delivering improved outcomes for victims and strengthening local policing, are priorities for every force. “We are already hard at work with other law enforcement agencies, external partners and government to better understand the current landscape and ensure we do not further become the service of first resort on matters which are either not crime-related or could be prevented in the first place.”",News/UK news,Police officers should work under ‘licence’ to restore trust – report for England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/police-officers-should-work-under-licence-to-restore-trust-report-for-england-and-wales
3/8/2022,"Labour will spring a snap vote on cancelling the increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) on Tuesday, warning it will cost the average private sector worker £410 a year, as the opposition tries to exploit Tory divisions. In new analysis of sluggish wages and the national insurance rise, planned for April, Labour said private sector employees would face a “double whammy”, with employers also passing on the cost of their increased NICs. The rise, billed as a health and social care levy, was designed to raise £12bn to tackle the post-Covid NHS backlog, as well as funding a longer-term overhaul of social care. Critics including the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation have said the rise, set in legislation in the autumn, is disproportionately loaded on to younger and lower-paid workers compared with a rise in income tax. The vote at Labour’s opposition day debate on Tuesday is intended to expose growing Tory unease over the cost of living crisis, exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Among those who have called for the NICs rise to be delayed are the Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory chair of the Treasury select committee, Mel Stride, the foreign affairs select committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, and the former Europe minister David Frost. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the UK had been “left exposed to soaring costs and spiralling inflation because of choices the Conservatives have made, and now they’re going to make the cost of living crisis worse, hitting workers with a double whammy from an unfair, terribly timed tax rise”. She added: “The Conservatives are trapping us in a high-tax, low-growth cycle. They must get behind Labour’s motion tomorrow and halt this tax rise before it’s too late. And they must look again at Labour’s proposal for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut household energy bills by up to £600.” The draft motion from Labour calls on the government to cancel the planned rise of 1.25 percentage points. Labour’s analysis is based on the conclusions of the Office for Budget Responsibility which found that, in addition to the NICs rise directly levied on employees, 80% of the equivalent increase in employers’ contributions would be “passed through to workers via lower nominal wages”. Tory MPs have been privately making the case to the Treasury that the economic circumstances that shaped the NICs rise announced last summer have fundamentally changed, including a bigger than expected increase in energy prices and significant inflation. In January, Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson wrote a joint article vowing to press ahead with the rise, a sign in part that the chancellor feared the prime minister could bend to the demands of Tory MPs while his premiership was under threat over Downing Street lockdown breaches. No 10 has said there are “no plans” to delay the rise. The Treasury has been contacted for comment. A HM Treasury spokesperson said: “The chancellor has been clear he believe in lower taxes. But we took the tough but responsible decision to introduce the levy that will provide a necessary, permanent source of funding to support the NHS and fix the social care system.“The levy is fair, with those earning more paying more – and it’s right that employers, who benefit from a healthy workforce, contribute so the costs are more widely shared. “We’re providing around £21bn this financial year to help families with the cost of living, including a rise in the National Living Wage, meaning that people working full-time will see a £1,000 increase in annual earnings.” ",News/Politics,Labour to test Tories with snap vote on national insurance rise ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/07/labour-to-test-tories-with-snap-vote-on-national-insurance-rise
