4/27/2022,"Elon Musk and Twitter confirmed Monday that the billionaire was buying the company for $44 billion. The announcement set social media ablaze, prompting reactions from investors and companies. Binance, Mark Cuban, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Winklevoss twins all weighed in. Monday brought the blockbuster news that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was buying Twitter. The megadeal prompted famous investors, companies, and executives to weigh in — on the very social platform that Musk just bought. Cameron Winklevoss, an investor, said that ""in retrospect, it was inevitable"" Musk would buy the social-media platform. Winklevoss, who along with his twin brother famously sued Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, previously tweeted his support for Musk's free-speech proposal, saying ""good riddance to the censors"" and other moderation features that some critics have said are unfair. He also asked whether Musk would be ""consummating the Twitter purchase in dogecoin,"" a meme coin that Musk has often thrust his support behind. Tyler Winklevoss, his brother, also tweeted his support for the social-media giant's new owner. ""Congratulations,"" he said. ""A great day for free speech."" Sriram Krishnan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz focusing on Web3 technologies, called this a ""new era"" for the company. ""Thrilled for @twitter. Congratulations to @elonmusk and think this will be a fantastic moment for what is a service we all care about,"" Krishnan tweeted. His boss Marc Andreessen later tweeted ""new current thing just dropped,"" with a black Twitter bird logo. —Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) April 25, 2022 He also tweeted a meme based on ""The Office."" —Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) April 25, 2022 The billionaire investor Mark Cuban tweeted Monday he was ""very surprised"" by news of the sale, adding that Musk ""is on the clock."" He had posited last week that Musk's bid for the company could have merely been a ploy to drive up Twitter's stock value. —Mark Cuban (@mcuban) April 25, 2022 The blockchain giant Binance asked its 8.4 million Twitter followers what their thoughts were on the sale. The company also tweeted, ""Let's get rid of the spambots on day one please."" Twitter users have long complained of the automated troll accounts, which Musk said in Monday's press release he wanted to defeat. But not everyone was as thrilled or optimistic. The ACLU said Musk was one of its biggest benefactors but worried about any singular, powerful actor that could affect such a ""critical tool"" as social media. The NAACP, meanwhile, urged Musk not to allow former President Donald Trump back onto the platform. State governors weighed in, too. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas encouraged Musk to move Twitter to their respective states, just like he moved Tesla to Texas. Abbott tweeted: "".@elonmusk. Bring Twitter to Texas to join Tesla, SpaceX & the Boring company.""

4/27/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia already has a weakened military and is a weakened state after its war on neighboring Ukraine, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Tuesday before a meeting of NATO allies and partners. ""They are a weaker military. They are a weaker state right now they are and again further isolating themselves,"" Kirby said in an interview with CNN. ""We want Russia not to be able to threaten their neighbors again in the future."" ""Its economy is in tatters. Its military has been depleted in many ways, not completely, but certainly they have suffered casualties and they have suffered losses in this invasion of Ukraine,"" he said. Kirby did not give further details on his assessment of the state of Russia's military.

4/27/2022,"Russia is making good on promises to attack U.S. and allied weapons shipment points and fuel depots in Ukraine, launching rockets at five railway facilities used to funnel critical supplies into the country on Monday. The attacks across western and central Ukraine targeting supply lines and infrastructure come as billions worth of heavy artillery systems, tanks and armored vehicles begin arriving to help Ukraine face off against what is expected to be a full-scale Russian assault in Donbas. On Monday, the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense huddled with top Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, where they pledged hundreds of millions more in military aid for the coming fight. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters in Poland Monday. “It had already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.”
 Over the past two weeks, the Pentagon has picked up the pace of its deliveries to the battlefield, rushing in more than $1 billion worth of heavy weaponry and other aid by sea and by air. On Thursday, President Joe Biden approved another $800 million weapons package, including 72 155mm howitzers. By Saturday, those howitzers were already showing up in the country, Austin said Monday. “That is unimaginable speed,” he said. Since August 2021, DoD has given Ukraine enough artillery to equip five battalions for potential use in the Donbas, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said last week. The U.S. military has also begun training several dozen Ukrainian fighters on the new equipment outside of Ukraine, he said. But in this new phase of the conflict, protecting critical supply lines will be key, experts and former officials say. “The fight for Donbas will be won or lost primarily on logistics: weapons, equipment and ammunition,” said Mick Mulroy, a former top Pentagon official and retired CIA paramilitary officer and Marine. “There have to be uninterrupted supply lines from the U.S. and NATO.” Those supply lines have been threatened by Russia since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, but until now Moscow hasn’t explicitly acknowledged it acted on these warnings. Both Russia and Ukraine are rushing to marshal resources and materiel in the Donbas region in Ukraine’s east, and western officials are pushing their governments to provide additional aid to Kyiv for the coming fight. Ukraine is taking in “a lot of new Western new equipment, maybe more than the Russians have been capable of moving into the country themselves, so the imbalance in equipment that we saw in the early phases of the war is starting to equalize,” said Dmitry Gorenburg, a Russia specialist at nonprofit research institute CNA. But moving tanks and large artillery pieces over the Polish border without attracting Russian attention is more complex than moving truckloads of smaller Javelin and Stinger missiles, which dominated the donations in the early days of the war. Striking those new, larger shipments, if they come by both rail and road, could prove difficult for Russia over the long run, however. Russia’s pilots remain wary of testing Ukraine’s air defenses and the Kremlin will likely need to start conserving some of its long-range precision weapons. “[Russia’s] stockpiles aren't necessarily large” when it comes to weapons such as Kalibr and Iskander precision missiles, Gorenburg said. “They are using them up, and they don't want to use them all because that would weaken their ability to fight NATO” in the near future. And so far, Russia has not been effective at disrupting the supply lines, primarily because its military is “not very good at dynamic targeting” — in other words, hitting a moving object rather than a stationary target such as a building, Mulroy said. The fighting in the coming days and weeks will likely be different from the small-unit clashes seen in the opening weeks of the war, when Ukrainian anti-armor munitions blunted Russian attacks around the capital of Kyiv in close-in urban fighting. The war in Donbas has already seen longer-range artillery engagements, and the 90 howitzers supplied by the U.S., alongside newly arrived Canadian howitzers and French Caesar mobile 155mm cannon systems on the way will give Ukrainian forces the ability to match — if not outdistance — Russia’s long-range capabilities. Adding to the inflow of armor, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki confirmed Monday that his country had sent T-72 tanks to Ukraine, following the lead of the Czech Republic, which has sent its own Soviet-era tanks in recent weeks. While the Russian long-range strikes into western Ukraine are expanding the zone of conflict, Ukrainian helicopters last month also conducted a risky operation into Russia, targeting an oil depot over the border in Belgorod. On Sunday night, several explosions rocked two oil facilities, one commercial and one military, in the Russian city of Bryansk close to the Ukrainian border. Those explosions came after a string of unexplained fires at Russian military research facilities over the past week. As the fight for Donbas gathers strength, British intelligence assesses that Russia has made minor advances in Ukraine’s east in recent days, and “without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough” U.K. defense attaché Mick Smeath said in a statement Monday. Britain will also send Ukraine a small number of Stormer armored vehicles fitted with launchers for anti-air missiles, defense chief Ben Wallace announced Monday. This is in addition to a shipment of Challenger 2 tanks that Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Friday. Since the conflict began, Russia has lost about 15,000 personnel, over 2,000 armored vehicles, and more than 60 helicopters and fighter jets, according to U.K. Ministry of Defence estimates, Wallace said. Over 25 percent of the battalion tactical groups Russian committed to the fight have been “rendered not combat effective,” he added. “Russia has so far failed in nearly every one of its objectives,” Wallace said. “These next three weeks are key.”",World/Politico,Russia targeting Western weapons shipments in Ukraine as Donbas assault begins,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-targeting-western-weapons-shipments-000558366.html
