1/2/2022,"It’s a new year and many of us are looking for a fresh start after a very difficult 2021. We’ve asked a group of experts for their advice on how to tackle some of the most common personal finance dilemmas.  Damien Fahy, founder of personal finance site Money to the Masses The key to spending less is having a budget – if you can quantify it, you can control it. Luckily, there are lots of resources to help work out a monthly budget, including budgeting and banking apps. I’d recommend Money Dashboard and Emma. Try using the “three-day rule” to curb frivolous spending – if you want something, wait three days before buying it to see if you genuinely want or need it, rather than it being a momentary impulse. You can also introduce zero-spend days into your week, aiming to have 24 hours without additional spending, over and above essentials, such as food and bills. Sara Williams, founder of the Debt Camel advice blog Overdrafts are a hard type of debt to clear, as your balance keeps changing through the month. But they are also very expensive, so are a priority to tackle. You can be very disciplined, and aim to cut your overdraft usage each month. Many people find it is more practical to change to a new current account with no overdraft and move all of their banking over. That way you can pay off the old overdraft by setting up a standing order from your new account. If you have been continuously in your overdraft for a long while, never getting back into the black, you should also look at making a claim for unaffordable lending. This would be based on whether the bank “completed reasonable and proportionate checks” that you could repay in a sustainable way. Details at the Financial Ombudsman Service website. Steve Webb, partner at LCP and former pensions minister If you earn more than £10,000, your employer should put you in a workplace pension and make a contribution, so simply not opting out is a great start. Next, review your pension contribution each time you get a pay increase, as it’s less painful to commit a bit more before you’ve got used to the extra income. Also, find out if your employer will do more, if you do more. Many bigger firms will match the money you put in (up to a limit). Make the most of this “free money”. Finally, it’s never too late to start. You get good tax breaks for saving in a pension, plus money from your employer, so even building up a small pot is worthwhile. Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of Zap-Map, which gives information on charging and electric vehicles One of the best routes to getting a good value electric vehicle (EV) is via a salary sacrifice scheme. Another flexible option is to subscribe to a short-term, all-inclusive service such as Onto, which includes insurance, charging and tax, among other expenses. There are also more secondhand EVs available to buy – try out one of the specialist companies, such as Weareev or Drive Green. Once you have secured your electric vehicle, your next step is to get a charge point installed at your home and sign up to an EV energy tariff with discounts for off-peak charging when available, given current energy tariff issues. With this, costs can be as low as 2-3p/mile – even less if you can link it to solar panels. Alternatively, you can check out community charging via Co-Charger, or take a look at the close to 30,000 public charge points on Zap-Map, about 5,000 of which are still free to use. Laura McGadie, group head of energy, Energy Saving Trust There are a series of simple and straightforward things you can do that will save you money without compromising your health or lifestyle. Firstly, turn off devices that are on standby and turn off lights when you leave the room. Be sure to draught-proof around windows, doors, floorboards and skirting boards and insulate hot water cylinders with an 80mm British Standard jacket. In the kitchen, fit an aerator to the tap – it reduces the amount of water flowing – and only boil water you need in the kettle. Reduce the number of washing machine loads you run by one a week, and ensure they are always full. Wash clothes at 30 degrees. Avoid using a tumble dryer – dry clothes outside where possible, or inside with ventilation. Limit shower times to four minutes and swap a weekly bath for a shower. Take all of these steps and you could save up to £248 a year. Laura Brown, editor, Save the Student It’s worth familiarising yourself with the student finance system and, if possible, saving up some money to help them get by. Research has found that, on average, students receive £120.56 a month from parents. But one in eight feels their parents don’t give enough financial support. As maintenance loans are generally calculated on household income, you might find the government actually expects you to contribute, offering a smaller loan as a result. We have a parental contributions calculator that helps you work out how much this could be. Saving to financially support your child, as well as sharing your best money-management tips, could make a huge difference. Sian Conway-Wood, author of Buy Better, Consume Less The first thing is to not do something – and that is waste food. Households account for 70% of food waste in the UK, and the majority of food thrown away would have been edible. The cost of that adds up to £284 a person each year. Plan ahead, buy what you need and take steps to avoid waste. All of these steps are the first moves towards sustainable eating and can save you money as a result. Potatoes, bread and fresh fruit and vegetables are some of the most wasted foods. We’re often encouraged to buy in bulk, but they can be purchased in smaller quantities. Pay attention to how much you actually use and reduce the amount you buy. Jason Costain, head of fraud prevention at NatWest When buying goods, only use sellers or shops that accept card payments. Be suspicious when answering calls, texts and emails. There will always be the latest ingenious scam, so any time you give someone your address, email, or date of birth, stop and think. Do I trust them and what do they need it for? A lot of victims are the target of sophisticated scammers days after they’ve innocently given away basic information. Charles Cotton, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development Do your homework by checking what the going rate is for similar jobs, such as through a salary comparison website like Glassdoor. If you’re already being paid the average salary, or higher, it could prove harder to justify an increase, so you may want to go for a promotion, instead. If you’re not, make sure you make this point when putting forward your case. Strengthen it further by giving examples of why you deserve a pay rise – perhaps you met all your annual objectives, or you’ve excelled on a particular project. While it makes sense to talk to your manager first, they will most likely not be able to authorise a pay rise. Make their job easier by writing down your reasons, which they can share with their colleagues.",Lifestyle/Money,If you’ve resolved to improve your finances for the new year …,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/02/if-youve-resolved-to-improve-your-finances-for-the-new-year-
1/2/2022,"In one of Mary Gaitskill’s best short stories, The Agonized Face, a female journalist watches a “feminist author” read at a literary festival. The author begins by complaining about her biographical note in the festival brochure, which, she feels, has played up her past experiences with prostitution and psychiatric wards to make her seem like “a kooky person off somewhere doing unimaginable stuff”. But just after she has persuaded the audience of the unfairness of such a portrayal, the author reads a funny story aloud from her book, which leaves the journalist unimpressed. The story – about an encounter between a man and an older woman – is flimsy and provocative, where the complaint had been tender and serious. “She sprouted three heads,” the journalist writes, “and asked that we accept them all!” The feminist had evaded something important, according to the journalist, by changing gears so abruptly: “the story she read made what had seemed like dignity look silly and obscene.” Gaitskill’s characters are often unjustly perceived as kooky people doing unimaginable stuff, but her stories are neither silly nor obscene. In Secretary – later made into a treacly film starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader – you can never quite tell how Debby feels about being abused and spanked by her male boss. Unlike in the movie, there is no blossoming relationship between boss and secretary, but might Debby be looking for dignity in the routine humiliation? In Oppositions, a new collection of Gaitskill’s essays, she asserts that the tragedy of the story is not so much that Debby is a victim, but that a “hunger for contact underlies her perversity and to some extent drives it”. It is a wordless yearning that contemporary feminist discourse now and again skips over in its quest to invert the male gaze and normalise female desire. And yet, as the journalist in The Agonized Face suggests, “sometimes you wish it could be that easy”.  Gaitskill skips over nothing on the page. Her sentences are leavened by a novelist’s spirited discontent with mere facts, a distrust of transparent surfaces. Recounting an incident when she was sexually assaulted at 16, she wonders why she had described it for a while as “rape”. She’d lied “not for revenge but in service of… the metaphorical truth – although what that truth was is not at all clear to me”. In a piece on Lolita, where she is withering about the “haters” who conflate art and life, Gaitskill is moved by Nabokov’s bizarre claim that he was inspired by a newspaper article about a chimpanzee in a zoo that drew with charcoal the bars of its cage. “For those of us for whom metaphors are a natural way of seeing,” Gaitskill writes, “it makes instant, terrible sense.” The remaining essays – on music, films, the Bible, American sex scandals – together make up a shadow autobiography. We learn, from a piece on the Book of Revelation, that Gaitskill ran away from home in her teens, and that at 21 she was briefly a born-again Christian. A trip to Russia becomes an occasion to recall the time she worked at a strip joint in Canada. Listening to Talking Heads, she realises how their music was always playing somewhere in the background, and in her head, when she was starting to write in her 20s. A song by B-Movie conjures up memories of a thwarted romance from the 80s. About music, Gaitskill declares at one point that “she is not a fan by nature”, but her longueurs on bands and songs have a certain underhand charm. Fans of her fiction will relish the impossibly cool image of a younger Gaitskill typing out her early stories with the headphones on every morning. With Gaitskill, you scarcely get or sometimes even expect popular opinions, regardless of whether she is riffing on Chekhov or the Clintons. She is seldom persuaded by groupthink, be it the “psychological uniformity of experience” that she decries in both “rape-crisis” American feminists and their critics in the mid-90s, or years later, the “hive-mind” that she feels is at work in the bestselling novel Gone Girl: “There is nothing here but ‘that guy’ or ‘that girl’, and that means nothing, period.” She defends John Updike’s right to be narcissistic, Norman Mailer’s impulse to be a “kook”. I can’t imagine another writer today, in this age of lucrative film rights and airtight confidentiality agreements, even mildly disapproving of a movie based on one of their stories. Gaitskill is gloriously trenchant, but never gimmicky, in these unsparing essays. Oppositions: Selected Essays by Mary Gaitskill is published by Profile (£16.99).

1/2/2022,"Underneath the shadow of the snow-topped Austrian Alps, in front of a forest of thick green trees and behind a pure azure lake, sits a sprawling chalet that has seen everyone from Kate Moss to Michael Gove pass through its wide glass doors. The VivaMayr health resort in Altaussee, Austria, has long been the picturesque home of celebrity detoxes – strict bans on caffeine and alcohol, combined with stricter rules about the number of times you need to chew your food (40, naturally) have helped numerous celebrity clientele lose weight. The detoxing might sound harsh, but tranquillity oozes through the resort’s Instagram page, where enchanting mists tickle thick evergreen trees and women pose with mugs in sleek, pine interiors. It’s not the image that comes to mind when you think “long-Covid clinic”, but it is one. For £2,700 a week (excluding accommodation), sufferers can attend VivaMayr’s post-Covid medical programme, which promises a “better quality of life”. There is currently no cure for long Covid – the condition in which individuals continue to suffer Covid-19 symptoms for months after first being infected – but there are plenty of treatments. There is an entire network of specialist NHS long-Covid clinics across the United Kingdom – here, patients can undergo rehabilitative programmes to help them improve their stamina, breathing and cognitive functions (for many, long Covid is characterised by fatigue, breathlessness, and concentration problems). Yet in September, the Office for National Statistics estimated that 1.1 million people in the UK currently suffer with long Covid, while between July and August, only 5,737 people were referred to specialist NHS clinics. With the Omicron variant threatening more lives, there’s a gap in the market for long-Covid care, and plenty of private practitioners are happy to fill it – for a price.  Gwyneth Paltrow was one of the first. In February 2021, the actor and businesswoman wrote a blogpost on her lifestyle website, Goop, detailing her post-Covid regime, which included fasting and “doing an infrared sauna as often as I can”. Paltrow’s post helpfully listed the numerous products she’d used to get a handle on her “long-tail fatigue and brain fog”: £112 Goopbrand vitamin C serum, a nearly-£400 sauna blanket, and a single £105 drinking glass (purchasable from the Goop site) via which long-Covid sufferers can sip non-alcoholic gin (also helpfully linked). The National Medical Director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, warned against Paltrow’s advice, saying, “Some of the solutions she’s recommending are really not the solutions we’d recommend in the NHS. We need to take long Covid seriously and apply serious science.” But Paltrow is far from the only person who can be accused of commercialising and commodifying long-Covid treatments. Over the course of the past year, numerous long-Covid wellness retreats have sprung up across the globe, offering treatments for breath-taking prices. In ascending order of eye watering, there’s: the Park Igls Fit After Covid “therapeutic module” in Austria for £3,000 a week; the RAKxa long Covid programme in Thailand at £2,893 for three nights; and the Arrigo Long Covid Healing Programme in Somerset, £2,500 a day (minimum seven-day stay). Then there’s VivaMayr, where patients can exercise in the Alpine air, jump into the icy lake and have frequent massages to help them relieve their symptoms. All four of the above programmes involve qualified medical professionals, diagnostic tests and tailored diets alongside wellness practices, such as yoga, mud baths, “aquagymnastics” and acupuncture. Although there are some unorthodox treatments on offer – Park Igls promises patients “three liver compresses with beeswax”, while RAKxa patients undergo Ya-Pao therapy, in which a paste is applied to their chest and set on fire – these complement traditional medicine. Brendan Delaney is a professor of medicine at Imperial College London who, alongside 30 other doctors, spent six months putting together a set of recommendations for recognising and managing long Covid; it was published in the British Journal of General Practice in November. Delaney personally isn’t too concerned about the types of treatments on offer to patients at long-Covid retreats. “They’re getting the medical input and then they’re getting the rehab type input via some form of wellness activity,” Delaney says. “If they happen to be able to afford to have that in a trip to the Austrian Alps, well that’s a wonderful place to have your rehab.” The problem, of course, is that the vast majority of long-Covid sufferers can’t afford it. “The idea that long Covid patients are the Knightsbridge worried-well that can ship off and do these kind of wellness things is completely erroneous. The biggest groups [of sufferers] are healthcare workers and teachers, followed by care home staff, because they’ve had the biggest exposure to Covid early on, and possibly quite large viral loads,” says Delaney, who himself has had long Covid for almost two years. Although most sufferers can’t afford bespoke multi-thousand pound retreats, Delaney says that many do seek private help, be it “packages of online wellness treatment for a few hundred pounds” or hyperbaric oxygen therapy, a treatment where patients breathe pure oxygen at high pressures to help oxygenate their tissues and promote healing. “If you’re in a situation where you are unable to work, you feel awful, and you can’t carry out your family and your social obligations, then you’re going to try and find any way you can to try and improve the situation you’re in,” Delaney says, noting that it’s “not unusual” for NHS long-Covid clinics to have up to “10-month” waiting lists. According to the most recent NHS England data, more than a third of people referred to post-Covid assessment centres in England have to wait “15+ weeks” to be seen, while in the southwest of England specifically, 49% of patients have to wait this long. In this environment, increasingly desperate patients are willing to spend a fortune on private tests and treatments, as well as vitamins, supplements, IV drips, herbs and alternative medicines that they hope will provide relief. The issue is exacerbated because many patients can’t even get referred to NHS long-Covid clinics in the first place – often their symptoms are dismissed as anxiety. “The problem that a lot of patients have is not being taken seriously,” Delaney says, “Because the largest group of patients are women… and there’s a long history in medicine of not taking women’s problems seriously.” (A March 2021 paper in the BMJ found that middle-aged women in particular face a “greater risk of debilitating long-term symptoms” after hospital treatment for Covid-19.) Delaney works one day a week as a GP and has seen this problem first hand. One of his patients was referred to an NHS long-Covid clinic and dismissed as anxious. Delaney brought the patient in and did his own tests, and found that she had tachycardia (a heart rate that was too fast). Delaney was able to prescribe medicine to the woman thanks to his long-Covid expertise, but he knows that many health workers would simply have dismissed her. Patients who can afford elaborate wellness retreats, then, aren’t just getting treatment for their money – they’re also getting access to someone who takes them seriously. A wealth divide exists in long-Covid treatment, which is exacerbated by the fact that being sick in itself is already expensive, with many left unable to work. In the autumn, a small survey of 252 sufferers conducted by campaign group Long Covid Support found that 45% had been unable to return to work, while 5% had been directly dismissed by their employers because of their condition. “People with conditions such as chronic fatigue and possibly long-Covid experience substantial disruption to their lives and support from family and friends is often required,” says Paul McCrone, a professor of health economics at the University of Greenwich who has authored papers on the hidden costs of chronic fatigue. While McCrone says there will always be a demand for private medicine, he adds that one-size-fits-all treatments have historically left many chronic fatigue sufferers seeking paid-for alternatives outside of the NHS. “Effective individualised treatments are needed and this does require large amounts of funding,” McCrone says. “It is essentially a political choice as to how much we spend on healthcare. The line frequently given is that resources are scarce, but that is a relative concept – how scarce are they? We currently spend less than 10% of GDP on health and so there is scope for increases.” In July, the National Institute for Health Research set aside £19.6m for 15 studies on diagnosing and treating long Covid. Yet while there continues to be no consensus on the best treatments, let alone a cure, retreats will continue to attract customers. Although most of the treatments on offer here are unlikely to be damaging, it is entirely possible that someone could spend £10,000 hoping to be cured and come out the other end feeling no better. Writing in the Telegraph in October, journalist and long-Covid sufferer Helen Kirwan-Taylor argued that, “Cynicism goes out of the window when you’re desperate.” She described feeling “radiant” after one retreat, but overdoing it the next day and being “drained” by the time night fell. “Residential clinics speed up the healing process, but unless you maintain the benefits with the right diet and regular treatments at home, the symptoms come flooding back,” she concluded. Dr Peter Gartner is the head physician at the Park Igls retreat in Austria. He says its Fit After Covid programme was developed in autumn 2020, by adding “a few treatments and a few diagnostic tools” to the resort’s standard Mayr medicine package, which emphasises the gut’s role in wellbeing. Gartner says Park Igls patients undergo a “chewing bootcamp” where they learn to chew thoroughly and are also treated with detoxes, including the beeswax compress. He adds that Park Iglis’s experts kept up to date with long-Covid research in order to offer the best diagnostic tools as part of the new package, including a spirometry test to measure lung function. He says the retreat sees “a few” long-Covid patients per week. “There are no side-effects and this is a programme everybody can do,” Gartner says when asked if he’s concerned that because so little is known about long Covid, the treatments on offer could potentially make people feel worse. Gartner says sufferers with “severe problems” should undergo intensive rehab with 24-hour monitoring and see specialists and virologists – he says these specialist medical houses are common in Austria. “Our offer is just: what can we do afterwards?” Gartner says, “It’s just a missing link between the rehabs and normal life.” Fiona Arrigo, founder of wellness retreat company the Arrigo Programme, says her Somerset-based long-Covid retreat was “created in response to the strong demand of those struggling with the insidious after-effects of Covid-19” – she says staff receive “daily enquiries” from potential patients. Arrigo says the programme gives sufferers time to process the “shock, trauma, exhaustion, depletion” of long Covid and the bespoke treatment plan helps people recuperate. This, she says, is also why the retreat is expensive: “It is this price because of the exceptionally high level of expertise, the access our clients get to the different specialists and the in-depth testing it requires and also because the programme is completely bespoke to the individual.” Kirwan-Taylor described staying at a “charming cottage” filled with “mounds of fresh strawberries” and “personalised bathrooms”, with her own little river outside. “On the first night I had acupuncture on a heated bed covered in flower petals, then a bath with magnesium flakes.” Arrigo says the retreat’s long-Covid patients have built confidence, developed deeper breathing patterns, improved their energy levels, and found “deeper understanding and self-compassion on this often challenging and difficult journey.” Still, results aren’t guaranteed and she says staff “talk very clearly to everyone” to “ensure clients coming know what we can realistically offer and what they need.” If Arrigo staff feel they can’t help, they recommend other possible clinics that clients can attend. According to management consulting firm McKinsey, the global wellness market is now worth $1.5tn and it’s constantly growing. Yet while mindfulness and meditation has been shown to help with the stress and anxiety of long Covid, wellness solutions should not replace properly funded medical care. “There is a neoliberal ideology that expects us to take full individual responsibility for our health and well-being – allowing governments to withdraw and defund public services,” says Ronald Purser, a professor of management at San Francisco State University and author of McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality. “Like any other hot commodity, mindfulness has been refashioned to accommodate the needs of the market, obfuscating critical reflection on the systemic causes of our collective malaise and institutional stress.” Purser argues: “Fundamental health inequities must be addressed at a government policy level.” Most of those able to afford luxury long-Covid retreats will see some benefit – rest, relaxation and tailored treatment plans can never be a bad thing. “But none of these things are getting to the root cause of the problem, which is still what we’re trying to find out,” GP Delaney notes, “Is it blood vessel inflammation? Is it an immune problem? Is it a persistent virus? Is it blood clots?” Each new variant, including Omicron, behaves slightly differently and brings new questions. If nothing else, long Covid is the great equaliser – even the richest among us can’t pay their way to the answers.",Global,Covid clinics: hope and high prices on the long road to recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/02/covid-clinics-hope-and-high-prices-on-the-long-road-to-recovery

I’ve mentioned in passing Solkiki’s Elvis bar, £8.50, so named because it’s based on Elvis Presley’s love of banana and peanut butter sandwiches, but I want to, here, stress how terrifically good it is. I’m not a fan of banana-flavoured things, but this and Ottolenghi’s banana jam – which you get when you go to his cafés if you order toasted things and is so so good – convinced me otherwise.

1/2/2022,"There was a distinctive moment, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, that neatly encapsulated the mistakes and confusion of Britain’s early efforts to tackle the disease, says Mark Woolhouse. At a No 10 briefing in March 2020, cabinet minister Michael Gove warned the virus did not discriminate. “Everyone is at risk,” he announced. And nothing could be further from the truth, argues Professor Woolhouse, an expert on infectious diseases at Edinburgh University. “I am afraid Gove’s statement was simply not true,” he says. “In fact, this is a very discriminatory virus. Some people are much more at risk from it than others. People over 75 are an astonishing 10,000 times more at risk than those who are under 15.”  And it was this failure to understand the wide variations in individual responses to Covid-19 that led to Britain’s flawed responses to the disease’s appearance, he argues – errors that included the imposition of a long-lasting, national lockdown. This is a strategy that Woolhouse – one of the country’s leading epidemiologists – describes as morally wrong and highly damaging in his forthcoming book, The Year the World Went Mad: A Scientific Memoir. “We did serious harm to our children and young adults who were robbed of their education, jobs and normal existence, as well as suffering damage to their future prospects, while they were left to inherit a record-breaking mountain of public debt,” he argues. “All this to protect the NHS from a disease that is a far, far greater threat to the elderly, frail and infirm than to the young and healthy. “We were mesmerised by the once-in-a-century scale of the emergency and succeeded only in making a crisis even worse. In short, we panicked. This was an epidemic crying out for a precision public health approach and it got the opposite.” Rather than imposing blanket lockdowns across the nation, the government should have adopted measures designed to make contacts safe, Woolhouse maintains. “You can see from the UK data that people were reducing their contacts with each other as cases rose and before lockdown was imposed. That, coupled with Covid-safe measures, such as masks and testing, would have been sufficient to control spread.” Largely voluntary behaviour change worked in Sweden and it should have been allowed to progress in the UK, argues Woolhouse. Instead, we plumped for an enforced national lockdown, in part because, for the first time in history, we could. Enough business is now done online to allow large parts of society to function fairly well – through video conferences and online shopping. “But it was a lazy solution to a novel coronavirus epidemic, as well as a hugely damaging one,” he adds. However, Woolhouse is at pains to reject the ideas of those who advocated the complete opening up of society, including academics who backed the Barrington Declaration which proposed the Covid-19 virus be allowed to circulate until enough people had been infected to achieve herd immunity. “This would have led to an epidemic far larger than the one we eventually experienced in 2020,” says Woolhouse. “It also lacked a convincing plan for adequately protecting the more vulnerable members of society, the elderly and those who are immuno-compromised.” Instead, the country should have put far more effort into protecting the vulnerable. Well over 30,000 people died of Covid-19 in Britain’s care homes. On average, each home got an extra £250,000 from the government to protect against the virus, he calculates. “Much more should have been spent on providing protection for care homes,” says Woolhouse, who also castigates the government for offering nothing more than a letter telling those shielding elderly parents and other vulnerable individuals in their own homes to take precautions. The nation could have spent several thousand pounds per household on provision of routine testing and in helping to implement Covid-safe measures for those shielding others and that would still have amounted to a small fraction of the £300bn we eventually spent on our pandemic response, he argues. Indeed, Woolhouse is particularly disdainful of the neglect of “shielders”, such as care home workers and informal carers. “These people stood between the vulnerable and the virus but, for most of 2020, they got minimal recognition and received no help.” Britain spent a fortune on suppressing the virus and will still be servicing the debt incurred for generations to come, he adds. “By contrast, we spent almost nothing on protecting the vulnerable in the community. We should and could have invested in both suppression and protection. We effectively chose just one.” And Woolhouse is emphatic that further lockdowns are not the way to deal with future waves of Covid-19. “Lockdowns aren’t a public health policy. They signify a failure of public health policy,” he states. Instead, the country needs, very quickly, not to be surprised by new variants and not to respond each one in an ad hoc fashion. “We should agree a sliding scale of interventions and trigger points for implementing them. With omicron it all feels a bit chaotic. We need better planning and preparation for when the next variant arrives, as it surely will.”",News/World news,"Measures, not lockdowns, are only way to keep Covid at bay says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/britain-got-it-wrong-on-covid-long-lockdown-did-more-harm-than-good-says-scientist
1/2/2022,"After years of delay, and massive cost over-runs, the James Webb space telescope (the JWST) was launched on Christmas Day. It will need to perform complex automated operations now it’s in space. The first and most challenging is happening this week: unfurling a heat shield the size of a tennis court. After this, its 6.5-metre mirror must be assembled from 18 pieces packed within the launching rocket’s nose-cone. There’s much that can go wrong and astronomers will remain anxious for the several months that will elapse before all necessary manoevres and tests are completed.  After the Hubble Space Telescope was launched more than 30 years ago, its mirror turned out to be poorly aligned. But astronauts undertook a “rescue” mission to make adjustments and later made further visits to upgrade the instruments. The stakes are higher for the JWST: it’s vastly more elaborate, but there is no prospect of a repair mission. The Hubble telescope was in a low (and accessible) orbit: in contrast, the JWST’s orbit will be several times further away than the moon – far beyond the reach of astronauts. Some might argue that we therefore need to instigate more ambitious plans for human spaceflight: to enable human assembly of large structures in deep space, to return to the moon, and eventually to reach Mars. But I don’t share this view. Indeed as robotics and miniaturisation improve, the practical and scientific case for human spaceflight weakens. Its prime motive now is simply as an adventure – an ultra-expensive sport that should be left to billionaires and private sponsorship. Space technology has burgeoned – for communication, environmental monitoring, satnav and so forth. We depend on it every day. Unmanned probes to other planets have beamed back pictures of varied and distinctive worlds. And telescopes in space have revolutionised our knowledge of the cosmos. During this century, the whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturised probes, far more advanced than, for instance, Nasa’s wonderful Cassini probe, which spent 13 years exploring Saturn and its moons. This was launched 20 years ago and based on 1990s technology. Think how much better we could do today. Robotic fabricators will assemble vast lightweight structures in space (huge, gossamer-thin mirrors or solar energy collectors, for instance), maybe using raw materials mined from the moon or asteroids. And they could repair spacecraft in orbit far beyond the moon. Robotic and AI techniques are evolving fast. For instance, the Curiosity vehicle sent to Mars a decade ago trundled slowly across a Martian crater; if it encountered a rock, it needed instructions from Earth about how to divert its path. In contrast, Perseverance, which landed on Mars last February, has sufficient intelligence to find its way around obstacles. In another decade, such a probe will have AI sufficient to identify and explore interesting sites and geological formations. Nasa’s programme for human spaceflight, ever since Apollo, has been impeded by public and political pressure into being exceedingly risk-averse. The space shuttle failed twice in 135 launches. Thrill-seekers would willingly accept this 2% level of risk. But the shuttle had, unwisely, been promoted as “safe”. So each failure caused a national trauma and was followed by a hiatus while costly efforts were made (with very limited effect) to reduce the risk. Because of this safety culture, Nasa will confront political obstacles in achieving any grand goal within a feasible budget. But private enterprise ventures – SpaceX, Blue Origin and the rest – bringing a Silicon Valley culture into a domain long dominated by Nasa and a few aerospace conglomerates, can cut costs and tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly funded civilian astronauts. So it’s these ventures, with private funds and sponsorship, which should front manned missions. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low risk. And if that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle. These exploits must be sold as dangerous sports or intrepid exploration. Don’t ever expect mass emigration from Earth. And here I disagree strongly with Elon Musk and with my late colleague Stephen Hawking. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from its problems. We’ve got to solve them here. Coping with climate change is a doddle compared to terraforming Mars. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest. There’s no “Planet B” for ordinary, risk-averse people. Nonetheless, this century courageous thrill-seekers may establish bases independent from the Earth. Musk himself says he wants to die on Mars – but not on impact. Although we may not want to join these space adventurers we should cheer them on. This is why. They’ll be ill-adapted to Martian conditions, so they’ll have a compelling incentive to redesign themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed. These techniques will, one hopes, be restrained on Earth, on prudential and ethical grounds, but settlers on Mars will be beyond the clutches of the regulators. We should wish them good luck in modifying their progeny to adapt to alien environments. This might be the first step towards divergence into a new species. So it’s these spacefaring adventurers, not those of us comfortably adapted to life on Earth, who will spearhead the post-human era, evolving within a few centuries into a new species. (This evolution, proceeding on the timescale of technological advance, is potentially thousands of times faster than Darwinian selection.) Moreover, if they make the transition from flesh and blood to fully inorganic intelligences, they won’t need an atmosphere. And they may prefer zero-g, especially for constructing massive artifacts. So it’s in deep space – not on Earth, nor even on Mars – that non-biological “brains” may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine. The sun will survive 6bn more years before its fuel runs out. And the expanding universe will continue far longer, perhaps for ever. So even if intelligent life had originated only on the Earth, it need not remain a trivial feature of the cosmos: it could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever more complex intelligence spreads through the whole galaxy, via self-reproducing machines, transmitting DNA, instructions for 3D printers or suchlike. Interstellar voyages would hold no terrors for near-immortals. There’s plenty of time ahead. Martin Rees is astronomer royal",Opinion/Opinion,Nasa’s Webb telescope is a joy.

1/2/2022,"In March 2020, live classical music and much of cultural life worldwide came to an abrupt halt overnight. Since then, we have seen the gradual reopening of concert halls in all four nations of the UK, as organisers, orchestras and musicians struggle to recover a loss of income, talent and confidence on an unprecedented scale. As we enter 2022, it’s far from life as usual. Most institutions report that only around 65% of pre-pandemic capacity had been reached before the emergence of the Omicron variant. Undoubtedly, more government intervention is needed if the sector is not to be diminished further. Music is the soundtrack to our lives and classical musicians are major contributors to the UK’s reputation for cultural innovation and excellence.  However, for all of its darkness, the pandemic has allowed us to reimagine what our musical world could look like if we start from scratch. Throughout the crisis, the industry has begun to construct a new narrative shaped to accommodate great artistic expression for everyone. As we rebuild our society and our economy, I’m convinced, more than ever, that participation in music is part of the solution for national recovery. Participating in musical activity sustains us through the most perplexing and difficult moments of our lives. I have been hugely inspired by the remarkable and uplifting endorsements of the role of music within our wider community and for people of all ages and backgrounds. I have seen what music does for those living with dementia through Wigmore Hall’s pioneering Music For Life and Singing with Friends programmes. We also reach some of the most marginalised people in society, including those who have experienced homelessness, domestic abuse and children living with HIV, a forgotten minority. English National Opera’s Breathe, another example, draws on the expertise of opera singers and colleagues at Imperial College Healthcare to help hundreds of long Covid sufferers across the UK to improve their breathing and anxiety. Now rolled out to 50 health trusts nationwide, it vividly illustrates more than ever the worth of music in social prescribing. As traditional concert venues were unable to operate properly, the vision of Bold Tendencies, which 15 years ago reclaimed the Peckham multistorey car park as an exciting arts destination, for residents, with classical music at its heart, became an even more relevant blueprint for what could be emulated nationwide. Non-professional choral societies abound, connecting communities as never before. Other schemes highlighting the positive social impact of classical music include work in Hull focused on stroke recovery, mental health issues among teenagers (Sound Young Minds) and families affected by the criminal justice system (Lullaby Project). The innovative work of these institutions is just the tip of an iceberg of music lovers across the country who strive daily to embed classical music within the UK’s social fabric. Their work, abetted by the social changes precipitated by the pandemic, has resulted in a radical new musical landscape. Never before has there been such a diverse variety of classical music performed by musicians across socioeconomic, gender and racial divides. Many of our concerts or educational activities can be beamed into any home or school at little cost. A coordinated plan from government to use these amazing resources could work wonders for young people. Exposure to the arts at a young age builds confidence and empowers people to question and to explore and to make change happen. Every arts institution is doing work that could be shared with every child online. Exposure to the arts is life changing, life enhancing and the universal right of every citizen. The industry as a whole has confronted the fact that too many people encounter barriers, real or perceived, to entering, remaining in or being successful in the sector and is determined to do something about it. As Alan Davey, controller of BBC Radio 3, eloquently puts it, “The chance to experience classical music as an audience member, or to follow your talent, or choose a career in it, must not depend on your background or come about by chance.” In 2022 I hope audience confidence grows as we begin to live with, rather than be locked in by, Covid. Concert halls and opera houses are among the safest public spaces and can provide a transcendental spiritual experience for as little as a fiver. Anecdotal reports of a vibrant young audience at concerts signify an uplifting trend that will be embraced by all. We have welcomed thousands of new concertgoers at Wigmore Hall this season, a palpable source of joy for musicians, staff and older audiences alike . Further afield, Hamburg’s Elbphilharmonie celebrates its fifth anniversary, having single-handedly trebled the city’s audience. The David Geffen Hall reopens this autumn to provide a home for the New York Philharmonic. An exciting year lies ahead.

1/2/2022,"For years, she was described as a “socialite”, a word that conceals more than it explains. Socialites are almost always women from a wealthy if not an aristocratic background and their defining characteristic is being photographed with famous people. Ghislaine Maxwell fitted the bill, appearing in photos with everyone from Donald Trump to Elon Musk to Prince Andrew. But being a socialite is not a job and it was unclear how she financed her opulent lifestyle, especially after the death of her father, Robert.  Over recent weeks, during her trial on sex trafficking charges in a New York courtroom, the answer became clear. Maxwell’s wealth came from her erstwhile boyfriend, the financier Jeffrey Epstein, who gave her at least $30.7m (£23m) over a period of eight years. By all accounts, Maxwell went from being in love with him to discovering that her usefulness lay elsewhere, in providing a steady stream of young girls to satisfy his depraved sexual appetite. The girls trusted her, thinking of her as an older sister, and only realised later that they had been betrayed. The “socialite” was actually a procurer, a word with deservedly unpleasant connotations. It does not sit easily with Maxwell’s glamorous lifestyle – the planes, helicopters and visits to Epstein’s private island. Many well-known people will surely be regretting that they ever moved in the same circles as Maxwell and Epstein, let alone appear in the aircraft logs revealed in court. Indeed, Maxwell’s conviction last week on five charges seems to have created a kind of cognitive dissonance in some circles, as though such things simply should not happen to a woman with a degree from Balliol . Well-connected individuals who rarely display an interest in American penal policy have complained bitterly about Maxwell’s prison conditions, as though she is in a different class from other inmates. (Assumptions about class are, of course, all over this case.) Her siblings have rallied round, insisting that they cannot accept the jury’s guilty verdicts, although that seems to be more an expression of denial than in any real expectation that she will win an appeal. We know from rape trials that the public imagination struggles to accommodate individuals who challenge stereotypes about sex offenders, whether it is the good-looking date who turns out to be a rapist or the “socialite” who facilitates a paedophile. It is easier to believe terrible things about Rosemary West, a dumpy, working-class woman who helped lure girls into her husband’s car and joined in his abuse of them, than an heiress who once rested her boot on the thigh of an entranced Boris Johnson. Fred and Rose West committed horrific crimes together, torturing their victims as well as killing them, but Fred West was already a murderer when he chose 15-year-old Rosemary Letts, who had a horrendous history of childhood sexual abuse, as his accomplice. Predators have a sixth sense when it comes to choosing co-conspirators. Maxwell was a grown woman when she met Epstein, and fully responsible for the choices she would go on to make, but it is striking that their relationship seems to have begun around the time of her father’s fatal fall from the yacht he named after her, the Lady Ghislaine. It is no excuse to say that the discovery that her father was a fraudster, so soon after his death, would have shaken Maxwell to her foundations. But it may be that Epstein recognised her weaknesses, seized his chance – and got access to an address book that included the Queen’s favourite son, the Duke of York. Maxwell’s connections boosted his sense of impunity, which is perhaps the single most important factor in allowing predators to get away with their crimes. He would later describe Maxwell in humiliating terms as an ex-girlfriend who had fallen on hard times, framing himself as the benefactor who had allowed her to live in the style to which she had become accustomed. The mystery surrounding the source of Epstein’s wealth has led to comparisons with Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic main character in Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, but such mythologising lends a spurious glamour to sordid crimes. It is a depressing fact that women who identify with powerful men often share their misogyny and reflect it back in a desperate quest for approval. Profiles of Epstein remarked on the disturbing fact that his homes were full of teenage girls. “They’re nothing, these girls,” Maxwell once told a confidante. “They are trash.” It must have occurred to Maxwell by now that the two men she put absolute faith in, her father and her ex-lover, both left her to face the music after their apparent suicides. And for what? The columnist Barbara Amiel, who is married to the former newspaper magnate Conrad Black, recalls a conversation that shows Maxwell in an unexpected and highly unflattering light. “I bet I’m in charge of more lavatories and bathrooms than you are,” Maxwell suddenly said as the two women were walking along a beach. While Amiel thought about it, Maxwell reminded her to include those on planes. “Thirty-nine,” said Amiel and Maxwell’s face lit up. “I win,” she exclaimed. Questions about Maxwell’s relationship with Epstein have now been cleared up. She procured girls for him and it speaks volumes about her moral compass, or lack of it, that she evidently cared more about the number of lavatories in his mansions than the vulnerable teenagers she exposed to sexual assault and rape.

1/2/2022,"When Americans go to the polls in the 2022 midterms, the most important elections won’t be for office in Washington. The most high-stakes races will be statewide contests, in some cases for long overlooked offices, that have profound consequences for the future of free and fair elections in America. The races for governor and secretary of state, the chief election official in many places, will determine which officials have control over setting election rules and the post-election certification process.  Allies of Donald Trump and others who have spread baseless conspiracy theories about the election have launched campaigns for several of those offices, both at the statewide and local level, in an effort to take control of election machinery. Trump is expected to run for president in 2024, and if his allies are successful, there are fears they could use their positions to block Trump’s opponent from taking office should Trump lose. Democrats are seeking to hold on to governor’s offices in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, three crucial swing states. The Democratic incumbents in all three states have blocked efforts by GOP-led legislatures to enact voting restrictions so far. There will also be hotly contested elections in Arizona and Georgia, where Republican candidates who have spread lies about the results of the 2020 election are running for governor. Republicans who have embraced lies about the election are also running for secretary of state offices in Michigan, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Overlooked for years, there is now a broader awareness of the enormous power these secretaries of state wield over how elections are run and ballots are counted. That power was on unprecedented display in 2020, when secretaries of state made decisions about things like how to establish ballot drop boxes and whether to automatically send out mail-in ballot applications to voters. Secretaries of state wield enormous unilateral power and, if they were elected, election deniers could do extensive damage in future elections. “It feels like the future of democracy depends on our wins,” said Jena Griswold, Colorado’s secretary of state, who is chair of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State. Few states better encapsulate the stakes for 2022 than Wisconsin. Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat seeking re-election, vetoed a suite of new voting restrictions in August, but Republicans are still chomping at the bit to overhaul the state’s election system. Republicans have launched their own, widely criticized review of the 2020 election and are pushing to get rid of the bipartisan election commission that runs elections in the state. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin’s Republican US senator, has called for the legislature to unilaterally take control of federal elections. Rebecca Kleefisch, a leading Republican candidate for governor, has said she would eliminate the agency if elected. She has also refused to say whether she supports legislation that would allow the Wisconsin legislature, where Republicans essentially hold a permanent majority because of gerrymandering, to overturn election results. Kleefisch’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. There’s a similar dynamic in Michigan. After Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat seeking re-election, vetoed a package of new voting restrictions, Republicans moved aggressively to try to enact them around her veto. There’s also a push to unseat Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s top election official, who became one of the most visible secretaries of state in 2020 when she took steps to make it easier to vote by mail. One of the leading candidates in the GOP field vying to replace Benson is Kristina Karamo, endorsed by Trump, who has claimed Antifa was responsible for the 6 January attack, accused Democrats and Republicans of being “traitors”, and falsely said there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Karamo’s campaign did not respond to an interview request. “It’s certainly not by accident that we’re seeing individuals who don’t believe in democracy aspire to be our state’s’ chief election officers, particularly in the states that were under the greatest spotlight in 2020,” Benson said in an interview. “Observers of democracy should be very concerned about what appears to be a coordinated effort to place people in positions of authority over elections who do not believe in elections and would have willingly overturned election results.” Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf, a term-limited Democrat, also vetoed GOP-backed voting restrictions earlier this year. The GOP candidates running to replace him include Lou Barletta, a former congressman and close Trump ally who has supported the false claim that the election was stolen. Doug Mastriano, a state senator and Trump ally who is one of the most prominent advocates of the election fraud narrative, is also weighing a campaign. Mastriano was at the US capitol on 6 January, pushed baseless voter fraud claims to the justice department, and championed an unusual post-election review in Pennsylvania. In Arizona, Trump has endorsed Kari Lake, a former news anchor seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination who has called for “decertifying” the 2020 election results, something that is not legally possible. Mark Finchem, a Republican state representative who attended the 6 January rally has called for “decertification” of the election results as well. And in Georgia, Trump has endorsed former GOP senator David Perdue in a primary challenge to Republican governor Brian Kemp. Trump has fumed at Kemp, blaming him for not doing enough to overturn the election results last year. Perdue has said he would not have certified the 2020 election results, even after several recounts and audits showed no widespread fraud. The winner will face Stacey Abrams, who made defending voting rights a core issue in her 2018 gubernatorial campaign and has focused on it since. Republicans are also seeking to oust Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state who refused to find enough votes to overturn the election for Trump. Trump’s pick to replace Raffensperger is Jody Hice, a GOP congressman who supported Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. Griswold, who is also running for re-election in 2022, said that putting someone who doesn’t believe in elections in charge of running them was akin to “putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department”. While she said she has been encouraged by a surge in interest among grassroots activists and some donors in secretary of state races, “it is not enough”. “Imagine on January 6 if you had secretaries of state, disregarding all fact, disregarding all law, saying the election was stolen,” she said. “That is what may be coming.”",News/US news,Trump acolytes vie for key election oversight posts in US midterms,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/trump-acolytes-crucial-election-oversight-posts-2022-midterms
