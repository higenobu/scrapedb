12/13/2021,"The founder of Wetherspoons, Tim Martin, has criticised restrictions designed to curb the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 as “arbitrary”, warning that the pub chain’s first half profits could be wiped out by what he called “lockdown by stealth”. In an update to the stock market, JD Wetherspoon told investors that “uncertainty, and the introduction of radical changes of direction by the government, make predictions for sales and profits hazardous”.  The company, which consistently reported soaring sales before the pandemic, suffered a £105.4m loss in the year to July 2020 followed by a record £195m deficit the year after, as coronavirus restrictions took their toll. It had been hoping to rebound from the impact of the pandemic this year but told investors that the government’s plan B for tackling Omicron, including guidance to work from home where possible, meant it was likely to be “loss-making or marginally profitable” for the first half of its financial year. Martin has been one of the most high-profile Brexiters in British business, a role that had previously seen him endorse Boris Johnson. But he has since become an outspoken critic of the prime minister over Covid-19 measures affecting the hospitality industry, which he claims is not a significant source of outbreaks of the disease. “The typical British pub, contrary to received opinion in academia, is usually a bastion of social distancing,” he said on Monday. “However, the repeated warnings and calls for restrictions, mainly from Sage [committee] members and academics, combined with arbitrary changes of direction from the government, invariably at short notice, affect customer sentiment and trade. “In effect, the country appears to be heading towards a lockdown by stealth.” He cited comments made by Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, who has said the Omicron variant does not warrant the “extreme action” taken by the UK government. Martin added: “For reasons best known to themselves, perhaps in order to encourage more vaccinations, the UK government and its advisers are creating an entirely different and more frightening impression of the variant, which appears to be at odds with the South African experience. “In spite of these problems, booster vaccinations and better weather in the spring are likely to have a positive impact [on Wetherspoons’ trading] in the coming months.”",News/Business,Wetherspoons says Johnson’s ‘lockdown by stealth’ will hit pub’s profits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/wetherspoons-says-johnsons-lockdown-by-stealth-will-hit-pubs-profits
12/13/2021,"“We need the ball and we need to control the game,” said Domenico Tedesco, summing up his plans at RB Leipzig after a first game, and a first win. If the phrase was fairly anodyne in terms of a new coach setting out his ambitions for a club that wants to continue climbing, it pricked up the ears. This was not from what many thought was the Tedesco playbook. There was a circularity, if not an inevitability, about the 36-year-old pitching up here. Not just because of his fitting the youthful outlook of the club, and not just because he was a coursemate and friend of Julian Nagelsmann in DFB coaching class going back seven years. Tedesco had made his top-flight coaching debut against Leipzig in August 2017, freshly installed in the top job at Schalke in the days when it felt like they might just be a forward-thinking club who could lose their culture of waste without bottoming out, like they did in last season’s relegation.  It was a significant game not just for the tyro Tedesco but, it felt, for the Bundesliga as a whole. Leipzig had adapted so smoothly to the top flight for the first time. Against the backdrop of an administrative model that deeply offended swathes of the Bundesliga’s fan community – and they were made to know by just how much on a regular basis – they made clear that they weren’t going anywhere in a hurry. The sporting side of the model not only made light of the leap between divisions, but they offered the promise of sustainability. Ralph Hasenhüttl’s team had the Bundesliga worked out in an instant. Tedesco’s Schalke had an answer to that. In the opening game of the season in Gelsenkirchen, the home side had a plan. Leipzig like to attack, so let them have the ball and see how they deal with it. It was the ultimate second album syndrome for Leipzig – they were in their plush residential studio with writer’s block, drinking endless cups of tea, playing pool and trying to recycle offcuts from their debut. Schalke had 36% possession that day and they picked the visitors off expertly, winning 2-0 in a style that was very un-Schalke, where front foot football is traditionally encouraged and appreciated. Relatively soon after Roberto Di Matteo’s cautious approach had finished him at the club, Tedesco dared to go circumspect – and it was clear a largely experienced squad were singing off the same hymn sheet straight away. Saturday’s debut in charge yielded similarly instant gratification as Tedesco’s new charges swatted aside an ailing Borussia Mönchengladbach and it demonstrated not just the new man’s ability to muster some unity but his way of absorbing what a set of players need, as he had done well at Spartak Moscow post-Schalke. “I heard the team was longing for possession,” he said after the game, underlining that keying in with players who hadn’t really clicked with his predecessor Jesse Marsch had been paramount. “Pressing was [only] the second priority today.” So Leipzig started like a train against prone opponents, showing no mercy. With a return to three at the back Angeliño was off the leash, creating first-half goals for Josko Gvardiol and the waking André Silva, scorer in four of his last five games. Gladbach benefitted from an incredible reprieve when Silva it the bar with Yann Sommer miles out of his goal after the goalkeeper lost the ball to Christopher Nkunku, but Ramy Bensabaini’s smart finish late on for Gladbach, which should have set up a final push for the visitors, merely provoked Leipzig into finishing off the game as they should have done before, via Nkunku and Benny Henrichs. Leipzig now have the opportunity to garland their revival and push towards the top four, with Augsburg then Arminia Bielefeld next up. “We have one of the best squads in the Bundesliga. The aim is to qualify at least for the Champions League,” emphasised CEO Oliver Mintzlaff. Tedesco has no excuses but he appears canny enough to adapt to his surrounds, even if going against the grain.  On the other side of the coin in Saxony was Gladbach having collected a third straight defeat, with the matches accumulating two goals for and 14 against in total. “The question is how we can get out of this together,” said coach Adi Hütter, though it was not a huge leap of faith to suspect that the expensively recruited coach is standing on rapidly thinning ice. Sporting director Max Eberl isn’t hiding from the criticism and fulfilled his appearance on Das Aktuelle Sportstudio in which he outlined his concerns. “We have to show balls now,” he demanded, though interestingly didn’t repeat his unconditional backing of Hütter from the aftermath of last week’s thrashing by Freiburg. “Of course the coach is responsible,” Eberl said, “but I’m responsible too.” Next up on Wednesday is Eintracht Frankfurt, Hütter’s old club.  In a weekend when Joshua Kimmich gave a television interview with ZDF if in which he spoke about his regret for not getting vaccinated sooner – and saving Bayern a few weeks of consternation – his team clawed their way to a satisfying win over a good Mainz team without him, having been a goal down at half-time. Jamal Musiala, who was also quarantined twice in the last month, delighted Julian Nagelsmann with his winner and his increasing all-round application, though the coach stressed that “Jamal doesn’t have to become Gennaro Gattuso”. 🎥 @FCBayernEN come from behind to extend their lead at the 🔝, thanks to goals from Kingsley #Coman and @JamalMusiala 🤝 pic.twitter.com/Drdx38bN8Z  Should we more surprised that Borussia Dortmund failed to keep pace by dropping points at Bochum, or that the home side couldn’t close what would have been a fourth successive home win? Substitute Julian Brandt’s late equaliser saved BVB from the full nightmare on Castroper Straße, but the ‘mini-derby’ always looked destined to cause them problems, especially given the fortitude of Thomas Reis’s team in recent weeks. “Dortmund were superior in terms of play, and in terms of stats, but I don’t care about that today,” said Reis.  Nobody, it appears, is in the form to press Bayern. After their recent surge Leverkusen took an early 2-0 lead at Eintracht Frankfurt via a Patrik Schick double – only to subsequently be buried under an avalanche of five unanswered goals from the home side, capped by another Djibril Sow rocket from range. “The way we performed [after going two down] was unbelievable,” said coach Oliver Glasner of his improving side.

Despite CEO Thomas Hitzlsperger’s imminent departure sporting director Sven Mislintat has reiterated his commitment. “I’m here because this club is fantastic,” he enthused. The home side were rather less chipper after a fifth loss in a row, which has also incorporated an exit from Europe, though sporting director Jörg Schmadtke pointed out new-ish coach Florian Kohfeldt is “paying for things he isn’t responsible for”.  Joy at last for Greuther Fürth, managing their first win of the season and – perhaps even more unbelievably – their maiden top-flight victory at home by beating Union Berlin 1-0 on Sunday thanks to Havard Nielsen’s winner. Coach Stefan Leitl defended himself during the week against accusations of playing too openly and this win and clean sheet was the perfect riposte. “You score a dirty goal and defend to the end,” enthused goalkeeper Sascha Burchert. “That’s the way.”",Sport/Football,Tedesco goes against the grain to get RB Leipzig up and running | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/13/tedesco-goes-against-the-grain-to-get-rb-leipzig-up-and-running
12/13/2021,"Mole, pronounced “moll-ay”, is from the Nahuatl word molli, meaning “sauce”, hence guacamole is an avocado salsa. The UK has had an incredible food renaissance over the past 15 years, and so, too, has Mexico, with its chefs creating all sorts of modern interpretations of moles using different nuts, herbs, vegetables and fruits. Today’s velvety one is simple by mole standards, but it has a rich, complex flavour that adds real oomph to the golden roast cauliflower.  If you can’t get hold of pasilla chillies, use two ancho chillies instead. A powerful blender will help make your sauce silky-smooth. Prep 15 minCook 50 minServes 4 120g skin-on almonds1 large cauliflower, leaves removed (save them for another dish)3 tbsp olive oilSalt and pepper2 pasilla chillies (25g), or 2 ancho chillies, stems and seeds removed, flesh torn into a few pieces60g prunes1 medium onion, peeled and cut into 6 wedges2 garlic cloves, unpeeled2-3 tomatoes (200g)¼ tsp ground allspice¼ tsp ground cinnamon1-2 tbsp sherry vinegar30g butter or lard For the crispy capers2 tbsp olive oil4 tbsp capers, drained Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/375F/gas 4. Lay out the nuts on a baking tray, toast in the oven for 10-15 minutes, until golden, then leave to cool. Turn up the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Cut away the stem of the cauliflower, leaving the core, and steam for five minutes, until tender in the centre (or microwave for five minutes). Put on an oven tray, rub all over with the olive oil, season and roast for 30-35 minutes, until dark golden. Meanwhile, heat a dry frying pan on a medium heat, toast the chillies for 20-30 seconds, until fragrant, then transfer to a small bowl, cover with boiling water and set aside for 10-15 minutes. Plump up the prunes by covering them with boiling water, too. Put the onions, garlic and tomatoes in the chilli pan, and dry toast, turning frequently, for five to six minutes for the garlic and eight to 10 minutes for the onions and tomatoes, until charred all over and the garlic is tender. Put 70g of the cooled nuts in a powerful blender with the onions, garlic, tomatoes, drained chillies and prunes. Add the spices and vinegar, then run the motor, pouring in 150ml water little by little and stopping frequently to scrape down the sides. Season with a teaspoon of sea salt and continue to blitz, adding enough extra water to create a sauce the consistency of double cream. Heat the butter/lard in a saucepan, then pour in the sauce and fry for 10 minutes, to cook it out and give the ingredients a chance to meld. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Put a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the two tablespoons of oil, fry the capers until crisp, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to kitchen paper to drain. Once the cauliflower is cooked, cut it into quarters and put each piece on a bed of the mole. Sprinkle the capers and remaining almonds on top before serving with rice and soured cream. Try using chicken stock instead of water for extra flavour. The mole is also delicious with pan-fried venison, or garnish the cauliflower with sauteed lardons as well as capers.

12/13/2021,"Officers searching for the missing hospital worker Petra Srncova are not treating her disappearance as suspicious, they have said, after a body was found in a park in south London. Police have not formally identified the body, which was discovered close to where the 32-year-old was last seen, but they have informed the senior nurse assistant’s relatives.  Srncova was reported missing five days after failing to return home from her shift at Evelina London children’s hospital in Westminster on Sunday 28 November. It was thought she was travelling to her home in the Camberwell area. The body was discovered in Brunswick Park in the same part of the capital just before lunchtime on Sunday – two weeks after her disappearance. The local MP, Labour’s Harriet Harman, was among those to leave floral tributes to Srncova on Monday as she expressed her “deepest sympathy” to the Czech national’s relatives. RIP Petra Srncova.

Our thoughts are with Petra’s family, friends and colleagues at this hugely difficult time.

12/13/2021,"Newcastle have made the Lille centre-back Sven Botman a priority signing in the January transfer window with Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard also on Eddie Howe’s wishlist. The upcoming transfer window will be Newcastle’s first under new ownership and they are in desperate need of reinforcements, sitting 19th in the table after one win in their first 16 games. They are, however, only three points from Watford above the relegation zone and Howe is confident of dragging the side out of trouble if the right players are signed.  Botman, a 21-year-old Dutch defender who has been with Lille since 2020, has been targeted as the first-choice centre-back to reinforce a unit that has conceded the most goals in the Premier League, 34. Lille, however, may be reluctant to sell the defender mid-season with the team having qualified for the Champions League last 16 and struggling in mid-table in the league. Newcastle would have to pay at least £30m but Lille could ask for as much as £40m. Milan are another club keen on Botman’s services, needing a replacement for Simon Kjær, who has suffered a long-term injury. Howe is also looking to sign Lingard from United, either on loan or on a permanent deal. The 28-year-old has yet to start a league game this campaign. West Ham, too, are interested in Lingard with the player having had a successful loan spell there for the second part of the 2020-21 season.",Sport/Football,Newcastle target Sven Botman signing with Jesse Lingard on radar too,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/13/newcastle-target-sven-botman-signing-with-jesse-lingard-on-radar-too
12/13/2021,"Two feuding Amazonian politicians have settled their differences with an ultimate fighting-style rumble in the jungle that has fuelled fears over the increasingly antagonistic nature of Brazilian democracy. Simão Peixoto, the mayor of Borba, a town 90 miles south of Manaus, was publicly challenged to the fistfight in September by a former councillor called Erineu da Silva.  Silva, who uses the nickname Mirico, was reportedly livid at the mayor’s alleged failure to conserve a waterpark near the Madeira river and demanded a showdown with a politician he called a “rotter” and a “crook”. Peixoto accepted the challenge, publishing an online video in which he indicated his readiness to thrash his antagonist by pummelling his palm with his fist. “Show your face!” the mayor told Mirico. Peixoto softened his tone after some voters suggested that was conduct unbecoming of the man elected to govern their Amazon outpost. The mayor assured citizens he would only take part in an organised altercation inside a ring. “I’m not a street fighter … I’m the mayor of the municipality of Borba,” the politician said on his official Facebook page in early November. “[But] if he really wants to fight … we’re ready to fight … I’ve always been a winner.” A month later, in the early hours of Sunday, the fighting commenced, with hundreds of paying spectators packing the gymnasium of a local school.

The mayor appeared in a bellicose mood as he stamped on the platform and squared up to his rival. “Twice he went over to his opponent’s corner and ran his finger across his throat – the sign of a reaper,” reported the website BNC Amazonas. Witnesses to the 13-minute skirmish – which Peixoto’s team livestreamed – said Borba’s conservative mayor landed several painful blows. In the opening seconds, the 39-year-old briefly knocked Mirico on to the ground. But Mirico, 45, battled back. After three shambolic rounds, “the mayor of Borba was almost unable to walk because of the number of low kicks he received from his adversary,” reported BNC Amazonas. “The mayor took such a beating his jaw dropped,” another regional website, Fato Amazônico, reported. Even so, Peixoto prevailed. “Strangely, Mirico lost on points,” Fato Amazônico said. “‘A stitch-up,’ spectators shouted, disgusted with the result.” The brawl in Borba was not the only episode of political violence reported in Brazil this weekend. On Sunday, security guards and supporters of the country’s far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, were accused of assaulting journalists as they covered a presidential visit. “What we are seeing is the reflex of a climate of hostility towards the press created by the president,” tweeted Andréia Sadi, a prominent political journalist. Some Brazilians saw the Amazonian dust-up as further evidence of the truculent political atmosphere that has gripped their country since Bolsonaro’s 2018 election. “This is what politics in Brazil has become of late. It’s frightening,” one critic tweeted, alongside footage of the fisticuffs in Borba. “We’ve become the wild west.”",News/World news,Brazilian politicians in three-round punch-up after waterpark feud,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/brazilian-politicians-in-three-round-punch-up-after-waterpark-feud
12/13/2021,"France’s interior minister is seeking to dissolve an “ultra right” group suspected of attacking anti-racism protesters who entered a campaign rally held by the far-right presidential candidate Éric Zemmour. The Zouaves, who support Zemmour’s anti-immigration and anti-Islam ideology, are thought to be behind the brawl, which happened eight days ago.  Members from the anti-racial discrimination group SOS Racisme were set upon after they entered the rear of the venue to protest against Zemmour. The group said it had aimed to protest peacefully but five of its members were injured. In one clip taken that night, a man was caught violently punching the head of a young woman who was wearing a “No to racism” T-shirt. Other assailants kicked and threw chairs at protesters. After the meeting, police said they had identified about 50 people linked to the Zouaves who posed for a picture and chanted: “On est chez nous” (this is our home), according to AFP. On Sunday, the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said he had begun legal action to have the Zouaves movement outlawed and hoped the State Council would agree to the ban. “I have initiated the procedure to dissolve this de facto grouping that are the Zouaves, which is a group of people who come from either the GUD [a former far-right student union] or Action Française, that is to say, well-known ultra right movements,” Darmanin told French media. Marion Jacquet-Vaillant, a doctor of political science specialising in extreme “identity” groups, said the Zouaves Paris organisation brought together “people from other groups for quick, violent actions”. Some members also belonged to Génération Identitaire, a far-right “paramilitary” group the French government banned in March. Jean-Yves Camus, a political analyst from the Jean-Jaurès Foundation thinktank, added that the group was “above all, ultra-violent and ultra-right”. “They have by far one of the most violent pedigrees of all far-right groups,” Camus told Ouest-France. “Their only raison d’être is to fight … fight against antifa, leftwingers in general, anything seen as feminist, LGBT, pro-migrants … etc,” he added. He said the group had no robust ideology. “There are no precise references, nor any intellectual reasoning. It’s a fight to defend French identity, full stop.” The Zouaves are suspected of being behind several violent assaults in recent years, including attacks on football supporters waving Algerian flags in Paris during the 2018 World Cup held in Russia and against a radio journalist during a protest last year. They have also been linked to violence at Gilets Jaunes demonstrations. Made up almost entirely of men in their 20s and 30s, Zouaves is believed to have no formal structure but gravitates around a dozen members that get together to carry out hit-and-run actions. Last month, five Zouaves members appeared in court after an attack on a Paris bar reportedly known to be frequented by antifascists where drinkers were attacked with baseball bats and teargas. The public prosecutor has opened an investigation into the violence at Zemmour’s meeting. Dominique Sopo, the president of SOS Racisme, told Franceinfo radio: “You either have to be drunk with racism or be certain of your omnipotence to be able to act like that in front of cameras. It’s absolutely astonishing and it shows what this candidate is and what the public he draws is and who the militants who gathered there are.”",News/World news,France seeks to ban ultra-right group suspected of attacking anti-racists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/france-seeks-to-ban-ultra-right-group-suspected-of-attacking-anti-racists
12/13/2021,"US president Joe Biden declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky after a swarm of deadly tornadoes hit the state on Friday, as representatives of a candle factory destroyed by a twister said far fewer people may have died than previously feared. Biden had previously declared the storms a federal emergency and the move to designate the storms a federal disaster paves the way for additional aid, as thousands face housing, food, water and power shortages.  It follows a formal request from Kentucky governor Andy Beshear who said the tornadoes were the most destructive in the state’s history. Beshear had said on Sunday morning that the death toll was expected to exceed 100 after twisters tore through the US midwest and south on Friday night but later that figure had been revised down, although amid power cuts and phone services down across many communities, there was not yet certainty over numbers. Dozens of people in several counties in the state are still believed to have died in the storms, but Beshear said later on Sunday that the death toll might be as low as 50, according to the Associated Press. “We are praying that maybe original estimates of those we have lost were wrong. If so, it’s going to be pretty wonderful,” the governor said. Among the 110 people who were at the candle factory, eight have been confirmed dead and eight others remained missing, said Bob Ferguson, a spokesperson for Mayfield Consumer Products, which owns the factory. He said 90 people had been located, a figure that authorities were still trying to confirm on Monday morning. “There were some early reports that as many as 70 could be dead in the factory. One is too many, but we thank God that the number is turning out to be far, far fewer,” Ferguson said, adding that rescue teams were still searching for the eight who remained unaccounted for. It was unclear how many factory workers Beshear was counting in his latest death toll estimates. By Monday morning, weather experts had estimated that more than 40 tornadoes hit parts of nine states. Rescue workers continued to scour debris for survivors and many people without power, water or even a roof over their heads salvaged what they could two days after disaster struck. While Kentucky was hardest hit, six workers were killed at an Amazonwarehouse in Illinois after the plant buckled under the force of the tornado, including one cargo driver who died in the bathroom, where many workers said they had been directed to shelter. A nursing home was struck in Arkansas, causing one of that state’s two deaths. Four were reported dead in Tennessee and two in Missouri. Nowhere suffered as much as Mayfield, a community of about 10,000 in the south-western corner of Kentucky, where the large twisters also destroyed the fire and police stations. The governor said the tornadoes were the most destructive in the state’s history. “The very first thing that we have to do is grieve together and we’re going to do that before we rebuild together,” Beshear said, noting that one tornado tore across 227 miles (365 km) of terrain, almost all of that in Kentucky. A vast storm front moved across the Mississippi basin and parts of the US south-east and midwest on Friday night, spawning more than 30 tornadoes. Spring is the main season for tornadoes and this latest event was very unusual coming in December, when colder weather normally limits tornadoes, said Victor Gensini, an extreme weather researcher at Northern Illinois University. Asked if he thought the intensity of the storms was related to climate crisis, president Biden said: “All I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet. The specific impact on these specific storms, I can’t say at this point.” Illinois was hit, too, and six people were killed in the collapse of an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, with another injured worker airlifted to a hospital, fire chief James Whiteford said. In addition, so far four people have been reported killed in Tennessee, two in Arkansas and two in Missouri as well as the high toll in Kentucky. Kyanna Parsons-Perez, who was at the candle factory in Mayfield, said she felt the building was making her and her co-workers “rock from one side to the other” right before it collapsed. Parsons-Perez was stuck for three hours in the rubble, and documented part of it in a livestream on Facebook in which her co-workers can be heard crying in fear. Sitting in the hospital, she told the Guardian how a gust of wind suddenly changed everything. “My ears started popping and I felt my body swaying,” she said of the moments right before the building collapsed. She became very scared upon learning that she was buried under. “When I found out it was an air conditioner on me and five people on the debris on top of me is when I got scared,” she said. The storm was so powerful that a photograph from a tornado-damaged home in Kentucky was found almost 130 miles away in Indiana. The US uniquely experiences more than 1,200 tornadoes annually, more than four times the number in other countries around the world where they occur, combined, according to experts.

12/13/2021,"If I close my eyes and think of Stephen Sondheim, I remember him sitting in my kitchen in north London. It wasn’t a showbiz fest. It was just talking about nothing, about life, about dogs. He was this amazing, mellow man, so personable and warm. Even at the time, I thought, blimey, here is this legend, having a beer in my kitchen. That’s one for the book! He was so extraordinary, the last of the big boys, the final link with the great American songbook, a man with personal connections to Oscar Hammerstein and Leonard Bernstein. He changed musicals, made unhappy musicals happen. He set down such a very good path that led in so many different directions.  We first met in 1990 in my dressing room at the Phoenix theatre when I was playing the Baker’s Wife in Richard Jones’s production of Into the Woods. He said he’d like to thank me for what I was doing with the character. And because I was nervous, I just sort of blurted out: “Well, you don’t write an easy tune, do you Stephen?” There was a particular note I couldn’t get, and I told him. He said: “Change it. Just change it.” That was such a shock to me because I wasn’t really a Sondheim aficionado at that point, and people who were said you couldn’t touch anything in his work. After that, of course, I decided I’d really try to do it as he’d written it. But that was Stephen all over. He never made you feel inadequate. He only ever wanted all of us to be our very best. I didn’t see him again until I took on Mrs Lovett in Sweeney Todd in 2011. We were in Chichester, which is lovely because you can gather in the bar after the show, and all the younger actors were beside themselves with excitement. He knew that and sat with them; he was never someone who just wanted to sit with the director or the producer. He knew how much he meant to people. What struck me was his joy at seeing a production of his work. He would never say, well you know, we did it like this at such and such a time, or imply that he wished we were doing it differently. I thought: gosh, this is a lesson, isn’t it? To be so present and so very encouraging about what was happening now. I am sure he gave the director and the music director loads of things to think about, but he created an atmosphere where it was easy to be creative, not to be stifled by someone else’s view. He was never locked into a vision of how something should be done. A year later, when I knew I was going to be playing Momma Rose in Gypsy, my husband, Jim, and I went to Stephen’s house in New York for dinner. We went into this lovely room full of what I thought were awards, but they turned out to be the most extraordinary metal puzzles. There were also all these wonderful things to do with magic and circus. Jim is really into that as well, so the whole night I didn’t get a word in edgeways. For me, his work is not about how the songs sound. It’s how they feel. In one respect, he’s done so much of the work for you. You don’t have to worry about how you are going to make the songs work; you just have to read them. He wrote monologues and then, in the music, he gave you the rhythm and the heartbeat of each one. They are challenging and intricate but that makes them more satisfying to do. When I was singing Gypsy, we talked a lot about motherhood, and bad parenting. We discussed the lyrics and how much his own journey with his mother informed this particular mother. He writes so well about pain. And joy. He’s Shakespearean in that way. He’s like Shakespeare too because, like all the best writing, there’s no one way to do him. His work is just so rich. I’d kept in touch with him, through emails, until he died. But the last time I actually saw him was at Follies at the National Theatre in 2017, when I played Sally. He gave me the only specific note I remember him giving me, about Losing My Mind. He said: “Don’t even try to make it sound anything other than a nervous breakdown. Don’t worry how it sounds. This is a woman just tumbling down.” Anyhow, at the end of the first preview, I stepped forward and said: “Look ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sondheim is in the building, and we just have to recognise this man.” He was standing on the staircase, and we all clapped for what seemed like five hours. I thought: I don’t know when this will happen again. I wanted to do that for him. I am really glad I did.",Arts/Stage,Those we lost in 2021: Stephen Sondheim remembered by Imelda Staunton,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/13/obituaries-2021-stephen-sondheim-remembered-by-imelda-staunton
