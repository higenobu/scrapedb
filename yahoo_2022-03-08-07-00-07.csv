3/8/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Aleksandar Vasovic LVIV/KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Fighting stopped about 200,000 people from evacuating the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol for a second day in a row on Sunday, as Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to press ahead with his invasion unless Kyiv surrendered. Most people trapped in the port city are sleeping underground to escape more than six days of near-constant shelling by encircling Russian forces that has cut off food, water, power and heating supplies, according to the Ukrainian authorities. In a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Putin said he was ready for dialogue to end the fighting but that any attempt to draw out talks would fail, according to the Kremlin. The suspension of what Moscow describes as a special operation, ""is only possible if Kyiv stops military operations and carries out well-known Russian demands,"" the Kremlin said in a readout of the Putin-Erdogan call. The civilian death toll from hostilities across Ukraine since Moscow launched its invasion on Feb. 24 stood at 364, including more than 20 children, the United Nations said on Sunday, adding that hundreds more were injured. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said most civilian casualties were caused by the use of ""explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes."" Russia has launched about 600 missiles so far, according to a senior U.S. defense official. The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said the Russians were ""beginning to accumulate resources for the storming of Kyiv"". Moscow has repeatedly denied attacking civilian areas. In Irpin, a town some 25 km (16 miles) northwest of the capital Kyiv, men, women and children trying to escape heavy fighting in the area were forced to take cover when missiles struck nearby, according to Reuters witnesses. Soldiers and fellow residents helped the elderly hurry to a bus filled with frightened people, some cowering as they waited to be driven to safety. The invasion has drawn widespread condemnation around the world, sent more than 1.5 million Ukrainians fleeing from the country, and triggered sweeping Western sanctions against Russia aimed at crippling its economy. The Biden administration said on Sunday it was exploring banning imports of Russian oil, despite concerns the move would drive prices even higher. Oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 and jumped 10% in early Asian trade on Monday. Russia provides 7% of global supply. ""War is madness, please stop,"" Pope Francis said in his weekly address to crowds in St Peter's Square, adding ""rivers of blood and tears"" were flowing in Ukraine's war. Russian media said Putin also spoke by phone for almost two hours with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron told Putin he was concerned about a possible amphibious attack on Ukraine's historic port city of Odessa, Macron's office said. The United States does not believe such an attack is imminent, the senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'NO TO WAR' Anti-war protests took place around the world, including in Russia itself, where police detained more than 4,600 people, an independent protest monitoring group said. The interior ministry said 3,500 demonstrators had been held, included 1,700 people in Moscow and 750 in St Petersburg. Thousands of protesters chanted ""No to war!"" and ""Shame on you!"", according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers. Reuters was unable to independently verify the footage and photographs. Demonstrations also took place in Western capitals as well as in India and Kazakhstan, after jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny called for worldwide protests against the war. In the besieged city of Mariupol, authorities had said on Sunday they would make a second attempt to evacuate some of the 400,000 residents. But the ceasefire plan collapsed, as it had on Saturday, with each side blaming the other. ""They're destroying us,"" Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko told Reuters in a video call, describing the city's plight before the latest evacuation effort failed. ""They will not even give us an opportunity to count the wounded and the killed because the shelling does not stop."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States has seen credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians in Ukraine, adding that Washington was documenting them to support a potential war crimes investigation. Moscow says it has no plans to occupy Ukraine. The U.S. defense official estimated Russia has deployed about 95% of the combat forces it had staged outside Ukraine. In the capital, Ukrainian soldiers bolstered defences by digging trenches, blocking roads and liaising with civil defence units as Russian forces bombarded areas nearby. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russian rockets had destroyed the civilian airport of the central-western region capital of Vinnytsia. Troops who committed atrocities against civilians would ultimately face punishment, he said. ""For you there will be no peaceful place on this earth, except for the grave,"" he said in a televised evening address. Russian forces opened fire at a protest against their occupation of the southern Ukrainian city of Nova Kakhovka on Sunday, wounding five people, Ukrainian news agency Interfax Ukraine said, citing eyewitnesses. PLEA FOR MORE WEAPONS Kyiv renewed its appeal to the West to toughen sanctions and also requested more weapons, including Russian-made planes. Speaking on a trip to neighbouring Moldova, Blinken said Washington was considering how it could backfill aircraft for Poland if Warsaw decided to supply its warplanes to Ukraine. Putin says he wants a ""demilitarised"", ""denazified"" and neutral Ukraine, and on Saturday likened Western sanctions ""to a declaration of war"". The West, which calls Putin's reasons for invading baseless, has expanded efforts to rearm Ukraine, sending in items from Stinger missiles to anti-tank weapons. But Washington and its NATO allies have resisted Ukraine's plea for a no-fly zone, saying it would escalate the conflict beyond Ukraine's borders. Ukrainians continued to pour into Poland, Romania, Slovakia and elsewhere. The United Nations said over 1.5 million had fled in Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two. Western sanctions have pushed many companies to exit investments in Russia, while some Russian banks have been shut out of a global financial payment systems, driving down the rouble and forcing Moscow to jack up interest rates. On Sunday, more companies cut ties with Russia: American Express Co, Netflix Inc., accounting giants KPMG and PwC, and video sharing app TikTok. But Chinese firms so far are staying put. Ukraine's military said more than 11,000 Russian troops had been killed so far and 88 Russian aircraft shot down since the start of the invasion. Reuters could not corroborate the claim. Russia has not given regular updates on its death toll. Tass news agency cited Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov as saying virtually the entire Ukrainian air force had been destroyed. In the last 36 hours alone, he said, Ukraine had lost 11 combat aircraft and two helicopters. Reuters had no way of corroborating the claim.

3/8/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) attempted to blame Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Joe Biden Monday, only to be brutally humiliated by an acknowledged expert on the situation: Retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. It started when the controversial lawmaker posted a tweet on Sunday claiming “Biden’s poor decision making leading up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin declaring war on Ukraine.” But Vindman, who as a former national security aide offered key testimony in President Donald Trump’s 2019 impeachment for dealings with Ukraine, refused to let Greene’s statement go by without a fact check. “Nope. It’s because you and your pro-Putin party encouraged Putin to invade, by cheerleading him,” Vindman responded. Vindman’s wife, Rachel Vindman, also chimed in, calling Greene “crazy stupid” and asking, “why do you insist on telling us over and over?” Greene attacked Vindman, saying he wants to “drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN,” but didn’t deny the substance of his arguments. Nor did she deny or object to him accusing her and the GOP of being “pro-Putin.” Vindman later responded with a heartfelt tweet reminding Greene and others that he proudly served in the U.S. Army after he and his family came to the country as refugees. Others chimed in with their own snarky comments. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/8/2022,"Tim Shanley, 32, from Sydney... and I am a product manager in the Superannuation industry
 I got married in late 2019 and was in relatively good shape. After coming back from my honeymoon my wife and I bought our first home together and I was on cloud nine. Then Covid hit in early 2020, and I started to work from home full-time. While I was still on a mental high, I was enjoying myself a little bit too much, and as a result my exercise and fitness regime took a back seat with gyms being closed, and so did my diet. I lost all structure and routine in my life and ended up over-eating, drinking too much alcohol, and pretty much stopped exercising. At my heaviest I tipped the scales at 113 kgs (249 pounds). I had lost all of my confidence, I was not feeling good about myself both mentally and physically, and I was starting to get concerned about my overall health and wellbeing from things such as elevated blood pressure, increased stress, trouble sleeping, and irritability. I was not happy, and was seeking joy artificially from comforts such as alcohol and food. Seeing myself in a photo from a wedding in late 2020 was my lightbulb moment. I didn’t like what I saw: I couldn’t accept the fact I had let myself go so much, and felt embarrassed. I realised I needed to make a change and make a change fast, so I reached out to the professionals to help me pull my finger out! I contacted Ultimate Performance in Sydney in late 2020 with the intention of starting 2021 fresh with a new mindset and with some big goals to get my life back on track. My program consisted of four workouts a week, two with my trainer and two by myself, which were a combination of full body high intensity, resistance training and heavy weight workouts. I also walked between a minimum of 15,000 to 20,000 steps a day every day. My program was 20 weeks long in total, and my target was to get down to 10 percent bodyfat. When I started the program, my thought process and attitude towards my diet completely changed and allowed me to take more accountability for what I was putting into my body and kept me honest. I started to watch what I was eating more closely though understanding macros, meal timing and nutrition. My trainer Saskia believed in me from day one. She gave me the motivation and encouragement needed to achieve my goals and equipped me with the tools to push myself to places I didn’t think I could go. She was very unselfish with her knowledge on health and fitness and was constantly feeding me information about how to train correctly, how to diet and understand nutrition, how to listen to my body and how to be confident and positive! I lost a total of 33 kgs (73 pounds) in 20 weeks and hit 10 percent body fat by the end of the journey which was one of my main goals. It was a long grind, but all worth it in the end and I couldn’t have been happier. The physical results speak for themselves, however it’s the things you can't see that I was more satisfied with, such as regaining my confidence, lowering blood pressure, improving my quality of sleep, and just having overall better and more consistent moods. Now I go to bed happy and wake up happy! You don’t need to have a background in strength training or weights to be able to achieve your health and fitness goals. I think it all comes down to attitude, discipline and commitment – if you have these three things, plus a positive mindset, most of the battle is already won. While the physical elements are tough, they are short lived, whereas the mental battle of sticking to a diet and routine is constant, but if you are able to hit small goals, your overall long term goals will be easier to achieve.

3/8/2022,"(Adds report of civilian deaths) LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Pro-Russian separatists have carried out an offensive in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Sunday and fighting took place mostly in the western part of the city, Russia's defence ministry said on Monday. The ministry said Russian troops would suspend fire to open a humanitarian corridor out of the encircled city of 400,000 people on Monday. Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov accused Ukrainian forces of using a group of more than 150 civilians as human shields to fire at the separatist forces. He said four civilians had been killed and five wounded as a result, but that the forces from the Donetsk People's Republic, part of eastern Ukraine recognised as independent by Moscow, had ""liberated"" around 150 civilians, taking them into territory they controlled.

3/8/2022,"A south Florida teacher was taken to the hospital last week after she was attacked by a 5-year-old student, leaving her ""dazed"" and ""unresponsive,"" authorities said. The unidentified instructor was found by first responders “sitting on the ground against the wall"" and ""appearing to be in a faint state"" at Pines Lakes Elementary School, about 15 miles southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale, according to a heavily redacted Pembroke Pines Police Department incident report. The victim was ""clearly weak and dazed,"" able to ""blink and breathe regularly but at no point was able to vocally respond or show signs of a response,"" the report said. The troubling incident started when a 5-year-old boy had to be removed from class for “throwing things around” and “flipping the chairs,” police said. The youngster was taken to an empty “cool down” room, where the attack on the teacher allegedly took place, police said. The teacher was taken to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and has since been released, officials said. While the young suspect is still being investigated for possible ""aggravated assault with hands, fist and feet,"" it's unlikely he'll be criminally prosecuted, a police spokesman told NBC News on Monday. Prosecutors would be hard pressed to show that this 5-year-old had the ability distinguish right from wrong, the police representative said. Police declined to reveal any identifying information on the victim, such as her age. A representative for the teachers union could not be immediately reached for comment. Broward County Public Schools officials referred all questions to police. The district, though, did share a message that Principal Susan Sasse sent to parents and staff, acknowledging there had been ""an incident that occurred in school"" which required ""a staff member to be transported to a local medical facility"" on Wednesday. ""At all times during the incident, our campus was secured,"" Sasse reported. ""As always, the health, safety and well being of our students and staff continues to be my highest priority.""

3/8/2022,"The Queen is to make a permanent move to Windsor Castle after not staying at Buckingham Palace for two years. The 95-year-old monarch has been ""working from home"" at the Berkshire castle since the pandemic began. She is now set to stay there permanently as renovations at Buckingham Palace continue for another five years, the Sunday Times reported. The move came as the Queen recovers from Covid-19 and another undisclosed health issue that saw her spend a night in hospital in October and then several weeks resting on doctors' advice. At an official engagement in February, she was pictured leaning on a walking stick and told visitors: ""As you can see, I can't move."" Buckingham Palace will remain the central headquarters of the monarchy, though the Queen is now expected to carry out her engagements both virtually and in person from Windsor, the Telegraph understands, as well as going to events outside the castle. In London, she is expected to attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 14 and a service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip at the abbey on March 29. She is also expected to take on a visible role at June's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The Queen and Royal family are expected to appear on the balcony on June 2 for her official birthday parade. The festivities - for which the UK has been given a four-day bank holiday weekend - will also include Trooping the Colour and a music festival, the Platinum Party at the Palace, on Saturday, June 4. The move marks the end of an era, as the Queen's royal standard - a signal to the world that she is at home in Buckingham Palace - will now rarely be seen. In her absence, the Union flag flies above the building instead. Her annual calendar usually includes seasonal moves around the UK, but in recent years these have been disrupted by the pandemic. She is expected to resume them this year, spending the summer at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire, Scotland and going to Sandringham in Norfolk from December until mid-February. The plan to move away from London forms part of a long-standing shift, with Windsor Castle and Balmoral always expected to become more important as the monarch entered her 10th decade. While Buckingham Palace contains royal apartments, it is also a government building and may offer less home comforts than the Queen's other residences. This is particularly the case as it undergoes a long-awaited £369 million overhaul of its electrics and plumbing, last replaced in the 1950s. The revamp began in April 2017. Analysis of the Queen's diary in 2015 by The Telegraph showed that she had already dramatically reduced the amount of time she spent at Buckingham Palace. Staff also concentrated her work into fewer days to help conserve her energy. The monarch spent 109 nights there in 2011, dropping to 88 nights in 2015. Nights at Windsor Castle rose from 119 to 159 in the same period. A Royal source said at the time: “There are a lot of events planned to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday in 2016 so it will be a big year, but after that we will see a slight gear change to make things more manageable with a bigger role for other members of the Royal family.” The Balmoral estate in Scotland - long known to be a favourite residence - was also expected to become more important, as it offers her more privacy, peace and space for relaxation than her other homes.",World/The Telegraph,The Queen leaves Buckingham Palace for good as she moves permanently to Windsor Castle,https://news.yahoo.com/queen-leaves-buckingham-palace-good-152003540.html
3/8/2022,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's government said Monday it plans to rush through a new law that will allow it to impose economic sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Unlike many countries that have already introduced sanctions, New Zealand's existing laws don't allow it to apply meaningful measures unless they're part of a broader United Nations effort. Because Russia has U.N. Security Council veto power, that has left New Zealand hamstrung. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the new legislation would allow it to target people, companies and assets connected to those in Russia associated with the invasion, including oligarchs. It would allow New Zealand to freeze assets and stop superyachts or planes from arriving. “A bill of this nature has never been brought before our parliament, but it is essential given Russia’s vetoing of sanctions through the U.N.,” Ardern said. The bill will be specific only to the Ukraine invasion but could allow New Zealand to impose sanctions on countries seen to be helping Russia, such as Belarus. Ardern said there was currently only a small amount of Russian money invested in New Zealand but that without the new law, that could quickly change if Russian oligarchs began viewing New Zealand as a backdoor to avoid sanctions elsewhere. Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said the bill “will send a very clear signal that New Zealand will not be a safe haven for those wishing to move their investments here.” The Russia Sanctions Bill is scheduled to be heard by lawmakers on Wednesday and could pass as quickly as the same day. Ardern said she's hoping it will be supported by lawmakers across all parties although an unanimous vote wasn't guaranteed. “While the legislation is broad, it doesn’t mean that someone who is Russian and wealthy will automatically be a target,"" Mahuta said. New Zealand has already banned exports to Russia's military and security forces. It has also banned more than 100 people from traveling to New Zealand in a list that was made public Monday.

3/8/2022,"Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act passed in 1196 provides social media sites and other internet providers immunity from lawsuits that arise from something posted by a user. It’s been a point of contention ever since the Trump administration asked Congress to strike down the law, even going as far as to veto a $740B defense bill over it. According to NBC News, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas feels the court should look into whether federal law grants social media sites like Facebook broad legal immunity when they are used to commit crimes.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce The Supreme Court declined to take up an appeal from a Texas woman who was friended when she was 15 years old by a man on Facebook who turned out to be a sex trafficker. The lawsuit claims that Facebook should have realized he was a criminal because his posting was full of photos and other content that were clear signs of human trafficking. After she sued Facebook, Texas Supreme Court cited Section 230's immunity provision. Even though the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal, noting the woman’s appeal had technical obstacles that prevented the court from having jurisdiction. Thomas even agreed with this reasoning. However, he feels “the proper scope of social media sites like Facebook having board immunity should be examined.” From NBC News: Thomas said that interpretation of the law is too broad and goes beyond what the statute actually says. Such an expansive reading, he said, results in courts dismissing claims against internet companies for failing to warn consumers of product defects or failing to take reasonable steps to protect users from the malicious activities of other users. This isn’t the first time Judge Thomas has spoken about social media companies and the law. When the Supreme Court dismissed former President Trump’s lawsuit over his Twitter account, Thomas dismissed the case as “moot.” He also had other observations: From NBC News: Justice Thomas said it highlighted a problem, namely that “applying old doctrines to new digital platforms is rarely straightforward.” It seems odd, Thomas said, “to say that something is a government forum when a private company has unrestricted authority to do away with it.”",U.S./The Root,"Chief Justice Clarence Thomas Wants the Supreme Court To Look At Facebook's ""Broad Immunity""",https://news.yahoo.com/chief-justice-clarence-thomas-wants-205533337.html
3/8/2022,"By William James LONDON (Reuters) -British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab described talk of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in its invasion of Ukraine as brinkmanship and rejected President Putin's statement that likened Western sanctions to a declaration of war. A week ago Putin ordered his military command to put Russia's deterrence forces - which include nuclear arms - on high alert, citing what he called aggressive statements by NATO leaders and Western economic sanctions against Moscow. On Sunday, Russian media reported Ukraine was close to building a plutonium-based ""dirty bomb"" nuclear weapon, citing an unidentified source and giving no evidence. ""I think its rhetoric and brinkmanship,"" Raab told Sky News when asked about a possible nuclear escalation by the Kremlin. ""(Putin's) got a track record as long as anyone's arm of misinformation and propaganda ... this is a distraction from what the real issues are at hand - which is that it's an illegal invasion and it is not going according to plan,"" Raab said. He warned the conflict could last for months, if not years, and when asked whether a temporary ceasefire in parts of Ukraine would hold, said he was sceptical about Russian promises. Moscow calls its actions a ""special military operation. It says it wants to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" its pro-Western neighbour and prevent Kyiv from joining NATO. Britain's Chief of Defence Staff stressed that the UK had its own defences and urged a calm response to any talk of nuclear weapons. ""We need to be very clear and we need to be calm and responsible and not react to threats from President Putin,"" Tony Radakin, who is head of Britain's armed forces, told reporters. ""There's an imperative that it doesn't escalate even in conventional terms, and it would be insane for this to start a path towards a nuclear escalation."" Raab rejected Putin's statement from Saturday that likened the West's sanction's to a declaration of war. ""Sanctions are not an act of war, international law is very clear about that,"" he said. ""Our sanctions are entirely both legally justified, but also proportionate to what we're trying to deal with."" Raab also called on China and India to help increase diplomatic pressure on Russia. ""China has got a job here. They've got to step up as well - this is a permanent member of Security Council - and India as well. We need to expand the diplomatic pressure,"" Raab said.

His hopes for indirect control of Ukraine were dashed in 2014's Maidan uprising, so force was his only other option, and ""he also started to believe his own propagandists that Ukraine is run by a Nazi-Bandera junta.""

3/8/2022,"Ken was brought to the emergency department by his wife, Rebecca, who had concerns that he was forgetting things, slurring his speech and having difficulty with his balance. Rebecca told the triage nurse that these symptoms had been going on intermittently for several months. Because the episodes seemed to be occurring more frequently, she called their family physician, who told them to come to the emergency department (ED). The ED was busy the evening they arrived due to patients with injuries related to falls and car crashes because of snowy and ice weather. It took a couple of hours before Ken was able to get a bed. He told his wife that he was tired of waiting and they could come back another day. She refused to let him leave without being evaluated. Dr. Erika Kube: Is there such a thing as drinking too much water? Several of her friends had told her that they thought he was likely developing dementia, which was upsetting because her father had suffered from Alzheimer’s dementia and she remembered how hard it had been on her mother. When I entered the room, Ken looked annoyed to be there. As I asked him what was going on, I paid close attention to how he spoke. I didn't notice any deficits in his speech as he told me that the only reason he was there was because his wife wanted to have him checked out. His wife quickly chimed in that she spoke with his doctor's office about his symptoms and they were concerned enough to send him to the ED. Dr. Erika Kube: Respiratory disease RSV in kids — what are symptoms, why it's rising Over the past several months, Rebecca had noticed that Ken had periods where something seemed off. He appeared confused and had trouble talking at times. She also noticed that he was occasionally off balance while walking and had to hold onto the wall or a chair to keep from falling. These symptoms always seemed to go away, and Ken brushed it off as nothing. Rebecca thought he was developing dementia. I did a detailed neurological exam to see if I could elicit any abnormalities in Ken. He seemed just slightly delayed in answering some questions, but everything else was normal. Rebecca joked that he, of course, didn’t have all the symptoms he had been having while he was in the ED. I asked Ken about his medical history as I simultaneously reviewed his chart and noticed he didn’t have any major medical problems. He said his doctor always gave him a clean bill of health. I asked the nurse to get blood and urine from Ken, and I ordered a CT scan of his brain. I wondered if Rebecca’s concerns about Ken possibly having dementia were right. Dr. Erika Kube: Testicle pain embarrassing to talk about but shouldn't be ignored I was surprised to receive a phone call from the radiologist about an hour later with a critical result. He told me there were numerous masses throughout Ken’s brain consistent with metastatic cancer. He asked if Ken had any history of cancer, which he did not. I took a minute to gather my thoughts before I told Ken and Rebecca what was going on. When I walked in the room Rebecca must have sensed something was wrong as she immediately put her book down, sat straight up and held Ken’s hand. I pulled up Ken’s CT scan images so that I could show them the abnormalities. Ken didn’t say much when I told him that it looked like he had cancer somewhere in his body that had spread to his brain, which had been causing his symptoms over the past few months. He looked at the computer screen with a blank stare. Rebecca was understandably shaken and upset. She kept asking how this was possible since Ken had always been so healthy. I felt so sad for them both as I tried to comfort them. I explained that Ken would need to undergo further evaluation to determine where the cancer had spread from, which would then determine what treatments could be considered for him. Dr. Erika Kube: Did woman's twisted ankle spur rare chronic pain condition? He underwent further imaging that unfortunately found that his primary cancer was in his lung and an MRI of his brain confirmed that he had numerous metastatic lesions. Metastatic spread of the cancer means that cancer cells separate from the primary tumor and travel through the blood stream or lymph system to other parts of the body. Ken was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer, which is the most common type, accounting for approximately 85% of lung cancers. While there are numerous factors that affect survival, in general, the life expectancy after a diagnosis of metastatic brain cancer from the lung is typically poor. Ken met with an oncologist, who advised him that there was not a curative treatment available, but there were several treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy available to him with the goal of helping him to live longer and feel better despite the cancer. Making a diagnosis of cancer in Ken was not what he or I were expecting when he came to the ED that cold winter evening.

3/8/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan may take more action in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine which could significantly impact Japan's energy sector, a senior ruling-party lawmaker said on Sunday, while expressing caution toward a complete end to Russia oil and gas usage. Sanctions against Moscow - such as freezing assets, banning exports of high-tech goods and excluding some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network - are having a major impact, said Hiroshige Seko, upper house secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party. ""What's important above all is to let Russia change action,"" Seko said. ""There's a possibility we may impose further sanctions, which could have ramifications for the energy sector through financial institutions involved with transactions."" ""Sanctions could have a big impact on (Japanese) people's livelihoods, so we would have to seek their understanding for the sake of solidarity with Ukraine,"" Seko told a political debate programme on public broadcaster NHK. Russia's invasion of Ukraine over a week ago has led to a string of big companies halting their businesses in Russia. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". The Japanese government and companies own stakes in oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Russia, including two on Sakhalin Island from which partners Exxon Mobil Corp and Shell PLC have announced they will exit. ""If we exit from Sakhalin 1 and 2 projects, (oil and natural gas) supply would be disrupted while countries like China who are desperate for LNG would get it cheaply,"" Seko said, considering the costs Japan bore developing the projects. ""We must consider it realistically."" Japan decided on Thursday to freeze the assets of four Russian banks from April 2, taking to seven the total number Tokyo has slapped with such sanctions. The government has frozen assets of Russian oligarchs as well as Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko who has backed Russia's invasion. It also decided to ban Belarus-bound exports.

3/8/2022,"Elon Musk has called for Europe to restart dormant nuclear power plants to generate more energy. Musk said he'd prove it's safe by going to a high-radiation area and eating locally grown food on TV. He said he already did so in Japan, shortly after the Fukushima disaster. In a tweet on Sunday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called for Europe to generate more nuclear power to offset fears of a gas shortage. It is ""extremely obvious,"" Musk wrote, that Europe should restart dormant nuclear power plants and boost the output of those that are operational. The tweet — which has been retweeted more than 31,100 times as of press time — drew its fair share of backlash online. ""Until one is mismanaged again and leaks everywhere. That's the risk of more,"" responded Jim Osman, founder of the Edge Consulting Group. Musk, however, claimed the notion of radiation risk is a mistaken one and laid down a challenge to his critics. ""For those who (mistakenly) think this is a radiation risk, pick what you think is the worst location. I will travel there & eat locally grown food on TV,"" he tweeted, adding that he did so in the Japanese prefecture of Fukushima months after its nuclear accident. Musk visited Fukushima in July 2011, according to a press release from SolarCity, which Tesla acquired in 2016. Musk's trip was also reported in Japan's Asahi Shimbun media outlet. Insider was not independently able to verify whether Musk did or did not eat locally grown food, as he claimed. —Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 6, 2022   There have been two major nuclear-plant disasters in history: at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union in 1986, and at Fukushima in 2011. In Chernobyl, children and emergency and recovery workers are at increased risk of negative health effects caused by radiation, but ""the vast majority of the population need not live in fear of serious health consequences,"" said a United Nations assessment of the disaster, released in 2021. Another UN study released in 2021 said it found ""no adverse health effects"" among Fukushima residents directly related to radiation exposure from the accident. Musk's call for more nuclear energy in Europe comes two days after he pushed for a boost in US oil and gas output to counter any decline in Russian supplies. Russian oil exports have fallen by one-third due to sweeping Western sanctions against Russia over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Energy Intelligence reported last Wednesday. Although the sanctions do not specifically target Russian oil and gas exports, there was ""general reluctance among buyers to risk taking Russian cargoes,"" the trade-media outlet reported. The developments have caused oil prices to spike to multiyear highs, sending gas prices at the pump soaring. ""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately,"" Musk said in a tweet on Friday. ""Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.""

In an interview for Amazon's new documentary ""Lucy and Desi,"" Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's daughter Lucie Arnaz provides insight into what things were like for the Arnaz family in 1953, when the Los Angeles Herald-Express accused Ball of being a communist by running the headline ""Lucille Ball a Red"" in red ink. Lucie said in an interview for ""Lucy and Desi"" that her mother ""was scared that people wouldn't believe"" she wasn't really a communist. ""This could destroy everything that they had,"" Lucie recalled in the documentary interview. ""And my father took charge that week."" Ball had classified herself as a member of the communist party when she registered to vote in 1936. Ball's brother Fred said in archive footage shown in the documentary that he and his sister ""did register communist"" in order to ""pacify"" their grandfather, Fredrick Charles Hunt, who raised them and ""was always for the working man."" In 1953, Ball was interviewed by both the FBI and The House Committee on Un-American Activities, which was created so that members of Congress could investigate ""disloyalty to the country by private citizens, public figures and organizations suspected of having fascist or Communist ties,"" according to The Wrap. ""They interviewed her about it at great length and they cleared her,"" Lucie said in the documentary about her mother's experience with The House Committee on Un-American Activities. But that didn't stop the Los Angeles Herald-Express from running their ""Lucille Ball a Red"" headline. Lucie, who was only about two years old at the time, said Arnaz took matters into his own hands to protect his wife. ""He invited all the press into our house and he told them exactly what my mother had done, that she had never been involved in the communist party,"" Lucie said. Arnaz actually took clearing his wife's name to an extra level, as depicted in Aaron Sorkin's 2021 film, ""Being the Ricardos."" He invited members of the press to a live taping of an episode of ""I Love Lucy"" and got the director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover ""on the phone,"" Lucie said in the new documentary. Lucie recalled Hoover telling Arnaz over the phone, in earshot of the studio audience, ""Your wife is cleared of any charges. 100 percent clear."" Arnaz then introduced Ball to the audience, and according to Lucie, her father delivered one of his most famous lines then: ""The only thing red about her was her hair, and even that was not legitimate.""

3/8/2022,"(Adds quotes, details) LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin warned Ukraine on Sunday that Russia's military operation would only be halted if Kyiv stopped resisting and fulfilled all of the Kremlin's demands. Putin told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan by telephone that Ukraine's negotiators should take a more ""constructive"" approach at talks with Moscow to take into account the reality on the ground. Putin, whose comments were published in a Kremlin readout of the call, said his ""special operation"" in Ukraine was going according to plan and to schedule. ""It was underlined that the suspension of the special operation is only possible if Kyiv stops military operations and carries out well-known Russian demands,"" the Kremlin said. Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, calls its actions in its former Soviet neighbour a ""special operation"" that seeks to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities, purge the country of what it says are nationalists and make it a neutral state. The Kremlin leader told Erdogan that Moscow was open to dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities, but that he hoped Ukrainian negotiators would take a more constructive approach at the next round of talks. ""...attention was drawn to the futility of any attempts to drag out the negotiation process, which is being used by the Ukrainian security forces to regroup their forces and resources.

3/8/2022,"Mar. 6—A Common Pleas Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by an ex-Dayton police officer who was fired for dishonesty. Tonina Lamanna, a former police sergeant and K-9 handler, sued the city of Dayton alleging violation of due process, negligent supervision, defamation, retaliation and other wrongdoing. The court granted judgment in favor of the defendant and dismissed the plaintiff's claim, said John Musto, Dayton's deputy law director, who declined further comment. Lamanna claimed in a lawsuit in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court that the city put her on a ""Brady List"" without notifying her or allowing her to contest the decision. The city's Brady List includes the names of police officers who were fired or resigned while facing termination after being accused of falsification or being untruthful. Lamanna was fired after allegedly lying about accessing personnel records in a police records system. She claimed that her name's inclusion on the list was unfair and violated due process and prevented her from finding work in her field. Last month, Montgomery County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Krumholtz sustained the city's request for summary judgment in the case. He wrote that it was clear to the court that Lamanna could not prevail in any of her legal claims. The case will be dismissed until Lamanna appeals the decision.","U.S./Dayton Daily News, Ohio","Ex-Dayton cop loses lawsuit over dishonesty, 'Brady List'",https://news.yahoo.com/ex-dayton-cop-loses-lawsuit-194300386.html
3/8/2022,"Andria Devlin, 47, was shocked to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer five years ago. The early childhood educator had no risk factors and no family history of the disease. Like many people, she put off getting her symptoms checked out when they appeared. Devlin, who lives in Lawrence, Kansas, shared her story with TODAY. This is not an easy topic to talk about, but it's so important. People should not die from embarrassment, and I think people are dying because they don’t want to go to their doctor and talk about the symptoms. It took me a long time to go in and say something is not right. I have always been a human who has lived more on the constipated side, so irregular bowel movements have been kind of my jam for forever. In 2016, I noticed mucuosy substances in my stool. It was different, but not concerning. Then I started having intermittent bleeding with my bowel movements. That, in conjunction with my constipation, equaled hemorrhoids in my brain. I had no stomach issues, no weight loss, no fatigue and all of my labs looked fine. There was nothing that would indicate that I had a tumor growing in my rectum, other than the constipation and the bright red blood in my stool. I hadn’t given much thought to colorectal cancer. Why would I? I was in my early 40s, I’m active, I exercise, I eat well, I don’t smoke. There were absolutely no risk factors and no family history that would make me think, ""Oh, you probably have cancer."" That’s why it took me way too long to go to the doctor. It took getting to the point where I was bleeding every time I had a bowel movement for me to just be tired of it. I remember mentioning it to my OB, who said to get it checked out. Video: Black Health nonprofit encourages screenings for colorectal cancer A group called Black Health is working to educate people about the risks of colorectal cancer and urging people to get screened at any early age. Their focus on colorectal cancer came after the death of Chadwick Boseman at the age of 43, and also after a study came through that there was an increase of cases in the Black community. TODAY’s Craig Melvin reports and spreads awareness on colorectal cancer. That was in May 2016, but I didn’t go to the doctor until January 2017. She did a rectal exam and didn’t feel any hemorrhoids, but gave me a suppository substance see if that would help. It slowed the bleeding down, but it did not stop it. I was then scheduled for a colonoscopy. I remember waking up from that and hearing the doctors say, “We found something very low in your rectum. It’s pretty ugly tissue.” My dad died of esophageal cancer, so when someone says ugly tissue, I know what that looks like. There were photos along with the colonoscopy report and it was certainly not the bright pink, healthy, happy tissue that you imagine that your insides look like. The doctor called the next day, which happened to be my child’s 15th birthday, and told me the tissue was cancerous. The tumor was significant, blocking 80 to 85% of my rectum. I was immediately sent to oncology at Lawrence Memorial Hospital. Scans revealed it was stage 4 colorectal cancer — it had spread beyond my rectum to both my lungs. I was in chemo treatments within two weeks of learning my diagnosis. Ultimately, the chemo took care of almost all of the cancer in my lungs and it shrunk the tumor. I had a rectal resection in August 2017. But there was a spot in my right lung that didn’t get smaller, it just stayed. A subsequent scan showed that it grew just a tiny bit. I had stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on that spot in February of 2018 — five sessions over five days. You don’t move during this therapy — they make a mold of your body so you lay in a very specific position every single time. I have two boys so I liked to think about “Star Wars” while the machine was doing its thing — like “pew pew” lasers zapping my cancer spot. In January of 2020, I had a scan that revealed another spot in that right lung, so I went through another round of SBRT. Today, I am just celebrating the fact that I am still alive. It’s pretty miraculous that someone with stage 4 colorectal cancer can say that at five years. I am still having clear scans right now. Cancer had already impacted our family and when that happens, there is a shift because life is precious and you don’t really recognize that until you have a life-altering diagnosis. When I was first diagnosed, I thought, ""You have to see your oldest kid graduate from high school."" So I’ve been just checking these boxes. My next checkbox is in May — my younger son is graduating from high school, so that’s what I’m going for. I’ll keep adding checkboxes to my list, like college graduations. I’m just making lots of memories and raising awareness. People don’t want to go to the doctor and say, “I’ve got mucus in my poop. What’s that about?” But people should not die from embarrassment. If I can talk about my experience and that gets one person to the doctor before I went to the doctor, I have done my job.

3/8/2022,"A former foreign minister in the Kremlin has said Vladimir Putin isn't insane and will not intentionally use nuclear weapons against the West. Andrei Kozyrev, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1996, said Putin is ""rational"" and is acting on misguided information from his own military, rather than being hellbent on destroying the West. He tweeted that the view among some in the West that Putin is being ""irrational"" in his decision to invade Ukraine is not accurate. He said: ""I disagree. It’s horrific, but not irrational."" Instead, Kozyrev argues, Putin has been convinced by his own advisers and propaganda machine that Ukraine is being run by Nazis, and that the West has been behind Kyiv wanting to grow further away from the influence of the Kremlin. Read more: Russia 'drops cluster bombs on civilian houses and Ukrainian zoo' He has also believed the mistruths fed to him by corrupt Russian military officials, Kozyrev added. ""The Kremlin spent the last 20 years trying to modernise its military,"" he said, ""Much of that budget was stolen and spent on mega-yachts in Cyprus. But as a military advisor you cannot report that to the President. So they reported lies to him instead."" The way the West had dealt with Russia in the past led to Putin's belief they were ""toothless"", and wouldn't fight back, he said. Instead, Moscow has had to contend with swingeing sanctions imposed by the UK, US, Canada and the EU, including sweeping sanctions against Putin himself, his ministers, oligarchs, individuals close to the Kremlin, banks, and key businesses. Russia’s economy has also come under immense pressure from the international sanctions, with the rouble dropping to its lowest-ever value, weakening to 133.5 to the dollar -s a 40% drop in value compared to before the invasion. ""He miscalculated on all three, but that doesn’t make him insane. Simply wrong and immoral,"" Kozyrev said. Read more: Russia says military action will stop immediately if Ukraine agrees to four conditions It is widely believed that Russia's invasion has not gone to plan, with Putin left angry and frustrated by the slow progress made by his forces in the opening days of the conflict. Russia has since stoked fears of a nuclear conflict with the West, with Putin putting Moscow's nuclear forces on ""high alert"", and conducting submarine drills in the Black Sea. Moscow's current foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, further fanned the flames further last week, saying a world war sparked by the current crisis ""will become nuclear"". Despite this, Kozyrev has insisted Putin is simply using the nuclear threat as his ""last remaining card in the deck"" to extract concessions from Ukraine and the West. Watch: Boris Johnson says ""nothing is off the table"" when it comes to sanctions on Russia ""In my opinion, he is rational. Given that he is rational, I strongly believe he will not intentionally use nuclear weapons against the West. I say intentionally because indiscriminate shelling near a nuclear power plant can cause an unintentional nuclear disaster in Ukraine."" The invasion of Ukraine has shown no signs of stopping, with Putin facing accusations of war crimes and of indiscriminately bombing civilian men, women and children. Even after agreeing a ceasefire so civilians could be evacuated, so-called safe routes were shelled by Russian forces in Irpin on Sunday, killing civilians who were trying to flee to safety.  Putin's invasion has triggered the worst refugee crisis since World War Two, displacing around 1.5 million people.

3/8/2022,"Kytch, a startup using technology to control ice cream machines, is suing McDonald's. The complaint accuses the chain of false advertising and interference in its customer contracts. McDonald's is alleged to have emailed franchisees saying Kytch devices violated machine warranties. McDonald's is being sued for $900 million by a startup, which created a device it said was designed to fix the chain's ice cream machines. In a lawsuit filed by Kytch on March 1, McDonald's is accused of having sent emails to franchisees saying that Kytch devices violated the machines' warranties and intercepted their confidential information. McDonald's also claimed that the device could pose a safety threat and potentially cause injuries. Kytch, which provides remote controls, maintenance, and other tools for ice cream machines, describes both claims as false and defamatory. Its lawsuit is also critical of Taylor Company, which is the chain's main provider of ice cream machines. Kytch's co-founders, Melissa Nelson and Jeremy O'Sullivan, are seeking $900 million in damages and as well as defamation, have accused McDonald's of false advertising and interference in its contracts with customers, per the lawsuit. In a statement sent to Insider, McDonald's said it ""owes it to our customers, crew, and franchisees to maintain our rigorous safety standards and work with fully vetted suppliers in that pursuit. Kytch's claims are meritless, and we'll respond to the complaint accordingly."" After learning that Kytch's unauthorized device was being used at some McDonald's restaurants, the fast-food chain said it sent a warning to franchisees regarding the possibility of crew or maintenance staff being injured. This was due to the remote-operating system Kytch enables in their soft-serve machines, the company said. McDonald's said that the safety certifications mentioned in Kytch's complaint do not meet the robust requirements the chain has for all equipment in its restaurants. According to McDonald's, there were many different scenarios that could result in possible injury, which it said that Kytch had not addressed. In a statement, Kytch's founders told Insider that McDonald's has ""destroyed"" its business,"" and that ""nothing can undo that damage."" O'Sullivan and Nelson added in the statement: ""McDonald's worked closely with its soft-serve machine manufacturer, Taylor Company, to spread false information about our company, to drive us out of the marketplace, and to line their own pockets."" According to McBroken, a website tracking the chain's broken ice cream machines, 12.57% of machines are currently out of use, with 36.73% not working in New York. Despite the reportedly widespread issues surrounding ice cream machines, ""McDonald's has failed to meaningfully improve the machines, and the fast-food giant has even granted Taylor exclusive rights to supply kitchen appliances to more than 13,000 retail locations in the United States,"" the lawsuit alleged. It added: ""This arrangement generates millions of dollars of revenue for Taylor and its network of franchised distributors.""  In September last year, Insider's Mary Meisenzahl reported that McDonald's frequently broken ice cream machines were under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The chain countered this claim by saying it had no reason to think it was under investigation. O'Sullivan told Newsweek: ""If their mission was to destroy Kytch, they absolutely succeeded. What has blown up in their face is this massive trail of really damning evidence of all the laws they've broken."" He added that it took him and Nelson months, ""if not a full year,"" to gather all the evidence and data, and ""convince very smart attorneys to take this data and litigate it against probably the most fearsome company to sue, which is McDonald's.""

You even had national security concerns,"" Guthrie said to Barr during his first live television interview since leaving Trump's administration. ""None of this is present in this resignation letter.

Barr responded by saying he tendered his resignation on Dec. 14, a date by which the 2020 election was already ""over for all intents and purposes."" In the weeks following the election, Trump and his allies repeatedly floated unproven theories of widespread voter fraud, assertions Barr writes in his forthcoming book he told the president were ""bullshit."" ""The idea that something could be done later on Jan. 6 was nonsense,"" Barr told Guthrie. ""Once the election was locked in on Dec. 14, I tendered my resignation and I knew Trump was going to be leaving office.""

In a letter responding to a request for comment on Barr's remarks from NBC News over the weekend, Trump said his former attorney general is ""groveling for the media, hoping to gain acceptance that he doesn't deserve."" Guthrie asked Barr about Trump's response, saying critics might suggest the former attorney general is on ""an image rehab tour with a lawyerly flair."" ""People who know me know I don't care much about what people think of me,"" Barr responded. ""I think that's one of the reasons I was persuaded to take the attorney general job because I wasn't looking for anything. I don't have a future career. I'm retired and I felt I could just call them as I see them."" Trump has himself clashed with Guthrie in the past.

3/8/2022,"Russia has issued a list of demands for Ukraine to follow if its invasion is to come to an end. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave Moscow's most explicit statement so far of the terms it wants to impose on Ukraine to halt its ""special military operation"", which is now in its 12th day. Pesko said Ukraine must: Cease military action Change its constitution to enshrine neutrality Acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory Recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent territories. The outlining of Russia’s demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks. Peskov said that, if those conditions are met, Russia's military action will halt ""in a moment"". He added: ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc. This is possible only by making changes to the constitution."" He also insisted Russia was not seeking to make any further territorial claims on Ukraine. Peskov said the Ukraine was aware of the conditions, adding that they were told ""that all this can be stopped in a moment."" ""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. ""We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognize that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And that’s it. It will stop in a moment."" It is not yet clear how receptive the Ukrainian government will be to the demands. By changing its constitution to enshrine neutrality, Ukraine would be unable to join Nato - a key move the Kremlin is keen to ensure. Ukraine has been keen to join the EU, with leaders from the bloc meeting this week to discuss Zelenskyy's bid to join this week. The chairman of EU summits Charles Michel tweeted on Monday: ""The EU's solidarity, friendship and unprecedented assistance for Ukraine are unwavering. We will discuss Ukraine's membership application in coming days."" Watch: Zelenskyy calls for harsher Russian sanctions Vladimir Putin reportedly thought his invasion would take a matter of days, but was met with a strong resistance from Ukrainian Armed Forces and civilians. Boris Johnson said on Monday that Russia's invasion breaches Ukrainian sovereignty. The prime minister said Putin's recognition of the independence of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine is ""a repudiation of the Minsk process and the Minsk agreements."" Speaking at Downing Street, Johnson said the UK ""will continue to do everything we can to stand by the people of Ukraine with a very robust package of sanctions."" ""They will be triggered with the first toecap of a Russian incursion or Russian invasion. But plainly what has happened is extremely bad news. ""We will be urgently talking to our friends and allies around the world, all of whom are jointly signed up with us in this package of sanctions."" On Wednesday, Russia admitted for the first time admitted it had suffered heavy losses, saying in a statement 498 of its troops had died. The UK has the death toll will be “considerably higher” than figures released by the Kremlin. The United Nations has opposed any Russian claim to Donetsk and Lugansk and it has also condemned the annexation of Crime by Moscow in 2014. Russia has increasingly been seen by the international community as a ""global pariah"" following the invasion on 24 February.

The outlining of Russia's demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks aimed at ending Russia’s war against Ukraine.

Russia agreed to a ceasefire over the weekend so people could be evacuated from their homes. Attempts at an evacuation in Mariupol were stopped on Sunday after men, women, and children were targeted with shells as they tried to flee.

Russians, go f— yourselves!” We immediately recognised the warship quote, first spoken by a group of Ukrainian border guards as they refused to surrender an island on the first day of the Russian invasion. It has since become a rallying cry against Moscow. Since the invasion started almost two weeks ago, more than 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled to central Europe and further afield in a desperate escape from Russian bombs. But tens of thousands of Russians - most of them well-educated, urban and with an international outlook - have now fled Vladimir Putin’s regime and what appears to be an imminent new Iron Curtain.

While some locals are less than welcoming to the new arrivals, many Russians - myself included - felt we had no choice. An avalanche of international sanctions threaten to plunge millions into poverty and make Russia an international pariah on a par with North Korea. A draconian new law that means anyone who contradicts the official Kremlin line on the conflict can face 15 years in jail has led to an exodus of journalists. Persistent rumours about the impending introduction of martial law, which could lead to enforced conscription, has made escape even more pressing for men of fighting age. Within days from the start of the conflict, all the plane tickets out of the country had been snapped up as the West moved to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Some Russians made the journey across the border into Europe on foot. I was lucky and managed to fly to Tbilisi, with an overnight stopover in Istanbul. In Turkey, I went to meet a local friend at a bar in a 19th-century palazzo, where I immediately bumped into two Moscow acquaintances. They work, or used to work, at two of Moscow’s best-known cultural institutions. The glitzy headquarters of both organisations still stand in Moscow, but all of their operations have been suspended. Russia has become too toxic to play any role in international culture. Both of my friends, Western-educated men aged in their 30s, spoke of paralysing fear when clearing passport control in Moscow. A number of travellers have been questioned by border guards and asked to unlock their phones. Both men had deleted their chats and any applications that might have marked them out as opposition-minded. One of them installed an app for the Kremlin outlet RT as a decoy. “Anything you say is a treason in Russia right now,” one of the men said. The Russia we knew no longer exists. Vladimir Putin’s war-era Russia has no time for designers, artists and IT developers - or anyone else with a global outlook. The talk on the streets of Istanbul and Tbilisi is all about where to go, where to settle. The influx of educated Russians desperate to escape has drawn comparison to the exodus of White Russian emigres who fled from Bolsheviks after Russia’s Civil War, more than a century ago. The White Russians - named after the anti-Bolshevik White Army and counting Vladimir Nabokov, the novelist, and Igor Stravinsky, the composer, among their members - settled across the globe, leaving behind lasting cultural heritage. As we sat in that Istanbul club, talking about the ins and outs of getting a residence permit in Turkey, a tall man in a baseball cap and swanky glasses walked into the room. It was Kirill Serebrennikov, Russia’s most sought-after film and theatre director. The new emigres that I met in Istanbul and Tbilisi were overwhelmingly in their 30s and 40s, with transferable skills, whether these be in technology or film. At least 25,000 Russians travelled to Georgia last week alone, Levan Davitashvili, a Georgian deputy prime minister, said on Monday. His country was open to this new skilled labour, he said. Tbilisi’s hotels and guest houses are fully booked this week and Russian speakers outnumber locals at many cafes and shops. As I went down for breakfast at my hotel in Tbilisi on Sunday morning, I saw a room full of Russians - young, polite couples with their dogs and children, all looking confused and sad. One floor up, you could hear a woman crying out at the top of her voice, cursing Putin for destroying her life. At the weekend, Visa and MasterCard announced they were suspending operations for Russia. But in a cruel twist, it turned out that the ban will only affect those using Russian-issued cards outside the country. The 72 per cent of Russians who never travel abroad - incidentally, roughly the same proportion of Russians that support Putin - will not be affected. Those who have fled or want to visit the West will be punished. In the queue where we were told to “go f—” ourselves in Tbilisi, we were desperately trying to withdraw dollars before our bank cards turned into useless pieces of plastic. On Monday, they did - turning successful professionals into paupers overnight, although I hope only temporarily. I, for one, had to face the wrath of a taxi driver who could not get his ride fare from my Russian account, because it had been blocked as I was in his car. My countrymen in Georgia whispered to each other about a major bank that was asking new Russian clients to sign a form stating that they opposed the Kremlin’s aggression in Ukraine, as well as Moscow’s occupation of Georgia’s breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. A central branch of that bank was besieged by anxious Russian men and women filling in the forms as soon as it opened on Monday morning.",World/The Telegraph,Russia’s impending doom of censorship and sanctions meant I had no choice but to flee,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-impending-doom-censorship-sanctions-170210343.html
3/8/2022,"Ukrainian actor Pasha Lee was killed on Sunday, March 6 in Irpin, Ukraine, while fighting Russian military forces as they invaded his homeland. He was 33. The Odesa International Film Festival confirmed the actor's death through an Instagram post on March 6 writing that Lee was killed as a ""result of shelling by Russian occupiers in the Ukrainian city of Irpin."" The film festival revealed that Lee had joined the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine last week ""to protect the country from Russian occupiers"" during the ongoing invasion. The OIFF called on the ""world community to help Ukraine in the fight against Russia and stop the war"" by joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for NATO to impose a no-fly zone over the Eastern European country to counter Russian military aircrafts. Following the news of Lee's death, Ukrainian actress Anastasiya Kasilova—who starred alongside the actor in the 2021 TV drama Provincial—took to Facebook to mourn her co-star's death. SNL Pays Solemn Tribute to the People of War-Torn Ukraine ""Pasha Li killed during the shelling in Irpen, defending Ukraine,"" she wrote on March 6. ""He is an actor, TV presenter, my colleague and a good acquaintance… Not so long ago we shot together in a teaser for a children's film… Never forgive!"" Lee starred in several films and television shows, including Selfie Party, Shtolnya, Shadows of Unforgotten Ancestors, Zvychayna Sprava, The Fight Rules, Meeting of Classmates and more. He also did dubbing work for The Hobbit and The Lion King. One day before his death, Lee took to Instagram to share a photo of himself in military uniform. He captioned the post, ""For the last 48 hours there is an opportunity to sit down and take a picture of how we are being bombed, and we are smiling because we will manage and everything will be UKRAINE WE ARE WORKING !!!""

3/8/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Carlos Barria LVIV/IRPIN, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian officials said a Russian air strike hit a bread factory in northern Ukraine on Monday, killing at least 13 civilians, while talks between Kyiv and Moscow made little progress towards easing the conflict. The strike on the factory in Makariv, just west of the capital Kyiv, took place as the number of refugees fleeing across borders from the Russian assault on Ukraine passed 1.7 million, according to United Nations figures. Russian forces pressed on with their seiges and bombing of Ukrainian cities on the 11th day of the war. In the encircled southern port city of Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of people remained trapped without food and water under regular bombardments. ""They're bombing the life out of everything that is moving,"" Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Reuters was not able to verify the reported bakery attack but local emergency services said the bodies of at least 13 civilians were recovered from rubble after it was hit. Five people were rescued of the 30 believed to have been there at the time. Russia denies targeting civilians. Zelenskiy, speaking on a zoom call with a Jewish group in the United States, said: ""The bakery was eliminated. And this is happening in different cities."" In the eastern city of Kharkiv, police said a further 10 people had been killed over the past day, taking the total death toll there from Russian bombardment to 143 since the start of the invasion. It was not possible to verify the toll. After the third attempt to ease the bloodshed at talks in Belarus, a Ukrainian negotiator said that although small progress on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians had been made, things remained largely unchanged. ""As of now, there are no results that significantly improve the situation,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video statement, while Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky, told journalists the talks were ""not easy"". ""We hope that from tomorrow these corridors will finally work,"" he said. A fourth round of talks will take place very soon, Russian negotiator Leonid Slutsky told Russian state television. Russia had offered Ukrainians escape routes to Russia and Belarus, its close ally, early on Monday after weekend evacuation ceasefire attempts failed. A spokesperson for Zelenskiy said the Russian proposal was ""completely immoral"". The day before, Reuters journalists had witnessed people trying to flee the town of Irpin near Kyiv getting caught in Russian shelling. On Monday people picked their way over the twisted ruins of a large bridge in Irpin, with river water rushing just beneath them. ""It's like a disaster. The city is almost ruined and the district where I'm living (there are) no houses which were not bombed,"" a young woman leaving with her children told Reuters. Russia calls the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and remove leaders it describes as neo-Nazis. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a transparent pretext for an invasion to conquer a nation of 44 million people. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters Moscow would halt operations if Ukraine ceased fighting, amended its constitution to declare neutrality, and recognised Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of regions held by Russian-backed separatists. OIL BAN MULLED Western nations have placed heavy sanctions on Moscow to isolate it from global commerce and are now considering banning Russian oil imports. Oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008 amid the prospect of less supply from Russia, the world's biggest exporter of oil and gas. International businesses and sports bodies have suspended ties, and wider economic disruption is likely as Russia and Ukraine are both among the world's main exporters of food and industrial metals. Prices of nickel, which is used to make stainless steel and batteries for electric vehicles, surged about 60% on Monday and have now nearly doubled since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said Russian forces were ""beginning to accumulate resources for the storming of Kyiv"", a city of more than 3 million, after days of slow progress in their main advance south from Belarus. In Mariupol, deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said there had been continuous air raids overnight. Orlov told CNN authorities were ready to evacuate 6,000 people on Saturday but the Russians had bombed 29 big municipal buses that were to transport them. Moscow has accused the Ukrainians of blocking the planned evacuations. The U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, Michael Carpenter, told a meeting of its 57 participating states that Russia had bombed agreed evacuation routes out of Volnovakha and Mariupol just as civilians were fleeing. ""It is pure evil,"" he said. Ukraine said on Monday its forces had retaken control of the town of Chuhuiv in the northeast after heavy fighting and of the strategic Mykolayiv airport in the south, which the regional governor said was under tank fire. Neither claim could immediately be verified. In a humanitarian update the United Nations described one psychiatric hospital 60 km (40 miles)from Kyiv running out of water and medicine with 670 people trapped inside, including bedridden patients with severe needs. The World Health Organization said at least nine people had been confirmed killed in 16 attacks on health care facilitaties since the start of the war. PICK UP PACE A senior U.S. defence official said Putin had now deployed into Ukraine nearly 100% of the more than 150,000 forces that he had pre-staged outside the country before the invasion. An analyst with Britain's Royal United Services Institute, Ed Arnold, said Russia would need to try to consolidate the gains it has already made and pause to mobilise more forces unless the pace of its assault picked up. Moscow has acknowledged nearly 500 deaths among its soldiers, but Western countries say the true number is much higher and Ukraine says it is many thousands. Death tolls cannot be verified, but footage filmed across Ukraine shows burnt-out wreckage of Russian tanks and armour, and parts of Ukrainian cities reduced to rubble by Russian strikes.
