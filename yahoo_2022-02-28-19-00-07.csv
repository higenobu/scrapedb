2/28/2022,"Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, says Putin is becoming ""increasingly unhinged."" ""He's out at his compound, doesn't come into town very much, and under Covid, he's been more isolated,"" he said. McFaul added in a tweet that Putin might be disconnected from reality after decades in power. A former US ambassador to Russia said Sunday that, after decades in power and intense isolation from COVID-19, Russian President Vladimir Putin is becoming ""increasingly unhinged."" Michael McFaul, an Obama-era ambassador to Russia, made the observation during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" When asked if Putin was a ""rational actor,"" McFaul said: ""To get kicked out of SWIFT as it happened to Russia yesterday, and then to have the president of Russia get in front of his generals and say 'We need to prepare for nuclear war.' That doesn't sound very rational to me."" On Saturday, Western nations announced that some Russian banks would be removed from SWIFT, a global financial messaging system. McFaul, who said he first met Putin in 1991, expressed concern that the Russian leader has believed his own propaganda ""for decades."" ""Remember, this guy's been in power for 22 years. He doesn't listen to his aides. Even when I was ambassador eight years ago, he was very dismissive of anybody around him. He's out at his compound, doesn't come into town very much, and, under Covid, he's been more isolated,"" McFaul said. ""I sat in the room with him for five years when I worked in the Obama administration. I speak Russian. I listened to him, and I know what he says — he's increasingly unhinged in the way that he talks about the regime,"" McFaul added. The former ambassador also highlighted Putin's claims that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky — a Jewish man — is a neo-Nazi and a drug addict. ""That doesn't sound like somebody who's going to sit down and negotiate a peaceful outcome,"" said McFaul, referring to Putin. In a separate tweet on Monday, McFaul reiterated why he thought dictators like Putin couldn't be reasoned with. ""When dictators rule for decades, they (1) stop listening to advisors, (2) become disconnected from reality, (3) spend a lot of time alone, and (4) overreach. This is exactly what has happened to Putin,"" McFaul wrote. Early on Thursday morning, Putin announced a surprise military assault on Ukraine, claiming that he wanted to ""demilitarize and de-Nazify"" the country.

2/28/2022,"SOFIA (Reuters) -Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said on Monday he would sack Defence Minister Stefan Yanev after Yanev's reluctance to describe the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a war prompted calls for his removal. Petkov said the centrist coalition government will have a meeting later on Monday to vote on Yanev's dismissal, when he would also propose a new defence minister. Petkov said all coalition partners have agreed to Yanev's sacking. ""My defence minister cannot use the word operation instead of the word war. You cannot call it an operation when thousands of soldiers from the one and the other side are already killed,"" Petkov said in a televised statement. ""The Bulgarian interest is not in bending our heads down...When we see something we do not agree with, something so obvious, we cannot keep quiet,"" Petkov said. In a Facebook post late on Sunday Yanev wrote that he was the subject of a targeted attack aimed at replacing him with someone who would be more open to taking decisions that serve foreign interests, which could put Bulgaria's security at risk. Petkov slammed Yanev's statement saying neither of his ministers had the right for ""their own foreign policy, especially on Facebook"" nor to believe that their staying in office is directly linked to the stability of the government. Petkov said European Union and NATO member Bulgaria is not forced to take any decisions by its Western allies but stressed that the biggest guarantee for the Black Sea country's security lies in standing united with its European Union peers. In December, Petkov was forced to explain that Bulgaria has not yet discussed deployment of NATO troops in the country in response to the build up of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border after Yanev posted on Facebook that he believed such troops were not needed.
