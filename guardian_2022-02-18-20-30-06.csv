2/18/2022,"Aston Villa will expect to beat a Watford side adrift in the relegation zone and without a win in 11 matches. Roy Hodgson’s side have also rather alarmingly failed to score in their past four matches, the last three of which Hodgson has presided over. No new manager bounce to speak of then but Ismaïla Sarr’s rest after Afcon and hopeful return to the starting lineup might give Villa’s Emiliano Martínez a challenge. Steven Gerrard’s side have been inconsistent all season and he will surely want Villa to flex their superior quality to pick up a much-needed win. They are unlikely to drop as low as a fight to save their season but Villa should be aiming higher than current form has them.

2/18/2022,"From Zorro’s mask to Rocky’s shorts, and from Madonna’s conical bra to Ringo Starr’s papal attire in the 1975 musical Lisztomania, some of the many costumes that have stitched together the worlds of film and fashion have gone on show in a Madrid exhibition overseen by Jean Paul Gaultier. The enfant terrible of French fashion, now silver-haired and a couple of months shy of 70, says the idea is to look at how the two creative spheres have fed and influenced each other while simultaneously serving as mirrors of social, sexual and cultural change.  His show, simply titled Cine y Moda (Cinema and Fashion), is a joint project between La Cinémathèque Française and Spain’s La Caixa Foundation. In five thematic sections and through 100 garments, 90 film clips and 125 posters, stills, sketches and photographs, male and female archetypes are constructed, celebrated, questioned and deconstructed. “I think that fashion shows represent life and society – and the evolution of society – and so does cinema,” Gaultier said at the launch on Thursday. “In this exhibition, you can see how, little by little, fashion and film reflect what’s going on in society and how the world is evolving. You can see what’s going on and how men and women are evolving.” Two films occupy a central place in the show’s examination of the interplay between the two art forms. The first is Jacques Becker’s 1945 melodrama Falbalas, also known as Paris Frills. Set in a couture house, the film inspired Gaultier to enter the world of fashion when he saw it at the age of 13. The second is Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?, William Klein’s fashion industry satire from 1966. Most of the items on display will be rather more familiar to visitors. The costume Christopher Reeve wore in Superman IV is there, as is Dolph Lundgren’s minimal, belty He-Man get-up from Masters of the Universe. The dress, jacket and pumps worn by Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct’s infamous interrogation scene put in an appearance, and so does the famous conical bra Gaultier designed for Madonna’s Blonde Ambition tour. The designer’s explanation, printed alongside the bra, speaks for itself: “My conical breasts are almost an erotic aggression and paradoxically an armature that protects her at the same time; it is a woman who ‘harasses’ with her breasts.” The show also takes in Gaultier’s collaborations with directors as diverse as Pedro Almodóvar and Luc Besson. The Frenchman said he had been a fan of Almodóvar long before the director suggested they work together. “He showed women and La Movida [Spain’s post-Franco 1980s counter-cultural movement] and that spirit of freedom that we also saw in Paris,” said Gaultier. “He showed women not as objects but as strong women with character, like Rossy de Palma and Victoria Abril.” His influence on the look of Besson’s The Fifth Element is illustrated by his sketches for the costumes worn by Bruce Willis and Chris Tucker. Elsewhere are dresses worn by Catherine Deneuve and Fanny Ardant in François Ozon’s 8 Women, a cockerel-adorned biker jacket that pays homage to Marlon Brando’s iconic original from The Wild One, and Gaultier’s take on Alex’s bowler hat and overalls from A Clockwork Orange. Elisa Durán, deputy general director of La Caixa Foundation, described the exhibition as a celebration of the symbiosis between two artistic worlds. “This is about the attraction that fashion’s always held for cinema, and about the attraction that the cinema’s always held for fashion,” she said. “This world of models and shows and the creations of great designers has been a source of inspiration for cinema almost since its origins.” Gaultier, whose passion for film and fashion remains boundless, said his celluloid escapades had been both enjoyable and instructive. “The first thing I learned was that I could never make a film because it’s such a difficult job,” he said. “Even if you have a visual or aesthetic sense, you have to direct the actors and worry about the story.” Cine y Moda is at the CaixaForum in Madrid until 5 June 2022",Lifestyle/Fashion,Rocky’s shorts and Madonna’s bra on display in Madrid at Gaultier show,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/18/rocky-shorts-and-madonna-bra-show-madrid-gaultier-cine-y-moda
2/18/2022,"Until recently, the US-born freestyle skier Eileen Gu – or Gu Ailing as she is known in China – was one of the rising numbers of Chinese Americans straddling the two countries. Many are comfortable operating between the two cultures and systems, taking pride in their heritage as well as their upbringing. Gu, now 18, was born in San Francisco to an American father and a Chinese mother. She’s a big fan of Chinese dumplings and, every summer, she flew back to Beijing to attend cram school for mathematics. “When I’m in China, I’m Chinese and when I go to America, I’m American,” the she once said.  But as the geopolitical mood between China and America began to shift, Gu was also caught in the middle between nationalism, identity and loyalty on both sides of the Pacific. While she was lauded in China, for which she has won three Olympic medals, she was denounced by a Fox News analyst as “ungrateful”, saying that her “reverse migration” was “shameful”. In 2019, Gu switched her sport allegiance from the US to China. She said at the time: “The opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mum was born, during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help promote the sport I love.” Since early this year, questions have been repeatedly raised about her citizenship. China does not recognise dual nationals, and under Rule 41 of the Olympic charter, Gu must be a Chinese citizen in order to compete for the country. And if this is the case, analysts say, she would not be able to retain a US passport simultaneously. In recent months, as Beijing doubles down its promotion of Chinese identity, it has required its broadcasters to scrutinise the citizenships of celebrities who are active in mainland China. This move has resulted in some high-profile actors renouncing their non-Chinese nationalities. Gu has always dodged the question about her citizenship in public. In response to a Guardian question about her critics, she replied: “I’m an 18-year-old out here living my best life. I’m not going to waste my time trying to placate people who are uneducated, and don’t experience the gratitude and love I have on a daily basis.” Her answer won her rounds of applause on Chinese social media. Nationalists praised Gu for her ability to speak both languages fluently and showing her standout intellect so elegantly. The official China Daily newspaper said her response to her critics should be given “full marks”. In China, Gu is a symbol of national pride and the face of almost a dozen brands and products. They range from China Mobile and Bank of China to the US brand Victoria’s Secret, which has a big ambition in a gigantic consumer market. She’s also a regular name discussed on the social media platform Weibo, with adoring commenters calling her an “ice-snow female goddess”. But despite the outpouring of adulation in China, Gu is also walking a fine line and her future remains uncertain in the country she now represents. Last week, Hu Xijin, a recently retired editor in chief of the influential nationalist tabloid Global Times warned Chinese media to tone down their praise for Gu because it was still unclear which country she would like to associate with when she was older. “China’s national honour and credibility should not be put at stake in the case of Gu Ailing,” Hu wrote, adding that although she saw herself as both Chinese and American, “the reality may not turn out to be the way she” wished as the bilateral relations between China and the US continued to deteriorate. Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington, agreed Daly said Hu’s warning represented a growing strand of thinking in both China and the US that it was increasingly common for those with dual heritage to feel pressured into taking a side. “For many years, a large number of Chinese Americans have been free to move back and forth between both countries, benefitting both and benefitting from both without consequences,” said Daly. “But the ground has shifted under their feet.” Daly said Gu’s saga could have been a simple story when the framing of the bilateral relations was dominated by “engagement”: an American athlete who decided to move to China and won Olympic medals. But instead, the question of her citizenship has become a subject of sensitivity in the current geopolitical climate. “And Gu’s silence caused suspicion,” Daly said. “This Olympics should have put the contribution of Chinese American athletes like Gu under the spotlight – to highlight their role as a bridge to both nations, but unfortunately it has turned out to be otherwise.”",News/World news,How citizenship row clouded Eileen Gu’s Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/how-citizenship-row-clouded-eileen-gus-olympics-chinese-american-skier
2/18/2022,"A weather phenomenon known as a sting jet similar to the one seen during the Great Storm of 1987 could form on Friday as Storm Eunice takes hold, scientists have warned. The Met Office has warned that the weather phenomenon could cause “significant damage and risk to life”.  But what is a sting jet? Matt Priestley, a research scientist at the University of Exeter looking at storm tracks and extratropical cyclones, said they were small areas of very intense winds within a storm’s cyclone that were hard to predict. “They’re generally about 10 to 20 kilometres wide and are generated by specific instabilities within the flight lines of storms and cause very high wind speeds. “They’re not a feature of all storms. They’re often just a feature of the most intense ones like Storm Eunice. The fact that they are such small scale but can have such high wind speeds makes forecasting them very, very difficult.” The Great Storm of 1987, which claimed 18 lives, was the most famous example of a sting jet forming, Priestley said. “That storm had a sting jet and it uprooted millions of trees. Sting jets cause a big intensity increase compared to the rest of the cycle so they can cause a lot of extra damage very quickly like they did in 1987.” Sting jets can cause a phenomena whereby a narrow area of land is hit by very intense winds, which could reach 100mph or more, but 30 miles away there may be much slower wind speeds associated with a normal storm, of about 60-70mph. This means the damage from a sting jet can be very localised. They usually only last for about three or four hours, whereas the main storm may last a lot longer. Storm Eunice looks as if it has the features that could create a sting jet. Priestley said: “There has not been a storm this intense for 10 or 15 years.” The jets get their name from their resemblance to the sting in a scorpion’s tail, the Met Office said. They can be spotted as they develop on satellite images, where the end of the so-called cold conveyor is marked by a hook-shaped cloud with a point at the end. Dr Peter Inness, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, said a strong jet stream could “act like a production line for storms, generating a new storm every day or two”. He added: “Eunice looks like it may be able to produce a sting jet, a narrow, focused region of extremely strong winds embedded within the larger area of strong winds and lasting just a few hours.” He said two red warnings for wind in a single winter was unusual for the UK, as it was more typical to get one every two or three years.",News/UK news,Storm Eunice could create ‘sting jet’ similar to Great Storm of 1987,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/storm-eunice-could-create-sting-jet-similar-to-great-storm-of-1987
2/18/2022,"This week a peer-reviewed study confirmed what many have suspected for years: major oil companies are not fully backing up their clean energy talk with action. Now the PR and advertising firms that have been creating the industry’s greenwashing strategies for decades face a reckoning over whether they will continue serving big oil.  The study compared the rhetoric and actions on climate and clean energy from 2009 to 2020 from the world’s four largest oil companies – ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP. Writing in the journal Plos One, researchers from Tohoku University and Kyoto University in Japan conclude that the companies are not, in fact, transitioning their business models to clean energy. “The magnitude of investments and actions does not match discourse,” they write. “Until actions and investment behavior are brought into alignment with discourse, accusations of greenwashing appear well-founded.” Although this isn’t the first time that oil companies have been accused of overstating their climate bona fides, it has never been set out quite so comprehensively, according to environmental sociologist Dr Robert Brulle at Brown University. “This is the first robust, empirical, peer-reviewed analysis of the activities–of the speech, business plans, and the actual investment patterns of the major oil companies regarding their support or opposition to the transition to a sustainable society,” he says. Brulle says PR firms and advertising agencies that have created campaigns around the oil firms’ net-zero claims are now on notice. “There’s no plausible deniability that they are unaware of the activities of these companies after this paper has been published,” he says. “This paper clearly shows that these companies aren’t walking the talk.” That forces the hand of PR firms such as Edelman – which made headlines late last year for making big climate pledges while also working for oil majors like Exxon and Shell – and trade groups such as the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, which have a reputation for blocking climate policy. At a company meeting in December, the firm’s chief executive Richard Edelman told employees that the company would not walk away from fossil-fuel clients, but that it would “reject projects that delay progress toward a future with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions”. In the face of this week’s report, it would be hard to say that any oil major meets that standard. Casey Norton, a spokesperson for Exxon, said: “ExxonMobil has long acknowledged that climate change is real and poses serious risks. In addition to our substantial investments in next generation technologies, ExxonMobil also advocates for responsible climate-related policies.” “These claims of investments in clean energy are yet another case of words not matching actions,” Gregory Trencher, one of the study’s authors, says. Trencher notes that Exxon invested only 0.23% of its total capital expenditure in low-carbon energy production and development from 2010 to 2018, and that the company stated in an April 2021 energy and carbon summary report that it does not invest in renewables. As for acknowledging climate science, Trencher says that makes up “only a small part of our study–specifically, it is but one of 25 indicators studied”. Edelman did not reply to a request for comment by press time. Neither did the PR firm WPP, which has done extensive work for BP and Chevron. The New York Times’ T Brand Studio, which has created campaigns for both Exxon and Shell amplifying their net-zero claims, also declined to comment on how this study might play into that work. The Washington Post also declined to respond to questions about whether its WP Creative Group would continue to create campaigns for Chevron, Shell or the American Petroleum Institute, in light of such extensive documentation that previous campaigns were misleading. According to Brulle, it’s unlikely that PR and advertising firms will be able to serve the fossil-fuel industry as they have in the past. “It doesn’t seem to me that they have the room to do that any more,” he said. “They would have to basically engage in bad-faith advertising and greenwashing to continue to support these organizations as actually engaging in climate action.” The greenwashing study comes just a week after House Democrats Katie Porter and Raúl Grijalva sent letters to six PR firms asking for more details on their work for fossil fuel companies, particularly with respect to campaigns that misled the public on climate change. The House oversight committee has indicated that it will also question PR firms as part of its investigation into climate disinformation. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil is due back in court in Massachusetts early next month to fight charges that it defrauded residents of that state on climate. Similar fraud charges have been leveled at all of the oil majors via an ever-growing list of cases, including those filed in Minnesota, DC, Delaware, and Vermont. But Christine Arena, a former Edelman vice-president who now runs her own social impact production company Generous Films, says climate fraud can’t happen without the help of the PR and advertising industry. “PR and ad firms are central players in what we look at as the influence industry,” she says. “There’s a lot of money spent, and emphasis on external facing advertising, marketing, and promotion that helps prop up the fossil fuel industry’s social license to operate and give the world a sense that, to quote API, ‘We’re on it.’ We don’t need regulation. We’re good corporate actors.” Brulle says the media should also take note of this study, especially when an oil company chief executive makes a claim around their company’s climate commitments. “Good, critical reporting would have to challenge the statements of these fossil fuel companies,” he says.",News/Environment,The great greenwashing scam: PR firms face reckoning after spinning for big oil,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/greenwashing-pr-advertising-oil-firms-exxon-chevron-shell-bp
2/18/2022,"A California lawmaker wants to increase the allowance that people released from prison receive to cover basic needs for the first time in nearly 50 years. Sydney Kamlager, a state senator representing Los Angeles, is introducing legislation Friday to bump up the “gate money” – funds that people released from state prisons are given – from $200 to nearly $2,600.  “This is really about making sure that when people get out, we are not perpetuating a cycle of economic violence,” said Kamlager, whose office exclusively shared with the Guardian plans to introduce the new bill. “We have got to stop legislating poverty.” This is the first major effort to increase gate money in recent memory. The roughly 600,000 people released from federal and state prisons each year are usually offered a pittance – if anything – to buy a bus ticket home, or a first meal, clothing and toiletries. California currently provides a debit card loaded with at most $200, though people serving short sentences receive even less. It already offers more than other states, an investigation by the Marshall Project found. Colorado, Texas, Florida and some other states provide $100 and Louisiana and Alabama offer just $10. California last increased the amount of gate money it offers in 1973 when $200 could cover a month’s rent. “Now that money is simply insufficient to survive,” said Samual Nathaniel Brown, the co-founder of the Anti-Violence Safety and Accountability Project. When Brown was released in December after being incarcerated for 24 years, the first thing he bought was a meal for his wife, his two daughters, his sister, and his niece. It was a way to thank them for their love and support throughout his imprisonment. They got Korean barbecue, and the bill was about $140. “And there went my gate money,” he said. Brown considers himself blessed that his family picked him up from prison, and he has been able to depend on them after his release. For those without people to lean on, the $200 can be a taunt – or a sign to simply give up, he said. Reentering society after years or decades behind bars can be rough, with scarce housing and job opportunities available for people with a criminal record. Parole requirements, obligations to family, outstanding debts and health needs stack up quickly, and can be a steep hill to climb. More and broader reforms are required, said Kamlager and the activists she is working with – including of the low wages paid for exploitative prison labor. But upping gate money is also urgently necessary, she said. People often enter prison impoverished and are being thrown into poverty upon release, Kamlager said. The system “perpetuates a fall deeper into desperation for folks who have just been released”, she added. Kamlager is proposing increasing the allowance to $2,590 after consulting with federal data on the cost of food and housing, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Living Wage Calculator, to find the average monthly expenses for a single adult with no children in 2021. Starting in 2024, the bill specifies that the allowance should also be adjusted annually to account for inflation. Kamlager pushed to introduce the bill Friday, which is the last day to broach new bills during this legislative cycle. It costs California more than $8,800 to keep someone incarcerated each month, the senator noted – and increasing gate money allowance would cost the state less than pushing those just released back in to the prison system. Kamlager said she decided to introduce the legislation after receiving a letter from an incarcerated person, asking, “How do you expect any of us to make it if we’re getting out with just $200?”. “It struck a chord,” she said “In 2022, when the price for a gallon of gas in Los Angeles is almost $5, it is unconscionable that the state of California still gives just $200 in allowance for folks who are getting out of prison,” she added. Experts view a person’s first 72 hours after release as a vulnerable, crucial time that can determine whether or not they end up back in prison, said Amika Mota, the policy director for the Sister Warriors Freedom Coalition, a group that is working with Kamlager’s office on the bill. In a criminal justice system that purports to uphold public safety, providing a pittance to people when they are released is “counterproductive public safety”, Brown added. “Not having enough money, it makes people think ‘I need to do something fast’. And that’s the same type of thinking that led most women and men to prison to begin with.” For mothers leaving incarceration, $2,600 could offer a chance at finding secure housing and reuniting with their children, Mota said. Amid the pandemic, when reentry after release has been especially perilous and chaotic for many, a pilot program by the nonprofit Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) has been distributing $2,750 in cash assistance to people leaving prisons all over the US. An early evaluation found that participants were able to use the funds to buy food, pay for transportation and contribute to caring for families. Some participants said the money helped lift them out of homelessness. Meanwhile, Rasheed Stanley-Lockheart, a reentry director for the Ahimsa Collective, a restorative justice nonprofit said, “I’ve seen guys come out holding that $200 in their hand, and it’s almost like they don’t know what to do with it because they’re scared.” “We need much more than that to survive,” he said.",News/US news,"California gives people leaving prison just $200 to start over.

2/18/2022,"Are we doing enough – or even the right things – to combat antisemitism? The latest report from the Community Security Trust (CST) records the highest ever annual total of anti-Jewish hate incidents, 24% above the previous peak reached in 2019. Politicians and government officials haven’t ignored the problem – far from it. But, despite their efforts, the number of antisemitic incidents continues to rise, British Jews have become more fearful and the appearance of antisemitism itself reveals depths of ignorance and confusion. One element that makes this so difficult is the strange mix of consensus and controversy that marks public debate on the subject. The consensus lies at Westminster. Both the home secretary, Priti Patel, and her Labour shadow, Yvette Cooper, responded to the CST report with expressions of alarm and a call to action. At a moment when racism, so central to the culture wars that divide our public sphere, usually provokes disagreement, antisemitism unites the political class as little else.  Unity in the face of antisemitism is remarkable in another sense. Forty years ago, Margaret Thatcher’s government was indifferent when the Board of Deputies of British Jews proposed erecting a Holocaust memorial on the parliamentary estate. It had nothing to do with Britain, according to the foreign secretary, Lord Carrington. Today by contrast, education about the Holocaust and its memorialisation are widely seen as a remedy for antisemitism. All three main political parties are committed to building a Holocaust memorial next to parliament. The Holocaust is the only compulsory subject in the history national curriculum for pupils aged 13 to 14 and the government funds visits to Poland so schoolchildren can learn lessons from Auschwitz. Reassurance and support for the Jewish community extends further. The government provides financial support for security at synagogues and schools. In 2016, Britain was the first country to adopt the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s ( IHRA) working definition of antisemitism. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, like his predecessor, has declared his determination to work tirelessly to push universities to adopt and use the document. Antisemitism seems to be one sort of racism that the government is ready to address. Yet the consensus at Westminster reveals only one part of the picture. There is turbulence elsewhere. Although the Labour party has sought to tackle antisemitism, deep divisions remain in some constituency parties. At the same time, the focus of the campaign against antisemitism has shifted from Labour to the universities. Some universities hold out against government pressure to adopt the IHRA working definition. Jewish students and their allies welcome its adoption as vindication and protection in face of antisemitism on campus. Other students and staff, usually on the left and usually sympathetic to the Palestinians’ campaign for equality and justice, see the working definition as a threat to political and academic freedoms. In addition to these overtly political conflicts, allegations of antisemitism erupt in an astonishing variety of locations, from the stands of Tottenham Hotspur to the Royal Court theatre. So what can we do better? One frequent misconception is that the problem we face is one of antisemites. Of course, there are such people, and some carry a violent threat – but in Britain they are a minority, as the important work of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research shows. Presented with eight antisemitic statements, just 0.1% of those surveyed agreed with all eight. The problem is that antisemitism is a diffuse phenomenon. The same survey found that 30% of respondents agreed with at least one of the antisemitic statements. Antisemitism is part of the culture in which we all live and through which we make sense of the world. It is best conceived of as a reservoir of stereotypes and narratives, which accumulate over time, and from which people draw with ease, whether they intend to or not. This is why we find antisemitism expressed from positions right across the political spectrum and across society. For the most part our problem is antisemitism, not antisemites. In order to combat antisemitism effectively a wide range of groups and individuals need to recognise how they are susceptible to it. And this is one reason why the current focus on the Holocaust as a vehicle for antisemitism education should be reconsidered. Despite the effort that goes into Holocaust education, recent research by UCL’s Centre for Holocaust Education shows an alarming level of ignorance among students of what antisemitism is. We should not be surprised. There is a vast disjuncture between the Holocaust – the state-sanctioned murder of 6 million Jews – and the sort of everyday antisemitism experienced in Britain today. There are many excellent reasons to promote knowledge about the Holocaust and to foster the memory of its victims, but we must find better ways to educate about antisemitism. Jews need allies as they combat antisemitism. Here the picture is mixed. Jewish communal organisations have been successful in securing support among the political class. This is good, but it is not enough. More needs to be done, and not only by Jews, to build bridges between the struggle against anti-Jewish racism and other anti-racist campaigns. The CST collaborates with Tell Mama, which addresses anti-Muslim hatred, and together, they produced a booklet for all victims of hate crime. Several Jewish organisations have shown principled support for refugees in the face of the government’s nationality and borders bill. These are initiatives to build on. The CST report states that the landscape of UK-based antisemitism in 2021 is “largely defined by responses to conflict in Israel and Palestine”. Support for Palestinians within the left, among non-Jewish minorities and in universities, too often runs alongside indifference to antisemitism, especially when the political class is seen to be quick to respond to anti-Jewish racism. Where it exists, there is an urgent need to challenge this damaging blindspot. In this context, the preoccupation of the government and Jewish communal bodies with the IHRA working definition is counter-productive. The working definition has become tainted by its repeated abuse. Too often it is used to tarnish opinions that are deeply unwelcome to most Israel-supporting Jews, but which are not antisemitic. It leads many to argue that the IHRA working definition is more a device to protect Israel from criticism than a device to protect Jews from antisemitism. In the face of this scepticism, the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, published a year ago (and to which I contributed) can make a valuable contribution. The declaration provides clarity on when criticism of Israel and anti-Zionism lapses into antisemitism, and it aligns the struggle against antisemitism with anti-racism more broadly. It was developed by a group of leading scholars and meets a growing challenge: to provide clear guidance on how to identify and fight antisemitism while protecting free expression. Despite being anathematised by those who would like the IHRA working definition to enjoy a monopoly position, the Jerusalem Declaration can contribute to building the widest possible coalition against antisemitism. Over the past 30 years, Jewish people have become increasingly prepared to speak out against antisemitism. This welcome and historic development owes something to the wider context of anti-racist activism, which established new norms from which Jews have taken inspiration. At the same time, the earnest response from senior politicians and civil servants has fallen short. One route to further progress will be to repair the frayed connections between the struggle against antisemitism and anti-racist politics more broadly.

2/18/2022,"In the jaw-dropping saga of disgraced health-tech entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes, there was one aspect that attracted most of the public’s attention: her voice. Despite lying about her “revolutionary” pin-prick blood test technology that failed to work, then duping her patients with false diagnoses (she was convicted of four counts of defrauding investors earlier this year) it was her appearance – the Steve Jobs-esque black turtleneck jumpers and signature red lipstick – and her deep baritone, masculine-affected voice that people really zoned in on. So when The Dropout, the TV adaptation of Holmes’s life story – based on Rebecca Jarvis’s 2019 podcast of the same name – was first announced with Amanda Seyfried in the lead role, the internet was abuzz. Would Seyfried do “the voice”?  Yes, as it turns out. But while this vocal affectation might have been a joke to social media, to Melissa, who has worked in the upper management of a big tech company for the past 20 years, it’s something that rings true. “I have absolutely lived that,” Melissa – who, like all the women in tech interviewed for this article, asked for anonymity – says. “When I want to be heard at my work, I have to talk slower and deeper. If you hit too high of a pitch, they [the men] don’t hear you. If I don’t think my voice will be listened to, I’ll call a male colleague, one of my allies, prior to the meeting and say: ‘Hey, I’m going to ping you in the background, say this when I tell you to.’ They’ll be my voice.” With the news agenda for the past decade being full of the ethically dubious behaviour of some of the male leaders of the tech world, scant attention has been paid to the women in the industry, who make up just 19% of the tech workforce in the UK. The same is true reflected in pop culture. While the Tech Bro villain is now a well-worn trope in everything from the recent Matrix reboot to Succession and the video game send-up Free Guy, and we’ve had multiple portrayals of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, there’s been hardly any representation of women in tech on the small screen. With a smattering of comedy roles of women working lower down the tech chain (the brilliantly sarky Dobby from Peep Show or blagger Jen from The IT Crowd) to women actually making power moves in the industry (riot grrrl programmer Cameron in Halt and Catch Fire or whistleblower coder Nanette in the Black Mirror episode USS Callister), stories of women in tech have historically been as rare as a female CEO in Palo Alto. However, this year, TV’s gaze is finally turning to the female power-players of Silicon Valley. Alongside The Dropout, dramatisations of Sheryl Sandberg’s role as COO of Facebook (to be played by Claire Foy in Doomsday Machine) and Arianna Huffington’s position on the board at Uber (Uma Thurman, in Showtime’s Super Pumped) will hit the screen later in 2022. The onscreen depiction of these highly ambitious – some say ruthless – women will be drawn from the books that have inspired the series: Sandberg is “a master manager and delegator … who felt she was put on this planet to scale organisations” (from Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang’s An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination); while Huffington leads with “charm and persuasiveness” (as per Super Pumped’s author, Mike Isaac). But do these representations reflect what it’s really like for women working in Big Tech? Ex-Spotify employee Simone explains: “I think what links these women – and most women in the industry – is that you’ve got to be smart, strategic and driven, as it’s a very tough environment. “The big six [Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft] are where everyone wants to work and the returns are huge – you get a big salary and with all the equity … I feel like working in tech is the new banking, especially with all the shares – if you join a startup at the right time you can make millions.” Therese, who works for Facebook (now rebranded Meta), agrees: “There are unbelievable benefits to working at Facebook, the salary for starters. But really, I’m interested in being part of something that’s connected to the future, however potentially damaging that future might be. There’s something very interesting about being part of that conversation.” It has taken so long to tell the women’s stories, Simone believes, for the simple fact that it’s still an anomaly for women to be high up in big tech companies. Someone such as Holmes is a “unicorn” in a double meaning: both in the tech sense (her company Theranos became a startup with a potential valuation of $1bn); and because, as a female founder, she was as rare as the mythical beast. Her ability to talk the talk was proved by her – mainly older, male – investors, who included Rupert Murdoch, Larry Ellison and George Schultz, elevating her to a role few women have ever experienced in the industry. “I’m not exactly sure why there are so few female founders,” Simone wonders. “But in this culture it’s all about risk. Building a product is a risk, joining a startup is a risk and maybe as women we want more safety in our careers?” Slogans such as “Move fast – break things!” and “Be brave!” line the walls at Facebook but, in reality, women are rarely permitted to exhibit those types of behaviour. To be seen as impulsive or demanding perfection as a man in big tech is to be lauded – creative genius at work here! – but they’re often seen as negative qualities in a woman, who would be thought of as unreliable and branded “bossy”. In Simone’s experience, even in Spotify – a company founded in Sweden, where there is a big push for gender equality – women are still fighting to get a look in higher up the chain: “In most of the inner circles, it’s still always men who are CEO or CFO, and the token woman is head of HR or chief of operations. Women aren’t decision-making on company strategy or direction, they’re in nurturing, people-facing roles. Even Arianna [Huffington] came into Uber to clean up culture and operations.” “Oh fuck, yes, it’s still a total boys’ club,” says Melissa. “The worst are the men who think they’re enlightened but when it comes down to it they’re not. It’s not my job to teach you how to be the good guy. Go and get training! Go and figure out your own unconscious bias!” After #MeToo, there seems to have been a concerted effort by tech companies to put women in higher positions. This can sometimes come across as “female-washing” of problematic brands, says Francesca Sobande, a lecturer in digital media studies at Cardiff University. “That’s not to suggest that I think the appointment of women in certain roles in big tech is solely based on their gender identity in any way, but I do think that organisations are hyper-aware of what it means when a woman becomes a figurehead of a company that is typically associated with male-dominated spaces.” We have seen this on TV, she adds, through storylines such as Shiv Roy in Succession, brought in to chair a Waystar Royco conference to soothe shareholders’ worries about the company’s sexual misconduct issues, or when she obsequiously tries to be an ally to Gerri over those dick pics sent by her brother Roman, in what’s really a bid to take him down instead. “[In] a show like Succession there is a risk sometimes that these sorts of conversations overlook the agency of women,” says Sobande. “A character like Shiv knows exactly what she’s doing when she’s making certain decisions that relate to the optics of gender and power. “It’s important when thinking about these things to always acknowledge the agency of women within this, and what it means for a woman to sometimes knowingly participate in or be complicit in these types of power dynamics that oppress other women.” This oppression of other women is seen offscreen, too, Therese says: “I’ve definitely experienced women trying to emulate the men of Silicon Valley. I’ve seen some terrible things, and it can really crush you.” Therese remembers one senior woman who was manipulative and “should not have been in power”. “If I’m being kind about it, it was probably her reaction to the highly competitive system. The pressure of being constantly reviewed in the six-monthly 360 reviews – where overtime is encouraged and your bonus is based on it – it starts to affect how you feel about yourself, as a person, and it affects everything. It starts to influence your feelings about your self-identity and self-worth. It’s a massively, massively entrenched system.” What is telling in previous TV representations of women in tech, says Sobande, is what is overlooked, from the fact that these stories are all solely focused on white women to them not including “a critique of the power dynamics and the often oppressive capitalist structure that they’re implicated in”. For those few “unicorns’’ who make it through to the top in Silicon Valley, it might feel like a hollow victory, given the accusations that many of these companies are entrenched in ethically questionable behaviour – manipulating users’ emotions; allowing conspiracy theories to spread – in the name of profit. Sobande adds: “In some pop culture portrayals we see confusion for a representation of any woman in a position of power with it symbolising some form of feminism. With these upcoming series, I’m intrigued to what extent we’re going to see this ‘girlboss’ narrative coming through, and whether or not there’s going to be [an implication of] a feminist sentiment to any of what is depicted.” Simone also wonders if we can ever square the dichotomy of working for certain corporations that appear to be morally bankrupt yet claim to empower women: “I’m so interested to see Doomsday Machine because of the juxtaposition of Facebook’s morals and Sheryl [Sandberg]’s heavy messaging about women ‘leaning in’ [the concept at the centre of Sandberg’s bestselling 2013 nonfiction book]. I want to get into her psyche about how you balance those two things: promoting women but in a company that does so much destruction. But it’s not just her. I think sometimes women are the ones who are expected to be the ethical ones in the industry. “I’m fascinated by it.” As are those of us outside big tech, too. Some names have been changed.

2/18/2022,"Great news for Star Trek fans, though perhaps not hardcore “Trekkers”. The long-running sci-fi saga is returning to the big screen with a fourth episode featuring Chris Pine’s Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto’s Spock, along with the duo’s various Starship Enterprise crewmates. Simon Pegg’s Scotty, Zoe Saldana’s Uhura, Karl Urban’s Bones and John Cho’s Sulu are all tipped to return for a movie to be directed by WandaVision’s Matt Shakman, provided deals can be done with agents. According to Variety, Paramount hopes the project could be shooting by the end of this year. The only question is why the studio didn’t get this one zooming past the moon a lot earlier. Justin Lin’s Star Trek Beyond (the third film in the rebooted series) may have struggled at the box office in 2016, certainly for such an expensive, high-profile effort. And let’s not forget how much some fans hated 2013’s Star Trek Into Darkness. But generally, the series and its cast have been well-received by critics and audiences.  So why plan another film now, especially as Star Trek hardly needs the big screen to thrive in the era of streaming? Small screen spin-offs such as Picard and Star Trek: Discovery have found their audiences, while Paramount was so nervous about making a fourth instalment that it reportedly carried out market research into whether fans really wanted to see Pine and Quinto back on the bridge (luckily, they did). Three years ago, an attempt to bring back the series floundered three years ago when the studio was unable to strike a deal with Chris Hemsworth to reprise his brief cameo as Kirk’s dad from 2009’s Star Trek, which suggests the men in suits didn’t believe a new episode could work without parachuting in a star name best known for an entirely different franchise (in Hemsworth’s case, the Marvel Cinematic Universe). But perhaps Paramount has finally worked out how fortunate it is to have a film series that could easily be at the beginning of its run rather than the end. The genius of JJ Abrams’ 2009 Star Trek (much to the chagrin of certain fans, who didn’t want time travel involved) was that it completely rebooted the timeline, giving the series permission to go in any direction it saw fit. If Kirk and co wanted their next adventure to be a psychedelic journey to the home-planet of the Tribbles in the company of those dodgy aliens from the (y racially insensitive) Next Generation episode Code of Honor, they could do so without any worries about damaging the legacy of previous shows and movies. By comparison with Star Wars, the possibilities are endless. Abrams himself managed to foul up the most recent Star Wars film, largely because he couldn’t work out how to make it interesting without cannibalising all the good stuff from George Lucas’s original trilogy – despite that tale having already been told. From a storytelling point of view, Star Trek finds itself in a much better place, with its main participants conceivably right at the beginning of their adventures. To end up in anything like such a positive position, Star Wars would have to completely recast Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia, and find them something to do other than defeat Darth Vader and blow up various Death Stars. This will almost certainly happen one day, but it would go down about as well as a Disney+ spin-off about Jar Jar Binks if producers were to try it right now. Trekkers, of course, detest that Abrams rebooted Star Trek to make it more like Star Wars. Gone are the plotlines dealing with philosophical questions about the nature of mankind and its place in the universe. In their place are madcap space battles and helter-skelter sprints through alien jungles. It turns out that granting film-makers the freedom to boldly go where no screenwriter had gone before made for some of the greatest space-opera set pieces in modern cinema. Meanwhile, the Star Wars franchise (despite the brilliant Mandalorian) continues to underestimate fans’ appetite for fresh stories set a long time ago in that galaxy far, far away. The Book of Boba Fett is just the latest example of producers dredging up characters that should have been left to get digested by the sarlacc. We can only hope that Patty Jenkins’ forthcoming Rogue Squadron will learn from the show’s many mistakes. So let’s welcome back Star Trek, and hope those fee negotiations go well.

2/18/2022,"Environmentalists in Montana called it the “death watch”. Following years of financial losses one of the handful of remaining coal-fired power plants in the state appeared doomed, its likely fate offering a small but noteworthy victory in the effort to avoid disastrous climate change. But then a bitcoin mining company stepped in to resurrect it. The Hardin generating station, a 115-megawatt coal plant located a dozen miles from the historic site of the famous battle of Little Big Horn in southern Montana, was slated for closure in 2018 due to a lack of customers only to somehow limp on, operating on just 46 days in 2020. “We were just waiting for this thing to die,” said Anne Hedges, co-director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “They were struggling and looking to close. It was on the brink. And then this cryptocurrency company came along.”  In a deal struck in late 2020, Marathon, a bitcoin “mining” company, became the sole recipient of the power station’s electricity. It established an elongated data center on 20 acres of land beside the facility that is packed with more than 30,000 Antminer S19 units, a specialized computer that mines for bitcoin. Such thirst for power is common in crypto – globally bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than Norway, a country of 5.3 million people. As the bitcoin miners moved in last year, Hardin roared back to life. In the first nine months of 2021 alone, the plant’s boilers fired up on 236 separate days. Planet-heating emissions from the burning of Hardin’s coal soared too, with 187,000 tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the second quarter of last year, more than 5000% more than was expelled in the same period in 2020. In the third quarter, a further 206,000 tons of CO2 was emitted, a 905% increase on 2020, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows. Hardin was operating at “near full capacity”, Marathon said in a December update, with the data center producing around 34 bitcoin on 1 December. “I was horrified to see it all happen, it was a terrible turn of events,” said Hedges, who took to visiting the plant and photographing the new data center as it took shape, fans perched on its roof to help cool the humming computer hardware. “This isn’t helping old ladies from freezing to death, it’s to enrich a few people while destroying our climate for all of us. If you’re concerned about climate change you should have nothing to do with cryptocurrency, it’s a disaster for the climate.” Hardin is part of a wave of America’s “zombie” fossil fuel plants that have been brought back from the dead by cryptocurrency companies looking to feed the insatiable energy demands of their mining operations. China, formerly the epicenter of the bitcoin industry, effectively banished around half of the world’s currency miners last year and the resulting search for cheap power has seen companies eye struggling US power stations. In 2020, a mothballed coal plant in upstate New York was converted to run on gas and power a large-scale bitcoin mining operation, a move that owner Greenidge Generation said is “bringing a piece of the world’s digital future” to the state. Eric Adams, the new New York City mayor who said he would accept his first paycheck in bitcoin, last week criticised the environmental impact of crypto mining. Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, thousands of bitcoin mining computers have been packed in shipping containers alongside the Scrubgrass plant, which burns waste coal and was set to close before pivoting to bitcoin. And in Kentucky, a new bitcoin facility is being built next to the Big Rivers Electric Corporation, which owns and operates four coal-fired power plants. This tactic, crypto firms argue, generates local jobs – Kentucky aimed to lure currency miners by passing a law that exempts them from an electricity sales tax – and uses up excess power without straining the grid for homes and businesses. But critics point out that the enormous electricity consumption needed to sustain the virtual currency is fueling the climate crisis and now threatens a partial resurrection of coal in the US. “Coal and natural gas power plants used for crypto mining that would otherwise be sunsetting as we decarbonize adds yet more carbon to the atmosphere in an era when we should be cutting such emissions,” said Benjamin Jones, a specialist in natural resource economics at the University of New Mexico. “Crypto’s continued or expanding use of fossil fuel sourced electricity imposes significant environmental economic costs on society.” Jones said it is “troubling” to see that bitcoin’s already huge energy consumption is increasing and that most of this is coming from fossil fuels, despite some efforts by mining companies to increase the amount of clean energy they use – Marathon, the company that draws power from Hardin, has struck a separate agreement in Texas to take power from a wind farm. Even some early champions of bitcoin have balked at its energy use, with Elon Musk last year halting Tesla’s use of the crypto currency because, he said, the electric vehicle company is “concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel”. Uber, the ride-hailing service, has said it won’t accept crypto payments until the climate impacts are reduced. A little more than a decade ago, it was possible to mine bitcoins with a single computer at home, using a negligible amount of electricity. The ultimate supply of bitcoins was limited and new bitcoins were awarded to those who could help validate transactions – the miners. The process of validation essentially involves playing a giant guessing game that gets more difficult the more miners participate. As interest in bitcoin has soared, fast, powerful computers, packed in warehouses, now have a better chance of winning the guessing game and being rewarded with several bitcoins, which are currently worth around $42,000 each. This race for bitcoin wealth gobbles up an enormous amount of electricity – around 0.5% of total global consumption. The energy used to mine bitcoin every 60 seconds would be enough to power the average American household for 17 years, while the annual electricity consumption for mining would be able to power all kettles used to boil water for tea in the UK for 28 years. While this usage has been criticized by climate activists, bitcoin miners claim it should be put in a different context. Fred Thiel, chief executive of Marathon, said that the movement of physical goods around the world, and even the use of washing machines in the US, uses more energy than bitcoin. “I understand the desire for some people to point bitcoin mining as the big bad boy, but on a comparison with every other industry out there, it’s insignificant,” he said in an interview. Thiel likens bitcoin mining to the transactions processed in data centers by companies such as Amazon and Google and claimed that the industry is moving quickly towards renewable energy – Marathon plans to phase out its use of coal next year – after finding its options were limited when miners had to quickly shift away from China. “Go back to 2020, renewable companies weren’t offering energy to bitcoin miners,” said Thiel. “Very few people wanted to even deal with bitcoin miners in the energy world. And so bitcoin miners spent time looking for stranded assets. And so the only way for us to mine was to find stranded energy, which we did in finding the Hardin plant.” It remains to be seen if bitcoin will make a significant move away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime it will likely come under increasing scrutiny over its appetite for fossil fuel-powered electricity. “We simply don’t know how emissions from bitcoin mining will look in five to 10 years,” said Jones, the University of New Mexico professor. “It seems likely, though, it will to continue to be a major consumer of energy going forward.”",News/Technology,Bitcoin miners revived a dying fossil fuel plant – then CO2 emissions soared,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/18/bitcoin-miners-revive-fossil-fuel-plant-co2-emissions-soared

2/18/2022,"The books of James Joyce, along with Middlemarch and War and Peace, were among the titles that many vowed to read when the UK was plunged into its first coronavirus lockdown. Almost two years later, we now know that most of us filled all that time indoors with Netflix and Zoom quizzes rather than catching up on lengthy classics (apart from the author David Mitchell, who did read Ulysses in 2020). But with this month marking the centenary of Ulysses and 140 years since Joyce’s birth, perhaps now really is the time to familiarise or re-familiarise yourself with the influential modernist writer.  Dubliners, a collection of frank, direct short stories that find moments of epiphany amid ordinary Irish life, was published in 1914 after nearly a decade of setbacks and censorship. The Dead, the story of a Christmas feast, is its finale and crowning glory. Complete with singsongs, political arguments and annoying drunken guests, its bittersweet apprehension of the fragility of celebration amid the passing of time has never been surpassed. “Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road …” In the opening pages of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, a consciousness flexes and expands before our eyes. The language develops along with the young Stephen Dedalus as he begins to process his surroundings, from the mysteries of adult relationships to the brutal hierarchies of school. Joyce’s groundbreaking first novel goes on to follow his fictional alter ego as he grapples with the constrictions of Catholicism, family and social convention, and sets in motion his overwhelming need to escape his homeland and create something new. “Apart from everything that you could possibly imagine, nothing much happens in Ulysses,” wrote Anne Enright in her recent celebration of its centenary. A young man and an older one wander Dublin, their paths repeatedly crossing, and a woman lies in bed thinking, on 16 June 1904. Each section pushes at least one new style of telling to the limits, as the narration flits from mind to mind. It is still revolutionary today, as well as being knotty, funny, humane and endlessly rewarding. “I prefer the poetry” would be a madly contrarian position, but the slim volumes Chamber Music and Pomes Penyeach will give you snatches of Joyce in seconds. They provide a fascinating angle on his literary development and showcase his musicality, moving from traditional romantic swoons to a fragile, sincere beauty. Pomes Penyeach was my own gateway to Joyce, after my dad, never usually a spontaneous present giver, left a copy in my room when I was 12. The delicate fragments sparked my interest in the oversized paperback of Ulysses that loomed over the Len Deightons and Le Carrés on his bookshelf. Now we always have something to talk about. Stephen Hero, an earlier, more traditionally realistic treatment of the material that became Portrait of the Artist, was rescued by Joyce’s sister after he threw it on the fire. As an unfinished novel, it has an unimprovable last line – “He remained behind gazing into the canal near the feet of the body, looking at a fragment of paper on which was …” – but today it’s one for the scholars. Joyce teased that his “big long wide high deep dense prosework” Finnegans Wake, 17 years in the writing, would “keep the critics busy for 300 years”. If you read the final words, “A way a lone a last a loved a long the”, then turn back to page one – “rivverrun, past Eve and Adam’s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay …” – you are swept around again. It’s a Freudian family psychodrama crossed with the fall of man, taking in the history of Ireland, myths, legends, jokes, shame, desire, sin, cycles of time, death, chaos and resurrection. Ulysses tracked a single day; Finnegans Wake, a single night. Governed by dream logic, it’s written in a dream language built out of multilingual puns, compounds and nonsense words: more than 600 dense pages of the stuff. Joyce said you should simply read aloud if you get stuck, but if that doesn’t work you could try A Shorter Finnegans Wake, abridged by Joyce superfan Anthony Burgess. Burgess’s friendly interjections, illuminating what’s going on, give the reader the confidence to wander alone and to stir in personal preoccupations and associations. For more than any other book, perhaps, Finnegans Wake is created afresh each time – as Joyce put it: “I give readers the opportunity to supplement what they read with their own imagination.” It’s always a Work in Progress, to use the original title; we all dream the Wake.",Arts/Books,Where to start with: James Joyce,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/18/where-to-start-with-james-joyce
2/18/2022,"Good morning. Donald Trump and his two eldest children have been ordered by a New York judge to sit for a civil deposition in the deepening investigation over alleged fraud in the valuation of assets belonging to his family business.  Judge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump, Donald Jr and Ivanka to comply with subpoenas issued by the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, intensifying the former president’s legal woes in a week in which his accounting firm cut ties with him after a decade. Trump must testify within 21 days and submit “documents and information” within a fortnight. Responding to the ruling, he accused James’s office of “doing everything within their corrupt discretion to interfere with [his] business relationships and with the political process” and labeled the ruling a “witch-hunt”. The case is running parallel to a criminal investigation, conducted by James with the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, into Trump accounts. Testifying could risk Trump potentially implicating himself. Could Trump plead the fifth? It would be tricky: his criminal defense lawyer says it would be front-page news and would make it impossible to pick a jury. Additionally, Trump has previously mocked the practice, saying: “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the fifth amendment?” What’s next? Trump is likely to appeal against the decision ordering him to comply with the subpoena. Republicans who legislated against the disruption caused by racial justice protests following George Floyd’s murder have come out in favour of similar tactics used by conservative trucker convoys opposing public health rules. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, last year signed an anti-rioting law that included giving a degree of legal protection to drivers who ran over protesters. A federal judge struck down the law in September, ruling it unconstitutional. But now, DeSantis has thrown his weight behind the Canadian truckers, whose protests against a vaccine mandate are causing disruptions to the global supply chain. Meanwhile, the Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who was opposed to the tactics used by racial justice protesters, has said he is “all for” the disruption caused by the convoy. “I hope the truckers do come to America. I hope they clog up cities,” he said. Who else has backed the convoy? Ted Cruz has demanded an investigation into GoFundMe after it deleted the page for donations to Canadian truckers, as did DeSantis. The Ohio congressman Jim Jordan also criticized the platform. How should the double standard be understood? This rhetoric is Republicans seizing any opportunity to attack Joe Biden – rather than being part of a “hard ideological stance”, said Jared Holt, an extremism researcher. The University of California, Berkeley may be forced to cut its new admissions by about a third after a local neighborhood group pushed back against the environmental impact of its expansion plan. Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods successfully argued the college was in breach of a major environmental law by failing to account for increases in the trash, traffic and noise that would accompany the plan. The university is asking California’s supreme court to intervene. In the university’s environmental impact study for the new construction, it argued rising enrolment had had “no significant environmental impacts” in previous years, but a county judge disagreed in August. Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods also argued that a lack of housing had meant students had pushed into the city, affecting housing. What has the challenge achieved? The university will send out 5,100 fewer admission letters than planned next month, missing out on $57m in tuition fees over the 2022-23 academic year. What do critics say? They argue the California Environmental Quality Act is being used as a pretext to block necessary housing and infrastructure. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling and other ceasefire violations as tensions continued to grow. The accusations, coming from Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed rebels in the country’s east, involved both sides claiming there were incidents of mortar fire on Friday.

2/18/2022,"A UN nuclear taskforce has promised to prioritise safety as it launches a review of controversial plans by Japan to release more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water into the ocean from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Japan’s government announced last April that it had decided to release the water over several decades into the Pacific Ocean, despite strong opposition from local fishers and neighbouring China and South Korea.  Lydie Evrard, the deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], speaking after a team of experts visited the plant to collect water samples, said on Friday: “We listen very carefully to local people’s concerns and the inspection is designed to provide answers about safety in a transparent manner.” . The controversy comes almost 11 years after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. Tsunami waves crashed into Fukushima Daiichi, knocking out its backup electricity supply, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors and sending large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere. More than 150,000 people were forced to flee their homes, and evacuation orders in communities closest to the plant have only recently been partially lifted. The Tokyo Electric Power company (Tepco) says its treatment technology can remove all radioactive materials from water except tritium, which is harmless in small amounts. It said the gradual release of the water, diluted with seawater, would not pose a threat to human health or the marine environment. In 2020, however, Greenpeace said the water still contained contaminants beside tritium and would have to be treated again. The wastewater is being stored in about 1,000 tanks that officials say need to be removed so the plant can be decommissioned, an operation expected to take several decades. The tanks are expected to reach their capacity of 1.37m tonnes this summer. The liquid includes water used to cool the damaged reactors, as well as rain and groundwater that seeps into the area. Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist for Greenpeace East Asia, said he did not believe the IAEA would fully investigate and address safety and environmental concerns in its report. Noting that the agency had welcomed the discharge option when it was announced last year, Burnie said: “The IAEA is not an independent agency in nuclear affairs – under statute its mission is to promote nuclear power. It has sought to justify radioactive marine pollution as having no impact and safe. But the IAEA is incapable of protecting the environment, human health or human rights from radiation risks – that’s not its job. “The IAEA taskforce should be investigating the root cause of the contaminated water crisis and exploring the option of long-term storage and the best available processing technology as an alternative to the deliberate contamination of the Pacific.” The IAEA team, which includes experts from South Korea and China, will report its findings at the end of April. South Korea, which has yet to lift an import ban on Fukushima seafood introduced in 2013, has said that discharging the water would pose a “grave threat” to the marine environment. Pacific peoples have challenged Japan to prove the water is safe by dumping it in Tokyo. Local fishers also oppose the water’s release, saying it would undo a decade’s work to rebuild their industry and reassure nervous consumers their seafood is safe. Junichi Matsumoto, a Tepco official overseeing management of the treated water, said the utility was prioritising safety and the effect on the Fukushima region’s reputation. “Ensuring transparency and objectivity is crucial to the project,” he said this week. “We hope to further improve the objectivity and transparency of the process based on the review.”",News/Environment,UN to review Japan’s plan to release Fukushima water into Pacific,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/un-to-review-japans-plan-to-release-fukushima-water-into-pacific
2/18/2022,"One of Samuel Beckett’s most celebrated plays, Endgame can seem unapproachably austere in its depiction of a living hell. In Danya Taymor’s vibrant new production, the abstraction of four characters trapped in a room after some unspecified catastrophe has new resonance: there is a suggestion of environmental destruction – or perhaps the aftermath of a pandemic.  And uncared-for elderly couple, Nell (Gina Moxley) and Nagg (Seán McGinley) are confined to grey dustbins, in even greyer uniforms, living on scraps of biscuits. Their son, the blind Hamm (Frankie Boyle) and his endlessly put-upon carer-servant, Clov (Robert Sheehan) enact a series of daily routines and rituals that are repeated to the point of exhaustion. As Clov struggles up a ladder to the high windows of Sabine Dargent’s wide-angled set, he describes what he sees in the world outside: nothing, zero, the same as before, same as every day. The ocean’s tides have stopped and there is “no more nature”. Within the room, “something is taking its course” – something which, if Hamm tries hard enough to remember a distant past, might even mean something. Sitting paralysed in his armchair, wrapped in blankets, Hamm is played by Boyle with arch weariness and absurd flashes of actorly hauteur. His portrayal of Hamm is more sympathetic than usual; occasionally he seems almost fond of the boyish Clov. Sheehan’s deft timing and easy physical comedy keep the tone buoyant. Frustrated rather than angry, Clov comments on his own performance with relish: “This is what is called making an exit.” All four actors emphasise the dialogue’s mordantly comic tone, paying minute attention to timbre of voice and flickers of facial expression, Moxley in particular. Her question to Nagg, “Have you anything else to say to me?” is both touchingly hopeful and knowingly hopeless. Even the most often-quoted exchanges seem fresh, as when Clov hangs over Nagg’s dustbin to see if he’s still alive. “He’s crying,” he reports. “Then he’s living,” comes Hamm’s rapid-fire response. Together this beautifully directed ensemble make Beckett’s influential portrayal of nihilism moving and unexpectedly invigorating.

2/18/2022,"An emergency Cobra meeting will be held as England and Wales are braced for what is expected to be one of the worst storms in decades, with millions told to stay at home to avoid winds of up to 90mph and the army placed on standby. Ministers and officials will meet on Friday afternoon, after Storm Eunice prompted rare red weather warnings – meaning danger to life – across much of England and Wales.  A government spokesperson said: “The minister for the Cabinet Office will chair a COBR this afternoon to discuss the response to Storm Eunice.” The highest alert – meaning a major impact is very likely – was widened shortly before 4am to cover the east of England including London, to run from 10am until 3pm on Friday, due to fears of the storm “causing significant disruption and dangerous conditions due to extremely strong winds”, the Met Office said. The warning covering Greater London, Kent, Surrey, Essex and east Sussex joined an earlier red weather warning starting from 7am along the coastline of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, as well as the south coast of Wales, due to the combination of high tides, strong winds and storm surge. There is a risk of “flying debris resulting in danger to life” and “damage to buildings and homes, with roofs blown off and power lines brought down” along the coastline of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset as well as the south coast of Wales. The Met Office chief meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: “After the impacts from Storm Dudley for many on Wednesday, Storm Eunice will bring damaging gusts in what could be one of the most impactful storms to affect southern and central parts of the UK for a few years.” On media morning rounds on Friday, Hinds said people should take precautions, adding that the army was on “high readiness standby” to help. He told Sky News: “We are strongly encouraging people to take precautions and make sure they stay safe.” He added: “Over the longer term a lot of learning has been done from Storm Arwen, particularly on dealing with welfare issues, staying in touch with people, staying in touch with customers for the [power] networks. “But in the immediate term there are troops on high readiness standby, the Environment Agency on the ground, the networks themselves have to be very much active, and they are. “Weather is unpredictable and it is really important that we all continue … to take those precautions and try to keep everyone safe.” Asked if people could get “cut off” by the storm, Hinds said that was “absolutely a risk”, and the red weather warning indicated a “risk to life and limb”. People have been warned to tie down objects in their gardens and be wary of fierce winds, which could cause trees to topple over and tiles to fly off buildings. “Make sure you follow the advice of local authorities and councils, fasten doors and windows tonight and tomorrow morning and keep your cars locked in garages or away from trees and walls,” said the Met Office forecaster Annie Shuttleworth. “People will see significant delays to travel and power cuts, so you should avoid travelling if you can and stay at home when winds reach the highest speeds.” A Network Rail spokesperson said disruption was “inevitable” and Welsh services would be suspended for the whole day. The railway operator said there would be blanket speed restrictions of 50mph in most places. London North East Railway urged customers with tickets for Friday to travel on Saturday instead or get a refund due to expected disruption and damage. Some airports including Gatwick and Stansted advised customers to check the status of their flights with airlines, as well as allowing plenty of time to travel. Transport for Greater Manchester has asked customers to “please consider whether your journey is essential today and take care if you are out and about”. The operator said Storm Eunice was likely to cause significant disruption from 5am until 9pm. The Met Office also took the unusual step of issuing a severe weather alert with National Highways for strong winds covering the whole of the country’s strategic road network from 6am to 6pm. National Highways said high-sided vehicles and other “vulnerable” vehicles such as caravans and motorbikes could be blown over so should avoid bridges and viaducts. Those travelling between England and Wales faced difficulties with the closing of the M48 Severn Bridge. The service said the A14 Orwell Bridge in Suffolk would be closed in both directions from 4am with the QEII Bridge in Dartford closed from 5am. Serious flooding may take place along the coastlines of the south and west of England as spring tides are expected on Friday morning. It comes after Storm Dudley caused travel disruption and power cuts to parts of the UK on Wednesday. The government’s Cobra emergency committee met on Thursday to discuss the storm response and plan for power cuts. Amber warnings – the second highest alert level – for wind were in place across the whole of England from 5am to 9pm on Friday, while yellow weather warnings – the next level down – for wind and snow were in force for a large part of Scotland where blizzards were predicted and the whole of Northern Ireland. Some councils across the UK are to help shelter homeless people and halt bin collections. In Scotland, a weather warning for snow was in place between 3am and 6pm on Friday, while a wind warning encompasses the south-west Scottish borders, including most of Dumfries and Galloway. Snow was forecast for most of mainland Scotland on Friday, south of Inverness and Fort William.",News/UK news,Storm Eunice: Cobra meeting called as UK braces for ‘worst storm in decades’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/storm-eunice-london-added-to-red-weather-warning-amid-danger-to-life
2/18/2022,"Acommon criticism of pop music today is that it is too dominated by technology. Vocals are smoothed into perfect pitch and drums or synths come from presets, the end result being that too many songs sound almost the same. They are lacking humanity, those critics say – literally brainless. For Raw Data Feel, their superb new album, Everything Everything have gone further still, “abandoning the human brain”, says singer Jonathan Higgs, in favour of artificial intelligence. “Not until we were about halfway through,” he elaborates over a cuppa in a Manchester bar. “But, yeah, that’s exactly what we did.”  The singer was fascinated to read about how AI was being used to create poetry. “That’s one step away from what I do,” he thought. Curious, he used social media to ask people working in machine learning to get in touch. The most intriguing reply came from Mark Hanslip, a musician and researcher at the University of York’s Contemporary Music Research Centre. Higgs asked: “If I send you the data, can you feed it into your machine?” Because Higgs’ lyrics tend to mix what he describes as “cold technology, modern toxicity, ancient myths and an element of prophecy”, he gave Hanslip an array of such raw data, drawn from extremes of human existence. “I wanted something really corporate, so I gave him LinkedIn’s terms and conditions,” he says. “Then I wanted something completely opposite, which was Beowulf, one of the oldest English poems.” The “dangerous, toxic, modern stuff” came courtesy of 400,000 comments from the internet forum 4chan, downloaded as a block. “Then I threw Confucius in as well, for a philosophical veneer.” The process took an age, during which time Higgs sent Hanslip various prompts to give the gizmo. “And after all this it spat out reams and reams of nonsense,” Higgs chuckles. Songwriters (or any of us) can rest easy: human creativity isn’t about to be totally replaced by machines. In the end, Higgs estimates that AI provided only about 5% of the finished lyrics, but it did contribute a song title, (Software Greatman), plus imagery for artwork and videos, and did enough to get a songwriting credit. “Confusingly, we named it after one of the protagonists in the songs,” grins bassist/keyboardist Jeremy Pritchard. “So it’s called Kevin.” This engaging mix of intellectual curiosity and playfulness has made the Manchester-based foursome one of the UK’s premier art-rock bands, with five Top 40 albums (three of them Top 5) and a fanbase big enough to fill the 10,000-capacity Alexandra Palace. In person, they are not cold androids with their heads stuck in VR, though. Our hour-long conversation is peppered with laughter and self-mockery. Pritchard says that he and drummer Mike Spearman are “particularly luddite” and admits: “I haven’t turned my laptop on for a year, and it’s from 2012.” Higgs reveals that tour bus activities tend to revolve around hanging out watching films of clothed chimpanzees rather than exploring new technology. He thinks the metaverse – a parallel space for online living, much trumpeted by Mark Zuckerberg – is “not particularly good” and as for cryptocurrency or NFTs, they are “mainly awful”. Granted, they do pepper conversation with phrases such as “cultural theory” or “maximalism”. Otherwise it’s hard to reconcile the two amiable chaps (Spearman and guitar/keyboardist Alex Robertshaw are elsewhere) with their regular depiction in the press as “geeks” or “nerd-rockers”. “Would you call David Bowie a geek?” Higgs asks, reasonably. “Or Brian Eno?” “Eno gets called a boffin,” sniggers Pritchard, prompting Higgs to further consider. “The bands that get given that label are Devo, Buggles and Kraftwerk,” he grins. “All of whom we love! And we do wear boiler suits and listen to Kraftwerk. So, er, yes.” Pritchard prefers to think of Everything Everything in terms of something Graham Coxon once said about Blur. “He said there’s ‘high street Blur’ – Parklife – and ‘backstreet Blur’, the druggy, scuzzy side, and the two sides are far apart. I see our band like that. On the face of it we’re a gurning party band in brightly coloured clothes, and then there’s this more considered underbelly.” When Everything Everything formed in 2006, shortly after Higgs and Pritchard met on a popular-music-and-recording course at Salford University, naming the band after a Radiohead lyric, they were – briefly – like any other group. They played guitars because they were into the Futureheads and it was the quickest way of getting gigs in pubs. Initially, they performed in jeans and T-shirts. “But we never really clicked as one of those bands visually,” Higgs says. So, as synths came in, they developed a “utilitarian aesthetic like Kraftwerk or Devo. When we’re in the dressing room putting the garb on, we can feel the transformation.” Even then they thought outside the box. I remind them of an early manifesto by initial member Alex Niven (who left to become, of course, an academic): “To take contemporary R&B and pop music and fashion a vaguely Futurist project out of it, a détournement of sorts of an oversaturated media culture into something idealistic and expansive.” Higgs chuckles at the language – “That’s exactly why we got called geeks or nerds!” – but admits: “That’s sort of how it was. We were excited by areas of music that we weren’t really allowed to go [into]. Like, we loved Destiny’s Child, but we’re not Black American women, so there’s no way we could sound like that. But we tried and instead something else came out.” If anything, 2010’s Mercury-nominated debut, Man Alive, contained too many ideas for its own good. “It gave us about 12 possible directions, none of which we really took,” Pritchard says. “But we were trying to avoid cliches and over the course of the albums we refined the sound and focus.” They hit form in 2015 with Get to Heaven and the Mercury-nominated A Fever Dream in 2017, a terrific dystopian double whammy that respectively anticipate and ponder a world of populism, Trump and Brexit. “We’ve consistently been ahead of the times without meaning to be, really,” Higgs says, describing how Reddit message boards gave him a sense of a forthcoming political sea change, which fed into Get to Heaven. “I think we’re living through an era of revolution because of what the internet has done to us. After Brexit I knew Trump was coming but I was singing more about that type of thing, the fear that fuels it and the rise of the charlatan in general. I actually had in mind a more competent [Nigel] Farage.” Higgs calls 2020’s pre-pandemic Re-Animator “an album about recovery, made before the bad thing happened” but says he’s now done with “documenting what the Tories are up to or that kind of bollocks. I knew it would be crap when they got in but I don’t want to listen to someone telling me that now.” Instead, Raw Data Feel is, ironically, their most human and personal album, full of beautiful songs reminiscent of Talk Talk, A-ha or Peter Gabriel and rich in empathy and emotion. Some of this reflects changes in band members’ lives – new relationships or parenthood. Others are as dystopian as ever, but less explicitly. Higgs says that AI and the character of Kevin was in part “this idea of a runaway kid that was dreaming of a magical power that could take him out of his life, which is how I was feeling” and also a “proxy to talk about some areas I wasn’t that happy talking about”. The first single, Bad Friday, about a victim of violence on a night out, is based on an amalgamation of real incidents. “I do know exactly what happened, but I don’t want to deal with it,” Higgs says. “It’s a recurring theme, sort of retracting that part of my memory.” Similarly, the sublime, New Order-like Jennifer seems to reference domestic violence and a suicide attempt. Higgs calls it “the most honest song I’ve ever written” and he explains that the gorgeous chorus (“the pain in the end is all in your memory”) is his way of “kinda trying to reassure someone else”. Another standout, Metroland is Burning, is a rebellious fantasy about wanting to burn down the indoor theme park once housed in the Metrocentre in Gateshead – “Not the place there now, the one in my head from when I was a teenager” – but Leviathan is a tender goodbye from a mother to a child, and there are references to love and hope. If there’s an overarching theme, it’s that however bad things are, we can get through. “I thought: why am I spending my energy and emotion on this external man [Trump], 5,000 miles away, when I can think about what’s good about life?” Higgs says. “And try to make my life not so shit when everything is falling apart. I think a lot of people will feel the same. It feels like a fresh start.”  Raw Data Feel is released on 20 May on Banquet Records.

2/18/2022,"In the eyes of Antonio Conte, ketchup and mayonnaise are strictly forbidden. Pep Guardiola is supposedly not keen on his squad eating pizza and David Moyes has voiced concerns about chips finding their way into a player’s diet. At Rotherham United, the League One leaders, there is one simple rule at the training ground: mobile phones are banned. “Some lads will definitely have their phones in their toiletry bags but apart from doing a military strip search there is not much I can do on that,” says their affable manager, Paul Warne. “Sometimes I do like to casually walk through their dressing room and just catch someone. I think if they’re not on their phones all the time, they might actually speak to each other, which is quite a nice thing.” Conversation flows with Warne, whether he is discussing dressing up for the Super Bowl, being a big James Bond fan – “although the Timothy Dalton phase was a bit cheesy” – his mother tuning into every Rotherham game on iFollow, comparing the nauseating feeling of wanting his players to succeed to watching your child play the lead role in the school pantomime, or taking his labrador, Chief, for a walk to decompress after a game.  “It is a bit of sanity for me, talking to a four-legged friend. I saw something on YouTube the other day saying that when dogs go out for their walk, it is like their social media. They’ll scratch their feet on a bit and that’s like an Instagram shot, they’ll wee on a bit and that’s like a Twitter post, they’ll send something else and that’s like a Facebook thing, and they’ll leave messages for other dogs. So whenever I go out now, because my dog loves to scent on virtually everything he sees, I’m thinking: ‘What a good, sociable dog he is.’ The whole village’s dogs must wait for his next message.” Warne, a qualified teacher and previously the team’s fitness coach, is modest and searingly honest, so much so at times it is hard to remember he is a successful manager – Rotherham are 15 games from what would be his third promotion to the Championship in five years – but there are more serious subjects to broach, too. He tries not to beat himself up as much these days but acknowledges it is easy to say that when things are going well. His team have the Football League’s best defensive record – five goals conceded away from home – and are League One’s top scorers. Keeping the team in the second tier has eluded him, though. “It feels like something around my neck to a certain extent,” he says. “We want to try and work our way up to feeling like we belong in the Championship, which is a big ask, but it isn’t unattainable.” Warne believes management has wiped years off his life and last month had his annual medical “MOT” courtesy of the League Managers Association. “You get your heart scanned, your lungs, you do a fitness test on a treadmill while you’re all ECG’d up, you get your hearing tested, which is probably about my only great attribute … you get your prostate checked, you get everything,” the 48-year-old says, before recalling a game at AFC Wimbledon in August 2019. “I stood up to shout at a player 10 minutes into the game and I just went all wobbly. I thought: ‘Oh my God, I’m going to collapse.’ I had just lost my dad and I was heavily dehydrated. I hadn’t eaten all day. I went for a run in the morning and I remember crying – I probably had some emotive music on as well. I was completely drained. It highlighted the fact that you can go from sitting still to your heart rate being 200 beats per minute in the split of a decision. Some managers don’t eat on a match day. It’s really difficult to eat on a match day but since then I’ve forced myself to drink more and eat something. Stress is definitely a killer and there cannot be many jobs more stressful than a football manager.” Last season was particularly painful, with Rotherham relegated on the final day after conceding an 88th-minute equaliser at Cardiff scored by Marlon Pack, who apologised to Warne for his mis-hit shot that nestled in the opposite corner. Warne fought back tears during an emotional post-match interview. Does he sometimes pine for quieter life? “I think all managers would to a certain extent. They probably won’t admit it because it’s the worse thing to say if you ever want to be employed by a different club, but there are times when I’m on the side of the pitch thinking: ‘What am I doing this for? I’m in absolute purgatory standing here, freezing my chuff off,’ the other manager is abusing you for something, and sometimes you just think: ‘Wow, this is some way to earn a living.’” If anything sums up Warne, it is the heartfelt video call he shared with his players and staff upon promotion in 2020, when he broke down at the end of a series of thank-you messages. He won’t be waxing lyrical on Friday, regardless of the result against second-placed Wigan. “After a game I always shake the hand of every single player and staff member, whether we win 5-0 or lose 5-0; I’ll never change that,” he says. “I thanked them when we got relegated at Cardiff. But you can’t thank them mid-season because as soon as you thank them, they think they have got it sussed.”",Sport/Football,"Rotherham’s Paul Warne: ‘At times I think, what am I doing this for?’",https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2022/feb/18/rotherhams-paul-warne-at-times-i-think-what-am-i-doing-this-for
