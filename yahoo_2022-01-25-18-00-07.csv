1/25/2022,"More than 44 years after a 27-year-old woman mysteriously vanished in California, authorities have positively identified her “partial skeletal remains.” The remains, including a skull, were discovered in 1986—nine years after she vanished—by a survey crew along an embankment of the Ortega Highway in Lake Elsinore, but at the time authorities were unable to positively identify the victim, who had been shot in the head, according to a statement from the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office. It wasn’t until the Riverside County Regional Cold Case Homicide Team exhumed several unidentified skeletal remains for DNA analysis earlier this year that investigators were finally able to provide some answers about what happened to 27-year-old Linda LeBeau, whose maiden name had been Durnall. Investigators were able to positively identify the remains last week after a familial DNA match was discovered in the Department of Justice’s Missing Unidentified Persons database. Linda disappeared in 1977 around the time she had been planning to meet her ex-husband, Phillip LeBeau, at a Love’s Restaurant to collect $300 from him after he had allegedly damaged her new boyfriend’s car, slashing his tires and pouring sugar into the gas tank, The Orange County Register reported in 2013. That day, a witness reported seeing the 27-year-old inside her Volkswagen van arguing with an unidentified man at a nearby Texaco after the meeting. Linda was never seen again and her van was discovered abandoned at the entrance to the southbound I-5 three days later. All of her belongings had been left inside the vehicle. Suspicion soon turned to Phillip—who died in 2008—particularly after investigators learned that he had returned home late the night Linda disappeared, soaking wet and wearing different clothing than he had on when he had left the house. “The ex-husband would clearly be a suspect in this case,” Tustin Police Department Lt. Tom Tarpley told the newspaper at the time. Linda had been Phillip’s third wife and those who knew the couple described a volatile and allegedly violent relationship.  After the couple divorced, Phillip allegedly continued to harass his ex-wife by breaking into her apartment, stealing some of her belongings and damaging her new boyfriend’s car, according to The Charley Project.  Although the district attorney’s office did not mention Phillip in the latest update on the case, they did say that Tustin Police investigators had maintained an “active investigation” for years but were unable to “bring the case to resolution.”  In light of Phillip’s death more than a decade ago, it’s unclear whether any charges will ever be filed in Linda’s case; however, her younger brother Doug Durnall told The Orange County Register in 2013 that finding his sister would provide the family with some closure. “I’d like to see something resolved,” he said. “I’ve already put this behind me, but it would be nice to have one glimmer of hope to at least put her in a gravesite.” ",U.S./Oxygen,California Authorities Positively Identify Remains Of Missing Woman Who Vanished In 1977,https://news.yahoo.com/california-authorities-positively-identify-remains-123300963.html
1/25/2022,"A Los Angeles police sergeant rescued an unconscious toddler after her parents flagged down a patrol car in the Echo Park neighborhood on January 19. Body camera footage released by the LAPD shows a man in distress handing the young girl to the sergeant, saying “Please, I don’t know what’s wrong.” The footage shows the sergeant radioing to say she is “not conscious, not breathing,” before slapping her back several times to clear the airway. The young girl is then heard crying, and the sergeant says “something came out.” The girl was brought to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles where she was in stable condition, police said.

1/25/2022,"The James Webb Space Telescope has reached its new home. NASA has confirmed the remote observatory successfully entered its final orbit around the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point (aka L2) after one last course correction burn. The telescope's primary mirror segments and secondary mirror have already been deployed, but you'll have to wait until the summer for the first imagery. NASA will spend the next several months readying the JWST for service, including a three-month optics alignment process. The L2 orbit is crucial to the telescope's mission. It provides a largely unobstructed view of space while giving the spacecraft a cold, interference-free position that helps its instruments live up to their full potential. The JWST is expected to study the early Universe using infrared light, providing data that wouldn't be available from an Earth orbit telescope like Hubble. The arrival is also a relief for NASA. The stakes were high given the project's $10 billion cost, of course, but it also proves that the space agency could successfully launch and deploy a sophisticated observatory far from Earth. And while they're different devices, the JWST is widely considered the spiritual successor to Hubble — with the older telescope clearly in rough shape, expectations are particularly high for the new machine. 🏠 Home, home on Lagrange! We successfully completed our burn to start #NASAWebb on its orbit of the 2nd Lagrange point (L2), about a million miles (1.5 million km) from Earth. It will orbit the Sun, in line with Earth, as it orbits L2. https://t.co/bsIU3vccAj #UnfoldTheUniverse pic.twitter.com/WDhuANEP5h — NASA Webb Telescope (@NASAWebb) January 24, 2022",Science/Engadget,The James Webb Space Telescope arrives at its final orbit,https://news.yahoo.com/james-webb-space-telescope-arrives-at-final-orbit-203522307.html
