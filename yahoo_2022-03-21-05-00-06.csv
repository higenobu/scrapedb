3/21/2022,"Mikhail Baryshnikov is standing up for Russian artists and athletes who are taking the heat for President Vladimir Putin's devastating attacks on Ukraine. The iconic Soviet-born dancer, 74, who famously defected to Canada in 1974, spoke out to the Guardian, clarifying that while “an open exchange in the arts is always a good thing,” that doesn't mean public figures should be punished for their government's actions. “I don’t think it’s right to put the weight of a country’s political decisions on the backs of artists, or athletes, who may have vulnerable family members in their home country,"" Baryshnikov said. ""For people in those exposed positions, neutrality is a powerful statement."" The former Sex and the City star went on to argue that Russian tennis player Daniil Medvedev should not be banned from playing at Wimbledon if he does not denounce Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Following a meeting at British Parliament on Tuesday, sports minister Nigel Huddleston confirmed that discussions were taking place to prevent supporters of Putin from entering the tennis tournament, Yahoo Sports previously reported. Medvedev and his fellow athletes would have to ""denounce"" Putin's efforts if they wanted to compete. Baryshnikov, who was born in what is now modern-day Lativa, continued, saying that “right now there’s a Rubicon for Russia to cross. Either it will find a way to end this current conflict and live in an open global society, or it will be thrust backwards with no hope of recovery."" Baryshnikov went on to say that the choice to criticize or applaud one's country should be the right of the individual. He also compared the current status of Russia to that of the time of Joseph Stalin. “It’s the individual decision of every artist whether they choose to speak out or not. ... In simple terms, Russia is already back in Stalin’s time,"" he said. ""The arts are collateral damage and it’s impossible to speculate how that will play out.” Earlier this month, Baryshnikov urged Russians to aid Ukrainian refugees who are suffering as a result of the attacks on their country. As a member of the True Russia initiative, which has a fundraising company to aid Ukrainian refugees, Baryshnikov, along with writer Boris Akunin and economist Sergei Guriev, posted a statement on the organization's website criticizing Putin, saying ""the dictator who currently holds power in the Russian Federation has launched a criminal war."" ""The horror unleashed on our kindred people in Ukraine is becoming a true humanitarian catastrophe. The hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have lost their homes, their livelihoods, their loved ones and even their lives are bearing the full brunt of the blow,” the statement reads. “But all of us who speak Russian and belong to the Russian cultural world feel the blow, too. The very word 'Russian' has become toxic. Most of us are far away from the conflict and from Russia. We may be powerless to stop this nightmare, but we do not have to remain idle.” The statement continued, stating that ""the number of refugees will keep rising. The humanitarian situation will worsen. The very least we can do is help the people fleeing from the horror that Putin has started in Russia’s name. The real Russia is bigger, stronger, and more durable than Putin. This Russia lives and will outlive him. The dictator is fighting a war not only with Ukraine, but against the better part of his own country. He is smothering Russia’s future. Let us prove to the rest of the world that Putin does not speak and act for all Russians. And let us prove to ourselves that we are capable of real concrete action, not just words. Let us help our Ukrainian friends. Please donate to help Ukrainian refugees. Russians of the world, unite against war!""",World/Yahoo Celebrity,"Mikhail Baryshnikov says it's not 'right to put the weight of a country’s political decisions on the backs of' Russian artists, athletes",https://news.yahoo.com/mikhail-baryshnikov-doesnt-want-russian-athletes-or-artists-punished-war-185257803.html
3/21/2022,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki attempted to dismiss a reporter's question Friday when he asked about the ""conflicts of interest"" the Biden administration faces ""when it comes to sanctioning people (from Russia and China) who have done business with"" the Biden family. Steven Nelson, a reporter for the New York Post, highlighted a 2020 report from the Senate Homeland Security and Finance committees that alleged an investment firm co-founded by Hunter Biden — Rosemont Seneca Thornton — ""received $3.5 million in a wire transfer"" from Russian billionaire Elena Baturina. He also noted a report that claimed then-Vice President Biden had dinner with the same woman in Georgetown. NEWS ORGS THAT DISMISSED HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY ‘ABSOLUTELY NEED TO CORRECT THE RECORD,’ WATCHDOGS SAY ""This Elena Baturina, she has not been sanctioned yet by the U.S. government. How is President Biden navigating conflicts of interest when it comes to sanctioning people who have done business with this family and can you explain to us what this $3.5 million was for,"" Nelson asked. ""I don't have any confirmation of the accuracy of that report, so I have no more further details,"" Psaki responded, moving to call on other reporters in the room. Pressed once more about the conflicts of interest in sanctioning those in Russia who reportedly have had business dealings with the Biden family, Psaki said, ""What would be his conflicts of interest?"" ""His son's company allegedly got $3.5 million from …"" Nelson said before Psaki interrupted. ""Which I have no confirmation of, and he's continued to sanction oligarchs more than we've sanctioned in the past, so I'm not sure that's a conflict of interest,"" Psaki responded. Late last year, Hunter Biden, according to his attorney, divested from his assets with Chinese private equity firm Bohai Harvest RST Equity Investment Fund Management Co. through Skaneateles LLC. Attempting to call on other reporters, Psaki was pressed by Nelson about that divestment and potential conflicts of interest surrounding President Biden's decision-making in regard to China. ""We have received not even basic transparency about who bought out his stake, when this happened and how much money changed hands,"" Nelson said. ""Did he actually divest, and if so, can you agree to basic transparency?"" ""He's a private citizen, he doesn't work for the government,"" Psaki said. ""I'd point you to his representatives."" A report Wednesday by The New York Times confirmed the authenticity of Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, which was left in a Delaware repair shop in 2019 by the first son before being turned over to the FBI by the repair shop owner. The new Times report, which was flagged by The New York Post and focused on the investigation into Hunter Biden's taxes and his international business dealings, noted prosecutors had examined emails between Biden and some business associates that ""appear to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop"" and ""were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation."" Psaki previously said reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop in 2020 was part of a ""Russian disinformation"" campaign. Fox News' Houston Keene, Andrew Mark Miller, and Joseph A.

3/21/2022,"Will it be round two for Rishi vs Boris? Boris Johnson: ‘Blindingly obvious’ now’s not the time for IndyRef2 David Cameron joins the Ukraine war effort by driving lorry to Poland Camilla Tominey: Nicola Sturgeon has turned Scotland into a banana republic Jacob Rees-Mogg: Ukraine war shows ‘partygate’ was ‘fluff’ Vladimir Putin is in a ""total panic"" about the prospect of a revolution in Moscow, Boris Johnson has said. ""He has been in a total panic about a so-called colour revolution in Moscow itself and that is why he is trying so brutally to snuff out the flame of freedom in Ukraine and that's why it is so vital that he fails,"" Mr Johnson said. ""A victorious Putin will not stop in Ukraine, and the end of freedom in Ukraine will mean the extinction of any hope of freedom in Georgia and then Moldova, it will mean the beginning of a new age of intimidation across eastern Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea."" The Prime Minister also rejected normalising relations with Mr Putin, even after the end of his invasion of Ukraine. ""This is a turning point for the world. It's a choice between freedom and oppression,"" he told the Conservative spring party conference in Blackpool. ""To try to renormalise relations with Putin after this, as we did in 2014, would be to make exactly the same mistake again."" The Prime Minister has described Putin as a ""a backstreet pusher, feeding addiction, creating dependence"" on Russia's gas and oil, leading to the cost of living crisis. ""Putin's war is intended to cause economic damage to the west and to benefit him,"" Boris Johnson told the conference. ""He knows that with every dollar increase in the price of a barrel of oil, he gets billions more in revenues from the sales of either oil and gas, and that's the tragedy of the situation. ""Now he wants to weaken the collective will to resist by pushing up the cost of living, hitting us at the pumps and in our fuel bills, so we must respond."" He said the Government must continue to do ""everything they can"" to help people, and also make sure there is a ""strong economy and strong economic fundamentals with well-paid jobs"". Concluding his speech, the Prime Minister said: ""It’s the Conservatives who stand up for freedom and against the blackmail of Putin."" ""Because we know that it’s only by sticking up for freedom that we can deliver long term prosperity and security."" Douglas Ross has argued that Nicola Sturgeon's SNP has no ""positive ideas"" to help Scotland on any of the big issues facing its people, reports Simon Johnson. He says his party's aim must be to replace them in government at the next Holyrood election rather than being the main opposition party. He says: ""People concerned right now about the cost-of-living crisis, concerned right now about long waiting times in our NHS, concerned about the education we are giving to the next generation. ""And they all know that independence is not the answer to any of those problems. ""Not once did I hear anyone say that they wanted an independence referendum next year. Not once. ""They want a government that’s totally focused on the NHS, on jobs, on education, on their priorities. ""There are so many people who are looking for anyone who can step up and beat them, who can remove this SNP Government, who can kick Nicola Sturgeon out of Bute House. ""Because coming second place, being the largest opposition, is not enough. Boris Johnson has urged nations to end their dependency on Russian oil and gas as it allows Vladimir Putin to squeeze the Western cost of living. ""There is a cost to our sanctions. But the cost of doing nothing would be far, far higher,"" the PM said. ""Now Putin wants to weaken to weaken the collective will to resist by pushing up the cost of living. Hitting us at the pumps and in our fuel bills."" ""It is time to take back control of our energy supplies."" Boris Johnson has rejected normalising relations with Vladimir Putin, even after the end of his invasion of Ukraine. ""This is a turning point for the world. It's a choice between freedom and oppression,"" he said. ""To try to renormalise relations with Putin after this, as we did in 2014, would be to make exactly the same mistake again."" ""I know it is the instinct of the people of this country to choose freedom every time."" Boris Johnson said Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine because he fears free societies. ""We stand with the Ukrainian people and our hearts go out to them,"" the Prime Minister told the Ukrainian ambassador. ""It is clear Putin made a catastrophic mistake."" ""He didn't really believe the semi-mystical guff he wrote about the origins of the Russian people. I don't know if you read it. Nostradamus meets Russian Wikipedia,"" he quipped. ""He was frightened of Ukraine because in Ukraine they have free press. They have free elections. And with every year Ukraine progressed towards freedom and democracy and open markets, he feared the Ukrainian example and the implicit reproach to himself."" ""Because in Putin's Russia you get jailed for 15 years just for calling an invasion an invasion, and if you stand against Putin in an election you get poisoned or shot."" Mr Putin was in a ""total panic"" about the prospect of a revolution in Moscow, Mr Johnson added. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Putin's invasion of Ukraine has ""shattered our post-Cold War complacency"", reports our chief political correspondent Camilla Turner. She said we ""cannot and will not"" rest until we see Ukraine's sovereignty restored, and told delegates that she has heard some people in Ukraine ""sing God Save The Queen"" as they use British military equipment. Ms Truss said: ""When we’re facing a tyrant like Vladimir Putin, the only thing he understands is strength."" She went on to tell delegates: ""Now is the time to end the culture of self-doubt, the constant self-questioning and introspection - the ludicrous debates about languages, statues and pronouns. Our history, warts and all, is what makes us what we are today."" Liz Truss used her speech to reiterate the Conservative commitment to freedom. ""This crisis has shown the strength of the free world,"" she said. ""When people are free to choose, they choose freedom."" ""We live in a great country, a great democracy and we should be proud of it."" Concluding our speech, Ms Truss said: ""Putin must fail and with Britain at the front, we will ensure he does."" Addressing Vadym Prystaiko, Liz Truss said: ""Ambassador, everyone in Britain is saying Slava Ukraini."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has vowed to continue standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine until their sovereignty is restored. ""We stand up for freedom. We fight bullies. We galvanise our allies around the world,"" she said. ""We cannot stand by to see freedom repressed and see the clock turned back to the horrific oppression of the Soviet era. We cannot and we will not rest until Ukraine's sovereignty is restored."" Concluding his speech in Blackpool, Ben Wallace welcomed Ukraine's ambassador Vadym Prystaiko to a raucous standing ovation from all those in attendance. Alister Jack describes how he managed to win over the ""initially sceptical"" SNP to back the UK Government's Freeports scheme, with two to be delivered in Scotland, reports Simon Johnson. ""Something you would have thought all parties in Scotland would welcome. Sadly there is still one that doesn’t: the Scottish Greens,"" he says, renewing his attack on Nicola Sturgeon entering a coalition with them. ""It just shows how irresponsible it was for the SNP to invite into government a party that is fundamentally opposed to economic growth. ""Even some people in the SNP are beginning to realise what a disastrous mistake that was."" Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack is giving his speech to the Scottish Tory conference in Aberdeen, reports Simon Johnson. He said: ""The people of Scotland rightly expect their two governments to work together because they understand it is the best way to unlock the potential of devolution. Now, it is not always easy to work with this SNP-Green Scottish Government. ""Of course it can be difficult trying to deliver the benefits of devolution alongside a Nationalist administration in Edinburgh that does not believe in devolution. An administration whose politics demand constant friction with the UK Government and a freshly brewed grievance every morning. They may not be able to manufacture a ferry, ladies and gentlemen, but they sure know how to manufacture a grievance."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace compared Vladimir Putin to the leader of Argentina during the Falklands War 40 years ago. He said that like Leopoldo Galtieri, Mr Putin had sent young soldiers to die for his own political reasons. ""Just like in 1982, Putin's arrogant assumptions have directly led to the casualties and attrition among the Russian army,"" Mr Wallace told the Tory spring conference in Blackpool. ""The Kremlin assumed that Ukraine would not fight - he was wrong. The Kremlin assumed his army was invincible - they were wrong. ""And they assumed the international community would splinter and they've been proven wrong."" Mr Wallace said that during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, mothers of those killed in action called the dead their ""boys in zinc"" because of the metal coffins they used. ""None of us should let today's Russian president forget to despite dozens of presidents and prime ministers urging him not to invade, the international community's calls for peace, he chose zinc."" Priti Patel has defended the Home Office's checks on Ukrainian refugees saying it is ""naive"" to believe that only men can pose a threat to the UK's security as she warns of heightened threat of chemical, biological and cyber attacks from Russia. ""I've been asked why couldn't we suspend security checks on people escaping Putin's war?"" she said. ""Times of conflict, my friends, emphasises our need to remain watchful. I know from the briefings I receive from the intelligence and security services that instability around the world brings with it greater threats."" ""Only four years ago, the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil - it happened in Salisbury, whose inhabitants would have felt completely safe."" She added: ""The truth is that a very small number of people can wreak utter havoc and Russia has a history of covert, hostile activity."" ""And I'm afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives or that refugee flows would not be subject to some form of exploitation."" ""There are those who would come to our country, to this country, who would mean us harm and plot to strike at our very way of life."" Priti Patel has announced that illegal entry to the UK will impact on asylum claims made by migrants ""Access to the UK's asylum system should be based on need and not the ability to pay people smugglers. If you enter the UK illegally, via a safe country where you could have claimed asylum, you're not seeking refuge from peril, but picking the UK as a preferred destination,"" she said. ""For the first time, whether you enter the UK legally or illegally will impact on how your asylum claim progresses and on your status in the UK if your claim is successful."" Ms Patel also announced that the maximum sentence for people smuggling will increase from 15 years to life. The Home Secretary has said the UK will tighten controls on the UK financial system, including in the areas of money-laundering and cryptocurrency. ""No criminal or kleptocrat will be able to hide behind a UK shell company ever again,"" she vowed. Priti Patel reiterated in her speech that the UK is open to Ukrainian refugees. ""The British government and the people of the United Kingdom are utterly determined that Putin will fail in his war and that we will open our homes and our hearts to Ukrainians,"" she said. ""We will always stand for freedom and the values that are fundamental to our way of life."" ""As Ukrainians know as hell rains upon them, the United Kingdom stands with them in their hour of need."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has hailed the ""incredible"" repsonse by Poland to the refugee crisis. ""A few weeks ago I was on the Polish border with Ukraine. What I saw was a human tragedy on a heart-breaking and unprecedented scale,"" she said. ""What I also saw was the incredible response of our dear friends in Poland. From the government to volunteers who have mobilised an incredible response to welcome and manage refugees."" ""I saw the most remarkable humanitarian work from the government and people of Poland. I have to tell you, it broke my heart."" George Eustice concluded his speech by highlighting the need to keep supply chains open in order to ensure the world can remain fed despite Ukraine's wheat harvest being impacted by the invasion. ""In Ukraine today, the determination to get this year's crop in the ground shows that Ukraine is a country that believes in its future and that refuses to give up,"" he said. ""There is over 200 million tonnes of wheat in storage around the world at the moment. Those who operate the market need to be able to move stocks around freely in order to satisfy global demand."" ""The UK is largely self-sufficient in wheat production,"" he added ""But we are working with like-minded countries around the world to ensure the free flow continues."" The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has kicked off day two of the Conservative spring conference by paying tribute to the ""tenacity"" of Ukrainians and in particular the country's farmers. ""In recent weeks, we've all been moved by the incredible courage of Ukraine's president, the extraordinary bravery of the Ukrainian army and the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people,"" he said. ""We have also seen the morale-boosting sight of Ukrainian farmers towing away Russian tanks with their tractors, just one of the many symbols of Ukraine's extraordinary tenacity."" Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said there was ""revulsion"" about P&O Ferries' actions in sacking 800 staff. He told Times Radio the Government was trying to establish whether the move was legal. ""That is why the Transport Secretary (Grant Shapps) has asked the Insolvency Service to look at the notification requirements, for example, and see whether further action is appropriate,"" Mr Dowden said. ""All of us feel, frankly, a revulsion at the kind of sharp practices from P&O. There has been a complete lack of engagement, a lack of prior notice or indeed any empathy whatsoever for the workers."" The Government has already said it is reviewing all contracts it has with P&O Ferries and its owner DP World. ""I think they should be in no doubt that the Government is considering very closely its relationship with them,"" Mr Dowden said.",World/The Telegraph,"Vladimir Putin in 'total panic' about revolution in Moscow, says Boris Johnson",https://news.yahoo.com/politics-latest-news-boris-johnson-085651405.html
