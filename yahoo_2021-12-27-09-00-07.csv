12/27/2021,"A woman was taken into FBI custody two days before Christmas after she caused a disturbance on a Tampa to Atlanta flight that resulted in injuries, according to the Atlanta Police Department. Delta flight 2790 departed from Tampa International Airport at 5:39 p.m. Thursday. During the flight, Patricia Cornwall became unruly and injured passengers and Delta employees, police said. When the plane landed at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport, statements from flight passengers and visible evidence led police to detain Cornwall. Police contacted the on-call FBI agent and officers moved Cornwall to the Atlanta Police Department precinct. FBI agents then took custody of Cornwall. No other information was released. The extent of the injuries suffered by passengers and Delta flight employees was not released. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in November directed U.S. attorneys to prioritize the prosecution of federal crimes on commercial flights. “The Department of Justice is committed to using its resources to do its part to prevent violence, intimidation, threats of violence and other criminal behavior that endangers the safety of passengers, flight crews and flight attendants on commercial aircraft,” Garland said in a news release.","U.S./Tampa Bay Times, St. Petersburg, Fla.","Delta flight from Tampa to Atlanta ends in injuries after ‘unruly passenger,’ police say",https://news.yahoo.com/delta-flight-tampa-atlanta-ends-192600540.html
12/27/2021,"Sheriff David Hutchinson, Hennepin County's top cop, said he understands why some community groups have called for his resignation after his drunk driving accident and arrest Dec. 8. He is quick to admit what he did was inexcusable, but said he has no plans to give up the last two years of his term. ""Getting sober has helped me regain my drive to serve the people of Hennepin County to the best of my ability,"" he said. ""I have a lot more to give."" He's proud of the work his agency has accomplished under his leadership, including immigration and jail reforms, working high profiles cases and taking lots of guns off the street. Violent crime is plaguing the county and the nation, and he wants to continue his efforts to reduce it. ""I want to be on the forefront of public safety,"" Hutchinson said. ""Driving drunk has been the lowest point in my life. I embarrassed myself, my agency and my family. But I want to be a role model to people in law enforcement and first responders."" He said he planned to do the right thing before making the decision to drink and drive after a state sheriffs' convention in Alexandria. He had some drinks at one of the hospitality suites in the evening and eventually went back to his room, where he intended to spend the night. But he said he couldn't sleep, packed his bag and decided to make the long trip back to the Twin Cities. Hutchinson admits the details are fuzzy on what led to the accident that nearly took his life. His county-owned sport utility vehicle veered off Interstate 94 at 2:30 a.m. and onto a snow-covered shoulder. The vehicle went into a ditch and flipped, leaving him with several broken ribs and vertebrae and a concussion. The sheriff had a blood alcohol content was 0.13%; the state legal limit is 0.08%. He was charged with four misdemeanor drunk driving charges, but pleaded guilty to 4th-degree driving under the influence of alcohol. ""All the other sheriffs made the right decision to not drink and drive that night,"" he said in his first interview Sunday since the accident. ""What I did was inexcusable. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm am confident in my ability to serve in the next year and beyond."" Hutchinson, 41, spent time recovering at a hospital in Alexandria and at his parents' home before returning to work. His husband, who is a firefighter, helps lift him out of bed as he continues to recuperate. He has received many visitors and calls of support from friends and people in the addiction recovery community. He is attending outpatient treatment for his struggles with alcohol, saying the crash was a huge wake up call. ""Everything is always 20/20,"" Hutchinson said. ""I've been a social drinker for awhile and have probably been drinking a little more than I should lately. I know I needed help. Alcohol is not for me."" As part of his plea agreement, he was placed on probation for two years. He isn't allowed to drink alcohol during that time and will have to submit to random testing. Hutchinson said he doesn't believe he has ever intended to drink and drive in the past, but he can't be sure it hasn't happened. Alcohol has never impacted his work as sheriff, he said. ""I don't want to make anymore dumb decisions that involve alcohol,"" he said. ""I don't want to hurt anybody."" He admitted sometimes drinking alcohol to ""turn of my with struggles and stress,"" but treatment has taught him other ways to cope such as going to the gym, read a book or take a walk. ""There is a lot of stress in law enforcement that impacts every street officer, every sheriff and every police chief,"" he said. ""We have to find smart ways to deal with it. Drinking isn't one of them."" He said he knows some police officers who like to drink too much at times, but Hutchinson implored them to get a ride if they do. ""I will pay for your Uber,"" he said. Hutchinson was elected to a four-year term in 2019, narrowly defeating longtime incumbent Rich Stanek. He said he loves being in law enforcement and wants to leave a positive legacy. ""This will be a black eye for me,"" he said. ""We have been going through some of the craziest times in our national history. I'm not proud of getting a DUI, but I'm proud of the work of the sheriff's office.""",U.S./Star Tribune (Minneapolis),Sheriff Hutchinson says he has no plans to step down after drunken-driving offense,https://news.yahoo.com/sheriff-hutchinson-says-no-plans-205400731.html

12/27/2021,"Vice President Kamala Harris said the White House was seeking a way to ""creatively"" address student debt. The Biden administration in December announced student loan payments would be halted until May 1. Harris said ""we have to continue to do what we're doing and figure out how we can creatively relieve the pressure that students are feeling."" Vice President Kamala Harris in an interview that aired Sunday said the Biden administration was working to find a way to ""creatively"" address student debt, citing the pressures it causes for Americans. ""I think that we have to continue to do what we're doing and figure out how we can creatively relieve the pressure that students are feeling because of their student loan debt,"" Harris told CBS News' Margaret Brennan during an interview on ""Face the Nation."" Harris said that Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona was ""working on what we can do and must do frankly to relieve the pressures of student loan debt."" ""Graduates and former students across our country are literally making decisions about whether they can have a family, whether they can buy a home,"" she said, adding that she previously had student loan debt. ""And it's no small matter, and we need to figure out a way to relieve debt. So it's a fair issue in terms of the seriousness of the issue,""she said. The administration of President Joe Biden in December extended the federal pause on student loan payments, allowing borrowers to avoid paying until May 1 as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus causes COVID-19 cases in the US to rise. ""Voting we've discussed, it is a very big issue, and what I believe we must do is continue to be vigilant and fighting for folks who have a right to be seen and their circumstances to be heard and understood because we have the ability to actually alleviate the burdens that people are carrying that make it difficult for them to get through the day or in the month,"" Harris added. ""This additional extension of the repayment pause will provide critical relief to borrowers who continue to face financial hardships as a result of the pandemic, and will allow our Administration to assess the impacts of Omicron on student borrowers,"" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a December 22 statement. ""As we prepare for the return to repayment in May, we will continue to provide tools and supports to borrowers so they can enter into the repayment plan that is responsive to their financial situation, such as an income-driven repayment plan,"" he added. Some Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have called on the Biden administration to go futher than delaying debt payments, asking the president to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt. During his 2020 campaign for president, Biden pledged to forgive ""a minimum"" of $10,000 of student loan debt per person. ""Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again,"" he said in a March 22, 2020 tweet. So far, he hasn't followed through on that promise.
