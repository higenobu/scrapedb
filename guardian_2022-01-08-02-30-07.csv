1/8/2022,"The problem with coverage of this week’s anniversary of the events of 6 January 2021 is that too much of it was written in the past tense. True, the attempted insurrection that saw a violent mob storm Capitol Hill in order to overturn a democratic election was a year ago, but the danger it poses is clear and present – and looms over the future. For the grim truth is that while Donald Trump is the last US president, he may also be the next. What’s more, the menace of Trumpism is darker now than it ever was before. This grim prognosis rests on two premises: the current weakness of Joe Biden and the current strength of his predecessor. Start with the latter, evidence of which comes from the contrast in how Trump’s fellow Republican politicians talked about 6 January at the time and how they talk – or don’t talk – about it now.  At the time, they were clear that the outgoing president had crossed a line, that he was “practically and morally responsible” for the rioters who had marched on Congress and built gallows for those politicians who stood in their way. Many of those Republicans had pleaded with Trump, sending text messages begging him to call off the mob. Now, though, they either say nothing – refusing even to show up for a moment’s silence in memory of those killed on 6 January – or they rush to apologise for having, rightly, branded that day a “violent terrorist attack”. That’s because they fear Trump and they fear his supporters. In order not to rouse their fury, they have to mouth the new shibboleths: they have to accept the big lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and accept that political violence is not to be condemned but indulged when it comes from your own side. It means that Trump’s tactics, his authoritarianism, have not shamed or repelled Republicans – as some hoped might be the result of 6 January – but infected them. What was once the eccentric stance of the lunatic fringe – that Trump won an election that more than 60 different court judgments ruled he had lost – has become the required credo of one of America’s two governing parties, believed by two-thirds of Republican voters. More alarming still, surveys show 30% of Republicans say that “true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.” Word the question slightly differently, and that figure rises to 40%. Not for nothing did the editor of the New Yorker this week ask if a second American civil war is coming. You might imagine that all this should secure Biden’s position. Surely the majority of the US electorate will rally to the message he set out so trenchantly in a speech on Thursday taking direct aim at Trump and the “web of lies” he had spread to soothe his own “bruised ego”. Surely they will recoil from a Republican party that is breaking from the fundamentals of democracy. Surely they’ll turn away from the party of Trump and flock to the Democrats as the only reliable democrats. But that is not how it’s playing out. Biden has the lowest approval rating of any US president at this stage of his term, barring Trump himself. He is trailing especially badly with the independent voters who decide elections. Polls suggest that Democrats will lose seats in November’s midterm contests, thereby losing control of the House of Representatives and perhaps the Senate too. That will leave Biden paralysed, unable to pass any legislation at all without Republican approval. Which is why 2022 is the make-or-break year for the Biden presidency. If it breaks, the ground will be laid for the return of Trump in 2024. Except this will be a Trump with fewer restraints than held him back before, one who now openly espouses the autocrat’s creed that elections are illegitimate unless he wins them, that he alone should hold office and that violence is justified to maintain his power. Republicans are working hard to unlevel the playing field in Trump’s favour. Republican-run states are rewriting electoral law to make it harder to vote – curbing the early or postal balloting often used by low-income and minority voters – and handing Republican-controlled state legislatures extra powers over the running of elections. They want to remove one of the safety mechanisms that ensured the integrity of the 2020 contest: fair-minded election officials. To that end, they are setting about filling those all-important positions with Trump loyalists. Put simply, they want fewer people voting and their people counting. Current Republican strength is a combination, then, of both the resilience of public support, despite the party’s submission to Trumpism, and its ability to game the system in its favour. But it is also a function of Biden’s weakness. It’s worth recalling here how shaky the president’s position was from the start, seeking to govern with a diminished, razor-thin Democratic majority in the House and a 50-50 deadlocked Senate. Despite that, he has passed some major bills and made some big, even transformative moves. As the former speechwriter to George W Bush David Frum puts it: “In 11 months, Biden has done more with 50 Democratic senators than Barack Obama did with 57.” And yet, it’s not enough. Biden passed a vital infrastructure bill, but his larger package of social spending and action on the climate crisis is stalled. His poll ratings took a hit with the speed of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan after August’s chaotic US withdrawal. And his 4 July declaration that America could celebrate its “independence from Covid-19” now looks horribly premature. You can make a strong case that none of these things is Biden’s fault. His spending bill is stalled thanks to two Democratic senators who simply refuse to get on board. (Given their politics, Biden probably deserves credit for getting them to back him as often as they have.) The withdrawal from Afghanistan was under a deal agreed by Trump; indeed, Trump’s exit would have come earlier. As for Covid, what could any president do when more than a quarter of the country – overwhelmingly Trump supporters – refuse to get vaccinated? But politics is an unforgiving business. Voters are used to blaming the man in the White House, especially when they face rising bills and daily costs as they do now. To turn things around, Biden can start with passing that key spending bill, even if it means stripping it of some cherished, and necessary, programmes. Voting rights legislation, to block those continuing Republican efforts to load the dice yet further in their own favour, is also a must. One way or another, Democrats have to go into the autumn midterms with a record to run on. Defeat would not guarantee the return of Trump two years later, but it would make it much more likely. That is a prospect to chill the blood of all those who care about America – and democracy.

1/8/2022,"Chester FC have been warned by police over a possible contravention of Covid regulations, after it was determined the club’s ground is in Wales. The Vanarama National League North club were summoned to a meeting with North Wales police on Friday, after staging two fixtures in front of spectators over the festive period.  Whereas there are no limits on crowds at events in England, a maximum of 50 people, plus players, can attend a sporting event in Wales. Chester recorded a crowd of 2,075 at their 2-2 draw with AFC Fylde last week. The club said they had been presented at the meeting with a joint letter from police and Flintshire County Council which outlined “potential breaches of Welsh coronavirus regulations at our fixtures on 28th December 2021 and 2nd January 2022”. They were also warned over future breaches if crowds were allowed in again. In a statement on the Chester FC website, the club said they “had been informed this was based upon direction from the Welsh government” and that they would be consulting lawyers on what steps to take next. Although Chester is an English city with a history that dates back to the establishment of a Roman fort in 79 AD, the border with Wales runs through the city. It splits the Sealand Road park and ride in half and cuts through the Chester West Employment Park. It also runs across the Deva Stadium, with the ticket office in England and the pitch in Wales. A crowd could legally gather in the car park for the fixture with Brackley Town next weekend but they would be in contravention of Welsh rules if they entered the ground. The inverse situation is being experienced by The New Saints, a Welsh Premier League side whose stadium is in Shropshire. The issue of divergent regulations has come to a head in Chester before, when the Deva Stadium car park was the proposed site of a drive-in cinema in 2020. Cestrian cineastes ultimately had to get their kicks elsewhere after organisers discovered they would be contravening Welsh Covid rules if they used the stadium’s toilets. A Welsh government spokesperson said: “Chester City Football Club’s stadium is in Wales therefore Welsh regulations apply.”",Sport/Football,English football club warned for breaking Welsh Covid rules,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/english-football-club-warned-for-breaking-welsh-covid-rules
1/8/2022,"Horses at opposite ends of their careers are centre stage at Sandown on Saturday and while the Grade One Tolworth Hurdle at 2.25pm (all times GMT) should be a useful pointer towards the Cheltenham Festival in March, the final of the Unibet Veterans’ Handicap Chase Series offers weekend punters a more immediate chance of a decent payout. Aso, second in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham in 2019 and a runner in the Gold Cup 10 months ago, is an obvious favourite, not least as his form behind Blaklion at Haydock in December was franked when the winner went in again last week.  In the debit column, though, Venetia Williams’s gelding is giving at least 9lb to the field and has done all his winning over fences at around two-and-a-half miles. A price around 11-4 looks too short and Indy Five (3.00) could be the best of several each-way alternatives at the other end of the weights at around 12-1. David Dennis’s 12-year-old is 1lb out of the handicap but has been competitive off higher marks in the past and was a comfortable winner in a useful time at Doncaster in December. He appreciated a return to front-running tactics there and should go well at a track where it often pays to be up with the pace. Wincanton 1.30: He did not beat a strong field but Planned Paradise had plenty to spare on his handicap debut at Newcastle last time and his time was decent in the circumstances. Sandown 1.50: Gunsight Ridge gave L’Homme Presse, a subsequent Grade Two winner, a serious race until the run-in at Exeter in December and is just 3lb higher here. Wincanton 2.05: A closely-handicapped field for the most part but Belle De Manech is the obvious candidate to improve having made a smooth switch to chasing at this track in December. Sandown 2.25: The visual impression of Constitution Hill’s successful hurdling debut over course and distance last time was backed up by the clock and it will be a big disappointment if the current second-favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle cannot justify his short price here. Wincanton 2.40: Getalead failed to land a four-timer at Taunton last time but was dropping back slightly in distance and ran as though he could still be competitive off his current mark over this trip. Wincanton 3.15: Occasional flashes of talent have been followed by disappointment for much of Mont Des Avaloir’s stop-start career, but few trainers can get one ready first time up like Paul Nicholls and he could get off the mark over fences at the fifth attempt here.

1/8/2022,"Once obscure diagnostic devices, lateral flow tests have had a rocky path to mainstream use, but some experts now view their rise to ubiquity as a “heroic” step in the fight against Covid-19 and say they could be here to stay. As the first wave of Covid crashed down in early 2020 and governments scrambled to secure PPE, ventilators and reagents for laboratory testing, behind the scenes some had already foreseen a role for the pregnancy test-style kits.  “We started thinking about it in late 2019 when we were at international trade shows where it was becoming a hot topic,” said David Campbell, the director of the Derby-based diagnostics company Surescreen, which has been in the lateral flow business for more than 25 years and brought one of the first antigen tests in Europe to market. “We’d done a lot of work on influenza and some work on Mers. We thought initially that it would be a niche product.” The first Covid lateral flow tests were designed to detect antibodies. At the time governments optimistically – and wrongly – hoped that proof of prior infection could act as a “freedom pass” allowing people to return to life as normal in the knowledge that they were immune to the virus. By April 2020 the UK government had announced the purchase of 17.5m lateral flow testing kits, describing them as a “gamechanger”. But this proved to be a misstep. “They absolutely didn’t work – they were awful,” Bell said. (He noted that Surescreen’s test was not among these.) “There were a lot of people running around trying to sell tests that didn’t work trying to make a fast buck. It was pretty scandalous. That was the starting point for lateral flow tests.” The orders were quietly cancelled, and Bell said one valuable lesson was the need for a robust validation process. The government established a group of Porton Down scientists, chaired by Bell, to validate tests for use. By early autumn 2020 many companies had switched their focus to antigen tests, which use synthetic antibodies to detect proteins from the virus itself. The UK government had also moved on to Operation Moonshot, which aimed to deliver millions of these kits to people’s homes. “Whenever I hear the word ‘moonshot’ from No 10 my heart sinks,” Bell said. “But the reality is that lateral flow tests have delivered. It’s been one of the more heroic moments of the pandemic.” This time the government fast-tracked a pilot of community testing of about 125,000 people in Liverpool using Innova’s lateral flow antigen test, and found that 897 people who did not know they had the virus tested positive and were stopped from spreading it further. However, the tests in the field missed 60% of infections in people who were self-swabbing, and even in those with high viral loads 30% of cases were missed. The results were controversial, with a vocal group of scientists warning that reliance on LFTs to open up schools and the economy risked providing false reassurance. “We were being attacked left, right and centre,” said Prof Iain Buchan, the chair in public health and clinical informatics at the University of Liverpool, who led the pilot. “It was almost a religious argument about whether you were for lateral flow testing or not. We even received death threats.” Buchan and others saw things differently. “Those who were criticising it were seeing it as a clinical diagnostic tool, not a public health tool,” he said. He and others argued that comparing the tests with the “gold standard” of laboratory-based PCR tests, which detect viral RNA, missed the point. Lateral flow tests aimed to spot people who would never have come forward for a PCR test in the first place and provide results at a fraction of the cost, in minutes rather than days. According to analysis by Buchan and colleagues, hospitalisations in Liverpool during the second wave were around a third lower than they would have been without the use of lateral flow tests. He said this reduction could not have been purely the result of people who tested positive self-isolating, but that doing the tests prompts wider behaviour changes such as other household members behaving more cautiously. Evidence also emerged that LFTs are most sensitive during the period when people have a high viral load, which has led some to argue they are a better test of when people are actually infectious. However, there is no established threshold for “infectiousness” and the sensitivity to low levels of antigens varies considerably between different brands of test. “The supposed ability of LFTs to detect people while they are ‘infectious’ seems to have become accepted dogma, but we know from our latest review that although pretty much all LFTs are very reliable when used in people with the very highest viral loads, there is considerable variation in assay performance at lower levels,” said Jac Dinnes, a senior researcher at the University of Birmingham who is leading a review of the accuracy of lateral flow tests. As case numbers fell in 2021, lateral flow tests also came under criticism for delivering false positives. This reflects a classic statistical conundrum: if you test positive, the chances that you really have Covid depends on not only the quality of the test but also the current prevalence of the virus. For instance, if an LFT delivers a false positive result for one in 1,000 tests at a time when just one in 1,000 people have Covid, the chances that someone with a positive is truly infected are only 50%. But if the prevalence is one in 10 people, as it was in London last week, that person can be 99% sure they are infected. The latter may be the clearest explanation for why lateral flow tests have come into their own at this particular juncture in the pandemic. Since the emergence of Omicron, case numbers in the UK have risen to such extraordinary levels that the issue of people having to isolate unnecessarily due to false positive results is negligible (and makes confirmatory PCR tests redundant). Vaccination has lessened the risk of severe disease and weakened the case for full national lockdowns. Yet we are still facing a pandemic that needs to be brought under control. Experts say the UK is in effect performing a huge public health trial on the extent to which mass testing can achieve this goal. “The way that these tests have gone from a tool intended to help diagnose, or at least triage, people with symptoms of Covid-19 to something recommended for daily use in people without symptoms is really quite the story,” said Dinnes. “I have not seen any published evidence from primary studies, as opposed to modelling studies, that fully supports this policy.” The jury is out on whether government advice to “flow before you go” will be recalled as another surreal episode of the pandemic, like Zoom quizzes and clapping for the NHS on our doorsteps, or whether it will become part of the fabric of daily life. Some say that as case rates come down, mass testing will be less valuable as a public health tool. Others believe that the pandemic will pave the way for LFTs for a wider range of respiratory viruses. In the future, they say, parents might do a quick test on their child before sending them to school when they wake up with a slight cough, or an elderly person might test for flu and take antiviral tablets before the symptoms really kick in. “There’s a world where these could be quite transformational … in which you could change the impact of respiratory viruses in society generally,” said Bell.",News/World news,The rise of lateral flow tests: are these ‘heroes’ of the pandemic here to stay?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/the-rise-of-lateral-flow-tests-are-these-heroes-of-the-pandemic-here-to-stay
1/8/2022,"With the start of a new year came a new haircut and suit for Boris Johnson as he fronted his first press conference of 2022 to reject calls for new coronavirus restrictions. The prime minister’s flagging Downing Street operation had looked in dire need of a reset before Christmas after months of sleaze scandals, anger at Covid laws and the shock resignation of his Brexit negotiator, David Frost.No 10 was hoping the festive break would stop talk of a Conservative leadership challenge and that Johnson’s decision to hold off restrictions would earn him a breather. However, any reprieve looked to be shortlived, with growing unease among his MPs about the impending cost of living crisis, a further onslaught of sleaze allegations over the No 11 flat refurbishment this week, and continuing inquiries into lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street – all against a backdrop of Omicron. Tory insiders believe a leadership relaunch full of hope and optimism would be difficult to pull off at this stage. These are some of the key challenges he will have to navigate in the months ahead, if he wants to avoid placing his political fate in the hands of his own backbenchers.  Johnson came down on the side of Tory backbenchers and against some medical and scientific voices calling for more restrictions in the new year. But the real crunch point will be later this month. Far from being mollified, his backbenchers are going further in their calls for Covid restrictions to be lessened or scrapped completely. Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, said: “Given it’s now endemic, we should be stopping all restrictions, stopping all testing outside of hospitals, we don’t need self-isolation any more. Get our economy moving, and save a fortune on testing by not doing it any more. And use these savings and extra revenue to cut the VAT on heating and also scrap the NICs [national insurance contributions] rise in April.” Bridgen is not alone in believing all curbs should end. Should Johnson want to introduce further restrictions or just continue with current ones on masks and working from home, he will face a battle with his own party. Johnson’s central idea guiding his premiership has been the principle of levelling up. However, it has been more than two years since the 2019 election and ideas in this area have been sorely lacking. Michael Gove currently holds the levelling up brief and is charged with bringing key ideas from the Johnson administration to life. If it is disappointing or too technocratic, Johnson will be open to charges that his premiership is lacking in focus and fresh policies. “What are we going to do with the next two years to convince people it was worth voting for us?” as one MP put it. Johnson is coming under growing pressure over the price of energy with warnings that bills may rise by 50% to keep suppliers afloat when the price cap is reviewed by the regulator, Ofgem, in February. No 10 and the Treasury are examining possible mitigations but are focusing their attention on ways to help the poorest, such as increasing the warm homes discount, rather than a measure that would ease the cost for everyone – slashing VAT on gas and electricity bills. This is particularly tricky for Johnson as he boasted in 2016 that scrapping the sales tax on utility bills would be possible after Brexit – and Labour has taken up the cause with gusto since then. Calls from the Telegraph-reading right of the party for the NICs rise to be cancelled will also sting Johnson with the criticism that the move was fundamentally unconservative. It remains to be seen whether he will manage to hold his ground as the moment approaches when voters will really feel pain in their pockets. The revelation that No 10 held gatherings during lockdown from as early as May 2020 to Christmas parties last year severely hit the prime minister’s poll ratings. This in turn has enraged backbenchers, less over the rule-flouting but more over the carelessness and attempted cover-ups. The inquiry, now led by Cabinet Office veteran Sue Gray, has been collecting testimony. Those who know her methods believe she may find ways of being critical without causing serious damage to the prime minister. Nevertheless, anything that keeps the lockdown parties in the headlines is bad news for the Conservatives’ popularity. There has been persistent speculation about a possible reshaping of Johnson’s operation. Some Tory MPs believe there will have to be a “sacrifice” for missteps over the lockdown party furore and many would like to see a return to the ascendancy of the Brexit-focused wing of the party, which is now underrepresented since the departure of Dominic Cummings and Frost. Tories have long grumbled about the prime minister’s chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, a former banker and civil servant, who they believe is insufficiently political. If Johnson does decide to go for a spring reshuffle coinciding with good news on a waning Covid wave, it could be accompanied by a staff shake-up. The May elections are a key point for assessing how the government and opposition are doing with voters. Robert Hayward, a Tory peer and elections expert, said all eyes will be on whether the Tories can hang on to key London boroughs, including Johnson’s own territory of Hillingdon, as well as Westminster and Wandsworth – and equally whether Labour’s Keir Starmer has enough appeal to take them. He said the metropolitan elections were also worth observing to see whether the Tories are holding firm or receding in crucial red wall areas across the north of England. The performance relative to other years – bearing in mind Johnson is running a mid-term government after 10 years of Tory rule – are always a litmus test in the minds of MPs. “My view about political leaders is that you lose power by attrition. There are very few that lose power on one specific event,” said Hayward.",News/Politics,Hairy times ahead for Johnson?

More than 2,300 flights were canceled in the US on Friday morning. Schools and offices in the north-east were shuttered, by a fierce overnight snowstorm, if not only by the Omicron coronavirus surge, and parts of the north-west were under an avalanche warning.  No sooner had gigantic delays on the east coast I-95 road artery in Virginia been cleared earlier this week caused by weather and crashes, a more than 20-car pile-up in more stormy weather stranded drivers for hours in Kentucky. Tens of millions nationwide were hit by hazardous weather in the past 24 hours, ABC News reported, while a whopping 37 states faced winter weather alerts by Thursday evening. In New England and the larger north-east region, the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted a “quick hitting nor’easter” storm would cause “disruptive snowfall” for the end of the week, with 4-8in falling in parts of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine. New York City received a quick dump of snow overnight, with New Yorkers waking up early Friday to the sound of snow plows for the first time this winter, followed by bluebird skies and sunshine on the freshly-dusted landscape. Public schools in Boston and Washington DC declared snow days Friday, while federal offices in the DC area closed amid the winter weather. In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont shuttered executive branch state offices to the public, and residents were advised to stay home.

1/8/2022,"Faced with a popular uprising, Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has responded in hardline fashion. He has ordered a security crackdown, called protesters “terrorists” and said those who take to the streets deserve to be wiped out. Tokayev has also cryptically hinted that “foreigners” are behind the unrest. It is unsurprising that the veteran politician and diplomat has taken a leaf from the Kremlin’s conspiratorial playbook. Tokayev spent his formative years in the service of the Soviet foreign ministry. After graduating from school in Almaty – the scene of the worst disturbances this week – he studied foreign relations at a Moscow state institute.  Tokayev specialised in Chinese. He mastered the language, joined the far-east division of the Soviet foreign ministry and spent much of the 1980s at Moscow’s embassy in Beijing. When the USSR fell apart, he quickly became an adviser to Nursultan Nazarbayev, leader of the newly independent Kazakhstan. It was Toyakyev who persuaded other nations to recognise Kazakhstan diplomatically. China was especially enthusiastic. Narzabayev rewarded Tokayev by making him deputy foreign minister, as well as interpreter-cum-adviser on official delegations to Beijing. By 1999 Tokayev became prime minister and in 2002 foreign minister. A staunch Nazarbayev loyalist, he was responsible for improving relations with Kazakhstan’s three key partners – Russia, China and the US. He met regularly with US envoys and helped Kazakhstan relinquish its inherited communist-era nuclear bombs. Some of Tokayev’s private comments now seem ironic. At a 2005 lunch he told the US ambassador a popular Orange Revolution of the kind seen in other post-Soviet Republics was “unlikely” in Kazakhstan. The country, he claimed, was committed to “political reform” and decentralisation, according to a leaked US cable. Further high positions followed. He became speaker and then chairman of Kazakhstan’s senate. When Nazarbayev retired in 2019 – formally at least – Tokayev succeeded him as president. Two-and-a-half years into the job, he is facing a crisis graver than anything seen by his authoritarian predecessor. Tokayev’s decision to invite in Russian troops to restore order reverses years in which Kazakhstan has cautiously sought to tread an independent foreign policy, triangulating between Moscow, Washington and Beijing. From now on, relations with the west will be cooler. Those with Russia suddenly appear more fragile and subservient. Tokayev’s family connections are bound up with Soviet history. His father, a writer of detective stories, fought in the second world war – the Great Patriotic War, as Russia calls it. His mother was a university languages teacher. He is divorced with a son, Timur. His hobbies include reading novels, memoirs and books about politics. According to his official biography, Tokayev – now 68 – has written 10 books on international relations. He also “supports a healthy lifestyle” and was the head of Kazakhstan’s table tennis association.",News/World news,Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: veteran Kazakh diplomat faces grave crisis ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/kassym-jomart-tokayev-veteran-kazakh-diplomat-faces-grave-crisis
1/8/2022,"David Mamet sent his script of Glengarry Glen Ross to Harold Pinter and asked what was wrong with it. Pinter said: “Nothing. All it needs is a production.” And it certainly got one of those. Pinter had already passed the script on to Bill Bryden, who has died aged 79, a colleague and fellow associate at the National Theatre in the Peter Hall era, and Bryden’s 1983 landmark production of seedy deals among the estate agents of Chicago took off like a rocket.  Bryden had arrived at the new National on the South Bank in the mid-1970s as one of Hall’s chief allies and most distinguished directors. He created an ensemble company within the NT that has never been equalled, an unapologetically macho, brazenly hard-drinking troupe who ripped through Mamet, Eugene O’Neill and the medieval Mystery Plays of York and Wakefield as rewritten by poet Tony Harrison, creating theatrical events of high voltage and poetic density. The Mysteries, as they became known, comprised three plays over eight years – The Passion (1977), The Nativity (1980) and Doomsday (1985) – in the small Cottesloe auditorium with promenade audiences, folk-rock music, and a hand-picked company of actors – often known as the rugby team – including Jack Shepherd, Dave Hill, Brenda Blethyn, Robert Stephens and Brian Glover (who played God in a flat cap on a forklift truck). The director John Dexter described the show as “the high point of the National’s first decade on the South Bank”. It was the high point, too, of Bryden’s style of popular ensemble playing, fitted out with rudimentary but spectacular design and lighting by regular collaborators such as William Dudley, Hayden Griffin, Andy Phillips and Rory Dempster, and writers Harrison and Keith Dewhurst. It was performed among the audience under a constellation of twinkling orange braziers and lanterns, transferred to the reopened Lyceum theatre in 1985, almost half a century after the venue hosted its last play, John Gielgud’s 1939 Hamlet, and was filmed by Channel 4. Bryden and his company produced 12 shows in the Cottesloe, including a second saga of magical conjuration, Flora Thompson’s Lark Rise to Candleford (adapted by Dewhurst), making contemporary joy and tragedy from a vanished agrarian world in 1870s Oxfordshire. He had already established himself at the Royal Court, where, as a dashing, always voluble figure in the early 1970s, he brought a bracing Glaswegian fizz and glamour to new work and began assembling that glorious roster of colleagues that travelled with him down the years. His musical affiliations were with the folk-rock of Steeleye Span and the Albion Band, singers Maddy Prior and Martin Carthy, and composer John Tams. Before arriving at the National, he was an associate director at the Edinburgh Lyceum, where he directed three extraordinary “folk” plays: his own Willie Rough (1972), about his maternal grandfather, a Clyde docker; The Bevellers (1973), by actor Roddy McMillan, recalling his days in the glass-bevelling business; and Benny Lynch (1974), about a world champion boxer on skid row in the 1930s. The latter, which he also wrote, was a pet project he was hoping to translate to the large screen, but it never happened. There was a moment when it seemed Bryden would reignite the long-nurtured dream of a Scottish National Theatre. But when Hall came calling, he upped sticks and headed south. After 10 years at the NT, he was appointed head of drama at BBC Scotland (1984-93) – he had served on the board since 1979 – where his production triumphs included his own film, The Holy City (1985), a Glaswegian Easter Passion, and John Byrne’s delirious, delightful Tutti Frutti, (1987) starring Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson and Richard Wilson in a saga of low-rent rock and rollers on the road. Bryden was born in Greenock, near Glasgow, the son of George Bryden, a bus driver and engineer, and his wife, Catherine (nee Rough), a shop assistant. He was educated at Hillend primary school and Greenock high school, finding work as a trainee at Scottish Television in 1963 and directing his first play, Shaw’s Misalliance, at the Belgrade, Coventry, in 1965. His first London productions were at the Royal Court, where he was William Gaskill’s assistant for two years before asserting himself with a buoyant account of Keith Dewhurst’s Corunna (British soldiers fighting the French in 1808), Bertolt Brecht’s Baby Elephant with Bob Hoskins, and Edward Bond’s Passion (1971), commissioned by CND for Easter Sunday in Alexandra Palace. In Edinburgh, at the festival in 1975, he wrote (and directed) the libretto for composer Robin Orr’s Hermiston, based on a last unfinished novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. Alongside the long-term project of The Mysteries, he and Dewhurst gave an ebullient account of The World Turned Upside Down (1978), based on Christopher Hill’s English civil war book, and he directed three remarkable American pieces: Mamet’s earlier American Buffalo, Michael Herr’s Dispatches, adapted by Bryden and the company from Herr’s devastating reports from the Vietnam war, and O’Neill’s four short plays of the sea, The Long Voyage Home. He also served up fine revivals of O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh (Jack Shepherd as a mesmerising Hickey), Arthur Miller’s The Crucible (Mark McManus as John Proctor) and Stacy Keach in Hughie, also by O’Neill. Keach gave a towering performance as a wiped-out gambler returning, after a five-day bender, to a favoured haunt of a shabby hotel, where the old night porter, Hughie, has just died. Keach would feature in a mid-western movie about Jesse James and his gang, which Bryden proudly co-scripted, Walter Hill’s The Long Riders (1980), alongside his brother James Keach, Dennis Quaid and his brother, Randy, and three Carradines – David, Keith and Robert. Bryden loved westerns, and all the great Hollywood epics, and wrote a play for the National, Old Movies (1977), in which an ageing producer, played by EG Marshall, is trying to set up a biblical extravaganza. His larger exploits on the NT’s Olivier stage were not always successful – the official opening production of Carlo Goldoni’s Il Campiello, in the presence of the Queen, in 1976, was a disaster. But he made good in the Olivier in 1983 with Dewhurst’s great rendering of the episodic mock grandeur in Cervantes’ Don Quixote, with a gloriously delusional Paul Scofield riding his Rosinante as a knackered penny farthing tricycle, oblivious to the attentive blustering of Tony Haygarth’s Sancho Panza. And there were two unforgettably spectacular events on his home territory of the old Harland & Wolff shipyard in Govan. The Ship (1990) made drama both cinematic and realistic of the last great liner to be built on the Clyde; the ship literally slid from its timber supports away from the audience, who were abandoned to celebrate/lament the end of an era. And The Big Picnic (1994) was the Starlight Express of the first world war, the incredible vision of the Angel of Mons leading the risen dead from the muddy battlefields back home to Govan. Along the way there were more fine productions, such as the best I have seen of Ivan Turgenev’s A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and John Hurt at the Albery (now the Noël Coward) in 1994; a return to the National in 2001 with The Good Hope, a Dutch classic about the fishing industry, adapted by Lee Hall, a salty socialist tragedy with Frances de la Tour; and more bar-room poetic blather from Tennessee Williams in Small Craft Warnings at the Arcola, Dalston, in 2008. His work in opera was limited but critically acclaimed: at Covent Garden, he directed Parsifal in 1988 and a beautiful version of Leoš Janáček’s The Cunning Little Vixen in 1990. And for the ENO, he directed the Olivier-award winning The Silver Tassie (2000), with music by Mark-Anthony Turnage and a libretto by Amanda Holden. Bryden did not enjoy the best of health in the past 10 years, but he never stopped planning and writing. He was made CBE in 1993 and received honorary fellowships from Rose Bruford drama school, Queen Margaret College (now Queen Margaret University) in Edinburgh and the University of Stirling. His first marriage, to Deborah Morris in 1971, ended in divorce in 1988. Bryden is survived by their two children, Dillon and Kate, and by his second wife, Angela Douglas (the widow of Kenneth More), whom he lived with from 1988 and married in 2009.

1/8/2022,"Boris Johnson’s former top adviser Dominic Cummings has alleged there was a lockdown-breaking party in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 after an emailed invitation to “socially distanced drinks”. Cummings, who left No 10 in November that year, said people were invited to the gathering by a senior Downing Street official who he said should have been removed from their job because of failings over Covid.  In a lengthy blogpost, he claimed he had warned at the time that it “seemed to be against the rules and should not happen”. He said this was in writing and could be uncovered by an inquiry into lockdown-busting parties currently being conducted by the Cabinet Office official Sue Gray. Cummings went on to allege there were other gatherings in 2021, after he left Downing Street, and that Johnson was aware of them. The former aide outed himself as one of the people seen in a photograph published by the Guardian last month showing the prime minister and his wife, Carrie, sitting around a table with wine and cheese with two No 10 staff members on Friday 15 May 2020, five days before the new gathering alleged by Cummings. A total of 19 people were gathered in the garden, according to the 15 May photo, and sources told the Guardian there was a celebratory atmosphere that evening after a press conference. One source described it as a “wine and pizza party” that went on late into the evening. As part of a joint investigation with the Independent, a source said the prime minister had told one of those present – drinking inside Downing Street on the same evening - that they deserved their drink for “beating back” the virus. However, Cummings claimed in his latest blog that they were chatting after having meetings, that it was not a “party” or “organised drinks” that was shown in the photograph, and that he left shortly after it was taken, at about 7.15pm. After the meeting, he said, “the PM and I continued talking as it broke up. Someone brought a bottle of wine out to the table. It may have been Martin [Reynolds, the prime minister’s principal private secretary] but I think it was the PM himself who went inside as I was packing stuff up and brought out wine. We carried on chatting about Covid, about domestic priorities, and about how to sort out the Cabinet Office which had totally collapsed. Shortly after Carrie joined us.” He argued that the prime minister’s then fiancee was allowed under the rules to be in the garden in her own home. At the time, social mixing between households was limited to two people who could only meet outdoors and at a distance of at least 2 metres. Schools were still shut and pubs and restaurants were closed, with strict controls on social mixing. More people had been allowed to return to their workplaces but guidance said social distancing of 2 metres should be followed at all times and “only absolutely necessary participants should attend meetings and should maintain 2-metre separation throughout”. Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, has described the picture as “a slap in the face of the British public”, adding: “The prime minister consistently shows us he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. Alleged drinking and partying late into the evening [at No 10] when the rest of us were only recently getting one daily walk.” The prime minister has faced a string of allegations of partying and socialising in No 10 while Covid restrictions were in place. He was forced to order a civil service inquiry, though its head, Simon Case, had to step down over allegations of his own Christmas party. No 10 has been approached for comment.",News/Politics,Dominic Cummings makes new claim of party in No 10 garden in lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/07/dominic-cummings-says-another-party-was-held-in-no-10-garden-in-lockdown
1/8/2022,"Stephen Colbert observed the first anniversary of the 6 January assault on the Capitol on Thursday evening, a year after he reacted to the insurrection on live television. “The thing I remember from that day is how shocked I was at this grotesque tragedy,” he said, recalling how the Late Show writing staff scrapped a planned monologue on the certification of Biden’s victory after seeing footage of the siege during a script rewrite Zoom meeting.  Colbert echoed Joe Biden’s furious remarks to acknowledge the occasion, in which the president invited Americans to recall the events of 6 January and lamented the rioters “defecating in the hallways”. “Defecating: that is a very delicate, presidential and high-minded way to describe Maga maniacs smearing poop on the walls,” said the Late Show host, imitating the president’s voice: “These ignoble miscreants absconded with Madam Speaker’s rostrum, set alight their cannabis cigarillos and besmirched these hallowed corridors with their human detritus.” Then Biden “took the gloves off”: “The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He’s done so because he values power over principle. Because he sees his own interest as more important than his country’s interest, than America’s interest. And because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our constitution. He can’t accept he lost.” “Hell yes! Tell it like it is, Joe!” Colbert cheered. “I loved that speech today, truly a powerful speech. That is the Joe Biden I remember, that is the Joe Biden we stole this election for – I mean voted for,” he joked. Not everyone marked the occasion with solemnity; only two House Republicans attended a memorial service in Congress for the Capitol police officers who died during the violence. “The other Republican legislators chose to re-enact January 6th by hiding in fear,” Colbert quipped. But the former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, “and instead of discussing their now public pants-crapping, terrified text exchange from a year back, Meadows complained in advance about how the media would cover it”, Colbert said. Said Meadows: “You’re right to point out that tomorrow is going to be spent on January 6th.” “Keen analysis,” Colbert deadpanned. “Meadows went on to predict the next day would be spent on January 7th, the day after might focus on January 8th, and by the weekend, we could see numbers as high as 9 or 10.” On the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon also cheered Biden’s address on the insurrection, which had a “high school principal after a food fight vibe”. “He’s not just a former president,” Biden said of Donald Trump. “He’s a defeated former president.” In other news, BMW unveiled a new SUV with the capability to change color, and “experts say it’s going to revolutionize the way you forget where you parked your car,” Fallon quipped. The appliances brand Kohler also announced a new luxury product: a bath that produces fog, to create a home spa. “To make it even more spa-like, the bath also emits a hologram of a naked old guy who sits two feet away from you,” Fallon added. And Taco Bell revealed a new subscription service that will send people a taco every day for $10 a month. “Well, looks like we’re about to go through another toilet paper shortage,” Fallon joked.",Arts/Culture,Colbert on Biden’s 6 January address: ‘Hell yes!

1/8/2022,"‘A global shift will occur when each individual finds the courage to awaken from the mass amnesia.” Yes, I read the personal manifesto of Novak Djokovic’s wellness guru so you don’t have to. It is no secret that the world’s No 1 celebrity Covid outlaw, currently awaiting his fate in an agreeably everyday Melbourne hotel, is a long-term student of somebody called Chervin Jafarieh, described, on his own website, as “one of the most respected and influential health experts in the world”. Jafarieh is a familiar type, the magnetic personality, the handsome and piercing spirit guide who accepts all major credit cards and looks like he might smell of musk and whale-song and concentrated human-power while he stands slightly too close you in the lift.  The manifesto is lush and persuasive and, frankly, bang on about lots of stuff. Novak’s guy is worried about pollution and climate change, also “militarism, urbanization, carbon combustion, mining of metals and toxic materials, manufacturing of chemicals and biological poisons”. Mainly he’s obsessed with intake and the body, and this seems to be the thing about Djokovic’s vaccine hesitancy, at least in public. Djokovic has staged his own super-spreader event, has provided an anti-science role model, but he has also bought ventilators for hospitals, set up a Covid fund and done generous, charitable, believer-type things. This is not alien lizard stuff. It’s not the great human cull or the fake-a-demic. Instead the resistance seems to come from somewhere else, from sunlit pagodas where magnetic people in crisp linen robes talk about their energy, their aura, their yacht, from a place of mind power and blood purity, of bamboo silica supplements and chocolate-flavoured Organic Longevity Mushrooms. For Djokovic physical control is a kind of religion in itself, the superpower that transformed him into a miracle of sporting middle age, a marvel of twang and flex and tensile energy. This is an all-time athlete who has kicked gluten, dairy, sugar and meat, who starts the day with celery juice and yoga before dawn, who believes it is us, those still slaughtering animals, eating chemicals, pumping out the carbon, who are, frankly, the problem, who says things like “our entire body is a harmonic system that is perfectly managing all its metabolic functions”. So, is he going to have that man-made chemical injected into his bicep, the one he uses to dole out his hyper-organic uber tennis? The same substance unhealthy, McNugget-quaffing people like me and you keep telling him is species-duty? No. No he’s not. And yes it’s annoying and weird and based on a spectrum of Übermensch pseudo-science. But being weird isn’t, as yet, a crime, just as not taking a vaccine isn’t a crime, even when you combine it with the maddening overclass arrogance of trying to enter Australia under a medical exemption, rather than just staying away out of basic good manners. And really, why even go into all this? Why try to humanise and understand the world’s current most divisive athlete? Firstly, because it’s better than the default options of blanket condemnatory rage or unquestioning hero-worship. And also because there are two points that can easily get lost. The first is that sport is being used as an amplifier here, the stage for an ugly and manipulative piece of political theatre. How dumb is Novak Djokovic? Dumb enough to allow himself to be used as a pawn by Scott Morrison, an organically reared dead cat hurled on to the table as a welcome election-year distraction. Morrison offered a revealing aside during a TV interview this week. Yes, the Aussie PM confirmed, chuckling quietly, his border force does operate on intelligence, hunches and previous public statements. And so, this is, by extension, a showy piece of opportunism, a staged humiliation. Morrison has been under pressure over fragile administration, an absence of testing kits, a wildfire of new Covid cases. How to appear both strong and big on detail at a single stroke? Enter, yogurt boy. And all the while positions are entrenched. Nobody learns or changes their mind. Why am I even trying to explain and humanise the anti-vaccine creed of the world’s most-reviled refusenik? I guess because the most radical thing you can currently do is try to see both sides. Personally I’m a vaccine ultra. Hook me up baby. Protect me and my immediate contacts with the best available science. I’ll swallow it and (probably) fail to run a mile. But it is also vital to understand that some might have another view, that being wary about what you put into your body is not beyond comprehension. Sports people live strange cosseted lives. But in the UK, at least, the low take-up of Premier League footballers also reflects precisely the distrust and vulnerability to “alternative truths” of all people their age, particularly those from economically and socially disadvantaged groups. Coercion and scolding, going on about ignorant millionaires: this gets us nowhere. This is the most practical point. Sport really does need clarity and forward planning or it will continue to magnify these problems, to be weaponised by those with agenda. Most obviously all sporting bodies need to resist the urge to meddle and lobby on the issue of who gets to enter a particular country. This applies to various upcoming events, from the French Open, which offers the chance for a reprise of the current theatre, to Chelsea’s trip to Lille in the Champions League. Beyond that we have the tricky prospect of the 2022 Fifa World Cup. The latest word, not yet publicly confirmed, is that unvaccinated players will receive an exemption to the rules in Qatar, which demands the jab. Perhaps all involved are hoping this will simply go away. The lessons of Melbourne and the trials of tennis-Jesus are that without clarity sport will remain a megaphone for rage and confusion; just another note, as Chervin himself might put it, in the great amnesia.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic and trying to understand the divisive tennis-Jesus | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/07/novak-djokovic-and-trying-to-understand-the-divisive-tennis-jesus
1/8/2022,"Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! That was the noise of Wor Eddie How-ay’s massive brass balls banging loudly against each other, as he explained the reasons behind Kieran Trippier completing his move from Spanish champions and Big Cup contenders Atlético Madrid to Newcastle United earlier on Friday. Currently second from bottom of the Premier League but now the World’s Richest Football Club after their purchase by a Public Investment Fund that is in no way connected to a Saudi prince responsible for all manner of atrocities, Newcastle have got their anticipated January trolley dash off to what looks like an eminently sensible start by acquiring the England full-back. It is a statement signing that has prompted much delight on Tyneside, while prompting others to wonder what on earth it could possibly be that convinced Trippier to leave the Spanish capital for a club that has managed to win one league game of 19 so far this season.  While more cynical football emails than The Fiver might be tempted to argue that Trippier had almost certainly inked his two-and-a-half year deal for financial reasons – a not-inconsiderable pay rise of £42,000 per week that nobody in their right mind could blame him for accepting – Wor Eddie was at pains to stress that nothing could be further from the truth. “Kieran hasn’t come for the financial benefits of the contract,” he honked, maintaining the commendably straight face that served him so well when he insisted he had no opinion whatsoever on working for a man renowned for using extremely violent measures for “silencing” dissidents at home and abroad. “He’s come for the club and for the challenge that the team faces at this time, but also for the longer term vision.” That vision, after the shorter term one of winning seven or eight games of the next 19 and avoiding relegation to the Championship, is of course the accrual of Premier League and Big Cup titles in the coming years, triumphs you’d bet your bottom dollar neither Howe nor Trippier, 32, will still be at Newcastle to see. Nevertheless, in the usual fit of fan-pleasing posturing, Trippier plastered a rictus they-are-treating-me-extremely-well grin across his chops and weirdly pointed to the sponsor’s logo on his left sleeve for his unveiling, before singing loudly from the same hymn sheet as the manager. “I came here to help the team, the project, everything about it,” he tooted. “If people say it’s about money then everyone’s entitled to their opinion but I’ve got my reasons. I know my reasons why and that’s not one of them.” Trippier’s explanation is ultimately moot because the fact of the matter is that the majority of Newcastle fans don’t give two hoots why he has signed for their club, only that he’s there. Somewhat strangely, the supporters who used to be so vocal in their disapproval of tyrannical multi-billionaire owners … well, they no longer seem to be quite so vocal.
