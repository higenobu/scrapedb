4/5/2022,"Ukrainian forces have claimed to have downed a Russian jet worth £38million as they continue to defend their country from Vladimir Putin's invasion. Images released by Ukrainian Armed Forces on Sunday showed the burning remains of an Su-35 fighter shot down near the city of Izyum, in the Kharkiv region. It is believed to be the first Su-35 which the Ukrainian forces have shot down since Putin ordered his troops to invade on 24 February. Video of a Russian soldier reported to be the pilot was shared on social media, showing him kneeling near the burning wreckage, although this was unverified. Ukrainian MP Anton Gerashchenko claimed the pilot ejected from the aircraft as it was going down and was captured as he tried to flee. The Su-35 is a twin-engine supermaneuverable fighter jet, bought into the Russian service in 2014. The 22m meter long aircraft can reach a top speed of 2,400kmh (1,500mph), and carries a number of weapons including rockets, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. Russia is believed to have suffered significant losses since the conflict began, including thousands of soldiers and huge numbers of equipment. Watch: Volodymyr Zelensky sends appeal to Grammys over war in Ukraine Latest figures from local news in Ukraine have estimated over 18,000 troops have died, along with 143 planes, 644 tanks and thousands of other vehicles. While the figures cannot be independently verified, Western officials have pointed towards evidence of significant losses on the Russia side as they come up against stiff opposition. It was claimed over the weekend that two Russian soldiers died after eating pies laced with poison which Ukrainian citizens ""treated"" them with. The troops from the third Motor Rifle Division, are said to have died instantly after locals in Izium ""gifted"" them the pies. Another 28 soldiers have reportedly been rushed to hospital, and hundreds more are said to be suffering ""severe illness"" from poisoned food and drink given to them. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence Intelligence wrote on social media on Saturday: ""Ukrainians resist the occupiers by all available means. ""According to available information, local residents of the Izium district (Kharkiv region) 'treated' Russians from the third Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Federation with poisoned pies. ""As a result, two occupiers died at once, another 28 were taken to the intensive care unit. Their current state is being clarified."" Putin has been accused of carrying out a genocide in Ukraine, after Ukraine's Ministry of Defence released images on Sunday showing what was left behind in the city of Bucha following a retreat of Russian forces.  Footage showed bodies left lying in the street, some with the hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Ukrainian authorities have claimed 410 civilians were killed in Bucha and Irpin, with mass graves being dug for the victims. In Motyzhyn, around 20 miles west of the city of Bucha, the mayor and her family were reportedly discovered in a mass grave. Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria Olexander Scherba said Olga Sukhenko was found buried with her husband and son. Of the 20 people found in the put, some bore the marks of torture, authorities said, including broken arms and fingers. Journalists who have visited the area since the Russians retreat have said there is ""clear evidence"" of war crimes being left behind, including that of torture and rape. Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of torturing and executing hundreds of people in a Facebook post after the bodies were discovered. “I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel,” Zelensky said. “What did they do? Why were they killed?” “War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday,” he added.",News/Yahoo News UK,Wreckage of £38m Russian fighter jet pictured burning in field,https://news.yahoo.com/wreckage-of-38-m-russian-fighter-jet-pictured-burning-in-field-090219348.html
4/5/2022,"A Watergate prosecutor compared Donald Trump's phone-log gap to the gap in a Richard Nixon call. She said Trump's gap might've hidden something more serious than what experts think Nixon omitted. ""A lot can be said in 457 minutes,"" Jill Wine-Banks wrote of Trump's call-log gap. A Watergate prosecutor on Saturday compared Donald Trump's missing January 6, 2021, phone logs to a minutes-long gap in one of Richard Nixon's calls related to the scandal that cost Nixon his presidency — and she concluded that Trump's case had the potential to be far more serious. ""It is often said that Nixon's cover-up was worse than his underlying crime. The reverse is potentially true for Trump,"" Jill Wine-Banks wrote in an op-ed article published by NBC News. ""Trump's records gap is 25 times as long as Nixon's, but his alleged crime could be incalculably worse,"" she concluded. Trump is under scrutiny over a gap of seven hours and 37 minutes in the White House's call logs on the day of the Capitol riot. The absence of these call records has also prompted the House January 6 committee to investigate what one unnamed lawmaker has called a ""possible cover-up."" ""A lot can be said in 457 minutes,"" Wine-Banks wrote. ""Comparisons to the 18.5-minute gap in a crucial President Richard Nixon recording were immediately obvious to me."" Wine-Banks, who cross-examined Nixon's secretary in 1973 about the gap, also observed she was ""not the only to make that connection"" between Trump and Nixon. ""First, Nixon's gap seems — based on my experience and other experts — to have been a deliberate erasure,"" she wrote. ""Is Trump's? We don't have enough evidence to say for sure yet, but the missing chunk certainly appears deliberate."" Wine-Banks said the missing information in Trump's case seemed ""suspicious"" and prompted a ""series of urgent follow-up questions."" ""It is unlikely, even incredible, that no one called in to the president for 457 minutes during a crisis when he was in the White House,"" she wrote. ""Even calls that go unanswered in the White House should be listed on official logs."" Wine-Banks added that while the gap in Nixon's conversation was ""about covering up a third-rate burglary,"" any calls that Trump made during the insurrection were notable given scrutiny about whether he broke any laws while trying to cling to power after losing to Joe Biden in the 2020 US election. The Watergate scandal centered on the Nixon administration's efforts to cover up its involvement in a 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in Washington, DC. The scandal led to Nixon's resignation from the presidency in August 1974. Parallels were often drawn between Watergate and the numerous scandals that plagued the White House during Trump's presidency.   Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,A Watergate prosecutor says the 457-minute gap in Trump's White House call logs could be masking 'incalculably worse' behavior than Nixon's,https://news.yahoo.com/watergate-prosecutor-says-457-minute-032025094.html
4/5/2022,"A video appears to show a UK-made missile shooting down a Russian helicopter in Ukraine. The UK is said to have sent a team of Starstreak operators to a nearby country to train Ukrainians. Russia's ambassador to the UK said British weapons supplied to Ukraine were ""legitimate targets."" Reports indicate a British-made anti-aircraft missile was used to shoot down a Russian helicopter in Ukraine for the first time. A Times of London report on Friday said a video was thought to show the Starstreak high-velocity missile system striking a Russian Mi-28N attack helicopter over the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. The video, whose authenticity Insider couldn't confirm, appears to show a missile hitting a helicopter, causing its tail to snap off. Starstreak is Britain's most advanced operated portable missile system, and the UK sent a consignment to Ukraine in March along with another shipment of Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapons, or NLAWs. An unnamed British Ministry of Defense source and other ""senior defense-industry sources"" told The Times they believed the video showed Starstreak in action. The weapon is guided onto its target by three laser-beam darts, according to The Times. The missile accelerates to 3,000 mph. It can be fired from a stand or shoulder launcher and can strike targets up to 4 miles away, the paper said. Because of the complexity of using it, troops must have 1,000 successful hits on a simulator before they are allowed to launch a live missile, The Times said. To help Ukrainians master the weapon, the British Ministry of Defense sent a team of Starstreak operators and a simulator to a secret location in a neighboring country for training, The Times reported. Though British operators had planned to spend two to three weeks intensively training Ukrainian troops, its use this week would suggest soldiers had learned how to use it in just one or two weeks, the paper said. The British Ministry of Defense source told The Times the anti-aircraft system had been deployed for nearly a week. Russia's ambassador to the UK told the Russian news agency TASS on Saturday that British weapons supplies to Ukraine were ""legitimate targets"" for the Russian army. Ambassador Andrey Kelin said supplying arms such as Starstreak missiles was ""destabilizing."" ""They exacerbate the situation, making it even bloodier. Apparently, those are new, high-precision weapons,"" Kelin told the news agency. ""Naturally, our armed forces will view them as a legitimate target if those supplies get through the Ukrainian border.""

Olha Sukhenko, leader of the village of Motyzhyn, together with her husband Ihor Sukhenko and their son Oleksandr, were taken captive by Russian forces two to three days before troops left the village, according to locals. Their bodies were discovered on Monday, covered in sand. Vadym Tokar, head of the Makariv village council which neighbors Motyzhyn, said: ""The bodies are still lying there, we can't get them out because there is a suspicion that they are mined."" Evidence of widespread atrocities committed by Russian troops has emerged in recent days as soldiers withdrew from Kyiv and the surrounding regions. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence released a series of harrowing images on Sunday from the town of Bucha, showing bodies left lying in the street, some with the hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Locals said some victims were shot in the eyes by Russian soldiers. On Monday, US President Joe Biden called fro Vladimir Putin to be prosecuted for war crimes. ""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden told reporters, saying the Russian president ""is a war criminal"" and there should be ""a war crimes trial"". Mass graves have been uncovered, and media who have visited the area since the Russians retreat have said there is ""clear evidence"" of war crimes, including torture and rape. The destruction has led to accusations that Vladimir Putin is carrying out a genocide. Russia has denied that its troops have been targeting civilians, saying reports of mass slaughter were ""staged"" to sully Russia's name. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, spoke to reporters as he revealed the bodies believed to be the Sukhenko, family. ""There have been Russian occupiers here. They tortured and murdered the whole family of the village head,"" he said. ""The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery. ""These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family. They will be responsible for this."" Motyzhyn sits around 30 miles west of Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities have claimed 410 civilians were killed in Bucha and Irpin.

Why were they killed?” “War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday,” he added. The UK and allies in the European Union, are said to be preparing to deliver another round of sanctions on Russia following mounting evidence of war crimes committed by its forces in Ukraine. In a statement published on Monday, the European Council said: “The European Union condemns in the strongest possible terms the reported atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in a number of occupied Ukrainian towns, that have now been liberated. “The massacres in the town of Bucha and other Ukrainian towns will be inscribed in the list of atrocities committed on European soil."" Boris Johnson vowed on Monday that Putin will “never conquer” Ukraine. The PM wrote on Twitter: “Putin will never break the spirit of Ukraine’s people or conquer their homeland. “Ukraine will rise again and take her place among free and sovereign nations once more.” On Sunday, Russia's defense ministry said in a statement all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging crimes by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops.

4/5/2022,"YouTuber Brendan Jones, one half of the Goal Guys vlogging brother duo, underwent a body transformation last year which saw him lean down and get ripped in 100 days. Since then he has been able to maintain the results he achieved through diet and working out, and is now seeking ""incremental"" ways to continue to improve on his personal fitness. In a new video, he documents his experience of doing additional pushups, pullups and ab work every day for a period of 60 days to see what effect it has on his strength and body composition. On top of his regular training, Jones begins doing an extra 15-minute workout each morning comprising 3 sets of 15 pushups, 3 sets of 45-second core-activating planks, and 3 sets of 8 pullups. He also does left-handed band pulls to build some strength in that arm which will help add balance to his upper-body exercises. ""The one thing that's been kind of tough is motivating myself to get to the second workout in the evening, which is always the hardest workout of the day,"" he says. However, as he remains consistent in his training, Jones soon begins to see results, most notably in his increased upper-body strength: five weeks into the challenge, his ability to do ring muscleups has improved. ""I am just over halfway through and I already feel so much stronger, it is shocking,"" he says. ""When I started I was on 15 pushups, now I have moved that up to 4 sets of 20 and can do that comfortably. Pullups have progressed from 2 sets of 8 to 4 sets of 10... I've also realized I can use this high frequency training to focus on things like improving with my rings pullups, working on explosive pullups."" At the end of the 60 days, Jones has lost 4.5 pounds and his body fat has dropped from 18.2 to 14.8 percent. ""I feel like I'm really lean... This really paid off,"" he says.

4/5/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, long an advocate of Western rapprochement with Russia, expressed regret for his earlier stance, saying his years of support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline had been a clear mistake. Steinmeier, a Social Democrat who served as Foreign Minister under Chancellor Angela Merkel before being elevated to the presidency, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine meant he and others had to reckon honestly with what they had got wrong. ""My adherence to Nord Stream 2 was clearly a mistake,"" he said. ""We were sticking to a bridge in which Russia no longer believed and which other partners had warned us against."" Steinmeier was a prominent member of a wing of his Social Democratic Party, led by former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, that argued close economic ties to Russia were a way of anchoring it within a western-oriented global system. The now-cancelled Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which critics said would have weakened Ukraine by cutting it out of the energy transit business, was a centrepiece of that strategy. That has triggered a growing backlash, with critics on social media repeatedly tweeting past pictures of him affectionately embracing Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, while Ukraine's ambassador Andrij Melnyk has been outspoken in his criticism. When Steinmeier arranged a ""solidarity concert"" for Ukraine, Melnyk tweeted sarcastically that the only soloists appeared to be Russian. ""An affront,"" he wrote. ""Sorry, I'm not coming."" Germany's president is meant to be a unifying figure who stands above the cut and thrust of daily politics, one who enjoys the moral authority to exhort people to better behaviour. ""We failed to build a common European house,"" Steinmeier said. ""I did not believe Vladimir Putin would embrace his country's complete economic, political and moral ruin for the sake of his imperial madness,"" he added. ""In this, I, like others, was mistaken.""

4/5/2022,"Controversial Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) took to the House floor on Monday to educate troll his fellow representatives on the definition of a woman. “I never imagined that one of my sacred duties in this hallowed chamber would be explaining to the House Speaker the difference between a man and a woman,” he said, referencing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “Take notes, Madame Speaker, I’m about to define what a woman is for you.” Cawthorn then offered this tasteless definition: “XX chromosomes, no tallywacker.” “It’s so simple,” Cawthorn said. “And yet, today, this proclamation of fundamental scientific fact will cause the woke liberals in Silicon Valley to strip you of your voice and ban you until you bow at their altar of falsehoods.” Cawthorn’s comment seemed to be in response to an interaction that took place during Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Senate confirmation hearings, during which she was asked to define the word “woman” by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Jackson declined to offer a definition and responded, “I’m not a biologist.” Although many conservatives made hay with the remark, USA Today noted that many scientists, gender law scholars and philosophers of biology say there is no sufficient way to clearly define what makes someone a woman. Gender has become a hot-button talking point on the right amid a wave of anti-transgender bills proposed in state legislatures around the country. Among them is Texas’ law that would classify gender-affirming care for transgender kids as child abuse and is currently facing legal challenges. Meanwhile, Twitter users weren’t impressed by Cawthorn’s comments. Cawthorn has been on somewhat of a roll recently, after angering his fellow Republicans by claiming various top “leaders” had invited him to orgies and had also used cocaine in front of him. He also came under fire for calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug” and for driving with a revoked license. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

4/5/2022,"BUCHA, Ukraine (AP) — Moscow faced global revulsion and accusations of war crimes Monday after the Russian pullout from the outskirts of Kyiv revealed streets, buildings and yards strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians, many of them evidently killed at close range. The grisly images of battered or burned bodies left out in the open or hastily buried led to calls for tougher sanctions against the Kremlin, especially a cutoff of fuel imports from Russia. Germany and France reacted by expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, suggesting they were spies, and U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian leader Vladimir Putin should be tried for war crimes. “This guy is brutal, and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous,” Biden said, referring to the town northwest of the capital that was the scene of some of the horrors. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy left the capital, Kyiv, for his first reported trip since the war began nearly six weeks ago to see for himself what he called the “genocide” and “war crimes” in Bucha. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy pledged that Ukraine would work with the European Union and the International Criminal Court to identify Russian fighters involved in any atrocities. “The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who among their fellow citizens killed, who gave orders, who turned a blind eye to the murders,” he said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the scenes outside Kyiv as a “stage-managed anti-Russian provocation.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the images contained “signs of video forgery and various fakes.” Russia has similarly rejected previous allegations of atrocities as fabrications on Ukraine’s part. Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces in recent days. The Ukrainian prosecutor-general’s office described one room discovered in Bucha as a “torture chamber.” In a statement, it said the bodies of five men with their hands bound were found in the basement of a children’s sanatorium where civilians were tortured and killed. Associated Press journalists saw dozens of bodies in Bucha, including at least 13 in and around a building that local people said Russian troops used as a base. Three other bodies were found in a stairwell, and a group of six were burned together. Many victims seen by AP appeared to have been shot at close range. Some were shot in the head. At least two had their hands tied. A bag of spilled groceries lay near one victim. The dead witnessed by the news agency's journalists also included bodies wrapped in black plastic, piled on one end of a mass grave in a Bucha churchyard. Many of those victims had been shot in cars or killed in explosions trying to flee the city. With the morgue full and the cemetery impossible to reach, the churchyard was the only place to keep the dead, Father Andrii Galavin said. Tanya Nedashkivs’ka said she buried her husband in a garden outside their apartment building after he was detained by Russian troops. His body was one of those left heaped in a stairwell. “Please, I am begging you, do something!” she said. “It’s me talking, a Ukrainian woman, a Ukrainian woman, a mother of two kids and one grandchild. For all the wives and mothers, make peace on Earth so no one ever grieves again."" Another Bucha resident, Volodymyr Pilhutskyi, said his neighbor Pavlo Vlasenko was taken away by Russian soldiers because the military-style pants he was wearing and the uniforms that Vlasenko said belonged to his security guard son appeared suspicious. When Vlasenko’s body was later found, it had burn marks from a flamethrower, his neighbor said. “I came closer and saw that his body was burnt,” Pilhutskyi said. “They didn’t just shoot him.” Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, insisted Monday at a news conference that during the time that Bucha was under Russian control, “not a single local person has suffered from any violent action.” However, high-resolution satellite imagery by commercial provider Maxar Technologies showed that many of the bodies have been lying in the open for weeks, during the time that Russian forces were in Bucha. The New York Times first reported on the satellite images showing the dead. In other developments, more than 1,500 civilians were evacuated Monday from the besieged and devastated port city of Mariupol in the south, using the dwindling number of private vehicles available to get out, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. But amid the fighting, a Red Cross-accompanied convoy of buses that has been thwarted for days on end in a bid to deliver supplies and evacuate residents was again unable to get inside the city, Vereshchuk said. European leaders and the United Nations human rights chief joined the Ukrainians in condemning the bloodshed that was exposed after Russian troops withdrew from the area around Kyiv. At the same time, many warned that the full extent of the horrors has yet to emerge. “I can tell you without exaggeration but with great sorrow that the situation in Mariupol is much worse compared to what we’ve seen in Bucha and other cities, towns, and villages nearby Kyiv,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. Zelenskyy was due to speak to a previously scheduled U.N. Security Counsel meeting Tuesday. Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, said the session was certain to focus on the killing of large numbers of civilians in Ukraine. Western and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of war crimes before, and the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor has already opened an investigation. But the latest reports ratcheted up the condemnation. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the images from Bucha reveal the “unbelievable brutality of the Russian leadership and those who follow its propaganda.” And French President Emmanuel Macron said there is “clear evidence of war crimes” in Bucha that demand new punitive measures. “I’m in favor of a new round of sanctions and in particular on coal and gasoline. We need to act,” he said on France-Inter radio. Though united in outrage, the European allies appeared split on how to respond. While Poland urged Europe to quickly wean itself off Russian energy, Germany said it would stick with a gradual approach of phasing out coal and oil imports over the next several months. The U.S. and its allies have sought to punish Russia for the invasion by imposing sweeping sanctions but fear further harm to the global economy, which is still recovering from the pandemic. Europe is in a particular bind, since it gets 40% of its gas and 25% of its oil from Russia. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described Russia under Putin as a “totalitarian-fascist state” and called for strong actions “that will finally break Putin’s war machine.” “Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?” Morawiecki asked of Macron. Russia withdrew many of its forces from the capital area in recent days after being thwarted in its bid to swiftly capture Kyiv. It has instead poured troops and mercenaries into the country's east in a stepped-up bid to gain control of the Donbas, the largely Russian-speaking industrial region that includes Mariupol, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting and worst suffering of the war. About two-thirds of the Russian troops around Kyiv have left and are either in Belarus or on their way there, probably getting more supplies and reinforcements, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment. Russian forces also appear to be repositioning artillery and troops to try to take the city of Izyum, which lies on a key route to the Donbas, the official said. On Monday, Russian shelling killed 11 people in the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said in a video message on social media. Kim said nine of the victims died at a public transport stop in the city center. Zelenskyy appealed for more weaponry as Russia prepares a new offensive. “If we had already got what we needed — all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons — we could have saved thousands of people,” he said. ___ Qena reported from Motyzhyn, Ukraine.

Klain said that ""nothing"" in Jackson's record ""supports this assertion."" The White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, on Monday called out Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's comments about Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee. In response to a clip of Cruz claiming that Jackson would be ""the furthest-left justice"" in the Supreme Court's 233-year history, Klain tweeted, ""Nothing in Judge Jackson's record, experience, or temperament supports this assertion."" Cruz, who's said he opposes Jackson's confirmation and grilled her during her confirmation hearings, made the statement as the Senate Judiciary Committee met to consider Jackson's nomination on Monday. ""There have been 115 men and women who have served on the Supreme Court. If Judge Jackson is confirmed, I believe she will prove to be the most extreme and the furthest-left justice ever to serve on the United States Supreme Court,"" Cruz said during the panel's hearing. Since Biden announced Jackson as his nominee in late February, the White House has forcefully dismissed GOP criticisms of her and her record. Cruz and several other Republican senators have alleged that Jackson is ""soft on crime"" because of her sentencing record on child-pornography cases while she served as a federal district judge. Republicans have seized on a handful of cases in which Jackson imposed shorter sentences than those recommended by the federal guidelines to claim that she's lenient toward offenders. Legal experts, however, have widely described the accusations as baseless, saying they lack key context and data that shows Jackson's record mirrors that of most federal judges, and described the sentencing guidelines as outdated and overly severe. During the confirmation hearings, Cruz pressed Jackson for her views on culture-war issues including critical race theory. Jackson repeatedly emphasized that critical race theory plays no part in her jurisprudence. A spokesperson for Cruz slammed Klain, telling Insider in a statement on Monday that the White House chief of staff ""is firing out tweets to distract from the fact that he is overseeing an administration that is flailing both domestically and internationally."" ""Judge Jackson has a disturbing record of being soft-on-crime, including handing down lenient sentences in child pornography cases below national averages,"" the spokesperson said. ""Judge Jackson has also embraced Critical Race Theory in formulating sentencing policy and refused to define what a 'woman' was during her confirmation hearing."" Jackson defended her record at her confirmation hearings, saying she decides cases from a ""neutral posture"" and ""without fear or favor."" She's received endorsements from top law-enforcement officials and organizations, which have rebuked the GOP accusations against her. Legal figures on the left and the right, including both Democratic- and Republican-appointed judges, have also supported Jackson's nomination. J. Michael Luttig, a retired federal judge and high-profile conservative legal figure who has endorsed Jackson's nomination, also criticized Cruz's claims. ""I would not hesitate to retract my endorsement of Judge Jackson for the Supreme Court if there were anything at all to Senator Cruz's statement, but there is not,"" Luttig tweeted on Monday. ""In fact, quite the opposite is the case."" Cruz is widely considered a potential 2024 White House contender, should Donald Trump not run. His criticism of Jackson during the confirmation hearings was seen in part as an appeal to likely voters in the next presidential race, Insider's Warren Rojas reported. The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to vote on Jackson's nomination on Monday; the panel is expected to be tied 11-11. That would force Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to invoke special procedures to push Jackson's nomination forward. Her final confirmation vote before the full Senate is likely to take place later this week.

4/5/2022,"(Reuters) - The head of the Russian Orthodox Church held a service for Russian soldiers on Sunday in which he called on them to defend their country ""as only Russians can"" as Moscow continues its military campaign in Ukraine. At the lavishly decorated Main Cathedral of the Armed Forces opened two years ago in Kubinka outside Moscow, Patriarch Kirill told a group of servicemen and servicewomen that Russia was a ""peace-loving"" country that had suffered greatly from war. ""We absolutely do not strive for war or to do anything that could harm others,"" said the patriarch, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. ""But we have been raised throughout our history to love our fatherland. And we will be ready to protect it, as only Russians can defend their country."" Kirill, 75, has previously made statements defending Moscow's actions in Ukraine and sees the war as a bulwark against a Western liberal culture that he considers decadent, particularly over the acceptance of homosexuality. His support for the military intervention, in which thousands of soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed, has angered some within the Orthodox church at home as well as in churches abroad linked to the Moscow Patriarchate. At his sermon on Sunday, Patriarch Kirill said he also felt concern for the people affected by the armed conflict. ""All these are people of Holy Russia,"" he said. ""They are our brothers and sisters."" Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its neighbour's military and root out what it called dangerous nationalists. It depicts Ukraine as a potential bridgehead for the Western NATO alliance and a direct threat to Russia. Ukraine and the Western countries supporting it reject that as a baseless pretext for a war of aggression. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions in an effort to force Russia to withdraw its forces.

The late Maryland rapper Goonew quite literally received the Weekend at Bernie’s treatment this past Sunday. Goonew, 24, was shot in a parking lot in Prince George’s County, Maryland on March 18th, and died several hours later at an area hospital. His family believes he was the victim of an armed robbery, and the Prince George’s County Police Department is offering a $25,000 for any information leading to the assailant’s arrest. On Sunday, Goonew’s family and friends held a celebratory event at Washington, D.C.’s Bliss Nightclub, which was billed as the rapper’s “final show.” As Complex points out, Goonew’s apparent embalmed corpse was propped upright and on full display during the event, adorned with a crown and designer clothing. A rapper named Black Fortune, who attended the event, confirmed that it was Goonew’s actual body and “no wax figure.” He added, “As long as his mother was happy that’s all that matter.” In a statement issued on Monday, Bliss Nightclub said it was “never made aware” that Goonew’s corpse would be on display during the event. “Bliss was contacted by a local funeral home to rent out our venue for Goonew’s home-going celebration,” the statement notes. “We sincerely apologize to all those who may be upset or offended.

4/5/2022,"This story contains graphic descriptions and images. While most of the world gasped at the latest round of atrocities perpetrated by invading Russian troops in Ukraine, Kremlin propagandists and government officials are only doubling down. The shocking footage of the massacre that took place in the Ukrainian city of Bucha was repeatedly broadcast on Russian state television this week with the label “Fake” slapped across the screen. During Monday’s broadcast of state TV show 60 Minutes, host Olga Skabeeva speculated that the town was chosen for an elaborate fabrication because of its name. “Biden said that Putin is a butcher. Bucha sounds like “butcher.” How could they not take advantage of such a town?” She later added: “President Putin described them all as “the Empire of lies,” and here is our confirmation.” The so-called “lies” Skabeeva is referring to are the scenes of indescribable horror that were discovered by Ukrainian troops who arrived in Bucha this weekend after the Russian Army withdrew from the city. Scores of bodies, including those of women and children, were littered on roads and in yards, many of them found with their hands bound behind their backs and signs of rape or torture. Dead bodies of five men are pictured, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the town of Bucha, outside Kyiv, Ukraine, April 4, 2022. Russian state media churned out ridiculous assertions, claiming in part that the corpses of women and children depicted in the footage from Bucha—some of which were charred beyond recognition—were “moving their arms,” “getting their limbs out of the way to avoid the wheels of military vehicles” or even “getting up and walking away.” While scenes from Bucha made headlines around the world, Interfax published a report on a ceremony conducted by the Russian military on April 2, in which several awards were presented to the Airborne Forces (VDV) of the Russian Federation in the Kyiv region. According to state TV outlet Zvezda, that unit had been involved in “holding back the actions of the enemy forces” and “performing the cleaning of settlements” in Bucha. “In the Kyiv region, in the area where the tasks of the formation of the Airborne Forces were performed, the awarding of Russian paratroopers took place.The commander of the formation presented state awards to servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat missions during this special military operation,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement about the awards. Horrific New Details of Carnage in Ukraine Town Emerge The same day, the media outlet Ria Fan published the names of seven Russian soldiers to its listing of “Z Heroes.” The state TV program Vesti Nedeli, hosted by Dmitry Kiselyov, showcased the medals awarded to the invading troops: ""For Courage"", “Suvorov” and “Zhukov.” Immediately, participants of the state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Soloviev jumped to heap praise upon the Russian troops and called for various rewards and bonuses, from debt forgiveness to pay raises. Instead of shaming the killers of Ukrainian civilians, Mikheyev loudly asserted: “We need to support them!” He added: “We need to raise their salaries, because they’re risking their lives! Their consumer debts should be written off... During war, we need to support the Russian warrior.” Despite overwhelming evidence of the massacre, the Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that “not a single local in Bucha” suffered any harm while the town was under control of the Russian Armed Forces. During his meeting with UN Deputy Secretary General Martin Griffiths on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the extensive evidence of Russia’s war crimes “a staged production, organized on the streets,” which is being used “for anti-Russian purposes.” The same day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted: “From what we have seen, the video materials cannot be trusted in many respects, because our specialists from the Ministry of Defense have identified signs of video fraud and all sorts of fakes.” Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that the videos from Bucha “were fabricated and are a provocation,” claiming that Russian troops left Bucha on March 30. Despite Russia’s denials, satellite images obtained by The New York Times confirmed that bodies of massacred civilians lay in the streets of Bucha for weeks, while the town was in full control of the Russian troops. Meanwhile, on his Sunday show, host Vladimir Soloviev angrily yelled that the goal of the West is a total destruction of Russia. He demanded: “Don’t get in the way of our Army’s work, on all levels! Free their hands!” Political scientist Sergey Mikheyev then chimed in with his own take on Bucha: “Maybe it’s a production, or maybe they brought the corpses from elsewhere. There is no shortage of dead bodies over there. There are no problems with [getting] corpses.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/5/2022,"By Simon Gardner BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - A man lay sprawled by the roadside in the Ukrainian city of Bucha on Sunday, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation. Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, said 50 of the dead residents, found after Russian forces withdrew from the city late last week, were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops, and the officials have accused Moscow of war crimes. Russia's defence ministry said in a statement issued on Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging 'crimes' by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation,"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing the dead residents. But three bodies seen by Reuters reporters on Sunday -- the corpse with the hands bound and two others which did not have bound hands -- bore bullet shots to the head consistent with what Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk and his deputy described as executions. In all three cases, there were no signs of any other significant injuries elsewhere in the body. All three people shot in the head were male, and all three were dressed in civilian clothing. On the body of the person whose hands were bound, there were powder burn marks on his lips and face. Such marks can mean a person was shot at close range. The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers. Reuters sent questions to the Kremlin and the Russian defence ministry about the corpses that its reporters had witnessed, but received no immediate reply. Russia's defence ministry, in its statement on Sunday said: ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions."" It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30 they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region. Shapravskyi, the deputy mayor, said some 300 people were found dead after the Russian withdrawal. Of these, he said officials so far have logged 50 as executions carried out by Russian forces. Reuters could not independently verify those figures. The others were either killed in crossfire, or their deaths are so far unexplained. ""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk, the mayor, said as he showed Reuters reporters one of the bodies. SHALLOW GRAVE Reuters also spoke to one local resident who described a person being found dead after Russian troops detained them, and another resident who described two people found dead with single gunshot wounds to the head. Reuters was not able to independently verify the descriptions provided by the residents. Sobbing as she gestured at her husband's shallow grave, a shot of vodka topped with a cracker resting on freshly dug earth, Tetyana Volodymyrivna recounted an ordeal at the hands of Russian troops in this city 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv. She and her husband, a former Ukrainian marine, were dragged from their apartment when Russian troops set up their command centre in their building. The soldiers held them prisoner in the apartment building where they lived. She said the Russians, when they arrived in the city, asked people who they were, and demanded to see documents. She said a fighter with the Russian forces who she believed was from Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region warned he would ""cut us up."" She did not say how she knew he was Chechen. Reuters sent a request for comment to the office of the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, a Kremlin loyalist, but received no reply. Tetyana, who identified herself by her first name and patronymic but did not give her family name, was released after being held for four days. Her husband was nowhere to be seen for several days, until she was told about some bodies in a basement stairwell of the building where she and her husband lived. ""I recognised him by his sneakers, his trousers. He looked mutilated, his body was cold,"" she said. ""My neighbor still has a picture of his face. He had been shot in the head, mutilated, tortured."" Reuters reviewed the photograph, which showed that the face and body were badly mutilated. The news agency could not determine if there was a bullet wound. After recovering her husband's body, she and some neighbours buried it in a garden plot near their building, just deep enough ""so dogs wouldn't eat him,"" she said. Another corpse still lay in the stairwell where her husband was found, a Reuters reporter saw. Local residents covered the body with a bedsheet as a mark of dignity. ""SHOT IN LEFT EYE"" Around the corner, another grave contained the remains of two men, a woman resident told Reuters. She said the men had been taken away by Russian troops. She did not witness them being killed. When the bodies were found, both had been shot through the left eye, she said. Six other residents gathered near the grave said her account was correct. One of the residents said she recognised one of the dead men as a tenant in the apartment complex, who she said was a retired member of the Ukrainian military. Bucha was captured in the days immediately after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces who swept south, capturing the defunct nuclear reactor at Chernobyl and moving southwards toward the capital. Bucha and the northern outskirts of nearby Irpin were the point at which the Russian advance from the northwest was halted after they met with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle for the capital, until Russian forces pulled back from north of Kyiv. Moscow said in late March it was regrouping to focus on battles in eastern Ukraine. On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion. On Sunday, roads in Bucha were littered with unexploded ordnance. Rockets poked out of the tarmac near burned-out wrecks of tanks. Some residents scrawled ""Beware, mines"" on their walls in chalk after finding booby traps or missiles on their premises. Resident Volodomir Kopachov said Russians troops had set up a rocket system in a vacant lot next to his garden. When a Reuters reporter visited, boxes of ammunition and spent shell casings littered the ground. Kopachov, a Ukrainian dog breeder, was in mourning. He said his 33-year-old daughter, her boyfriend and a friend were shot dead by Russian troops after firing a party streamer towards them just days before the pullback. Kopachov's wife said they fired the streamer as a gesture of defiance, not with the intent of harming the soldiers. ""It is so hard to go through it all,"" said the 69-year-old,"" as 10 Alabai, a breed of prized Central Asian Shepherd dog, barked in his backyard. Kopachov said he had not ventured beyond the gates of his house for a month. ""They were killing [people] on the spot. No one asked: 'who you are, why you are out?'. The men were simply shot."" The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas. Speaking in Hostomel, near Bucha, on Sunday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said: ""This is not a special operation, these are not police actions... These are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians.""

4/5/2022,"A satellite image analysis conducted by The New York Times appears to disprove Moscow's claims that the massacre in Bucha, Ukraine happened after Russian soldiers had left the town around March 30. Since gruesome images out of Bucha emerged over the weekend, the Russian Ministry of Defense has denied responsibility for any of the killings and decried the reports as a ""hoax."" On Sunday, the ministry even suggested the bodies were placed on the street after Russian troops withdrew, the Times writes. However, a Times' review of video and satellite images shows ""many of the civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russia's military was in control of the town."" For example, when cross-referenced with a video filmed April 2, satellite images provided to the Times showed that at least 11 bodies seen in the April 2 video had been on the street since March 11, ""when Russia, by its own account, occupied the town,"" the Times writes. More specifically, the images show human body-sized objects on Yablonska Street in Bucha between March 9 and March 11. The objects ""appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 2 shows,"" the Times adds. Further examination reveals the objects were in those positions for more than three weeks. The situation out of Bucha has so far sparked international condemnation and promises of more sanctions on Russia.

4/5/2022,"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea opposes war, but if South Korea chooses military confrontation or makes a preemptive strike, then the North's nuclear forces will have to attack, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un said on Tuesday. Kim Yo Jong, a senior official in the government and ruling party, said it was a ""very big mistake"" for South Korea's minister of defence to make recent remarks discussing attacks on the North, state news agency KCNA reported. South Korean Defence Minister Suh Wook said on Friday that his country's military has a variety of missiles with significantly improved firing range, accuracy and power, with ""the ability to accurately and quickly hit any target in North Korea."" North Korea has test-fired a range of increasingly powerful missiles this year, and officials in Seoul and Washington fear it may be preparing to resume testing nuclear weapons for the first time since 2017 amid stalled negotiations. Kim and another North Korean official issued earlier statements on Sunday condemning those remarks, and warned that Pyongyang would destroy major targets in Seoul if the South takes any ""dangerous military action"" such as a preemptive strike. In her second statement, on Tuesday, Kim said Pyongyang opposes war, which would leave the peninsula in ruins, and does not view South Korea as its principal enemy. ""In other words, it means that unless the south Korean army takes any military action against our state, it will not be regarded as a target of our attack,"" she said. ""But if south Korea, for any reason - whether or not it is blinded by misjudgment - opts for such military action as 'preemptive strike' touted by (Suh Wook), the situation will change,"" Kim added. ""In that case, south Korea itself will become a target."" If the South Korean military violates even an inch (2.5 cm) of North Korea territory, it will face an ""unimaginably terrible disaster"" and the North's nuclear combat force will have to inevitably carry out its duty, she said. ""This is not just a threat. This is a detailed explanation of our reaction to possible reckless military action by south Korea,"" Kim said, noting that the South can avoid this fate by dropping any ""fantastic daydream"" of launching a preemptive attack on a nuclear-armed state.

4/5/2022,"Beating the Monday blues will be especially trying for Google employees this week. Starting today, workers are required to come into company headquarters three times a week. But according to Laszlo Bock, former chief of Google human resources and current CEO of Humu, this hybrid model won’t be around much longer. Bock says that after three to five years of flexible work models and hybrid plans, the normal in-office schedule will prevail at Google—and beyond. He predicts this transition will happen over the next few years, telling Bloomberg it’s the “boil the frog method.” “The purpose of the ‘boil the frog method’ [is] to do it subtly and thereby avoid difficult questions and conflict,” Bock told Fortune. “But that’s not only bad for trust and morale, it’s also not the best thing for employees or for the company.” Bock said his research at Humu shows that the perfect mix of employee productivity and worker happiness is a 3+2 schedule, in which three days are spent in the office, and two are remote. This combination, he says, gives individuals the chance to build relationships in-office and work on individual tasks that are easier at home. But Bock says that executives are reluctant to accept permanent work-from-home models. This could be due to the large investment that companies make when buying luxury offices. But it could also have to do with management itself. “Most executives have been working in offices for 20 to 30 years, so it’s comfortable for them. It’s the environment in which they know how to lead,” he told Fortune. “They want to go back to what is familiar, and they believe their experience trumps what Humu’s science shows: A hybrid model is better for productivity and happiness than being in the office five days a week.” When the pandemic hit in 2020, many white-collar jobs shifted to remote work for safety reasons. The tech sector readily adapted to this new format, as many employees learned that they liked the flexibility that working from home afforded them. But a new wave of companies, including tech giants like Meta and Apple, are starting to try to coax (or summon) their workers back to their headquarters. While some studies have shown that this shift to virtual work does not lead to a lack of employee productivity, Bock tells Fortune that this research is missing the full story. “It’s true that total workforce productivity hasn’t changed, but workforce productivity per hour worked has dropped. People are working longer hours, taking fewer breaks, and working on weekends because it’s become impossible to turn off work.” He adds that there is an emotional toll to working isolated without any teammates or coworkers present. Bock said he thinks workers will likely begin to want to come into the office themselves when they see bosses giving more promotions and opportunities to staff who are in the building over those who work from home. The new power dynamic will likely force reluctant employees to get back to the office when trying to gain favor with their supervisors. Bosses looking to push their employees back to their headquarters should make sure that there are obvious benefits to coming into work. Whether that be providing in-person coaching opportunities or free lunches, Bock suggests that employers make the perks to working in the office clear. He also urges companies to ensure that their promises hold weight. “Many companies will promise a great in-office experience but will fail to deliver,” Bock said.

4/5/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said it would reiterate its request for the U.N. Security Council to meet on Monday over what Moscow called the ""criminal provocations by Ukrainian soldiers and radicals"" in the town of Bucha near Kyiv. Britain's mission to the United Nations, which holds the presidency of the 15-member council for April, had said the Council would hold a scheduled discussion on Ukraine on Tuesday, and not meet on Monday as requested by Russia. ""Today Russia will again demand that the U.N. Security Council convene in connection with the criminal provocations of Ukrainian servicemen and radicals in this city,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel. Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday they were investigating possible war crimes by Russia after finding hundreds of bodies strewn around towns outside the capital Kyiv following Russian troops' withdrawal from the area. The Russian defence ministry said the images distributed by Ukraine were ""another staged performance by the Kyiv regime"", and Russia's chief investigator on Monday ordered a probe on the basis that Ukraine had spread ""deliberately false information"" about Russian armed forces in Bucha. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

4/5/2022,"A music teacher at West Irvine Intermediate School who wrote a message to students on his classroom board that later became controversial said he resigned Monday. Tyler Clay Morgan confirmed to the Herald-Leader that he wrote a message on his classroom board that said, “You Are Free to Be Yourself With Me. You Matter.” The message included a rainbow flag and rainbow colors. In a Facebook post Monday, Morgan said, “I resigned from Estill County Schools effective immediately on my own recognizance. That’s all I’m saying on this matter publicly as of right now.” In addition to the post, he also shared a photo of the board message as his cover photo. “Please give me time and space to grieve and process. I don’t know what’s in store for me but right now, I know just need time to get my head straight,” Morgan said. Other than confirming that he wrote the message on the classroom board, he said he wanted his Facebook post to be his only public comment for now. School administrators were made aware of the incident on Thursday afternoon and started an investigation, Estill County Superintendent Jeff Saylor told the Herald-Leader. Saylor declined to provide specifics about the investigation or what was inappropriate about the incident. Saylor said the teacher had not been fired or reprimanded over the statement and they were scheduled to meet Monday. “This has nothing to do with the statement on the board,” Saylor said. He said he had no problem with the content of the message on the board. Saylor also said the school district does not discriminate against students or employees on any basis, including race or sexual orientation or any other basis. On Monday after Morgan’s resignation, he told the Herald-Leader that over the past few days there has been a lot of conversations and misinformation surrounding the incident at West Irvine Intermediate School. “A lot of this conversation centered on the statement, ‘You are free to be yourself.’ As superintendent, my issue has not been with this statement because we have to meet the needs of all of our students and families,” Saylor said. “The issue at hand is the conversations that took place during class. I firmly believe that students and their parents expect teachers to teach content about their assigned curriculum in a subject area,“ Saylor said. “Of course, there are times that conversations may vary from that day’s lesson plan, but these conversations went far beyond the music curriculum. It is my job to make sure that parents are not surprised by these types of situations.” Saylor said he believes that all teachers have a responsibility to be supportive of their students, “but when students share difficult situations and circumstances with them, the student should be referred to a certified school counselor.” Saylor said the matter has been addressed and closed. He said he would not be making any further comment “out of respect for everyone involved.” .In response, Morgan said students needs come first. “Many times, those needs are unspoken. I never held a private conversation with a student, I never allowed them to feel like they are not seen, and only wished to provide a safe space to allow all students to be themselves. This included students of different nationalities, race, and of overall socio-economic standing.” “My choice to resign was one of my own, after physical, including even death threats, occurred and I no longer left safe in the environment that is Estill County,” Morgan said. He said his talks with Saylor ended as amicable as possible. “However, I still firmly believe more work needs to be done in Kentucky, especially in Eastern Kentucky, to ensure that more resources are provided to make sure all students feel safe, secure, and seen, not just the ones that come out as part of any community or share hardships,” said Morgan. “My hope is that every educator that sees this is empowered, passionate, and actively working to make a change in the world of education as I am.” Herald-Leader staff writer Bill Estep contributed to this report.",U.S./Lexington Herald-Leader,KY teacher resigns after controversy surrounding message written on classroom board,https://news.yahoo.com/ky-teacher-resigns-controversy-surrounding-225445192.html

""Under optimistic diplomatic statements that Ukraine could become a member of NATO, then, in 2008, refusal to accept Ukraine into the alliance was hidden. The absurd fear of some politicians toward Russia was hidden,"" Zelenskyy said. ""They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us."" He added later: ""I invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women."" During the 2008 summit, NATO leaders discussed requests by Ukraine and Georgia to join the Membership Action Plan, which is required for any country that wants to qualify for NATO membership. While then-US President George W. Bush pressed for both countries to be given the MAP, Germany and France argued that such a step would increase friction with Russia, which had strongly opposed Ukraine's request. In the end, the alliance did not take any immediate action but pledged that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually become NATO members, according to an official summary of the talks. They reiterated this promise at another NATO summit in Brussels in July. Russia has continued opposing NATO's eastward expansion and cited it as a reason for invading Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Last month Zelenskyy said he had accepted that his country could not join NATO at the moment, telling Western officials: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of NATO. We understand that."" Ukraine also offered never to join NATO during peace negotiations with Russia last week.

4/5/2022,"By Justyna Pawlak and Krisztina Than BUDAPEST (Reuters) -Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban scored a fourth consecutive landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his ambition of a conservative, ""illiberal"" state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's close ties with Moscow. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine had appeared to upend Orban's campaign in recent weeks, forcing him into awkward manouvering to explain decade-old cosy business relations with President Vladimir Putin. But he mounted a successful campaign to persuade his Fidesz party's core electorate that the six-party opposition alliance of Peter Marki-Zay promising to mend ties with the European Union could lead the country into war, an accusation the opposition denied. Surrounded by leading party members, a triumphant Orban, 58, said Sunday's victory came against all odds. ""We have scored a victory so big, that it can be seen even from the Moon,"" he said. ""We have defended Hungary's sovereignty and freedom."" Preliminary results with about 98% of national party list votes counted showed Orban's Fidesz party leading with 53.1% of votes versus 35% for Marki-Zay's opposition alliance. Fidesz was also winning 88 of 106 single-member constituencies. Based on preliminary results, the National Election Office said Fidesz would have 135 seats, a two-thirds majority, and the opposition alliance would have 56 seats. A far-right party called Our Homeland would also make it into parliament, winning 7 seats. His comfortable victory could embolden Orban, 58, in his policy agenda which critics say amounts to a subversion of democratic norms, media freedom and the rights of minorities, particularly gay and lesbian people. Conceding defeat, Marki-Zay, 49, said Fidesz's win was due to what he called its vast propaganda machine, including media dominance. ""I don't want to hide my disappointment, my sadness ... We knew this would be an uneven playing field,"" he said. ""We admit that Fidesz got a huge majority of the votes. But we still dispute whether this election was democratic and free."" The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sent a full-scale election monitoring mission for the vote, only the second such effort in an European Union member state. ONE-PARTY RULE One of Europe's longest-serving leaders, Orban has emerged as a vocal supporter of anti-immigration policies and an opponent of tough energy sanctions against Moscow. Critics say he has sought to cement one-party rule by overhauling the constitution, taking control of a majority of media outlets and rejigging election rules, as well as staffing key government posts with loyalists and rewarding businessmen close to Fidesz with lucrative state contracts. Still, he wins favour with many older, poorer voters in rural areas who espouse his traditional Christian values and with families who benefit from a host of tax breaks and price caps on fuel and some foodstuffs. The election comes at a time when global energy woes and steep labour shortages in the region have fuelled inflation increases throughout central Europe. Consumer price growth reached an almost 15-year high of 8.3% in February in Hungary. Critics say the public perception of the war has been influenced by state-controlled media which have amplified Orban's accusations that an opposition-led government would support sanctions on Russian gas shipments and put Hungary at risk by shipping weapons to Ukraine. With voting under way throughout Hungary, Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, while Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies there with calls for new sanctions against Moscow. Orban has condemned the Russian invasion, which the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"" and has not vetoed any European Union sanctions against Moscow even though he said he did not agree with them. But he has banned any transport of arms to Ukraine via Hungarian territory, facing criticism from his nationalist allies in Poland, and said benefits of close ties with Russia include gas supply security. His victory, however, is a relief for Warsaw's nationalist Law and Justice government which has relied on his backing in Brussels to counter penalties over rule of law breaches.
