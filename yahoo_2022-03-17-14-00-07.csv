3/17/2022,"It sure seems like we've seen the Russo-Ukrainian war before — the story of a seemingly superior Great Power military invading an apparently weaker underdog nation, only to find itself stymied by the irregular tactics and fierce nationalism of the defenders. ""The Russians were not ready for unconventional warfare,"" Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told The Washington Post, adding, ""They are not sure how to deal with this insurgency, guerilla-warfare-type situation."" If that's the case, Russian leaders have short memories. They should remember the Soviet Union's doomed war against Afghanistan, which ended in 1989 after a decade of brutal fighting against insurgents. For that matter, weren't they watching just a few months ago when the United States exited Afghanistan, undone by the exact same dynamic? Is nobody paying attention? There is some speculation that Russian President Vladimir Putin took precisely the wrong lesson from those defeats. ""I reckon he thought he'd roll into Kyiv the way the Taliban rolled into Kabul,"" Zoya Sheftalovich, a contributing editor for Politico's Europe edition, wrote in February. ""Thought ordinary Ukrainians wouldn't resist. No bloodshed. Clean."" Or perhaps Putin became overconfident because of his own country's bloody devastation of opposition forces in Syria. If either of those theories reflects Putin's mindset, though, it's clear he misread both events. Russia's leader might have thought that he, like the Taliban, was reclaiming a piece of his own country by invading Ukraine — but it's now clear Ukrainians think otherwise. And while the Russians were dominant in Syria, they had the benefit of being allied with the regime pre-dating their involvement. The Ukrainians, meanwhile, are mostly united against the invaders. But it also seems to be the case that Great Power militaries build their forces for great army-on-army battles; guerilla warfare doesn't play to either their strengths or preferences. ""On one hand, the great power intrinsically brings overwhelmingly superior resources and technology to this type of conflict,"" then-Major Robert M. Cassidy wrote in a 2002 journal article, Why Great Powers Fight Small Wars Badly. ""On the other hand, the seemingly inferior opponent generally exhibits superior will, demonstrated by a willingness to accept higher costs and to persevere against many odds."" That's a lesson grounded in history — going back, as Cassidy noted, all the way to the Roman Empire. It's also rooted in lived experience: In modern times, the United States ignored the experience of the French in Vietnam, only to get a crash course in counterinsurgency fighting, then promptly forgot everything and have to learn it all over again in Iraq and Afghanistan. All of this means the Russian war is — like most wars — a failure of historical memory. More embarrassing to Putin and his cronies: It's recent history. And if that history is any guide, we'll also soon forget its lessons again. GOP senator says a war between NATO and Russia 'would end pretty quickly' Taraji P.

3/17/2022,"By Catarina Demony, Francesco Guarascio and Ali Kucukgocmen ISTANBUL/MADRID/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich jetted into Moscow on Tuesday as the Spanish government seized more assets belonging to Russia's rich and the EU banned exports of caviar and luxury goods. Abramovich landed in Moscow early on Tuesday after taking off from Istanbul in his private jet, according to FLIGHTRADAR24 data. A source familiar with the matter said he was not in Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin. It was the second trip a jet linked to the oligarch has made between the Turkish city of Istanbul and the Russian capital in the past three days, the FLIGHTRADAR24 data showed. On Monday, he was spotted in the VIP lounge at Tel Aviv airport before the jet took off for Istanbul. Abramovich was among several Russian billionaires added on Tuesday to an EU blacklist that already includes dozens of wealthy Russians. World governments are seeking to isolate Putin and his allies over the invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special operation."" The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank, exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks, and the asset freeze of oligarchs and top politicians, including Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export to Russia any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros ($330), including precious stones, crystal, caviar, wine, handbags, leather products, shoes and coats. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned. This is intended to impact on the lifestyle of Russia's elites, an EU official said. Britain also imposed fresh sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities on Tuesday, using a new law to catch up with the EU and United States in targeting people accused of propping up Putin. Britain said the latest round of sanctions included elites with a net worth of 100 billion pounds ($130 billion). ""We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin - from major oligarchs, to his prime minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation.

Abramovich said last week he was selling Chelsea soccer club, but after being targeted by British sanctions that sale is now on hold. Chelsea is operating under a special government license and the Premier League board has disqualified him as a club director. Germany's Bild newspaper reported that Abramovich had met with former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Moscow on Thursday evening before Schroeder sat down with Putin. A source familiar with the matter confirmed the meeting with Schroeder to Reuters and said that the oligarch wanted to find a way to stop the war. A spokesperson for Abramovich declined to comment. The Russian billionaire, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, has said he does not have close ties to Putin. Portugal has opened an investigation into how Abramovich was granted citizenship.

Its destination had previously been shown as Turkey. It was unclear how the fresh EU sanctions would impact the yacht's progress through European waters.

On Monday, Spanish authorities said they had seized the 85-meter (279-foot) superyacht Valerie, valued at $140 million, in Barcelona.

3/17/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's military said on Thursday that it had spotted four large Russian amphibious warfare ships sailing close to its islands as they traveled west, possibly towards Europe. Pictures of the amphibious transports, typically used for landing expeditionary forces ashore, published by Japan's defence ministry showed what appeared to be military trucks loaded onto the deck of one of the vessels. We don't know where they are heading, but their heading suggest it is possible,"" a Japanese defence ministry spokesman said. Asked if they could be bound for Ukraine, he said ""it is possible"". A Japanese Self Defense Force maritime patrol first detected the Russian vessels, which can carry dozens of tanks other military vehicles and hundreds of troops, on Tuesday and monitored them as they passed West from the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan through the narrow Tsuruga Strait separating Japan's main Honshu island from Hokkaido island on Wednesday. It is unusual for Russian ships to pass through the strait so close to Japanese territory, the military spokesman said. Armed with anti-tank weapons supplied by the United States and other countries Ukrainian fighters have taken a heavy toll on Russian armour and fuel trucks, meaning Moscow, which describes its attack as a ""special operation,"" may need to reinforce its forces with new equipment. NATO allies, which have already supplied 20,000 anti-tank and other weapons to Ukraine, on Wednesday said they would keep helping the country resist the Russian attack.
