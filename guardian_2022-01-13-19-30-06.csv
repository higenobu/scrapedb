1/13/2022,"A London-based online payments company has become Britain’s most valuable private fintech business after its latest fundraising valued it at $40bn (£29bn), handing its surf-loving founder a paper fortune of around $20bn. Checkout.com, which simplifies payment processes for businesses, achieved the valuation following a $1bn investment that puts the stake of its 40-year-old chief executive, Guillaume Pousaz, at around $20bn. Pousaz, a Swiss national, dropped out of university in 2005 when his father became ill with cancer and he then moved to California to pursue his love of surfing. It was only after running out of cash that he took up a job with International Payment Consultants, a payments processing firm, in 2006.  “I didn’t choose payments — payments chose me,” Pousaz told the Sunday Times in 2020. “I only took that job so I could go surfing.” A year after joining IPC, Pousaz left to launch his first startup. He founded Checkout.com in 2012. Fintech, a catch-all term for financial services firms operating in the digital sphere, has become a key driver of the UK’s success as a tech investment hub, featuring companies such as Revolut and Wise. Venture capitalists, who invest in new companies by taking stakes in them, invested a record £29.4bn in the UK tech sector last year. The number of unicorns – startup firms worth more than $1bn (£750m) – reached a high of 29 in 2021 including Depop, the British secondhand fashion resale app sold to US online marketplace Etsy for $1.6bn this year, and the car-selling platform Motorway. Checkout.com, which is now worth more than British fintech peer Revolut, valued at $33bn, said it would use the funding to launch products and further its involvement in the Web3 space. Web3 is the term used for the next chapter in digital innovation (after Web 2.0 was coined for social media companies) and centres on technological breakthroughs such as blockchain; a digital, decentralised ledger that underpins the cryptocurrency market. Investors in the latest Checkout.com funding round include US investment firms and the Qatar Investment Authority, the Arab state’s sovereign wealth fund. Checkout.com processes payments for clients including Netflix, cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase and Pizza Hut. The fundraising comes a year after the London-based company’s previous round of investment, in which it raised $450m and achieved a valuation of $15bn. Change in how consumers use financial services and a pandemic-driven rise in use of digital services has drawn investor interest in fintechs, prompting global investors to ramp up bets on the sector.",News/Business,Checkout.com becomes UK’s most valuable fintech at $40bn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/13/checkoutcom-becomes-uks-most-valuable-fintech-at-40bn
1/13/2022,"A new report has revealed that a record number of Americans are now alarmed about the climate crisis. The study, published by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, found that Americans overall are becoming increasingly worried about global heating, more engaged with the issue and more supportive of finding solutions to the issue.  The study categorized Americans into six distinct groups based on their beliefs, attitudes, policy support and behavior about climate change. The six distinct groups are: the Alarmed, who are the most engaged and very worried about global warming; the Concerned, who think global warming is a significant threat but prioritize it less and are less likely to take action; the Cautious, who are aware of climate change but are uncertain about its causes and are not very worried; the Disengaged, who are largely unaware of global warming; the Doubtful, who doubt it is happening or human-caused and the Dismissive, who firmly reject its reality and oppose most climate change policies. The study revealed that the largest group, Alarmed (33%) greatly outnumber the dismissive (9%) by more than three to one. Approximately six in 10 Americans (59%) are either Alarmed or Concerned while only approximately two in 10 (19%) are Doubtful or Dismissive. Over the last five years, the Alarmed group has nearly doubled in size, growing 15 percentage points in total. From just March 2021 to September 2021 alone, the Alarmed segment increased by 9 percentage points. Meanwhile, the Dismissive group shrank from 11% to 9% in the past five years, with only about one in 10 Americans now firmly rejecting the reality of human-caused global warming. When the group first began its surveys in 2008, the Concerned was the largest segment. Two years later, the group decreased slightly while the Cautious grew and became roughly equally as large. On the contrary, the Alarmed was the second smallest group as recently as early 2015. The Cautious, Doubtful and Dismissive groups have all shrunk in recent years. “The growth of the Alarmed segment … is encouraging because progress on climate change requires strong, coordinated, and sustained action, and the Alarmed are the most likely to demand and support these actions by leaders,” the study said.",News/Environment,"Record number of Americans alarmed about climate crisis, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/13/record-number-americans-alarmed-about-climate-crisis
1/13/2022,"Hillsong Church has been told by NSW Health to immediately stop singing and dancing at a youth summer camp being held in Newcastle, after footage of youngparishioners dancing to music sparked widespread anger at the state’s exemption for religious groups. Photos and videos posted on the church’s social media accounts over the last two days from its annual youth summer camp showed crowds of people singing without masks during services and dancing to pop music that was non-devotional. The camp, which is aimed at 15- to 17-year-olds, is due to finish on Saturday.  “Singing and dancing at a major recreational facility is in breach of the public health order,” the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said in a statement on Thursday evening. “While the order does not apply to religious services, it does apply to major recreation facilities and this event is clearly in breach of both the spirit and intent of the order, which is in place to help keep the community safe,” he said. NSW police issued a statement saying it would “liaise with organisers” to “ensure future compliance with the public health orders after NSW Health deemed the location to be a major recreational facility”.When contacted by Guardian Australia for comment earlier on Thursday, a Hillsong spokesperson denied that the event was essentially a music festival. “These events are our annual high school-aged youth camps, and are not similar to a music festival in any way,” the spokesperson said. “Outdoor Christian services are held during the camp but these are only a small part of the program,” he added, “and any singing is only a small part of each service (a video circulating on social media today reflects a few minutes of this part of the program).” When pressed on how large groups of young people dancing to songs such as Turn Down For What by DJ Snake and Lil Jon constituted a religious service, the Hillsong spokesperson did not respond. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW government announced last week that the public health order would be amended to ban dancing and singing in all indoor and outdoor settings until 27 January. The new restriction saw a spate of cancellations and postponements from several music events, including Grapevine Gathering festival, Tamworth’s Country Music festival and national tours by Belinda Carlisle and Rod Stewart. But churches and places of worship were considered exempt from the restrictions, with a NSW Health spokesperson telling The Australian on Tuesday: “Singing and dancing in hospitality venues and nightclubs is deemed high risk due to increased movement and mingling within and across these venues, the influence of alcohol consumption, and the removal of masks in these settings to consume food and drink. People attending religious services generally remain in fixed positions and masks are mandatory for these indoor gatherings.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Leading Australian musicians and industry professionals voiced their anger at the Hillsong footage on Thursday, complaining that there appeared to be one rule for religious groups, while musicians were banned from performing. The live music industry has borne the brunt of Covid restrictions for two years, due to near constant restrictions on crowd size and public behaviour. Rock band The Jungle Giants, who were due to headline at Grapevine Gathering festival, tweeted: “Thinking about starting a church in NSW so we can play some gigs. Who’s in?” “You can postpone all our festivals and gigs, you can say no dancing in clubs for the next 50 years, and you can make singing and shouting in public illegal except in sermons and the cricket for some reason,” rapper Illy wrote on Instagram. “But no matter how bullshit you make the rules, you will STILL never, ever, get me to join Hillsong.” One music industry professional who wished to remain anonymous told Junkee they were “literally crying with anger” at the footage. Seeing all the artists, promoters, staff and vendors in #NSW suffer after having outdoor events cancelled and then seeing THIS happening right now in NSW for #Hillsong is disgusting, a huge gut punch to the already suffering industry. Absolute double standards. #NswPol #nswcovid pic.twitter.com/fi5pyQZnrr Earlier in the week, a live-streamed Hillsong service from the church’s Hills Convention Centre in Sydney’s Norwest also provoked anger when the masked congregation was shown on their feet while watching the church’s band, Hillsong Worship, perform.",News/Australia news,Hillsong Church camp ordered to stop singing and dancing by NSW Health,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/hillsong-church-camp-ordered-to-stop-singing-and-dancing-by-nsw-health
1/13/2022,"When I was in my late 30s, someone came up to me in the street and started talking to me as if I were Sidney Poitier. To the extent that they called me “Sidney”. I said: “I’m sorry – my name is Don.” And they looked at me and said: “Oh Sidney, when did you change your name?” They simply would not accept I was somebody else. Even if you didn’t model yourself after Poitier, other people would. He was just the go-to reference. I’ve yet to meet a Black actor who hasn’t been compared to him – which is both irritating and enjoyable. And says more about the one making the comparison.  Yet when I was a little boy growing up in Newcastle, I was of course inspired by him. Poitier meant everything because he was the only light at the end of the tunnel. He was there and doing it and visible and Black. No one else was – or, at least, almost no one. And at that age one somehow needed inspiration from an almost untouchable source. Poitier had done it. And he’d done it with dignity and panache and grace. There wasn’t a moment in anything I ever saw him do on film which made me feel ashamed, which was remarkable. I remember watching The Defiant Ones and In the Heat of the Night and Lilies of the Field and I was so proud of him. There was no sense of this being a Black man doing something – it was just a man. He somehow allowed people into him, beyond his colour. I think the other reason he especially connected with me is that we both came from the Caribbean [Poitier from the Bahamas; Warrington from Trinidad]. I could relate to him coming from a sister island and so his course felt like one I might be able to chart too. Other people simply seemed out of reach. I think this heritage was also crucial in his cut through with both white and Black audiences in the US. Being outside the system meant he didn’t have that oppressive history Americans do. There was a kind of breathing space. Maybe it allowed him to be more himself at a time when to be Black and in America and trying to do what he was doing was very, very hard. That awful legacy still weighs heavily. It might be one of the reasons why people such as Steve McQueen and Chiwetel Ejiofor could make – and be celebrated for – 12 Years a Slave: they were not American. Being an outsider always makes a difference, although it’s not always a good thing. It gives you distance but also leaves you slightly isolated. Poitier went out of fashion. For some people he was too white to be Black. They wanted to give Black people a full range and didn’t care for that kind of representation. But he carried on doing exactly what he was always doing and the world came back to him. I think few people know how committed he was to the cause, and how brilliantly he used his insider status in the system to his – and other Black people’s – advantage. I suspect he often used subterfuge to get what he wanted. He made it possible not only for Black actors to act but for Black people to want to do it. He climbed the ladder but he didn’t pull it up after him. He went: “This is it! You can come here too, and if I can help, I will.” Poitier was the one who made it to the top of the hill. It was a hard climb, but he did it, and his achievement maybe offered a glimpse of what might be possible for people like me. We could at least try.",Arts/Film,‘Sidney Poitier was the only light at the end of the tunnel’: Don Warrington on his lifelong hero,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/sidney-poitier-don-warrington-actor-death-in-paradise
1/13/2022,"The Duke of York’s accuser Virginia Giuffre would be unlikely to accept a “purely financial settlement” to end her sexual assault civil lawsuit against the royal, her lawyer has said. David Boies was speaking after a US judge rejected Prince Andrew’s motion to have the civil case against him dismissed, paving the way for a possible civil trial in the autumn.  Legal experts say one way for Andrew, 61, to avoid trial would be to reach an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre, 38, who claims she was trafficked by the financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with powerful people, including Andrew, when she was 17. Andrew has consistently denied her allegations. Boies said: “I think it’s very important to Virginia Giuffre that this matter be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims.” “I don’t think that she has a firm view at this point, nor could she, as to exactly what the resolution should be. But I think what’s going to be important is that this resolution vindicates her and vindicates the claim she’s made,” he told BBC’s Newsnight. Boies said there had been no suggestion of settlement discussions at this point. He said that prior to bringing the case they had “reached out” to Andrew and the prince’s lawyers and suggested mediation, but “there was no interest in that at that time”. “Whether that has changed or not, I think we’ll have to wait and see.” He added: “A purely financial settlement is not anything that I think she’s [Giuffre] interested in.” When asked about the US ruling, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: “We would not comment on what is an ongoing legal matter.” Andrew now faces the prospect of Giuffre giving a detailed account in court of the allegation she was trafficked to have sex with the Queen’s second son when she was 17. The Manhattan federal judge Lewis Kaplan dismissed a motion by the duke’s lawyers on Wednesday to have the civil case thrown out after they argued Giuffre had waived her right to pursue the royal by signing a confidential settlement in 2009 with Epstein, in exchange for $500,000, in which she agreed not to sue any other potential defendants. In his detailed ruling, Kaplan decided there was more than one interpretation of the 2009 deal saying it was ambiguous, and that it was premature to consider the points raised by Andrew to cast doubt on Giuffre’s claims, though his efforts would be permissible at trial. The ruling means the case now moves to the “discovery” phase. As it progresses towards trial, the duke, Giuffre and any other potential witnesses would have to give depositions. Boies said the judge’s ruling was “an important step” in moving towards any trial. “It is, however, just one step and there are many more steps to be taken,” he said. The next would be the taking of evidence, and they were already in the phase of exchanging documents, he said. He said Andrew had made a lot of statements in his 2019 Newsnight interview, “which he will have to try and back up in his deposition”. Andrew’s approach had been “to deny, deny, deny, to blame Virginia, to criticise her, to attack her character, her moral credibility, and we will see how all that plays out when he’s under oath,” Boies said. Asked if the case went to trial Andrew would be likely to appear in person, Boies said he thought the chances of the case going to trial were “good”. “Whether he shows up himself, or simply his lawyers, is something that is in part up to him, and in part up to the court. In a civil case it is not always necessary for the defendant to be present when the trial takes place. It’s typically advisable because it is often hard to defend yourself when you’re absent,” he said. Andrew has three main options – ignoring the lawsuit, which is his right, engaging with the American legal system to defend himself against the allegations, or attempting to reach an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre. If he ignores the civil proceedings, a default judgment would be made in favour of Giuffre.",News/UK news,"Virginia Giuffre unlikely to accept purely financial settlement, says lawyer",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/virginia-giuffre-unlikely-to-accept-settlement-to-end-prince-andrew-lawsuit
1/13/2022,"An Egyptian media tycoon with close ties to the government has been detained pending an investigation into allegations of sexual assault. The Egyptian public prosecution service says it is investigating reports that businessman Mohamed al-Amin sexually abused girls living in an orphanage that he owned and took them on trips to his holiday villa. Amin, best known for establishing the pro-government CBC network in 2011, was arrested on Friday to be held for four days. The court decided to extend Amin’s pre-trial detention for a further 15 days in a hearing on Sunday where he told the court: “I never did anything wrong. I treated those girls like my own children.”  Allegations of sexual abuse at the Safe Hands Home for Girls were first made public in December by the humanitarian organisation Missing Children. Its founder Rami el-Gebali told the Guardian that an official in the Ministry of Social Solidarity told him in mid-October of multiple complaints about the orphanage that the ministry had been slow to pursue. The ministry says that it closed the home on 29 November. Three girls at the orphanage, aged between 13 and 18, reported to Missing Children that Amin had molested them and taken them to his seaside house on Egypt’s north coast. The girls said they had been made to wear revealing clothes and to dance for Amin. One 13-year-old said that he had presented her with a marriage contract, which he pressured her to sign. In an interview with Egyptian talkshow Sada El Balad, the minister of social solidarity, Niveen Qabbag, said she had initially been impressed by the facilities at the Safe Hands Home when she officially opened it in March 2021. She added that it was well known that Amin would frequently stay at the orphanage with his wife, but that the ministry responded quickly to the sexual abuse allegations in shutting down the home. The story has been widely spread on Twitter in Egypt, with many calling the case “Egypt’s Jeffrey Epstein”, drawing parallels with the US financier who was found dead in his cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex offences. Amin came to prominence in July 2011, when he launched the CBC news channel after the Arab spring protests. The network became well known for supporting the official line of the interim government, at a time when many stations used the increased press freedom to take a more critical view after president Hosni Mubarak had stood down. When President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power in 2014, Amin was appointed to the board of trustees for the presidential development fund, Long Live Egypt, to which his company reportedly donated 1.2bn Egytian pounds (£56.2m). After his arrest, member of the House of Representatives Mostafa Bakry defended Amin on Twitter, saying that he was “the first to donate to the Long Live Egypt fund”, and calling him “a man known for his faith and piety”. Amin is not the first establishment figure to be arrested in recent months. In June last year, businessman Hassan Ratib and former MP Alaa Hassanein were charged with financing illegal excavations and the smuggling abroad of ancient Egyptian antiquities. Their trial began on Saturday where the court heard that the two men funded four archaeological digs in different regions.",News/Global development,Egyptian media owner detained after trafficking and sexual assault claims,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/13/egyptian-media-owner-detained-after-trafficking-and-sexual-assault-claims
