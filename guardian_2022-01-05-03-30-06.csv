1/5/2022,"The striking part about Apple’s $3tn valuation is that it does not look obviously wrong. Or, rather, it does not appear out of line with the racy values the US stock market places on technology companies. There is no need, for example, to engage in heroic horizon-gazing projections, as with $1.2tn Tesla, to support the enormous number. One can roughly get to $3tn at Apple via conventional yardsticks such as revenues, profits and cash generation. The company generated revenues of $366bn in its last financial year that ended in September – $1bn a day – and made profits of $94.7bn. So the shares are being rated at slightly more than 30 times last year’s earnings. That’s punchy, but not wildly so given the rate of revenue growth (one third last year) and the fact that all the profits find their way to investors these days, largely through share buy-backs.  Meanwhile, the old scare story about “peak iPhone” has not materialised. Consumers do not seem deterred by increasingly incremental design improvements. The newer worry about regulatory threats also appears less than daunting. Apple is still clinging onto the princely rake-off fees that its app store extracts from developers, and challenges to the regime move at glacial speed. Apple also looks smarter than, say, Facebook in managing the politics. In any case, even if app store fees were slashed, such an outcome would not be game-changing given the frantic pace of growth in other elements of the “services” line – music, TV, cloud storage and so on. Within the tech universe, Apple is diversified. None of which guarantees that, having skipped lightly from a $1tn valuation to $3tn in less than four years, Apple will progress to $4tn just as smoothly. Higher interest rates (one of the big investment uncertainties for 2022) would seriously test the market’s love affair with tech. But $3tn is not currently ridiculous. There’s nothing like a new year to bring forth optimistic investment thoughts about what might happen in the months ahead, and here come the airlines, reacting to a whiff of optimism about Omicron. On a lively first day of trading, BA owner IAG’s shares rose 11%, easyJet was 9% better and Wizz Air, which reported it carried almost three times as many passengers last month than in December 2020, gained 12%. All those stocks are highly leveraged to the Covid newsflow, so, yes, a bounce in share prices is reasonable if travel restrictions could be eased – if not this week, then soon. Versus a month ago, the Omicron picture for travel, holiday and hotel companies definitely looks less dreadful if infections may be about to peak. The timing could also be ideal: it would allow confidence to return in time for Easter, the first critical period for the short-haul market. That, at least, is one script and the one favoured by bullish analysts. It’s perfectly plausible, but the part of the recovery story that investors might worry about is airlines’ pricing power. As far as one can tell, they’re all planning to return capacity to 2019 levels as quickly as possible. That still feels a little dreamy unless prices are about to be slashed to whip up demand. Even on a gentler Covid outlook (which obviously isn’t guaranteed), one suspects the old profit margins will take a while to return.",News/Business,Apple’s $3tn valuation is not as ridiculous as it seems,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/04/apples-3tn-valuation-is-not-as-ridiculous-as-it-seems
1/5/2022,"Everton have taken their January spend to about £29m with the signing of Nathan Patterson from Rangers. With it, they have addressed two key areas for Rafael Benítez and finally delivered the money in his second transfer window. With it, the club will rightly demand their manager finally delivers a return of his own. Patterson, a 20-year-old Scotland international, signed a five-and-a-half-year contract on Tuesday after Rangers accepted a deal worth about £11m. The right back was the subject of two failed Everton bids in the summer having been identified as a prime young target to challenge and ultimately succeed the 33-year-old Séamus Coleman, the selfless captain who continues to carry a substantial workload as well as heavy responsibility for a dysfunctional team.  “It was an easy choice to sign,” the Patterson said. “This is a massive club with huge history and the fanbase is tremendous. Obviously we aren’t in the place where we want to be right now but we can definitely get there with the talent in the changing room and staff here, and I have full belief we can do that. It was also great for me knowing the manager really wanted me here and that made my decision. When a club really wants you, it makes your mind up early on. I wanted to come here from the very start.” Patterson’s arrival follows that of the Ukraine international Vitaliy Mykolenko, the 22-year-old left-back who cost an initial £17.9m from Dynamo Kyiv and was unveiled before Sunday’s home defeat by Brighton. Time to adapt to the first transfers of their professional lives represents a luxury in Everton’s predicament, and one the manager is unable to afford. Benítez wanted to strengthen both full-back positions and midfield this month, having spent £1.7m during his first window as Everton navigated Premier League profit and sustainability rules. He was unaware of just how tight the financial constraints would be when agreeing to become Farhad Moshiri’s fifth, and most controversial, permanent managerial appointment in June. Another necessary rebuild was delayed as big earners remained on the wage bill – until September in the case of £200,000-a-week James Rodríguez – and an extensive injury list that has included the outfield spine of the team has exposed the squad’s well-known limitations. The job, as Benítez has admitted, has been far harder than advertised or anticipated. Yet Goodison Park is not a toxic, disillusioned place (a strange mix, admittedly) that boos Salomón Rondón simply because Benítez once managed Liverpool and dismissed Everton as a small club. Moshiri’s appointment was divisive, disregarded supporters’ emotional connection to their club and guaranteed patience would evaporate at the first sign of trouble. But a crowd that afforded Benítez a rapturous reception before his debut in August has turned for the simple, time-honoured reasons of results and performances. Both have been dire and while there have been legitimate excuses for the downward spiral (that Benítez has seized upon too readily), the manager has presented his detractors with several open goals after an encouraging start. Brighton on Sunday was the worst example so far. Everton had a clear fortnight to prepare because of three consecutive postponements and Dominic Calvert-Lewin back after a four-month absence. Yet Benítez’s switch to a wing-back system sowed confusion and his choice of Coleman over Lucas Digne on the left was a self-defeating act of stubbornness. A fallout over tactics is believed to be behind Digne’s ostracism, with the manager wanting the creative France international to concentrate on his defending, although other, more basic factors may be at play. Digne is a sellable asset at a club that has few. And Benítez likes a tall full-back. At 5ft 10in and 6ft 1in respectively, Mykolenko and Patterson may not be mountainous but they bring more height to a weak backline than 5ft 9in Digne and 5ft 8in Coleman. Everton head to Hull in the FA Cup on Saturday on the back of a dreadful run of eight defeats and one win from their past 11 Premier League games. A return of 19 points from 18 league games is the club’s lowest haul since 2005-06. On previous form Moshiri would have been expected to sack his manager by now. Instead he has backed him, and at considerable cost given Everton’s finances and the impact of the pandemic on the entire industry. Benítez needs to unearth evidence for the strong second half to the season that he has repeatedly promised and quickly.",Sport/Football,Benítez gets his man in Patterson but only wins can end Everton toxicity | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/rafael-benitez-nathan-patterson-wins-everton-toxicity
1/5/2022,"My aunt Mary Fraser, who has died aged 91, was head of the Inner London Education Authority’s visionary Unified Language Service (ULS) from the late 1960s until its abolition in 1990, helping to shape the teaching of English as a second language to immigrant and refugee children. During her time at the ULS Mary championed the idea of teaching English to newly arrived pupils by integrating them into mainstream classrooms – a more inclusive approach that helped to change attitudes as well as policy within state education at a time when students were separated according to their different abilities. Under her direction, the ULS also fought to include the traditions, politics and histories of its new students’ home countries within an Anglocentric syllabus.  Mary was born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, to Hilda (nee Walker) and her husband, Fred Fraser, a sales rep at a watch and clock making company. She went to Cheltenham Ladies college before going on to Westfield College (now Queen Mary University of London), from which she graduated in 1951 in French and Italian. Her career teaching English as a foreign language began with the British Council in Sweden and Brazil, and in the late 60s she was selected to lead the ULS, which expanded under her leadership from its first office in Islington’s Centre for Urban Education Studies to have bases in 12 London boroughs. Throughout her career and time at the ULS she continued to teach abroad during school holidays in countries such as Syria, Nigeria, and again Brazil. The abolition of the ILEA prompted Mary to take early retirement, but she continued teaching in other ways, including via a long association with a group of Eritrean child refugees whom she had met in south London not long after their arrival in the UK. Initially teaching them English, she also acted as a mentor throughout their school years until their first jobs, developing a form of extended family relationship and lifelong friendships. In later years Mary researched and led history walks around London with the University of the Third Age and its Shape of London architectural group. She also pursued her longstanding love of chamber music, often attending as many as three concerts a week. Mary was a generous, kind and fearless spirit who showed exemplary dedication to the communities that she was part of. She remained sharp and active to the end of her life. She is survived by her sister Jean, me, and a cousin, Anthony.",News/Education,Mary Fraser obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/04/mary-fraser-obituary
1/5/2022,"Ten minutes prior to the announcement of the verdict in the Elizabeth Holmes trial on Monday, reporters in San Jose, California, tweeted a heads up that the jury had returned. The news hit Twitter like oil on a hot frying pan, triggering not only anticipation, but a frisson of spite. Holmes, whose outfits over the course of the 15-week trial – dowdy, pale, and unthreatening – were interpreted as a contrivance equal to the black turtlenecks before them, isn’t a sympathetic figure, and there is always satisfaction to seeing confidence tricksters called out. But the level of enjoyment in her ruin, it seems to me, falls outside the normal range. “Ha,” I thought childishly when the guilty verdict came in. “Serves her right.” This was a particular and not wholly flattering form of schadenfreude. Holmes was found guilty of defrauding her investors on four counts; she was found not guilty on four counts relating to defrauding patients; and the jury couldn’t reach a verdict on three further counts. In all likelihood she will go to jail, and the sheer size of the numbers involved – Holmes defrauded investors to the tune of almost $1bn – will affect the length of her sentence. None of which quite explains the scale of contempt for the woman. I can’t summon a particular face or any real antipathy towards the board members of Enron. I loathe the architects of the 2008 financial crisis in a vague way that has never attached to a single image. Here is Holmes, however, with her too-red lipstick and wispy hair; and up it comes, a violent surge of dislike.  Obviously there are sexist biases involved, which knowing them to be such does little to neutralise. The woman thing aside, however, it’s clear that in the popular imagination, Holmes is carrying the can for a lot of unpunished hubris. Jeff Bezos with his ludicrous space hobby; ditto Elon Musk, with his mad tweets and – if we’re going to bring hair into it – ludicrous solution to baldness. If Holmes did something shady to investors, her greater crime was being part of a wealth class that has separated itself from the rest of humanity. It makes you wonder about Leonardo da Vinci – were people sitting around the coffee shops of early 16th-century Florence, bitching about what a big-headed arsehole he was and hoping for his imminent demise? Did we feel this way when Martha Stewart went down? One could write the whole thing all off as class envy were it not linked to some deeper dismay at the world into which we have apparently sleepwalked, one in which the grifters and influencers of Silicon Valley have come to inherit the Earth. Most of them appear to be bomb proof. Liars and plagiarists can lay low for a few years, before popping up to start peddling baloney again. What makes it worse is that, for the space of a few years, many of us willingly drank the Kool-Aid. Facebook allowed us to keep in touch with far-flung friends and family. Social media democratised marginalised voices. Getting a taxi was easier than it had ever been. All these things may be true, but they are not the whole truth, particularly at this time of year when one is encouraged to take stock and remind oneself, sternly, that happiness is sitting on a rock reading a book, or learning to play the harp. Instead, here we go again, passed out on the sofa not merely scrolling, but hate-scrolling. Which brings us to Elizabeth Holmes. What happened at Theranos, the creation of a phoney blood-testing technology, was not a “victimless crime”, but the victims, according to the court, were a plucky group of venture capitalists that it’s safe to say no one will be rustling up a quick crowdfunding campaign for. Regarded in a different light, and overlooking the patients for whom this technology was intended, Holmes almost did us a favour, exposing the credulousness of a system intent only on profit. But that’s not how it landed. The story had nothing to do with me, I thought, not for the first time, but there it was; a thrill of satisfaction when the verdict came through, that was only vaguely related to justice.

1/5/2022,"When Julia Cooper had her first child, she decided to breastfeed so that she could take her out on long walks through nature, one of her favourite hobbies. But that suddenly changed when she spotted a man pointing a long lens camera towards her as she breastfed her baby daughter on a park bench in Greater Manchester.After twisting her baby out of view, feeling unnerved, and noticing he continued to stare, she approached the man to ask him whether he was taking photos of her. He replied that he had the right to do so, since they were in a public park. “I was just so shocked and turned away with my baby so he couldn’t get any more photos, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it – it was really bothering me,” Cooper said.Still rattled that evening, she called Greater Manchester police. Although sympathetic to her distress, they said there was no law against breastfeeding voyeurism, and as a result they were unable to help.But for Cooper the incident transformed her life. She no longer felt able to take her daughter out for long stretches of time, and would hide in her car whenever she needed to breastfeed her daughter. “I was left feeling so disgusted, disturbed and angry that this man had got away with taking photos of me and my daughter,” she said.“I only tried breastfeeding once in public again, and it just ruined the experience for me. I was looking at everybody around thinking: are they going to photograph me.”Distraught by the lack of action, Cooper turned to her MP, Jeff Smith, for help. Together with Stella Creasy, one of the few MPs who is a young mother and who has experienced breastfeeding voyeurism herself, he launched a campaign under the slogan Stop the Breast Pest, which has resulted in the creation of a new offence of breastfeeding voyeurism, which is being put before parliament on Tuesday.Cooper said the proposed new law would provide much-needed reassurance to mothers such as herself that “you can breastfeed in peace”.Creasy’s own experience of breastfeeding voyeurism took place on an overground train in London, when she noticed that a boy seated opposite her was filming her breastfeeding her baby.  “You’re sat on the train and you think: what’s that person opposite doing?. Then you realise with horror, you suddenly think: Oh my god, can you see anything? I just wanted to get out, I felt embarrassed, I felt humiliated and I wanted to get away,” she said.Creasy said that since the incident she had spoken to many young mothers who had shared similar experiences, and she thinks this may be connected with the UK’s comparatively low rates of breastfeeding.But she is pleased to now be able to tell them that “if you get breast pests in future they will be held to account”.“We need to make sure that mums know they can complain and that police forces should act,” she said. Women who spoke to campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed described their experiences of being stared at, filmed and photographed while breastfeeding. One recalled how a man had asked her: “Is it my turn next?” as she breastfed her three-month-old child. “I can imagine many women are anxious about breastfeeding in public and drawing attention to themselves at the best of times, but something like that could really put them off,” she said. Others described feeling unnerved by sustained eye contact for up to 10 minutes. One said the person “kept shifting to get a better look” and held her gaze when she tried to shame him into looking away, while another said she had felt so uncomfortable she had called her husband to collect her.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Ruined the experience for me’: mother’s story of breastfeeding voyeurism,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/breastfeeding-voyeurism-mothers-story
1/5/2022,"Ashley Giles has apologised for England’s failed Ashes campaign but warned that sacking the coach, the captain or even himself as the director of men’s cricket will change little unless the entire game addresses its systemic shortcomings.  Recently arrived in Sydney, Giles is compiling a report into a series England trail 3-0 against Australia going into the fourth Test. He held off from addressing the futures of Chris Silverwood, the head coach who is isolating with Covid-19, and Joe Root, the captain, given the final result of the series remains outstanding. Nevertheless, the 48-year-old stressed broader issues than just personnel or tactical missteps were at play for a Test record in 2021 of four wins, two draws and nine losses. Giles cited the pandemic, fixture congestion and the numbing effects of bubble life, plus quality opposition and a struggle to bridge the gap between county cricket and the top level. “I absolutely feel the responsibility of losing this Ashes series,” Giles said. “We all do and we can only apologise. I know there will be a lot of emotion, a lot of anger about how we’ve lost it. But we know it’s not an easy place to come. In the last 34 years we’ve come here and won once [in 2010-11]. “We’ve not done well in terms of results. In the 1990s [a similar record] was accepted as normal for England leaderships and they got away with it. We set our standards much higher than that.” Pressed on this, given English cricket is second only to India in terms of resources, he replied: “That’s what we’re aiming for. But unless we look at more systemic change, a collective responsibility and collective solutions, we can make whatever changes we want – you can change me, the head coach, the captain – but we’re only setting up future leaders for failure. That’s all we’re doing. We’re only pushing it down the road.” Giles said his review will look into why players do not appear to improve in the current Test setup. While this did not sound overly promising for Silverwood, who he appointed in 2019, a strong first 14 months that featured away wins in South Africa and Sri Lanka, and included West Indies and Pakistan being beaten at home, was noted. But in the last year when England – now ranked fourth – faced the top three sides in India, New Zealand and Australia the gulf became evident. A selection whirlpool was amplified by rest periods afforded to players during the 3-1 away defeat in India, and bled into the summer; those handed breaks still played in the Indian Premier League that followed, before going on to miss the 1-0 home defeat by New Zealand. Though 12-month central contracts seem to only mean 10 in practice, Giles had no regrets about trying to manage the draining effects of biosecure bubbles while fulfilling England’s fixtures. Test matches would still have been missed, he insisted, even if given full priority over the T20 World Cup that preceded the Ashes. “The last two years have probably been the most challenging of my career,” Giles said. “Performance has almost been the last thing we’ve had to think about. And that’s a really sad situation. But have we got the game on? Have we tried to keep the players fit and well? Yes, we’ve tried. And the wellbeing issue is a massive one.” England’s 21 Tests since the start of the pandemic is three times that of Australia but, though calling the pile‑up “horrendous”, Giles stressed he had no input into a schedule decided at board level. A three-Test tour of the Caribbean in March will still require restricted environments and Covid-19 testing regimes, with a foreboding “I think the guys are at their very top limit of dealing with that” added here. It was Giles who handed the job of picking squads to Silverwood when removing Ed Smith and dissolving the national selector role last summer but he remains defiant on the principle. There were few obvious omissions who would have made any difference in Australia, he said, even if the selection of XIs is another issue he will explore. Giles also raised the rain-affected warm-up period and, like many, put the failed tour primarily down to the standard of English batting. On the dearth of Test-quality players here, as well as proven spinners or seamers quicker than 87mph (Mark Wood and the injured Jofra Archer aside), he pointed to the domestic system as a whole. “If that’s a failing of this leadership, that’s been a failing of many leaderships before us,” Giles said. “Are we creating [domestic] conditions that will allow us to better prepare our cricketers for playing in the conditions out here? I’m not sure we are at the moment. “What we play, when we play, on what [pitches] we play – that’s a collective responsibility. It’s up to us as ECB but also a conversation to have with the counties.” Giles will submit his final report to the England and Wales Cricket Board, which has grappled with a racism crisis in the past year and appears itself to be suffering from a leadership vacuum given Tom Harrison’s expected departure this year and no chair in place. There is also a lack of cricket experience here too, with Giles’s predecessor, Andrew Strauss, the only former men’s Test player in the room – and he is an adviser with no vote. “In terms of my position, that’s not for me to decide,” Giles said. “You can clearly tell by the way that I’m talking that I’m thinking very much about the future and how we take this team forward.” When Giles enhanced Silverwood’s role last April he said “his head is on the block” and “if we lose in Australia, the pressure is on all of us”. The review has begun and the solutions will apparently follow but that scenario has certainly come to pass.",Sport/Sport,Giles calls for systemic change in English cricket after Ashes defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/giles-calls-for-systemic-change-in-english-cricket-after-ashes-defeat
1/5/2022,"Andy Beckett points out the risks in Keir Starmer’s talk of “the national interest” (Is Keir Starmer’s professed patriotism a strength or a weakness?, 31 December). He acknowledges that Clement Attlee successfully rode his patriotism to electoral success in 1945. But where Attlee’s patriotism seemed a genuine conviction, there’s been an expediency to Labour leaders draping themselves in the union flag lately. It comes across as a panicky reaction to bad opinion polls rather than a genuine love of country. The British public can sense this disingenuousness and they don’t take kindly to it. Where the left falls down is that, in its rush to be ostentatiously progressive, it has abandoned the field of patriotism and allowed it to be churned up and rehashed in the shape of a slightly nasty nativism à la Priti Patel. Unless Labour actively makes a different case, though, rather than simply playing dress-up, Starmer can scream until he’s red, white and blue in the face. Nobody will take him seriously so long as the only vision of patriotism is the one presented by the send-them-back brigade of Tory ministers, because they might as well vote for the people who really believe it.  There is hope for Labour yet; Starmer can still seize the initiative. He should stake the progressive left claim to patriotism, pointing out that Britain at its best is so much better than the parochial, them-and-us fortress of Tory hard-right dreams. This is the Britain that millions from different parts of the world have come to call home, the Britain that (even now) has a genuine claim to be a world leader in international aid, the Britain of vaccine pioneers, of community volunteers, of villages opening up their homes to refugees. Labour has so far missed a trick in not associating these things with what the UK can be as a nation. If it does so, Labour can start to redefine patriotism and reconquer the ground it abandoned to the Tories.Dr Hamid KhanLondon  In a good article, Andy Beckett refers on several occasions to Starmer’s patriotism. However, to which country or state is that patriotism attached? The article has a photograph of Starmer wearing an England football top. In less than 20 years, Labour has fallen from the majority party in Scotland to a single Westminster seat. Labour has never organised in Northern Ireland, where the “patriotic” parties are all unionists, whose preference is the Tories. In Wales, although Labour has most Westminster seats, it is in power in the Senedd due to a deal with Plaid Cymru and increasingly stresses its Welshness. So, Starmer’s patriotism seems to be an English nationalist patriotism. Increasingly, people in the four countries identify as English, Irish, Scots or Welsh, rather than British. But Labour has for decades been scared of saying what Englishness/Britishness connotes other than the royal family, the imperial history, war and the union flag. As far as the section of the public to whom these things matter are concerned, the Tories and parties further right do these things more convincingly. So, I think Mr Starmer will be “one of Labour’s patriotic failures”.Alasdair MacdonaldGlasgow  If Keir Starmer listened to Nesrine Malik (For Labour and the Conservatives, racism is really all about reputation management, 2 January) or, better still, asked her to be his chief adviser, Labour would reap the reward for being a party of principle, integrity and courage – a party I might once again be proud to be a member of.Alan WolinskiOtley, West Yorkshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While I personally have not engaged in direct disruptive action, I can see why some feel that they need to do more. The media, by and large, take no notice of polite expressions of concern. Even marches in the hundreds of thousands are regularly ignored. It is widely believed that only more extreme action attracts news coverage.  Might not progressive and socially responsible media such as the Guardian help here, by reporting, in a timely manner, more of the peaceful demonstrations by thoughtful people of their concerns about the green agenda, human rights, responsible politics etc? It would be good to know that extreme action is not (in the minds of some) excusable, because the views of concerned citizens will be reported without recourse first to potentially perilous or illegal behaviours. If the new intended legislation on demonstrations comes into force, the onus will lie even more on media outlets to report widely held green, social and ethical concerns in ways that do not require a minority of worried citizens to put themselves and/or others at risk.

1/5/2022,"Your report (‘Not if … but when’: Sinn Féin on path to power in Ireland, 28 December) refers to Sinn Féin as a party “founded in 1905”; this unfortunately omits important context in understanding modern Irish politics. The Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 was negotiated and supported by the British government and an Irish delegation led by Arthur Griffith, the founder of the original Sinn Féin party of 1905. Following intense debate, the treaty was passed in the Irish parliament (Dáil Éireann) in January 1922 to establish the Irish Free State.  In the June 1922 general election, almost 80% of votes cast were for pro-treaty candidates. The successful pro-treaty Sinn Féin party elected WT Cosgrave as president of the Irish Free State and the party changed its name to Cumann na nGaedheal (Association of the Irish), the precursor to today’s Fine Gael (Family of the Irish). Most of anti-treaty Sinn Féin were led by Éamon de Valera to become today’s Fianna Fáil. The small remaining rump of Sinn Féin maintained a policy of abstentionism to the Irish parliament, leading to a split in 1970 – those wishing to take their seats became Official Sinn Féin, and then the Workers’ party. Those wishing to maintain abstentionism called themselves Provisional Sinn Féin, which included a young Gerry Adams. By 1986, the Adams wing ended its policy of abstentionism and adopted a shorter name that no other party was using: Sinn Féin.Councillor David McManusFine Gael, South Dublin county council  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/5/2022,"Voyeurs who record images of breastfeeding women without permission and domestic abusers who escape jail because of time limits on prosecutions are being targeted by proposals put before parliament on Tuesday. A new offence of breastfeeding voyeurism, with a maximum sentence of two years, has been included by the Ministry of Justice in an amendment to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill.  It follows a campaign led by Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, who was photographed while feeding her four-month-old baby daughter on a train in north London. She has been working with Jeff Smith, the Labour MP for Manchester Withington, on a campaign under the slogan Stop the Breast Pest. Creasy told the Guardian last year she was breastfeeding on a train when she noticed a teenage boy laughing and taking pictures. “He had his phone out and I thought he was playing with his phone, and then I realised with horror that he was taking photos,” she said. “You feel exposed. I don’t think he can have got very much of a picture, but the sheer horror at the point when you’re focused on trying to support your newborn baby … and somebody is doing that, it was vile. Because I felt quite vulnerable, I just got off my train as soon as I could.” The new offence of breastfeeding voyeurism, which would apply in England and Wales, is one of two new amendments to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. There will be a two-year maximum sentence for those caught and prosecuted. Under a separate amendment, victims of domestic abuse will be allowed more time to report incidents of common assault or battery against them. Currently, prosecutions must commence within six months of the offence. Instead, this requirement will be moved to six months from the date the incident is formally reported to police – with an overall time limit of two years from the date of the offence to bring a prosecution. The government’s decision follows similar proposals put forward by Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, who tabled an amendment to the bill in the Commons last year. It followed the release of figures which showed that over 13,000 domestic abuse cases have been dropped by police over the last five years due to the time-limit. Welcoming the government’s amendments, Cooper said it is one of many measures Labour is pushing for to tackle violence against women and girls. Domestic abuse is often reported late relative to other crimes. The change is supposed to ensure that alleged victims have enough time to seek justice and that perpetrators answer for their actions. Dominic Raab, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, said: “We’re giving the victims of domestic abuse longer to report the offence to the police – so abusers don’t evade justice. “And we will introduce a new offence to stop people filming or taking photos of mothers breastfeeding without their consent – because no new mum should be harassed in this way.” The Voyeurism Act made it illegal to take a photograph under a person’s clothing without their consent but it does not specifically cover women who have to remove clothes to feed an infant. Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner, said: “It is important that all domestic abuse victims have the time and opportunity to report to the police. This is especially important following Covid restrictions, when many victims faced additional challenges to seeking help and reporting domestic abuse.” Reacting to the decision, Creasy said: “That breast pests can now be stopped is testament to the hard work of campaigner Julia Cooper, Jeff Smith, Lady Helene Hayman and Lord Pannick. We all worked across both the Lords and Commons to make the government listen to our call for change.”",News/Law,Breastfeeding voyeurs targeted by new proposed offence in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/breastfeeding-voyeurs-new-offence
1/5/2022,"The American social entrepreneur Phil Harvey, who has died aged 83, made contraception affordable for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world with subsidies provided by the profits from Adam & Eve, the sex shop company he founded in 1970. A committed libertarian, Harvey also used his considerable resources to champion the right to sexual healthcare and free speech in the US. While working in the Punjab in India in the 1960s for the charity Care International, Harvey became deeply uncomfortable about the way western countries distributed aid. A woman in a threadbare sari knelt before him in gratitude for the food he was doling out, and he became determined to find a way to give aid that did not humiliate recipients.  He also began to think that the most urgent need for people in developing countries was better access to family planning, and that the distribution of contraception was inherently a marketing rather than a medical issue. He theorised that the most effective way to distribute condoms might be to use social marketing techniques. This meant bypassing doctors and clinics and subsidising their sale in ordinary shops or market stalls, promoted through local advertising campaigns. Returning to the US in 1969, Harvey studied public health at the University of North Carolina, where he met a British doctor, Tim Black, who shared his zeal for family planning. Keen to test out Harvey’s social marketing ideas, they decided to see if they could persuade people in the US to buy condoms through the post, and ran eye-catching ads in 300 college magazines with slogans such as “What will you get her this Christmas – pregnant?” It was a risky business as it was illegal at the time to send contraceptives (deemed an “obscene product”) through the US postal system. However, an avalanche of orders arrived and no prosecutions ensued. Emboldened, in 1971 Harvey founded Adam & Eve, the first mail-order contraceptive business in the US, which he soon expanded to include the sale of erotica and sex aids and which now has a chain of retail stores. Business boomed, and using the proceeds from Adam & Eve, Harvey and Black founded Population Services International (PSI) a non-profit organisation that started a social marketing programme to sell condoms in Kenya. Adam & Eve customers had no idea they were subsidising cheap contraception abroad, and Harvey saw no reason to advertise the connection, arguing that altruism exists in a different part of the brain from wanting to have a good time on a Saturday night. When it came to starting up foreign programmes, he was also a hands-off manager, believing in hiring the best people locally, setting out his vision, and then allowing them to use their initiative to achieve the desired result. Harvey stepped down as leader of PSI in 1977, believing it was wrong for the founder to stay at the helm indefinitely. By that time he was in any case involved with a second organisation: Marie Stopes. The London family planning clinic had run into financial difficulties and in 1976 Harvey and Black rescued it, buying up its original clinic in Whitfield Street. Harvey became a long-term board member, helping it to grow from providing 150,000 women annually with contraception and safe abortions in the 70s to more than 12 million a year today. Finally, in 1989 Harvey founded DKT International, named in honour of his friend Dharmendra Kumar Tyagi, an official in charge of India’s family planning programme. It operates in a similar way to PSI, has subsidised the sale of more than one billion cheap contraceptives in 90 countries, and is active in sex education and HIV prevention. Harvey was born in Evanston, Illinois, to William, a farm tool supplier, and his wife, Lucy (nee Smith). The youngest of five siblings, taciturn, private and a deep thinker, he went to Harvard University in 1957 to study Slavic languages and literature. In 1963 he joined Care International to work in India, spending several years with the organisation before returning to the US and branching out with Black. As head of Adam & Eve and a committed libertarian, Harvey soon became embroiled in legal battles to defend people’s access to sexual healthcare. In 1977 he challenged a law in New York state that prohibited the advertising and display of contraceptives. The case went to the supreme court and he won, arguing that advertising was protected by the first amendment and the right to free speech. In 1986 Adam & Eve’s offices were raided by the police and Harvey was charged with disseminating obscenity. Ronald Reagan’s administration hoped to close down the adult entertainment industry and filed lawsuits against the company in many different states, trusting that the financial burden would make it buckle. But Harvey fought back, winning a lawsuit against the justice department in 1990 on the grounds that it had abused its power. In 1987 he had also successfully challenged Reagan’s Mexico City policy, known as the “global gag”, which aimed to prevent any organisation that received a grant from the US Agency for International Development from performing, referring to, or even speaking about, safe abortion care. To the end of his life Harvey supported organisations that fought to oppose government control of people’s private lives. He also founded the DKT Liberty Project, which campaigns on issues such as stopping the government from confiscating people’s assets, helping patients access medical marijuana, and safeguarding the right to free speech. He wrote about his work and philosophy in books that included Let Every Child Be Wanted (1999) and The Government vs Erotica (2001). He was also a novelist, writing, among other titles, the psychological thriller Show Time (2012). In 1990 Harvey married the artist Harriet Lesser. She survives him, as do her two children from a previous relationship, and three grandchildren.

1/5/2022,"Emma Watson has been accused of antisemitism by Israel’s former ambassador to the United Nations after she posted a message of support for the Palestinian cause. Watson, best known for playing Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, posted an image on Instagram showing a photograph of a pro-Palestinian protest with the banner “Solidarity is a Verb” written across it. It was accompanied with a quote about the meaning of solidarity from the intersectional feminist scholar Sara Ahmed.  While the post elicited widespread support from Palestinian activists, it drew strong criticism from Israeli officials. The most combative was Danny Danon, who formerly held the posts of science minister in Binyamin Netanyahu’s government and Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Sharing Watson’s post on Twitter, Dannon said: “10 points from Gryffindor for being an antisemite.” Israel’s current ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, was also critical. “Fiction may work in Harry Potter but it does not work in reality,” Erdan wrote. “If it did, the magic used in the wizarding world could eliminate the evils of Hamas (which oppresses women and seeks the annihilation of Israel) and the PA (which supports terror). I would be in favor of that!” PA refers to the Palestinian Authority. Danon’s comments were met with a backlash, including from Leah Greenberg, a co-executive director of Indivisible Project, a non-profit organisation founded in 2016 in response to the election of Donald Trump. “A perfect demonstration of the utterly cynical and bad-faith weaponization of antisemitism to shut down basic expressions of solidarity with the Palestinian people,” she wrote. The Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi called Danon’s comments “appalling”. “These constant attempts to stifle any and all support for Palestinians must be called out,” she said. No joke, we are at the point where merely posting a vague picture referencing solidarity with Palestinians on Instagram gets you labeled as an antisemite. It’s only Jan 3. May God give me patience for the this year. https://t.co/DsH4K9umtd Watson, 31, is an outspoken feminist who has used her platform to support a number of high-profile causes, earning her a spot on Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015. In 2014 she was appointed as a UN women’s goodwill ambassador and delivered an address at the UN headquarters in New York to launch HeForShe, a campaign that urges men to advocate for women’s equality. A year later Malala Yousafzai told Watson she had decided to call herself a feminist after hearing her speech. Watson was appointed to a G7 advisory body for women’s rights in 2019, consulting with leaders on foreign policy. During Cop26 in Glasgow last year, Watson gave climate activists access to her Instagram account. Her bio still says the account “has been taken over by an anonymous Feminist Collective”. The image posted by Watson’s account was originally created by the Bad Activist Collective during clashes last year in which Israeli jets bombed Gaza in response to rocket attacks. At the time other celebrities including Bella Hadid, Dua Lipa and Susan Sarandon expressed their solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Ahmed’s full quote, cited in part by Watson, said: “Solidarity does not assume that our struggles are the same struggles, or that our pain is the same pain, or that our hope is for the same future. Solidarity involves commitment, and work, as well as the recognition that even if we do not have the same feelings, or the same lives, or the same bodies, we do live on common ground.” Watson’s post has been liked by more than a million users and attracted more than 100,000 comments – many of which include either Palestinian or Israeli flags.",News/World news,Emma Watson pro-Palestinian post sparks antisemitism row,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/emma-watson-pro-palestinian-post-sparks-antisemitism-row
