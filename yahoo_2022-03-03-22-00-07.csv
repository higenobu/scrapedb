3/3/2022,"A Russian businessman has placed a $1m bounty on Vladimir Putin’s head and urged the country’s military officers to bring the president to justice. Entrepreneur Alex Konanykhin made the promise in a post on social media site LinkedIn and called it his “moral duty” to take action and help Ukraine following the unprovoked attack. “I promise to pay $1,000,000 to the officer(s) who, complying with their constitutional duty, arrest(s) Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws,” wrote Mr Konanykhin. “Putin is not the Russian president as he came to power as the result of a special operation of blowing up apartment buildings in Russia, then violated the Constitution by eliminating free elections and murdering his opponents.” His post included a photo of Mr Putin, with the caption, “Wanted: Dead or alive. Vladimir Putin for mass murder.” And he added: “As an ethnic Russian and a Russia citizen, I see it as my moral duty to facilitate the denazification of Russia. I will continue my assistance to Ukraine in its heroic efforts to withstand the onslaught of Putin’s Orda.” The word “Orda” is Russian for “horde.” Mr Konanykhin has a complicated history with the Russian government, and in 1996 was arrested while living in the US after Russian authorities claimed he had embezzled $8m from the Russian Exchange Bank. FBI agents testified that the Russian mafia had taken out a contract on Mr Konanykhin, and the case was settled and he was granted political asylum. His asylum was revoked several years later, but his deportation was eventually cancelled by US District Judge T S Ellis, who overruled it, who said that a decision to return him to Moscow “stinks”. Mr Konanykhin’s reference to blowing up buildings relates to a conspiracy theory that the Russian intelligence service, the FSB – which Mr Putin was head of from 1998 to 1999 – was responsible for explosions in four apartment blocks in 1999 which killed about 300 people. The attacks, blamed on Chechen terrorists, helped spark the Second Chechen War, which itself helped consolidate Mr Putin’s popularity in Russia. He became prime minister in 1999 and was named acting president on the last day of the year, subsequently being elected to a full term the following March. The theory was expounded among others by former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who was assassinated in London in 2006 – apparently by Russian agents – using the radioactive isotope polonium-210.",World/The Independent,Russian businessman places $1m bounty on Vladimir Putin’s head,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-businessman-places-1m-bounty-231620021.html

 Retired Gen. David Petraeus believes Russia President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is not a war he can win due to inadequate troop numbers and fierce Ukrainian resistance. ""I don't think that this is a war, ultimately, that Russia and Vladimir Putin can win,"" Petraeus said Wednesday in an interview with CNN. ""They can take a city perhaps, but they cannot hold it."" Petraeus, a commander in U.S. insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Russia doesn't ""have the numbers"" and beyond that, ""everyone in the entire country hates them and most of the adults are willing to take action against them, whether it's to take up weapons or to be human shields."" In addition, ""you have a president who is providing Churchillian leadership, the people [are] undaunted and Ukrainian forces continue to exploit their home-field advantage."" Ukraine has defied expectations and continued to hold its capital and most of its major cities a little under a week after the Kremlin launched an incursion into the country. Russian troops have been slow to move on Kyiv as they struggle with logistical problems such as lack of food and gas, reports of low morale, and intense resistance from Ukrainian forces, according to the Pentagon. But Petraeus warned that as Putin grows more frustrated with his forces halting progress, it will lead Russian troops ""to do more of what we have seen in the last 48 hours"" and step up the severity of their attacks using more devastating weapons targeting government facilities and infrastructure such as hospitals and schools. ""They'll starve the population of Kyiv if they have to but that population I don't think is going to crack,"" he said. Though Ukraine has held its ground, the conflict has still been devastating for the population, with more than 2,000 civilians killed since Thursday, with the invasion began, according to the country's emergency service. And nearly 900,000 Ukrainians have fled the country, according to figures from the United Nations.",World/The Hill,Gen.

3/3/2022,"Ukrainian authorities said captured Russian tanks wouldn't be counted as part of citizens' income. They said that seized tanks and military equipment need not be declared for tax purposes. They said such items would be considered a ""manifestation of the unity and cohesion"" of Ukrainians. Ukrainian authorities have reassured citizens that they don't need to declare captured Russian tanks or any equipment they pick up as personal income. ""Have you captured a Russian tank or armored personnel carrier and are worried about how to declare it? Keep calm and continue to defend the Motherland!"" a statement from the Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention seen by Interfax-Ukraine said. ""There is no need to declare the captured Russian tanks and other equipment, because the cost of this ... does not exceed 100 living wages,"" or 248,100 Ukrainian hryvnia, the agency said, according to Interfax-Ukraine. The sum equates to about $8,300. On the agency's website, a document dated Monday said the seizure of tanks or equipment would be considered a ""manifestation of the unity and cohesion of the Ukrainian people in the fight against invaders"" and would not be taxable. ""Thanks to the courage and victory of the defenders of the Ukrainian state, hostile military equipment, weapons, and other armor arrive as scrap. It is impossible to evaluate such objects in accordance with the Law of Ukraine,"" it said. Ukraine has fiercely resisted Russia's invasion, which began on Thursday. Amid the conflict, images have emerged that appear to show abandoned Russian military vehicles in Ukraine.
