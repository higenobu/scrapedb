4/20/2022,"Credit Suisse has announced that it is likely to report a first quarter loss owing to a jump in legal costs, as the beleaguered bank tries to draw a line under a string of scandals. The Swiss lender issued the profit warning before its scheduled earnings report next week, saying it would be putting aside an extra 600m Swiss francs (CHF) (£485m) after “developments in a number of previously disclosed legal matters” that started more than a decade ago. The bank said it “would expect to report a loss as a consequence of this increase in reserves”. Credit Suisse did not confirm which legal cases had forced it to put aside the extra cash. However, the market notice comes nearly a month after a Bermuda court ruled against Credit Suisse in a long-running legal battle with the former Georgian prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, who it said was the victim of fraud committed by a former banker, Pascale Lescaudron. Lescaudron was sentenced to five years in prison in 2018 after admitting to forging client signatures to divert money and make stock bets without their knowledge. The banker killed himself in 2020. The court ruled in March that Ivanishvili and his family were due damages worth more than $500m (£385m). Credit Suisse also told investors on Wednesday that its financial results would be knocked back by another 200m CHF because of its exposure to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted in a swathe of sanctions against politicians, oligarchs and Russian businesses. That is on top of a drop in investment banking activity, as fewer firms raise money on the financial markets and hold back from mergers and takeovers. The first quarter loss extends a challenging period for the bank, which in February reported a 2bn CHF loss for the fourth quarter and faced scrutiny after the Credit Suisse secrets leak, which showed it hid wealth for clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes over decades. It followed an unprecedented year of controversies in which the bank became embroiled in the collapse of the supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital and the US hedge fund Archegos Capital, and was fined £350m over its role in a loan scandal in Mozambique. The bank also lost its chairman, the former Lloyds chief executive António Horta-Osório, in January, after he twice broke Covid-19 regulations, and became the first big Swiss bank to face criminal charges in its home country after allegations it helped launder money on behalf of the Bulgarian mafia. It has denied the charges.",News/Business,Credit Suisse issues profit warning caused by jump in legal costs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/20/credit-suisse-issues-profit-warning-caused-by-jump-in-legal-costs
4/20/2022,"A widower who could not hold his dying wife’s hand because of Covid restrictions has said Boris Johnson’s attendance at a Downing Street party betrayed people who obeyed lockdown rules and called the prime minister’s personal apology to him insincere. John Robinson, 80, whose wife, Pat, died aged 73 from coronavirus in the first wave in 2020, called on Johnson to quit over his rule-breaking and urged MPs to back a Labour motion to trigger a parliamentary investigation into whether Johnson misled parliament. Johnson was fined for breaking lockdown restrictions after a police investigation, in what is believed to be the first instance of a sitting prime minister being criminally sanctioned. Robinson’s case was raised in the House of Commons on Tuesday by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, after Johnson apologised “unreservedly” for attending the party for his 56th birthday. But Johnson continued to insist it did not occur to him, then or subsequently, that he was breaking the rules. In a sign that public anger shows no sign of abating as Tory backbenchers weigh up their continuing support for the PM, Robinson said on Wednesday this explanation was “nonsense” and Johnson was “sticking two fingers up to the rest of us”. Robinson, a former headteacher, who has two daughters and three grandchildren, wrote to the Guardian last week explaining how his wife’s funeral was attended by only six mourners, in line with the rules. “Our son-in-law had to stay at home as he would have been the forbidden seventh mourner,” he wrote, while “Johnson flouted his own laws and rules ... Anger doesn’t even touch the sides of how I feel about this pathetic excuse for a man.” The party in Downing Street on 19 June 2020 reportedly featured a cake, singing, and about 30 guests, including the interior designer Lulu Lytle and the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson. Gatherings at the time were permitted for up to six people outdoors, but not permitted indoors. Robinson’s fury at Johnson is not isolated among the bereaved. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group called his apology “the words of someone who is sorry they have been caught, not someone who regrets the harm they have done”. It is calling for Tory backbenchers to remove the prime minister from office. Safiah Ngah, a spokesperson for the group, whose father, Dr Zahari Ngah, died of Covid in January 2021, said: “[Johnson’s] claim that he didn’t realise rules were being broken is just laughable and shows he still takes us for idiots.” “He is either stupid and he doesn’t understand his own laws or he is lying,” said Robinson, adding that not being able to have a full funeral or any sort of wake had denied his family an important part of the grieving process. Pat Robinson, a former secondary school teacher, died of Covid on 11 April 2020 after contracting the virus in a nursing home in Sutton Coldfield where she was living with dementia. Challenged about the Robinson family’s experience, Johnson told MPs: “I apologise once again, profusely, to John Robinson, to all of those who lost loved ones, and particularly to those who suffered during the pandemic.” Robinson said on Wednesday: “I didn’t feel there was any sincerity in it at all. The way that he behaved is just taking us for mugs.” “It was just a form of words that he thinks might get him through it. There is a principle at stake where, if you are the leader, there comes a time when you have to say, ‘I messed up badly, it’s time to go.’ It’s a matter of trust. I think he has betrayed us, the people who obeyed the rules and sacrificed a lot.” On Tuesday, the senior Tory MP Mark Harper became the latest backbencher to call for Johnson to go, saying: “I no longer think he is worthy of the great office that he holds.” Robinson said he agreed: “I thought he was very brave to stand up and say that.” He contrasted that with the stance of his own MP, Michael Fabricant, who claimed teachers and nurses were drinking in staffrooms after work during lockdowns. “It is up to [Conservative MPs] to look at their consciences and decide whether they want to behave in a decent way or condone his betrayal of the British public,” he said. “We put a lot of trust in the great offices of state and when somebody trashes those offices and what they stand for, I don’t think that is forgivable.”",News/Politics,"‘Insincere’: Covid-bereaved man, 80, rejects Boris Johnson partygate apology",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/insincere-covid-bereaved-man-80-rejects-boris-johnson-partygate-apology
4/20/2022,"It is only four years since the director David Alden placed Wagner’s Lohengrin firmly inside an oppressive and febrile wartime setting for the Royal Opera. Today, Alden’s approach, now in the hands of Peter Relton in this first revival, feels disturbingly prescient in light of current events in Europe; the opera’s setting in a divided society threatened by war from the east has shed its historical trappings and instead become unexpectedly contemporary. Not everything works entirely persuasively in Alden’s visceral presentation of Lohengrin’s Brabant as a quasi-fascist society, its public square dominated by an Albert Speer-style swan monument. Not least Lohengrin’s own music, especially in act three, which shows him to be anything but a fascist leader, and the militarism and red-and-black flag-waving of the production feels overdone as a consequence. But the pervading darkness of Adam Silverman’s lighting and the expressionist angularity of Paul Steinberg’s claustrophobic sets make this an unusually powerful revival. The sole concession to the romanticism that made Lohengrin so popular in the early 20th century is a reproduction on the bridal chamber wall of a mural of the swan knight from one of King Ludwig II of Bavaria’s castles. The message that the old Lohengrin is played out was clear. Musically, the revival is built on extremely strong foundations. Jakub Hrůša has an unerring sense of the work’s structure, never trying to force the score. The Royal Opera orchestra’s playing in the great scene between Lohengrin’s two enemies, Telramund and Ortrud, in act two was gripping. But in this most choral of all Wagner’s operas it was a night on which the Royal Opera chorus seized a chance to shine. They were magnificent. As Lohengrin, Brandon Jovanovich has the presence and heroic tenor ring that much of the score requires, although in some of the more intimate passages of act three there were signs of vocal pressure. Jennifer Davis repeated the expressive and well-judged Elsa that made such a mark in 2018. Craig Colclough stormed to fine effect as the hapless Telramund, and Gábor Bretz brought vocal nobility to King Heinrich. As so often in Lohengrin, however, it was Ortrud, here sung with unremitting fire by Anna Smirnova, who seized the attention. The malevolent pagan outsider from the north seems to have wandered into the opera from the as-yet unwritten Ring cycle, and Smirnova grabbed the opportunity with both hands.  Lohengrin is at the Royal Opera House in London until 14 May.",Arts/Music,Lohengrin review – powerful and prescient production strips Wagner’s opera of its romance,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/20/lohengrin-review-wagner-david-alden-peter-relton-royal-opera-house
4/20/2022,"The main work in Paul McCreesh and his Gabrieli Consort and Players’ Bach concert at the Wigmore was the Easter Oratorio, which we don’t hear nearly as often as we should. Originally written as a cantata for Easter Sunday in 1725, it was revised as an oratorio 10 years later. With just under an hour’s music, it’s relatively short when placed beside Bach’s Passions. And, unlike Handelian oratorio, it is rooted primarily in reflection rather than dramatic narrative. “Reflective”, however, doesn’t even begin to describe the impact it makes with its elated opening and closing choruses, recitatives for multiple soloists that veer at times towards operatic arioso, and successive arias with woodwind obbligatos. It’s meditative, exalted and among the most beautiful things in Bach’s output. McCreesh and his musicians performed it wonderfully well. Using just four singers and 19 players resulted in crystal-clear counterpoint, its sheer complexity adding to the elan of the opening sinfonia and chorus. The arias were exquisite, particularly Sanfte, Soll Mein Todeskummer for tenor (Hugo Hymas, excellent) and two recorders (Rebecca Miles and Ian Wilson), the emotional and theological fulcrum of the work, a meditation on how Christ’s resurrection has turned death into little more than sleep. Rowan Pierce was the silvery soprano, Tim Mead the warm-voiced countertenor. A glorious work, quite superbly done. Its companion pieces were the Sinfonia from Am Abend Aber Desselbigen Sabbats, a cantata for the Sunday after Easter, and another comparative rarity, the Mass in G Minor, written around 1739. That the latter isn’t a towering masterpiece like the immense Mass in B Minor is no reason to ignore it, as it contains some remarkable things, most notably, perhaps, the breathtaking counterpoint at the start of the Gloria, which really suggests multiple voices excitedly raised in praise of God’s glory. Again the performance was superb and exhilarating, the choruses wonderfully clear, the arias done with admirable poise: bass Matthew Brook, who had comparatively little to do in the Oratorio, came into his own here with the Gratias Agimus Tibi, sung with great fervour and warmth.",Arts/Music,Gabrieli Consort & Players/McCreesh review – superb and exhilarating Bach,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/20/gabrieli-consort-players-paul-mccreesh-review-bach-easter-oratorio-wigmore-hall

4/20/2022,"The actor Juliet Stevenson has made an 11-hour plea to Conservative MPs voting on the government’s controversial immigration bill on Wednesday to “be brave and vote with your heart, not with your party membership card”. Stevenson has urged MPs who are backing the nationality and borders bill to instead back amendments in support of refugees. Stevenson was one of a group of celebrities and refugees who boarded a boat on the Thames on Wednesday morning decorated with blue and yellow bunting in solidarity with Ukraine, orange hearts in support of refugees and a large blue and yellow banner saying: “Vote to protect not punish refugees.” Refugees from Ukraine and other conflict zones were joined by celebrities including Stevenson, Robert Rinder, the model Lily Cole, author Kathy Lette and comedian Deborah Frances-White. The boat sailed around a stretch of the Thames that is overlooked by the Houses of Parliament in the hope of catching the eye of MPs and persuading them to do a last-minute U-turn and not vote in support of the bill later on Wednesday. Stevenson, who is hosting a Ukrainian refugee named Dartsa and her six-year-old daughter, Orysia, both of whom joined her onboard, is a longstanding advocate for refugee rights. She said that while government was on a “downward trajectory” in terms of attitudes to refugees, the public was clearly headed in the opposite direction. “The nationality and borders bill is the most brutal piece of legislation to have ever gone through parliament,” she said. Stevenson, Dartsa and Orysia say the two families are getting along well and have bonded with the family dog, Millie. Stevenson said doing something practical like hosting was helping with “processing the horror” of what was happening in Ukraine. Dartsa said: “It was a great relief to come to the UK with my little girl and know that we are safe from the terrible war in our country. Of course, it is not easy and I worry all the time for all those back home. But my family back there and I are so grateful to Juliet and her family for opening their door to us. I can only hope that nobody has to experience what we are now, but this welcome is a huge comfort at such an awful time.” Robert Rinder, whose grandfather was a Holocaust survivor, said that protecting and welcoming refugees was “an absolutely fundamental part of British values”. “We need to have a humane, sensible and fair policy towards refugees,” he said. Wednesday’s event was organised by Together With Refugees, a coalition of more than 400 organisations across the country, who support refugees fleeing war and persecution. The coalition is calling for a better approach to supporting refugees that allows people to seek safety in the UK, no matter how they came here and ensures people can live in dignity while they wait to find out if they will be granted asylum. Together With Refugees is calling on MPs to vote to accept amendments to the bill, including scrapping the proposal to punish refugees who arrive in the UK on a boat across the Channel or in the back of a lorry. MPs are also being urged to agree that the government must publish an annual target for the number of refugees it will resettle in the UK. Campaigners would want this target to be at least 10,000 refugees from around the world each year.",News/World news,‘Vote with your heart’: Juliet Stevenson joins protest against UK immigration bill,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/vote-with-your-heart-juliet-stevenson-joins-protest-against-uk-immigration-bill
4/20/2022,"Anote for anyone unfamiliar with the Depression-era bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow: they died in the end. In the musical Bonnie & Clyde, they die in the beginning, too. A tableau of the couple slumped in their Ford V8 surrounded by gun-toting cops opens the show, thereby ensuring (along with the bullet-riddled set) that everything else is seen through our knowledge of their demise. Admirers of the (non-musical) 1967 film may be surprised to find the romantic elements of the story largely unsullied. Whereas Arthur Penn’s movie was a scathing portrait, dwelling for example on Clyde’s impotence and the duo’s brutality, the show – with book by Ivan Menchell and generic, rootin’-tootin’ songs by Don Black and Frank Wildhorn – is a paean to two crazy kids who just wanted to be stars. Frances Mayli McCann is a charming Bonnie, distracted by thoughts of her idol Clara Bow even during moments of high drama, while Jordan Luke Gage is so likable as Clyde, who is as smitten with himself as he is with Bonnie, that he could afford to ramp up the savagery a little. George Maguire is nicely grizzled as Clyde’s devoted brother Buck, and Natalie McQueen has a giddy Megan Mullally-like energy as Buck’s wife, Blanche. Her voice, with its helium highs and guttural growls, is an exemplary comic tool, but she can turn up the heat when need be, as she does in Bonnie and Blanche’s duet, You Love Who You Love. The cast could scarcely give it more gusto – Ako Mitchell also brings gravitas as the Preacher – but they are hobbled by a script that never works out what it wants to say, or why it’s saying it. Allusions to the pair seeking fame for fame’s sake aren’t enough to render it topical. Thematic dots are left unjoined, so that we discover “folks are calling them heroes” without properly understanding how or why this might be so. “No wonder we’re who they’ll discuss / Yes this world will remember us,” Clyde sings awkwardly. The show, on the other hand, doesn’t linger long in the mind.

4/20/2022,"Here is a brutal Handmaid’s Tale from our recent European past – but it’s a situation that still exists in many parts of the world, longed for by reactionary nostalgists elsewhere. Happening is the admirable French drama from director and co-writer Audrey Diwan which won the Golden Lion at last year’s Venice film festival; it is an impeccably produced movie, faintly old-fashioned in its vehement emotional message, adapted from an autobiographical novel by Annie Ernaux. The setting is provincial France in 1963, just before the permissive society and the pop culture revolution – and certainly before the legalisation of abortion, which did not happen in France until 1975. Newcomer Anamaria Vartolomei plays Anne Duchesne, a very talented student of literature who in one scene stuns her professor and classmates by knowing what “anaphora” is. Her hardworking mum and dad, Gabrielle and Jacques (played by Sandrine Bonnaire and Eric Verdin) run a bar, and Gabrielle is endlessly proud of her daughter, at one stage giving her some money and saying: “Buy yourself a novel!” But Anne is pregnant. With mounting suppressed panic, she waits for her period and repeatedly writes “rien” in her diary. Her future is about to be destroyed but even asking for an abortion is to risk a jail sentence for you and anyone else who helps – or fails to denounce you. Anne’s escalating dread of the hostile entity within her body reminded me of the mood in Rosemary’s Baby (written and filmed in about the same era). Satan doesn’t have to be the father for a woman to feel horror and shame, and for the male authorities of medicine and law to make it clear she is guilty of a terrible sin, from which the men are mysteriously exempt. Diwan’s movie is cleverly structured so that we do not at first know who the father is, and there is no scene showing the moment of conception. The drama mimics Anne’s own sense of denial, her own refusal to remember or imagine the catastrophe. What we get instead are clinical inspections functioning as chilling parodies or inversions of that sexual intimacy that has upended her life. We see Anne undressing and checking her heart-rendingly pristine underwear for signs of a period; we see her lying half naked and submitting to an examination by the stern male doctor who contemptuously brushes aside Anne’s timid protestations of virginity and delivers the diagnosis. And Vartolomei’s controlled, focused performance shows us Anne’s ordeal, as she carries on as normal while trying to decide what to do: hanging out with her friends, going to lectures, furtively looking at anatomical dictionaries in that pre-web world. She mustn’t tell anyone that she has in fact been catapulted forward into that grim secret future of womanly submission. Happening takes a different line on abortion than a film like, say, Mike Leigh’s Vera Drake from 2004 or Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days from 2007, films that focused with a more ironised chill on the abortionist; this is about the pregnant woman herself. One of the most startling scenes in the film comes when Anne’s flirty (but virginal) roommate Brigitte (Louise Orry-Diquéro) demonstrates to her and their quiet, watchful friend Hélène (Luàna Bajrami) the sexual position she’s heard is the best: she sits astride a pillow and begins to undulate. As Hélène glances with alarm at Anne, Brigitte starts moaning with eyes closed, having apparently forgotten anyone else is there. What is Anne thinking: that Brigitte is naive? Or that this is indeed pleasure, the pleasure that destroyed her life? Perhaps she is thinking that Brigitte doesn’t yet know the price to be paid for this pleasure: or perhaps Anne is envious in her misery, remembering how little pleasure and how little sexual expertise has gone into her own unsentimental education.  Happening is released on 22 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Happening review – cleverly structured and impeccably produced abortion drama,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/20/happening-review-cleverly-structured-and-impeccably-produced-abortion-drama
4/20/2022,"Humphrey Bodington doesn’t remember the collision that led him to give up rugby. He can recall the moments before it, how, playing for Newcastle University, he came hot off the back of the first scrum because he wanted to put in an early shot on the opposition. And he can recall the moments after, the way he woke flat on his back, saw the team’s physio standing over him, and how he thought to himself in that split-second “never again” but nothing in between. He didn’t listen to himself. Two weeks later he played again and suffered another concussion. After that the blackouts and migraines started. Bodington found he could not concentrate in his lectures and that he was especially sensitive to loud noises. He had also injured his anterior cruciate ligament and had to take nine months out of the game to recover. His doctor told him it was a blessing in disguise because it would give his brain time to heal. With his ACL he could see the swelling go down and feel the pain start to go away, but the concussion wasn’t like that. “One of the difficult things is that you always think you have recovered, I always used to think: ‘I’m fine’ and then two weeks later I’d wake up with a headache again and I’d look back and ask: ‘How did I ever think I that?’ The symptoms go on for so long they start to become normalised.” He was doing cognition tests online and for those nine months his scores put him in the bottom 1% of the population. But rugby was everything to him. Bodington started playing when he was seven, went to university on a playing scholarship and planned to go play for a club in the English National League 1 after graduation. So he tried playing again, in the end-of-summer rugby sevens. And he suffered another concussion. This one was different. Bodington wasn’t knocked out, wasn’t even knocked over, but the hit left him suffering with total amnesia about the incident. He walked off the pitch and hasn’t played since. Bodington wants to share his story because he is about to run 14 marathons in seven days along a route that links up 10 rugby and football grounds and then top it off with a weightlifting session. He plans to complete a 200kg squat and a 200kg deadlift, followed by all the runs, in 200 hours. The number comes from a study published in the Lancet in 2018 that showed people who had had at least five traumatic brain injuries were associated with a 200% greater the risk of suffering dementia after they reached the age of 50. He is doing it all to raise money for Head for Change, the charity founded by the former Welsh international Alix Popham and his wife, Mel Bramwell-Popham, to provide support, care and education for players and families suffering with traumatic brain injuries. If you remember Popham from his playing days, read his story or any of the many others the Guardian has covered in recent years and want to help, you can donate here. Bodington read them, too, and says they helped him make the decision to stop playing. He is about to do something utterly extraordinary, but I wanted to tell his story because of the much more ordinary bit that came before he decided to run 14 marathons back-to-back. The decision he made, weighing the risks and rewards of playing the game, is one more and more players are facing. Studies show that participation in rugby union fell by 13.5% in the five years before the pandemic started and it has fallen even more since. The risks of brain injury don’t explain all the drop-off but they do explain part of it. Bodington is 25 now and came up through the grassroots as sport was finally beginning to confront this issue. Through the years he was playing at school, the number of reported concussions more than tripled in English professional rugby. Bodington is from the first generation of players who grew up in an age where it was impossible for the authorities to claim, as they had done in the past, that we didn’t know the extent of the risks involved in the sport. But Bodington’s experiences in the game sound depressingly familiar. He talks about coaches who saw him get knocked out but still told him “carry on and we’ll see how you feel”. How it always felt as though the decision about whether to play on “was in my court”. He talks about a “crack on with it” culture in which players encouraged each other to hide symptoms from their coaches “because otherwise you’ll be off for longer than you want to be” and about how often he was able to kid them into thinking he was fit to play by putting in a big session in the gym on Monday. And he explains how much of this was driven by his own competitive instincts. It was only after Bodington took himself off for a private brain scan that he began to understand what was going on. Since then, he has devoted himself to doing more research. He has launched a start-up that is developing a nutritional supplement to aid recovery and has become evangelical about the benefits of diet and exercise for brain health. He has given himself the education the game should have provided for him. He still gets headaches, still struggles with loud noises. And he still loves the game. “The last thing I would ever recommend is pulling somebody out of the sport,” he says, “especially if they are a boy or girl who absolutely loves it, because it will do so much for them, I don’t want it to go anywhere, I just want it to be safer.”",Sport/Sport,"Blackouts, migraines and amnesia: why a rugby player gave up the game he loved | Andy Bull",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/20/blackouts-migraines-amnesia-why-rugby-union-player-gave-up-game-he-loved
4/20/2022,"You could call them a triple threat. Debbie Kurup, Danielle Steers and Millie O’Connell all play Cher in a new musical about her rise to fame. The Cher Show presents the singer at different points in her career, with versions of her character called Star, Lady and Babe. It opens with Star (Kurup) looking back on her life. “My character draws on the other two to help tell the story,” she explains. The musical unfolds in chronological order with each era given its own distinctive colours, costumes and set. But O’Connell (Babe, the youngest Cher) explains that the three women are often on stage simultaneously. “We all watch each other’s big moments happen. We’re there to egg the other two on,” she says. “I like the analogy that Cher is watching back a VHS of her life,” adds Steers. While she loves “belting out” Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down), it is the times that the trio sing together “that are really magical” says Steers. They single out the goosebump-inducing Song for the Lonely, which they sing in unison at the end of act one. “Lyrically, it is such an uplifting song,” Steers says. “At the end, we repeat the words ‘it’s gonna be alright’ – that is an anthem for everyone,” agrees O’Connell. Cher, Steers argues, is the perfect protagonist for a musical: “She came from nothing, shot to superstardom and then lost everything – multiple times. Aside from a six-decade career, just being a survivor is a good foundation for any story.” Steers vehemently believes that the hits used in The Cher Show are never shoehorned in, as they are in some jukebox musicals. She calls it “reductive” to label The Cher Show as such. “The singing doesn’t feel unnatural. Often, the songs are in context or they come from a place of real feeling.” O’Connell adds: “The scenes are what you’d traditionally see in an intimate, hard-hitting play. We are totally driven by the words and the book written by Rick Elice – and, most importantly, Cher’s life.” O’Connell, 25, admits she didn’t know much at all about Cher’s history before starting rehearsals: “The Cher I knew was a queer icon. As a queer woman, I gravitated towards that part of her.” Steers – who plays the middle Cher, Lady – says it is her uniquely deep voice that has always captivated her: “There aren’t many women out there that have such a rich alto voice.” Steers used to see the singer “as a goddess warrior – which she is – but now I understand her weakness, too”. Kurup explains that her mother grew up listening to Cher and that love was passed down to her. She says: “Like me, Cher comes from mixed-ethnic origin, she faced bullying at school and had to endure racial prejudice. I share her fighting desire to keep moving forward.” The show is directed by Arlene Phillips and choreographed by Oti Mabuse. “Arlene is a very physical director – she’ll jump up, script in hand and sing along with us,” says Steers, who adds that “Oti is a ball of sunshine”. They define the rehearsal process as one of co-creation. “Women creating with women is powerful. This is not society’s norm,” O’Connell says. “We’re dismantling expectation just by being in a room together. And, of course, that is very in the spirit of Cher.” As they prepare to embark on a mammoth UK tour ending this time next year, the trio have some reservations. “It is not the tour itself, but the length of it. I have to just not think about the end date,” Kurup laughs. “I’m a little scared because I’ve not toured before,” adds Steers, but she finds some comfort in the fact that their time on the road is not continuous. “We have a break every three months,” says O’Connell. “I’m excited for the adventure.” Gathered in a back room at their rehearsal studio in Borough, south London, the three Chers look totally relaxed in each other’s company. “Collectively, we do lots of tricks before going on stage to get her voice and sound,” O’Connell laughs. But is there a pressure that comes with playing someone so famous? “Oh yeah, there will be scrutiny,” Kurup says. “But, the only thing we can do is focus on being truthful.” And what does the real Cher make of it all?

4/20/2022,"More than 40,000 railway workers are to be balloted in a dispute over jobs and pay that a union says could result in Britain’s biggest rail strike in modern history. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said staff would be asked to vote on strike action over Network Rail’s plans to cut at least 2,500 maintenance jobs as part of a £2bn reduction in spending on the network. Meanwhile, workers at train operators have been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions. The RMT said the strike ballot was the biggest of members for a single dispute it has undertaken since the union was formed in 1990. The ballot opens on 26 April and closes on 24 May, so strike action could begin in June. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “Railway workers have had to contend with pay freezes, the prospect of losing their jobs and repeated attacks on their terms and conditions. “Removing 2,500 safety-critical jobs from Network Rail will spell disaster for the public, make accidents more likely and will increase the possibility of trains flying off the tracks. “Train operating companies have praised our members for being key workers during the pandemic but have refused to keep staff pay in line with inflation and soaring living costs. As a result, thousands of railway workers have seen their living standards plummet and have run out of patience. “The way for trade unions to effectively take on the cost of living crisis is to stand up for their members at work and take industrial action when employers are not moved by the force of reasoned argument. “A national rail strike will bring the country to a standstill but our members’ livelihoods and passenger safety are our priorities.” The ballot will be among RMT members on Network Rail and the train operators Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, Greater Anglia, LNER, East Midlands Railway, c2c, Great Western Railway, Northern Trains, Southeastern, South Western Railway, Island Line, GTR (including Gatwick Express), TransPennine Express, Avanti West Coast, and West Midlands Trains. Network Rail’s Tim Shoveller said: “Our railway has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and even as passenger numbers start to recover, we know travel habits and passenger demand have changed and the industry has to change, too. “We cannot keep relying on government handouts, and so we must work together with train operators and our trades unions to save millions of pounds and deliver a more efficient railway. “Our modernisation programme aims to build a sustainable future that delivers for passengers and creates better and safer jobs for our people. “We are disappointed that the RMT has taken this decision and urge them again to work with us, not against us, as we build an affordable railway fit for the future.”",News/Business,Threat of biggest rail strike in modern UK history,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/20/threat-of-biggest-rail-strike-in-modern-uk-history
4/20/2022,"Black and ethnic minority people need protecting from unfair searches carried out by officers based on “stereotypes and racial bias”, the police watchdog has said as it highlighted the case of one teenager who was reportedly stopped 60 times, and sometimes more than once a day. The Independent Office for Police Conduct carried out a special review and made 18 recommendations for police across England and Wales to radically reform use of the controversial power. In a hard-hitting report, the IOPC said misuse of stop and search was causing “trauma” and damaging confidence in policing. The watchdog said a review that included studying cases it had investigated made it clear serious problems continued with stop and search despite repeated police promises of reform. It cited cases where innocent black youngsters had been hit and had force used against them, and people being handcuffed within seconds of police stopping them. Stop and search is the continued flashpoint of police and community relations, especially with black people. Home Office figures show that black people are seven times more likely to be stopped across England and Wales, with the vast majority of stops leading to no further action. Stops require reasonable suspicion, and the IOPC criticised the use of weak grounds such as “looking nervous” and unspecific intelligence such as someone being in “a high crime area”. Sal Naseem, from the IOPC, told the Guardian: “In the evidence we have got, we do see examples of racial bias and stereotyping influencing the decisions officers are making.” He added the problems “go beyond a few officers”, and said: “Stop and search is a legitimate tool. It needs to be used with more care and currently is being used too bluntly.” The two most important recommendations from the IOPC are that plans are drawn up to protect communities from the misuse of stop and search. The watchdog said police chiefs and the College of Policing, which sets professional standards, should “develop guidelines on how to safeguard people from a black, Asian or other minority ethnic background from being stopped and searched because of decision-making based upon assumptions, stereotypes and racial bias, and mitigate the risks of indirect discrimination”. The IOPC also said that policing should order research into the “trauma caused predominantly to people from a black, Asian and other minority ethnic background, including children and young people, by the use of stop and search”. The IOPC used its legal powers to carry out the report and policing will have to respond to the calls for root and branch reform. The report cites the example of the child who, when aged 14, was repeatedly searched and says: “… between February 2018 to May 2020, while aged between 14 and 16 years old, he was stopped and searched more than 60 times, sometimes on consecutive days or more than once a day …” The child’s solicitor claimed “the trauma of being intrusively and relentlessly over-policed” and “discriminated against” had a “drastic impact on his wellbeing, life and perception of policing and the justice system”. Stop and search is increasing. Its use rose by 24% to 695,009 in the year ending March 2021, according to Home Office figures, fuelled by increased searches for drugs, which rose by 36% to 478,576 compared with the previous year. Seventy-seven per cent of stops had a recorded outcome of “no further action”. Naseem said handcuffing during stops was used too routinely, needed to change, and the report cited statistics showing a potential racial bias, adding: “Experimental statistics published by the Home Office covering 2019-20 indicate that black people were about 5.7 times more likely to have force used on them than white people across all tactics. Additionally, black people were eight times more likely to be ‘compliant handcuffed’.” The IOPC said officers could see wholly innocent actions as grounds for suspicion and cited the case of a “black child riding a bicycle near to a pedestrian during Covid-19 lockdown restrictions” who was suspected of being involved in a drugs deal. In another case, a black man who wanted to video-record a stop by police was dismissed by the officer as behaving in the way expected of someone with a criminal history and experience of dealing with the police. Amanda Pearson, a deputy assistant commissioner with the Met police who is the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for stop and search, said: “Stop and search, even when done with respect and courtesy, is intrusive and has an impact on people. We recognise that the level of disproportionality in a tactic like stop and search is continuing to damage relations with people from black, Asian and other ethnic minority backgrounds. “It is our responsibility to ensure that we balance tackling crime with building trust and confidence in our communities, and we haven’t always got that balance right with stop and search.”",News/UK news, Police watchdog: ethnic minorities need protection from unfair stop and search,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/20/police-watchdog-ethnic-minorities-need-protection-from-unfair-stop-and-search
4/20/2022,"In the late 1960s, Morton Subotnick’s groundbreaking electronic work Silver Apples of the Moon was both a bestselling classical record and an underground nightclub sensation, since acknowledged as an influence by Frank Zappa and Four Tet alike. But back in 1958, the very first big public presentation of his work did not go quite so smoothly. He’d written a piece for two people playing a single piano and Subotnick was convinced it was “really fresh”. The audience less so. By the third movement they were already growing restless. The players on stage practically had to stare them down. At the end, the crowd rose in a fury, screaming at the stage. The pianists ran for their lives. Subotnick had just graduated from Mills College in Oakland, California, and his former lecturer, the exiled French composer Darius Milhaud, had helped to arrange the concert. Feeling sick to his stomach, Subotnick spies Milhaud in his seat with tears in his eyes and apologises for what he presumes to be his teacher’s disappointment. “No, my dear,” Milhaud reassures him. “Those are tears of joy. It reminds me of the old days.” Originally founded as the Young Ladies Seminary in 1852, the liberal arts institution had once been home to innovation, experimentation, and sly subversion. And it has been since, nurturing some of the US’s most daring musicians: Steve Reich, Laurie Anderson, Holly Herndon and the Grateful Dead’s Phil Lesh are among the alumni; John Cage, Terry Riley and – the screams having subsided – Subotnick among the faculty. But that legacy is under threat: in March last year, the college announced that due to “declining enrolment and budget deficits”, it would cease to enrol new students. Since then, a possible reprieve has come in the shape of a proposed merger with the much larger Northeastern University in Boston, but Mills’ future remains uncertain. The current chair of music, David Bernstein, tells me that he is “trying to talk to the right people … But it’s a steep climb. We’ll have to see.” In the meantime, Bernstein is putting together four days of concerts this week entitled Music in the Fault Zone to celebrate the college’s radical history, featuring music by everyone from current faculty members such as Zeena Parkins and Maggi Payne, back through notable emeriti such as Subotnick, Milhaud, Cage and Roscoe Mitchell. “It seemed to be a good time to raise awareness of what’s going on at Mills,” says Bernstein. “And the best way is with the music.” It was the autumn of 1940 when Cage first started canvassing for the establishment of a centre for experimental music at Mills. Hired as an accompanist in the college’s dance department earlier that year, the 28-year-old composer wrote to everyone from famed conductor Leopold Stokowski to Walt Disney in order to drum up support for a new kind of music studio “in which there are no obligations or prohibitions, in which nothing is even predictable”. But despite enthusiasm on the part of the college, led at that time by the visionary peace and women’s rights activist Aurelia Henry Reinhardt, Cage’s appeals would ultimately come to naught. At least at first. Almost a quarter century later in 1962, and across the bay from Mills, Subotnick founded the San Francisco Tape Music Center with Pauline Oliveros and fellow Mills alum Ramon Sender, and it became an important hub for countercultural music. Avant garde works for coloured lights and tropical fish were played to audiences sprawled on beanbags; it hosted the premiere of Terry Riley’s landmark minimalist work In C; the Center’s three-day long Trips festival was a great hippy jamboree which saw thousands of tabs of LSD distributed to a DayGlo-painted crowd dancing to the Grateful Dead. It was also where California native Donald Buchla developed one of the world’s first modular synthesisers, a pioneering electronic instrument which would bring a futuristic swirl of sound to new age meditation tapes and Coke ads alike. Beset by financial problems, however, the Center’s founders applied to The Rockefeller Foundation to keep the wolf from the door. The application was successful, but it came with a proviso: that a “responsible fiscal agent” come in as a partner. Hence a move to Mills in 1966, with Oliveros as the first director. “Mills was very slow in deciding whether I should stay or not,” Oliveros (who died in 2016) told me a decade ago, and she soon left for another university. Bernstein sees those early days as inauspicious, Mills rubbing uneasily against the “alternative essence of the Tape Center”, but that all changed with the arrival of Robert Ashley. A debonair midwesterner with a penchant for silk scarves whose half-spoken “TV operas” of the 70s and 80s would transform the genre, Ashley brought a new spirit. Composer , who took her MFA there in 1970 before joining the faculty a year later, fondly recalls the “wonderful camaraderie” that Ashley insisted upon. “He was always intent on developing a sense of community,” she says. “It was all about personal responsibility and collaboration – both within and across disciplines.” That sensibility has persisted long after Ashley’s departure in 1981 – Roscoe Mitchell of the jazz unit Art Ensemble of Chicago, who joined the Mills faculty in 2007, sees Ashley as a “giant influence” – but Ashley was not always the most orthodox of educators. Acclaimed composer Sarah Davachi, a more recent graduate, was told by one of her teachers at Mills “that public speaking made Ashley very anxious, so before he taught a class he would go out on to the balcony of the Moog studio and get high to calm himself down”. Roscoe Mitchell’s own tenure came amid increasing financial difficulty and tension: an attempt to oust him was met with a huge public outcry and he was finally reinstated, only to resign his post a year later. “I was ready to go after that,” Mitchell tells me. “It felt almost like being a rat on a sinking ship or something.” Today, Mills is even more precarious. “There are so many unknowns,” Payne says, but she hopes they’ll be able to “continue with what the whole idea has been all these years: experimentation and collaboration. At a lot of schools, if you don’t compose in the manner that the professor is composing in then you might be in trouble. But at Mills, if you do try to mimic us, then you’re in trouble. It’s got to come from you.” Davachi thinks back to her lecturer Alvin Lucier, who made cornerstones of American avant garde composition such as I Am Sitting in a Room, and who gave her “the greatest compliment I have ever received”. She was lugging two pairs of huge speaker cabinets to her car and Lucier, she recalls, “was sitting there, wrapped in a blanket,” waiting to deliver a lecture. As the loudspeakers strained in her arms, she quickly explained her project, a piece for pipe organ and electronics requiring mathematically tuned notes in between the pitches of a piano keyboard. “Wow,” Lucier responded just like Milhaud before him, “that sounds just like what we used to do in the old days.” Hopefully there will be a future generation for Davachi to be amazed by, too.

4/20/2022,"Joe Anderson, the former mayor of Liverpool, has been told he is no longer under investigation by Lancashire police. Anderson was interviewed under caution towards the end of 2017 as part of Operation Sheridan, an investigation launched in 2013 after financial irregularity concerns were raised over the awarding of a fleet maintenance contract. A separate investigation by Merseyside police into allegations of bribery and witness intimidation is ongoing. Over the weekend, Anderson tweeted that Lancashire police had “discontinued” their interest in him and would be taking no action. The force said it had written to four men and informed them they were no longer under investigation as part of Operation Sheridan. “The four, aged 64, 68, 66 and 62, were contacted last month and told they would face no further action,” it said. “Operation Sheridan was launched in 2013 following allegations of financial irregularity made to the constabulary by Lancashire county council. On completion of the investigation, we referred the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service, who are currently considering potential offences in relation to four other individuals. “We would like to remind all concerned that criminal proceedings in this matter remain active. It is extremely important there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice any future proceedings.” Anderson, 64, was first elected as a Liverpool city councillor in 1998, becoming leader in 2010. He became Liverpool’s first directly elected mayor in 2012, and had been reselected as Labour’s candidate to fight the local election in May 2021, a vote that was postponed from 2020 because of Covid. He was arrested by Merseyside police in December 2020 as part of a different inquiry, Operation Aloft, investigating allegations of bribery and witness intimidation linked to building deals in Liverpool. That investigation is ongoing. His arrest led to Anderson stepping aside as mayor and announcing he would not be seeking re-election. At the time he said the police investigation would “confirm I have done nothing wrong, and my name and reputation will be exonerated”. Anderson said he would continue to fight to prove his innocence and to protect his legacy as mayor of his home city. He wrote: “It has been a great privilege to represent the Labour party and be part of a collective movement that represents people like me growing up in, and trying to find a way out of, poverty.”",News/UK news,Ex-Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson no longer under investigation by Lancashire police,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/20/ex-liverpool-mayor-joe-anderson-nvestigation-police-lancashire
4/20/2022,"Claire O’Byrne has been living at the sharp end of Scotland’s rural housing crisis. Owing to a chronic housing shortage on Arran, she had to declare herself homeless and leave the island, and for now gambles on its ailing ferry service for visits to the island with her five-year-old daughter, Alice. “Arran is an afterthought for everybody in terms of infrastructure and services,” she said. “It’s a nightmare. I have known so many people who have had to make a decision to move away.” Arran is “one of the most beautiful of places,” O’Byrne said. But for her and her daughter’s father, Michael Dixon, even the most basic things are a struggle. With house prices forced up by well-off retirees snapping up coastal bungalows and buy-to-let landlords earning fortunes from holidaymakers, homes are unaffordable, insecure or unavailable for many islanders. O’Byrne tried living in a caravan and a friend’s spare room, and then was unable to find childcare for Alice, costing her a job. On Sunday, engine failure on Arran’s largest car ferry, the MV Caledonian, which links the island to Ardrossan on the mainland, caused the latest instance of what are repeated ferry delays and service cancellations. On Tuesday, holidaymakers booked on the Caledonian were advised by the ferry’s operator, CalMac, to drive 125 miles to use an alternative car ferry from Kintyre. That brought into sharp relief the impact of a badly botched Scottish government contract to build a new, more reliable ferry to replace the Caledonian. Massively over budget and four years late, the vessel lies part-finished in Ferguson’s shipyard up the Clyde coast in Port Glasgow. It may be in service next year. These issues are uppermost in O’Byrne and Dixon’s thoughts as they approach the Scottish council elections on 5 May, when all 32 of Scotland’s local authorities are in play. Dixon owns a pizza and ice-cream shop in Brodick, Arran’s main town, but has also struggled to find housing. “It all boils down to the same thing: better infrastructure for the islands, and a better transport system, 100%,” he said. The election in North Ayrshire will be a significant test for Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish National party and for Scottish Labour, which appears to be enjoying a renaissance under Anas Sarwar’s leadership. Opinion polls show Labour has replaced the Scottish Conservatives in second place behind the still dominant SNP, with Sarwar’s party benefiting from hostility among unionist voters to Boris Johnson and Labour’s increased popularity at UK level. The Liberal Democrats are also benefiting from Tory desertions, Alex Cole Hamilton, the party’s Scottish leader, said last week. Cole Hamilton said voter anger over the Partygate scandals was the most intense he had ever encountered. “This is political strychnine for the Tory party,” he said. North Ayrshire has been run since 2017 by a minority Labour administration. The election will be a contest between Sturgeon’s heavy focus at national level on anti-poverty measures and health service investment, and Labour’s local record. Joe Cullinane, North Ayrshire’s leader and a Labour councillor, believes the ferry crisis has raised questions about Sturgeon’s economic competence, but Labour’s local manifesto emphasises its performance in power: a promise to build three solar farms; a programme to build 1,625 new council houses; retrofitting 5,600 council houses with solar panels; a community bank; and becoming the first council to introduce free period products and mental health counsellors in schools. “We’re doing things differently in North Ayrshire,” he said. Voter turnout remains uncertain but he believes questions about the SNP’s competence, the Tories’ fitness for office in Westminster and his council’s policies are resonating with voters. “[Those issues] are coming together and giving us a better response on the door than we’ve had for a number of years,” he said. Marie Burns, the SNP group leader, acknowledged the ferries crisis would be an issue for some voters in Ardrossan and on Arran. “The whole thing has been a bit of a disaster,” she said. “I can understand people’s frustrations and I wouldn’t take away from that.” Even so, Burns argues the broader cost of living crisis matters more. That has dominated conversations with voters at the SNP’s hub in Irvine, a converted shop on high street that was a base for yes campaigners in the 2014 referendum. “They say they’re really struggling,” she said. “It’s food, energy, how their shopping bills have gone up, and they’re really worried about how they’ll heat their homes.” Burns points to Sturgeon’s decision to double child benefits for low-income families in Scotland to £20 a week, partly driven by pressure from opposition parties and anti-poverty campaigners. That will benefit 4,000 families in North Ayrshire. “That’s what the SNP is doing for you,” she said. While Labour may well hold North Ayrshire, it is unlikely to unseat the SNP minority administration in Glasgow or take Edinburgh, where the SNP shares power with Labour. Sarwar’s aides argue the major test for Labour is increasing its vote share, which fell by 11 points to 20% in 2017, and its overall number of councillors, from the 262 won in 2017. Labour gains on 5 May should signal a far more significant recovery in time for the next UK general election. Scotland’s system of electing councillors by proportional representation means it is rare for a single party to win outright; it leads to coalitions or minority administrations. Sarwar has ruled out Labour deals with other parties. He hopes to see Labour council leaders emulate Cullinane in running a minority administration. O’Byrne, an Australian who moved to Arran in 2015, is one voter who has benefited from North Ayrshire’s housebuilding strategy. She has been allocated a two-bedroom house in a new council-owned estate in Brodick, allowing her to return home in a few months. Michelle Bunting, the deputy headteacher at Arran high school, agreed that the ferries were “a nightmare” but she believes voters will focus far more on basic services that the council directly controls: affordable housing, support for people with special needs, and economic regeneration. “Housing, particularly for young folk who may want to stay in the islands or come back but they just can’t afford to do it,” she said.",News/Politics,Housing crisis and ferries ‘nightmare’ in focus in North Ayrshire elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/housing-crisis-and-ferries-nightmare-in-focus-in-north-ayrshire-elections
4/20/2022,"Australia’s political leaders have traded barbs over China’s security agreement with Solomon Islands, with Anthony Albanese labelling it a “Pacific stuff-up” and Scott Morrison accusing him of siding with China. In an evenly matched outing in the first leaders’ debate on Wednesday, the prime minister focused on handling of the economy while Albanese accused the government of “treading water” and “not pursuing any significant economic, social or environmental reforms”. The debate marks a turning point in the six-week campaign, as Labor prepares to launch its negative ads against Morrison, which will focus on the prime minister’s refusal to take responsibility and feature footage of him saying “that’s not my job”. On Wednesday evening Albanese argued that the Morrison government “haven’t learned from their mistakes, they keep repeating them” and promised that, if elected, he will “accept responsibility” and “not always seek to blame someone else”. Facing the Sky News town hall of undecided voters, Morrison credited Labor for “great” reforms like the national disability insurance scheme but claimed the Coalition is needed to pay for them. At one point Morrison suggested to a woman, Catherine, whose autistic son, Ethan’s, NDIS package had been cut that he had been “blessed” with two children who “haven’t had to go through that”. Morrison added the explanation that was why he “can only try and understand your aspirations for those children”. The answer drew a sharp social media rebuke from the former opposition leader and NDIS architect Bill Shorten: ScoMo says he is “blessed” to have two non disabled children. Every child is a blessing. The NDIS is there to help people with disability live their lives to the fullest. The Morrison Gov has slashed NDIS plans for 1000s of children around Australia. Labor will fix the NDIS. Albanese said the example of the 30% cut to Ethan’s care package was “not isolated” and described the NDIS as a “proud Labor reform”, arguing that it is “always Labor” that makes “changes that make a difference to people’s lives”. Labor enters the final month of the federal election campaign with an edge in the opinion polls but the Coalition is buoyed by Morrison’s campaigning skills and an early stumble by Albanese over economic figures. Both leaders put the difficulties of the first week behind them, with no gotchas on economic figures or questions over divisions in the Liberal party over the controversial Warringah candidate, Katherine Deves. The most heated exchange of the evening came when discussing China’s security deal with Solomon Islands. Morrison rejected Labor’s charge that this was “a policy failure”, claiming “no, this is happening because China is seeking to interfere in the Pacific”. “It’s odd that the Labor party … wouldn’t say ‘no it isn’t because China is coming to interfere in our region’, somehow, it’s Australia’s fault. “What I don’t understand is that when something of this significance takes place, why would you take China’s side?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese said national security should not be the subject of an “outrageous slur” like that. Despite China’s more forceful posture, Australia is “not really stepping up”, he said. “This isn’t so much a Pacific step-up. It’s a Pacific stuff-up. This is a major foreign policy failure by Australia.” Albanese was voted the winner of the debate, with the Labor leader convincing 40% of the 100 undecided voters at the event. The prime minister received 35%, while 25% of attendees remained undecided. Earlier, Morrison moved to defuse an emerging Labor campaign that the Coalition’s bid to revisit its industrial relations reforms would neuter the better off overall test and result in pay cuts, committing that this element of the bill was “not part of our forward agenda”. “We said we would only go forward with the measures that weren’t emergency pandemic measures,” he said, cleaning up days of doubt over whether a commitment to bring the bill back would include its most contentious element. Both leaders refused to resile from scare campaigns suggesting the Coalition may force aged pensioners onto the cashless debit card and that Labor’s asylum seeker policies may restart boats. Morrison ruled out putting pensioners on the card, but defended the tool used to help “people in vulnerable situations … manage their income better”. Morrison sought to wrong-foot Albanese over asylum seeker policy, querying why as deputy prime minister in 2013 Albanese had supported offshore detention but not boat turn-backs. Albanese countered that Morrison was “always looking for division” and Labor supported the turn-back policy now. Morrison sought to undercut the viability of Labor’s proposed reforms in the aged care sector, arguing the government “can’t make nurses fall out of the sky” to meet a standard of nurses present 24/7. He said that setting that standard, even with the best of intentions, would result in aged care facilities in rural and regional areas closing.

Morrison defended the government’s proposed integrity commission model, despite earlier in the campaign abandoning any commitment to legislate it in the next parliament unless Labor supports it. Faced with a voter question about restoring trust in the democratic process, Morrison delivered a stump speech about the economy. Morrison concluded the debate by framing the election “as a choice” that would determine Australians’ “economic opportunity, jobs, wages and the services that Australia can afford to deliver”.",News/Australia news,Morrison and Albanese clash on Solomon Islands-China pact in first leaders’ debate of federal election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/morrison-and-albanese-clash-on-solomon-islands-china-pact-at-first-leaders-debate-of-federal-election
4/20/2022,"Manchester United’s chief scout will leave in the close season and the club’s global head of scouting has gone in moves that may allow an overhaul of recruitment when the expected appointment of Erik ten Hag as the new manager occurs. Jim Lawlor, the chief scout, joined United in 2006 under Sir Alex Ferguson, and Marcel Bout was part of Louis van Gaal’s coaching staff before becoming global head of scouting in 2016. A United spokesperson said: “Jim Lawlor has decided to step down from his role as chief scout in the summer after 16 years with the club. During that time, Jim played a key role in the development of multiple trophy-winning Manchester United teams and was an important source of guidance to Sir Alex Ferguson and each of the managers who have followed him. Jim leaves the club with our warmest thanks for his significant contribution and our very best wishes for the future. “Marcel Bout has departed from his role as head of global scouting after eight years with the club. Marcel has played an important part as an assistant coach and in the strengthening of our scouting capabilities in recent years.” Ten Hag is closing on being appointed as United’s fifth permanent manager in nine years. A key requirement from the Ajax coach is that he should have control of transfer policy with the executive. Jesse Lingard has apologised to United’s fans for Tuesday’s 4-0 defeat at Liverpool and called on the squad to increase the intensity levels in training before Saturday’s game at Arsenal. “It’s horrible,” he told MUTV of the loss. “It’s horrible for the fans.

4/20/2022,"In the aftermath of genocide, Rwanda turned to tradition to help rebuild the country. There is a saying: turi bene mugabo umwe Gihanga – we all have the same father. Hospitality is part and parcel of this custom, a natural reflex of living together rather than an obligation. Sasa bugari, another saying goes, or widen your bed and always make room for the unknown traveller who may seek hospitality at any time. In the shack where we landed after being exiled, my mother immediately set about weaving two mats for any unexpected guests who may drop in, certain of a warm welcome. My father, too, would be up at cock’s crow, before dawn, and off into the savannah in search of more fertile earth on which to grow the next crop. Come nightfall, seeing smoke above a banana plantation, he knew he could simply lay down his staff outside a hut and call out “Yemwe abaha” (hey folks) to be received with all the respect and discretion that was due to a traveller. Early the next day he would set off again, secure in the knowledge that when the sun set behind the hills a woman somewhere would have prepared a welcome mat for the passing traveller. As Rwanda rises again from the ashes of the genocide against the Tutsi, many of those now governing the country endured exile, just as I did. There must have been Rwandan refugees almost all over the world. So how can we disregard all those who are suffering the same lot? We too have a long experience of exile. We cannot forget the misery we endured, so it seems only human nature to reach out to those who are now in the same situation. In taking in refugees and asylum seekers who are otherwise bound for Britain, is Rwanda looking for some form of reparation? Is rescuing others from exile a way of proving to itself that its own exile is over? Will welcoming outcasts help heal its own wounds? Rwanda has so far accommodated 130,000 refugees, mostly from neighbouring countries – the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi – but also Libyan evacuees and even a class from a girls’ secondary school in Afghanistan. The country is also versed in international cooperation under the aegis of the United Nations. International bodies have called in its army, reputed for its effectiveness and discipline, to serve in Darfur, Central African Republic and Mozambique. But the same organisations are in some doubt about the plan hatched by Britain and Rwanda. I followed the speech by Vincent Biruta, Rwanda’s minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation. Why, he asked, shouldn’t we try to relieve suffering? Perhaps we should also see this move as an attempt by Rwanda to show that African countries, repeatedly dismissed as among the world’s poorest, can in fact do their bit for migrants and even provide assistance to one of the world’s most prosperous nations. By some strange irony of history, Rwanda will, in June, be hosting the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, a relic of a defunct empire. I am not only a Rwandan writer, but also a social worker. In my work, I have heard what migrants have to say on the subject. Where I live in France, near to the port of Ouistreham on the Normandy coast, ferries depart daily for Portsmouth. Migrants hang around here in the faint hope of getting on board. Recently, I was guided through the port by Laetitia Jeanne, a young volunteer who helps migrants, day after day, with the endless hassles they face. Their responses (I have changed their names) differ depending on which continent they come from. African youths tend to think highly of Rwanda, with its image as a startup nation open to all forms of initiative. This view is borne out by African students I’ve met. So, as some will say, why not Rwanda? Ibrahim, from Sudan, told me that if he had to choose between Sudan and Rwanda, he’d opt for the latter. “But I object to people being forced to go to Rwanda instead of the country they choose, risking their lives in the process. We also need to be sure of the guarantees for those who agree to go there. Many people might prefer that option to risking their lives at sea.” The Afghan migrants I spoke with did not see things this way at all, convinced that the partnership is a trap, a roundabout way of sending them back home. “What are we going to do in this impoverished country?” they asked. In England they have reached the end of their journey. Ali, from Afghanistan, told me he thought Britain’s plan was “contrary to the right of asylum”. “An asylum seeker is someone who gives up one life and decides to go to another country to start a new life. Now they’re going to be deported to another country where they don’t want to live. Of course, in abstract terms, the idea of asylum is to look for a safe place and Rwanda is safe now, but it’s not somewhere to make your dreams come true.” Ahmed, who was also from Afghanistan, told me that a friend recently called him from England. “Lots of people have gone into hiding [there] rather than go to Rwanda. They’re 100% certain their application for asylum will be rejected and they’ll have to go back to Afghanistan. They can’t understand why this country [has been chosen]. There’s nothing nearby. It’s a miserable place. They didn’t go to all this trouble to make a life exiled in a country they didn’t choose.” So will people like Ibraham, Ali and Ahmed be given a choice? They too should have a say over their futures. Scholastique Mukasonga is a French Rwandan novelist and author of Our Lady of the Nile and The Barefoot Woman.
