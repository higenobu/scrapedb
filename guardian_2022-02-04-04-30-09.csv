2/4/2022,"It has been clear since at least last autumn that, come April, soaring global energy prices would crash at high speed into the ability of millions of British households to pay their heating bills. Acknowledging this as “the number one issue on people’s minds”, Rishi Sunak went to the Commons on Thursday and unveiled a raft of measures designed to limit the inevitable but still widely underestimated damage. Conservative MPs praised the chancellor’s package. Opposition MPs condemned it as not going far enough. But the larger truth, two months before consumers start to experience the impact of Thursday’s dramatic rise in the energy price cap, is that, while the issue may be on people’s minds, the real human and political shock from these price rises will start in April.  When it comes, and despite the chancellor’s measures, that impact will be very great for very many. Mr Sunak described it in his evening press conference as drawing the sting – but stings can leave serious wounds. It may also last longer than the Treasury hopes. Even as things stand, the figures are eye-watering. Rocketing world prices in late 2021 will result in the biggest hit to the cost of living for the majority of British households in at least a quarter of a century. On Thursday, the energy regulator, Ofgem, confirmed that the average bill will rise from £1,277 now to £1,971 after 1 April, a hike of 54%. Four-fifths of that is the result of the rise in wholesale prices, up by 104%. Britain’s dependence on gas, which heats 85% of our often poorly insulated homes, makes this country a sitting duck. With national insurance rises also due to take effect at the same time, inflation moving steadily upwards again (the Bank of England raised interest rates while the chancellor was on his feet) and prices continuing to outdistance wages (partly because of energy costs), Mr Sunak will be praying for warm spring weather to take the chill off the bills. The chancellor’s measures will undoubtedly absorb some of the shock. All domestic customers will receive a £200 government-financed discount from October, but they will then pay it back in five annual instalments. English households in the lowest four council tax bands – some 80% of the total – will also get a £150 rebate. Local authorities will get discretionary funding to help them target other vulnerable and low-income households. The devolved nations will receive equivalent support under the Barnett formula. None of this can disguise that most households will still be hit extremely hard from April. Energy prices are high even now, and record numbers are already facing unacceptable choices between heating, eating and other forms of household expenditure. All this is before any of the new price increases kick in. The chancellor’s measures may help, but things will still get worse not better for most. Shell’s announcement of quadrupled profits on Thursday makes Mr Sunak’s talk of the government taking action to share the burden seem insulting. Mr Sunak’s measures are also fragile. The Treasury is gambling that global wholesale gas prices will start coming down next year. Looking at the graph of wholesale prices, many will see the thinking. But analysts are already predicting that the price cap will have to be raised again after the next half-yearly review. That will mean even higher prices for consumers (along with, presumably, fresh and costly Treasury mitigations) just as the weather turns colder again. The most important aspect of the energy price rises will be their human effect on the poorest and least well-off. They have not been adequately supported. But don’t forget the politics of this too. Some of Mr Johnson’s MPs have put him on probation until the May local elections. The combined effect of energy price hikes, higher taxes and continuing inflation means that, for him, April may indeed be the cruellest month.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on energy price rises: April is the cruellest month | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/03/the-guardian-view-on-energy-price-rises-april-is-the-cruellest-month
2/4/2022,"Two days after the Grenfell Tower fire the UK government mounted a rebuttal operation to counter potentially damaging reports that building regulations had allowed the use of combustible cladding, the public inquiry has heard. As families searched frantically for missing loved ones, Brian Martin, the official in charge of fire safety building regulations at the ministry of housing, local government and communities, circulated a pre-written rebuttal of press claims that the plastic-filled panels that fuelled the inferno were in fact allowed in the UK but not abroad.  Martin contacted Diane Marshall, operations director at the National House Building Council (NHBC), which provided building control services, asking her to “say this (or something similar) in public” to counter critical reporting that the government’s building control system had allowed the west London council block to be wrapped in combustible materials. The contractors and designers of Grenfell’s disastrous refurbishment have claimed they believed the works met fire safety regulations and the works were signed off by building control officials at the borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The rules were beset by ambiguity but the inquiry has already found the scheme as built at Grenfell using aluminium composite material (ACM) panels with a polyethylene (PE) core failed to comply. Ministers and government officials are facing cross-examination over their role in the lead up to the fire including the “bonfire of red tape” policy of David Cameron’s government and the failure to review fire safety rules after the fatal 2009 Lakanal House high-rise fire in south London. On 16 June 2017, Martin emailed Marshall: “Apologies in advance for asking, but I’ve been asked to prepare a rebuttal of the assertion that PE cored ACM panels comply with the guidance in ADB [approved document B guidance to the building regulations]. I’ve also been asked if an independent expert would be willing to say this [or something similar] in public? Can you consider the attached and let me know.” Marshall said she wasn’t surprised to receive this but, asked by counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC if it was appropriate that the government approached her with a “pre-prepared script in support of government” after the fire, she said “it was unusual”. Attached was a summary of an article in the Times newspaper that asserted Grenfell’s cladding panels “conform to UK standards but are prohibited in other countries”. The lines suggested were “we would dispute the assertion that a polyethylene core panel is acceptable for use under current building regulations” and that guidance states that the external envelope of a building should not provide a medium for fire spread”. The script suggested saying “unmodified polyethylene would not meet the definition of ‘limited combustibility’… As such it should not be used as a cladding material on buildings over 18m in height”. Marshall responded suggesting NHBC might not seem sufficiently independent. Asked whether the script was consistent with the government’s previous approach to allowing use of ACM panels she said “the definition of filler was open to interpretation”. The inquiry continues.",News/UK news,Housing ministry started rebuttal operation two days after Grenfell fire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/housing-ministry-started-rebuttal-operation-two-days-after-grenfell-fire
2/4/2022,"The departure of Munira Mirza, Downing Street’s head of policy, suggests that time is running out for Boris Johnson’s government. Sliding in opinion polls and under investigation by the police over illegal lockdown parties in No 10, the administration has a fin de régime aura. Ms Mirza, reputed to be the prime minister’s most trusted and influential aide, said that she was quitting over a matter of principle – a rare thing in Mr Johnson’s shrinking circle. She was unwilling to stay silent over his scurrilous slur against Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. After working with Mr Johnson for 14 years, Ms Mirza must have been acquainted with his modus operandi. But his claim that Sir Keir spent “more time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile” from the dispatch box was a smear too far. Sir Keir had been director of public prosecutions when Savile was questioned under caution by police in 2009. But he was not involved in the decision not to pursue the case and there is nothing to suggest he knew that Savile was a serial sexual abuser and failed to prosecute him. A day after Mr Johnson’s deplorable attack, he was rebuked by the Commons Speaker, but refused to backtrack.  This appears to have been the final straw for Ms Mirza. Her resignation letter reveals that she understood the damage that peddling such conspiracy theories could do, even when her boss did not. Ms Mirza wrote that “this was not the usual cut and thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse”. She called on Mr Johnson to apologise: “I appreciate that our political culture is not forgiving when people say sorry, but regardless, it is the right thing to do.” This plea went unanswered. During a visit to Blackpool, Mr Johnson claimed that his comments were about Sir Keir’s “responsibility for the [CPS] as a whole”. This is a justification, not an apology. The prime minister is constitutionally incapable of expressing remorse for what he has done wrong. The deliberate and intentional misleading of fellow lawmakers and the public is a serious matter. Parliamentary privilege confers immunity in respect of what MPs say. It can be a valuable tool. It is not an excuse for lying in parliament. Mr Johnson rose to the top by flouting such conventions, but his way of shaping taunts has come back to haunt him. While others were unable to see dying parents, he attended parties, then claimed shock that they were social events. The pain-free Brexit he promised cannot be delivered. Britain won’t be levelled up anytime soon. Tellingly, Downing Street’s press chief also left on Thursday. As Tory MPs continue to pen letters demanding that the prime minister goes, these departures are evidence that he is running out of people to betray.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on a Downing Street resignation: a smear too far | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/03/the-guardian-view-on-a-downing-street-resignation-a-smear-too-far
2/4/2022,"For the last umpteen years Ofgem has offered parental-sounding advice when adjusting the energy price cap. “Switch to save money,” the regulator trumpeted last February as the maximum rate was raised by £96. Even last autumn, when £139 was added, Ofgem was still saying customers “can avoid the increase by shopping around”. There’s no escape now. As the thumping £693 hike from April landed on Thursday, the regulator merely offered a limp line about how it knows it’s all “extremely worrying for many people”. It, like everybody else, knows there aren’t better deals to switch to. Competition has disappeared. The price cap has become the floor rate, not the ceiling. Roughly 80% of households are on it – the main exceptions being those who had the luck or foresight to secure a fixed rate before wholesale gas prices quadrupled.  To put it mildly, the energy supply market looks nothing like the one Ofgem has spent a couple of decades trying to encourage. Some 29 suppliers – half the tally last June – have gone bust and the high corporate casualty rate cannot be pinned solely on the “unprecedented” (the regulator’s favourite word) spike in gas prices. At least part of the blame falls on a rotten regulatory system that allowed undercapitalised companies to try their luck by operating with skimpy hedging policies on energy-purchase contracts. Ofgem had a go at tightening licence rules a couple of years ago, but merely tweaked. The admission by the chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, in December that a proper version of “financial resilience” is required arrived extremely late in the day. Some £68 of the £693 increase in the cap, note, relates to industry-wide “supplier of last resort” levies – in other words, the cost of moving customers of failed companies to new suppliers. That’s £1.5bn in real money. Nor does the figure include anything for Bulb, which was quasi-nationalised last year. The bill for Bulb has been deferred for another day. Meanwhile, the corporate survivors look sickly. All, with the possible exception of Centrica’s British Gas, are assumed to be making losses (the money in this crisis is being made by energy producers and traders). Few tears may be shed for their shareholders, but the policy point is that the government and Ofgem are relying on the same firms to double up as service organisations on the way to net zero by selling us heat pumps, electric boilers and the rest. At the moment, they’re limping from one price cap announcement to the next. Little long-term investment or innovation will be happening. Yes, the surge in gas prices is the prime driver of this crisis, no question. Even if Ofgem had policed its beat aggressively, financial pain for customers would be unavoidable. The chancellor would still be intervening, just as most of his EU counterparts are doing. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that both regulator and government sleepwalked into events and, even now, are placing huge faith in the idea that wholesale prices will fall and then stabilise. Rishi Sunak’s support package for customers seems to have been constructed at the eleventh-hour with little consultation with companies on how the £200-per-household rebates will be administered. If the price cap rises again in October – and another £250 is the consensus forecast – will more loans and rebates be made available? As for Ofgem’s pro-resilience reforms, they’re still a work in progress. The price cap is being made more flexible, which is an easy and obvious reform, but stress-tests on corporate balance sheets and hedging policies are only taking place now. Ofgem’s visibility over the strains in the system is improving by the week, which is the good news, but it has yet to emerge as the pro-intervention regulator it should have been all along. Meanwhile, the big fear in the background is another stage to the price surges in wholesale gas markets. The obvious candidate is a Russian invasion into Ukraine, which could conceivably make Thursday’s measures look inadequate at a stroke. Even a rapid plunge in prices isn’t a trouble-free outcome either: a lot of hedging contracts would have to be unwound in a hurry. One assumes a vaguely functioning energy market, complete with switching, will return eventually, but this crisis cannot be declared to be over. Sunak’s political fix, inadequate already, may be exposed as short-term in short order; and the regulatory approach is being remodelled in a rush. “Extremely worrying” doesn’t quite capture it.",News/Business,Government and Ofgem have sleepwalked into this energy crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/government-ofgem-sleepwalked-energy-crisis-prices
2/4/2022,"Chris Silverwood has been sacked following England’s disastrous Ashes campaign, with the head coach departing after team director Ashley Giles was dismissed on Wednesday.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has removed Silverwood after reviewing recommendations from a panel that included Andrew Strauss, who has taken over from Giles on an interim basis, and the governing body’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, following the 4-0 series defeat. Strauss will now appoint an interim coach to lead the upcoming tour of the West Indies.  “During his time in the role Chris has given absolutely everything to make a success of it,” Harrison said in the ECB’s statement. “He is a man of great integrity, who players and staff alike have enjoyed working with. Under Chris, England men’s white ball teams have been ranked first and second in the world while he also led the Test team to a number of series wins, including away in South Africa and Sri Lanka.” “He has led the England men’s team with great resilience and empathy through an incredibly challenging period for English cricket, and he deserves our sincere thanks and gratitude,” Harrison added. “In the coming days, Andrew Strauss will appoint a caretaker coach for the tour of the West Indies and will then consider the appropriate coaching structures to help England move forwards.” Giles met the ECB’s board of directors on Wednesday morning and was told his three-year spell in charge of the national team was terminated. Both men have paid the price for Test results that produced only one win from the team’s past 14 outings and ended with the failure in Australia. “It’s been an absolute honour to be England head coach, and I’m extremely proud to have worked alongside our players and staff,” Silverwood said. “I want to thank them all for the hard work and commitment they have given during my time in the role and I wish them all the very best moving forward.” “The last two years have been very demanding but I have really enjoyed my time with the team and working with Rooty and Morgs, and I am very proud of this group considering the challenges. I leave with fond memories and I am now looking forward to spending some quality time at home with my family and embracing the next chapter.” Silverwood insisted he was “the right man for the job” on multiple occasions as England’s attempt to regain the Ashes floundered within 12 days and they subsequently concluded their third consecutive tour Down Under without winning a Test. Amid batting travails, questionable selections and tactical errors, Giles had publicly sought to blame exhausting scheduling and Covid bubbles for the poor performances. But following the panel’s review, and with a Test squad needing to be picked for the forthcoming tour of the Caribbean next week, the end has come swiftly on Silverwood’s two-year tenure. The ECB has yet to announce whether Silverwood’s assistant and batting coach, Graham Thorpe, will stay in the England setup.

2/4/2022,"Growing numbers of adults and children in England are surviving for longer after being diagnosed with cancer, with increases in lifespan seen in almost all types of the disease. Survival for one year and five years rose among adults diagnosed between 2015 and 2019 compared with those whose illness was identified between 2006 and 2010, NHS Digital reported.  Survival is highest in adults who have melanoma of the skin, one of the main forms of skin cancer. Nine out of 10 men now survive for five years, as do almost 95% of women. However, survival remains stubbornly low for other forms of the disease, including pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma, which is mainly caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos. Just 6.3% of men and 7.8% of women who develop mesothelioma are still alive five years later. NHS Digital found that “in England one-year non-standardised net survival has improved, with patients diagnosed between 2015 and 2019 having a higher one-year survival than patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2010. “This trend was seen for all cancers and both genders except for bladder cancer. The largest improvement was 1.6 percentage points on average per year for lung cancer in females.” Greater survival after five years “was seen for all cancers and both genders except for bladder cancer and colon cancer,” the NHS’s statistical arm added. “The largest improvement was myeloma in females, [which was up] 1.4 percentage points on average per year.” Both increases were much bigger among children. In children up to the age of 14 who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2019, one-year survival rose from 90.7% in 2002 to 93.4% in 2019. Five-year survival went up even more over that period, from 77.8% to 85% – a rise of 7.2 percentage points. The figures were compiled by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. About 375,400 people a year across the UK are diagnosed with cancer and about 166,533 die, according to statistics compiled by Cancer Research UK. Overall, 50% of people in England and Wales live for 10 years. Experts say that improved cancer survival is mainly due to advances in treatment and greater public awareness leading to earlier diagnosis. The NHS has run high-profile campaigns urging people with particular symptoms to see a doctor and more people now ask a GP to check out symptoms, such as a lump, bump or change in their general health, such as weight loss or onset of fatigue. However, Anna Jewell, the chair of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce, warned that the chances of survival remained low for people with a number of some forms of the disease. “Although overall cancer survival rates have generally increased in the past decades, we are not seeing the same improvements in prognosis for patients diagnosed with less survivable cancers, including those of the lung, liver, brain, oesophagus, pancreas and stomach.”",News/Society,"People in England surviving cancer for longer, NHS reports",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/cancer-england-survival-statistics-increases-nhs

Bruce takes over from Valérien Ismaël, who was sacked on Wednesday with West Brom fifth in the Championship. The 61-year-old has won promotion to the Premier League four times – twice each with Birmingham and Hull – and is targeting a repeat.  “It is a club I obviously know well from my time in the Midlands and I am already relishing the challenge of taking it forward,” the former Aston Villa and Birmingham manager said. “I did not envisage I would return to management this quickly, but once I got the phone call from Ron [Gourlay, the chief executive], I knew I could not resist the challenge of getting this club back to where they want to be. I am coming in with one aim and that is to get Albion to the Premier League.” Bruce’s son, Alex, has been brought in as part of the backroom staff with Stephen Clemence and Steve Agnew. When Bruce left Newcastle after being a target for considerable abuse, he said: “I think this might be my last job. It’s taken its toll on my whole family and I can’t ignore that. They’ve been worried about me – especially my wife Jan.” West Brom have one win from their past eight games and Bruce’s first match will be on Wednesday at Sheffield United, one of his former clubs.

2/4/2022,"Packed on a commuter train, the body odour of fellow passengers can at times be hard to ignore – now scientists have shed light on how our noses pick up on the stench. While different scents can be highly evocative, only a fraction of our 400 or so odour receptors have been shown to be involved in the perception of specific smells.  “We’re still, I would say, surprisingly ignorant about what all the olfactory receptors do and how they interact with each other to encode olfactory percepts,” said Joel Mainland, a co-author of the research from the University of Pennsylvania and the Monell Chemical Senses Center. Among those that have been uncovered are receptors linked to the perception of cis-3-hexen-1-ol, a chemical that smells like freshly cut grass, and androstenone, a steroid hormone that either smells like urine, sandalwood, or is odourless depending on an individual’s genetic makeup. Now scientists have discovered an odour receptor linked to the perception of body odour, and another linked to the perception of a musky scent. Writing in the journal Plos Genetics, Mainland and colleagues, including researchers from Unilever, report how they asked 1,000 Han Chinese people to rate the intensity and pleasantness of 10 odours on a 100-point scale. Among the odours was galaxolide, a synthetic musk and 3M2H, one of about 120 chemicals that comprise body odour, but which carries the “characteristic scent” by itself. The team then combined the results with an analysis of the whole genome of each participant. The results confirmed previously discovered associations between the perception, including intensity, and genetic variants for specific odour receptors for three out of four of the scents, including androstenone. However the team also found genetic variants linked to the perception of the musky scent of galaxolide and 3M2H, allowing them to identify the odour receptors involved in the detection of these scents in humans for the first time. The findings were backed up by work in which six of the odours, some at different concentrations, were presented to 364 participants from New York City – the majority of whom were Caucasian – suggesting the role of the odour receptors may hold across populations and odour concentrations. Mainland said an unusual finding is that many participants with two copies of a particular genetic variant for one odour receptor were unable to smell galaxolide, suggesting only a single receptor is involved in its detection. “It’s generally the rule that more than one receptor will play some role,” he said. Mainland suggested the findings could, at least theoretically, have practical applications in the development of personal hygiene products – for example in blocking the perception of bad smells. But they are also of personal interest as he is unable to smell 3M2H at normal concentrations. “I would guess I have the non-functional version of this receptor [for 3M2H],” he said, adding he could still smell body odour – likely because he had receptors able to detect other chemicals released by a sweaty armpit. The team also reports an analysis of 29 mutations that have been linked to the perception of particular odours suggests that, in general, genetic variants that occurred more recently in the evolutionary history of humans and other primates are found in odour receptors that appear to be less sensitive. However Mainland stressed it was unclear whether that meant the sense of smell had eroded, noting it is possible other receptors or processing mechanisms may have compensated. Prof Matthew Cobb of the University of Manchester and author of Smell: A Very Short Introduction, said that by focusing on a handful of our smell receptor types, the study provided a scientific basis for what we know intuitively – that some people are more sensitive to certain smells, and this can affect whether the odour seems nice or nasty. “Furthermore, it sheds light on a long debate in human and primate evolution – the extent to which sight has tended to replace smell over the last few million years,” he said. But, he added: “There are another 400 or so receptors to study, and the vast majority of our responses to odours remain a mystery.”",News/Science,Scientists identify how humans detect the smell of body odour and musk,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/03/scientists-identify-how-humans-detect-the-smell-of-body-odour-and-musk
2/4/2022,"A person’s love of nature is partially inherited, a large-scale study of twins has found. Scientists from the National University of Singapore studied how much time twins spent in natural spaces compared with each other and found that they shared a similar level of desire to be in nature.  “The reason we decided to study this in twins is that we could estimate heritability based on the genetic similarities in identical twins (100%) versus genetic similarities in non-identical twins (50%),” said Chia-chen Chang, who led the study. “If a trait, [such as the] desire to be in nature, is clearly more similar between identical twins than non-identical twins, this will then suggest a trait is heritable.” She said that those who live in urban environments without access to nature could end up having a lesser appreciation of it, explaining: “We did not test this in our study but it is possible because previous studies have shown that spending time in nature is linked to increased love of nature.” Using the TwinsUK registry, researchers surveyed 1,153 pairs of twins – identical and non-identical – about how they experienced nature. The twins were asked to rate their familiarity with and desire to be in nature, and how frequently they visit natural spaces such as public parks and private gardens. The study, published in Plos Biology, found that identical (monozygotic) twins, who share almost 100% of their genes, were more similar to each other in their orientation towards nature and how frequently they visited nature compared with fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share about 50% of their genetic material. However, heritability declined with age, perhaps showing that environmental factors such as access to nature and green spaces bring about a love of the outdoors as one grows older. While previous studies have found that spending time in natural spaces improves mental wellbeing, this varies from person to person. For the first time, the researchers say, this study has indicated why that is by suggesting there is likely to be a genetic component in our predispositions towards nature and our likelihood to visit natural spaces. Though proximity to nature increases the likelihood of having an appreciation for it, those with a strong disposition towards enjoying nature may actively seek it out even if it means travelling. The authors added that diverse urban planning is needed to provide access to natural spaces – and the benefits they offer – for all. “Spending time in nature links to better health and wellbeing,” Chang added. “A twin study shows that a person’s desire to be in nature and how often they experience it are influenced by both genes and personal experiences.” The TwinsUK database was set up by Prof Tim Spector from King’s College London in 1992 to investigate the incidence of osteoporosis and other rheumatic conditions in several hundred identical twins, but the group now includes more than 15,000 identical and non-identical twins from across the UK.

2/4/2022,"Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi took over as leader of Islamic State in 2019 following the deaths in quick succession of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Baghdadi’s nominated successor Abu Hassan al-Muhajjir. The US operation to try to kill him had been in the planning stages since early December, when officials became convinced that he was living in a nondescript three-storey building on the outskirts of Atme in Syria’s Idlib province, close to the Turkish border.  He and his family had been in the house for 11 months, according to his landlord. Qurayshi said he was from Aleppo and was carrying a Syrian ID. He moved in with three children, a wife and another woman whom he said was his sister. The operation was complicated by the fact that Qurayshi was known to only rarely leave his residence on the building’s third floor, instead relying upon a network of couriers in order to interact with others. The only known exception was when he sometimes would go to the building’s roof to bathe, officials said. Administration officials said that President Biden approved the operation on Tuesday morning in the Oval Office. US special forces flew in from Erbil in Iraq, arriving at approximately 3am local time (1am GMT). A man speaking Arabic with an Iraqi accent through a loudspeaker told the occupants of the house that they had 15 minutes to surrender. People fled from the first of the building, and a short while later, according to the US, Qurayshi detonated explosives in his home, causing a blast so large that bodies were blown out on the ground. After the blast, special forces stormed the building, where they opened fire on Qurayshi’s top lieutenant and his wife, who had barricaded themselves in their home on the second floor. Both were killed but four children were rescued. Witnesses said the US troops were on the ground for more than two hours – a long time for a special forces operation. A total of 13 people lay dead by the time the Americans left. It is not clear how many were killed by direct US fire, and how many died during the purported blast inside the house. A blood splatter near a large pool of congealed blood appeared to support the claim that a powerful blast had detonated near a person. Biden later said that a raid rather than an airstrike had been ordered to minimise civilian casualties. He also claimed that the high death count was caused by the explosion inside the house, and not a US attack. A helicopter used to ferry forces to the scene suffered some form of malfunction, in circumstances that are not clear. It was destroyed by a circling US jet and the wreckage remains near the house. All troops returned safely to Erbil. Photos later circulated of the face of a dead man closely resembled a photograph of Qurayshi. American forensic experts took DNA samples of his body to match against samples they already had and Biden later confirmed the identification. The precise version of events was still unclear hours after the attack. As is often the case in complex attacks carried out in the dark, it may be some time before clarity on who was killed and by whom is reached.",News/World news,Visual guide to deadly US raid targeting Islamic State leader in Syria,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/visual-guide-to-deadly-us-raid-targeting-islamic-state-leader-in-syria
2/4/2022,"Families are facing the biggest fall in disposable income for three decades, according to the Bank of England, with rising energy prices and other consumer inflation hitting incomes. The government has responded to the cost of living crisis with the announcement of a package of measures. Here we look at the impact on a range of different people.  This family uses 25% more gas and electricity than the average household and their annual dual fuel bill will rise from £1,600 a year currently to a whopping £2,464 a year in April – an increase of £864. Like everyone else they will receive the chancellor’s £200 payment in October, and their property qualifies them for the £150 council tax rebate in April. However, their £200,000 tracker mortgage will also rise £20 a month or £240 a year on 1 March after the interest rate rise. At the start of April the net wages of both parents will fall by £255 a year as a result of the higher national insurance charge. For this pensioner, medical conditions mean she keeps the heating on in at least two rooms from October to April, so she uses 15% more gas and electricity than the average household. She can expect to pay an extra £800 a year to her energy supplier after April. That will be mitigated by the £200 energy rebate loan. Because she lives in a large band E home, she is not entitled to the £150 council tax rebate. Her low income may entitle her to a discretionary payment from the local authority, and she may already qualify for reduced council tax because of benefits she receives. The warm home discount she gets because she is on pension credit payment is worth £140 a year, and will be £150 next year. She pays no national insurance and her mortgage is long paid off. This family rent a council home, so they are not facing a hike in their mortgage costs. The energy price cap change will hit them harder than most because they pay with cash – they are likely to face bills of £2,101 a year. They will receive £200 off that via the rebate loan. They also qualify for the £150 council tax rebate. They currently don’t get the warm home discount but might do next winter as eligibility is to be expanded and so they could get £150 off. At the start of April the take-home pay of the working parent willfall by £130 a year as a result of the national insurance surcharge. This family has a prepayment meter. They try to keep the heating off as much as possible but still manage to use what the energy regulator, Ofgem, considers average use, which means in April their costs will increase by £708 to £2,017 a year. This is £46 a year more than if they were able to pay by direct debit. The chancellor’s loan of £200 in October and the £150 council tax rebate will partially offset their energy bill spike. They have no mortgage but their rent could go up when their current tenancy ends. The parent’s net income will fall £130 a year after April, as a result of the national insurance increase. Their six-bedroom detached house eats energy to the extent they use twice as much as the average UK household. They are in for a very nasty shock come April when their bills will rise to just under £4,000 a year – an increase of £1,386 compared with the previous year. This will be barely offset by the £200 energy payment paid to all households. Their home doesn’t qualify for the council tax rebate. The 1.25% national insurance surcharge that hits salaries in April will cost the high earner £1,130 a year. Their £400,000 mortgage payments are rising £44 a month to £2,438.",News/Business,How Sunak’s cost of living support will affect UK households,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/sunak-cost-of-living-support-uk-households-chancellor-measures-disposable-income
2/4/2022,"KPMG is being sued for £1.3bn by government officials liquidating the collapsed contractor Carillion, in a unprecedented legal action against one of the big four auditors. Carillion’ collapsed in January 2018 with £7bn in debts, resulting in 3,000 job losses and chaos across government and private-sector projects ranging from building hospitals, schools, roads and even work on Liverpool football club’s stadium, Anfield.  The scandal has also directed intense scrutiny towards the role of auditors, including those at KPMG who produced unqualified audit opinions even as the risks built up on Carillion’s balance sheet. Several failures and many subsequent inquiries have prompted the government to overhaul British audit regulations. The £1.3bn high court claim for audit negligence includes dividends worth £210m Carillion paid out that would not have been justifiable had auditors flagged the true extent of its financial peril, plus trading losses of nearly £1.1bn incurred as the group wrongly continued to trade when it should have been declared insolvent, according to particulars of claim filed by the official receiver’s lawyers. KPMG received £29m for its audit work for Carillion over the course of 19 years without ever qualifying its opinion. Accountants can qualify audit opinions – inserting caveats that warn of concerns – if they find a serious issue with company disclosures. “The precise reasons for KPMG’s failings are unclear, pending further disclosure,” said the claimants, but argued that the accountancy firm failed to maintain its independence from Carillion. In particular, the then lead audit partner Peter Meehan “repeatedly accepted hospitality from and offered hospitality to Carillion and its senior management, failed to respect the proper boundaries of the auditor/client relationship, [and] offered assistance to the executive management in getting figures ‘past’ the audit committee”. Meehan is also accused of backdating an audit opinion on a Carillion construction subsidiary. The UK’s official receiver, a government official, has brought the action as part of its duty to try to maximise returns for creditors. A spokesperson for the receiver said: “Following extensive investigations looking into the causes of Carillion’s liquidation, the official receiver has submitted a claim to the high court concerning KPMG’s role as auditor for the company’s accounts. “The official receiver has taken this action in the interests of creditors who lost substantially in the liquidation. The decision is based on legal advice, which is that KPMG is answerable to Carillion’s creditors for losses that have been caused.” Losing the case could present financial liabilities to KPMG that vastly overshadow fines levied related to previous accounting scandals. It was fined £3m in January for failures during its audit of the Bargain Booze owner Conviviality, and last year it received a near-record fine of £13m related to the sale of bed maker Silentnight. Aside from the scandals, KPMG has reported booming trade in recent months, led by a surge in fees from advising on company mergers and acquisitions. The average distribution to UK partners increased by 20% from £572,000 in 2020 to £688,000 for 2021. The accountancy firm is in the unusual position of having already admitted that misconduct occurred in relation to the Carillion audit. Last month KPMG UK’s chief executive, Jon Holt, said it was “clear” that misconduct had occurred and apologised after the Financial Reporting Council, the accounting regulator, accused five former KPMG auditors of misconduct. The tribunal has heard weeks of evidence including allegations that the five former auditors at KPMG, including Meehan were involved in forging documents sent to the regulator shortly before Carillion’s collapse to cover up gaps in the audit. However, during the tribunal KPMG has sought consistently to differentiate between the audit itself and the alleged misconduct that followed. It has not admitted any failings related directly to the audit. The firm is expected to argue that the official receiver is trying to use it effectively as an insurance policy to cover the losses from ill-conceived company strategy that was the sole responsibility of Carillion’s board. Eight former Carillion directors are facing legal action from the Insolvency Service to prevent them from serving as directors. They are contesting the action. A KPMG UK spokesperson said: “We believe this claim is without merit and we will robustly defend the case. Responsibility for the failure of Carillion lies solely with the company’s board and management, who set the strategy and ran the business.” Meehan was approached for comment via his lawyer.",News/Business,KPMG being sued for £1.3bn over Carillion audit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/kpmg-being-sued-for-13bn-over-carillion-audit-uk-official-receiver
2/4/2022,"A 63-year-old convicted murderer and former soldier known as the “Galician Rambo” because of his survival skills and history of jailbreaks has been arrested by police in north-west Spain after spending almost a year on the run. Alfredo Sánchez Chacón, who was supposed to remain behind bars until 2025 for the murder of a man in 1996 and other offences, failed to return to prison after being allowed out on a day pass last March.  He was arrested in the early hours of Thursday after residents of the Galician municipality of Valdoviño noticed a man trying to force his way into a house and informed a local Guardia Civil officer. The off-duty police officer headed to the house and soon noticed movement nearby. “After waiting a while, he saw a person emerging from a thicket with a rucksack on his back,” the force said. “As he headed towards the road, the officer gave chase and ordered him to stop. The man dropped his rucksack to try to get away more quickly, but was caught and subdued by the officer after a brief chase.” A Guardia Civil source told El País that Sánchez Chacón was limping, adding: “He’s pretty old now and very broken.” After being taken to hospital for a check-up, he was placed in a cell in the Galician city of Ferrol while he waited to appear in court. Police investigating the 1996 murder spent seven months searching for Sánchez Chacón before he was spotted in a brothel and arrested in March 1997. He had been in jail in Vigo for just a few months before he and a fellow inmate escaped by knotting together sheets and climbing out of a window. The fugitive then evaded capture for two years by drawing on the training he had received as a member of the Spanish Legion and moving around the countryside of northern Spain. He was recaptured in a bar in November 1999, only to escape once again in 2001. That time, however, his bid for freedom lasted just 25 minutes.",News/World news,‘Galician Rambo’ arrested in north-west Spain after nearly a year on the run,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/galician-rambo-arrested-spain-alfredo-sanchez-chacon
2/4/2022,"“To be honest, I wouldn’t have said it.” Rishi Sunak’s blunt remark about Boris Johnson’s comments on Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile was the clearest indication yet that he is distancing himself from his beleaguered boss.  Speaking in the flag-bedecked Downing Street conference room without Johnson alongside him, Sunak was attempting to set out in soothing tones a package of measures aimed at easing the pain of the cost of living crisis. But, as ever in recent weeks, another crisis – that facing the prime minister’s leadership – impinged on proceedings. Less than an hour earlier, Johnson’s close aide Munira Mirza had resigned, citing the prime minister’s failure to apologise for trying to smear Starmer by falsely connecting him with the failure to prosecute Savile. Pressed on whether Johnson should give a full apology for the remarks, as Mirza had asked, Sunak repeatedly replied it was a matter for Johnson himself. Sunak didn’t say much. He didn’t have to. The comments are bound to be read by some of his colleagues as the strongest signal yet he may believe it is now time to act. Certainly, the chancellor looks like being the frontrunner in any leadership race – and his handling of the cost-of-living squeeze is being closely watched by backbenchers as a test of his political nous. The cost of living crisis is a present danger to him. But the past is too. Many Tory MPs were already less than impressed with his insistence on increasing national insurance contributions as the quid pro quo for funding Johnson’s costly plans for the NHS and social care. They are unlikely to be reassured by the fact that inflation is likely to hit 7% in the coming months. In effect, he is now handing households a rebate, at the same time as increasing their taxes – giving with one hand and taking with the other. It was also Sunak who doggedly insisted on cutting universal credit payments, which had been increased by £20 a week to help the poorest families weather the pandemic. After a furious backlash, which was partially reversed at the autumn budget by reducing the taper rate at which it is withdrawn. Sunak’s careful approach to the public finances is praised by colleagues keen to see the Tories win back their reputation for fiscal competence. But others regard it as politically tone deaf, as the after-effects of the pandemic continue to ripple through the economy. Caution about the public finances also appeared to be behind his decision to cushion the blow of rocketing energy prices partly with loans, which will ultimately have to be repaid by consumers themselves, rather than the taxpayer footing the bill. That is effectively a bet on energy prices coming back down again in future years. If they remain high for longer than expected, the Treasury may yet have to extend the scheme. Another of Sunak’s political principles – a reluctance to interfere in business – appeared to be behind his decision to avoid taxing energy companies to pay for the measures, something Labour has been calling for since the autumn. Polls suggest that would be a popular approach, with oil companies raking in huge profits; but it cuts against Sunak’s brand of free market Conservatism. He has frequently restrained Johnson’s free-spending instincts, believing as he said in Thursday’s press conference that managing the public finances responsibly is what the public have the right to expect from his party. “As long as I have this job I’m going to do what I believe to be right in the long-term interests of the country,” he said. But there is increasing focus at Westminster on how well his sombre brand of Conservatism would fit him for another job altogether.",News/Politics,Sunak’s bluntness about Johnson could be sign he has eye on the prize,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/sunaks-bluntness-about-johnson-could-be-sign-he-has-eye-on-the-prize
2/4/2022,"Britain’s highest-paid university chief and another senior executive created a culture of favouritism and exclusion at Imperial College, according to damning details of a report released after she had attempted to suppress its publication. Imperial’s president, Alice Gast, last year apologised after an independent report found that she and the college’s chief financial officer had bullied members of staff. However, they have resisted calls by student and academic representatives to resign, while she attempted to block the report’s release under freedom of information.  But redacted details were published on Thursday after the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) rejected Gast’s arguments against the release and disagreed with her attempts to downplay the findings against her as “relatively minor”. They include accounts of Gast and Muir Sanderson’s behaviour and its impact on victims who were bullied in 2019 and 2020. Jane McNeill QC, who carried out the investigation, said some witnesses had expressed a fear of retaliation. McNeill found that Gast and Sanderson had “created or contributed to a culture which involves and tolerates favouritism, exclusion, the making of disparaging comments about others and at times a lack of respect for others”. Referring to Gast and Sanderson by their initials, the report goes on to state: “In relation to both AG and MS, several witnesses described a culture of favouritism: you are ‘in or out’; ‘the favourite child’; ‘a hero or zero’; or in the ‘in gang or out gang’. One witness said that there were a lot of employees at any one time ‘in the rubbish pot’.” McNeill’s report found that Gast had bullied a colleague, which she has apologised for, but that her treatment of some others did not amount to bullying. Sanderson has apologised for bullying two colleagues. The report found he had bullied one person and said it made no finding that he had bullied others. Imperial is subject to an investigation by the universities watchdog, the Office for Students, over the bullying allegations. It was announced last year that Gast – the highest-paid university chief among the elite Russell Group – is to step down from her £554,000 role when her contract expires this year. Sanderson’s behaviour to one victim was described as “aggressive and intimidating”. She was undermined and spoken to in a condescending and offensive way, with “stark examples” such as being addresses as “young lady” and being told to “watch her tone”. “The evidence I heard also raises questions about whether MS’s character and powerful role within the College, encompassing the roles of both CFO and COO, impact on good decision-making in the College,” McNeill wrote. McNeill said there was reference to “alpha male” behaviour by Sanderson and some others – but there was insufficient evidence to lead her to conclude there was a sexist culture. However, comments such as “watch your tone, young lady” should alert the college authorities to a risk of a complaint of sex discrimination arising from similar comments or behaviours, she said. Similarly, she warned that other comments could suggest negative treatment relating to other protected characteristics. For example, one witness alleged that Sanderson had used the expression “[leaving] the plantation”. “These types of comments have no place in a modern workplace. It is troubling in this day and age that one of the most senior employees at an institution like Imperial College should think that a comment made by a senior employee referring to a ‘one-armed black lesbian’ should be treated as a joke,” the report found. Sanderson said he had no recollection of using the term. Referring to Gast’s behaviour and the impact on a victim, whose name is redacted, the report said: “AG, as president of the College, has exercised her position in such a way as to undermine [X] both personally and professionally. [X’s] self-esteem and self-confidence have been badly affected and [X] has suffered from lack of sleep and weight loss.” Other findings about the overall culture at Imperial – which echoed concerns that have been expressed consistently in confidence to the Guardian by a range of staff – included “a culture of making disparaging comments about others who are absent”. Gast said on Thursday: “It was personally devastating for me to find that my behaviour fell short of both the College’s and my own expectations and that it had affected a colleague in this way.” “I repeat my sincere apologies. I pledged to use the experience as a catalyst for positive change for both me and Imperial. In the two years since these events took place, I have worked hard to ensure that my colleagues feel fully supported as we all contribute to improvements in the College culture.” Sanderson said: “The report makes as uncomfortable reading now as it did in 2020. I have apologised for my actions and I remain sorry. I cooperated fully with the investigation and accepted the disciplinary sanctions applied.” Despite her apology, a ruling by the ICO on the release of details of the report revealed that Gast argued that it should not be released as the findings against her were “relatively minor”, a claim the ICO dismissed. It also rejected her drawing of parallels between herself and Dr Kathleen Stock, the philosophy professor who resigned from her job at the University of Sussex after a row over her views on gender identification and transgender rights.",News/Education,Damning report reveals details of bullying at helm of Imperial College,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/03/damning-report-reveals-details-of-bullying-at-helm-of-imperial-college
2/4/2022,"Aditya Chakrabortty (A tale of two towns – one in the north, one in the south – exposes the lie of ‘levelling up’, 2 February) is quite right to point to the dishonesty that is at the centre of the Tory “levelling up” slogan. First, because the money available is nowhere near what is needed for the task – much is bluster and spin. Second, because it deliberately creates a false division between working-class communities in the north of England and in London, when the government dumps on both equally. In the 1960s, Edmonton, which Chakrabortty’s article refers to, was part of the significant Lea Valley industrial area, as was Tottenham, where I live. The Tottenham sound of the Dave Clark Five rivalled that of another industrial working-class area, the Merseyside of the Beatles. In the 1980s, both areas were laid waste by the Thatcher government as part of a deliberate strategy.  The neo-Thatcherites in the present government are not about to sort out the industrial mess and the destruction of working-class lives that their predecessors managed 40 years ago.Keith FlettTottenham, London  The levelling up that’s needed is not just regional – it’s about building a fairer society in the whole of this wealthy country. It means children from state schools having the same opportunities as those from private schools, and families from Cornwall to Norfolk, Newcastle to Bristol and Stoke being able to afford decent homes. It means no one having to choose between heating and eating, while for others the choice is which of their houses shall they spend this weekend in and in which car shall they travel to it. It means taxing the rich, closing tax loopholes, giving contracts to the best rather than the best friends, and using a proper proportion of the nation’s wealth for those whose needs are greatest. It will never happen under a Conservative government.Joy WebbPenistone, South Yorkshire  The government must have spent more time developing the front cover of the levelling-up white paper than its contents, because after a decade of Tory-driven austerity and the deindustrialisation of the 1980s, the government’s proposals are woefully inadequate. The proposals are merely a reshuffling of the deck chairs on the Titanic. As a 15-year-old student, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of austerity cuts in schools. The secretary of state for levelling up oversaw these brutal cuts when he served as education secretary. He decimated the education service, thus levelling down the performance of students, so how on earth can he be considered the right man to level up Britain?Harry AldridgePlymouth  The disproportionality of allocation between rich constituencies such as Bromsgrove and poor local authorities such as Knowsley (Report, 2 February), suggests that Michael Gove and his colleagues are great fans of Billie Holiday, and of one song in particular.

2/4/2022,"Raising the rate of national insurance contributions (NICs) by 1.25 percentage points across the board is an unnecessary way to fund health and social care spending (Boris Johnson ‘fully committed’ to national insurance rise, 28 January). Instead, billions of pounds could be raised by levelling up the current rate of 2% paid on employee annual earnings above £50,000 to 12%, ie the rate currently paid on earnings between around £9,500 and £50,000. Employee NICs are no different to income tax. We know this because HMRC’s annual tax summaries, sent to every taxpayer, combine income tax and NICs in calculating how our taxes have contributed to government spending. So there is no reason why the poorest in the land should be paying 12% on a major proportion of their income, while the richest are paying only 2% on a major proportion of theirs.Neil HornsbyInverness   Boris Johnson is right: it is “absolutely vital to find the money” to invest in the NHS and social care, but not through an unfair increase in national insurance – a regressive tax levied on workers, employers and the self-employed. Instead, raising income tax and capital gains tax would ensure that taxpayers receiving income from wealth and pensions would also be required to contribute, spreading the burden more widely and fairly.Kim LoaderGoathland, North Yorkshire  While the government is going to tax income more through higher NICs, a couple in their 70s who own their home can inherit a house from a widowed parent, sell it for £300,000 and have no tax to pay. Taxing inheritance more would fund social care for the elderly. It would reduce the iniquity whereby heirs who inherit from parents whose wealth went on care fees are left with depleted inheritances, while those whose parents live autonomously until they die do so much better.Alan FairsBewdley, Worcestershire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/4/2022,"The head of the official statistics watchdog has reprimanded Boris Johnson and the Home Office for incorrectly saying crime has fallen by 14%, when this excludes the fastest-rising category of crime. Sir David Norgrove, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, said he would be writing to the offices of Johnson and Priti Patel, the home secretary, to highlight what he called a “misleading” use of statistics.  Replying to a letter about the claims from Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Norgrove said Johnson and Patel had been incorrect to claim that crime was falling. A Home Office press release from last week twice “presented the statistics to give a positive picture of trends in crime in England and Wales” between June 2019 and September 2021, but did so by not including fraud and computer misuse, he wrote. “The exclusion was stated. However, in the title and in two other places the release refers to a fall in crime, without making clear that this is true only if fraud and computer misuse are excluded,” the letter said, Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Johnson said the government was “cutting crime by 14%”, a reference to statistics between September 2019 and September 2021. This also excluded fraud and computer misuse “though the prime minister did not make that clear”, Norgrove wrote. He said: “If fraud and computer misuse are counted in total crime as they should be, total crime in fact increased by 14% between the year ending September 2019 and the year ending September 2021. The ONS bulletin quite properly includes fraud and computer misuse in total crime.” Fraud and computer misuse offences have climbed significantly during lockdown and other Covid restrictions, while other offences such as theft have dropped. Carmichael called it “a damning verdict from the official watchdog”. He said: “When the government’s record on crime is so bad that both the prime minister and home secretary feel the need to fiddle the figures, it is clear we need a new approach. “The prime minister must come before parliament to apologise for his latest lie and set the record straight.” The government has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,"Johnson and Patel’s claims about falling crime ‘misleading’, says UK watchdog",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/johnson-and-patels-claims-about-falling-crime-misleading-says-uk-watchdog

2/4/2022,"The government has admitted it is spending £4.7m a day on accommodating refugees from Afghanistan and other asylum seekers in hotels, a figure four times the amount previously stated. Refugee organisations criticised the Home Office for the slow progress it has made towards finding permanent homes for refugees brought to the UK from Afghanistan last year. Campaigners have consistently warned that, aside from the cost, hotels are inappropriate places to house families long-term.  The Home Office was forced to clarify the cost of the policy, after the deputy permanent secretary, Tricia Hayes, told the home affairs select committee on Wednesday that a total of £1.2m was being spent every day on hotel accommodation. The department said on Thursday that this figure actually only covered the 12,000 people being resettled after being airlifted out of Kabul. Another £3.5m a day is spent on housing 25,000 more asylum seekers. The home secretary, Priti Patel, admitted this week that the government was “absolutely struggling” to find accommodation for 12,000 people from Afghanistan who remain in hotels almost six months after being evacuated last August. About 4,000 have been found permanent homes but the home secretary said officials were “desperately trying” to find alternative housing for the rest. “We do not have the infrastructure … in terms of housing and accommodation,” she said. “We do not want people in hotels,” she added. “We should not be housing people in hotels.” The clarification of the figures by the Home Office is likely to focus attention on its failure to procure longer-term homes for refugees. Ministers argue that local authorities have failed to provide the housing, while some local authorities say homes have been offered but the Home Office system to allocate them is very inefficient, leading to houses being left empty unnecessarily. Enver Solomon, chief executive officer of the Refugee Council, described the use of hotels as “an incredibly costly and failed strategy that could be easily fixed by using public money more effectively to house people in our communities and allow them the right to work”. He said being housed in hotels caused “real harm to men, women and children who have come to our shores in search of safety”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The use of hotels is unacceptable. It is a short-term solution to the global migration crisis and we are working hard to find appropriate dispersed accommodation for migrants, asylum seekers and Afghan refugees as soon as possible.
