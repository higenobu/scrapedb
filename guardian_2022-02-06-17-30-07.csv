2/6/2022,"To me it’s one of the perpetual mysteries of gardening: why some plants, despite appearing to really have it all, somehow still languish away from the horticultural spotlight. Very near to the top of that list must be hellebores, with their exotic blooms opening up as if by magic in the dead of winter. Their flowers often last for months at a time on evergreen, drought-tolerant, fuss-free plants. I often wonder if it’s their incredible generosity combined with ease of cultivation that causes us to take them for granted. Seeming to defy the seasons, Helleborus foetidus ‘Wester Flisk Group’ is bursting into bloom right now, its finely divided foliage and pistachio-flowers on salmon-pink stems making it appear like it belongs on some far-flung forest floor in the tropics. If you crave the look of a schefflera or one of the palmate begonias, but can’t handle their upkeep (or price tag), this makes a perfect doppleganger. Like all hellebores, it even thrives in dry shade where little else will grow.  If truly fabulous winter greenery is your thing, Helleborus x sternii ‘Blackthorn Strain’ has prickly edged leaves covered in the most wonderfully reptilian green mottling, a botanical animal that gives you full-on Jurassic Park vibes. Finally, on the foliage front, the soft, bright green mounds of Helleborus multifidus erupt out of the ground like a bubbling emerald spring. Now, let’s talk flowers. “Unique” can be an overused word in horticulture, but the haunting mix of steel-blue, violet and grey hues in the velvety petals of Helleborus ‘Blue Diamond’ is really impossible to find anywhere else in the botanical world. Unlike in other plants where all the extra petals of double flowers can remove part of their wild charm, in hellebores they give them the wondrous ability to impersonate other species. To my eyes, Helleborus ‘Onyx Odyssey’ looks like a giant cherry blossom but, as its name suggests, with the deepest black and a silvery-grey powder coating over its petals. ‘Wedding Party Bridesmaid’ is altogether more soft and delicate with a whiff of the forest cacti bloom about it. White petals are tipped with blackcurrant edging on one end, fading to palest jade green towards the centre. Just straight-up gorgeous. There is even a whole series of doubles with an elegant water lily-esque look. ‘Hebe’ has burgundy breaks that bleed through the ice-white petals and, if you want even more colour, ‘Artemis’ features a very similar wine-coloured mottling, but over acid yellow. Given that some of this detail needs to be appreciated close up and their nodding heads can hide some of their true wonder in the garden, their splendour is sometimes best appreciated as a cut flower, with individual blooms placed floating in a bowl of water. A beautiful, unconventional form of floristry indoors, or alternatively the easiest eye-catching display floating in container ponds or water urns outdoors. It really is hard to think of any single plant that can offer quite so much, at a time of year that often offers so little.

2/6/2022,"If, as seems increasingly probable, Russia decides not to launch an all-out invasion of Ukraine, tub-thumping US and British politicians who have spent weeks scaring the public with loose talk of looming Armageddon will have some explaining to do. The military build-up directed by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, is real enough. But suspicion grows that the actual as opposed to the hypothetical threat of a large-scale conventional attack is being mis-read, misinterpreted, over-estimated or deliberately exaggerated.  It wouldn’t be the first time. This view is shared in part by Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who last week demanded that the US president, Joe Biden, stop suggesting invasion was “imminent”. Wild American talk of war was damaging his country and stoking panic, he said. Fulminating against “self-fulfilling prophecies”, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, is also trying to calm the rhetoric. He and Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who has refused to join the armchair warriors, may soon meet Putin for talks in Moscow. Warning lights flashed red in late January when British intelligence officials briefed anonymously that invasion could be “two to three weeks away”. This echoed alarmist US predictions of conflict “at any time”. A furious war on truth is already under way. Russia claims US mercenaries are active in Ukraine. Dubious allegations of a plot to oust Zelenskiy were floated by Liz Truss’s Foreign Office. Washington says a fake video, not yet seen by anyone, shows a staged attack on Russian forces. As Britain’s Boris Johnson, keen to show fealty and distract from partygate, warned of a “lightning” strike, Biden talked in messianic terms about a “world-changing” conflict, beginning in February. They may yet be right. But February has arrived, and still no war. As Biden orders the 82nd Airborne Division to eastern Europe this weekend, Putin is chilling with his “dear friend”, President Xi Jinping, at the winter Olympics in Beijing – not an obvious spot from which to launch a blitzkrieg. Deploring “western hysteria”, the Kremlin denies any intention to invade. Putin said last week he hoped “dialogue” would succeed – while refusing to pull back his forces. Putin is not a man to be trusted. His reasoning is twisted, his brinkmanship notorious, his instincts brutal. But he does seem to have been given pause by the feverish US response. He now appears focused on extracting maximum diplomatic advantage, meaning concessions on European security, Nato, and new US medium-range missile deployments, while maintaining military pressure. Putin has also given Kyiv’s “western puppets” a nasty shock. That may have been his game-plan all along. If this phoney war ends with a whimper, not a bang, Johnson and other mini-Churchills will declare victory, saying they faced down aggression. European leaders will argue that diplomacy was vindicated. Even so, relieved people across Europe, subjected daily to over-heated predictions of mayhem, will be entitled to ask: what, really, was all that about? Was the intelligence wrong – again? The answer, in a word, is China. It’s true Biden strongly backs Nato, which underpins US interests in Europe. It’s true, too, that as a cold war veteran, his instinct is to uphold democracy and freedom in countries threatened by Moscow. Yet the overriding, urgent thrust of his foreign policy to date has focused on the Indo-Pacific region, and specifically on America’s greatest challenger, China – not on Europe. So when the US was confronted by a possibly precedent-setting attack on a sovereign nation, the chilling implications for self-governing Taiwan and Beijing’s other target territories quickly became central to White House calculations. Taiwan is not a war the US would necessarily win. It’s not a war Biden wants to fight. But he knows any sign of weakness in confronting Putin over Ukraine may be read in Beijing as indicating fatal weakness over Taiwan. When he cites “world-changing” threats, Biden is talking principally about this accelerating, unboundaried 21st-century contest with China. In a globalised world, few if any conflicts occur in isolation. In this sense, Ukraine is an early skirmish in what historians may one day view as a new hundred years war. Restless Kazakhstan, where Putin recently deployed troops with Beijing’s blessing, is another frontline. Others include potential or actual conflict zones from the Baltic republics and Belarus to Libya, Syria, Myanmar, the Indian frontier, Xinjiang and the South China Sea. China and Russia are moving into ever closer alliance. Their leaders share the same post-Communist, authoritarian, nationalist ideology. Both view the US as the champion of an international, democratic, rules-based system they want to tear down. Both believe America is in terminal decline. Even before this weekend’s tryst, Putin and Xi had formed a common front to resist western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine and on China over its Hong Kong crackdown and Uyghur genocide. Now they are doubling down. The two countries play an “important stabilising role” in global affairs, rendering international relations “more equitable and inclusive”, Putin told Xinhua news agency. While military cooperation and trade are growing rapidly, new deals on gas supplies to China, Russia’s biggest energy customer, are also in the pipeline. A Nato-style mutual defence treaty may not be far off. The birth of this Sino-Russian axis, conceived in opposition to the US-led western democracies, is the most globally significant strategic development since the Soviet Union collapsed 30 years ago. It will define the coming age. Fear of what China might do helps explain Biden’s frenetic, sometimes hyperbolic, response to the siege of Kyiv. It’s important Putin be shown bullying does not work. But this crisis, fundamentally, is not solely about Ukraine or even Europe. Writ large, it’s about the whole scary, contested, disorderly new world that awaits.",News/World news,Biden rattles his sabre at Putin … but it’s Xi he really wants to scare,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/biden-rattles-his-sabre-at-putin-but-its-xi-he-really-wants-to-scare
2/6/2022,"Wedged between Let’s Make A Deal and General Hospital in the US daytime TV ratings is the The View, a venerable, sometimes contentious forum for gossip, banter and political debate. To some, it’s an inspired cultural phenomenon; to others a blundering mess. Sometimes both. Either way, it has been on since 1997 after being created by expert guest tear-inducer and news legend Barbara Walters around the premise of women of different generations – ‘the ladies” – debating headlines of the day.  Last week, it – again – veered into contentious turf when Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg – a Black cast member since 2007 when Rosie O’Donnell stormed out after an explosive confrontation with co-host Elizabeth Hasselbeck about the Iraq war – voiced her opinion that the Holocaust was “not about race”. “This is white people doing it to white people, so y’all going to fight amongst yourselves,” she continued after being challenged that it was precisely about race and ethnicity. The show’s producers faded to mood music and cut to a commercial break. The conversation had its own controversial origins: a recent decision by a school district in Tennessee to remove Art Spiegelman’s Maus, the graphic novel about the Holocaust, from its curriculum. Goldberg provoked outcry from Jewish groups and others, proceeded to repeat her thoughts on late-night TV, subsequently apologized twice and was then handed a two-week unpaid suspension and advised by the ABC News president, Kim Godwin, “to take time and reflect on the impact of her comments”. In one sense, last week’s spat was the kind of hot interaction in which The View excels and it generated a slew of headlines and talking points. On the other hand, no one in their right mind wants a host accused of antisemitism and the headlines were largely the sort that any network head would prefer to avoid. But The View has long been a source of trouble – both good and bad – and a huge national platform. In its original format, The View counted Walters, broadcast journalist Meredith Viera, lawyer Star Jones, TV host Debbie Matenopoulos and comedian Joy Behar among its number. “We started with them because we liked them the best,” recalled producer Bill Geddie in Ramin Setoodah’s account of the show, Ladies Who Punch. “A comedian in her fifties, a journalist mom in her forties, a professional lawyer in her thirties, and someone in her twenties.” Three weeks into the show’s start, Princess Diana was killed in a car crash. Debbie wept. “By going all in on feelings, The View embodied a moment,” Setoodah wrote. Five months on from that, the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke with its hot-button characters: a philandering president who claimed to be a feminist, a young woman, a vindictive friend in the form of Linda Tripp who Behar christened “Mrs Ronald Macdonald”, and a devastated wife. “The Europeans are laughing at us,” Behar continued. “You cannot bring a country down to its knees because a girl is on her knees.” The show quickly became a political go-to for its direct access to stay-at-home moms. “The politicians want to go on the view because it gives them a national audience and also gives them access to the individual groups that watch the particular panels,” political strategist Hank Sheinkopf told the Guardian. In 2010, Barack Obama became the first sitting president to appear on this or any daytime chatshow. His successor appeared 18 times before he took office, including one in which he said his daughter was so pretty he might date her. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton used the show as a warm-up act for her 2008 and 2106 presidential runs. Most recently, last October, she warned “the ladies” that Donald Trump continued to perpetuate a ‘full constitutional crisis” But in recent years, The View has slipped in the ratings. Barbara Walters retired, and the show took on a more contentious political edge when it hired Meghan McCain, daughter of the late center-right senator John McCain. She left last year, saying she had enjoyed her four years in what she described as an “anthropological experiment in left-wing media”. McCain wrote in a subsequent memoir, Bad Republican, that The View was a “toxic” workplace environment. She quit the show, she wrote, because she felt her colleagues mistreated her for having conservative views. “As the country got worse under Trump, the treatment from Whoopi, Joy and some of the staff grew meaner and less forgiving. “It felt like the co-hosts and staff only knew one Republican – me – and took out all their anger on me, even though I didn’t even vote for Trump,” McCain added. The latest blow-up with Goldberg could have been better handled, many commentators believe. Sheinkopf says ABC’s parent, Disney, could have taken Goldberg in the corporate jet to Poland “to show what actually happened” and to “look at the information instead of shaming her in public”. Instead, the exchange has been left “controversial and unresolved”. According to Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, an African American Jew and professor of theoretical physics who studies the history of race in science, the comments reflected a contextual disagreement. “I think Whoopi Goldberg is wrong and the Holocaust was a genocide rooted in racialization. But I think we have a framework disagreement, and there’s nothing antisemitic about her words.” To Maiysha Kai, lifestyle editor at thegio.com, the exchange reflects “the weird sort of comparative dialogs that aren’t always as helpful as we intend to be”. “I don’t think Whoopi’s intention was to be offensive, but I think there was an error in how it was responded to. This is a forum created for these women to have free speech and often very lively dialogue about certain things.” Shutting the conversation down, Kai says, came off as abrupt, especially after what Black progressives had witnessed for years with Meghan McCain on the same panel. “I feel like we were deprived of a necessary dialogue and probably a really long-overdue one. If there’s an education that needs to happen, which clearly there is, I don’t think it’s an education that she needs alone.” The show’s remit is all about keeping a public conversation going: The View’s epic, 25-years-and-running TV innovation that has centered the views and opinions of outspoken women. In an exchange reported in Ladies Who Punch, Hillary Clinton had gone on the show the day Rosie O’Donnell roasted Donald Trump for his infidelities and money issues, beginning a long feud that made it into two presidential debates. Clinton told Behar she was laughing so hard backstage she was worried she wouldn’t make it on to the set. “Every day we’re in trouble on this show,” Behar responded. Clinton expressed curiosity, wondering why that might happen. “I don’t know,” Behar responded. “We’re just women.”",Arts/Television & radio,Has The View lost sight of its identity as a home for feisty discussion?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/06/the-view-whoopi-goldberg-abc-daytime
2/6/2022,"If a sign of a team’s progress is their ability to win close matches, Scotland are heading firmly in the right direction. This was hardly a conclusive statement of their Six Nations title credentials but it was not a bad start. It was a second successive victory over England for the first time since 1984 – they went on to win their second grand slam that year – and a third in five meetings with England.  If there are plenty of hurdles in the way before such thoughts can be entertained this year, Scotland will head to Cardiff next Saturday with a huge spring in their step. This was far from a perfect performance as their coach, Gregor Townsend, will no doubt point out when the analysis begins in earnest. But after the victories in Llanelli, Twickenham and Paris in the past 16 months, and another tight squeeze against Australia in the autumn, the belief coursing through the tartan ranks is palpable. The encouraging thing is they can play much better than this, but victory was everything. Momentum is firmly with them. Scotland enjoyed more possession and territory than any other side in the Six Nations last year. Here, though, they were living off scraps for the first hour. After 50 minutes they had spent seven seconds in England’s 22. The home side had one real opportunity to score a try and they took it with alacrity. It started with a quick lineout routine and when Maro Itoje rushed up in defence, Stuart Hogg did brilliantly to skip around the England lock’s tackle and slip the charging Darcy Graham through a gap between Nick Isiekwe and Elliot Daly. The Edinburgh wing sized up the situation, stepped inside Joe Marchant and found the supporting Ben White on an inside support line. What a moment for the 23-year-old London Irish scrum-half. His inclusion in the squad – ahead of the more experienced George Horne – and then the matchday 23, given the form of Edinburgh’s Ben Vellacott, raised a few eyebrows north of the border. When Ali Price went off for an HIA after 12 minutes, those concerns only heightened further. One wondered if Townsend had taken an unnecessary gamble. No wonder White was grinning as he was handed his coat on the sidelines following Price’s return. A 12-minute cameo and a debut try. Hogg spoke passionately before the match about the influence of the defence coach, Steve Tandy, on this team. Since the Welshman came in after the 2019 World Cup, said Hogg, Scotland have learned to love defending as much as attacking. The stats bear Hogg out. Scotland have had the best defence in the championship for the past two years. There was more evidence of it here, in spades. England seemed sure to score after half an hour when they mauled a lineout over the line, but Scotland got bodies under the ball and held it up. It was a major let-off. In the final stages, having regained the lead with Finn Russell’s penalty eight minutes from time, they defended frantically but with trust in their systems. If they rode their ruck at times, they continued to believe and got their reward when Russell’s cross-kick was patted forward into touch by Luke Cowan-Dickie. It was hard not argue that Graham, a threat all day with his footwork and pace, would not have scored. The referee, Ben O’Keeffe, agreed and Murrayfield roared its approval. “Scotland, Scotland” reverberated around the ground. The chorus of Flower of Scotland sprang up as the hosts had successive five-metre scrums against England’s seven-man pack. If it was a surprise they did not opt for another one, but Russell’s penalty gave them a lead to defend as the minutes kicked down. As the game ended with four successive scrums in Scotland territory, that nagging doubt persisted. Were England going to steal it at the death? Not this time. Graham won the ball back among a tangle of bodies and Hogg booted the ball off the field, punching the air in celebration. Pandemonium. Scotland are on the march.",Sport/Sport,Scotland can build momentum from famous victory over auld enemy | Bryn Palmer,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/06/scotland-can-build-momentum-from-famous-victory-over-auld-enemy
2/6/2022,"How do you react when someone politely but firmly tells you that you’re talking nonsense about something that’s important to you? Do you gracefully and immediately give way to their greater expertise? Or do you double down? Most of us are in the latter camp. Voicing our beliefs tends to solidify them. We may like to think of ourselves as rational creatures, constantly assessing the world for new information that might change our minds, but this is not how our brains work. Explaining to someone that their belief is flat-out wrong is not a good way of getting them to drop it. And research shows that the process of “myth-busting” – setting out a common false statement, then explaining why it is wrong – backfires because it counterintuitively reinforces and helps spread the myths.  This is why the premise of last week’s Question Time was so flawed. The presenter of the BBC programme, Fiona Bruce, announced in mid-January that the programme wanted to explore why some people had chosen not to be vaccinated against Covid and specifically invited them to apply to be an audience member on the programme. Understanding why some people have not yet been vaccinated despite the wealth of evidence that the vaccines are safe, effective and save lives is hugely important to improving take-up. But there are numerous research reports on this to which a current affairs programme such as Question Time has little to add. And if the objective was instead to increase understanding and build empathy among viewers, its tribal format, in which rhetorical flourish is deployed to score quick wins over opponents, could not be less well suited to the task. In response to widely aired concerns, the programme said it would vet potential audience members to allow ordinary unvaccinated members of the public through while filtering out the fanatics. This is to misunderstand that the expression of reasonable-sounding doubts can be a much more effective transmitter of misinformation than ranting and raving. And sure enough, the programme ended up falling into a number of disinformation traps. The audience member who challenged the panel on vaccine effectiveness was given a huge platform to make a number of false statements about Covid vaccines, including that they have “fairly horrific” side effects whose incidence we do not know. The highly respected immunologist on the panel, Robin Shattock, comprehensively debunked them, while also expressing respect for people who question the evidence. When the audience member challenged Shattock, saying he had looked at the data himself, citing a report to suggest there may be under-reporting, Bruce reminded him of the latter’s credentials. The clip of this exchange will have been viewed many more times than the programme itself: it has gone viral on social media and been widely reported in the press. The tone with which it has been shared has been overwhelmingly positive, with a dash of mocking – isn’t it great how well this misinformation has been demolished (and enjoy someone getting truly owned by a leading expert)? This is because that is exactly what people who have zero doubts about vaccines see: a clip that resoundingly debunks anti-vax myths. But research about how we react to misinformation suggests people with doubts about vaccines, who are less inclined to trust scientific authority, might have seen something different. Dangerous misinformation about vaccines was repeated, reinforcing things they have already heard. Someone who shares some of their doubts was talked down to on the basis of some credible-sounding questions about the legitimacy of data, which may have left them feeling just as confused. The sneery tone of the headlines and social media posts might have felt aimed at them too. This is no criticism of Shattock, who I think did the best job he could under the circumstances, but it is a prime example of a counter-productive piece of public health messaging. Overall, information around vaccines in the UK has been excellent, focusing on the positive story about why to get vaccinated, avoiding the repetition of misinformation by myth-busting and complex explanations that many people do not engage with. But this episode shows the extent to which it is harmful public health messaging that is more likely to go viral. Question Time also bought into another piece of conventional wisdom that disintegrates on close examination: the idea that on most issues people can be divided into tribes based on their fixed beliefs. The whole endeavour was based on the premise that “the unvaccinated” are a group of people who have been “unrepresented” on our national broadcaster, as if they share a coherent set of attitudes. But people have not yet been vaccinated for all sorts of reasons. Imagine thinking it useful to sort a Question Time audience on the basis of other unhealthy behaviour, such as smoking or excessive drinking. While conspiracy thinking can exert a strong pull, in-depth attitudinal research illustrates that people can hold conflicting beliefs at the same time and that they might appear to be in one “tribe” or another depending on how a conversation is framed. For example, a study that interviewed 60 people for two hours each on racism found many people simultaneously hold beliefs that are helpful and unhelpful for anti-racism campaigns. “The idea that there are fixed groups of people – pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine and a persuadable group in the middle – is a massive oversimplification that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Nicky Hawkins, a communications expert who has researched vaccine messaging, tells me. Indeed, people are still coming forward to have their first vaccination, suggesting some are still changing their mind. Too many of us buy into the old, and slightly vain, liberal idea that good and rational speech will always win out over bad and logically incoherent speech. And that people who disagree with us are less complex and more stupid than we are. Freedom of expression is critical to democracy in its own right, but insights from cognitive psychology put paid to the idea that the truest idea will win out, particularly in a world where social media platforms make most profit out of the stuff that hardens our views by making us angry. Campaigners who want to change minds have to be much smarter than simply explaining what makes other people so wrong.

2/6/2022,"What is “The Souvenir”? In Joanna Hogg’s autobiographically inspired 2019 drama, that title appeared to refer specifically to an 18th-century Fragonard painting depicting a young woman (the heroine of Rousseau’s epistolary novel Julie, apparently) carving the name of her lover into a tree trunk. In that film, set in the 1980s, Julie Harte (played by Hogg’s goddaughter Honor Swinton Byrne) is introduced to the painting by an enigmatic man with whom she is falling in love. Like Hogg, Julie is perplexed by what the painting means and by her own increasingly tumultuous feelings for her mysterious companion. In this flipside second instalment of Hogg’s most personal and surprisingly most accessible work, the word “souvenir” takes on a rather more metatextual meaning. This time the film itself becomes a kind of cinematic keepsake, a memory of a memory (or a dream of a dream?) set in the aftermath of Julie’s relationship with the heroin-addicted Anthony. An overwhelming presence in the first episode, as portrayed by Tom Burke, Anthony is now an even more confounding absence, leaving Julie struggling to make sense of their former life together, with all its mysteries and misdirections. Who was her lover? Did she ever really know him? Did he actually work for the Foreign Office? Where did he go as the end approached? Who did he talk to? What was he thinking?  More significantly, The Souvenir Part II finds Julie finding herself, embracing her own future as a film-maker even as she wrestles with the ghosts of the past. Like Eva Husson’s underrated Mothering Sunday (which I stumblingly described in this paper as feeling “more like an emotional memory than an unfolding narrative”), this is a creative coming-of-age story – a portrait of the artist as a young woman discovering her own voice. Appropriately enough, the very last voice we hear in the film’s wonderfully self-reflexive finale is that of Hogg herself. Facing the prospect of having to make her film-school graduation project while still reeling from the fallout of her doomed relationship, Julie channels her personal experiences into a free-form script (a “memorial”) that baffles and irks her tutors. Meanwhile, creative battles also engulf Julie’s fellow film students, most notably wannabe auteur Patrick (Richard Ayoade), whose own film has more than a hint of Julien Temple’s Absolute Beginners (“I always wanted to be like Orson Welles”), and who tells his editor: “You’re forcing me to have a tantrum!” It’s a laugh-out-loud moment, one of many in Hogg’s oeuvre in which intense soul-searching is habitually broken by brittle humour, alerting us to a playful sensibility beneath the often austere surface. There are shocks too: a domestic scene in which Julie’s mother, Rosalind (played once again by a flinty Tilda Swinton), reacts with tremulous grace to an unexpected breakage gave me a start that had me burying my face in my hands – a sort of laughing-screaming-squirming symphony of tragicomic awkwardness. As for the film Julie is making, at times it appears that we are watching a Pirandello-esque behind-the-scenes doc about the making of The Souvenir, viewed through a kaleidoscopic maze of self-reflection. Just as Julie tells her tutors that she’s no longer interested in showing life “as it plays out” but rather “as I imagine it”, so Hogg also uses an audacious cinematic sleight of hand to conjure yet another movie-within-the-movie, revisiting events that we have previously seen portrayed with uncanny realism, but here reimagined as fantastical flights of fancy that owe a debt to the dreamy dance sequences of old-school Hollywood musicals. It’s a bold move, and one that invokes both Singin’ in the Rain and Fellini’s 8½ – not comparisons I thought I’d be making after reviewing The Souvenir. Yet watching parts I and II back to back (the first is conveniently available on BBC iPlayer), they do miraculously come together as a coherent whole, an adventurous meditation on the alchemical process of making life imitate art and vice versa. Hogg (who recently confessed to me her love of disaster movies) is currently working on a ghost story, her first foray into “genre” cinema.

2/6/2022,"Elizabeth Ann is poised to make history. The world’s first cloned black-footed ferret has just celebrated her first birthday and has reached an age when she can start to breed. And, if she is successful and produces healthy kits, the little predator will give a precious boost to attempts to save her seriously endangered species. However, scientists acknowledge that they will have to be extremely careful in screening possible mates for Elizabeth Ann, who is being kept at a conservation centre near Fort Collins, Colorado. In particular, the male they eventually select will have to display one key quality, they say: he will have to be gentle.  The black-footed ferret (Mustella nigripes) is not known for its sweet temper. Elizabeth Ann snarls at keepers who get too close, for example. However, the species is desperately in need of an injection of fresh genes and Elizabeth Ann can provide those, – as long as she survives the breeding encounter, say scientists. “When it comes to black-footed ferrets, the mating scenario can get a little rough and we don’t want Elizabeth Ann to be injured. She is precious,” Oliver Ryder, director of genetics conservation at San Diego Zoo, told the Observer. “So we need an experienced male who has already produced offspring and who is therefore not going to be infertile – a problem that affects many black-footed ferret males today. In addition, we will select him for his gentleness,” added Ryder who said that the choice of a partner for Elizabeth Ann was now “imminent”. The black-footed ferret is a slender, 60cm-long, grumpy predator with black marks on its face, feet and tail. It once inhabited huge swathes of the Great Plains of the United States, living off a menu that was made up mainly of prairie dogs, which are a type of ground squirrel. However, it was wiped out as farming spread across the central United States and, by the 1970s, it was thought to be extinct. Then one night in 1981, John Hogg, a Wyoming rancher, heard strange noises on his land and he uncovered a colony of black-footed ferrets. Wildlife biologists flocked to the ranch and have since used its animals to establish a ferret-breeding programme with the aim of re-establishing colonies in the US. However, only seven of the ferrets found on Hogg Ranch were able to breed. As a result, the black-foot population is heavily inbred, with each animal having a kinship with the others that falls between that of a sibling and a first cousin. Damaging mutations are now affecting the breeding population. An injection of fresh ferret genes is badly needed, and they can be provided by Elizabeth Ann. She is the product of tissue that had been taken from a female black-footed ferret called Willa decades ago. Her cells were preserved at San Diego’s Frozen Zoo, a storage facility where genetic materials – DNA, sperm, eggs, embryos and live tissue – from endangered animals is stored in liquid nitrogen. A few years ago, it was decided to use the same technology that was employed in Scotland to create Dolly the Sheep in 1996 to produce a clone of Willa. Her cells were used to generate embryos that were implanted into three domestic female ferrets. Two of the pregnancies failed, while the third surrogate mother had one stillborn offspring … and Elizabeth Ann, who is now thriving on a diet of hamsters at her Colorado home. Crucially, her DNA contains different versions of the genes that predominate in the breeding programme’s inbred ferrets, and this has raised hope that her offspring could significantly improve the genetic viability of black-footed ferrets. As Ryder puts it: “Elizabeth Ann is a treasure trove of genetic diversity as far as we are concerned.” In addition, plans are under way to create another batch of cloned black-footed ferrets – with the same aim: to boost the genetic diversity of the species and to halt its reproductive decline. “That’s the crux of the effort here,” said Ryder. “Can Elizabeth Ann pass along her genes to descendant generations of black-footed ferrets?” The story of Elizabeth Ann has important implications for all endangered species, added Ryder. “We should be banking cells now from all sorts of endangered animals because we are losing biodiversity, and gene pools of wild animals are shrinking. At least, if we have the cells, we could, in future, do for other species what we are hoping to do for the black-footed ferret with Elizabeth Ann.”",News/Science,Wanted: virile but gentle mate for the world’s first cloned black-footed ferret,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/06/wanted-virile-but-gentle-mate-for-the-worlds-first-cloned-black-footed-ferret
2/6/2022,"It feels, sometimes, as though the path to equality is not just rocky or steep but, instead, a Mario-style platform game where there are crocodiles lurking in the gaps and certain blocks are designed to explode when you step on them. An example: for all this country’s smiling efforts at inclusivity, for all its rainbows hurriedly printed on hoardings and coffee cups, the barriers preventing female same-sex couples from having a family are as high and wide as ever. For those who have avoided the haunted rollercoaster that is fertility treatment in the UK, either by luck or choice, here are the facts: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidelines state that funded access to IVF in England is available to women “who have not conceived after two years of regular unprotected intercourse or 12 cycles of artificial insemination (where six or more are by intrauterine insemination)”.  So, if a woman in an opposite-sex relationship tells her GP they have been “trying” for a baby for two years they can access NHS-funded IVF treatment immediately. If a woman in a same-sex relationship tells her GP they have been “trying”, through whatever turkey baster means necessary, 80% of local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs choose how to delegate NHS funding in England) still require them to have up to 12 rounds of IUI to prove they can’t get pregnant (an irony traditionally glossed over politely). IUI costs anywhere up to £1,600 per cycle at a private clinic, meaning that with fees it’s not unusual for a same-sex couple to have to spend £20,000 and a year in clinical care, monthly excuses to your boss so you can slip away mid-morning to lie dreadfully in terribly lit clinics, nurses asking you to, “Just pop your clothes on the chair,” before being eligible for NHS treatment. The money – which represents two-thirds of the average UK salary, cash that straight couples might be using to buy a flat, or a car, or a series of marvellous “babymoons” in advance of the birth of the child they conceived on the sofa after watching Normal People – is boggling and disturbing, and inhibitory for most. It’s not the same everywhere in the UK – . Throughout Scotland, which is centrally funded, all same-sex couples can have six donor insemination cycles followed by three full IVF cycles if needed. But in England, all 106 CCGs ration access to NHS-funded fertility treatment, with more than a quarter (the Fertility Network revealed) denying access to same-sex couples altogether. Just eight allow same-sex couples to have NHS-funded fertility treatment directly. Fairness is so often an unhelpful word – a plate of dry meat, picked to the gristle. Especially when it comes to childbearing and rearing, when so many of us are in danger of breaking our necks looking over a shoulder at what our peers have got, and how, and how much, and how happily, and with what ease. But it is a fact that people are restricted from fertility treatments depending on who they love and where they live, their postcode deciding whether or not a child will be born. These details, flagged by the Fertility Network and Stonewall, and couples like Megan and Whitney Bacon-Evans who plan to sue their local NHS over what they claim is “IVF discrimination”, is not just unfair, but darkly telling. Treatments that aren’t seen as life-saving are all rationed on the NHS, but the arbitrary criteria at play here inevitably shows us something, something about who is seen to matter more. The wild costs of conceiving a child, the £20,000 investment required before they’ve even stepped foot in John Lewis’s buggy department, means it’s ruled out as an option for many same-sex couples. Which means fewer queer families, more discrimination for LGBTQ+ people, and less change. IVF is an opportunity to help people who want children but are having trouble conceiving; an opportunity that has the potential to promote equality and refocus our too-narrow ideas of what a family can be. And wouldn’t that improve all of our lives? Wouldn’t it improve the lives of everybody, gay or straight, who has lived in a family, or is creating a new one of their own, or is deep in the slimy weeds of somebody else’s; a move to broaden the image and expectations of what a family looks like? Its shape, its genders, the way it got here, the home it made. Surely the traditional family unit has damaged as many people as it has supported – surely now is the time to invest in and celebrate families who are helping to show that the walls of that structure were not load bearing. That they can be knocked through and rearranged without the house falling down.

2/6/2022,"Johnny Marr calls himself “a lifer”. It’s a fair description of someone who started playing guitar in bands aged 13, founded the Smiths at 19, departed the band five years later, and went on to become an integral part of the sound of the Pretenders, Electronic, Modest Mouse and the Cribs. Latterly, Marr has contributed to soundtracks with Hans Zimmer, including the Billie Eilish song No Time to Die for last year’s Bond film, and made four solo albums. His latest is Fever Dreams Pts 1-4, a terrific, vigorous double album of 16 tracks that swoops from moody introspection to rousing anthems. So, yes, after 40 years in the business, it’s hard to deny Marr’s zeal and commitment. “When you get older, you learn that no matter whether your work is in or out of fashion, it’s all about whether you can stand behind it,” he says, “because you can’t do anything about the trends and fashions and the way you are perceived too much – that’s a really secondary load of baggage that just gets in the way. So there are definitely some advantages to the mentality of being older: you don’t really care too much about being liked, certainly not as much as how much you like the work.”  At 58, Marr is, you have to say, in indecently good nick: his eyes alert, his skin clear, his hair raven black. He hasn’t always lived the most temperate life, but he became a vegetarian in the mid-1980s, and he hasn’t had a drink or smoked for more than 20 years. Since he was a kid he’s been a ball of energy, but these days his release is running, and he has completed marathons in under four hours. Marr met his wife, Angie, when they were both teenagers, and they have two grown-up children. He is careful not to preach, but perched on a stool in a photo studio in north London, sipping green tea, he’s certainly an impressive advertisement for wholesome living. “It’s worth saying that if I thought that drugs and booze would make me a more interesting musician I would do it,” says Marr. “And I don’t go around skipping through cornfields, by any means; I have my issues just like anybody else. But it’d be tougher if I was a boozer, that’s for sure. I just don’t think it’s a particularly happening drug. I don’t think Bob Marley thought that either.” On the evidence of our shout-out for questions for this feature, there is clear affection for Marr, both from former collaborators and Observer readers. Not everyone, though, feels so well disposed. After our interview took place, his former Smiths bandmate Morrissey posted an “open letter” on his website asking Marr to stop talking about him in the press. “Move on,” the singer wrote. “It’s as if you can’t uncross your own legs without mentioning me. Our period together was many lifetimes ago, and a lot of blood has streamed under the bridge since then. There comes a time when you must take responsibility for your own actions and your own career, with which I wish you good health to enjoy. Just stop using my name as click-bait.” Marr, on Twitter, responded that open letters haven’t “really been a thing since 1953” and went on: “Also, this fake news business… a bit 2021 yeah?” And in fairness to him, Marr didn’t say the name Morrissey once in our 90-minute conversation. A couple of readers asked emotional questions about the Smiths, but his responses were thoughtful and measured, as you can judge below. As for Morrissey’s complaint that Marr doesn’t discuss his own solo work, Marr would probably much rather do that, but he knows that fans are still interested in the Smiths, and he seems to feel no compulsion to erase that period of his life. He would brush off the comparison, but Marr is almost entering Paul McCartney territory. Both men were blamed by many for the break-up of their iconic British bands; both have remained mostly tight-lipped about what went down and have relentlessly worked in the intervening decades to create new material that they know will inevitably be compared to their formative output. And both McCartney and Marr seem to be now enjoying a revisionist take on their lifetime in music. Has Marr seen Get Back, the Peter Jackson documentary series about the Beatles? “Yeah, amazing,” he replies. “There were so many things to take from it, little things. And that 50 years later Paul McCartney is exonerated almost. Really, really impressive. He kept a lid on a lot of things for whatever reasons. I think that’s really impressive.” Did any of that resonate with Marr? “Maybe, yeah,” he says with a wry smile. “No, I wouldn’t want to say that. I think Paul McCartney is out on his own dealing with a whole lot of different agendas on a world scale, on a historic scale. But he definitely seems to be such an impressive person because of how he’s just stayed human. He’s an absolute beacon for everyone. And, yeah, it does cross my mind quite often: if he can do it, anyone can, know what I mean?” Which song have you written that still gives you goosebumps? And which can’t you stand any more?Richard Hornby, Manchester I’ve always really liked That Joke Isn’t Funny Anymore by the Smiths. And Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me and The Headmaster Ritual. City of Bugs by the Cribs, Dashboard by Modest Mouse and Get the Message particularly by Electronic. I think it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done; almost my favourite, really. What sounds don’t I really like very much any more? I got tired of Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now pretty quick. As much for the music as anything else. What else? I know Reel Around the Fountain is a big, big song for some people, but I fell out of love with that fairly quick. I don’t want to ruin it for people but, yeah, those two songs I could live without. How has the global pandemic changed your sources of inspiration? I’ve just come out of this two-year period having made a double album. But to be honest, it was time for me to make a record anyway. I went into the pandemic with this idea for an album called Fever Dreams. I’d started a few songs already, but then broke off to do the James Bond movie. Then the pandemic started and I definitely didn’t want to make a lockdown record and be singing about the stores not being open and anti-vaxxers or any of that. But the psychology of that time and how it was affecting me and my thinking, and how that might be the same for my audience, fed into the album entirely. As someone who broke into music in their 40s, how do you navigate pushing forward in an industry that mostly values youth? I’m maybe being over-idealistic here, but I think that people or fans of music recognise an artist’s agenda and possibly their motivation. You can tell a lifer when you see them. And Sleaford Mods are a really good example of that. In a way, the fact that you can be still bothered with all the bullshit involved in a modern career says quite a lot about you, I think. It’s as simple as that. What do you think about being considered a fashion icon, particularly among some groups of current teenagers?Daisy, 22, Liverpool Well, these days, you just cross your fingers and hope for the best. Me and my sister got into clothes really young, like eight or nine. Growing up on a housing estate, it’s something to share and be in competition and get noticed and obsess about. And it’s never really left me. But it all comes from an interest in style and design, I think, not vanity. So I’m glad some people are noticing. Because otherwise, I’ve wasted a lot of my time. I heard you were collecting art long before the Smiths took off – is that true? Yeah, it is, but it was stuff from junk shops. The most valuable stuff was some Man Ray and David Bailey photographs that I picked up on an excursion to Covent Garden in this crappy little junk shop. But the first thing I got into when the Smiths took off was collecting books, buying first editions. People like Isherwood, Huxley, Bernard Shaw, Gurdjieff. It wasn’t anything to do with an investment; I just figured if I was going to educate myself, I might as well be holding a really nice artefact. Which painters have influenced your sound the most? I suppose it’s obvious, or obvious to me: Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, David Hockney, Cy Twombly, Paul Klee. With David Hockney, it’s a sense of being wide awake, his sense of inquiry and joy and curiosity. David Shrigley has got this sense of knowing about him, and he’s funny. I also think Tracey Emin is really deserving of her reputation. In some ways the noise around her persona gets in the way of the actual work sometimes. Maybe I can relate to that! Did the Smiths ever fall out over football or politics? We never discussed football so that’s that. And we never fell out over politics, but we probably would now. Morrissey’s recent political views have cast a shadow over the Smiths for me – reaching back into the past and tainting something that was very important to me. I’m so disappointed in him. Has it impacted how you feel about the Smiths or are you able to separate the past from the present, the band from the man? I find it very difficult to do so.Johnny Spence, Northern Ireland It hasn’t impacted how I feel about the Smiths. That’s all I can say about that. I’m certainly able to separate the past from the present. I don’t know whether you can separate the band from the man, but I can separate myself from the man and what I did, so when I do see how disappointed people are, it really does make me sad. But it’s completely out of my control. And I can only really do what is in my control. So I play Smiths songs for reasons that I think are real. And over the years I’ve tried to take care of the catalogue and the releases as much as I was able to. As I would have done anyway. So, you know, I see it the way everybody else sees it. I don’t have any answers. And I don’t want to have any answers. Where do you go to think? I go to a room in my house for half an hour in the morning and half an hour at night and meditate. I’ve done that for 20 years. It still doesn’t get any easier for anyone who’s thinking of taking it up, but it works, it does work. Most people use running to unwind, but for some reason, I just get more rewound and get a lot of ideas. I certainly don’t zone out. But, yeah, either meditating or running. We have both had many casual musical flings but one very strong personal bond in our lives. How has your relationship with the wonderful Angie influenced your creativity, and does she have a favourite guitar? I’ll answer the easy bit first: Angie’s always loved Les Pauls. That’s to do with when we first met – she was 14 and I was 15. We were into Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, so she became bit of a Gibson fan. I’ve had a Gold Top guitar for 20-odd years and I think if I’ve ever got rid of that one, she’d leave me. The important thing I can say about my relationship with Angie is that she made me brave at 15, 16. Not only did Angie know me before everybody else knew me, but she knew me before I knew myself. She was there before the Smiths started: it was me and Angie. And then when that whole thing got together, it was me and Angie and Joe Moss [the late manager of the Smiths]. Not only was I with my soulmate, but I was with somebody who was very smart and very talented. I feel that listening to the Smiths growing up and hearing your guitar playing was crucial to my understanding of the guitar and how to approach it, as I can imagine it was for many others. Who were your main influences growing up and what kind of techniques did they provide you with? Wow. Well, first off, it’s great to get a question from Lottie because she’s one of my favourite musicians to come out over the last few years. Whenever I hear a Goat Girl track and I don’t know it’s them, I’ll say to whoever I’m with: “I really like this, who’s this?” And it’s always Goat Girl; I should know by now. So I’m chuffed about that. The biggest influence on me would have to be Bert Jansch. When I was about 14, a friend of mine told me he’d got into this folk group called Pentangle. And I immediately thought: “Well, OK, I don’t need to know any more about that.” Anyway, when I was round at his house, he played me Basket of Light by Pentangle. And I couldn’t believe what I heard, especially from the guitar: it was jazzy, it was bluesy and kind of funky, it went off all over the place. I could see straight away that there are people who are influenced by Bert Jansch that don’t even know it. Anyone who got into Nick Drake – totally into Bert. Anyone who got into Led Zeppelin’s acoustic stuff, Neil Young, Donovan, therefore the Beatles. No Bert Jansch, no Back to the Old House, no Unhappy Birthday, even my electric stuff. So it runs all the way through what I was doing in the Smiths. All roads lead back to Bert Jansch. You really are a musical chameleon – would you ever consider becoming an actor? If so, what would be your preferred medium: film, TV or stage? I personally think you would be a natural. Do you know what, Maxine? Telly or film, I’m not fussy. I’d like to play a menacing, villainous eastern European gangster or a drug dealer. One or the other, as long as it’s not a fucking musician from Manchester in the 80s. That’s about the depth of my range. Or if Robert Downey Jr decides to retire I’ll just take his gig – got the same haircut. It’s apparent that you keep getting better and better with age. Can you speak to the role that removing alcohol from your life has played in that?Mike Shennan, Ontario, Canada Giving up alcohol has played a massive part in the last 20-odd years of my life, from day one. Without getting judgy, because people get very touchy about this shit, I can really recommend it. I’m not coming from a place of abstinence or a place of “my drink and drugs hell”, but for me, I just thought it was a shit drug, and other drugs were better. No, seriously, if anyone gave me a pill that would make me feel that shitty the next day and say such stupid things then I just wouldn’t be taking it. You’ve played on orchestral film soundtracks – do you ever listen to or take inspiration from classical guitar music? I don’t, to be honest, no. Whenever I’ve been recommended classical music – once or twice by Neil in fact – I’ve enjoyed it. But it’s just a little bit too formal for me. I like the guitar to do everything but formal. I’m aware that it can be dramatic and expressive, but whenever I’ve listened to Julian Bream or something like that, it has always felt just too stiff to me. I was at Glastonbury in 2019 when you played There Is a Light That Never Goes Out at the end of your set. Without wanting to sound too gushy and obsessive, men and women in their 40s and 50s were openly crying, I guess because it felt like you were giving us permission to love these songs again. What is going through your head when you perform these songs? Do you feel any sadness or regret, or do you feel that you are claiming them fresh, as yours?Lindsay Wright, London I’ve been asked about claiming the Smiths songs quite a lot before and I’m not doing that. Because I’m a musician, I’m thinking about joy and about giving people that I like something they love. I feel like their sort of leader, conducting everybody. Of course I’m aware that there’s a lot of different meanings going on for people, and I experience this huge wave of elation, there’s no doubt about it. After just a few seconds, I’m just joining along with everybody else really. It’s no deeper than that. But I don’t think I need to claim anything, because I wrote them. When you left the Smiths you said you’d like to be like Nils Lofgren. It was something I instantly understood, but could you explain to non-Nils fans what you meant? Never been asked that before; trust Bobby. My introduction to Nils Lofgren was in the 1970s and finding out that he was a young, hyperactive ace guitar player who had been brought in as a ringer for Neil Young’s Tonight’s the Night. He was little, like me, and a great singer. Then in the 80s, he was playing with Bruce Springsteen. So I guess really what Bobby was understanding was this idea of the ringer. I always found that really attractive: John McGeoch did it when he went from Magazine to the Banshees to Public Image; Ronnie Wood did it when he went from the Faces to the Rolling Stones. Nile Rodgers has done it with countless groups. And I was relating to that, really, as a way for me out of this shitstorm that was the Smiths split. You’ve recently collaborated with one of today’s most popular artists, Billie Eilish, on the brilliant track No Time to Die, which won a Grammy. Are you planning on doing another collaboration like this? I would love to see you work with Taylor Swift, who you recently tweeted about playing your signature Jaguar guitar!Paula, Malaga, Spain Well, I can’t think of one collaboration that I’ve done over 40 years that I went after. They all come about by being invited by always very interesting people. When me and my band were listening to Billie’s first record on the tour bus, I had no idea that I was going to be doing the Bond song with her that would get to No 1. So it’s quite likely that some other stuff is going to happen that I don’t know about. That window is always open for me, for whoever it is. My favourite track on your new album, Fever Dreams Pts 1-4, is Ariel. The music and the lyrics successfully mesh together with a convincing, almost dark intention. You have spoken about getting in touch with your “feminine side” on this album. Sylvia Plath, who wrote the astonishing collection of poems Ariel, and who you’ve said in interviews influenced this song, very much turned upside down the notion of “feminine” as it was understood in 1965. So I am interested to know how you embrace your “feminine side” in this new age of gender politics in 2022? Well, I was brought up with a sister who’s 11 months younger than me. And we are incredibly close. And I’ve been with my wife since I was 15. And I’ve got a daughter who’s now 27. As well as that, I’ve worked with some really amazing women like Chrissie Hynde and Kirsty MacColl. So it’s never really been too difficult to have an awareness of the life that the women around me might be living. I think there are a lot of men out in the world right now who are really enjoying the opportunity to be part of a change. It’s an exciting time of, hopefully, enlightenment. Now I’m aware that plenty of people might scoff at that and think I’m being naive, but speak for yourself! But I’m really glad Pauline clicked with Ariel, because if that’s coming across, that’s good, because it’s there. You once told me that your unique guitar style was just “Martin Carthy licks sped up”. How influential was traditional folk music on your development as a musician? Well, to follow on from Lottie’s question, because of that introduction to Bert, you then need to know about Davey Graham and Martin Carthy. This was just before punk, and compared with the heavy rock that my mates were getting into, the more radical folk stuff just sounded much more interesting and tougher and less straight to me. But “Martin Carthy sped up” is actually quite a good way of describing what I was doing, with the equipment of the Patti Smith Group. The idea of folk music played through punk gear was really modern, but – I also should insert here – with the chord changes of the girl groups. My technique was folk playing, but harmonically I was going for Phil Spector music, with gear that my peers were using. Which book has had the biggest impact on you and why? Sarah Corbyn, Essex I’d say The Outsider by Colin Wilson, because it’s the ultimate explanation of a certain kind of mindset that I’ve had, that I’ve recognised in myself from being a kid and maybe even a predicament sometimes in my own thinking, my own life. Or The Bhagavad Gita, which Chrissie Hynde introduced me to, because you can read it and read it and read it, and then keep doing it for thousands of lifetimes. Johnny, the world is in a big mess but me and some of my equally defiant mates are determined to make a last stand for life. We will probably end up on a muddy hill surrounded by those who just don’t care. Facing such odds, will you be willing to provide the rallying song to stir our hearts in the time of ultimate darkness? No pressure there then! I think even if I was to be ambitious enough to try and tackle a song on a big level, if it happened, it would be by accident. The last song on the new album, Human, is the closest I’ve got to writing something like that. It’s the most stirring song I’ve written myself on my own. But now I think of it, I’d either do it by accident or, yeah, I’ll try and accept the challenge! Johnny, out of 10 what would you give me for my turn as Mozzer on Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes? [Hill sang This Charming Man.] PS: if you and the fellas ever decide to regroup and his nibs won’t play ball, I still have the wig – and more importantly, the hearing aid. I sort of remember that. I’m going to have to give Harry a solid two out of 10 for that, and he can make of that what he will. As for the offer, I don’t even know what to make of that…! What are you most looking forward to in 2022?Gemma Faulkner, London Well, the obvious thing is playing concerts. Human contact. I’m very fortunate that in my life I have strangers say hello to me on the street. And plenty of them just say “Hi” and walk on – they don’t need to do selfies or anything like that. There was a time probably leading up to the pandemic that I was a little overwhelmed with selfies. And after a couple of years, I’m not saying: everybody come and take a selfie – but I’m looking forward to human contact on a large scale.

2/6/2022,"A leading medical charity has warned there is “insufficient evidence” for the use of £70 airways suction devices that are promoted online for saving children’s lives when they are choking. The suction-based devices are already used in care homes across the country and there is a campaign for them to be more widely available, but emergency doctors are concerned that families may be misled by some of the promotional material. They say there is a lack of objective research demonstrating that they are effective and warn they may delay other life-saving treatment.  In its latest advice, Resuscitation Council UK, a charity that develops guidelines for health and care professionals, says the recommended treatment for choking includes back blows and abdominal thrusts. It acknowledges there are a number of suction-based airway clearance devices available in the UK, but says: “There is insufficient evidence on the safety or effectiveness of these devices for us to recommend their use, and we are concerned that the use of these devices could delay established treatments for choking.” There are about 300 deaths a year in the UK from choking, with most of the deaths among elderly people. The suction devices were mainly developed in the US and their use is widely based on case reports rather than any clinical trials. They are intended for use when other efforts to remove a blockage in an airway have failed. The two main brands of device, LifeVac and Dechoker, are registered in the UK as medical devices. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has advised the companies that the devices should only be used by healthcare professionals or people with advanced life support training. It also says the devices should not be marketed for use on children. LifeVac Europe, which is based in the UK and is one of the leading companies in this sector, promotes its device for saving children’s lives around the world. Its Facebook page and UK website last week included anecdotal evidence of toddlers’ lives being saved by a LifeVac, including a three-year-old who was choking on a chicken nugget. The company is on a drive to convince regulators to relax the current restrictions in the UK, which it says do not apply in other countries. It denies the devices would delay other treatments because it says they are only intended to be used when all other efforts have failed and death is imminent. The company said last week it did not market its devices for children. Its devices are available online from a number of distributors, but the company says it asks buyers to confirm they are healthcare professionals or have advanced life support training before purchase. It also pointed out that children’s masks for the device were not sold to UK buyers, and said that research in peer-reviewed medical publications had demonstrated the effectiveness of the device in real-life situations. Dechoker UK does not promote its device in the UK for use on children. It said it considered more research was required on the efficacy of the devices, but pointed out there was also almost no clinical evidence on the effectiveness of back blows or abdominal thrusts for choking. It said it only sells its devices for use by care providers. A review on the effectiveness of anti-choking suction devices published in the medical journal Resuscitation in February 2020 said there were “many weaknesses in the data” in the research examining the use of such devices and “few unbiased trials” that have tested their effectiveness. The MHRA said LifeVac and Dechoker were registered with the agency and had agreed that the medical devices should not be used on children or marketed for that use. It said it was the responsibility of a manufacturer to ensure a device was marketed in line with its intended use. A spokesperson said: “If a user or member of the public has any concerns regarding the compliance of a specific medical device available on the UK market, we would ask that they report this to the MHRA.”",News/Society,Warning over use of anti-choking suction devices on children,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/warning-over-use-of-anti-choking-suction-devices-on-children
2/6/2022,"“This is white people doing it to white people, so y’all gonna fight amongst yourselves.” Whoopi Goldberg’s comments on ABC’s The View about the Holocaust being not “about race” but “white on white” violence that exposed “man’s inhumanity to man” has drawn a slew of condemnation. She quickly put out an apology and, quoting Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who pointed out that “the Holocaust was about the Nazi’s systematic annihilation of the Jewish people – who they deemed to be an inferior race”, she wrote: “I stand corrected.” Goldberg was not denying the Holocaust or the gravity of the catastrophe that befell Jewish people. The discussion was about a Tennessee school board that had removed from the curriculum Maus, a graphic novel about the Shoah. Goldberg mocked the censors for being more concerned about nudity and bad language than about the reality of genocide.  This is what should really trouble us about Goldberg’s views – that someone who acknowledges the depth of the tragedy and wants to educate people about the Holocaust should so misunderstand it. Goldberg’s comments tell us something about the way we look at racism (and at Jews) in the present. They also tell us something about what we’ve forgotten about racism in the past. Racism today is viewed primarily through the lens of “whiteness” and of “white privilege”. It is something that white people dish out. And something from which non-whites suffer (unless you’re an Asian-American, in which case you are deemed to be almost white). Jews today are seen as white and privileged and so incapable of being victims of racism. It’s a perspective that has led some on the left to become blind to antisemitism. It’s also led many, like Goldberg, to deny the relationship between racism and the Holocaust. So deep does the elision of racism and whiteness run that even the ADL, a leading Jewish organisation, defined racism as “the marginalization and/or oppression of people of color based on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people”. In the wake of the Goldberg controversy, the ADL changed to an “interim” definition. In a mea culpa blog post, Greenblatt acknowledged that its own understanding of racism had been “so narrow” that it had “alienated many people who did not see their own experience encompassed in this definition, including many in the Jewish community”. Goldberg’s comments illuminate not just the contemporary view of Jews but also the amnesia that exists about the historical use of racial categories. Race has never been simply about black and white. It’s a concept that has been used to deem certain people biologically incapable or unworthy of being equal. Over the past 200 years, not just black or Jewish people, but Irish, Slavs, even the working class have, at various times, been viewed as racially distinct and inferior. Defining a group as a distinct race became a means of justifying the practice of unequal treatment – that is, of racism. Given the controversy over Jimmy Carr’s routine, it’s worth remembering that the Roma were also seen as an inferior race, fit only for extermination. Defining a group as a distinct race became a means of justifying the practice of unequal treatment – that is, of racism. And of genocide, too. Ironically, given Goldberg’s views, there was a deep relationship between the Nazis’ treatment of Jews and American treatment of black people. Before the Holocaust, the key Nazi edicts that formalised the racial distinction between Aryans and Jews were the 1935 Nuremberg laws. These established that a “citizen is exclusively a national of German blood”, that Jews were not of “German blood” and that marriages and “extramarital intercourse” were forbidden between “Jews and citizens of German or racially related blood”. In 1934, the Nazi justice minister, Franz Gürtner, convened a special meeting to work out how to formulate a legal distinction between Aryan and Jew. They found their most useful source in America, whose racial concepts both intrigued and excited them. They were intrigued because a nation built on the idea of equality nevertheless was suffused with laws and practices that denied such equality on racial grounds. And they were excited because US law had managed to circumvent a problem with which the Nazis were wrestling: how to define racial distinctions in law when in science such distinctions seemed impossible to delineate. Nazi leaders, James Q Whitman notes in his book Hitler’s American Model, “regarded America, not without reason, as the innovative world leader in the creation of racist law”. “The dominant political ideology in the USA,” Herbert Kier wrote in an article in the 1934 National Socialist Handbook for Law and Legislation, was “liberal and democratic”. “With an ideology of that kind, which starts from the fundamental proposition of the equality of everything with a human countenance,” Kier continued, “it is all the more astonishing how extensive race legislation is in the USA.” He listed 30 US states that “forbid mixed marriages between white and colored races” and seemed astounded that races were segregated “even in prisons”. Heinrich Krieger, the most important Nazi scholar of American law, observed that Americans had created racial distinctions through “artificial line-drawing”. The problem the Nazis were debating – how to deal with “mongrels” or mixed-race individuals – was not an issue in the US. The “one-drop rule” – the belief that one drop of black blood made you unwhite – allowed Americans to create “two population groups: whites and coloreds” and arbitrarily assign people to one or other. Every US state, another lawyer, Roland Freisler, pointed out, had a different definition of what constituted “coloured”. Why, he wondered, should not German law also simply distinguish between Aryans and coloureds? “Every judge,” he reasoned, “would reckon the Jews among the coloureds, even though they look outwardly white.” The American south was not Nazi Germany, and however brutal the apartheid laws and racial terror that defined the Jim Crow era, it was not the precursor to mass extermination. Nevertheless, in recognising the distinctiveness of the Jewish Holocaust, we should also acknowledge the similarities in the racial ideas that permeated Nazi Germany and other western nations. Not to do so would be as misguided as failing to recognise the racial roots of the Holocaust. ABC has temporarily suspended Goldberg. It’s difficult to know why. Her comments were ill-considered, but spoken not out of malice but from a common misunderstanding about race. Too many in authority seem more eager to be seen punishing people for saying the wrong thing than in creating the conditions for a public conversation that can provide greater clarity.

2/6/2022,"Over the years, Damien Hirst has faced more than one accusation of copying someone else’s work, with artists variously claiming to have created his diamond skull, his medicine-cabinets and his spin-paintings before he did. The one-time enfant terrible of the British art world has always denied plagiarism, although he did go as far as saying in an interview in 2018 that “all my ideas are stolen anyway”. Now he is facing fresh allegations. His cherry blossom paintings in his latest exhibition, which has just closed in Paris, have prompted outrage from the English artist and writer Joe Machine, who says they look just like his own cherry blossom paintings.  “I saw Hirst’s cherry blossom paintings and, for a moment, I thought I was looking at my own paintings,” Machine told the Observer. “His [work] is so very similar to mine. But I was doing my cherry blossom paintings years before his.” While acknowledging that Hirst’s paintings are not direct copies, he argued that “the very dark branches, the powder-blue skies and the blotches of pink blossom” are too similar to be a coincidence. After three years’ work, Hirst finished his Cherry Blossom series in November 2020 and the paintings will be exhibited in Japan from next month. Hirst has said that the exhibition’s subject matter was inspired partly by a memory of his mother painting a cherry tree in blossom when he was three or four. But Charles Thomson, the artist and co-founder of the Stuckists, an international group campaigning for traditional artistry, did a double-take when he first saw Hirst’s paintings: “I thought they were Joe’s – and then I realised they were Hirst’s. If people see Joe’s work, they’re going to think he’s copied Hirst.” He added: “Joe has made and displayed cherry blossom paintings since 2006. Hirst’s, in a similar style, were started in 2017. The overall appearance is similar – a structure of brown branches, vivid pink blossoms against clear blue sky. Both their paintings are not intended to be botanical studies, but use ‘splodges’ of paint to give an impression of blossom.” Thomson has conducted extensive research into Hirst, who won the Turner prize in 1995 and made his name with creations featuring dead sharks and cows. In 2010, Thomson described him as “a plagiarist in a way that would be totally unacceptable in science or literature”, having published a list of 15 plagiarism claims by fellow artists in The Jackdaw art magazine. They included one from Lori Precious, who arranged butterfly wings into mandala patterns before Hirst. Her butterflies had sold for £6,000 against Hirst’s version for £4.7m. In 2000, Hirst paid an undisclosed sum to head off legal action for breach of copyright by the designer and makers of a £14.99 anatomical toy, which bore a resemblance to his 20ft bronze sculpture, Hymn. Machine’s paintings have been shown in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, among other venues, and he wonders whether Hirst saw his blossom paintings at the now-closed Tramshed, Shoreditch, where Hirst’s pickled animals in a massive vitrine, Cock and Bull, was a centrepiece. Referring to Hirst’s admission to “stealing” other people’s ideas, Machine said: “It’s not a joke to me. He might be able to be flippant about it, but I don’t steal other people’s work. I’m incensed.” Machine began painting cherry blossom as a response to his “criminal past”. “They’re a way of bringing beauty into my life.” He spoke openly of a violent upbringing in which he was exposed to stabbings and pub fights from an early age. He abandoned a life of crime years ago after becoming a father, he said. “No one ever taught me how to paint. It was my way of dealing with my own past. My involvement with art certainly saved my life. I would have ended up in prison or dead otherwise.” Hirst’s cherry blossom paintings have reportedly sold for up to about £2.5m. Machine’s sell for up to £10,000. David Lee, editor of The Jackdaw, said: “Where plagiarism is concerned, Hirst has a very long rap sheet. He’s even admitted to it, so it’s hard to give him the benefit of the doubt on any new occasion. Hirst’s versions look as though he may well have seen Machine’s pictures and the idea lodged in his suggestible head.” Hirst’s representatives were approached but declined to comment.",Arts/Art and design,‘Damien Hirst stole my cherry blossom’: artist faces plagiarism claim number 16 ,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/06/damien-hirst-stole-my-cherry-blossom-artist-faces-plagiarism-claim-number-16-joe-machine
