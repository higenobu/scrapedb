4/1/2022,"Passengers expecting delays at UK airports this Easter holiday are taking extra precautions including arriving early, with some even staying in nearby hotels the night before they fly. Sallyanne Glynn, 52, decided to stay in a hotel near Heathrow with her family the night before a flight to New York to celebrate her daughter’s 21st birthday, at a cost of £1,000. “It was to make things easier for us,” she said. “I don’t think anybody is back to normal yet. The airport is a huge operation with thousands of staff and you can’t just switch that on and off.” Airports are expecting a huge surge in passenger numbers as people jet off on longed-for Easter breaks after the lifting of Covid travel restrictions. Travel company Tui said demand was “strong” for school holiday getaways. Hays Travel also said it was “very busy” for overseas departures over Easter. Many airports have ramped up recruitment after layoffs during the pandemic and other staff leaving during the so-called Great Resignation have resulted in shortages. With a tight and competitive labour market, airports are struggling to fill vacancies. Heathrow has deployed extra colleagues to help people get on their way as quickly and smoothly as possible, in expectation of passenger numbers “not seen since early March 2020”. Manchester airport, which is reopening its second runway next Tuesday, said it was working to put measures in place. A spokesperson said that during the pandemic the airport saw a reduction of about 25% in staff numbers and that it began a “bumper” recruitment drive in January to “fill hundreds of roles in its security operation”. The airport’s partner organisations, such as airlines and ground handlers, have also been recruiting. Stansted began a major recruitment drive in January. It has teamed up with Tottenham Hotspur football club to hold a jobs fair at their stadium next Tuesday. A spokesperson advised passengers to leave plenty of time to get to the airport and through the checks and to be aware of all security restrictions before leaving home. At Heathrow, passengers at its Terminal 5 last week complained about “quarter-mile-long” queues at immigration. Environment minister Richard Benyon, who was caught in the delays, called it a “shambles”. A spokesperson for the Home Office, which is responsible for UK Border Force, said it was “clear that queue times may be longer” with the reopening of international travel and a rise in passenger numbers. It said it was working to “ensure passengers have the smoothest possible journey” including deploying its staff flexibly. Problems at Heathrow continued when a technical issue with British Airways on Wednesday left passengers affected by long delays, with some cancellations. The airline said the IT failure was resolved by the afternoon. However, there was a knock-on effect, with “a reduction in schedule” on Thursday compounded by bad weather. British Airways said it had offered refunds, hotel accommodation and refreshment vouchers, or to rebook people on alternative flights where needed. At Gatwick, where the second of two terminals reopened last weekend after 21 months, a spokesperson said there were no staffing issues but added that the terminals “may be busy during peak periods, such as weekends and the Easter holidays”. DAA International, a subsidiary of the company responsible for Cork and Dublin airports, said it too was working on “recruitment, training and necessary background checks” to address the issue of long queues and disruption. But a spokesperson said these processes take several weeks. Passengers, perhaps out of practice at taking flights, have been advised to check their airline’s guidelines and to refamiliarise themselves with security rules including those on carrying liquids in hand luggage. Meanwhile, a report published this week by industry trade body the Airport Operators Association (AOA) found that “UK airports lost £10bn in revenue since the first lockdown in March 2020 and have taken on more than £4bn in debt”. It added that 2021 was worse than 2020 with UK airports seeing “the lowest passenger numbers since 1983”. It called for more help from the UK and devolved governments and a “comprehensive aviation recovery plan”. Airports in Germany, Italy, Ireland and the US got up to eight times as much financial support as UK airports did, the trade body said. Karen Dee, chief executive of the AOA, said that while airports have been preparing for the return of greater numbers of people travelling, “at peak times passengers may not have the experience they are used to”. Unite national officer Oliver Richardson said an overhaul was needed to make the industry more resilient. “The problems facing airline passengers are set to get worse,” he said. “The model that the aviation sector operates on is broken and unless it becomes more attractive for potential employees it won’t be able to recruit the workforce that is needed to meet demand as flights steadily increase.”",News/Business,UK holidaymakers brace for delays at airports this Easter,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/01/uk-holidaymakers-airport-delays-easter
4/1/2022,"An eight-month-old baby girl snoozes in her pram while her mother, in those precious moments of quiet, counts the cost of feeding her four young children. A 16p increase in the price of chicken drumsticks has put them beyond her reach. “What my children eat – it’s too expensive. The cost of living has changed,” she said, in interview room four of Bolton’s Citizens Advice bureau. “Chicken drumsticks, they used to sell them for £1.49 – it’s now £1.65. And the bus pass as well. From my house it used to be £2. It’s now £3 … A £1 [increase] – that’s a lot.” Down the corridor, another woman looks flustered when she learns that gas, electricity and water bills will rise sharply this month. “More?! They will go up?!” she cries. This is the frontline of Britain’s cost of living crisis. The advisers who help low-income families say they are now out of answers. “Historically, our staff have got so many tricks and tools but now we’re running out of road. For some people there’s literally nothing we can do,” said Richard Wilkinson, the chief executive of the Bolton and Bury branch of Citizens Advice. In the past three months, his team has directed 706 people to crisis support such as emergency food parcels and fuel vouchers – a 31% increase from the previous quarter. Nationally, Citizens Advice referred 24,752 people to food banks or to other charitable support in March, up by 44% on the same time last year. The latest research, conducted before the April increase, found one in five people in Bolton were unable to afford their energy bills even if they cut back on other essentials. That will rise to one in three people when bills skyrocket this month. “One in three or four people we see now are stating that they need help with food or fuel,” said Robert West, a debt adviser. “It sounds like that is the exception but it’s the norm. These are daily occurrences now.” The Bolton bureau has a twice-weekly drop-in day where people get advice on debt, housing, immigration or other money problems. Within an hour of the doors opening at 10am on Thursday, the waiting room is packed to standing room only. Based in a rundown former abattoir in Bolton town centre, the office feels nearly as cold as the streets outside. The tenor of the conversations is quiet and desperate. The small team of specialist advisers are trained to help people who are suicidal. They often see people at their lowest ebb. Some come in surrounded by all their belongings after being made homeless, often through no fault of their own, says Gemma Walsh, the housing manager. “I’ve had to tell people that [the council] are not going to accommodate you – go find a tent. We say stop here until we shut because it’s warm but then they’re off. That’s probably the worst-case scenario.” In interview room one, Salma* clasps a bundle of energy bills as she explains how her previously comfortable life was upended when her husband, a chef, had a stroke four years ago. Now they rely on universal credit and disability benefits. British Gas is threatening to refer her to a debt collection agency and install a pre-payment meter due to an unpaid £395 bill. Her husband is diabetic and could become seriously ill if they cannot afford to refrigerate his insulin. Their 12-year-old son has noticed they are struggling. “My child is upset when he sees my debt. He wants the same as his friends … everybody is struggling.” In another room, an Indian woman told the Guardian she had started skipping meals so she could feed her 14-year-old son. “One day I eat, one day I don’t,” she said. “My son says: ‘Mum, is there any food?’” Her problems spiralled after submitting immigration paperwork 16 days late, meaning her universal credit was stopped and she had to quit work as a cleaner. “My friends say if you’re hungry we will give you food but we can’t pay the bills,” she said. Bolton has some of the most deprived streets in England but the borough as a whole is not one of the poorest. About one in seven of its households were defined as experiencing fuel poverty in 2019, similar to the UK average, according to government data, but that figure will soar as bills rise. The effect will be felt unevenly among Bolton’s 285,000 residents as it will across the country: in the south-east of the borough 41% of children are in poverty – double the rate just a few miles away. In February, 524 people sought the Bolton centre’s help with fuel debt – up 33% on the previous year. West started as a debt adviser during the financial crash of 2008. He has noticed a shift in people’s quality of life in recent years as people sacrifice food and internet subscriptions yet still cannot make ends meet. “People have already fully budgeted their salary to points we would never have advised.” The lifeline for many in Bolton is a Christian charity called Urban Outreach. Operating from a 17,500 sq ft warehouse, its army of 350 volunteers has delivered 248,000 food parcels since the pandemic began. Over the Easter holidays, it will provide about 1,000 lunches a day for children entitled to free school meals. The charity tops up pay-as-you-go energy cards for people with pre-payment meters on behalf of the council. In winter 2019-20, it put £27,000-worth of gas and electricity on these cards. This winter, due to a surge in people needing council help, that had risen nearly seven-fold to £181,000. “That gives you some idea of the movement this winter before we see the cataclysmic rise in April,” said Dave Bagley, the chief executive. “Goodness knows what will happen now.” At the bureau, Wilkinson fears for the year ahead. His dwindling team of advisers are handling a “tsunami of demand” with fewer resources. Staff nationwide are leaving due to poor pay and low morale. With an average salary of £23,000, the people helping those in dire straits are also suffering. “It can’t really get much worse and it looks like it’s going to,” he said.

4/1/2022,"“Are y’all ready for Freddie Gibbs?” asks a voice on stage, before the rapper appears above a luminous sea of phones. He hits the ground running, with a rapid-fire flow that starts an audience chant of “Freddie! Freddie!” The 39-year-old from Gary, Indiana, put in the hard yards to get to medium-sized venues and the US Top 20 (with the album Alfredo in 2020), self-releasing mixtapes until finally getting signed. Nine albums in (some with collaborators such as Madlib and the Alchemist), the dishonourably discharged former US soldier (he was caught smoking marijuana) has a reputation for gruffly hard-hitting lyrics and gangsta rap stylings over imaginative beats. A charismatic performer – who resembles the late Tupac Shakur – he has tasted the “darker paths” he raps about, including a drive-by shooting from which he escaped unharmed. His gruff, breathless delivery is most startling when the music stops and his words hurtle undiluted from the stage. In the absence of Madlib, DJ/rapper Ralph supplies soulful laptop backing and vocals, and functions as the hapless butt of Gibbs’s mockery. “Turn his mic off!” the rapper jokes, the banter offering a lighter contrast to the material. The rapper smiles with delight as he sees a topless fan has his name tattooed across his back, although a promise to “get you up here later” goes unfulfilled. Gibbs’s constant yells of “fuck police” play well with a young, mostly male audience but get wearying, and even in the context of hip-hop storytelling there are a lot of “bitches” in the lyrics. Gangsta rap faded after the 90s yet the lives remain, and Gibbs is unreconstructed but real. It is hard to deny the bleak power of Deeper (man gets out of jail to find his girlfriend pregnant), couplets such as “The revolution is the genocide / Yeah, my execution might be televised”, or the killer tunes of Thuggin’ and Gang Signs. Gibbs’s refusal to comply with rap’s shift into aspiration or introspection makes huge crossover success unlikely, but with the house chanting his name, he seems entirely happy where he is.

4/1/2022,"Pat Fahy has not had a winner from 35 starters in Britain since Quadco took the Champion Bumper at Aintree in April 2000, but the bare stats do not tell the full story, as most were running at the fiercely-competitive spring Festivals and he has rattled the woodwork on several occasions. Fahy has two live contenders for the Scottish Grand National at Ayr on Saturday in Stormy Judge (3.35) and History Of Fashion, and the seven-year-old grey is an excellent bet at around 9-1 to capture the £85,000 first prize for his small County Carlow stable. Stormy Judge jumped impeccably in the Leinster National at Naas last month, when he was racing off Saturday’s mark of 139, and Danny Mullins hit the front two out before paying for his rapid move into contention in the closing stages. Mullins will surely put that experience to good use on Saturday and the step up to a marathon trip should also bring further improvement from Stormy Judge, whose half-brother Mister Fogpatches was a close third for the Fahy stable 12 months ago. Ayr 1.15: Sebastopol is the likely favourite here after a comfortable win at Kempton last time, but his overall strike-rate is underwhelming and Malystic looks a better bet. He was still going well when unseating his rider five out at Doncaster last month, his first start since April 2021, and champion-elect Brian Hughes is back in the saddle. Newbury 1.35: Royaume Uni, one of several progressive novices in this field, posted a career-best with something to spare at Fontwell last time and is just 6lb higher in the weights here. Ayr 1.50: Sounds Russian has progressed rapidly since getting off the mark over fences at Sedgefield in December and the form of his 22-length win at Kelso in February was backed up by a useful time. Newbury 2.10: The 12-year-old First Figaro has looked as good as ever since returning from 11 months off in March and can claim a third straight win from what remains a workable mark on his best form. Ayr 2.25: Course-and-distance winner Alqamar was still going well when he parted company with Charlotte Jones at Wetherby in October and runs off the same mark here. He has run well in the past and looks the pick of the prices at around 12-1. Newbury 2.45: Few in a tightly-knit field of 16 can be ruled out with any confidence so it may pay to write off Marsh Wren’s disappointing run last time as down to the trip, the ground or both. Stuart Edmunds’s mare was a 12-length winner of her previous start and is a fair each-way bet at around 20-1 with many firms offering five places.

4/1/2022,"Criminal and civil investigations have been launched into the conduct of P&O Ferries after the operator summarily sacked nearly 800 crew without notice or consultation. The Insolvency Service said it had “initiated both formal criminal and civil investigations” into the circumstances of the redundancies, after making inquiries at the request of the government. The move was confirmed in a letter to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who tweeted that he and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, would “continue to follow this matter closely as the investigations progress”. Following my letter to the Insolvency Service last week, formal criminal and civil investigations into P&O Ferries have now commenced.Transport Secretary @GrantShapps and I will continue to follow this matter closely as the investigations progress. pic.twitter.com/CdtInufaIS The announcement comes after Shapps appeared to admit court action would not be taken by the government, back tracking on an earlier statement by the prime minister, Boris Johnson. The move will be welcomed by MPs on all sides who had urged the government to not let P&O escape without sanction for choosing to break the law. P&O Ferries chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, admitted last week in an extraordinary Commons hearing that there was “absolutely no doubt we were required to consult with the unions … We chose not to do that.” The firm laid off 786 crew on British contracts issued out of Jersey, telling them that they were being replaced by cheap agency workers with immediate effect, and imposing a deadline for them to accept a compensation payoff while forfeiting the right to legal action. All but one of the sacked crew had accepted by yesterday’s deadline. A spokesperson for the business department Beis said: “Today the Insolvency Service has confirmed it has commenced formal criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances surrounding the recent appalling behaviour of P&O Ferries, following the Business Secretary asking they undertake a thorough review. “We will not provide further comment while investigations are ongoing.” More details to follow …",News/Business,P&O Ferries: criminal investigation launched after staff sackings,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/01/po-ferries-criminal-investigations-launched-after-staff-sackings
4/1/2022,"When I’m in the mood for a long weekend bake, brioche beckons. The dough really benefits from a slow rise in the fridge and, because it contains a lot of butter, a colder dough is much easier to work with. Once baked, the soft buns are filled to the brim with a thick banana custard that, I’ll be honest, is good enough to eat on its own, sans bun. You’ll need to prepare the dough and infused milk the day before you plan to serve. Prep 1 hrRise 4 hrRest OvernightCook 25 minMakes 10 buns For the brioche400g strong white bread flour60g caster sugar½ tsp salt7g fast-action yeast4 large eggs, plus extra for the egg wash30ml milk180g unsalted butter, softened For the banana custard3 small bananas, peeled and sliced450ml whole milk250ml double cream1½ tsp vanilla bean paste4 egg yolks60g caster sugar30g cornflour¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg5 tbsp dark rum (optional)Icing sugar, to finishThe day before, gently warm the bananas and milk in a saucepan, then cover, leave to cool to room temperature and chill overnight. Also the day before, make a start on the brioche. Put the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl, make a well in the centre and add the eggs and milk. Knead with a stand mixer for eight to 10 minutes, until the dough just comes together, then add the butter in three batches, making sure each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Knead for five minutes, until the dough is glossy and stops sticking to the sides of the bowl, then transfer to a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave for one and a half to two hours, until well risen. Transfer to the fridge and let the dough have a slow, cold rise overnight. The next day, turn out the dough on to a lightly floured surface and divide into 10 equal pieces. Roll each one into a tight ball and put on two lined baking trays. Cover and leave to rise for an hour or two, until they look puffy (this may take longer if your kitchen is quite cool). Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Brush the buns with egg wash and bake for 18-22 minutes, until golden; they should sound hollow when tapped underneath. For the banana custard, strain the chilled milk mix into a saucepan and discard the fruit solids. Add 100ml cream and the vanilla, and heat gently until steaming. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour, then add the hot milk in three batches. Transfer everything back into the pan, set over a medium heat and whisk until the custard is thick. Pour into a clean bowl, cover the surface with a sheet of clingfilm, cool to room temperature, then chill. Once cold, whisk the custard to remove any lumps. In a clean bowl, whip the remaining 150ml cream to stiff peaks, then fold into the custard. Cut the buns in half without slicing all the way through. Brush the insides with rum, if using, then spoon in the banana custard. Top with grated nutmeg, dust with icing sugar and serve.

4/1/2022,"If the news about Ukraine has left you feeling sad and scared, you’re not alone. What’s known as “nuclear anxiety” has been around since the second world war – from the late 1950s (when the threat loomed so large that Kellogg’s gave away “atomic submarines” in Corn Flakes), to five years ago when North Korea began testing missiles. Can the past show us how to deal with it today? I asked historian Taras Young, author of Apocalypse Ready, which explores the ways governments ask citizens to handle disasters. I’m already feeling better just talking to you, because it gives me perspective: we’ve been through this before, we can get through it again.People fall into one of two camps. They either grew up thinking about it, worrying about it, or they just ignored it. My folks never seemed to worry. So it comes down to the individual. The thing is, we still don’t know how much of a toll nuclear anxiety takes. A Finnish study found teens who worried about the Gulf war were more prone to depression later. But another study said it was the level of worry that mattered, and that a bit of concern was normal and had no lasting effect.The Home Office commissioned a report in 1981, which is one of the few times the government has looked into the psychological side of things. It said that when you imagine people panicking, you’re picturing cars queueing up to get out of the city. That’s not panic. That’s a rational response, because you’re trying to get away from the threat. So wait, the people trying to book bomb shelters right now are just being rational? No wonder Greater Manchester council advised people in the 80s to deal with anxiety by discussing how life might change post-apocalypse over a game of cards.That would be good advice if the bomb was about to drop but there was no imminent threat. Panic sets in when people don’t have enough information, but also when there’s too much. The location of bunkers is probably towards the “too much information” end. But in our 24-hour news cycle, too much information is hard to avoid.Mainlining news all day is very bad for you. So true. But short of ignoring the whole thing, I’m not sure how anyone could avoid feeling shaken.According to that Home Office report from 1981, the only people who would not be affected would be the 1% it estimated were psychopaths, who would generally be intelligent and rational. The author of that report separately said psychopaths might be the people who could take charge after a nuclear disaster. The Home Office seeing upsides to emotionlessness explains a lot about its current position on refugees. But I’ve always been a believer in the power of unfettered joy in times of anguish. And don’t forget meditation. I have a theory that one of the reasons eastern practices have boomed recently is because of stuff such as war anxiety and climate doom.The same thing happened in the 60s. And in the 80s: when people started realising the futility of nuclear war, there was a culturally fun response – satire, music, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, that kind of thing. So what you’re saying is history wants me to do some yoga and then hit the clubs? Well, who am I to argue? Thanks Taras, it’s good to understand that a bit of worry isn’t anything to worry about.Cheers, Coco.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How do you cope with nuclear anxiety?

4/1/2022,"There is a longstanding and compelling argument that a significant proportion of people who tune into showbiz awards ceremonies do so with a certain schadenfreude. They’re less interested in seeing glitz and glamour or deserving artists being justly rewarded than seeing events going wrong or wildly off-piste. It’s an argument that has been reinforced over the past week, with discussion of Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars showing no sign of abating as opinion pieces and blog posts on the subject are churned out. This week’s big awards ceremony thus finds itself struggling to make itself noticed in the aftermath of last week’s big awards ceremony. The Grammys has valiantly plodded on, making announcements about what it has in store, without dislodging Smith and Rock from the headlines: what price the hot news that Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak’s retro-soul outfit Silk Sonic are opening the show, that the Foo Fighters’ appearance has been replaced by a hastily convened tribute to their late drummer Taylor Hawkins, or indeed the saga of Korean boyband BTS – two of whom have Covid, and may or may not perform – compared with one Hollywood star lamping another on live TV? Anyone tuning in for that sense of schadenfreude can always cling to the prospect of Kanye West attending – barred from performing as a result of his latest social media meltdown, he has nevertheless received five nominations for his album Donda – and the fact that the event is hosted by Trevor Noah, the subject of a recent Instagram tirade by West that included racial slurs. Under the circumstances, it’s probably best to try to drown out the chatter and concentrate on the music. The winner before the winners are announced seems to be Jon Batiste, who has 11 nominations thanks to his score for the Pixar animation Soul and his album We Are. That said, it’s worth noting that competition in the album of the year category is strong and not just because it includes Taylor Swift touting the follow-up to last year’s album of the year winner and the hugely successful debut by Olivia Rodrigo – herself the recipient of seven nominations, which feels very much like her coronation as the new queen of teen and tweenage pop. The previous incumbent, Billie Eilish, also has seven nominations, although her album Happier Than Ever was relatively coolly received, which given how much of that album was devoted to exploring the ghastliness of fame, possibly came as a relief. Also among the album nominees lurks Love for Sale, the second collaborative effort from Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett: the latter is 95 and living with Alzheimer’s, and you can never underestimate the willingness of the Grammys to wax sentimental and treat an award as a kind of long-service medal. Nevertheless, Batiste should win something. He’s an endlessly fascinating artist – his background is in jazz, although he declines to label his own music as such; his desire to connect with a broader audience has led him to do everything from record entire albums on subway trains to leading the house band on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. And We Are is an exceptional piece of work: urgently political, packed with fantastic songs and genre-defying, as evidenced by the fact that his name turns up in categories devoted to jazz, R&B, traditional R&B and American roots music. HER should also be rewarded – another artist with multiple nominations and a great album in the shape of Back of My Mind. She won last year’s song of the year Grammy for I Can’t Breathe, a feat it’s not inconceivable she might repeat with Fight for You, a song that’s already won an Oscar. Elsewhere, it’s tough luck for Justin Bieber: his game demand that the Grammys consider him an R&B rather than a pop artist appears to have fallen on deaf ears. However, he has managed to rustle up eight nominations with the meagre album Justice, which should bring some consolation. Meanwhile, patriotic onlookers in search of evidence that British pop is flourishing across the Atlantic have a rather thin time of it. Ed Sheeran gets a nomination for the omnipresent single Bad Habits and nothing for its accompanying album =, which was subject to a noticeably more muted commercial reception in the US than elsewhere. Arlo Parks is an outrider in the best new artist category, while Glass Animals perhaps have a better chance: they’re bigger in the US than at home, thanks to the old-fashioned expedient of relentlessly touring. That said, the chances of them triumphing over the ubiquitous Olivia Rodrigo look slim – indeed, there’s a decent chance she could sweep the board.",Arts/Music,Can the 2022 Grammys yield as much drama as last week’s Oscars?,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/01/can-the-2022-grammys-yield-as-much-drama-as-last-weeks-oscars
4/1/2022,"The US Senate is coming close to reaching agreement on a pared-down $10bn emergency aid package for Covid response, amid anger that the deal looks likely to ditch most funding for critical global vaccine efforts. Senate leaders were indicating to reporters on Friday that a deal was within reach, with a possible vote over the next week. But the package is a pale reflection of the original White House request for $22bn, cutting deep into even the most recent proposal set at $15.6bn. A large slice of the savings will probably be made at the expense of efforts to support vaccination drives around the world. The Biden administration had asked for $5bn, but as final talks continued it appeared that the amount for global aid could be slashed to as little as $1bn. Leading Democrats have expressed dismay at the reduction in planned global vaccine efforts. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, called the latest proposal “shameful”, pointing out that low vaccination rates in parts of the world run the risk of new Covid variants arising. “We have said, we have pronounced, everyone knows: none of us is safe, unless all of us are safe,” Pelosi said. Chris Coons, Democratic senator from Delaware, also decried the global cuts as shortsighted. “There are 2.5 billion people unvaccinated in the world, and that is an ongoing daily risk to the United states,” he told the Washington Post. Some top Republicans also expressed unease. Mitch McConnell, the minority leader in the Senate, told Punchbowl News that it would be “terribly unfortunate” if international vaccine support were removed from the final deal. Much of the funding currently earmarked in the proposals would go towards domestic treatments for people with Covid-19 in order to help outcomes and to reduce stress on hospitals. Another slice of the money would go towards research on new vaccines and treatments. One concern about the reduction in funds is that the US could become less prepared in the event of a renewed surge of infection. Average cases have plateaued in recent days, though there is still concern about BA 2, the new contagious Omicron subvariant that is now dominant in the US and that has seen a spike in Europe and the UK. The United Nations has repeatedly warned about low vaccination rates in parts of the world. Earlier this month the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, lamented the “grim reality” that only 13% of people in low-income countries were vaccinated compared with almost 79% in high-income countries. “The result is more than 60,000 deaths per week, along with an increased risk of the emergence of new variants,” she said.",News/World news,Senate deal on drastically pared-down Covid aid package may be imminent,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/covid-aid-package-senate-agreement-imminent
4/1/2022,"There are currently three distinct tiers within women’s rugby at the elite level. The largest cluster consists of teams composed of amateurs and semi-professionals battling for survival and recognition. There is a much smaller pool that includes New Zealand, France and, most recently, Wales, who have a smattering of full-time rugby players in their ranks with many relying on short-term retainers. Away in the distance, all on their own, is England. Their coach, Simon Middleton, can select from 29 players who have no other professional obligation other than winning rugby matches. They have won their last 19 in a row, an unprecedented streak that is in little danger of ending this Sunday against Italy in Parma. Underlining the riches at his disposal, Middleton has made 11 changes to the XV that swept Scotland 57-5 in Edinburgh last weekend without sacrificing on the quality of his team. Natasha Hunt starts at scrum-half, earning her 56th cap after a 16-month absence. “She’s been walking around with a big smile on her face,” Middleton says. “She’s buzzing. We’re just really thrilled to see her play again.” The full-back Ellie Kildunne is the only member of the backline who keeps her place from the Scotland game. Helena Rowland shifts to inside-centre having been nudged out by Zoe Harrison who comes in at 10. Emily Scarratt drops to the bench and is replaced by Holly Aitchison at outside-centre. Poppy Cleall will captain from her preferred position at No 8, with Sarah Hunter named among the replacements. The Harlequins duo Shaunagh Brown and Vickii Cornborough prop up the front row with the teenager Sadia Kabeya starting for the first time this year at openside flanker. Eight of England’s match-day 23 have yet to lose in an England shirt. With victory all but guaranteed this weekend, how does Middleton maintain standards and reduce the risk of complacency? “Simply because of the competition for places and the intensity we train with and the expectation of performance,” he says. “They have a really good understanding of why they haven’t lost yet.” Middleton has told his team to “expect the unexpected” against Italy who employ an erratic kicking game from broken play. “They’ve got good skills across their backline, they’ve got some real unpredictability about them,” he says. “We’ve got to really impose ourselves.” Stadio Sergio Lanfranchi, Parma, 3pm BST Sunday 3 April Italy: V Ostuni Minuzzi; A Muzzo, M Sillari, B Rigoni, M Magatti; V Madia, S Stefan; G Maris, M Bettoni, L Gai, S Tounesi, G Duca, F Sberna, I Locatelli, E Giordano (captain). Replacements: V Vecchini, F Barro, S Seye, V Fedrighi, B Veronese, S Barattin, A D’Inca, M Furlan. England: E Kuldunne; L Thompson, H Aitchison, H Rowland, S McKenna; Z Harrison, N Hunt; V Cornborough, L Davies, S Brown, R Galligan, A Ward, A Matthews, S Kabeya, P Cleall (cap) Replacements: C Powell, M Muir, S Bern, S Hunter, V Fleetwood, L Packer, E Scarratt, E Sing. The first 20 minutes may be tight, as it was last year before Scarratt’s 23rd-minute try ignited a 67-3 rout. “That is what you get with a full-time programme,” Middleton says, referencing Italy’s 39-6 loss to France, which saw them concede three tries in the final quarter of the game, as well as England’s win over Scotland. Last week, Scotland carried the ball on 122 occasions to England’s 108. They had more possession, spent more than five minutes in England’s 22 (compared to England’s 44 seconds in Scotland’s red zone) and bossed the territory battle with 62%. And yet they struggled to break the line. Credit must go to England’s defence but Scotland will want to prove that they can translate that attacking intent into points against Wales on Saturday. Outside of the final day showdown between England and France, this could be the contest of the tournament as two aspirational teams meet in Cardiff. Wales came from behind to beat Ireland 27-19 and have named an unchanged 23 for Saturday. Ireland are also unchanged for their trip to Toulouse as they look to build continuity in a squad short of experience. Eimear Considine is the most-capped player with 24 appearances for her country with eight of the starting 15 yet to play in their 10th Test. Such is the reality in the unequal world of women’s rugby.",Sport/Sport,England warned to ‘expect the unexpected’ from Italy in Six Nations,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/01/relentless-england-warned-to-expect-the-unexpected-against-italy
4/1/2022,"I’m in an abandoned-looking house, where a woman appears like a dancing apparition. Then I’m going down a rabbit hole into a tea party in a bright yellow field. I’m conducting avatars moving to Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring; taking part in a dance class where the teacher is a hologram; arriving at a grand Parisian party dressed in Chanel. These are my recent forays into the world of extended reality (XR) in dance. It is technology that we are told is leading us towards a new metaverse, but in practice can often seem more like watching bad graphics in very uncomfortable headgear and wondering what the point is. Nevertheless, a number of choreographers are exploring what XR could bring to dance, whether in virtual reality (VR), where you are completely immersed in a different world via a large headset; or augmented reality (AR), where you wear glasses that add images into the space around you. In an art form that depends on theatres not everyone has access to, XR could be used to attend a virtual performance, or beam specially made dances into your own house. Dance East has even been using AR glasses and 3D volumetric video in schools to provide a virtual teacher to lead dance sessions. Choreographer Jasmin Vardimon took a dive into VR during the pandemic. Her Alice in VR Wonderland is touring UK shopping centres in the back of a converted truck. I tried it out in a car park in Ashford, ushered in by uniformed attendants, sat in a chair that spins 360 degrees so you can follow the journey, and I was happily magicked into Alice’s world. “I always felt dance on video was not doing it justice,” says Vardimon. “But in VR it’s transformed because the dancers are your size, not tiny people on a screen. It makes you feel like you’re in the space with them. When you sit in a theatre the performers are far away from you, but here they come really close and engage with you on a personal level.” Vardimon’s piece is certainly a step beyond watching dance recorded for the small screen. But a new production by the Spanish choreographer Blanca Li goes way beyond anything I’ve experienced in VR dance. Once you get past the complicated tech setup, wearing a backpack, headset, wrist and ankle sensors, it’s like stepping into a Disney movie, absorbed into fantastical settings full of surprising reveals: an enormous ballroom with hundreds of choreographed guests, an endless starry night, an extravagant garden party, a Parisian nightclub filled with can-can girls. It is multisensory: on a boat trip you feel the wind brush past you; you smell roses in bloom. As well as the scale and imagination, what makes Li’s piece different is that while VR experiences are usually for one or two people, here you are part of a group who can all see and interact with each other’s avatars and the performers – you can talk, laugh and dance together. When Li had the idea for Le Bal de Paris, the technology to do it didn’t exist. “I had this dream: how could we be in a virtual reality space but with real people, and share the experience?” she says. Often you don’t see your own body in a VR world. “You are just like a spirit; you put the glasses on, you are in a beautiful place but you don’t exist.” Li approached the French VR studio Backlight, and together they gradually worked out how to put the viewer’s body into the space alongside more and more other people. Li has paid as much attention to detail in Le Bal de Paris as she would any stage show. She asked Chanel to design the costumes – “I couldn’t have the dresses made by a group of boys who design video games” – and they created a virtual collection for her, which, delightfully, participants also get to “wear”. She worked on making sure the dresses moved like real fabric (when I kicked my leg, the white satin of my gown slipped away like an actual dress) and that bodies move almost as gracefully as dancers do. The show is a musical, although the plot is neither here nor there compared with the visual wonder. I was certainly more lost in the 35-minute experience than any other I’d tried, and less aware of the gear and how silly I must have looked from the outside. Li expects many more shows like hers to be made in the coming years, but loves the fact that the audience coming to see it now don’t really know what to expect. “I like the idea of doing things that could not ever have been done before,” she says. “To say: two or three years ago this was impossible. But today we can do it.” Le Bal de Paris is at the Barbican, London, 1-9 April and 19-28 May.

4/1/2022,"Desperate residents in north Cornwall have described themselves as an “endangered species” and are calling for compulsory purchases of unoccupied second homes amid a deepening crisis in affordable housing. The coastal village of St Agnes – located on what one estate agent has labelled the “platinum edge” of the UK – has witnessed a mass protest and hostile graffiti in recent weeks, as outrage has turned into activism. Cath Navin, co-founder of protest group First Not Second Homes, said: “Last month, there were 111 Airbnbs in and around St Agnes, 96 of which were whole houses. If you looked for long-term rentals, the closest place was Portreath (seven miles away). There’s nothing locally for people to live in.” The group has organised peaceful rallies around the county in recent months – the next is at nearby Porthtowan this Sunday. They are campaigning for the introduction of licences for second homes, new planning laws, and an end to “no-fault” evictions, which allow landlords to rapidly expel tenants without good reason. “Ideally, I’d also like to see some retrospective action with compulsory purchases in places where communities are being eroded,” she said. “That’s quite radical, but those things have been introduced internationally so why not here?” Co-founder Camilla Dixon adds: “Ultimately I want to see no second homes until everybody has a decent first home.” Cornwall has 12,776 second homes and more than 11,000 holiday lets, while 21,817 people were on its housing register this week. Last year, the council installed emergency one-bed shelters for vulnerable people in Truro and Penzance. It has also placed people into bed and breakfast accommodation and static caravans. Truro resident Samantha Quinn and her teenage daughter have been forced out of several rental homes in recent years because the properties have been sold. They have waited unsuccessfully on the housing register, lived in temporary holiday accommodation and moved into a friend’s house when there was no alternative. “To say to your child, ‘I actually don’t have a home for you’, felt really rubbish – I felt like I had failed at life,” she said. “As a professional who works full-time in the charity sector and doesn’t have any credit history issues, it’s really weird to think that I was in that position. “The council’s advice last time was, ‘you don’t have to leave your home until you’re evicted by a court’, but I worried that would affect our future prospects. I feel so relieved and lucky to have found a home again.” Lifelong St Agnes resident Nicola Bunt lives in a one-bed wooden cabin in her landlady’s garden. Bunt runs a local cleaning business but refuses to clean holiday lets, even as she tries to save a deposit for a mortgage. “My friends are here, my job is here and this will always be my home, so I really want to stay in St Agnes, but there’s no opportunity for me to buy here, it feels really out of reach,” she said. “Everyone wants a piece of Cornwall and they’re actually ruining what Cornwall is all about.” So outraged was one local pensioner by the construction of another mansion in St Agnes that she defaced an unoccupied seafront property with the words “No more investment properties” and “Second homes owners give something back: rent or sell your empty houses to local people at a fair price”. Speaking anonymously, she said: “When my husband and I bought our place here in 1998 it cost £80,000. We had really ordinary jobs and we could afford to buy here. “Now, half of the properties nearby are holiday lets or second homes and young local people are competing for housing with millionaires. It makes me furious. We’re like an endangered species. This is not the platinum edge of the UK, this is people’s homes and communities.” Cllr Andrew George, formerly MP for St Ives, believes tax loopholes for property investors must be closed immediately. “For years, the public purse has been used to subsidise second homes,” he said. “Thousands of second home owners avoid paying council tax (by qualifying as business premises) and then claim small business rates relief. That loophole cost Cornwall £17m per year before Covid.” The national government also paid almost £170m in Covid grants to Cornish “holiday let business premises” during the pandemic, more than half of which went to owners who live outside the county. “Rather than rewarding second home owners with public money, they should be making them pay a great deal more,” George said. “It’s not the politics of envy, it’s the politics of social justice.”",News/Society,‘Everyone wants a piece of Cornwall’: locals up in arms over second homes,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/01/everyone-wants-a-piece-of-cornwall-locals-up-in-arms-over-second-homes
4/1/2022,"Bridgerton, the steamy soap-opera take on Regency England full of decadent costumes, dashing dukes and elegant backdrops, has once again shot to the top of the Netflix charts. And one industry is reaping the benefits – England’s stately homes. The regal properties are reporting a “Bridgerton factor” aspeople enchanted by the baroque interiors and bucolic gardens of the hit show decide to visit its real life landmarks. Google searches for stately homes in the UK have already increased by 23% in the last month, with more than 8,000 searches, according to the luxury bedroom specialists The French Bedroom Company, which analysed hashtags and Tripadvisor data. Among the buildings featured in the show are Ranger’s House, in London, which was used as the exterior of the Bridgerton family home and Castle Howard, used for outside the Duke of Hastings’s home. Castle Howard said the number of visitors aged 18-24 to their website increased by 3,408% after the programme was released. “We know that screen tourism is a big factor when potential visitors are making decisions about where to plan days out,” said Abbi Olive, Castle Howard’s head of marketing sales and programming. “We were the original screen tourism destination in many ways, having played such a starring role in the original Brideshead Revisited and then in the subsequent film.” She added: “As attractions open up and travel and tourism recover post-pandemic we do expect to see an uplift in visitor numbers due to the Bridgerton factor.” Similarly, English Heritage said visits to the Ranger’s House webpage had increased by 81% compared with the previous month. Chris Small, English Heritage’s London operations manager, said: “Since the launch of Bridgerton in 2020 we have seen many people who were previously unaware of the site inspired to visit. We have even seen some fans of the show pose outside the gilded gates to the house, in full Georgian costume.” The show, he added, had provided an opportunity to introduce a new audience to the The Wernher collection in the interior of the house, one of the greatest surviving private art collections assembled in Europe – which includes Madonna of the Pomegranate (Madonna della Melagrana) from Sandro Botticelli’s workshop. The interest is reflected in the increasing number of Bridgerton-themed tours popping up. Tours International, which offers bespoke group getaways to the UK and Europe, takes fans tofilming locations such as the city of Bath. There are three main benefits to being featured on a smash hit such as Bridgerton, according to Harvey Edgington, the National Trust’s head of filming and locations and co-author of National Trust on Screen – fees, extra visitors and economic generation from crew using local hotels, restaurants and tradespeople. “Any revenue goes straight back into the property that hosted the filming. Quite often that means a conservation issue that’s perhaps on the backburner waiting for funding can come forward,” Edgington said. The show shines a spotlight on many of the National Trust’s properties such as Stowe, Buckinghamshire, which was used to depict Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, with its Temple of Venus providing the glittering backdrop to the outdoor Vauxhall Ball. Season two also features Petworth, West Sussex, Ashridge, Hertfordshire, and Basildon Park, Berkshire, where an evening party scene takes place. For this, the production design team brought in about 5,000 artificial flowers to fill the rose garden with summer blooms and added more greenery and foliage. “We’ve had lots of interest from the public because of Bridgerton,” Edgington said. “Generally with filming we know that the show attracts extra visitors.” He pointed to a report by Olsberg SPI to measure the impact of “set-jetting”. “It found that the 1995 drama Pride and Prejudice is still worth £900,000 a year in visitors to Lyme Park in Cheshire [where Mr Darcy – played by Colin Firth – takes that dip].” But the most popular surge was following Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, when the number of visitors to Antony House in Cornwall quadrupled. There was also a Harry Potter effect at Lacock and other places. “There’s always a fascination with going to see somewhere for real, because the film-makers make the locations look glorious. And I think people get a joy out of thinking, ‘I’m walking where film stars walk’,” Edgington said. To determine the most popular stately homes in the UK, the French Bedroom Company analysed hashtag and Tripadvisor data. Here are the top 10.1. Kensington Palace, London2.
