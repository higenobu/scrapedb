3/3/2022,"Clive Palmer’s team has denied that the billionaire bought a car owned by Adolf Hitler, calling it “fake news”. News Corp reported last week that Palmer, an avid collector of rare cars, had bought the Nazi leader’s bulletproof 1939 770 Grosser Offener Tourenwagen Mercedes-Benz from an unnamed Russian billionaire. The report claimed that Palmer planned to include the Mercedes, which has been traded privately since being seized in France at the end of the war, in a new car museum he planned for the Gold Coast. Reports of the alleged purchase prompted an intervention from home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, who demanded an explanation and said Palmer would have to comply with Australia’s strict import and customs regulations. “I understand why people may find this [alleged] purchase by Clive Palmer offensive,” Andrews said. “It’s up to Clive Palmer to explain his own actions.” Reports of the purchase prompted concerns from two key Jewish community groups, who said they were “deeply troubled” by the news. When contacted by Guardian Australia on Thursday, a spokesperson for Palmer dismissed reporting of the purchase as “fake news”. “Clive Palmer hasn’t bought Adolf Hitler’s car,” the spokesperson said. Further clarification was sought from Palmer’s spokesperson. None was forthcoming by the time of publication. Earlier on Thursday, the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies chief executive, Darren Bark, had said that, if the reports were true, purchasing the car would trivialise “the pain and suffering endured by millions of innocent lives including our Australian servicemen and women, who fought to defeat the Nazis.” “Artefacts from the Nazi era belong in a Holocaust museum, to educate the next generation about how words of hate can lead to violence against minority groups.” Jewish Community Council of Victoria president, Daniel Aghion, also described the potential acquisition of the car as “gruesome”.

Attempting to import asbestos can lead to fines for individuals of up to $180,000 or three times the value of the goods, whichever is the greater. The penalties for companies are greater. There is no suggestion that Palmer is sympathetic to nazism or has ever supported Hitler, his regime, or neo-nazism. Palmer is well known to be an avid collector of cars. Palmer was reported to have acquired the Mercedes along with a Rolls-Royce owned by King Edward VIII. In 2018, local media in the United States reported that the car had failed to sell at auction for USD$7m. The report said that, had the car sold, 10% of the sale price would have gone to Jewish human rights organisation, the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Worldwide Auctioneers, who were conducting the auction, said at the time that negotiations with the bidder would continue privately.

3/3/2022,"London faced a third day of severe disruption as London Underground workers went on strike for the second time this week. Transport for London (TfL) said people should expect all tube services across the capital to be suspended on Thursday, and advised passengers to work from home or walk or cycle where possible, or plan for crowding and delay if using other trains or buses for essential journeys. The 24-hour strike, which started at midnight, follows a similar walkout on Tuesday by members of the RMT union in a dispute over jobs and pensions. TfL said it would seek to run limited tube services where possible, mainly on outer stretches of lines above ground, but most people should not expect to be able to use the underground at all. It hoped to avoid any closures on the overground, but rail services are expected to be busy, and many bus routes are likely to be heavily affected by overcrowding and road congestion. TfL managed to run a few tube trains during the first strike on Tuesday, but commuters in the capital faced severe congestion on the roads, and difficulty on alternative modes of transport. Some London overground services with tube interchanges were also affected. Many bus services were overcrowded in rush hour, leaving people unable to board and stranded. Large queues for buses and taxis were reported outside mainline rail stations in central London as demand outstripped supply. The after-effects of the walkout continued into Wednesday, with tube services starting later in the morning than normal, and sporadic disruption continuing on some routes. Friday morning rush hour is expected to be as disrupted as on Wednesday, with tube services starting only from 8am, TfL said. The dispute comes as London grapples with the financial crisis caused by plunging fares revenues during the pandemic. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, has agreed to conduct a review of TfL’s pension scheme as a condition of the emergency funding given by central government, and to cut underground staffing levels by about 10% by not replacing station workers when they leave or retire. The RMT has accused the government of “cynically engineering a crisis”, and said Khan needed to stand up for transport workers. The general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “If Sadiq Khan spent as much time putting pressure on ministers for a long-term TfL funding deal, instead of accepting their cuts agenda and attacking our members, there would be no need for a strike. “However, as it stands, tube staff face a raid on their pensions and at least 600 job cuts if the government get their way.” Andy Lord, TfL’s chief operating officer, apologised to customers and said he “understood they will be frustrated by this strike action”. He added: “We haven’t proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has lost or will lose their jobs because of the proposals we have set out, so this action is completely unnecessary.” TfL said it remained available for talks but was not expecting the strike to be averted. The RMT said the strike would go ahead again as planned.",News/UK news,Tube strike expected to stop all services as London braces for third day of chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/tube-strike-expected-to-stop-all-services-as-london-braces-for-third-day-of-chaos
