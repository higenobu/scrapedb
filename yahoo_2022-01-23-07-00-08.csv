The woman from Seaford, who asked to be identified as Jean, told CBS2 that she received a call from someone claiming to be her grandson. The man said he was arrested for drunk driving and needed to be bailed out of jail. ""I knew he was a real scammer. I just knew he wasn't going to scam me,"" Jean, 73, told CBS2. ""He starts calling me 'grandma,' and then I'm like, I don't have a grandson that drives, so I knew it was a scam."" The scam took several phone calls to play out and involved multiple unidentified males, police said in a press release. One person claiming to be a lawyer for Jean's grandson told her that he needed $8,000 to get out of jail. A third person called claiming to be a bail bondsman coming to collect the money.
