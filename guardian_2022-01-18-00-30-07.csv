1/18/2022,"Rwanda – one of two African countries to which the UK government is reportedly considering sending asylum seekers for resettlement and processing – was previously embroiled in a highly controversial migrant deportation scheme involving Israel. Although few details have emerged after a report in the Times that migrants could be sent to Ghana and Rwanda, Rwanda’s previous involvement in receiving African deportees from Israel raises serious concerns over whether – even with UK funding – it has the resources or even willingness to host deportations.  The suggestion that people could be sent to the two African countries was included in proposals reportedly under consideration by British ministers, which also include using the armed forces to push back small boats crossing the Channel. The inclusion of Rwanda as a potential destination, however, is bound to raise eyebrows. Of about 4,000 people estimated to have been deported by Israel to Rwanda and Uganda under a “voluntary departure” scheme between 2014 and 2017, almost all are thought to have left the country almost immediately, with many attempting to return to Europe via people-smuggling routes. In addition, at least one deportee still in Rwanda, tracked down by Israel’s Haaretz newspaper in 2018, described being destitute and living on the streets of Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. Clouded in secrecy, and with Rwanda officially denying its involvement, details of the arrangement and the fate of some of those deported have been described in several reports, some of which included testimony from those who said they had been sent to Rwanda. Critics at the time, including the rights group Amnesty International, also pointed out that Israel had a far smaller number of refugees than Rwanda, and was a much wealthier country. Amnesty said Israel was “foisting its responsibility on countries who have only a fraction of the wealth and resources”, an argument that would also apply to the UK. Details of the arrangement between Israel and Rwanda were thrust into the spotlight in 2018 at a time when Israel’s supreme court was considering whether to approve a compulsory programme that would offer African migrants the option of a financially incentivised deportation to one of two “unnamed African countries” or face indefinite detention. That scheme, however, followed a “voluntary departure programme” that had been running for several years and had been beset by serious problems. At the time, the two unnamed African countries involved were widely reported to be Rwanda and Uganda, with the UN’s main refugee agency, UNHCR, expressing its concern about the lack of transparency around the secretive arrangements. The UNHCR’s assistant high commissioner for protection, Volker Türk wrote in 2017: “From the start of this programme, some 4,000 Eritrean and Sudanese were relocated under the government’s ‘voluntary departure programme’ to two African countries, named in media reports as Rwanda and Uganda. “Due to the secrecy surrounding this policy and the lack of transparency concerning its implementation, it has been very difficult for UNHCR to follow up and systematically monitor the situation of people relocated to these African countries. “UNHCR, however, is concerned that these persons have not found adequate safety or a durable solution to their plight and that many have subsequently attempted dangerous onward movements within Africa or to Europe.” A report by the International Refugee Rights Initiative two years earlier interviewed a number of individuals who said they had been deported from Israel to Rwanda. Testimonies collected by IRRI suggested “that the majority, if not all, are being smuggled out of the country by land to Kampala [in Uganda] within days of arriving in [the Rwandan capital] Kigali. “They are not given an opportunity to apply for asylum, and even if they wish to stay in Rwanda, their refugee claims cannot be assessed as the national refugee status determination committee has not yet been established. “These transfers appear to be coordinated by the people who receive the asylum seekers at Kigali airport. From Kampala, the majority travel north to South Sudan, Sudan and Libya, with many ultimately risking crossing the Mediterranean or falling into the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (IS) in the hope of finding safety in Europe.” Some of those interviewed by IRRI described being given only a holiday visa on arrival in Rwanda and being sent to a hotel from where they were encouraged to travel to Uganda illegally. Among the very few deported from Israel voluntarily who did opt to stay was a 28-year-old Eritrean man named Goitom, who spoke to Haaretz newspaper in Kigali in 2018. He had not been allowed to work and was living on the streets. “Things are so bad. I am living very badly. I have no home, there is no work,” he told the paper. “Before, there were a few people who helped me. The United Nations also helped – they gave me money for lodging and food. But they stopped.”",News/World news,Rwanda’s history of receiving deportees raises concerns for potential UK scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/rwanda-uk-asylum-seekers-deportees-israel-scheme
1/18/2022,"China’s coal production reached record levels last year as the state encouraged miners to ramp up their fossil fuel output to safeguard the country’s energy supplies through the winter gas crisis. The world’s biggest coal producer and consumer mined 384.67m tonnes of the fossil fuel last month, easily topping its previous record of 370.84m tonnes set in November, after the government called for miners to work at maximum capacity to help fuel the country’s economic growth.  Official government figures show that China’s coal binge also spurred the country to record high coal output over the year as a whole. Chinese coal production climbed to an all-time high of 4.07bn tonnes, up 4.7% on the previous year, in a blow to climate campaigners months after the UN’s Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that global consumption of coal power, which is the world’s single biggest source of climate emissions, would reach record levels in 2021 driven by a surge in demand for energy to kickstart global economies following the coronavirus pandemic. Coal power fell by 4% in 2020 as the pandemic caused a global economic slowdown, but the IEA found that the surge in demand for electricity during 2021 outpaced the growth in low-carbon sources, leading many wealthy economies to rely more heavily on fossil fuel power plants. The IEA’s most recent report, published last week, found the steepest ever increase in global electricity demand last year was stoked by a 9% increase in coal use compared with the year before, or more than half of the global increase in power demand, to reach an all-time peak. China’s record coal consumption comes weeks after the conclusion of the Cop26 climate talks, which ended in a fierce disagreement over a pledge to abandon coal. A last-minute intervention by India successfully watered down the language of the pact from “phasing out” to “phasing down”. After the talks, held in Glasgow last month, the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, said India and China would “have to explain themselves to poor nations” after watering down the Glasgow climate pact, adding that their actions had left him “deeply frustrated”. The IEA found that coal plants in the US and the EU produced 20% more electricity last year, from low levels in 2020, but their use remained below the levels recorded in 2019. The reliance on coal plants is expected to decline again next year as electricity demand slows and the expansion of renewable energy alternatives continues.",News/Environment,China’s coal production hit record levels in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/chinas-coal-production-hit-record-levels-in-2021
1/18/2022,"Novak Djokovic may not be allowed to defend his French Open title in May after the French government ruled that all athletes will have to be vaccinated in order to attend and compete in sporting events in France. The French sports minister, Roxana Maracineanu, has announced that athletes would not be exempt from France’s Covid pass, which will soon come into effect for over 16s. “The vaccination pass has been adopted. As soon as the law is promulgated, it will become mandatory to enter public buildings already subject to the health pass (stadium, theatre or lounge) for all spectators, practitioners, French or foreign professionals,” she wrote on twitter.  Earlier in January, Maracineanu had suggested that athletes could be exempt from France’s vaccination requirements through a “bubble” system, but the government have now scrapped any such plans. Stanislas Guerini, the French MP and executive director for En Marche, said Djokovic’s behaviour was “irresponsible” as he discussed the Covid pass in an interview with RTL on Monday morning. “All the big events which will take place in France will also adopt the Covid pass,” he said. “Who would understand if we asked our citizens to make an effort and respect the rules if we authorise some to get out of them?” Djokovic arrived back in Belgrade, Serbia on Monday after being deported from Australia following the cancellation of his visa by the Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke. Under Australia’s visa cancellation rules, Djokovic is currently banned from re-applying for a visa for three years. Djokovic was greeted by some supporters and journalists at the airport on his return to Serbia and as the Australian Open began on Monday, Serbian players spoke publicly about his deportation. “I think the way they treated him was terribly wrong,” said Serbian No 3, Dusan Lajovic. “I think the decision itself was terribly wrong, and also the reason why they did it is also for me terribly wrong because based [on] just an idea, I don’t think it’s the right way.” Laslo Djere described Djokovic’s visa cancellation as a “catastrophic situation,” and said the world will have a different opinion on Australia after Djokovic’s incident and believes he will come back stronger than ever. “That’s also in our Serbian mentality. When we get beat down or we are treated a bad way or how we maybe don’t deserve, we just try to – especially him – tries to be inspired by that and gain strength from that.”",Sport/Sport,Djokovic’s French Open title defence in doubt over Covid pass ruling,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/djokovics-french-open-title-defence-in-doubt-over-covid-pass-ruling
1/18/2022,"I’d wanted to be a children’s TV presenter ever since I was 12. I had a place at Bournemouth University, but instead got a job as a runner at Children’s BBC, and ended up on screen when they were looking for someone to join The Broom Cupboard. Dom was a magician from Exeter. He was on another CBBC show called The Friday Zone and would come into The Broom Cupboard. The boss saw that there was chemistry and we were employed to do links as Richard and Dominic. As we become mates offscreen, we became Dick and Dom.  CBBC had just launched on digital, so they said: “Do you fancy doing some long links around the cartoons on a Saturday?” We said: “Yeah, sure.” Then they decided it should be an actual programme. Ali G Indahouse was big at the time, so they went: “How about Dick and Dom In Da House?” Then another boss – I think they were quite drunk at a dinner party – said: “In Da House isn’t original enough,” and somebody shouted: “How about Dick and Dom In Da Bungalow?” So the title came first. The format stuck from the off – a gameshow with six studio contestants called Bungalow Heads. We were up against SM:TV Live (with H and Claire from Steps) on ITV and The Saturday Show (with Fearne Cotton and Simon Grant) on BBC One, so at first we hardly got any viewers. But by late 2002, we were pulling in half a million a week, which was unheard of on a digital channel. The BBC said: “This should be on BBC One.” And soon we were. It was popular with kids, parents and students. The BBC were overjoyed. They realised they had a huge hit on their hands so they left us to it. We were just trying to do original content that kids would find funny. We didn’t set out to get complaints. We were the second children’s programme ever to be mentioned in the House of Commons. Blue Peter was mentioned for something boring. Then an MP called Peter Luff said of In Da Bungalow: “Why should the licence-fee payer be paying for such lavatorial content?” I don’t think you’d be able to make anything like it now. That’s why Saturday morning is now all just cooking. I struggled with dyslexia and knew that academia wasn’t going to be my path, so I got into drama and joined the National Youth Music Theatre. I saw Chris Evans on The Big Breakfast and thought: “I want to do that.” I thought magic could be my tool to get into TV so I kept sending in my VHS showreel to CBBC. Then, one holiday morning, I switched on the telly and there was this fresh-faced new presenter from Sheffield called Richard. I thought: “You absolute pig. You’ve stolen my job!” You can’t manufacture a double act. We got on straight away and lived together for years. There was no big game plan, we just understood our audience – kids want to see you having fun. We didn’t plan to make it to BBC One and win Baftas. But we were delighted when Charlie Brooker called us “a carnival of cackling clowns” in the Guardian. Then we were on the cover of a Halloween edition, with me dressed as a pumpkin and Rich pouring custard over my head. The producer used to play Bogies when he worked in the theatre, only he used a much ruder word. He thought: “Why don’t we try it on kids’ TV?” We screamed it in Madame Tussauds and it was really funny. Then we went to Nando’s, screamed in there for a bit, and it just evolved into this very naughty animal. This country loves a catchphrase and ours will be attached to us for the rest of our lives. If we snuff it in some horrific accident, you’ll know because Bogies will be trending on Twitter. It’s hard to look back at Bungalow without it triggering traumatic stress disorder. That bit with the cow is deeply weird. Back then, a lot of great entertainment – like TFI Friday and Chris Moyles on BBC Radio 1 – was ad-libbed. Our script was just bullet points. It just said: “Cow gives birth.” So I’m stood next to a giant cow. The cow goes into labour with this weird noise and gives birth to Rich, who’s covered in this disgusting afterbirth that he slips around in like Bambi. He stands up and goes: “It’s me!” Then everyone cheers – and I get sucked back into the cow’s, well, wherever Rich came out of. I mean, you just don’t get that on TV any more.",Arts/Culture,How we made Dick and Dom In Da Bungalow,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/17/how-we-made-dick-and-dom-in-da-bungalow
1/18/2022,"The hostage-taking attack on a Texas synagogue has renewed fears of increasing antisemitism in the US. The incident, which Joe Biden called “an act of terror”, comes as organizations tracking antisemitic violence say it is increasing across the US.  “Assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews remain at near-historic levels in the US,” said the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in its most recent Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. According to the group, there were more than 2,100 acts of assault, vandalism and harassment last year, an increase of 12% over the previous year. Following the hostage crisis at the synagogue in the Fort Worth suburb of Colleyville, the anti-hate group ADL called on the US Congress to increase funding for non-profit Jewish organizations, including schools and houses of worship, for assistance in bolstering their security. “With threats against synagogues and other Jewish institutions arguably at an all-time high, it is imperative that the federal government provides appropriate levels of funding to mitigate the threat,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL’s CEO. The ADL also urged legislators in the Senate to confirm Dr Deborah Lipstadt as the state department’s special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism. The incident in Texasended around 9pm Saturday when the last hostages ran out of the synagogue and an FBI Swat team entered and killed their captor, Briton Malik Faisal Akram. It came despite the congregation receiving security training from local authorities and the Secure Community Network, which was founded in 2004 by a coalition of Jewish organizations. “In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” the congregation’s Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker said in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.” The standoff has led US law enforcement agencies to tighten security at potential Jewish targets across America, including New York City, where police said that they increased their presence “at key Jewish institutions” out of an abundance of caution. Sunday’s incident comes after a 2018 attack on the the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where 11 worshippers were killed, and a deadly antisemitic attack on a congregation in Poway, California, the following year. Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said in a statement that the attack had shown the Jewish communities around the world “are living in dangerous times”. “Just as when the target of a violent antisemitic attack was the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, or the synagogue in Halle, Germany, or the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California, the attack on Congregation Beth Israel is an attack on all of us.”We must continue to tackle this age-old hatred head on,” Lauder added. The FBI issued a statement calling the ordeal “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted”. The agency said the joint terrorism task force is investigating. Akram was specifically focused on demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist suspected of having ties to al-Qaida who was convicted of trying to kill US army officers in Afghanistan and is serving an 86-year sentence in nearby Fort Worth. In a statement, the ADL said Siddiqui’s release has been a focus for non-extremist groups, as well, who allege mistreatment and fabricated charges. The group warned that rightwing and other extremists would attempt to exploit the Colleyville crisis to advance their own ideologies – “a clear indication that acts of antisemitism tend to inspire further expressions of antisemitism”.",News/US news,Texas hostage crisis renews fears of increasing antisemitism in US,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/17/texas-hostage-crisis-antisemitism-fears-us
1/18/2022,"There is “massive anger” among grassroots Conservative party supporters over the Downing Street parties scandal, the head of a leading group has said as its survey found 40% thought Boris Johnson should resign. Ed Costelloe, chairman of Grassroots Conservatives, said it had been years since the group last polled its supporters and followers but it felt compelled by the “unique” nature of the public mood.  “Obviously nobody is happy. There is massive anger, absolutely. And justifiably,” said Costelloe, adding that most people said they had written to their MP or local party branch to express their opinion. “But some people said this is not necessarily the time to change the captain on the bridge. A lot of people have said they think he should go, but not yet.” Tory MPs reported being inundated with emails about the issue, with one describing the numbers as “off the scale”. A staffer said a lot of emails to their MP contained “stories of personal hardship from new people, not the regulars”. These were emails they would usually respond to as soon as possible but it was difficult to do so while awaiting the findings of an inquiry by Sue Gray, they said. In some areas, anger spilled over into vandalism, with the constituency office of Derbyshire MP Robert Largan daubed with the word “lies”, according to pictures on Sunday. Last week the office of Wellingborough MP Peter Bone was graffitied with the word “liar”. Conservative associations across the country said members were growing increasingly frustrated and some were leaving the party in protest. “If he doesn’t go soon we will lose all the local elections that are coming up, or very many of them, and do immense damage to the party,” said Ann Stribley, the chairman of Poole Conservative Association. “We have had a number of members saying they can’t continue to be members while Boris [Johnson] is there. It’s been very difficult. A small minority have resigned.” “The sad thing for me is that good councillors and people who work hard for their constituents on a local level will probably end up paying the price in the [local election] polls in May,” said Philip Sagar, deputy chairman of the Grantham and Stamford Conservatives, who said he thinks Johnson should resign, though not immediately. “I think he endeared himself to people because he is seen as being fallible and making mistakes. People loved him for that, and whether he has squandered all that goodwill, I do worry about that. So yes, I am angry and disappointed.” Merilyn Davies, a cabinet member on West Oxfordshire district council, said: “If the prime minister wants Conservative councillors to have a chance of winning back their seats in May, he needs to step aside and let us get on with the important job of providing vital services to our residents. This will not go away until he resigns.” James Johnson, formerly in charge of polling at No 10, said he questioned focus groups of voters last week in the “red wall” seat of Bolton North East, which went Tory for the first time in 2019 with a majority of just 378. Tory voter responses included the stark: “He’s a coward.” Another talked of quite liking Johnson at the beginning but “now, it’s like, we’ve been made a fool of”. Another said: “It’s the fact that he lied. If he turned round and said: ‘Yep, I’ve done it, I’m sorry,’ that would have been OK. But he lied. What else has he been lying about? I think he’s completely lost everyone’s trust.” Another said: “They’re all up there backing him, most of them. That’s my worry now, with the party. ‘Oh he’s apologised, let’s just get on with the job.’ No – you’ve lied about doing the job. The rest of his party, apologising and saying they are going to back him. How can you?” James Johnson said he asked all the first-time Boris Johnson voters whether they would vote for him again. “Not one person put their hand up.”",News/Politics,‘Massive anger’: 40% of grassroots Tories want Boris Johnson to quit,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/grassroots-tories-want-boris-johnson-to-quit
1/18/2022,"The future of press freedom in Indian-administered Kashmir has been thrown into question after pro-government journalists and police officers forcibly took over its independent press club, which the authorities later shut down. The incident, which follows the harassment and detention of dozens of journalists in Kashmir in recent months, is the latest attack on independent journalism in the region, which is disputed between India and Pakistan.  A small group of journalists supportive of the Indian government stormed the Kashmir Press Club with the assistance of armed police over the weekend, allegedly threatening its ruling body, and locked up the building, preventing journalists from entering. The club, which has irked the government by defending media freedoms and its critical reporting, had been about to hold new elections. The overthrow was widely condemned. The Editors Guild of India said it was “aghast at the manner in which the office and the management of Kashmir Press Club … was forcibly taken over” and accused the state of being “brazenly complicit in this coup”. The former chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir, Omar Abdulllah, also called it a “state-sponsored coup”. The worst fears of the independent journalist community in Kashmir were confirmed on Monday when the regional administration declared the press club had been deregistered as a society and “ceased to exist”, and that the land on which it stands was being taken back into government hands. “It seems the ultimate goal was to shut down the Kashmir Press Club,” its general secretary, Ishfaq Tantray, said. “By this action, they wanted to stifle the voice of journalists that resonated through the forum … the only democratic and independent journalist body” in the region. The government defended its actions as protectiing press freedom and ensuring the “safety of bona fide journalists”. There has been a growing crackdown on independent journalism in Kashmir since the national government led by Narendra Modi unilaterally revoked the region’s autonomy in August 2019, stripped it of statehood, dissolved its government and brought it under Delhi’s control. Journalists reporting critically in the region have faced intimidation, harassment and lengthy and exhausting interrogations and investigations. More than 40 have been subjected to raids or police questioning in the past two years or placed on no-fly lists, preventing them from leaving the country. The government also introduced a draconian new media policy for Kashmir in June 2020, which introduced mandatory background checks for journalists and gave the administration power to prosecute those whom officials decide are spreading misinformation or fake news. The press club is the latest independent civil society group, following the Kashmir High Court Bar Association and the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce, to be forcibly prevented from holding elections since August 2019. “Journalism has been choked in the region, especially in last two years, with continuous summons and detentions of journalists,” said Fahad Shah, the editor of the local newspaper the Kashmir Walla. “Multiple raids have been conducted at journalists’ houses and offices too. It is just unfortunate how brazenly power is being used and laws are being scuttled to force people to toe a line that the government is comfortable with.” Sajad Gul, an independent journalist from Kashmir who has reported on alleged “fake encounters”, in which the military stages the death of civilians as militants, was detained on Monday under the Public Safety Act, a law that allows people to be arrested to prevent them acting against the security of the state. Shah, who has published Gul’s work, said he had been detained for doing his job and that Kashmir Walla lawyers were fighting his case. “Freedom of press in Kashmir has been a casualty under the current government,” he said.",News/World news,Kashmir independent press club shut down in media crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/kashmir-independent-press-club-shut-down-in-media-crackdown
1/18/2022,"Tickets to the Beijing Winter Olympics will not be sold to the general public, but distributed to “targeted” groups, organisers have announced, in China’s latest attempt to control the spread of the highly-infectious Omicron Covid variant. Beijing reported its first locally transmitted Omicron case over the weekend, piling renewed pressure on authorities in the run-up to the Games, which are due to start on 4 February and coincide with the lunar new year celebrations week, typically the biggest travel period of the year.  Organisers of the Winter Olympics previously said the Games would be kept in a “closed loop”, meaning that only a limited number of spectators would be allowed in venues. Overseas spectators will not be allowed to enter the country, and personnel involved in the Games will have to avoid contact with people outside the loop. On Monday, the organisers cited the “severe and complex” Covid-19 situation and the need to protect the safety of Olympics personnel and spectators in an announcement. “In order to protect the health and safety of Olympic-related personnel and spectators, it was decided to adjust the original plan to sell tickets to the public and [instead] organise spectators to watch the Games on site,” they said. Local spectators who receive tickets must observe strict Covid prevention measures before, during and after attending Olympic events, the organising committee said, without giving further details, or specifying how tickets would be distributed. China’s attempts to enforce its “zero-Covid” containment policy are threatened by the Omicron variant. On Monday, authorities urged citizens not to order goods from overseas, after they claimed that a recent Omicron infection detected in Beijing had come from an international package sent from Canada. China has claimed that numerous Covid infections throughout the pandemic have come from imported products – often cold chain items – but experts say the scientific basis for such claims is weak. Last month North America’s national hockey league said its players would not participate in the Beijing Winter Olympics due to Covid disruptions of the league schedule. The latest information on the first Omicron case in Beijing came hours before President Xi Jinping vowed to present a “streamlined, safe and splendid Games to the world” in his keynote speech at the Davos economic forum. Chinese health authorities on Monday reported 223 cases from the previous 24 hours to midnight, including 163 local transmissions. The majority were in Tianjin, where mainland China’s first Omicron case was identified on 9 December. The authorities said 79 of its 80 cases in Tianjin were found in Jinnan district, and 68 in Henan province, of which 60 were in the locked-down city of Anyang. One case reported in the southern city of Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, was confirmed as Omicron.

1/18/2022,"Ben Stokes is set to join Joe Root in making himself unavailable for this year’s Indian Premier League auction following England’s Ashes defeat in Australia. The all-rounder has featured in the last four seasons of the lucrative Twenty20 tournament, playing for the now defunct Rising Pune Supergiant franchise on a £1.7m deal in 2017 – and winning the MVP award – before joining Rajasthan Royals the following year for £1.3m.  Stokes was released by the Royals after missing the bulk of last year’s campaign through injury, but as a fast bowling all-rounder he was expected to attract another bumper contract when the world’s best players go under the hammer on 12 and 13 February. But amid an ever-crunched international schedule made even more gruelling by the pandemic, and having only returned from a four-month break to address a finger injury and his mental health before the recent Ashes campaign, the 30-year-old is understood not to have registered his name for 2022. Root stated a similar intention to turn down the IPL after the 146-run loss in the fifth Test in Hobart and though he went unsold in 2018 – his only previous time in the auction – such that a buyer was not guaranteed, the creation of two new teams with a combined 16 overseas berth had increased the possibility. “There’s a lot that we need to do for this [Test] team, which deserves all of my energy,” said Root. “I’ll keep sacrificing as much as I can because I care so much about Test cricket in our country and trying to get us to where we want to be.” England’s relationship with the IPL – unique in world cricket due to its overlap with the home summer – has thawed in recent times such that Test players who held deals were rested by the national set-up during last year’s packed winter schedule and also missed the belatedly-scheduled home series against New Zealand. A heavy Ashes defeat means centrally-contracted players are set to be limited in terms of their IPL availability this year. The tournament starts on 3 April, less than a week after a three-Test series in the Caribbean ends on 28 March, while its final is slated for 3 June, the day after another home Test series versus New Zealand begins.",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes set to join Joe Root in not taking part in this year’s IPL,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/ben-stokes-set-to-join-joe-root-in-not-taking-part-in-this-years-ipl-england-cricket
