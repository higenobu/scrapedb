12/31/2021,"Indigenous health groups have lambasted national cabinet’s move to narrow the definition of a close contact as the “wrong decision”, amid concern over the possibility of outbreaks in remote communities with comparatively low vaccination rates. With some PCR testing sites overwhelmed and a widespread shortage of rapid antigen tests, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Thursday leaders had agreed to a change that will see fewer people required to get tested and those who are positive released from isolation sooner.  In the Northern Territory, which announced a record 60 cases on Friday, the chief minister, Michael Gunner, said he would introduce an indoor mask mandate in response to the rising infections. There are 24 people in hospital and none in intensive care, figures released on Friday showed. However, Gunner also said the NT would liberalise its definition of a close contact to focus on “household contacts” rather than possible exposures at other sites. “We know New South Wales and the east coast are in a different situation to the territory, but a lot of decisions made by [national cabinet] will work for the territory and can be applied here,” he said. John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance of the NT, told Guardian Australia the new close contact definition adopted by national cabinet was the “wrong decision”. “We’ve got a fast-moving virus that’s spreading itself through the entire community,” he said. “It’s a matter of if not when it gets into our most vulnerable, remote, sickest population in some of those communities throughout the Northern Territory, and throughout Australia I should add.” While vaccination rates across Australia are some of the highest in the world, Indigenous leaders fear there are still pockets where rates are lagging. In some regions of Queensland, the fully vaccinated rate among Aboriginal people over 15 years old was still hovering between 55% and 70% on 21 December, according to Department of Health data. Paterson also pointed to reports that the Palm Island Aboriginal shire council this week uploaded a grim image to social media of a white shipping container that it said had been received from Queensland Health. It said it was to be used as a temporary morgue if required and was the “starkest reminder yet that locals are at serious risk of illness and death from Covid”. “That’s frightening stuff,” Paterson said. “I’ve had people texting and sending messages that it’s (the easing of Covid guidelines) causing huge anxieties in remote communities.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Outside Darwin, the vaccination rate in the Northern Territory among Aboriginal people over 15 years old was also about 70%. Paterson said communities in the Barkly local government area, which includes Tennant Creek, which was recently in lockdown, and remote communities in the Alice Springs LGA were among those he was worried about. “What’s worked for us effectively in the Northern Territory … is we were able to identify where those close contacts were: the venues, the communities, airports, wherever,” Paterson said. “If you were on a plane and sitting two rows from a positive case you were alerted and had to go and get tested. That was a very effective public health strategy of informing the broader community of close contacts.” Gunner said on Friday that since the NT changed its border rules “the vast majority of transmission has been enclosed household contacts”. “It makes sense to direct our resources into household contacts,” he said. Gunner said people who test positive would need a negative PCR test on day six to be released from isolation. No such requirement now exists in NSW. Gunner said unvaccinated close contacts would also be required to isolate for 14 days, rather than seven. He also indicated that the government might consider other measures to flatten the curve, including lockdowns. “At this stage though we think the indoor mask mandate is a proportionate response,” he said. Vaccination levels among Indigenous Australians are well in excess of 80% in almost all regions of NSW and Victoria, which have so far been hardest hit by the virus. But they are much lower in South Australia, where cases are rising significantly, and only between 45% and 60% in most regions of Western Australia, which plans to keep its borders shut until next year. Dr Jason Agostino, a medical adviser to the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, said before the close contact definition was changed there had already been twice the rate of infection for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, a reference to figures compiled in October. “What I’m fearing is that [Indigenous communities] will be hit hardest,” he told ABC Radio on Friday morning. “We have unacceptable levels of crowded housing and people with chronic diseases that start at a younger age, along with in particular in Queensland and South Australia, lower rates of vaccinations. “That mix means more infections as well as more severe disease. As we get out into our rural and remote communities, the capacity to deal with severe disease is really limited.”",News/Australia news,Aboriginal groups fear Covid outbreaks inevitable after changes to close contact definition,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/aboriginal-groups-fear-covid-outbreaks-inevitable-after-changes-to-close-contact-definition
12/31/2021,"Fourteen of author Harlan Coben’s 31 novels, we are told, are due to be adapted for Netflix. Your mileage may vary, of course, but as I have a barely satiable appetite for bingeable thrillers, I see this as more promise than threat. Last year we had The Stranger, an adaptation of Coben’s 2015 bestseller, which leapt from cliffhanger to cliffhanger to tell the increasingly baroque-slash-demented tale of a husband (Richard Armitage) who discovers from a mysterious stranger that his wife faked her pregnancy and miscarriage before she disappeared. Dum-dum-DAH.  Another is now here and Stay Close promises more of almost exactly the same – including Richard Armitage, who is now seedy photographer Ray and, by the end of the opening episode, about to become firmly tied into the main plot. This centres on Megan (Cush Jumbo), whose idyllic life, loving family and perfect kitchen are evidence that she is the keeper of a Secret Past that will soon rear its ugly head and threaten everything she holds dear. And so it proves. Carlton Flynn, a young man in a distinctive necklace, goes missing from about the same place as another man, Stewart Green, did 17 years ago to the day. The latter is the only case Detective Broome (James Nesbitt) has ever failed to solve. He assuaged the pain by sleeping with Stewart’s mum, which may or may not become relevant later (though I feel it’s only fair to point out that in Cobenworld, most things do).. Megan gets home after a night out to find a card on her doorstep addressed to “Cassie”. Her old name! But how?! “Everybody’s findable these days,” the card sender tells her when they meet, which is apparently explanation enough. But who?! It’s Lorraine (Sarah Parish), one of the people left behind when Cassie fled her old life. But why?! Lorraine wants to warn her that Stewart, apparently the reason Cassie wished to flee said old life, is back. But he can’t be, gasps our heroine – “He’s dead!” It’s possible her certainty has something to do with the flashbacks she keeps having to a slashed and bloody presumed-corpse. Before she departs, Lorraine – who, by the way, works at the Vipers club where Carlton was last seen – gives her pal the plastic engagement ring pledged by a man whose heart she broke by leaving. Who could this be? Apropos of nothing, we turn to Ray again. He is mugged for his camera. But he has already uploaded his latest pictures to the cloud. He turns out to have inadvertently captured images of what might be Carlton’s final moments in the local woods (through which, if the flashbacks are anything to go by, Cassie herself fled). While he thinks about what that might mean, he flicks through some old photo albums. They are full of pictures of him with Cassie. But wait! There is still time for one last scene – of Megan’s oldest daughter lying on her bed and toying with a pendant round her neck. You’ll never guess whose it is. Dum-dum-DAH! See you for the next episode, plus the six after that – and there’s no point pretending otherwise.",Arts/Television & radio,Stay Close review – your new Netflix binge-watch?

12/31/2021,"Reclaimed & RewrittenA century after the Tulsa massacre, gal-dem shines a spotlight on the atrocity that destroyed the thriving black community of Greenwood. Host Clarkisha Kent has many a sharp intake of breath as she hears about how the district known as Black Wall Street wasn’t the utopian community it was meant to be. As the six-part podcast unfolds, it doesn’t hold back with uneasy truths – but it is about time they were told. Hannah Verdier  Strippers in the AtticIn series one, this podcast hosted by two strip club workers was a thoughtful, smart exploration of sex work which bubbled over with a vivacious hilarity. In season two, nothing seems to have changed, opening with a funny and very frank interview with Skins actor Megan Prescott, who followed up her TV role by trying her hand at stripping. Alexi Duggins The Famous Sloping PitchIs football getting “a little bit more shit”? Nick Hancock and Chris England think so, hence this banter-packed podcast which offers a comic – and considered – take on the week’s news in the beautiful game. Its interviews with celebrity football fans are also impressively starry. Think Gary Lineker, Adrian Chiles and Jo Brand. AD We Stay LookingInsecure’s spin-off podcast Looking for LaToya spoofed true crime to the max and now its star investigative reporter Rose Cranberry is back with more cases. With her quota of six Black stories per year, Cranberry had better work fast to solve those mysteries, exposing the media and justice system’s inbuilt racism as she goes. HV You’re Not My MumStepmums have long had a bad rep – just ask Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. But while it’s true that navigating stepfamily life isn’t always a fairytale, the joys of it need to be celebrated, too. In this candid new series, Katie Harrison reassuringly talks from a place of experience, while also speaking with experts. Hollie Richardson Chosen by Danielle Stephens Often, when I listen to Griefcast, I’m hearing a celebrity that I know and love talk about someone close to them – who I know nothing about. But when Jimmy Carr recently spoke to Cariad Lloyd in her latest series of the podcast, the pair spent the first part of the show talking about Sean Lock, the comedian who died of cancer in August. Two comedians talking about a fellow comedian is bound to produce some laughs, but it was the compassion – and slight regret in Jimmy’s voice – that made it a lovely tribute. More so than most of Lloyd’s guests, the conversation between her and Carr simply celebrates the ability to talk about grief, making it a must-listen for those who don’t have that opportunity in their day-to-day lives. Fans of those bits in podcasts where they ask you to leave them a review: rejoice!

12/31/2021," It’s time to say “so long” (or “good riddance”) to 2021. Years & Years singer Olly Alexander, who helped a lot of us ease into this year with It’s a Sin, takes the hosting reins for an hour. Kylie Minogue and Pet Shop Boys help out with the music, and there is a pause for the countdown to midnight. Maybe – just maybe – we’re all about to step into a better year. Hollie Richardson Clara Amfo and Jordan North co-host a special TOTP, with the sounds of Sam Fender, Lola Young and Mabel, plus clips from the past 12 months from artists including Billie Eilish and Arlo Parks. Ali Catterall Adam Hills, Alex Brooker and Josh Widdicombe host a two-hour bonanza of their usual end-of-week show to take a look back at the highs and lows of what has been a year to forget, with guests including Joe Wilkinson, Ivo Graham, Nish Kumar and Vick Hope. House band Alex Horne and the Horne Section provide the live tunes. HR A New Year’s Eve special in which Ian Hislop, Paul Merton and assorted guests see off the laugh riot that was 2021 in style. But where to begin? With revolting Trumpists? Vaccine sceptics? Racist football fans? Racist politicians? With the proviso that moaning about 2021 will be like shooting fish in a barrel, this should be entertaining. Phil Harrison Chatshow host Norton never fails to impress with his guestlist on NYE. Claire Foy, Peter Dinklage, Michael Sheen, Cush Jumbo, Joe Lycett and Jessica Chastain (phew!) provide the anecdotes. The Divine Comedy provide some live music, while the Big Red Chair goes global. HR It’s Jools and his annual shindig, which might be the closest many of us get to a party this year. Ed Sheeran performs, while Lulu indulges in a few of her greatest hits. One of 2021’s breakout stars, Joy Crookes, also stops by. Henry Wong The Lost Daughter (Maggie Gyllenhaal, 2021), Netflix Maggie Gyllenhaal’s adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s novel is a stark exploration of motherhood – its pleasures and burdens, plus the general expectation that every woman should have parental feelings. All this comes out through the story of Leda (the peerless Olivia Colman) who is on holiday alone at a Greek seaside village. The appearance of Dakota Johnson’s unhappy young mum forces memories of Leda’s choices into the present (Jessie Buckley plays Leda in flashbacks) and reawakens her pain. Simon Wardell Coco (Lee Unkrich, 2017) 2.40pm, BBC OneMexico’s annual Day of the Dead celebrations provide fruitful subject matter for Pixar’s blend of joy and nous in this entertaining 2017 animated fantasy. Aspiring young musician Miguel is trying to find out more about his supposed great-great-grandfather (father to his beloved relative Coco) but after a magical trick he finds himself in the world of the dead. It’s a race against time to find his ancestor before he is trapped there for ever. For a story about living with death, Lee Unkrich’s film is a remarkably cheery experience, with a soundtrack of fantastic Latin tunes. SW When Harry Met Sally (Rob Reiner, 1989), 10.40pm, BBC FourTonight’s scheduling of Rob Reiner’s 1989 romcom is no accident – its climactic scene (no spoilers) should occur around the time real-world folk are singing in the new year.

12/31/2021,"It was New Year’s Eve, and we were in an unheated stone hut. Adam and I had hit it off at a silent meditation retreat in Minneapolis, and I’d invited him to spend Christmas break with me in India. At the time, ringing in 2018 in a little village framed by the granite formations and snow-streaked peaks of the Himalayas had seemed like a fairytale. But that night the mercury dipped so low that my vital organs muttered “system failure” and powered down. I buried myself under quilts with concrete-level cotton padding. “It’s 7pm,” Adam protested.  I moulded my frozen lips into a passable version of “goodnight” and passed out. I woke up feeling strangely disoriented, like I’d been asleep for a hundred years. “Adam?” I said. No answer. I felt along the bed. No Adam. For a second, I panicked. Had I really pulled a Sleeping Beauty? How long had I been out? I groped for my phone. It was 11.20pm. “Where are you?” I texted. I poked my head out of the door of the hut. “Adam?” I called out into the night. Prayer flags snapped in the wind. I rang his phone, feeling forlorn. No answer. My redheaded Prince Charming was seriously MIA. Was he taking a walk? I’d warned him about the stray dogs here – docile by day, feral at night. A week ago, I’d seen men wash blood off the road where the beasts had attacked a tourist. Last year, a friend had been bitten in the calf. Was Adam in an alley somewhere, rabid dogs feeding on his face? Did I need to go and rescue him? I really don’t want to do this, I thought, as I shoved on my coat, grabbed a stick and opened the gate. You’d better be dying. I started a slow sideways creep down the hill, my heart pounding drumbeats into my ears, my eyes darting left and right for murderous dogs. To my relief, I saw none. Maybe they were having a New Year’s Eve celebration. Or maybe they were busy feasting … on Adam. I shook the image out of my head, picked up the pace and continued walking. Just then, a low growl sounded at my back. I turned. Six yellow eyes glinted from a few feet away. I froze. Stupid, stupid, I thought. Now I’m dog chowder, too. Tentatively, I wagged the stick at them. They growled louder. If they lunge at me, I thought, I’ll just whirl my stick Crouching Tiger style and send them flying. Eh, who was I kidding? The blood they’d clean from the pavement would 100% be mine. Wasn’t the prince supposed to rescue the princess? Why was I the one facing the hounds of hell alone? The phone pinged. It was Adam. “Hey sweetie,” he wrote. “I’m at the cafe. They’re having a new year party!” “You WHAT?” I screamed. “You inconsiderate jerk!” The dogs backed away. “I thought you were dead!” The dogs turned and fled. “He’s gonna wish he’d met the dogs instead,” I muttered as I stalked down the road. I entered the cafe, which glowed with candlelight. People were laughing and chattering around a long table, decorated with boughs of juniper and plates of chocolate cake. The smells of cider and champagne warmed the room. Adam looked up, his face flushed. “Hey, baby, you came,” he said. “Don’t talk to me,” I said, flinging myself into a chair. “I hate you more than life itself.” “But why?” He laughed, spooning molten lava cake into my mouth. “I didn’t want to wake you.” “Are you familiar with the concept of leaving a note?” I glared at him. Already, though, my anger was waning. I was getting warmer. There was chocolate. I was not missing any limbs. And I had been pretty brave, all things considered. The countdown began. “Happy new year!” we yelled. Bangs filled the air as we pulled crackers, and streamers flew everywhere. The dogs outside howled. “To Prince Charming,” I toasted. As Adam’s eyes lit up, I decided not to ruin the moment by telling him I’d meant me. And, although this fairytale romance didn’t make it past spring, I was forever grateful to realise that I didn’t need a white knight to slay my dragons.",Lifestyle/Life and style,My winter of love: I went to rescue my boyfriend from rabid dogs – and realised how brave I was,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/31/my-winter-of-love-rescued-my-partner-from-rabid-dogs
12/31/2021,"Two newcomers become glorious movie stars in this comedy from Paul Thomas Anderson, set in 1970s Los Angeles. Cooper Hoffman (son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a fast-talking high-school kid with the nerve to start hitting on a 25-year-old woman – played by Alana Haim (of the pop band Haim), who has Barbra Streisand’s charisma and beauty. Their strange semi-platonic love affair plays out against this kid’s floundering dual careers as a child actor and waterbed salesman. Gorgeously made, with wonderful cameos from Bradley Cooper and Sean Penn. Released in the UK on 1 January  The title couldn’t more ironic. This subtle film from Iranian auteur Asghar Farhadi is about slippery Rahim (Amir Jadidi), imprisoned for debt and allowed out of prison on a weekend pass. His girlfriend has found some apparently valuable gold coins in the street: Rahim plans to sell them and give the money to his creditor to cancel his sentence. But when they turn out to be worth much less than he thought, Rahim cooks up an alternative scam to impress a charitable foundation: pretend he was always going to hand the coins back to their owner. 7 January Audiences will experience a kind of agribusiness pastoral in this immersive documentary from Andrea Arnold, who takes us up close and personal with cows on a farm as they moo and trot around and give birth and stare with profoundly mysterious placidity into the camera. Arnold gets alongside her bovine stars as they give birth, and we don’t see any humans until right at the very end, when we must confront the cows’ awful destiny at the hands of the human carnivores. There is great poignancy and intimacy here. 14 January The artist and Palme d’Or-winning film-maker Apichatpong Weerasethakul gives us his first movie from outside Thailand: a strange, exalted, visionary work. Tilda Swinton stars as a British expat in Colombia plagued by hallucinatory sounds. Her search for their meaning leads her to an unearthly epiphany. Weerasethakul is a director concerned with the unsolved and unspoken mysteries of existence. Memoria is a beautiful and enigmatic picture – cinema that decelerates your pulse. 14 January There’s such terrific warmth and tenderness to Kenneth Branagh’s movie about the Belfast of his childhood: spryly written, beautifully acted, and shot in a lustrous monochrome. This is a film consciously without the anger and despair generally considered indispensable for movies about the Troubles. Instead, we get generosity and wit. Jamie Dornan plays a Protestant carpenter who lives with his old mum and dad (Ciarán Hinds and Judi Dench), his wife (Caitriona Balfe) and sons (Jude Hill and Lewis McAskie). As the political situation gets worse, he must figure out how and when to leave Belfast. 21 January Guillermo Del Toro gives his rich and exotic imagination full rein in this supercharged noir, a new version of the pulp shocker by William Lindsay Gresham, first filmed by Edmund Goulding in 1947 with Tyrone Power in the sleazy lead role. Now it’s Bradley Cooper playing Stan, a criminal who needs to vanish into the underground and gets a job with a travelling troupe of carnies and con-men. The film shows us how his whole life is a fascinatingly tacky illusion heading for disaster. 21 January The energy and creativity of Pedro Almodóvar continues to be a marvel. This new film is a baby-swap melodrama – at least on the surface. Penélope Cruz plays Janis, pregnant and determined to go it alone as a single mum; she befriends teen Ana (Milena Smit) who has the same idea, though without Janis’s resources. Their babies get accidentally mixed up; their lives are intertwined; nature, nurture and ancestral burdens combine as a subplot tackles Spanish trauma over the civil war. 28 January Here’s a social-realist love story from director Clio Barnard, set in Bradford, which is being compared to Ken Loach’s Ae Fond Kiss. Adeel Akhtar plays a likable, happy-go-lucky South Asian guy called Ali, who is secretly depressed at the end of his marriage. Then he runs into Ava, a white woman from an Irish background, recently widowed, whose late husband was an abusive bully. She’s a sweet-natured soul looking for human warmth, and she and Ali fall for each other. The film is an essay in acceptance and love. 4 February Jessica Chastain gives it her very considerable all in this biopic of televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker, the devoted wife of notorious fellow preacher, huckster and fraudster Jim Bakker. She learned her commercial vocation in the Lord from him and was utterly committed to their dual lifestyles of righteousness and wealth. But Tammy was also sincere and thoughtful in her own way, and was committed to LGBTQ+ rights in a style that the Christian right did not espouse. 4 February One of Britain’s pre-eminent new film-makers has elevated her reputation still further with the second part of her luminous autobiographical movie: a self-portrait of the artist as a young woman. Writer-director Joanna Hogg fictionalises herself as the insouciantly well-off film student Julie, played by Honor Swinton Byrne, now recovering from her destructive amour fou with the complicated man called Anthony we saw in the first film. Now she is planning to alchemise that pain into a movie. 4 February African cinema is represented this year by the great Chadian director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, part of his continent’s great quietist, walking-pace tradition of film-making. Lingui is a Chadian word meaning “sacred bonds” – between man and woman, mother and child. These are tested when Amina, a woman who has to pretend her husband is dead to avoid scandal, finds that her teen daughter is pregnant and in the same situation that she was in not so very long ago. 4 February When Kenneth Branagh had an enormous hit with his 2017 version of Murder on the Orient Express, starring himself as the Belgian sleuth Poirot, British cinema re-learned a great truth: Agatha Christie is gigantic box-office. So now Branagh has done the same thing with Death on the Nile (which, like MOTOE, was a 70s movie hit), returning as Poirot and leading an all-star cast including Gal Gadot, Annette Bening, Sophie Okonedo and Armie Hammer. 11 February Here is the last movie from the late Roger Michell, the director who died in September – and it could be his masterpiece: a true-crime comedy of British manners about a politically motivated art theft in 1960s Britain, which tweaked the nose of the pompous establishment. Jim Broadbent plays plain-speaking northern socialist and chancer Kempton Bunton and Helen Mirren is his wife, Dorothy. Kempton is outraged when public money is spent on saving Goya’s Duke of Wellington portrait for the nation when it could have been spent on needy working people. So he steals it from the National Gallery, a chaotic caper which electrified the country. 25 February The definite article was first appended to Batman’s name in the Christopher Nolan era as an indicator of something thrillingly primitive and elemental. Now it’s actually going in the title. Robert Pattinson wears the pointy-eared mask. Has he been bulking up in the gym to match Christian Bale’s presence? Or will this be a slighter, wirier Batman? At all events, he faces the giggling conundrum-creator of Gotham City, the Riddler, played by Paul Dano. Meanwhile, the Penguin is an unrecognisable Colin Farrell. 4 March Jacques Audiard’s freewheeling ensemble picture about Parisians in love – and set in the treizième – deserved more awards in Cannes than it actually got. It’s adapted from American stories by the graphic artist Adrian Tomine, transplanted to France. A young woman living rent-free in her dementia-stricken grandma’s flat has a tricky relationship with her roommate-with-benefits, who in turn has a tumultuous row with his kid sister over her plan to be a standup comic. Another young woman is mistaken for an online sex worker, and turns to the real thing for help. The zinging energy of this film is a marvel. 4 March Festival audiences have been thrilled by this in-depth documentary, which returns to the eternally fascinating subject of Charlie Chaplin, the movie legend and former workhouse inmate whom Dickens would have loved and understood. He was the cinema genius who became the world’s first and arguably most pervasive global celebrity in an era when silent cinema was understood by everyone. But during the second world war, he was punished by the US government for his outspoken leftist politics, and became an exile in Europe. 4 March The year’s best romantic comedy comes from the most unexpected source. Norwegian director Joachim Trier is known for his shocking and challenging dramas; now he has created a lovely relationship comedy in the tradition of Nora Ephron and David Nicholls. Renate Reinsve plays the heroine, Julie, and the movie breaks down her troubled romantic history. She hooks up with a rebellious graphic artist, played by Anders Danielsen Lie, and then cheats on him with a humble shop assistant. It’s a sweet and funny film that insists on the importance of the romcom questions: who should you fall in love with? Who is the one? 25 March There’s a great tradition of train journeys on film and this is a gem. Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen has created a charming 90s-set love story from unpromising elements. Laura is a sweet-natured young Finnish student of archaeology, in retreat from a stagnant affair with her professor, who embarks on an epic rail journey from Moscow to freezing Murmansk to view some mysterious rock drawings, thousands of years old. And in compartment No 6, she meets boorish, drunken, obnoxious Vadim, who starts out looking like a tough guy and ends up being the sensitive soul that she needs. 1 April François Ozon brings us a beautifully crafted example of French cinema: an affecting but unsentimental film about assisted dying. Veteran character actor André Dussollier plays André, a wealthy and well-connected industrialist who is suddenly reduced to a shadow of himself after suffering a stroke. His daughter Manue, excellently played by Sophie Marceau, has difficult memories of his cruelty during her childhood and even fantasised about killing him. So it is with mixed feelings that she receives the news he wants her to organise his euthanasia in Switzerland. 22 April One of the most extraordinary stories of the second world war is retold, adapted from the bestseller by Ben Macintyre. To conceal the Allied plan to invade Sicily in 1943, British intelligence officers took the body of a dead homeless man, dressed him up in a captain’s uniform and placed on him bogus documents detailing non-existent plans to invade via Greece and Sardinia. Then they allowed the body to wash up on the Spanish coast, confident it would be passed on to the Nazis, who would assume pure chance had given them their enemies’ secret plans. Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen star. 22 April Paul Verhoeven is a director whose wildly over-the-top creations have long been subject to revisionist cinephile praise, but there has been a division of opinion over this new nunsploitation romp – based on the true story of a 17th-century French abbess, Benedetta (played by the estimable Virginie Efira), who was stripped of her authority because of her relationship with a fellow nun. There is much raunchiness here. Is it Showgirls in wimples? Kinda. For Verhoeven partisans, who insist the mockers and the nay-sayers just don’t get it, this is the whole point. 22 April Still speedy, still needy, still eerily boyish, Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell returns in this present-day sequel to Top Gun. The US navy airman played by Tom Cruise could be piloting a desk by now, but he prefers to be a badass warrior of the skies. Jennifer Connelly plays Maverick’s love interest, a mere nine years Cruise’s junior. Miles Teller plays Rooster Bradshaw, the son of Goose Bradshaw from the first film, who was played by Anthony Edwards. Could it be that this film will include the homoeroticism famously imagined by Top Gun superfans Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino? Probably not. 27 May Tom Hanks plays Colonel Tom Parker, the notoriously super-controlling manager of Elvis Presley, in this new biopic of Elvis directed and co-written by Baz Luhrmann – and we can expect some storytelling fireworks from this high-energy film-maker. Austin Butler (who was the creepy Manson follower Tex in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) plays Elvis – though it is not yet clear if he will be doing his own singing. 24 June The chilling Port Arthur massacre of 1996 was one of the worst examples of mass murder in Australian history, and now director Justin Kurzel has made this movie about the stranger-than-fiction life-story of the killer, Martin Bryant, starting with the nasty nickname he acquired at school: “Nitram” – “Martin” spelled backwards. Having been let down by his parents, Bryant was bizarrely befriended and taken in by a wealthy and reclusive heiress (played by Essie Davis), who put him in her will before dying in questionable circumstances – making Bryant rich enough to indulge his passion for guns. 15 July The non-appearing No Time to Die achieved a kind of mythic status during the lockdown. Something of the sort has also happened to Mission Impossible: 7, the long-awaited latest in the action-adventure series with Tom Cruise as daredevil Ethan Hunt – chiefly because of an illicit audio recording that surfaced in December 2020, in which an extremely stressed Cruise can be heard berating the UK crew for not observing social-distancing rules. Can anything in the film be as exciting as that? We must hope so. 30 September UK release dates may change",Arts/Film,"Chaplin, Elvis and Batman return: 25 films to look out for in 2022",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/31/films-2022-must-see-movies-chaplin-elvis-batman
12/31/2021,"Consumers splashed out on online shopping, takeaways, home improvements and streaming subscriptions in 2021, as ongoing Covid restrictions limited where people could spend their money. Households were more willing to splash their cash in 2021, and spending during the year was almost 6% higher than in 2019, according to a review of transactions by Barclaycard.  While non-essential shops remained closed at the start of the year, consumers spent their money online instead. Online retail spending surged by almost 88% in March 2021, compared with 2019, when it accounted for over half (52%) of all retail spend. Spending on essential items rose by 11% over the 12 months, largely driven by supermarket shopping, which grew by more than 17%, as restaurants, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues remained closed for several months of the year. Spending on takeaways and fast food climbed by 62%. Consumers also spent considerably more on home entertainment, including on digital content and subscriptions, which rose by 47%, and electronics, which saw a 10% uplift in spending. Online grocery shopping, a trend which looks set to continue beyond the pandemic, surged by over 97% during the year. The highest increase of the year in online grocery spending came in March, when it climbed by almost 120%, as many consumers relied on deliveries from food retailers. While many locked-down households turned their attention to home improvements during 2021, some also added an extra member in the form of a pet, boosting spending at vets and pet retailers, which was almost a third (29%) higher than in 2019. When Covid restrictions were eased during the spring, many cooped-up consumers chose to go on holiday, although many of those remained in the UK, amid continued restrictions on international travel. Barclaycard, which reports seeing around half of the nation’s debit and credit card transactions, said spending on hotels, resorts and accommodation grew for the first time since the start of the pandemic in June 2021, reaching a peak of a nearly 16% increase in spending in August. The outlook for consumer spending over the coming year remains uncertain amid rising Covid cases, according to Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard. “As we look ahead to 2022, the economy will face fresh challenges from rising household bills, inflation, and uncertainty about the new Covid variant,” Carvalho said. “Yet, as we’ve seen over the last two years, consumers and businesses are capable of adapting to and overcoming immense hardship and adversity”. As the UK enters the third year of the pandemic, spending on holidays is forecast to be a top priority for 2022, according to new research from Goldman Sachs’ online bank Marcus. It found over a third (34%) of consumers were planning to spend more on trips in the coming year, up from 22% in 2021, while 30% of those surveyed said they expected to spend less on takeaways.",News/Business,"Online shopping, pets and takeaways fuel surge in UK spending in 2021",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/31/online-shopping-pets-and-takeaways-fuel-surge-in-uk-spending-in-2021
12/31/2021,"“I said: wouldn’t it be a good idea to get people from all round the world to crochet or knit some Roman-themed bunting,” says Lynne Barber, recalling her pitch to organisers of a year-long festival celebrating Hadrian’s Wall. “They said: ‘That’s fantastic! Will you organise it?’” Barber, an undertaker, is smiling as she talks about the rather daunting challenge ahead of her. The bunting may not end up stretching all the 73 miles (118km) of the wall, but she is hopeful of managing to get a flag for every year that it has existed.  Hers is one of a blizzard of newly announced projects planned for the Hadrian’s Wall 1900 festival, a year-long jamboree marking the anniversary of the Roman empire’s north-west frontier, built from what is now Wallsend on the Tyne to Bowness-on-Solway in Cumbria. Because there are so many aspects to the wall – history, archaeology, nature, walking – the planned exhibitions, arts events, concerts and more are strikingly diverse. Bill Griffiths, who is chair of the 1900 festival, says an early decision was made: “Let’s not do what we’ve done before. Let’s not make it about museums. Let’s make it about people and the communities on Hadrian’s Wall. It is their wall, it is not the preserve of curators.” Griffiths says there is a romance and magic to the wall, and while it may be 1,900 years old, there is still much to learn. “There are new discoveries all of the time. Every time you think it’s fixed, something shifts. We only realised it was Hadrian’s Wall just under 200 years ago.” Before that, Griffiths says, it was thought that Severus, the African emperor of Rome, built the wall. Another, as yet unresolved, debate is whether the wall had a walkway on top of it. “There is no proof,” says Griffiths. “I’m a believer in it having a wall walk, but I have to say ‘believer’ … there is no hard evidence.” If the wall isn’t interesting enough then you have Hadrian himself. Tactically astute, he is seen as a consolidating emperor, with one of his first acts being to withdraw troops from Iraq. He is also widely acknowledged as a gay emperor; a man devastated by the death of a beautiful Greek boy called Antinous. Griffiths, who fell in love with Roman history thanks to the Asterix comics, says his passion is learning how the Roman army operated, how it had garrison units on the wall whose soldiers came from as far as Africa, Syria, Romania and Belgium. “The wall is endlessly fascinating; the trick is to make it appealing to the public,” he says. “I find it fascinating, I can’t imagine others won’t, but some don’t. That’s not because it’s boring, it’s because we haven’t found the right stories to engross people with.” The festival team put out an open call for people and organisations to submit ideas and have so far received 170 proposals. The idea is that the festival will be able to help with fundraising, marketing and sustainability, “but you’re responsible for your events,” says Griffiths. It has to be that way because the core festival team is a small one, each of them with day jobs. In Griffiths’ case he remains head of programmes and collections at Tyne and Wear museums. The events announced include a Hadrian’s Wall manga novel, an exhibition at Segedunum Roman fort and museum exploring who built the wall and how, and a new play in village halls by On the Move theatre set in AD121. And then there is the bunting challenge conceived by Barber, who lives in South Shields, home to the Arbeia Roman fort, which guarded the entrance to the Tyne and served as a supply centre for the thousands of troops stationed on the wall. Barber took up crochet 18 years ago after stopping smoking and has never looked back. “Hadrian’s Wall is famous around the world so I’m hoping people from lots of countries will send flags in,” she says. “I think people do get inspired by the wall. It will be nice to see where they all come from.” Barber has made simple, free Roman numeral and Roman shield patterns that people will be able to download, and is being helped with the project by the Vindolanda Charitable Trust. It’s early days, but the confirmed crochet fan Tom Daley is on the list of dream contributors. The festival will begin on Hadrian’s birthday, 24 January, and run until the end of the Roman festival of Saturnalia on 23 December.",News/UK news,From manga to bunting: year-long festival to celebrate Hadrian’s Wall,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/festival-to-celebrate-hadrians-wall-1900-2022
12/31/2021,"As dawn broke on the first morning of 2021, dark storm clouds hung over Britain’s economic landscape. Hospitality, aviation and tourism had been at a standstill for much of the previous year, while high street retail had fared only a little better. A winter Covid-19 surge heralded yet another punishing lockdown and, as if that wasn’t enough, Brexit was crimping Britain’s international trade. Consumer confidence languished at rock bottom with no end to the pandemic in sight.  Twelve months on, the world of business and finance has been on a rollercoaster ride, flitting from summer optimism to autumn supply chain chaos, before the Omicron variant of Covid-19 brought us back down to earth with a chastening bump. In some respects, things are looking up. In others, it feels like we’re right back where we started. As Britain battles to recover from the pandemic body blow, here’s how the year unfolded. Pings, petrol panic and supply chain pandemonium The neologism of 2021 was surely “pingdemic”. Covid-19 restrictions were fully lifted on 19 July, unshackling large swathes of the economy in readiness for a summer rebound. But already workers who had been near to someone who later tested positive were being “pinged” with alerts from the NHS Covid-19 app, forcing tens of thousands to self-isolate. The trend caused massive disruption, affecting everyone from independent restaurants and shops to the likes of Asos, Rolls-Royce and Nissan. The relaxation of self-isolation rules eased the problem somewhat, but it was far from the last setback to the UK’s recovery. Ping or no ping, labour supply issues persisted, due partly to the pandemic and partly to a dearth of overseas workers caused by Brexit. Sectors from farming to hospitality struggled with staff shortages, but nowhere were the effects more visible than in the deficit of HGV drivers. New rules for EU hauliers, coupled with poor working conditions, red tape and a backlog at driving test centres, left the UK with a stark deficit of people qualified to get behind the wheel of delivery lorries. Supermarket shelves began to look sparse and stores including Tesco and Sainsbury’s even resorted to hiding the gaps with pictures of asparagus, carrots, oranges and grapes. Perhaps the most striking consequence was the chaos at the petrol pumps. After BP warned in September that it didn’t have enough tanker drivers to deliver fuel to some forecourts, its concerns became a self-fulfilling prophecy as panic-buying caused many forecourts to run dry for days at a time. The crisis soon subsided but underlying supply chain problems remain an ever-present threat. Gas prices, energy suppliers coal and Cop26 Alongside the fuel panic, the UK experienced a second autumn energy crisis, one made all the more poignant by the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. Wholesale gas and electricity prices began a prolonged surge from September on the back of a mix of factors including increased demand as countries unlocked, Russian restrictions on pipeline flows to Europe and low renewable power generation. Energy suppliers collapsed like dominos as the market price for gas far outstripped what customers were paying under the government-imposed energy price cap. Between August and December, 25 went under: the largest was the “too good to be true” green supplier Bulb Energy, with 1.6 million customers, which became the first to enter the government’s “special administration” scheme for energy providers. The chain of failures has led to widespread calls for a rethink of the regulatory system that aimed to encourage competition by allowing smaller players to enter the market. It wasn’t just suppliers that were hit. Sectors that use a lot of energy, such as steel, glass and chemicals, were brought to the brink of shutting down by the high cost of gas and electricity. Two fertiliser plants did stop operations, forcing the government to step in to help their owner, CF Fertiliser. Its two plants supply about 60% of the UK’s carbon dioxide, which is vital for the food and drink supply chain. Luckily, the Cop26 summit was on hand to map out a path towards decreased reliance on fossil fuels. Opinion was divided on its success. Boris Johnson hailed a “big step forward”, but commitments from China and India on coal phase-out didn’t go far enough for many. Cop26’s biggest winner was surely AG Barr, the owner of Irn-Bru, which seemed to garner as many mentions as climate change. Rows, trials and scandals One of the year’s most acrimonious disputes came at the very start, as the European Union and AstraZeneca clashed over claims that the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant had reneged on its promise to deliver jabs. The row went to court before being settled in September after the firm agreed to deliver 200m doses by March 2022. Also crying foul were politicians and campaigners who had hoped that the northern leg of HS2 would help boost economic growth in part of the country hampered by poor connectivity. In the end, the government’s scaled-back Integrated Rail Plan published in November ditched the proposed spur from Birmingham to Leeds, prompting accusations that the plan was not so much rail as betrayal. The return of international travel in the summer was great news for tour operators and airlines but there was frustration among holidaymakers at the service offered by the host of firms that sprang up selling the required PCR testing kits. Many appeared to have been incorporated hurriedly to cash in on new market. After many tales of poor service and withheld refunds, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, vowed to crack down on “cowboy” firms. Two of the year’s biggest scandals starkly illustrated the gulf between the powerful and the voiceless. One was the Greensill affair, in which it emerged that the Australian financier Lex Greensill had been ushered into the heart of David Cameron’s government, where he appeared to have enjoyed carte blanche to insert his company into government procurement contracts, with lucrative results. After Cameron left office, he lobbied for Greensill Capital to receive government emergency support as it hurtled towards collapse. The affair’s fallout includes a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the links between Greensill and Sanjeev Gupta, the man who owns much of the UK steel industry. Rather less powerful than Cameron and Greensill were the hundreds of postmasters wrongfully convicted of offences including theft on the basis of software errors in the Post Office’s IT system. Many had their names belatedly cleared in court this year, and the government has set aside up to £233m to compensate those forced to cover imaginary shortfalls. Many died before their names could be cleared, having had their reputations dragged through the mud by their employer’s aggressive pursuit on incorrect evidence. As the year drew to a close, a jury was deliberating in the trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the US blood testing company Theranos. She denies 11 criminal charges alleging that she duped investors and patients by hailing her company’s technology as a medical breakthrough when results were actually error-strewn. The case has attracted worldwide attention, in part due to the incredible rise-and-fall narrative of Holmes, who started Theranos as a 19-year-old college dropout and became a paper billionaire before the company’s collapse. Digital currency and meme stocks At the very start of the year, the Tesla boss, Elon Musk, became the world’s richest man, overtaking Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, as shares in the electric vehicle-maker soared on the back of hopes that a Democrat-controlled US Senate would lead to better conditions for green technology. The increase pushed Musk’s net worth to £136bn. Musk displayed an uncanny ability to move markets with a comment on Twitter. When the billionaire space-botherer said Tesla would resume accepting payment in bitcoin, the value of the currency moved past $40,000. Even without Musk’s rocket fuel, bitcoin continued its rise, soaring above an all-time high of $68,000 in November. Even Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency invented as a joke, offered the promise of major returns, surging 14,000% between January and May. The Bank of England has since warned that bitcoin could end up worthless, but in truth its future is anybody’s guess. The growing influence of social media on markets was further evidenced by the emergence of “meme stocks” – shares that attract investment purely thanks to online hype. The archetypal example was GameStop, a bricks-and-mortar video games outlet that offered little as an investment prospect until small traders latched on to it in January in a vigilante effort to squeeze hedge funds that had bet against it. The trend has caused wild fluctuations in GameStop and other meme stocks. One London-based hedge fund, White Square, was even driven under. The phenomenon was fuelled by web forums such as Reddit and the growing trend for small investors to dabble in securities via trading apps such as Robinhood and eToro. Deals, takeovers and market moves As new technology flexed its muscles, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, sought to make Britain more attractive for innovative companies to float in London by loosening listing rules. Deliveroo was a poster child for the policy but its float duly flopped. More established UK names proved more attractive, attracting the attention of deep-pocketed private equity buyers. The supermarket chain Morrisons succumbed to a £6.9bn takeover by the US firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). American buyout houses also took aim at the outsourcer G4S, the infrastructure builder John Laing and the defence companies Meggitt and Ultra Electronics. Perhaps the most controversial takeover had nothing to do with private equity. The asthma inhaler maker Vectura was snapped up for £1.1bn by the cigarette company Philip Morris International. The tobacco firm claimed the deal was part of its switch to a “smoke-free future” but anti-smoking groups were up in arms and several medical conferences cut ties with Vectura after the deal. For the FTSE100 it was a year of recovery. An initial slump was followed by gains that saw the blue-chip index finally return to its pre-pandemic crash level in the year’s final week. Politics and economics Rarely has the cosy nexus between business and politics been under more scrutiny than in 2021. The PCR test supplier Randox found itself at the centre of a row over lobbying done on its behalf by its adviser, the Conservative MP Owen Paterson, which was first revealed by the Guardian. Meanwhile, it emerged that firms who had MPs on speed dial had been moved into “VIP lanes” for Covid contracts. But for much of the business community, relations with government were strained, raising question marks over the Tories’ claim to be the “party of business”. First there was a Brexit-related plunge in trade during January, then the announcement of an upcoming rise in corporation tax to 25% and a national insurance hike to fund health and social care, which has been condemned as a tax on workers. The economy grew sharply from the depths plumbed in 2020 but the recovery remains fragile. What the business community needed was a strong signal from government that there was a plan, a firm hand at the tiller, some certainty to cling to. What they got, courtesy of Boris Johnson’s address to the annual CBI dinner, was a semi-incoherent “car crash” of a speech that had journalists asking if the prime minister was OK. He rambled about the children’s TV character Peppa Pig for several minutes, impersonated a car – complete with “vroom vroom” noises – and at one stage lost his place, leaving the audience to squirm at the uncomfortable dead air punctuated by the occasional “erm” and “forgive me”. Some things have gone better. Unemployment has remained surprisingly low at 4.2% despite the end of the furlough scheme. But as 2021 draws to a close, major concerns remain. Inflation is at a 10-year high of 5.1%, well above the Bank of England’s target, with little sign of abatement. Brexit remains a drag, with an Institute of Directors survey finding one-third of affected members saying they aren’t ready for stricter customs checks that come into effect on 1 January 2022. Meanwhile, the surge in Omicron cases means that pubs, bars and restaurants are ending 2021 more or less where they started it, unable to trade profitably, if at all. Here’s to a happier 2022.",News/Business,"The ups and downs of business, politics and economics in 2021",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/31/the-ups-and-downs-of-business-politics-and-economics-in-2021
12/31/2021,"Since Brexit, saying you represent the people against the establishment has been one of the most effective moves in British politics. In a country with little respect for politicians but still some reverence for voters, however erratic or flimsily based their opinions, invoking the people is one of the few reliable ways to achieve political momentum. Despite the fact that in parliament, the press and much of business the Conservatives and their allies are the establishment – and have been since at least 2010 – this populist rhetoric has mostly been used by the right. However out of touch and contemptuous of democracy his government is in practice, Boris Johnson claims to speak for the people at every opportunity.  In recent years Labour has rarely dared to do likewise, except during the most energised moments of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, such as his campaigning “for the many” in the 2017 election. The party has been too lacking in confidence, too inward-looking – and simply too unpopular – to argue that its views and those of the country are in harmony. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour rarely assumes that its periods of success represent British politics in its natural state. So the fact that this month Keir Starmer has started talking about “the national interest” and “the British people”, and trying to associate his party with them, feels significant. It suggests that after more than 18 months of cautious and defensive leadership – much of it taken up with sidelining colleagues and policies supposedly too radical for the public – Starmer finally believes that Labour can speak for the nation without being ridiculed. “We are a patriotic party,” he declared in a TV broadcast supporting the Covid booster campaign, sitting behind a large, would-be prime ministerial desk with a union flag beside him. “The Labour party that I lead will always act in Britain’s best interests.” The clear implication – left unspoken because this was a broadcast officially about public health – was that the Conservatives have much less honourable, more partisan motives. With Boris Johnson in Downing Street, this has become a pretty easy argument to make. So blatantly have his policies been designed to reward friends and punish enemies that even some voters who once tolerated, or even admired, his shameless brand of Conservatism have become repelled. Unlike previous slumps in support for his government, which mainly benefited the Liberal Democrats, many of these Tory voters now appear to be switching to Labour. For the first time under Starmer, this month Labour has achieved large enough leads over the Tories in the polls for a narrow win at the next election – or a hung parliament leading to a Labour-led coalition – to be more than a remote possibility. In the past, a Labour leader adopting expansive patriotic language has sometimes been a sign of an imminent electoral breakthrough. During a campaign broadcast before the party’s great victory at the 1945 election, Clement Attlee argued that, unlike the Tories, Labour represented “a good cross-section of the nation”: both rural and urban Britons, employers and employees. Labour’s share of the vote at that general election and the next two was not far short of 50%: huge by today’s standards, and large enough to justify Attlee’s claim. During the early years of Tony Blair’s leadership, Labour was almost as popular, and he often talked about “the people” reverently but also a little proprietorially – as if only he and his party understood or could carry out their wishes. Like Attlee, Blair led a government whose initial breadth of support right across England, Scotland and Wales was on a scale that makes Johnson’s supposedly decisive electoral mandate in 2019 look narrow. One way to interpret Starmer’s still rather opaque leadership is as an attempt to apply the methods of the Blair and Attlee eras to today’s world. Starmer’s stern, rather formal manner, austere suits and haircut, and talk of a “shared national duty” all suggest a Labour politician from the 1940s. Meanwhile his recruitment of New Labour veterans such as Yvette Cooper and Deborah Mattinson and his bash-the-left approach to party management imply that Starmer still has faith in the controlling centrist politics of the 00s. Given that these are the only two periods when Labour has achieved lasting dominance (Harold Wilson’s election wins in the 1960s and 1970s were much less decisive), taking Blair and Attlee as role models seems reasonable, on the face of it. The fact that both led relatively competent governments with substantial domestic achievements – at least until they got involved in too many foreign wars – is also likely to appeal to Starmer. If he becomes prime minister, in what will probably be tough circumstances, he will be desperate to prove to voters that chaotic 21st-century government is a purely Conservative phenomenon. But there is also a danger for Starmer in trying to sound and act like Blair and Attlee. It risks drawing attention to the great difference in strength between their political positions as Labour leaders and his. Only a few months ago, much of the talk at the Labour conference was about who was going to replace Starmer, after months of bad election results and personal ratings, bodged Labour reorganisations and barely noticed policy launches. Inside as well as outside the party, Starmer was widely written off as a wooden and uncharismatic figure, unsuited to top-level politics: “a plodder”, as someone who has had decades of dealings with Labour put it to me. Starmer’s performance has improved a little since. He is more aggressive in his attacks on the Conservatives, using franker words such as “corruption” and allowing flashes of anger to enliven his usually too controlled courtroom manner. And he seems more confident, as if relieved that his painstakingly assembled case against the government is finally being heard. Yet most of his limitations as a politician have not gone away. The improvement in Labour’s position is not because he is doing his job much better, but because the government is doing its even worse. And when he declares that only his party can serve “the people” and “the national interest”, he echoes not only Blair and Attlee but also other, less successful Labour leaders, such as Neil Kinnock, who often seemed to assert their patriotism not from a position of strength but of weakness: in a vain attempt to convince the Tory press and sceptical voters that Labour was respectable and not an alien threat. A more assured and rooted party – which was able to explain why Britain would benefit from regular rather than occasional left-of-centre governments – would not have to perpetually prove its right to exist. Will Starmer end up as one of Labour’s patriotic failures? The jury is still out.

12/31/2021,"Meeting legal limits for air pollution can seem impossibly difficult but understanding the links between our environmental problems, and tackling them together, can simplify attempts to find solutions. For example, our polluted roads and rivers are connected by runoff from street drains, and the road traffic that pollutes our air also produces noise that disturbs our peace. Tyre fragments and the plastic litter ground up by traffic on our streets ends up in our air and oceans.  Investing in local shops and services can help us swap motorised traffic for walking and cycling, improve neighbourhoods, help the climate crisis and air pollution, as well as improve our health through daily exercise. As for net zero, diesel cars and wood burning have been serious mistakes for air pollution and are not helping our climate. Speaking to the Conservative Environment Network in December, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister Jo Churchill called for cross-government and cross-society action to tackle air pollution. While initiatives such as the UK Clean Air Programme try to bridge research boundaries, it is difficult for researchers, civil servants and local government to join together our environmental problems without a strategic framework. It is 10 years since the abolition of the independent royal commission on environmental pollution. Set up in 1970, it had a wide remit to investigate national and international pollution issues and to warn of future dangers. Its reports were heavily solutions-based and had direct impact on government policy. The commission’s 1983 report on lead in petrol was immediately followed by changes in UK law, as was its 1989 report on genetically modified organisms. The commission’s recommendation for a long-term CO2 reduction target was accepted by government in 2000 and the EU-wide environmental regulation of polluting industries and waste stems from its recommendations. Noel Nelson, part of the civil service team that worked with the commission, said: “Although members were all experts in their own fields, the best solutions were seldom found in any one discipline.” Today, the absence of an independent, strategic view of environmental evidence leaves us vulnerable to missed opportunities. Do we need a new royal commission? Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, a former commission member, said: “Since the dissolution of the commission in 2011, the number and complexity of environmental challenges in our changing world has greatly increased. Examples include: the transition to zero carbon, changing environment and zoonotic infectious disease, addressing water pollution, citizen science to monitor and improve the environment and how to harness and work with the environment to improve health and wellbeing. These require imaginative analysis leading to multiple solutions-based outcomes.”",News/Environment,Do we need a new royal commission to monitor pollution?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/31/should-we-reinstate-royal-commission-to-monitor-pollution
12/31/2021,"“I remember thinking as a kid: I can’t wait till I grow up,” says Paul Thomas Anderson. “I can’t wait till I get older and I can shed all this stuff, and all the answers will be there for me.” America’s best director is now 51: salt-and-pepper hair, still as loose-limbed as a student. Those answers are yet to materialise, he says, grinning. “No one sets you up for that. My dad never said: ‘Oh, by the way, it’s going to get a lot more complicated and a lot harder.’ Or: ‘Being in love and having a relationship is going to be the most difficult challenge of your life.’ I don’t know why. Maybe it was just my dad.”  Dissent from down the sofa: Alana Haim, the rock musician who stars in Anderson’s new movie. “Ignorance is bliss!” she cries. Nobody told her that stuff either – of course not. “Parents just want a happy kid.” They laugh: not quite father-daughter, but close. It’s a freezing morning in November, back before Omicron, when film stars still flew to London for screenings and even took off their masks to speak. Outside the window, a neon fawn is strung between lampposts in Covent Garden. The promise of a proper Christmas glints in the air. Licorice Pizza, too, is a nostalgia trip: romantic, relaxed, exhilaratingly cinematic, stuffed with big skies and unvarnished closeups that seem even more amazing after two years starved of the faces of strangers. Better than Boogie Nights – Anderson’s other film set in the 70s San Fernando Valley of his youth. Less epic than There Will Be Blood. But light years from the heaviness of The Master, the mad tangle of Inherent Vice, the couture austerity of Phantom Thread. Shooting that movie in London five years ago prompted its star, Daniel Day Lewis, to quit not just method acting but the profession for ever, and left its director depressed. Small wonder he made his next movie at home, with friends who had never acted before. Haim and Anderson met nearly a decade back when he emailed her and her sisters to see if they might like him to direct any of their music videos (yes, they replied, and did he realise their mother was his old high-school art teacher?). Her co-star, Cooper Hoffman, is the eldest child of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died aged 46 in 2014, the year after he was Oscar-nominated for The Master, his fifth Anderson movie. “I’ve known Cooper since he was a baby.” Now 18, Hoffman plays Gary Valentine, a 15-year-old former child actor and budding entrepreneur: positive, charismatic, irrepressible. Haim is Alana Kane: 28, abrasive, immature, directionless. They meet. Gary makes a move and, loathing herself for it, she shows up to supper with him. The film charts their friendship over a year: him smitten and her, mostly, resisting. She chaperones him on a trip to New York. They set up a business selling water beds. There are tiffs and splits. Disaster is a frequent tease – false arrest, terrorist scare, some very hairy driving. But cliches are always dodged, right down to the visible acne and the DIY makeup. The leads look outlandish because they look real. Splattered through the story are fabulously hammy big-name cameos. Bradley Cooper as a coked-up Jon Peters, the hairdresser and then-boyfriend of Barbra Streisand. Sean Penn as an egomaniacal A-lister modelled on William Holden, who hits on Haim by intoning random dialogue from his old war movies. Tom Waits as a wild, delusional director. Harriet Sansom Harris as a quivering theatrical agent. John Michael Higgins as a restaurateur who addresses his Japanese wife in a thick east Asian accent, as he himself doesn’t speak the language. This mix – Bresson meets Ferrell – was intentional, says Anderson. “It works because it comes about at the right time. The relationship reaches a certain type of peak and the needle needs to move. They have a fight and then a movie star emerges playing a movie star. It’s not a sharp turn that takes you out of the story. Hopefully it feels quite natural.” “Paul is attracted to actors and trusts them,” says Higgins down the phone a few weeks later. “Real technicians with long résumés, but also people who have no experience. He has an innate feeling there will be emotional information as a result of that contradiction.” Emotional information? “The audience can say: ’That’s me. I see me. This is right, this is real, this is what people are like.’ They’re not easy to explain.” “It feels very much like you’ve been invited over to play,” adds Harris, also down the line. “That’s the best feeling an actor can have and not everybody who has power understands that.” She had barely met Anderson before turning up on The Phantom Thread, yet “he acted as if I was an old college friend and he was so glad I was there and now we can do this. His leadership is implicit. The ideas are him. He never has to swagger around and act like he’s the boss.” I blather on about how I’ve always found him surprisingly approachable. Yes, she says, isn’t he fun? And sets are full of love and momentum. Then comes the kicker, a dry flash of Bebe Glazer: “But he could behave any way he wanted. I don’t think his repertoire is limited. I think he knows how to get the best out of people.” Be it opportunism or diplomacy, Anderson – the great auteur – seems increasingly eager to evolve into the ether. On set, he says, he wants to disappear as completely as possible (not beforehand, mind: for all its pinball plotting, the script for Licorice Pizza is the most exact he says he has written). Today, he loves reeling off examples of his own redundancy. When Haim binned an “over-wordy” scene in favour of just demanding someone tell her whether he’s circumcised. Anderson cackles. “That moment of joy when you’re not a writer any more, when you’ve set a table for someone and they are devouring the meal and running with it. There’s not a moment where I would say: Cooper, stop, you’re improvising too much. You hope to get to a place where anything you’ve written isn’t needed any more.” Another time, he wanted Alana to lose an argument for the sake of the narrative arc. “She was incapable of doing that. Take after take, I said: ‘I know it feels strange, but please, I really need you to do this.’ I’m the director, who’s in charge! She’d never done this before! I’m demanding she loses the fight. “She refused! And eventually I realised – you’re trying to impose this thing which is never going to happen. Clearly, I’m steering in the wrong direction. Whatever dream you had for your movie is gone. I was so proud. Don’t listen to my horseshit. It was kind of magical.”Carefully orchestrated passivity is Anderson’s genius, thinks Higgins. “Paul is really interested in observing things and reporting them back to us. For all his brilliance, there’s a matter-of-fact quality to his films: look at this and this, and now this. It’s kinda simple. There’s not a lot of ideas flying around. It’s what he sees. The audience is the one who is burdened by ideas.” Anderson has made instant stars of Hoffman and Haim. But – he’d presumably protest – only insofar as he simply noticed them. “I’ve cast actors to come on and say, ‘Would you like more coffee’ and they freeze up. There’s absolutely nothing that I can say to help them. Saying lines like you made them up is a skill that you either have or you don’t. “If you don’t believe me, try it one day. It’s really, really, really, really hard to say the simplest things in a natural way, particularly when there’s a camera and people around, and to do it time after time. It’s a very rare skill few people have. It would be incorrect to think I’m responsible beyond just creating a nice situation.” (Haim’s nice situation turns out to have been a two-month course in driving massive old lorries, in aid of one scene – and to stop her sitting at home and getting cold feet. “Stop worrying about the acting! Worry about guiding a 10-tonne truck backwards down a hill.”) Both Haim and Hoffman have been Golden Globe nominated, Anderson too. Oscars will follow. The gamble has paid off. But what if it hadn’t? Given the family ties, the personal history, their youth: how did Anderson handle such high stakes? “Delicately, compassionately, with an enormous amount of thought and protection. Just don’t treat it lightly.” He pauses. But also, do treat it lightly. “We take the work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves seriously and we want it to be simple and we want it to be fun.” Still, Anderson and Haim are the ones doing all the press, with Hoffman carefully protected. Haim – once his babysitter – proves as tough a bodyguard as her boss. “Me and Cooper are two peas in a pod,” she warns with a smile. “Us against the world. With Paul.” In the film, Harris’s character, finally getting the measure of this potential new client, tells Alana: “You remind me of a dog. Of an English pitbull dog, with sex appeal and a very Jewish nose.” Not brutal, just helpful, thinks Harris. “I know people who talk like that. One agent said to me: ‘How do you feel about my wrinkles?’ It’s somebody giving you a chance – are you aware? Have you thought of this?” Haim likes the idea that she is a beast to be unleashed. “I’m very territorial when it comes to the people that I love. I love very hard and if you’re in my family, I will do anything to protect you. Cooper is basically my family now. I would do anything for him. I can be very sweet, but you don’t want to mess with anyone that I love.” “That line is how I would describe Alana,” says Anderson. “And that is a compliment. I love pitbulls. I have had many of them. They are fantastic dogs and they have this reputation as being these killers but it’s not true at all. They are the most intelligent, loving, generous companions. And if they decide to kill you, they will kill you and they will not stop.” He has watched his own dog kill a smaller dog, he says; less fun than watching Haim “protect and snap”. “I want that person on my side because they are moving through this world and very generous and very alive and very welcoming, but with a very strong point of what is OK and what is not OK.” Punchy, ballsy, broad-shouldered despite her slightness, Haim seems a fitting woman to be Anderson’s first female lead (Licorice Pizza shares some DNA with Punch-Drunk Love, not least having Hoffman Senior as a mattress salesman, but Emily Watson was still second fiddle to Adam Sandler). What is strange is that Anderson himself, for a father of four who has specialised in movies about masculinity, seems so feminine. “That’s nice of you to say,” he says, gently. “I will tell that to my sisters. They will love that.” Yet his film is less simple when it comes to gender. The three sisters, for instance, are shown as fractious, needling, difficult. The boys, meanwhile – Gary, his nine-year-old brother and the troupe of friends they hang out with – are collaborative, loving and can-do. Is that generally the case? “Sometimes you love each other,” says Haim. “Sometimes you don’t. I grew up in a household with three girls sharing one bathroom.” In the film, all three are still living with their parents, “well past when they should be”, says Anderson (three sisters his age, four older brothers). “The boys are running free, free of supervision to roam the streets.” So perhaps it’s less about a gender divide than two types of parenting: one top-heavy, the other over-light (Gary’s father is unseen, his mother overworked and often absent). It’s not hard to decipher which product of these approaches is presented as better-adjusted. Is Gary a child of the 70s, Alana someone who could have been raised today? Yes, says Anderson. “Kids today have far less independence. Even if they have the illusion of independence, their parents are still tracking their movements on their telephone. There’s no mystery any more for these kids about where another person is or where their friends are.” “I think it’s a very accurate representation of that very romantic time. You could just go! Go ride your bike, go to the movies, go do something, get out of the house, go away! “I don’t think we’re doing kids any favours. I’m desperate to give my kids even more independence, but it’s not just up to me. I’m only 50% of that vote. I think most parents feel more comfortable to know just where their kids are at all times. It makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable, like big brother. I don’t need to know, especially if they are doing well and I trust them or they have to venture out and find trouble or find mischief. I want to encourage them …” To find mischief? “Of course. Sure. Hopefully the good kind.” Licorice Pizza luxuriates in a time of freedom and chaos and danger, even if that threat never quite materialises. “Paul’s movies are like that too,” says Higgins. “They don’t quite follow the screenplay rules. They are totally individual and parentless in themselves.” Yet some have accused the director of using that period setting to smuggle through stories that would be unacceptable today. Some feel the Japanese restaurant scenes leave a sour taste; plain anti-Asian, not smart satire. “It’s a period piece,” protests Higgins. “It’s nice to see how far we’ve come. I play a lot of characters who are less enlightened than I am. It’s a work of art, not of politics. When we start cherrypicking behaviours that were unacceptable then we’re starting to get into trouble.” Others have criticised the central romance as predatory, paedophilic even, on account of the age gap. So, did he set it 50 years ago to set some distance? Anderson hmms. Actually, he tried to talk himself out of setting another movie back then. The transfer of other elements jarred. Gary’s ambition, mostly. “He wouldn’t be selling water beds; would he be in advertising? Doing YouTube or reviews on TikTok? These things seemed unappealing to me and not very cinematic.” He pauses, question unanswered. “I’d have to think longer and harder. Does the 70s setting soften the blow? For sure, if you look back at something, it’s another time. Perhaps it places it just out of reach. But it would still be exactly the same dynamic, which is a classic device of any screwball comedy: two people bound to each other with an impossible obstacle.” Has he ever thought about what it would be like gender-flipped? “I don’t want to spend too much time thinking about that. What would the point be in that exercise? What would it look like? I wonder.” Less funny? “Probably. It’s nice to know what the parameters are in a relationship because then you can get on with the business of the story. You can get on with all the stuff that concerns you. All the sticky stuff.” Haim adds backup. No, it didn’t concern her. “We were very delicate with everything.” It’s hard to argue. The lust is all Gary’s; eyeing up Alana as she sleeps, livid she won’t show him her breasts. It’s a film of subtle leg brushes, fingers touching, sweetness and running. Sure, it’s the 70s, but it’s miles more Love Story than Deep Throat. “You see all these sort of pre-Hays Code films from the 30s,” says Anderson, “and they are meant to be so naughty. And they are touching a little bit closer to something, but they are still well-mannered because they know what’s right and what’s not.” Maybe one day he’ll work it out too. Maybe one day he’ll be old enough. So far, though, he sighs, not unhappily, ageing is “just swimming out to sea. You think you’re going to get to this other shore that will magically have all the answers. It turns out you’re just swimming further away from the shoreline and seeing it disappear behind you. And you wonder, wow! Pretty far out here. I’m pretty far out on life’s limb.” So how do you stay afloat? “Keep treading water! Look for somebody else to hold on to.” When did he last think he was drowning? “This morning! No. No, I’m not one who thinks he’s drowning. I’m more someone who thinks: enough with the water already.”  Licorice Pizza will be in UK cinemas on 1 January 2022",Arts/Film,‘Being in love is the most difficult challenge of your life’: Paul Thomas Anderson and Alana Haim on making Licorice Pizza,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/31/licorice-pizza-paul-thomas-anderson-alana-haim-cooper-hoffman
12/31/2021,"For the past two years, Australia has fought off waves of Covid using strict lockdowns and closed borders. The payoff has been counted in the fatality rate – Australia has had one of the lowest rates of death anywhere in the world.  Over the past week, that story has started to change. Now, cases of Omicron are exploding around the country with the national tally hitting over 21,000 cases on Thursday and New South Wales recording that alone on Friday. Here are four charts that show the extraordinary turnaround in case numbers: Within about a couple of weeks, Australia has gone from having one of the lowest rates of new Covid cases per population anywhere in the world to being in the top 20 of countries with a population over 500,000. By the same measure if NSW were a country it would be sitting in the top 10. While Australia’s cases have been climbing, so too have those of other countries. On Wednesday, the US set a global record with 488,000 cases according to the New York Times database. It’s important to note that countries with better testing systems are inherently likely to produce higher figures – and even in Australia’s case, it is clear that many positive cases are going unrecorded. Nevertheless, its position has changed extremely rapidly. Sydney has gone very quickly from containment to explosion. On 3 December Australia’s biggest city recorded its first known case of Omicron community transmission – a school student. Regional cities and rural areas have also experienced a sharp rise in cases. The NSW government initially held steady on the plan to lift its mask mandate and abandon QR codes just as the wave of cases broke – which quickly forced it to backtrack. This chart shows how quickly cases grew – with the seven-day rolling average now spiking vertically. Although NSW has led the nation’s outbreak, case numbers have grown in every state and territory, resulting in a huge rise in the national number. On Thursday the nation’s chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly sought to dampen Omicorn panic by pointing to the “positive” news – while cases are skyrocketing, hospitalisations have not seen a surge. “Hospitalisations, ICU and ventilation rates in Australia, they’re extremely low compared with what we were ­seeing with Delta and in the pre-vaccination era, with other variants of the virus,” Kelly said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning This data can be hard to track across the different jurisdictions, because of the lag in reporting times, but it is important to note there is a gap of 10 to 14 days between cases being recorded and hospitalisations. It is certainly true that the hospital numbers have not followed the skyrocketing case numbers. As the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, pointed out on Friday, some of those in hospital with Covid will have been admitted for other reasons, and it is hard to disentangle the data – but those cases nevertheless still add to complications for treatment and the burden on the health service.",News/Australia news,Australia’s Covid surge in four charts: NSW now has one of world’s highest infection rates ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2021/dec/31/australias-covid-surge-in-four-charts-nsw-now-has-one-of-worlds-highest-infection-rates
12/31/2021,"On 14 December I took my last shopping trip, stocked up, and went home. Apart from a few necessary work events and trips to (vaccinated and tested) friends’ houses, I’ve stayed at home ever since. Coming from a huge New Zealand family, Christmas for me is all about people. I love summer and swimming, and my partner is always surprised by just how much energy I have for socialising in our extrovert v introvert relationship. But when the New South Wales government opened up on the 15th, my world closed down. I have rheumatoid arthritis and a few other autoimmune diseases, so I am on medications that leave me immunocompromised. And the science was clear: with my vaccines completed in early August, I had considerably reduced protection from Omicron.  The last two years have been tough. At the start of 2020, I was living in a sharehouse in Sydney’s Newtown, working in theatre and film, and spending as much time as possible in the US with my partner. When Covid first broke, I wrote an opinion piece about my anger at society’s complacency around the deaths of those in the disability community. It still stings when Covid-related deaths are prefaced with a caveat about “underlying health conditions” – because that is what I have, and I love my life. Just after that article was written I moved out of my beloved share-home, put all my belongings, bar two suitcases, into storage, and moved back to Aotearoa for five months. I never did get to direct that show in Canada, my Sydney Film Festival debut was online, and I didn’t see my partner for more than a year. Lockdown sucks. I get it. But I’m alive. And that’s no small thing. Around 60% of the 148,000 people who died in the UK were part of the disability community. In the United States, where 1 in every 500 people have died, those with underlying health conditions were four times more likely to lose their lives. Living with an underlying health condition during the pandemic has been incredibly difficult. Despite government claims that people at risk would be prioritised for vaccination, my health providers didn’t know when or how I could get vaccinated, leaving me and many others to roam government websites searching for an appointment. I was eventually allocated to an inner-city hospital with a very low vaccine supply, and I wasn’t able to change this allocation. While I spent hours in vain calling the vaccine hotline begging for a new and earlier appointment anywhere in Sydney, friends my age without health conditions were able to book and get vaccinated before me. I am educated, articulate, mobile and can advocate for myself; it’s troubling to consider how others in the disability community navigated the system without these privileges. Eventually I travelled to Aotearoa again where common sense seemed to prevail: I was finally able to get vaccinated within a few weeks and stayed out of Sydney, my home, for another four months. Despite government promises, Australia moved out of lockdown before vaccine rates for many at-risk communities reached the levels set for the broader community, in what I think is a careless and avoidable decision. The way the Perrottet government has managed the transition from lockdown has been nothing short of bizarre. Ending mask mandates, capacity limits and QR registrations just as a new strain of Covid was hitting, vaccine immunity was waning, and boosters were yet to be rolled out was always going to be the disaster we are currently facing. At the same time, I’m so disappointed by the rhetoric of our state and federal leaders of “personal responsibility”. Wearing a mask is more than an individual protection. It is an act of solidarity and community care. It acknowledges that you have no idea who might be vulnerable around you and that you value the health of others. To not wear a mask is not an act of freedom; it is callous. Focusing on “personal responsibility” during a pandemic is an elitist and ableist luxury. It also doesn’t work. Beyond personal protection, vaccination availability and acceptance is about community protection. Vaccinations only work when they are available to everyone, creating herd immunity across the community. Furthermore, without financial support, most of us, including people with underlying conditions, need to leave our homes to work and live, even as it becomes increasingly difficult to get any Covid test, let alone one without out-of-pocket costs. Again, our politicians have let us down. More than 18 months after my previous article, I was asked as a woman with disability about how I am feeling about Covid and the end of lockdowns. But my lockdown has not ended; it will continue until there is a coherent plan from our leaders that doesn’t leave people with disability behind. I feel undervalued and forgotten. I feel that my life is seen as less important that those without disability. Ironically, we may well be creating a new generation of people with disability and illness – a new generation with underlying health conditions – through the impacts of long Covid. I hope we treat these people better in the future than we are treating people with disability today.

12/31/2021,"The lights are on late – and that means moths. Tonight, one is just resting on our kitchen window, looking somewhat forlorn, on the outside looking in, incidental and uninvited. These visitors this time of year are usually winter moths (Operophtera brumata). Tonight, when lights will be on in many places till the small hours, it would be easy to think that the moths are the ones missing the party, dressed in the dullest of grey-brown and having little to do but flutter about on gossamer-thin wings. But that would be quite wrong. Theirs is the best and wildest party of all. The air of winter dusk reeks of pheromones. The females are flightless, and on mild nights they climb trees and send out chemical messages that charge the atmosphere with possibility. It’s a lust-fest out there. The males hasten to the treetops to copulate. Sometimes in their zeal they fly off with their mate still attached. The flightless take a flight – what a way to start the year!  Assuming they return to the trees, the females lay their eggs in the bark and in spring the caterpillars hatch, with the intention of meeting the leaf-burst. In oak woods there is an arms race between tree and caterpillar. If the caterpillars hatch at just the right time, when the leaves are fresh and delicious, they might completely defoliate and damage the tree; if the oak brings leaves late, the larvae might all starve. But the caterpillars have an emergency plan for the latter; they let themselves down on silk threads and hope the breeze wafts them to better fare. There is another player in this drama, the blue tit. Blue tits in woods may rely on an abundance of winter moth caterpillars to feed their brood. For them, a good caterpillar crop is essential, so they need the larvae to prosper. A blue tit might meet a winter moth tomorrow. Blue tits are winter vegetarians; their guts are adapted so. They won’t eat the moth and won’t have any idea that this flying neighbour is the key to their breeding success in a few months’ time.
