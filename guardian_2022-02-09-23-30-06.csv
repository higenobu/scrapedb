2/9/2022,"The current western narrative on the Ukraine crisis is that Russia is a machiavellian power with an expansionist agenda. That view is shaping our response: we are matching Vladimir Putin’s aggression, meeting strength with strength and threats with threats. But what if we tried to get inside the mind of the enemy, and ask what was motivating the aggression? By doing so, could we break this cycle – and offer Putin a way out, too? When the USSR deployed ballistic missiles to Cuba in the 1960s, their proximity to the US nearly unleashed a third world war. Sitting in Moscow today, does Putin see being encircled by Nato as an equivalent threat? After all, one of his core demands is that Nato curbs its expansion close to the Russian border, and that Ukraine must not join. Russia claims that the US repeatedly told Soviet leaders it would incorporate Russia into a cooperative European security framework. In practice, Nato emerged as a US-dominated security frame with about 75,000 US troops still on European soil. Great powers always treat with suspicion and hostility the presence of rival great powers on their borders.  Putin was always bitter about the collapse of the Soviet Union. He bided his time, and in 2014 Russia seized Crimea and sent troops into Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region to support the separatist movement. Russia today is no benign liberal democracy and President Putin has an intelligence mindset, playing poker, not chess. He is prepared to threaten war, create chaos and spread misinformation to push back Nato from Russia’s borders. Using coercive diplomacy, he has amassed more than 130,000 troops on the eastern border of Ukraine, a continued threat to its sovereignty. Yet however provocative Russia’s behaviour, western governments have a responsibility not to escalate the threat of war. The consequences of a direct US-Russian confrontation in Ukraine would be catastrophic on all sides. A full-scale conventional war could escalate into nuclear war. Even a limited war would create a ruinous global economic crisis that could destroy for the foreseeable future any chance of serious action against climate change. I have worked in conflict resolution for the past 20 years and seen the dangers of stumbling into wars, unable to stop or turn back. Selling weapons to a country may look like a principled act in support of an ally but it usually takes them deeper and deeper into the quagmire of conflict. The US and the UK have instigated and been involved in four failed wars this century, but we seem to have failed to have learned the lessons. There are those who argue that sending military support to Ukraine strengthens Nato’s hand at the negotiating table. Yet there are inherent dangers in this approach – the use of deterrence could be the very thing that escalates the situation. Washington and London have pledged to increase offensive military aid to Ukraine and have announced arms deliveries, ammunition and anti-tank weapons. The UK is seeking to put itself at the forefront of western efforts to forestall what the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has called the risk of a “lightning war” in eastern Europe. Germany has been much more sceptical, blocking the transfer of German-made weapons from Baltic states to Ukraine. It has long argued against sending weapons to active conflict zones. Germany has declared that it is prepared to have a serious dialogue with Russia to defuse the highly dangerous situation, arguing that diplomacy is the only viable way. Whatever western governments feel about Moscow’s behaviour, de-escalating the conflict and giving Moscow a ladder to climb down is in everyone’s interest. We should not underestimate the link between humiliation and aggression. Putin is a very proud man, and smart politics by western governments should offer face-saving gestures if we are serious about avoiding war. According to Anatol Lieven, an academic and Ukraine specialist, this is “the most dangerous crisis in the world today; it is also in principle the most easily solved”. A solution exists, drawn up by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine in 2015, which involves the implementation of the Minsk II agreement. This offers demilitarisation, a restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty including control of the border with Russia, and full autonomy for the Donbas region. The main objection for Kyiv is that autonomy for the Donbas would prevent Ukraine from joining Nato and the EU. One way through this would be for Nato to declare Ukraine a neutral country and decree that it does not join Nato for at least a decade. In practice, Ukrainian membership of the EU is ruled out for at least a generation because of Ukraine’s corruption, political dysfunction and lack of economic progress. Talks between Putin and France’s President Macron this week were more conciliatory in tone. Macron said: “There is no security for Europeans if there is no security for Russia.” A permanent forum where Russia is welcome is needed to re-examine the post-cold war security system in Europe. This approach to issues such as missile deployments, arms control and transparency around military exercises could ease this conflict. Such a dialogue could create a climate of security cooperation with Russia.

2/9/2022,"The telecoms regulator has dropped its long-held belief that a merger between any of the UK’s big four mobile operators should be blocked at all costs, raising the possibility of a mega merger between Vodafone and Three UK. Ofcom previously maintained that such a reduction in competition would lead to higher-priced phones and bills for consumers and businesses.  Under the former chief executive Sharon White, Ofcom was an outspoken opponent of Three UK’s attempted £10.25bn takeover of O2, which was blocked by competition regulators six years ago. Ofcom said on Tuesday it has now “clarified its position on mobile consolidation”. Months before the deal was blocked, White, who is now the chair of the John Lewis Partnership, delivered a scathing speech attacking the deal, saying that a move from four to three main players would “shift the balance of power” in the market. “Competition is the lifeblood of today’s telecoms market, spurring innovation, better coverage and fair prices,” she said. “The deal could mean higher prices for consumers and businesses.” The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, to which Ofcom feeds market data and views on any takeover, and the European Commission both subsequently agreed that the deal should be blocked. Ofcom has previously explicitly stated in its annual plans that the UK market needs four leading mobile players to operate efficiently. On Wednesday, Ofcom softened its outright opposition to such a prospect in today’s market, saying: “Our stance on a potential merger would be informed by the specific circumstances of that particular merger, rather than just the number of competitors.” The shift in position will be welcomed by the Vodafone boss, Nick Read, who is under pressure to improve the company’s performance from the new activist investor Cevian. Read has been outspoken about the need for a change in the regulatory stance to allow mergers from four to three competitors, as has been seen in markets such as the US. Last week, he said that the European telecoms industry must consolidate to create more profitable businesses that are more attractive to investors. He confirmed the mobile operator was speaking to rivals in the Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, including Three. Shares in Vodafone hit a seven-month high in January after it emerged that the company had held talks late last year to buy Three UK from its parent, CK Hutchison, a takeover that would create a British mobile powerhouse with almost 30 million customers. Robert Finnegan, the chief executive of Three UK, said the UK mobile market needs consolidation as its infrastructure is “sub-par” compared with many other countries. “As things stand, the UK does not have the quality of mobile infrastructure it deserves,” he said. “Investment is spread too thinly across too many players, meaning our networks are sub-par by international standards.” Finnegan said consolidation in the industry could improve networks. “Moving from four to three mobile players in the UK would mean better, smarter investment in the networks which would, in turn, improve the quality and scale of connectivity in Britain and would unleash more competition,” he said. He added that ultimately this would mean customers and businesses would “benefit from more choice and better deals”. In 2020, the general court of the European Union annulled the commission’s decision to block the Three/O2 merger in 2016. The commission is awaiting the outcome of an appeal of the general court’s decision to the European court of justice. While Ofcom’s change in position may spark hope of a mega mobile merger, it is ultimately the Competition and Markets Authority that decides whether any deal among the UK’s main mobile operators should be approved or blocked.",News/Business,Ofcom softens opposition to mobile phone operator mergers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/ofcom-softens-opposition-to-mobile-phone-operator-mergers
2/9/2022,"The director of the Rijksmuseum said he was “happy” as Dutch prosecutors announced they would not proceed with an investigation into complaints over a newly opened exhibition on Indonesian independence, the first of its kind in Europe. The exhibition, Revolusi! Indonesia Independent, at the Netherlands’ national museum, has been a source a controversy since one of its curators, Bonnie Triyana, said the term “bersiap”, or stand by, would not be used in reference to the violent upheaval that followed a declaration of independence from the Dutch state.  Triyana claimed that use of the word, a battle cry for young Indonesians seeking independence, “takes on a strongly racist connotation” in the Netherlands today that “always portrays primitive, uncivilised Indonesians as perpetrators of the violence”. He said: “The team of curators has decided not to use the word bersiap as a common term referring to the violent period in Indonesia.” In a sign of the ongoing sensitivity in Dutch society over the country’s colonial history, the comments drew a furious response in some quarters, with the head of the federation of Dutch Indonesians, Hans Moll, accusing the Rijksmuseum of genocide denial by ignoring that “thousands of Dutch people were brutally tortured, raped and murdered by Indonesians because of their Dutch or European ethnicity”. Complaints were made to the general prosecutor last month but Taco Dibbits, the Rijksmuseum’s director, said he had learned on the eve of the exhibition’s opening on Thursday that the justice ministry would not be proceeding with the case. “I’m happy and had expected the decision that the case is not viable,” he said. “But I think it is very good that there is discussion about these concepts. It is our duty to broaden our view of history.” Dibbits said the exhibition did make reference to the term bersiap but put it in the context of violence endured by a large range of people, and that the show explored the entire period from 1945 to 27 December 1949 when the Dutch withdrew. He said: “The term ‘bersiap’ is used in the Netherlands by different communities that had to flee Indonesia and were repatriated during the revolution. It marks a very specific moment in time in the four and a half years of the revolution, the moment of the fall of 1945, when Indonesia has just declared itself independent and groups of insurgents executive extreme violence against several groups: Indo-Europeans, Moluccans on the Dutch side, and Chinese and others they thought were on the Dutch side. It takes place in the chaos just after the declaration of independence. “We explain the source of the word, which started to be used in the Netherlands in the 1980s, and give it a historical context, but also speak about the violence against other groups during the revolution. We speak about violence in a much broader sense.” Dibbits said he felt it was a “pity” that complaints had been made to the prosectors before the exhibition had opened. A second complaint, which is also not being pursued, was filed with prosecutors after Dibbits clarified ahead of the opening that the bersiap concept would be referenced. Dibbits said: “One claimed that not using the term was against history and the second complaint said the using of the term was against history.” Indonesia became a member of the United Nations in 1950 and today the country counts about 270 million inhabitants across more than 17,000 islands. The exhibition explores the personal stories of independence fighters, artists, diplomats, politicians, journalists and those seeking to maintain Dutch hold over the territory by displaying more than 200 objects, including privately owned keepsakes and paintings. Dibbits said among the most powerful artefacts was a bundle of baby clothes made out of book covers, belonging to a young woman called Julia Nelisse. She had given birth to a daughter, Merani, in a leper colony in Pelantungan, modern-day Java, on 6 September 1947. Corpses of fighters and civilians were regularly washing up on the river shore, which Neliise laid out on cloth shrouds. Due to the lack of remaining cloth, she had to take the covers from books in the abandoned colony library to make into clothes. On show is a vest, a pillow and a nappy. “It is very emotional to see and brings it very close,” Dibbits said.",News/World news,Dutch officials drop case against Rijksmuseum over ‘racist’ word,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/dutch-officials-drop-case-against-rijksmuseum-over-racist-word
2/9/2022,"There have been further increases in “sophisticated, high-impact ransomware incidents” coming from Russia and other former Soviet states during 2021, Britain, the US and Australia said in a joint review of cyber-extortion trends. Universities and schools were one of the top sectors targeted in the UK last year, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said, as well as businesses, charities, law firms, councils and the NHS. Hackers are increasingly offering services or exploits “for hire”.  Lindy Cameron, the chief executive of NCSC, said ransomware – where cybercriminals seize control of IT systems and demand payment to hand them back – was “a rising global threat” and called on organisations to review their defences. Hackers typically come from Russia or are Russian speakers, with the west accusing Moscow of turning a blind eye to cyber-attacks. The shutting down of the notorious REvil gang last month by Russia’s FSB spy agency is understood not to have had any impact on incident levels. KP Snacks, the maker of Hula Hoops and McCoy’s crisps, warned earlier this month that it was struggling to supply stores after a ransomware attack. It said supply disruption would last until “the end of March at the earliest”. In November, an attack on a supplier to the Labour party led to Labour losing access to some of its membership data. The supplier had refused to pay a ransom, leading to some data being permanently lost. No figures were put on the level of increase in attacks during 2021, although last October spy agency GCHQ said UK ransomware incidents had doubled. But the joint advisory did say hackers were diversifying because “the criminal business model of ransomware is now well established”. Some cybercriminals specialised in ransom negotiations; others sought to offer victims “a 24/7 help centre” to facilitate prompt extortion payments. Ransoms demanded vary by the size of the victim and the greed of the criminals, although figures of £1m or more are not unusual. It is not illegal in the UK for businesses to pay to regain access to their IT systems, and while there has been a debate in government about the issue, the situation is not expected to change. Criminalising British businesses who have been targeted by Russian hackers is not considered an attractive option. In the US, the FBI, NSA and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said they had seen a shift away from “big-game hunting” – the targeting of high-profile organisations – although this was not the case in the UK or Australia. Some of the American effect may be a response to complaints made by the president, Joe Biden, directly to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, after several high-profile attacks, and a growing US willingness to disrupt hacker activity. Last May, fuel supplies in the US south-east were disrupted after an attack on the energy supplier Colonial Pipeline; the company paid a ransom of $4.4m, although half was subsequently recovered the US authorities. Attackers gained entry by trying to lure people into clicking on malicious links in emails, brute force or exploiting software vulnerabilities, the joint warning said. Remote working in response to the pandemic meant such attacks would “likely remain popular”, the three countries’ cyber agencies added.",News/Technology,"Russian ransomware attacks increased during 2021, joint review finds",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/09/russian-ransomware-attacks-increased-during-2021-joint-review-finds
2/9/2022,"Russia and Belarus will begin 10 days of joint military drills on Thursday, setting in train one of the most overtly threatening elements of the Kremlin’s buildup of forces around Ukraine’s borders. Valery Gerasimov, the head of the Russian general staff, arrived in Belarus on Wednesday to oversee the drills.  Russia has moved up to 30,000 troops, two battalions of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems and numerous fighter jets into Belarus for joint training exercises with the Belarusian army. Satellite imagery shows much of the hardware has been moved to locations close to the border with Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, reportedly told France’s Emmanuel Macron earlier this week that the troops would leave Belarus when the exercises ended on 20 February. Even if that does happen, the drills show that Belarusian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, is a firm ally in Putin’s Ukraine policy. “Lukashenko will not be able to resist giving Belarusian territory for whatever purposes Russia needs it, whether it’s marching through, using Belarusian military facilities, airbases, maybe potentially even the air defence system,” said Artyom Shraibman, a Belarusian political analyst. From the border with Belarus, it is only about 130 miles (210km) down a highway to Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and the joint exercises add a new front to a potential Russian assault on Ukraine. There is also a threat from the south, where Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, and from the east, where Moscow has directed an insurgency against Kyiv’s authority and has massed troops close to the Russia-Ukraine border. When Russia first invaded Ukraine back in 2014, Lukashenko remained studiously neutral, despite the fact Belarus and Russia are theoretically part of one “Union State”. He refused to recognise annexed Crimea as Russian territory, and maintained warm relations with the then Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. Privately, he told Poroshenko he would not allow Belarusian territory to be used by Russia in any attack against Ukraine. When Volodymyr Zelenskiy was elected in 2019, Lukashenko again extended the hand of friendship. “You have never had any problems from the territory of Belarus and with Belarus, you will never have them. We will always be the most kind and reliable of your supporters and partners,” Lukashenko told Zelenskiy in October 2019. Then, in August 2020, huge protests erupted in Belarus when Lukashenko declared an overwhelming victory in a rigged presidential election. The protest movement came within a whisker of toppling his regime, but Lukashenko regained control with a crackdown. After staying silent for some days, the Kremlin eventually decided to back its troublesome ally, offering Lukashenko support and financial backing as most western countries imposed sanctions and refused to recognise the election results. “Russia is slowly trying to extract the price for that support, and we’re seeing Lukashenko do things that he’s always resisted before,” said Nigel Gould-Davies, a former British ambassador to Belarus and a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The announcement of the exercises, which came after Russia had already started massing troops close to the Ukrainian border, was a sign of Lukashenko’s willingness to support Moscow. In recent weeks, he has made several demonstrative statements to prove his loyalty is beyond doubt. “For the west, it’s important to drown the Russian-Ukrainian brotherhood in blood,” Lukashenko said two weeks ago, speaking in his annual address in front of an audience of thousands. “However much some people might not like it, we will return Ukraine into our Slavic fold.” In an interview this week with Vladimir Solovyov, a pro-Kremlin television presenter, Lukashenko went further, saying that if Ukraine launched an assault on Donbas, he would send Belarusian troops to fight alongside Russian troops to repulse the attack. “The Belarusian army will act in exactly the same way as the Russian army, it will be a joint response. Do you think we’re joking around on the southern border today?” he asked, referencing the joint training exercises. Lukashenko has also recently offered to host Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus. Shraibman said neither of these things were likely to happen, noting Lukashenko’s usual mode was to promise a lot and then attempt to extract concessions. “I think his deeds, actions will always be behind his promises. No matter what he promises to Putin it’s not a given that he will actually deliver,” he said. This was illustrated by a recent announcement in Moscow suggesting Belarus would send troops to aid Russian forces in Syria, which was quickly downplayed by Lukashenko. Still, the Belarusian leader’s room for manoeuvring has been severely curtailed and he appears to have little choice but to allow Russia’s military to use Belarusian territory how it pleases in the posturing against Ukraine. With backing from Moscow and control over the security forces and army, Lukashenko’s domestic position appears secure for now, even as his foreign policy is more and more dictated by Moscow. Most opposition figures have either been jailed or forced to flee the country. Later this month, he will hold a constitutional referendum, widely dismissed as illegitimate by western countries, that analysts say is meant to pave the way for him to step back from the presidency at some point but retain overall control. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who stood against Lukashenko in the rigged elections in 2020 and later fled to neighbouring Lithuania, has criticised the joint exercises and Lukashenko’s support for Moscow’s stance on Ukraine. “Belarusians aren’t a threat to Ukraine, the regime is,” she said last week, after holding a video conference with several Ukrainian MPs.",News/World news,Belarus military drills to begin as Russia ratchets up Ukraine tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/russia-belarus-start-army-drills-threatening-step-ukraine
2/9/2022,"Eighteen months ago, Tre Stead was in hospital; now she’s on Coronation Street. As Frank Turner’s tour manager, back then she was one of six people the Guardian spoke to about how the shutdown of the live music industry had affected their lives. But now, with Covid restrictions relaxed and gigs allowed to happen as if the pandemic doesn’t exist, have they all returned to work? Yes, but not necessarily in ways anyone expected. Live music is back and bigger than ever. Artists such as the Weeknd and Harry Styles, who were originally going to play arenas, have rebooked their tours for stadiums, while major names such as Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish are beginning their delayed runs. There’s more work than ever before. But some tours – including Frank Turner’s – have been postponed in recent weeks, and new Covid variants mean that live music remains a horribly uncertain industry. Aerosmith cancelled their summer European tour last week, citing “uncertainty around travel logistics and the continued presence of Covid restrictions”, and Doja Cat cancelled her Brit awards performance due to a member of her team contracting the virus.  Stead is once again tour managing for Turner, but when she’s not, she now works in TV. At the end of 2020 she was contacted by another tour manager, who was working with the trade union Bectu to help music production people move into TV work – specifically to work in newly compulsory Covid departments created to ensure TV production could go ahead in a Covid-safe manner. She got her first credit on Rules of the Game, and currently she’s working on Corrie. “Part of the reason I did a Covid supervisor course was that anything I learned would be massively relevant when I went back to touring, in terms of knowing how to keep a tour safe,” she says. “We did our own festival at the Roundhouse in London September 2021, at full capacity, and we did 15 weeks of weekend touring, with no breakout in our team. We went with a team of six to the US on a tour bus, and again not one case. Then I went to Vegas on holiday in December and caught Covid on the plane home.” Matt Cox, keyboards technician for the Chemical Brothers and many more acts, knows other crew who moved into Covid supervision for TV. He had his own project – offering tech instrument support to musicians – that kept him occupied until live music returned. His first show was with the Chemical Brothers at Latitude, in July 2021. “It was weird,” he says, “because I’d been so dialled in to masks and sanitising – you can’t work if you’ve got Covid. And seeing 40,000 people without masks was weird.” The strangeness of the new world of touring is something everyone dwells on. “The album launch tour was very different,” says the Vaccines’ tour manager, Edd Sedgwick. “We did a lot of in-stores, and normally that means a lot of hugging. This time it meant the fans being two metres away from the band, and security guards wearing gloves passing the albums. I had a strict policy of no guests in the dressing room, no one going out to clubs and bars. We could have dinner together, but you couldn’t go to see your mate when we were in Birmingham. I might have been resented, but everyone wanted to get the job done and not have shows cancelled.” But going out on tour on the basis that you work the show and spend the rest of the time staying safe has rather reduced the level of enjoyment. “For some tours, there’s a more corporate feel to it now, with so many rules and regulations,” Cox says. “It’s taken some of the gloss off it, made it a bit more nine to five.” “It’s not as much fun as it was,” says Ben Bowers, a guitar tech for the hard rock band Rival Sons. “If you spend your time touring, you sacrifice a lot of your friendships at home. Your friendships are all over the world, and the road is your social lifeline. But it was like going to an office job where you have to stay in the office at the end of the night. It was really mentally challenging.” Harder for Bowers, in fact, than when there was no work, when he spent much of his time chasing the surf around the British coastline with his girlfriend in his old van. And even with protocols in place, disaster could still strike. Rival Sons went on a US tour during September and October, and then their drummer tested positive hours before a show. “We don’t get paid without a show, but I’m a drummer myself and I ended up stepping in and picking up the tour, so we were getting away with it. But then the rest of the band started falling down – we lost the bass player, then the singer, and we had to cancel 10 dates and quarantine.” That meant no money coming in, and lots going out – a financial disaster. And when the tour resumed, the crew started coming down with Covid: only Bowers and one other escaped, and he’s sure that’s because they had antibodies from infections before the tour began. There are those who are grateful for the chance to tour even with strict protocols. When we spoke in summer 2020, Tiffany Hendren was facing the prospect of having to spend the foreseeable future shut away at home in St Louis, Missouri – she is prone to respiratory infections and was at higher risk from Covid. She only returned to touring as a sound engineer in September because she had no choice: she was out of money. “That was a little terrifying. Even though if you are careful you are probably pretty safe, it just takes one afternoon in a coffee shop to get sick.” She loves her job so much that she’s happy to swap the normal touring routines for just going venue-to-bus, but safety is paramount. When she’s not touring, she runs the sound for a group of St Louis venues, which had reopened for business when the city lifted its mask mandate. “Cases went back up, and I almost cried when I realised people weren’t going to wear masks. And when we went back to full-capacity shows, that really freaked me out. Some shows everyone is doing the right thing and wearing masks, but country or hard rock bands you look out and see no masks.” Right now, the life of the crew member is more unpredictable than ever. Fears that they would see a drop-off in earnings because of low consumer confidence have been unfounded. “I’m earning the same, if not a bit more,” says Chris Yeomans, who has returned to work as a lightning engineer for McFly, among others. “Every artist wanted to tour again as soon as the gates were open, and there weren’t enough people to cover the number of tours. You might get four offers in a week, but you could only accept one of them.” The problem is the uncertainty: the peak of Delta and the rise of Omicron late last year prompted a rash of pre-emptive tour cancellations, and no one is ever sure shows will happen until they actually do – which means work can be there, and then disappear. On the other hand, though, there are always replacement slots on crews available when someone else has to pull out, owing to Covid. And, as Stead points out, the uncertainty is causing problems for everyone in the live music chain, from bus companies to booking agents. “At the Roundhouse we had a struggle to source lights, because everyone wanted everything at the same time,” she says. Stead isn’t unique when she surveys the future of crew work. “Working in TV made me realise how much I love music, but we all need a plan B now. My job as a tour manager is to plan for all eventualities. To not do that in my own life would be a bit silly.”",Arts/Music,‘We all need a plan B now’: the dicey world of live music after Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/09/we-all-need-a-plan-b-now-live-music-after-covid

2/9/2022,"Whisper it quietly, but for the first time in a good few years there is genuine optimism in rugby league ahead of what could be a seminal year for Super League. Few sports suffered quite like league did throughout the early stages of the pandemic, a point underlined by the publication of club accounts over the winter that showed monumental losses running into the millions for some of the biggest clubs.But, cautiously, that period appears to be behind us and Super League 2022 provides a chance to lay a positive platform for this year’s rescheduled World Cup. There are no shortage of stories to pick through too, with numerous clubs embarking on a new era, the opportunity for the competition to be shown on free-to-air television for the first time and the arrival of a second French club. Make no mistake, Toulouse Olympique face an uphill challenge to extend their stay in Super League beyond one season. They have been engulfed by Covid-related issues over the winter, culminating in the departure of their captain and talisman, Johnathon Ford. However, Sylvain Houles’ team will add colour and more continental vibrancy to the competition alongside fellow French side Catalans, and the prospect of a first all-French derby this summer is one to savour.  Before that though, there is another line-in-the-sand moment for Super League. Sky Sports have been loyal and lucrative partners for the competition since its inception in 1996, but there is little doubting that the platform Channel 4’s new broadcast deal provides has the opportunity to open previously unthinkable doors. Their arrangement to cover 10 games a season begins this weekend, when Leeds host Warrington in a fascinating clash between title contenders.It can only be good for rugby league that multiple broadcasters want to show domestic action, be it the BBC’s long-standing coverage of the Challenge Cup or Channel 4 muscling in on Super League. With the comedian Adam Hills leading the coverage on the commercial broadcaster, there is also an opportunity for huge crossover and for new supporters to be exposed to what Super League can offer in terms of entertainment. That, in turn, increases the pressure on the stars of the competition to deliver. Warrington’s trip to Headingley on Saturday is the first match of a new era for the club after turning to Daryl Powell to try and end the Wolves’ 66-year wait for a league title. Powell, previously the coach of Castleford for nine seasons, will bring his attractive brand of rugby to a club desperate for success – but they are one of several sides who face a battle to clamber past last season’s leading lights. It is somewhat ominous for the likes of Leeds, Warrington and Wigan – who also have a new coach in Matty Peet, a former junior player who has worked his way through the coaching ranks – that both reigning champions St Helens and last season’s beaten finalists Catalans appear to have become even stronger. The Dragons have brought in State of Origin superstar Mitchell Pearce and retained the majority of the squad that took them to a maiden Grand Final last year.St Helens have undergone an overhaul of the squad that delivered three consecutive titles, with the likes of Lachlan Coote, Theo Fages and James Bentley all departing. It is to their credit they have replaced two of those with homegrown talents, including Jack Welsby, who will make a compelling case for inclusion in England’s World Cup squad as he succeeds Coote at full-back following his departure to Hull Kingston Rovers. The strength of the top two makes the rest of the chasing pack’s job difficult – and the challenge for those who stuttered throughout 2021 even more arduous. That does not mean there is a shortage of subplots, however. For instance, how will the two Hull clubs fare after contrasting seasons last year? FC badly underperformed and limped their way to the finish, while Rovers defied expectations to finish in the play-off places and look to have strengthened again.At the bottom, Toulouse start as favourites to go down, but if they can make their Stade Ernest Wallon home a fortress, they stand a chance of survival. Expect the likes of Wakefield Trinity and Salford Red Devils to be their realistic relegation rivals. And all of that is before you bring the intrigue of the World Cup into play. If England can fulfil expectations in October and November, and Super League’s move to terrestrial television is a hit, we could be looking at a very different sport this time next year. Sit back and enjoy the ride. It’s bound to be thrilling.",Sport/Sport,"Toulouse, TV deal and a World Cup to follow: Super League 2022 is here",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/09/toulouse-tv-deal-and-a-world-cup-to-follow-super-league-2022-is-here-rugby
