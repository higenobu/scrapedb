12/26/2021,"With hundreds of thousands of Britons forced to self-isolate on Christmas Day, the spectre of Covid still hung over many people’s celebrations. But, thanks to social media, people were able to share their festivities, posting pictures of their drinks, decorations and, of course, their pets.  The hashtag #JoinIn was trending on Twitter on Saturday, allowing users to admire each other’s makeshift Christmas dinners and solo celebrations. The initiative was driven by comedian Sarah Millican, who urged followers not to “leave people hanging” if they were looking for companionship. Don’t forget to always include #JoinIn in your tweets so we can see you. And make sure you click on the hashtag and chat to whoever is there. Don’t leave people hanging who have reached out. ❤️❤️❤️ People responded in the spirit of Christmas, sharing photos and videos – whether they were alone or with friends and family. Twitter users also made themselves available for a chat, just in case an unlucky person started to feel adrift in self-isolation. Breakfast shares included Christmas tree-shaped crumpets and various forms of sandwiches while others opted for biscuits, teacakes or early Christmas pudding. This was my breakfast 👅 Merry Christmas everyone 🎄❤️ pic.twitter.com/Y47NThzoj3 Others took the discussion away from food, posting up pictures of their pets dressed in Christmas clothing, wreaking gift-wrapping havoc, and their own forms of entertainment. George, a cat at Stourbridge Junction station in the West Midlands, had his whole day at the station documented, from early morning moments by the Christmas tree through to the post-lunch washing up. “I am very lucky to have so many people who are kind to me. I know that this time of year can be difficult for many. Please don’t feel alone,” the account tweeted, sharing the community spirit everyone using the hashtag was trying to amplify. Our cat likes to sit in bags & get carried about on Christmas. If anyone needs a smile today 🤣#JoinIn #CatsOnTwitter pic.twitter.com/4T0nhEIC20 The conversations sought under Millican’s included offers of jokes and singing, simple conversations about how people were spending their day and empathic exchanges about precious moments missed during the past year. Beside the entertainment, some shared how difficult Christmas could be because of loneliness or longing for relatives they had lost in the past year and received outpourings of sympathy. Twitter user Jo Griffiths tweeted: “I was feeling a bit low this morning but I’m a bit more festive now so I thought I’d say hi to the #JoinIn community. You’ve all kept me company for at least three Christmases now and I wish you all the most wonderful day.” Samaritans, which reminded that its hotline is open for anyone wanting to talk, also tweeted advice on calming breathing exercises for anyone struggling with stress or anxiety.",News/Media,‘Please don’t feel alone’: People self-isolating connect on social media,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/25/please-dont-feel-alone-people-self-isolating-connect-on-social-media
12/26/2021,"Just over a year ago, Anna-Jane Casey was forced to abandon the Covid-shuttered West End to deliver hundreds of parcels in a second-hand van. She was overjoyed to find herself back on stage this Christmas in one of theatreland’s most star-studded and critically acclaimed shows: Cabaret. But productions are at the mercy of Omicron, with the highly transmissible Covid variant ripping holes in casts and backstage staff daily, so Casey’s triumphant return to the West End has been put on hold.  “Cabaret had to come off [last week] because there are about four to five cast members ill,” she said from her home in Kent. “It’s hit so many different departments: the dressers in the wardrobe department … our automation and sound and lighting. We’ve got a lot of cases across the board – and we’re a new production so the understudies aren’t ready to step in yet.” Cabaret – which stars Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley in a revival of the 1960s musical about the Nazi-menaced nightlife of the Weimar republic – is not the only theatrical casualty of the wave of infections sweeping the capital. Last week more than 70 performances of 31 shows were axed, including Moulin Rouge, Mamma Mia! and Matilda. “Up until about four days ago, 2021 was rocking along just fine. But we seem to be back where we were last year,” said Casey, who has appeared in shows including Chicago and Billy Elliot. “Producers are losing money hand over fist. Our producers are being unbelievably generous and paying us while we are not working but I don’t know how long that will last.” One of the few unscathed West End shows is Pride & Prejudice* (*sort of). But the play’s producer, David Pugh, fears for the theatre industry because the costs of daily testing and recruiting backup staff are mounting while audiences are staying away. Last week, the production lost £22,000. “Our running costs are increasing but our audiences are dipping. We’ve sold out but we are playing to about 35% of our audience,” said Pugh, who has won two Tony awards in the US and four Olivier awards in the UK. “We are all running out of money. Our box offices don’t reflect our increased costs. That is terrifying.” It costs £62,000 a week to stage Pride & Prejudice, including salaries and theatre rental. “With the additional staffing and all the extra PCR testing, it has gone up to over £65,000 a week. Audiences are rightly expected not to mix in groups. But we have to keep going because there is no insurance.” The government-backed insurance scheme for live entertainment only covers shows closed by lockdowns – it does not pay out if actors or production staff catch Covid. Only a few dozen, mostly commercial conference companies, are thought to have used the scheme. “We all looked at it and went ‘no’ – there is nobody [in the theatre sector] using it,” said Pugh. Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week announced a £30m top-up to the culture recovery fund to support museums, cinemas, and theatres to cope with the impact of Omicron. “We really welcome it. But when you divide it up by the many, many people that have suffered, I’m not sure whether it’s going to be enough to stop some companies going into liquidation,” said Pugh. “When this happened before, there weren’t as many shows on. There must be 100 to 150 pantomimes in the country and they have every right to apply to the scheme.” The uncertainty is taking its toll, after the prime minister refused to spell out new restrictions for England before Christmas – unlike the Welsh and Scottish governments. Casey said no one involved in live entertainment could plan for the future. “It is unbelievably stressful,” she said. “There’s a lot of anxiety for people who work in any kind of live entertainment at the moment.” Casey, who plays the tragic but chilling nightclub dancer, Fraulein Kost, in Cabaret, is desperate not to go back to delivering parcels, which she and her husband were forced to do last year to pay their mortgage and provide for their children. “We did about eight months of deliveries from the start of the summer to December,” she says. “I hope I never have to do that again. Not because I am workshy. But it was quite a toll on myself and my husband’s mental health. It was quite disheartening. It was not what we trained to do and love to do.” The stakes are high for an industry that adds billions to the British economy. Arts and culture contributed £10.47bn to the UK economy in 2019, employing 226,000 people. “New productions will not be developed if the risk is all on the producers,” said Casey. “We’re getting to the point where an industry that we’ve had for hundreds of years and is world-leading is going to be thrown away because we don’t have a workable insurance policy.”",News/World news,Life is a cabaret – until Covid brings down the curtain on the West End,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/25/life-is-a-cabaret-until-covid-brings-down-the-curtain-on-the-west-end
12/26/2021,"In the first of his four (stunning) Reith lectures on living with artificial intelligence, Prof Stuart Russell, of the University of California at Berkeley, began with an excerpt from a paper written by Alan Turing in 1950. Its title was Computing Machinery and Intelligence and in it Turing introduced many of the core ideas of what became the academic discipline of artificial intelligence (AI), including the sensation du jour of our own time, so-called machine learning. From this amazing text, Russell pulled one dramatic quote: “Once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control.” This thought was more forcefully articulated by IJ Good, one of Turing’s colleagues at Bletchley Park: “The first ultra-intelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.”  Russell was an inspired choice to lecture on AI, because he is simultaneously a world leader in the field (co-author, with Peter Norvig, of its canonical textbook, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, for example) and someone who believes that the current approach to building “intelligent” machines is profoundly dangerous. This is because he regards the field’s prevailing concept of intelligence – the extent that actions can be expected to achieve given objectives – as fatally flawed. AI researchers build machines, give them certain specific objectives and judge them to be more or less intelligent by their success in achieving those objectives. This is probably OK in the laboratory. But, says Russell, “when we start moving out of the lab and into the real world, we find that we are unable to specify these objectives completely and correctly. In fact, defining the other objectives of self-driving cars, such as how to balance speed, passenger safety, sheep safety, legality, comfort, politeness, has turned out to be extraordinarily difficult.” That’s putting it politely, but it doesn’t seem to bother the giant tech corporations that are driving the development of increasingly capable, remorseless, single-minded machines and their ubiquitous installation at critical points in human society. This is the dystopian nightmare that Russell fears if his discipline continues on its current path and succeeds in creating super-intelligent machines. It’s the scenario implicit in the philosopher Nick Bostrom’s “paperclip apocalypse” thought-experiment and entertainingly simulated in the Universal Paperclips computer game. It is also, of course, heartily derided as implausible and alarmist by both the tech industry and AI researchers. One expert in the field famously joked that he worried about super-intelligent machines in the same way that he fretted about overpopulation on Mars. But for anyone who thinks that living in a world dominated by super-intelligent machines is a “not in my lifetime” prospect, here’s a salutary thought: we already live in such a world! The AIs in question are called corporations. They are definitely super-intelligent, in that the collective IQ of the humans they employ dwarfs that of ordinary people and, indeed, often of governments. They have immense wealth and resources. Their lifespans greatly exceed that of mere humans. And they exist to achieve one overriding objective: to increase and thereby maximise shareholder value. In order to achieve that they will relentlessly do whatever it takes, regardless of ethical considerations, collateral damage to society, democracy or the planet. One such super-intelligent machine is called Facebook. And here to illustrate that last point is an unambiguous statement of its overriding objective written by one of its most senior executives, Andrew Bosworth, on 18 June 2016: “We connect people. Period. That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we have to do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.” As William Gibson famously observed, the future’s already here – it’s just not evenly distributed.

12/26/2021,"Nestled in the peaceful Lower Engadine valley in Switzerland, surrounded by spruce-covered mountains and their snow-dusted peaks, Laura Poretti’s Alpine chalet is something of a refuge. The Italian fashion-industry stalwart, who spent much of her childhood in the area with her grandfather, bought the place 14 years ago to counter the chaos of life in her native Milan, a two-and-a-half-hour drive away. “When I got married, my husband and I decided to have a different space, just for us. That’s why we decided to come here, because it’s far from people and the sun stays [out for] longer,” she laughs. “I have a very stressful life in Milano so when I come here it’s a place to relax.”  Poretti is the creative director of concept store Milaura, which she founded in 2015 (a Dover Street Market meets Liberty-style boutique, stocking more than 250 brands, from Victoria Beckham to Birkenstock). Just before the pandemic, she embarked on an ambitious but unfortunately timed expansion in Milan’s trendy Brera area, and has spent much of the past two years getting her baby – successfully – back on track. Needless to say, weekend escapes to the mountains are well deserved and hard won. Each Friday, Poretti and her family pack up the car and head north. While her three daughters, aged 13, 11 and nine, swoosh off to ski school on a Saturday morning, the couple meet friends for lunches, go for walks or unwind at home. Unlike a lot of the surrounding homes, the three-bedroom space is modest. “The nicest thing about my house for me is that it’s simple and chic, which is the best combination,” she says. “Here in Engadina you can find outstanding, sophisticated chalets, but for me, that’s too much.” In the chalet, this translates to cosy with a side of cute. Traditional embroidered tablecloths and contemporary Tupperware she picked up locally sit alongside cushions and cashmere throws, ready to cuddle up with under the comforting eye of ancestral portraits. Elsewhere, pieces she has designed herself mingle with contemporary furniture, making the Swiss retreat an extension of her inviting Corso Garibaldi flagship, where Poretti also curates items she has bought with pieces she has conceived. Poretti points proudly to gingham bed linen she has designed and curtains she had made by craftswomen in the Italian Tyrolean region of Trentino-Alto Adige. “I designed this pattern of embroidery and I went to a very, very little place called Casere, near Austria, where all the old women specialise in a very specific technique called ricamo tombolo,” she says. “I wanted to have 20m of it made [for the windows] and it took these ladies three months to embroider that much!” Poretti is passionate about every inch of the haven she has created: “I love the details,” she says. One such example is the Milaura doll that pops up on everything from textiles to tea sets. She designed the figure after a cancer diagnosis in 2015, and the doll became an emblem of the battle she faced when diagnosed. Now the logo of her brand, it serves as a reminder of the struggle she overcame. “I’m always grateful for that experience, because if I had never had cancer, I would never have done Milaura – I wouldn’t have had the courage to do something like that,” she says. “I have been a manager in big companies, but to do your own thing is a completely different job. I love my job, I work really hard. My dream is not just to have a store, but to find and build a huge company.” After spending years “shopping with other people’s money” as she puts it, Poretti has “a very clear idea of what I like and don’t like”. The same confident assertion is extended to her interior. “I don’t like when houses are messy, I love to have everything nice and I hate branded things,” she says. “For me, being very elegant means to be unique and different, that’s why in my concept store I don’t just have well-known brands – and the same goes for my home.” While work takes Poretti and her family back to Milan each Monday, the Engadine haven gives her the balance she needs. “I used to travel all over the world with the collections,” she says. “Now I just love the idea of feeling comfortable here.” Milaura, Corso Garibaldi, 20, 20121 Milan",Lifestyle/Life and style,Chalet chic: my Alpine escape,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/25/traditional-crafts-and-contemporary-design-in-a-swiss-alpine-chalet
12/26/2021,"When construction began to great fanfare in 2019, the Linglong car tyre factory outside of Belgrade was heralded as the jewel in the crown of Serbia’s burgeoning strategic partnership with China. Two years later, 500 Vietnamese construction workers were allegedly found last month working in conditions of forced labour with their passports confiscated and living in cramped and degrading conditions.  The case has shocked Serbians with the European parliament demanding answers as to how a major case of human trafficking could have apparently been allowed to fester in the heart of Europe. Yet Linglong factory was only the first stop in a much longer journey towards the UK and Europe for many of the workers found at the factory. An Observer investigation has found that Serbia and Romania are being used as new gateways to Europe for smuggling and trafficking gangs who are using guest worker visa programmes to transport large numbers of Vietnamese workers into eastern Europe. There they are often exploited in factories and construction sites before some are transported across land borders into the EU and, eventually, to the UK. At all stages along the way, Vietnamese workers are highly likely to fall into forced labour or debt bondage, often charged up to £30,000 for passage to the UK. In 2019, the death of 39 Vietnamese migrants in a lorry container highlighted the dangers that many face when attempting to reach the UK. Those who do arrive safely are often forced to pay off their debts in nail bars, restaurants and cannabis farms, with Vietnamese people one of the largest groups of modern slavery victims in the UK year after year. Nusrat Uddin, a trafficking specialist from Wilson Solicitors LLP, regularly acts for victims of trafficking and modern slavery in the UK. She said that many of her recent clients started their journey by flying on work visas into Serbia or Romania: “Almost all [our clients were] promised decent work with fair wages, but the reality is far from that. Many then travel onwards through Europe, again under the false premise of better conditions elsewhere.” According to interviews with Vietnamese workers, the Vietnam to Serbia migration route began operating in the summer with more than 500 workers flying on guest worker visas from August-October. Each worker was charged around £1,700, generating at least £850,000 in revenue for recruitment agencies arranging visas, jobs and travel. Tuan* travelled from Vietnam to Serbia on a guest worker visa after seeing an ad on Facebook promising well-paid work in a German-owned tyre factory. He ended up at Linglong. “When I arrived I found that the factory was basically buying Vietnamese workers and when you got there you had to do whatever they told you to do,” he said. They took his passport and told him his salary was half that promised. He says he was forced to sleep 50 to a room. “Many of us got Covid … and we didn’t even get any medicine,” he added. “The water was very bad, it was yellow and undrinkable and sour. The food was also very bad and not enough, sometimes we would go into the forest and hunt for food, anything we could catch, like rabbits.” Tuan says that out of those he was working alongside at the Linglong factory, 30 have already left Serbia for the UK, France and Germany, and many more were planning to go. He says since the tragedy of the lorry container deaths, new smuggling routes via Serbia and other eastern European countries had become increasingly popular. “For people who want to go to the UK, going to Serbia first is cheap. It only costs 50m VND (£1,626) for the visa, whereas the people who died in the lorry had to go many months on a dangerous route. So this choice is an easy one.” The Observer’s investigation found that workers who continued on to the EU and UK from the Balkans could take several routes, with smuggling networks taking Vietnamese people across the border into Romania and then on to Slovakia, Germany and France. They then waited in a makeshift camp for the chance to take an inflatable raft to the UK. Mimi Vu, an anti-trafficking expert living in Vietnam, has spent the past months researching the links between bilateral visa schemes in eastern Europe and the exploitation of Vietnamese migrant workers. “A key selling point to the Serbia route is that, like Romania, you can migrate legally through the reciprocal visa arrangements and it only costs a few thousand pounds, which is seen as a great bargain compared to the more traditional routes of going through Moscow or one of the central EU countries such as Poland or the Czech Republic into Europe, which can cost up to £30,000,” she said. “In the case of the Linglong factory, people were either coming because they were promised work in a German-owned factory or as a new Balkans gateway to the UK and Europe.” Vu says that the exploitation that workers like Tuan face when they arrive in countries such as Serbia and Romania also provides a huge incentive for workers to try to move into Europe and the UK in search of better paid work. Debt is also a major driver for people to try to move. The Observer has seen paperwork, called “Commitment not to escape forms” from Vietnamese recruitment agencies arranging guest worker visas for Serbia where workers must sign an agreement that their families must pay more than a year’s salary within a week if workers leave jobs. “Most people who leave Vietnam have family who have raised money for them to leave and they feel they can’t go back without paying off their debts,” said Vu. “So if they’re not earning what they’ve been promised in Serbia then the promise of higher paid work elsewhere is a huge incentive to leave.” Tuan says many of the Vietnamese he had been working with at Linglong had to raise thousands to pay for their passage into Europe. “Some who had been working at the factory with me had arranged to go to the UK before they arrived in Serbia,” he said. “I think they have to pay [smuggling gangs] around £6,000 to get them there from Romania. The smugglers would call family members in Vietnam to arrange to get the money so they could continue with their journey.” While Serbia is believed to be a new landing post used by criminal gangs, Romania, which signed a bilateral visa agreement with Vietnam in an effort to fill a huge manual labour shortage in 2018, is already established as a point of entry into Europe. Many also find themselves trapped in exploitative and dangerous work when they arrive there. Manh*, arrived in Romania with 60 other workers from Vietnam in 2019 to work for a major construction firm. By the end of his contract in 2021, half had crossed the border towards the UK and Europe. “Many ran away just one or two months after arrival,” he said. Manh’s brother, who worked for a different company in Romania, was among the many who left the country. “The pay in Romania was too low,” he said. Manh says he is now trapped in Romania. His contract expired in March and his employer has refused to extend it, leaving him working without a valid residence permit and unable to afford his flight home. When asked if he had any plans to leave Romania to search for work, he replied: “It’s a secret.” Over the past five years at least 231 Vietnamese people were intercepted trying to cross into Europe according to data from the Romanian border police. Hungarian police intercepted another 101 in the same period. Experts like Vu estimate this is only a very small portion of Vietnamese who leave Romania into western Europe. “​​As a new modus operandi, Vietnamese citizens enter Romania legally, based on work visas, and are subsequently detected on their way out of the country, trying to illegally cross the border,” a spokesperson from the Romanian border police told the Observer. Social media plays a central role for smuggling gangs. Facebook groups visited by the Observer offer “VIP” routes in private cars out of Romania. Packages are advertised with the dialling codes of the destination countries, with buyers able to pick the “44” package for the UK, “49” for Germany and “33 for France”. Prices fell during the pandemic, but a trip to the UK can still cost over £10,000. The reality of these VIP trips is harsh. Vietnamese migrants caught trying to leave Romania illegally by the country’s border police have been found hiding behind boxes of fruit or packed in minivans with “fake walls”. In the past year, people smuggling of Vietnamese migrants out of Romania has continued despite border restrictions caused by the pandemic. Trung, 36, now lives in Germany undocumented after having worked legally in Romania, taking the journey in the midst of a locked-down Europe in October 2020. Trung wanted to stay in Romania, but his employer refused to update the paperwork that would have let him remain legally in the country. He says he was faced with a choice of paying for forged paperwork or taking the risky journey to Germany. “The pay in Romania is only slightly higher than in Vietnam,” said Trung, whose Romanian employer paid him US$750 per month. Trung knew the dangers of travelling west, but he went anyway. “I believe in fate. Deciding to go is like a game of cards: chances of success are 50-50.” Yet for those trying to reach the UK, the perils are greater than those destined for France or Germany. Regardless of whatever VIP package they might have purchased to ensure safe passage, all must attempt the Channel crossing on flimsy rubber boats. “Historically, Vietnamese smugglers have had their own networks helping them get people to the UK in the back of lorries, but after Brexit and the resulting driver shortages and the 2019 container deaths they have had to pivot to using boat crossings that are controlled by non-Vietnamese smugglers,” says Vu. “In interviews I’ve conducted with Vietnamese who have made it to the camps in Dunkirk or across the Channel to the UK, all have said that crossing by boat is the only option.” She says that smugglers are telling Vietnamese in the makeshift camps in Dunkirk to stay apart and are then deliberately limiting the number of Vietnamese they are sending per boat so that they would be less visible among other ethnic groups. Last week, it was revealed that one of the 27 people who drowned while attempting the crossing last month was Vietnamese. Media reports named him as Le Van Hau, from the Nghe An province in Vietnam, who reportedly paid around £10,000 to find legal work in Poland before leaving immediately for France to attempt the Channel crossing. Once in the UK, and with thousands of pounds of debt, Vietnamese people become one of the most vulnerable groups to be trafficked into forced labour, debt bondage and sexual exploitation. Official Home Office figures show that Vietnamese were the third largest national group to be identified as victims of modern slavery. There were 653 Vietnamese people confirmed as victims of slavery in 2020, with the majority discovered in cannabis farms and nail bars. Last month, in a freezing migrant camp in Dunkirk, two young Vietnamese men huddled together for warmth, one of a group of around 20 or 30 scattered among hundreds of others refugees in the wasteland of tents. They said they left their home in Vietnam because of flooding, and borrowed money from loan sharks for their visa to Serbia in order to travel to the UK to find work in nail bars. When they got to the UK, they would owe an additional £18,000. “It has taken us two months to get here but finally the end is in sight,” said one, breaking off from a FaceTime call with his wife and small child in Vietnam. “I don’t know when I’ll get to go home, I can’t return empty-handed.” * Names have been changed",News/Global development,Revealed: the secret ‘forced labour’ migration route from Vietnam to the UK,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/25/revealed-the-secret-forced-labour-migration-route-from-vietnam-to-the-uk
12/26/2021,"Lawyers are calling for stronger warnings on breast implants as government figures show at least 88 women in the UK have been diagnosed with cancer linked to the surgery. A small number of women who have implants can develop a rare type of lymphoma known as Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL).  Several types of the implants most commonly associated with the disease – known as textured implants – are banned in France and Australia. The US Food and Drug Administration issued “black box” warnings – its most stringent warnings for drugs and medical devices – in October for breast implants, including their association with BIA-ALCL. There have been 733 cases of this cancer linked to breast implants reported worldwide and 36 deaths. The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) provided the figure to the Observer of 88 reports of confirmed cases in BIA-ALCL in UK patients as of 31 October. That includes some cases where the original operation was not in Britain. The cosmetic surgery industry came under tougher regulatory scrutiny in 2010 after it was found that breast implants manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Prothèse (Pip) had been filled with cheap industrial silicone unauthorised for human use. It was estimated about 50,000 British women had had Pip implants fitted, which had more than double the rupture rate of other implants. A breast implant register was subsequently set up, but it is not mandatory and thousands of women are missing from it. Carole Roberts, 61, from Derby, had Pip implants fitted at a private London clinic in 2004. They were removed after the scandal emerged and replaced with textured implants at a private hospital in Birmingham in 2012. Seven years later, she was diagnosed with BIA-ALCL. She said: “I was concerned because I found a lump under my arm. I was diagnosed with BIA-ALCL and was told by the doctors ‘this is not breast cancer, this is down to your implants’. I was in absolute shock. I hadn’t been given any warnings about the risks.” Roberts recovered after an operation to remove the implants, followed by chemotherapy and radiation treatment. She is now one of eight women represented by legal firm Leigh Day who were diagnosed with BIA-ALCL and are now planning legal action over the alleged product failures of their implants. Bozena Michalowska Howells, head of product safety and consumer law at Leigh Day, said patients needed to be better informed about the risk. She said: “There should be better warnings and closer follow-up. The breast implant registry should also be mandatory.” Sarah Moore, a partner at the legal firm Hausfeld who has worked on product liability involving medical devices, said: “Breast implants shouldn’t be seen as an extension of Botox and having your eyebrows done. These are significant surgical interventions and there can be serious problems.” She said prominent warnings on possible side effects should be provided to the patient along similar lines to the “black box” warnings used by the FDA. Suzanne Turner, professor of cellular and molecular tumour biology at Cambridge University, said the Allergan Biocell textured implant which had been linked to higher rates of BIA-ALCL was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer in July 2019. Out of 733 cases of the cancer identified by the FDA in January 2020, 620 were reported to have involved Allergan products. Turner, who is investigating whether BIA-ALCL may be linked to chemicals in implants, said regulators should consider withdrawing other textured breast implants. She said: “It should perhaps be the case that we need to understand more about the link between these implants and cancer before we let them be freely used.” She said patients who had had the implants faced a small risk and were not advised to have them removed. They should contact a doctor if they notice a sudden onset of swelling, a lump, and/or pain. Nora Nugent, a plastic surgeon and council member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps), said the MHRA was consulting on the regulatory system for medical devices, including implants, which may result in new requirements about advice given to patients. Baaps members are already advised to discuss the risk of BIA-ALCL with patients. Medical device regulations do not currently require patients to be provided with written warnings of the possible adverse effects of breast implants, but clinicians have a legal obligation to discuss the potential risks with patients. The MHRA said its consultation proposed a new requirement for information on implants to be provided for patients in leaflet or digital format. A spokesperson said: “This could include a caution that risks may emerge during the use of an implantable device.”",News/Society,Implants ‘must carry stronger warnings about cancer risk’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/25/implants-must-carry-stronger-warnings-about-cancer-risk

The late musician was a fan of Coney Island’s legendary Totonno’s, close to the site of of one of the first recorded pizza parlors established by Italian immigrants in the 1880s.  One hundred and forty years on, New York’s obsessive relationship with cheap street pizza – there are around 1,700 pizzerias across the city – is as enmeshed as ever. But there are now cracks in that union. Rent is increasing, and supply chain problems leading to inflation is pushing up the cost of oil, cheese, wheat and meat. Deliveries are spotty, tomato sauce faces higher shipping costs, and pizza boxes are scarce. Now the existence of the fabled 99¢ or dollar pizza outlets that rely on fast, high-volume trade is being threatened after nearly two years of pandemic-reduced foot traffic. That is a blow not only to the city’s image, but also to many low-income New Yorkers in times of trouble. Abdul Muhammad, owner of 99 Cent Fresh Pizza, an eight-location chain in Manhattan, said he may raise the price of his slice for the first time since opening in 2001 if costs continue to rise. “I have to think about it because my customers, many of them unemployed and struggling to make rent, can’t afford to pay more.” 99 Cent Fresh stayed open during the pandemic except for one month in March 2020, in part, Muhammed said, because he knows that for some of his customers a slice is all the food they may get. “I feel bad because everybody has had a lot of problems with the coronavirus, no jobs, everything was closed, and the food stores that were open doubled their prices. So I try to stay open to help the people,” Muhammad added. Outside the 99 Cent Fresh location on 6th Avenue and 8th street, several customers said they relied on the outlet. “I come here when I’m hungry, but I can’t come here all the time because I’m diabetic,” said Sam Pegano, who said he was homeless. “It’s important to me, especially in the winter, because it’s hot food.” Others stopping by said the dollar slice was important to their lives because it was fast and cheap. “People in New York love dollar-slice pizza because they’re everywhere around the city and they’re open late,” said NYU data science graduate Bishank Gaglani. “Whenever you need to grab a bite, and don’t know what to have, you can have a slice and you’re good to go.” Gaglani said he’d noticed that prices had been rising. “I cant imagine New York City without the dollar slice. But even if it goes to $1.50, people will still come.” Within New York’s complex pizza ecology, the 99¢ or dollar slice has a controversial reputation. Pizzerias like the famous John’s of Bleecker Street won’t touch the slice trade, opting only for complete pies. Others embellish their slices, and jacked up prices to $4 of more. The search of the perfect pizza, a quixotic undertaking, occupies some minds, including that of Scott Weiner, owner of Scott’s Pizza Tours, which ferries enthusiasts across the city by bus in that search. According to Weiner, the dollar-slice business model emerged as a business that worked next to homeless shelters. “It almost seemed like a public service,” he said. After the 2008 recession, the business expanded to high foot-traffic areas and transportation hubs. “It became late-night food for drunk people with the same economics as a $3 slice shop but with more volume,” he said. “At the same time, it lowered the perception of quality of pizza in New York, and became a shining beacon in a city that’s so expensive to live. It was like, look at how cool this city is – you can get a slice of pizza for a dollar.” While New Yorkers are forced to pick and choose their battles – high rents being common – the cheap pizza slice is a way to, in a sense, win one back. “The citizenry is empowered by the variety of pizza in New York because you can choose between getting an 12in, high-quality, great-ingredients, skilled-producer single-serving Neapolitan pizza for $18 or the dollar-per-slice at the opposite end of the spectrum,” said Weiner. Both, Weiner said, can quench the thirst – “it just depends on what the thirst is”. At the same, Weiner worries that dollar-slice chain owners have committed themselves to their pricing in their name and cannot withstand pricing fluctuations. When leases are renewed with higher rents, that alone can wreck New York’s famously tough restaurant business model – which has been hit hard by the pandemic. By some estimates, more than 1,000 New York restaurants have closed during Covid-19. But – despite current travails – New York’s pizza love affair is set to continue. After all, it has such a long past. Pizza historian Peter Regas traces the first published accounts of a pizzeria to Naples around 1845, when it was described as the “gastronomic thermometer of the market”. By the end of the century, Italian immigrants had bought the tradition to New York and established pizza ovens, often in taverns, in harbor or beachfront neighborhoods like Red Hook and Coney Island. “It’s pretty definitive that New York is the home of the pizza in America,” Regas said. The industry grew after the lifting of prohibition in the 1930s, the Great Depression and further after the second world war, spreading to Chicago. Regional differences began to develop. Chicago, home of the deep-crust pizza, has scant tradition of slice culture. The custom of the single slice, which came into being in the late 1940s, is integral to New York, despite the misgivings of more traditional pizzeria owners, said Regas. The loss of it, he believes, would be a loss to all. Regas recalled a legendary pizzeria Di Fara on Avenue J in Brooklyn. The elderly owner, Dom, who had been operating there since 1964, became known as the guy for a slice. “I went there in 2006 and there were like 50 people in his shop just staring at him,” he said. “There’s a magic to pizza. There’s an individual personality to a pizza that you don’t necessary get with a hamburger or hot dog, and that plays into the mystery and drama of the whole thing.”",News/US news,Slice of life: New York’s famed $1 street pizza under threat from rising costs,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/new-york-pizza-dollar-slice-inflation
