2/1/2022,"If you expect to be footing at least part of the cost, education planning is crucial to reducing or avoiding the hard hit to your wallet when the tuition bill comes. A 529 plan is one smart way to save, invest and pay for those expenses in a tax-advantageous way. There are two major types of 529 plans, both of which are offered by state governments: a prepaid plan, where the investor picks a specific school before funding the account (and the money can only be used for that school later on), and an education savings plan, where money is invested immediately and there are few limits on what school is eventually chosen.",U.S./MarketWatch•yesterday,"Saving for college: the pros and cons of 529 savings plans, prepaid plans and how to decide",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f8787df0-cf47-3f34-93ea-13716f033cd6/saving-for-college-the-pros.html

2/1/2022,"China Evergrande Group's Palace of Versailles-like project in Yuen Long - used as a collateral to restructure part of the company's massive debt - was recently seized by creditor Oaktree Capital, which has appointed receivers for the asset. The Shenzhen-based developer, which is saddled with US$310 billion in total liabilities, said it ""is seeking legal advice to protect the legal rights of the company"", according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange published on Sunday. It said Oaktree notified the developer about the seizure and appointment of receivers on Wednesday. ""At the same time, the company is in active discussions with the lender on resolving the matter with a view of reaching a resolution,"" the Evergrande filing said, without identifying that lender. It said the asset was charged as a security for a US$520 million loan in January last year. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Global asset management firm Oaktree, which rejected Evergrande's proposed debt restructuring plan, declined to comment. Evergrande - controlled by Hui Ka-yan, once China's richest man - said a potential residual value upon the discharge of the secured obligations involving the Yuen Long asset would be used for its offshore affairs. It said the potential sale of the relevant secured assets had no material impact on the company and its financial position. Los Angeles-based Oaktree's seizure of the Yuen Long project marks one of the most significant actions taken by an international financial institution against Evergrande, which became the world's most indebted property developer after its loan repayment issues started to mount last year. That move came after Evergrande asked its offshore creditors last week to refrain from taking hostile enforcement actions to recover their debt, as the developer makes ""unremitting efforts"" to restructure its liabilities. The embattled mainland developer told these creditors that it needed more time to evaluate the number of potential solutions before it can further engage in substantive negotiations with them, according to the firm's stock exchange filing last week. Evergrande had been looking for a buyer for that project, which covers a 2.2 million square feet plot in Yuen Long, a location that falls under the Hong Kong government's planned Northern Metropolis. The embattled mainland developer has already invested a total of nearly HK$8.9 billion (US$1.1 billion) on the project, according to a Sing Tao Daily report in August last year. The firm bought the farmland, located near the Mai Po Wetlands, from Henderson Land for HK$4.7 billion in 2019 and paid almost HK$4.2 billion last year to convert it to residential use. It planned to build a 240,000 sq ft villa ""like the Palace of Versailles"" on the land. The project will have a total of 268 villas, each built up two or three storeys, according to documents submitted to Hong Kong's Town Planning Board.

2/1/2022,"Mortgage rates were mixed in the final week of January. In the week ending 27th January, 30-year fixed rates slipped by 1 basis point to 3.55%. 30-year fixed rates had risen by 11 basis points in the week prior. As a result, 30-year fixed rates held above the 3% mark for an 11th consecutive week. Compared to this time last year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 82 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were still down by 139 basis points, however, since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. Early in the week, economic data took a back seat, in spite of weak private sector PMI and consumer sentiment figures. On Wednesday, the FOMC rate statement and press conference was the main event. A more hawkish than anticipated FED Chair, who failed to downplay monthly rate hikes, spooked the markets. The weekly average rates for new mortgages as of 27th January were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates fell by 1 basis point to 3.55% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 2.73%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.7 points. 15-year fixed rose by 1 basis point to 2.80% in the week. Rates were up by 60 basis points from 2.20% a year ago. The average fee held steady at 0.6 points. 5-year fixed rates increased by 10 basis points to 2.70%. Rates were down by 10 basis points from 2.80% a year ago. The average fee fell from 0.3 points to 0.2 points. According to Freddie Mac, Recent rate increases have yet to significantly impact purchase demand. In the past, potential homebuyers who are on the fence tend to enter the market at the start of a rate increase cycle. Rates are likely to continue to rise but at a more gradual pace. As a result, current homebuyers could continue to benefit from refinancing. For the week ending 21st January, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 3.64% to 3.72%. Points decreased from 0.45 to 0.43 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 3.64% to 3.69%. Points increased from 0.44 to 0.61 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 3.54% to 3.56%. Points fell from 0.47 to 0.38 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, which is a measure of mortgage loan application volume, slid by 7.1% in the week ending 21st January. The Index had increased by 2.3% in the week prior. The Refinance Index slid by 13% and was 53% lower than the same week one year earlier. In the previous week, the Index had fallen by 3%. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased from 60.3% to 55.8%. In the previous week, the share had declined from 64.1% to 60.3%. According to the MBA, 30-year fixed rates increased for a 5th consecutive week to its highest level since March 2020. Borrower demand for refinances has fallen as a result, with applications down for a 4th week in a row. The average purchase loan size hit a new record high $433,500. It’s a busy start to the week for the U.S markets. ISM Manufacturing PMI and JOLT’s job openings will be in focus on Tuesday. On Wednesday, ADP nonfarm employment change figure will be the key stat of the week, however. On the monetary policy front, expect any FOMC member chatter to also influence. Away from the economic calendar, chatter from the U.S and Russia will also be an area of focus.

2/1/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. will relocate its corporate headquarters to the Houston area from near Dallas and combine its chemical and refining divisions in a major shake-up aimed at reducing costs.

The changes will take place from April 1, and the headquarters relocation will be complete by mid-2023. Exxon has been on an aggressive drive to reduce costs over the past few years and is on track for $6 billion of savings by 2023, compared with 2019 levels, or enough to pay for about 40% of its dividend. The company’s executives have worked out of the famous “God Pod,” a large tree-lined office park in Irving, west of Dallas, for three decades after moving from a skyscraper in Manhattan. “Closer collaboration and the new streamlined business model will enable the company to grow shareholder value and position ExxonMobil for success through the energy transition,” CEO Darren Woods said in the statement. Exxon’s new headquarters will be in its biggest U.S. office campus in Spring, just north of Houston, which was opened under former Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson in 2014. While Exxon is one of the S&P 500’s top performers in 2022, it’s been a hard few years for the company. The pandemic forced Woods to pivot away from his $200 billion, seven-year growth strategy towards a low-spending, more capital efficient model after debt ballooned in 2020. The following year, activist investor Engine No. 1 won support from shareholders to replace a quarter of the company’s board after criticizing its financial performance and approach to climate change. Exxon rose 0.9% to $75.96 at 12:33 p.m. in New York, with Brent crude advancing 1.3%. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. (Updates with CEO’s comment in fourth paragraph.)
