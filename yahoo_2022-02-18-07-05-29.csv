2/18/2022,"The stock market appears to be making a transition in these first few months of 2022, from last year’s bullish trend to a slower pace of growth this year. Headwinds are mounting – the pandemic is stubbornly persistent, inflation is high and trending higher, the Fed is getting set to raise interest rates in response, the list goes on – and so it’s natural for retail investors and experts alike to go looking for investing advice. And one source of advice is the circle of market gurus, the hedge fund experts who have leveraged their insight into multi-billion dollar success. Ray Dalio is the exemplar of that cohort. He got his trading start some 50 years ago, and has built his firm, Bridgewater Associates, into the world’s largest hedge fund. Bridgewater manages approximately $150 billion in total assets. In short, Dalio knows how make the market works, no matter what the trends are. Looking to Dalio for investing inspiration, we used TipRanks’ database to find out if three stocks the billionaire recently added to the fund represent compelling plays. According to the platform, the analyst community believes they do, with all of the picks earning “Strong Buy” consensus ratings. Let’s take a closer look. XPO Logistics (XPO) We’ll start in the transport sector, where XPO Logistics is a freight carrier, based in Connecticut and operating as a transport broker. The company offers less-than-truckload (LTL) freight services to customers across North America, making it possible for customers to move loads that don’t require full semis, trailers, or containers. XPO can broker freight haulage for more than 50,000 shippers across 99% of all US postal codes. The supply chain crunch has driven up ground freight costs in the US, and that has redounded to XPO’s advantage. In Q4 of 2021, the company reported, in its own words, the “highest revenue of any quarter in company history.” The top line came in at $3.36 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS, at $1.34, was up 152% in the same period. And, in 4Q21, the company saw $98 million in cash flow from operations, of which $57 million was free cash flow. For the full year, the company reported $656 million in cash flow, with $475 million of that being FCF. Ray Dalio likes what XPO has to offer. In Q4, Bridgewater bumped up its holding by 248% when it bought up 79,031 shares. Now, the fund’s total XPO position comes in at 110,914 shares worth $7.72 million at current prices. Wall Street’s analysts are sanguine, too. From Deutsche Bank, Amit Mehrotra writes: “We think Street estimates incorporate some mismodeling that should result in a sharp revision higher in the coming weeks and months... We still believe there is substantial upside in shares from a plan that accelerates deleveraging and focuses the company on becoming a pure play LTL."" ""We also took away positive views from mgmt’s commentary around asset sales... We think this path could significantly accelerate the opportunity we see in shares,"" the analyst added. To this end, Mehrotra puts a Buy rating on XPO shares, and his $120 price target suggests it has room for a substantial 73% one-year upside. (To watch Mehrotra’s track record, click here) Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating on XPO shares makes it clear that Wall Street is in broad agreement with the bulls here. The 15 recent reviews break down 13 to 2 in favor of Buys over Holds, and the $97.13 average price target implies ~40% upside from the current share price of $69.39. (See XPO stock analysis on TipRanks) Equifax (EFX) As the economic activity grows, consumer credit becomes ever more important. Consumer spending accounts for some 70% of the US economy, and much of that is driven by access to credit. This is where Equifax steps in. The company is one of the three biggest consumer credit reporting agencies, with a database holding aggregated information on more than 800 million individual consumer and 88 million business around the world. Equifax operates on both sides of the credit monitoring business, selling credit and demographic data to enterprise customers and credit monitoring and fraud prevention services to retail consumers. The growth of Equifax’s business can be seen in its long-term trend. The company has seen 8 quarters in a row of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, and it’s 4Q21 top line, at $1.3 billion, was a company record – and up 12% from the year-ago quarter. EPS came in at $1.84 per share, down 8% yoy, although just above the $1.81 estimate. Management was confident in the Q4 earnings, and declared a quarterly common share dividend of 39 cents. This makes for a 13-year streak of reliable payments, and a modern dividend that goes back to 1987. Equifax boasts that it has paid out dividends for over 100 consecutive years. The current payment annualizes to $1.56 and gives a modest yield of 0.7%; the key here is not the yield, but the company’s long-term commitment to reliability. Long term reliability is an attractive feature in any stock, and Dalio clearly sees this one as attractive. Bridgewater opened a new position in EFX in Q4, buying in 14,896 shares. At the current share price, this holding is worth $3.3 million. The billionaire isn’t the only EFX fan. Evercore analyst David Togut rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $370 price target suggests a 66% upside potential for the year ahead. (To watch Togut’s track record, click here) Backing his stance, Togut writes, “In its largest business, Workforce Solutions, EFX enjoys a near monopoly in income & employment verification, reducing its historic dependence on mortgage, auto and credit card-related consumer credit reporting demand. For ‘22E and ‘23E, Workforce Solutions revenue should grow 19% and 13%, 2% and 3% above Consensus, respectively, fueled by five key growth levers: 1) incremental work number records, 2) more pulls on the TWN database, 3) deeper market penetration, 4) pricing, and 5) new market entry, all supported by new product innovation (NPI) and the EFX Cloud."" Overall, the outlook on Equifax is a Strong Buy, based on 9 reviews that include 8 Buys against a single Hold. The stock is selling for $221.73 and its $305.67 average price target implies a 38% upside from that level by year’s end. (See EFX stock analysis on TipRanks) Legend Biotech Corporation (LEGN) Last up on our list of ‘Dalio picks’ is Legend Biotech, a clinical-stage biopharma company working on new cell therapies for a range of hematological and solid tumor cancers. The company has offices and operations in the US, China, and Ireland, and maintains an active research pipeline with no fewer than 5 programs at Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials. Legend’s leading drug candidate, ciltacabtagene autoleucel (or cilta-cel), is a potential treatment for multiple myeloma – and is the subject of several late-stage clinical trials, dubbed CARTITUDE. In December, data from the CARTITUDE-1 study was presented, showing “2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 61 and 74 percent.” In addition, data from the CARTITUE-2 study showed acceptable efficacy and safety profiles in Cohort A of the Phase 2 trial. The company has received an updated PDUFA date from the FDA on cilta-cel, with agency setting this coming February 28 as the deadline. Legend, unlike many clinical-stage biopharma companies, has a revenue stream; the company receives milestone payments from partner-companies, other drug firms that have licensed their candidates to Legend for clinical work. Legend received $16.9 million in such payments during the last reported quarter (ended September 30, 2021), up from $11.7 million in the prior year. Legend also reported having $636 million in cash on hand. Biotech firms are highly speculative, but a revenue stream and an upbeat regulatory outlook are key points for investors, and may have influenced Dalio’s decision to open a position here. His firm bought 116,159 shares of Legend, which are currently worth $4.71 million. Covering this biotech for BTIG, Justin Zelin focuses on the regulatory outlook as the main catalyst, writing: “We chose Legend Biotech as our large -cap top pick as the company is focused on growing their robust cell therapy organization (1000+ employees, 10+ pipeline programs) and global commercial footprint ahead of anticipated PDUFA target date for their lead asset Carvykti (cilta -cel)… These data establish Carvikty as the best -in -class anti -BCMA autoCAR -T and clearly superior to approved anti -BCMA auto CAR -T ABECMA, supporting our confidence in likely approval.” Unsurprisingly, Zelin gives LEGN shares a Buy rating, and his $65 price target implies a one-year upside of 60%. (To watch Zelin’s track record, click here) A unanimous Strong Buy consensus, based on 4 reviews, shows that the Street agrees with Zelin’s take. LEGN has a $59.75 average price target, suggesting an upside of 47% from the current trading price of $40.85.

2/18/2022,"(Reuters) - Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, also known as Ho Wan Kwok, filed for individual bankruptcy protection in a U.S. bankruptcy court in Bridgeport, a court filing showed. Guo listed assets in the range of $50,001 to $100,000 in the bankruptcy filing, and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. Among the list of creditors who have claims against Guo, he listed Pacific Alliance Asia Opportunity fund as the one with the largest claim of about $254 million. The fund, which sued Guo for unpaid loans worth $88 million, allegedly borrowed between 2008 and 2011, has been locked in a legal battle with him in a New York State Court over this issue for four years. In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fined three media companies, affiliated with Guo, $539 million on charges of illegally selling stock and digital assets to investors.

2/18/2022,"(Reuters) -Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) urged Apple Inc investors to vote against Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook's remuneration, citing concerns around the magnitude and structure of his equity award. Apple will hold its annual shareholder meeting in the first week of March. ""There are significant concerns regarding the design and magnitude of the equity award made to CEO Cook in FY21... Half of the award lacks performance criteria,"" ISS said in a letter on Wednesday. Cook took home $3 million in salary in 2021. In addition, he received $82.3 million in stock awards, $12 million for hitting Apple's targets, $1.4 million for air travel, 401(k) plan, insurance premiums and others. In total, he earned $98.7 million in 2021, compared with $14.8 million a year earlier. He received 333,987 restricted stock units, in his first stock grant since 2011 as part of a long-term equity plan. He will be eligible to receive additional units in 2023. ISS valued Cook's 2021 equity award at $75 million. His pay was 1,447 times that of the average employee at the tech giant, according to a filing disclosed in January. ""Half of the $75 million award is purely time-based, and the award would continue to vest in full in the event of his retirement,"" ISS wrote.

2/18/2022,Mark Zuckerberg wants to completely cut off all ties between Facebook and the controversies that have marked the daily life of the social media giant over the past five years. This attempt at purification began last October when he changed Facebook's name to Meta and imposed the concept of metaverse in conversations and business circles.

2/18/2022,"2022 has started out with a marked increase in market volatility, accompanied by a sharp reversal of last year’s bullish trend. The sudden correction, and the shift to a more downbeat investor sentiment, are generally attributed to a series of increased risk factors. On the international front, these tensions include geopolitical tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border and around China’s belligerence. Domestically, factors impacting the markets include the inflation that is both high and rising; and the prospect of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. That last factor has been getting a lot of airtime recently. The Fed is widely expected to enact a half-percent rate increase next month, and at least two more such hikes by the end of the year. However, according to JPMorgan's Chief Global Markets Strategist Marko Kolanovic, these potential rate hikes are no reason for investors to worry. “We believe risky asset markets have mostly adjusted to monetary policy shifts by now,” Kolanovic writes, and goes on to add, “We expect risky asset markets to rebound as they digest these risks and sentiment improves, aided by inflows from systematic investors and corporate buybacks. We thus retain a pro-risk view with a strong cyclical tilt in our model portfolio…” So just what stocks are getting the thumbs up from JPMorgan? The firm's analysts have picked out two stocks whose price has fallen low – but in these cases, the analysts see the low price as a gateway. We ran both names through TipRanks’ database to see what other Wall Street’s analysts have to say about them. Let's take a closer look. Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE) First up is Ultragenyx, a commercial- and clinical-stage biopharma company with a focus on rare diseases. These diseases are defined by the FDA as affecting fewer than 1 in 50,000 people; as such, they have a small patient base and limited prospects for drug sales to reimburse the high costs of development. Ultragenyx spreads out those costs by operating several of its development lines in partnerships with other pharmaceutical researchers, and works assiduously at commercialization of its approved products. On that front, the company has had a measure of success. In 4Q21, Ultragenyx showed $83.4 million in total revenue, which was in-line with consensus expectations. The total included $55.5 million in revenue from burosumab (branded as Crysvita), as well as smaller sums from two other commercial-stage products. Triheptanoin (Dojovi) saw product sales of $11.8 million, while vestronidase alfa (trade name Mepsevii) brought in $3.1 million. Dojovi is still in the launching phases of its commercialization, and so its revenue number is considered encouraging. The drug had 270 US patients on reimbursed commercial therapy at the end of 2021. For the full year, Ultragenyx reported $351.4 million in total revenues. This was up 29% from the $271 million reported for 2020. The full-year gain reflects increased sales of Crysvita as well as the launch of additional drugs. The company finished the year with $1 billion in liquid assets, available for funding the development pipeline. Ultragenyx has several advanced programs in that pipeline. Notable among this is GTX-102, being researched in collaboration with GeneTx. This drug is a potential treatment for Angelman Syndrome, and is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials. The first four patients, in Canada and the UK, have received multiple doses without adverse effects. Patient dosing as begun in the US. As the next main catalyst on the calendar, the company expects to release safety and efficacy data in the middle of this year. The company’s most advanced research tracks involve two gene therapies; DTX401, for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa), and DTX301, for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. Both of these have completed early-stage clinical trials and are progressing to Phase 3 studies. The first patients in the Phase 3 GlucoGene study of DTX401 have already been dosed, while the Phase 3 eNH3ance study of DTX301 is expected to begin later in 1H22. The two studies will last 48 and 64 weeks, respectively. Despite the positive progress on the pipeline, Ultragenyx shares are down 50% in the last 12 months. According to JPMorgan 5-star analyst Cory Kasimov, this represents a buying opportunity. “As a diversified orphan disease company with tangible assets, 2022 catalysts, and a strong management team, we can no longer ignore this opportunity. The mid-year GTX-102 Angelman update is clearly the key event, and mgmt continues to sound a very optimistic tone. We acknowledge there’s a lot riding on this update…. we’re not trying to call a bottom on the market, but we are increasingly constructive on stories with real assets, pipeline optionality, and upcoming levers that offer favorable risk/reward... and we believe RARE meets that bar,” Kasimov opined. Based on the above, Kasimov sets an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on Ultragenyx shares, and his $132 price target implies an upside potential of 85% for the year ahead. (To watch Kasimov’s track record, click here) Wall Street shares the bullish sentiment here, as indicated by the Strong Buy consensus view. This stance is backed by 10 recent reviews, which include 9 Buys against 1 Hold. Shares are selling for $71.17 and have an average price target of $139.10, for a one-year upside of ~95%. (See Ultragenyx stock forecast on TipRanks) Goodyear Tire (GT) Now let’s shift gears, and look at one of the US markets’ more recognizable names. In fact, you may be using some of their products right now. Goodyear is one of the world’s top four automotive tire manufacturers, and the largest in the US. The company’s most recent expansionary move was its acquisition, completed last year, of the Cooper Tire & Rubber Company. The buyout cost Goodyear $2.5 billion. The acquisition was worth it for Goodyear, however, as the tire giant reported solid numbers in its 4Q21 and full year results. Q4 revenue came in at $5.05 billion, the highest in more than two years and up 38% year-over-year, while EPS, at 57 cents per share, handily beat the 33-cent forecast. For the full year, total revenues were $17.5 billion, a sum that just edged over the expected $17.3 billion. Annual EPS was reported at $2.09, beating the $1.82 forecast. Despite these solid results, Goodyear shares fell sharply after the report, and the stock is down 33% from the peak in reached in January of this year. The fall in stock price has been attributed to management’s concession that inflationary and economic pressures are rising against the company, and will likely worsen in the course of 2022. Goodyear faces rising costs across its supply, manufacturing, and distribution chains, on everything from labor to raw materials to shipping. The company estimates that raw materials alone will increase in cost by $700 million to $800 million in the first half of 2022 compared to 1H21. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman believes that investors have no need to panic here, nor should they avoid this stock. “The sell-off strikes us as an overreaction given what foresee as much more modest needed reductions to consensus SOI and FCF, and because pricing has been quite strong so far this cycle, with Goodyear posting its 6th consecutive positive quarterly Price/Mix-to-Raw Materials spread in 4Q, suggesting the possibility of better than currently envisaged ability to price for non-commodity costs, although these costs are likely recoverable via pricing over time, suggesting little impact to normalized SOI and FCF and with the company continuing to make progress along other more controllable fronts, such as merger-related synergies,"" Brinkman stated. In line with these comments, Brinkman rates GT an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets a $23 price target to suggest an upside of ~40% through the end of 2022. (To watch Brinkman’s track record, click here) All in all, the Street’s analysts are split down the middle on this one, although the bulls have the edge; based on 3 Buys and Holds, each, the stock qualifies with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. On where the share price is heading, the outlook is more conclusive; the forecast calls for 12-month gains of 36%, given the average target clocks in at $22.40.

2/18/2022,"By Darya Korsunskaya and Andrey Ostroukh MOSCOW (Reuters) -Possible western sanctions against Russian banks will lead to a spike in market volatility but Russia will be able to withstand restrictions thanks to abundant reserves, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday. U.S. and European officials are finalising an extensive package of penalties should Russia invade Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly denied it has such a plan. Such sanctions could target major Russian banks and its energy sector but will not include banning Russia from the SWIFT financial system, according to U.S. and European officials. Siluanov said sanctions against Russian banks would be ""unpleasant"" but the state will make sure that all deposits with banks, all transactions, including in foreign currencies, are secured. ""Thank god we have enough forex liquidity and enough forex reserves,"" Siluanov told reporters. ""They say we have a financial shield in the form of gold and forex reserves, budget surplus and [budget] rule, low debt."" If new sanctions target Russian energy companies, Russia would be ready to re-route its supplies to other markets, Siluanov said. Russia has been living under financial and economic sanctions since 2014 when the West attempted to punish it for annexing Crimea and for its role in the military conflict in Ukraine. Restrictions prompted banks and companies to reduce dependence on global debt markets, while Russia focused on replenishing reserves and developing its own financial systems as alternative to SWIFT or Visa and MasterCard. Siluanov said Russia will be able to switch to other financial systems if it is cut off from SWIFT. ""We expect the country's financial system to continue to focus inwards as part of the ""Fortress Russia"" strategy and advance digital and fintech sovereignty,"" the Institute of International Finance. Siluanov said possible restrictions on buying of Russian debt would be ""unpleasant but not fatal"" for Russia, which had nearly $635 billion in gold and forex reserves as of early February. The minister said Russia had no plans to revise its 2022 borrowing plan worth 3.3 trillion roubles ($44 billion), preferring to raise funds via OFZ bonds with fixed coupons, while also offering bonds with floating-rate coupons. Once the current situation calms down, Russia will consider testing foreign demand for Russian Eurobonds, Siluanov said.

2/18/2022,"After year-to-date net losses in all three major indexes, it’s fair to say that 2022 is not 2021. Last year saw the sustained, long-term gains that keep investors comfortable. That all came to a crashing stop early in the new year. However, while volatility has increased in recent weeks, the sharp losses that characterized January have moderated somewhat in February. There’s a feeling that the markets are starting to price in the chief headwinds – rising inflation and the prospect of Fed rate hikes starting in March. What this means for investors is easy to sum up: opportunity. Markets are just above their recent bottom, and plenty of stocks are still trading at bargain prices. And that leads to the logical next question, which stocks to pick up? The average retail investor will need a signal, some indicator of a stock’s quality, in order to sort out the wheat from the chaff – and find those bargain prices that are ready to gain. One popular signal is the trend of insider buying. Insiders are corporate officers; their company positions give them a deeper view into corporate inner workings, and potentially greater insight into corporate prospects. They quite naturally use this insight in their trading, and their published trades can give a clear hint toward their companies’ near term outlook. The Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, from TipRanks, has the filters and sorting options investors need to make sense of the market’s insider trading. We’ve used it to pull up two stocks that have seen recent ‘informative’ action from the insiders – and that are trading at bottom-level prices. Here are the details. 2U, Inc. (TWOU) We’ll start in the educational sector. 2U is a tech company offering an array of niche-specific software and tech products to the post-secondary education sector. Specifically, 2U’s products include digital coursework design, infrastructure support, and online platforms for universities and non-profit colleges. 2U’s product line is offered as software, and on the popular SaaS subscription model. 2U was an early entrant into the world of online education – it got its start more than a decade ago – and since then has built up a large network. The company works with more than 85 universities to offer over 550 academic courses – and more than 380,000 students have used 2U’s products over that time. In its most recent expansionary move, 2U this month announced a partnership with Australia’s University of Sydney to offer postgrad degree courses online. When complete, the course will offer up to four Master’s degrees for online students. The degree courses will become available in February of next year. Last week, 2U released its numbers for both Q4 and full year 2021. At the quarterly level, the company reported $243.6 million at the top line, up 13% year-over-year. The adjusted net loss for the quarter deepened, from $10.8 million to $14.9 million. Per share, the EPS loss grew from 6 cents to 20 cents yoy. Full year numbers were better. Revenue grew 22%, to $945.7 million, while the company’s total net loss situation improved by $21.7 million. At $194.8 million, to full-year net loss was $2.61 per share. 2U's shares have been falling steadily for the past 12 months; the stock is down 80% in that period. However, while the shares are down, the insiders are making purchases. Of those purchases, two, by CEO Christopher Paucek and director Paul Maeder, are considered informative. Last week, Paucek spent $251,026 on 26,040 shares, while Maeder bought 110,000 shares for $1.037 million. This stock has also caught the attention of Needham 5-star analyst Ryan MacDonald who sees 2U positioning itself for future gains. “2022 is setting up to be a year of transition for the business as edX is integrated and the company works through program launch delays and the wind-down of a margin-dilutive hybrid program with Simmons University. This, combined with difficult comps in 1H22, will result in a deceleration of topline growth to the low-to-mid teens in 2022, we estimate. Despite this projected growth slow-down and an expected $30mm - $40mm EBITDA headwind from edX, 2U still expects to deliver positive adj. EBITDA and EBITDA margin expansion in FY22. When combining this with the discounted valuation of 1.8x estimated FY22 revenue, we believe the risk/reward is attractive and view the sell-off as a buying opportunity,"" MacDonald opined. These comments support MacDonald’s Buy rating, and his $28 price target suggests an impressive 163% one-year upside potential. (To watch MacDonald’s track record, click here) So, that’s Needham's view, how does the rest of the Street see the next 12 months panning out for 2U? Based on 6 Buys and 4 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Moderate Buy. The stock trading price is $10.79 and its $27.11 average price target is decidedly bullish, implying a 12-month upside of ~152%. (See 2U stock forecast on TipRanks) Adtalem Global Education (ATGE) Next up is Adtalem, a for-profit higher education provider with a focus on healthcare education. The company provides services and coursework through 9 institutions on 27 campuses, and has a presence in over 200 countries. Adtalem is the parent company of several for-profit schools, including American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine, Becker Professional Education, Chamberlain University, EduPristine, OnCourse Learning, Ross University School of Medicine, Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine and Walden University. That last is Adtalem’s most recent acquisition, with the purchase completed in August of last year for a total transaction value of $1.48 billion. The Walden acquisition was only one of several major changes that Adtalem is undertaking. The company announced in January that it had entered into an agreement to sell off its Financial Services segment. The buyer, a Wendel Group and Colibri Group consortium, will purchase Adtalem’s Financial Services for $1 billion in cash, with the transaction closing in 3Q22. In the meantime, Adtalem is dealing with a recent fall in its stock price. The company released fiscal 2Q22 results on February 8, and saw its shares fall 12% in the immediate aftermath. Overall, the stock is down 47% over the past 12 months. The actual quarterly results were mixed. Revenue was up 58% year-over-year, to reach $371.2 million. However, analysts had expected the top line to reach $419 million. At the same time, earnings per share fell sharply – and also missed the forecast. EPS came in at 78 cents, flat from the year-ago quarter and well below the 96 cents expected. Management pointed to lower course enrollment during the pandemic crisis as a contributing factor to the company’s underperformance. Not everyone is downbeat, however. There was one major insider trade, when Michael Malafronte, of Adtalem’s board of directors, purchased 40,500 shares at more than $23 each. His total purchase price was $954,990, and his current stake in the company is worth $2.34 million. Alexander Paris, of Barrington Research, also sees Adtalem in position for future returns, and writes: “With the recent completion of the accretive Walden acquisition (August 12) and the pending divestiture of the Financial Services segment, ATGE will become a pure-play healthcare education provider with the scale and capabilities to capitalize on the robust and durable demand for skilled healthcare professionals. While there continue to be near-term challenges, primarily due to the impact of COVID (e.g., tough comps, student fatigue and reopening expense), we believe these headwinds will subside over time and that demand for healthcare professionals will continue to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.” Paris’ comments back up his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares, while his $40 price target implies ~89% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Paris’ track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 1 Buy and 2 Holds have been published in the last three months. As a result, ATGE gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Given the $31.67 average price target, shares could rise 49% in the next year.
