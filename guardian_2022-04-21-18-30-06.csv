4/21/2022,"If you Google Boris Johnson while online in India, a brilliant YouTube video shows him at the Gateway of India in Mumbai, doing bewildering things on a very small bicycle. Built during the British empire to welcome King George V on his visit to the country in 1911, it is now a tourist site populated by young lovers, wastrels, pickpockets and photographers trying to scam foreigners. The video was shot in 2012, when Johnson was mayor of London. Loiterers look on, baffled by this British man in a suit going round in circles, being chased by photographers who eventually give up. It was a strange way to promote British-Indian trade, a bit like an Indian prime minister sitting on a wild elephant in the middle of the Royal Albert Hall, telling the world that India is open for business. The goal was to increase “bilateral deals”. This term, which no one understands, is often accompanied by photos of British and Indian diplomats sitting at very long colonial tables with leather folders and tea, smiling like extras in a Raj-era film. The British look as if they can’t wait for the meeting to end so that they can go off and buy custom suits at half-price, while the Indians look relieved, probably because whatever it is they are trying to negotiate, at least it isn’t independence. At some point, someone decided that these trips to India had to look more fun. Former prime minister David Cameron played cricket in Mumbai in 2013 and wore all black, like a character in a Versace biopic. He had a couple of lovely cover-drives before he was clean bowled by a young woman. In 2016, ex-PM Theresa May visited a temple in Bengaluru and made headlines because she wore a traditional sari and got all the Hindu prayers right. In 2017, mayor of London Sadiq Khan partied with Indian billionaires and Bollywood stars, both demographics being his key constituents, as they probably own more of central London than Londoners. Johnson, when he wasn’t cycling, had enough jokes, charm, and call-backs for his visit to qualify as a standup routine. Its trade purpose, however, was more ambivalent, triggering this Guardian headline: “Boris Johnson continues to charm and confuse on visit to India.” As an Indian comedian who spends a fair bit of time in the UK, I know that a sizable section of Britain despises Johnson, his very name causing them to spew expletives, froth and even faint. That is not how he goes down in India. Among the Indian business elite he often addresses, and will again on this new visit, he reinforces the idea of an Englishman that a certain older generation of Indians know from classic BBC comedies: a mix of Basil Fawlty, Mr Bean and Jim Hacker from Yes, Prime Minister, with just the right dash of Oxbridge erudition to sound wise without remotely being so. The Indian elite audiences love that: a kedgeree of wit, posh accents, bumbling vulnerability, and praise disguised as information. He was a hit in 2012. But 10 years is a long time. India now has its own hugely popular leader, Narendra Modi, a global star who can work a stadium crowd. Modi has played to rapturous audiences from Wembley to Madison Square Garden in New York. The press have analysed how Modi’s shows differ from Beyoncé’s, as if this were a serious comparison. If Johnson wants to hold his own, we’ll need more than Mumbai cycling. There is, of course, our version of Strictly, called Dance India Dance. He could ride a tuk-tuk around the Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai (name now changed to the more tourist-friendly Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya). Or he could deliver a spoken-word performance on the drunken habits of Mughal kings, at midnight under moonlight at the Taj Mahal. The potential is endless. There have been misfires with other world leaders. US President Trump, while addressing a massive stadium in Gujarat, mispronounced the name of India’s greatest cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, calling him “Soo-chin”. Prime minister Trudeau of Canada landed wearing such garish Indian outfits that the local press thought he had come as a best man at a Punjabi wedding. Johnson knows India too well to make those mistakes. He has read enough Kipling to know that it is not fashionable to read Kipling any more. But, problematically, India no longer sees Britain as a great trade partner but as one of many options. If anything, the UAE, Russia, Israel and the US are closer, maybe because they show up with hard cash, not bike clips. India has moved on, even if its politicians still make policy while sitting in British-built buildings. Britain, meanwhile, feels like the upset ex-husband who can’t understand why it all ended.

4/21/2022,"When they talk about the pre-crisis times in Ali Pritchard’s dystopian two-hander, there is no shortage of options for which crisis they mean. It could be Covid-19, global heating or warring superpowers. Whichever it is, capitalism has ploughed voraciously on. Where once the industrial machine was content to profit from our labour, now it is after our very souls. The play starts, though, with a familiar generational schism. Two women, Julie and Isabel, are squaring up to each other in a claustrophobic space delineated by a simple scaffolding box. Julie is irritated by the time the younger woman spends online. Isabel is outraged to be instructed by someone responsible – by dint of her age – for the decay that has made real life so intolerable. It is less about lacking empathy than mutual incomprehension. Where Julie wants to escape the digital system, Isabel chooses to escape into it. The difference between our own internet and her virtual world – the Opolis of the title – is one of degree. We can construct online identities, but this one allows anyone who is “ignited” into the system to reconstruct themselves permanently. For a price, they can trade bad memories for good. It is a scenario not unlike that of Severance, the AppleTV+ series in which employees volunteer to be separated from their domestic identities during work hours. Here, the transitions are more fluid. Kay Greyson, who already has an automaton-like calm as Isabel, takes on an otherworldly air as she absorbs Wikipedia-style data. She spouts out facts on everything from AA Milne to fresh fruit before checking up on her real-time data feed. She has more knowledge than wisdom and perhaps just a touch of existential despair. Christina Berriman Dawson’s Julie, by contrast, is wedded to old-school ideas such as the possibility of death. She is torn between a maternal exasperation at Isabel’s ignorance and a sense, lurking like a half-expunged memory, that she is in part responsible. As Wilf Stone’s score rumbles disconcertingly, the brief one-acter, written, directed and designed by Pritchard, needles and prods and seems very much a part of our pessimistic age.

4/21/2022,"On a golden morning in early October, two graduate students from New Mexico State University plunge into the icy current of Leandro Creek. The small waterway flows through the 550,000 acre Vermejo park ranch, a reserve in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and the pair are in search of an unusual fish. Kelsie Field, 25, from the Department of Wildlife and Conservation Ecology, wears a pair of worn grey waders and carries two eight-gallon buckets, one full of water, the other, of scientific gear: test tubes, an electronic scanner and surgical implements. Michael Miller, 30, shoulders a large, waterproof backpack containing a battery attached to an electrode that resembles a metal detector. Researchers Kelsie Field and Michael Miller go ‘electrofishing’ in New Mexico. Photograph: Jeremy Miller Miller dips the “detector” into the creek, squeezing the handle to send approximately 300 volts through the water. While the team’s rubber boots insulate them from the shock, the resident fish are stunned and drift to the surface just long enough for Miller to net them and deposit them in the bucket. Most measure about 10 inches, though some are no larger than a little finger and a few stretch to 16 inches or more. There are just two species here. One is an embattled native, the Rio Grande cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki virginalis), distinguished by its cream-coloured skin, mottling of black spots and a vibrant orange slash under the jaw. Once widely distributed in rivers and streams across northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, it is now found across just 10% of its historical range. Today, it is reeling under the pressures of the climate crisis, habitat loss and – in the case of Leandro Creek – a hardy intruder. Miller checks in with other team members at Vermejo park ranch. Photograph: Jeremy Miller The more prolific species writhing in Miller’s net is the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). The smaller “brookies” are sleek and silvery, while the adults sport a riot of red and blue spots on their sides, and an orange belly. How this beautiful interloper from eastern North America got here is unclear, beyond that it was part of a human-aided diaspora that released brook trout into high-altitude lakes and creeks across the west. The brookies’ voracious appetites and rapid sexual maturation have spelled trouble not only for native trout such as bull, rainbow, California golden, and cutthroat, which they out-compete, but also for a host of other aquatic organisms, including frogs and salamanders. Brook trout have voracious appetites and rapid sexual maturation, giving them the edge over other species. Photograph: Nick Hawkins/NPL Brook trout may greatly outnumber the Rio Grande cutthroat here, but nearly every brookie the team captures is male. That’s because many are a lab-produced variety known as “Trojan” brook trout. They are unique in that they carry not one, but two copies of the Y chromosome that codes maleness; they have no X chromosome to pass on. Since 2018, various streams across the Vermejo reserve have been stocked with this strain in an attempt to tilt the brook trout sex ratio so far male that eventually the population will stop breeding and die out on its own. Similar efforts are under way in a handful of creeks in Idaho, Washington and Oregon, and Nevada plans to embark on its own stocking programme this summer. Until now, the main tool to eliminate invasive fish species has been the potent chemical rotenone. The trouble is that “it also kills all the other fish, including the ones you are trying to conserve,” says Colleen Caldwell, a professor of fish and wildlife at New Mexico State University and a principal investigator overseeing the Leandro Creek project. Researchers are still trying to understand if Trojan trout behave enough like wild male trout to convince females to breed with them, as well as whether they can thrive enough in their new environment to tip the scales in the Rio Grande cutthroats’ favour. But the hope is that the imposters will excise brookies from stream systems, without the need to bomb them with an indiscriminate chemical agent. Michael Miller shows a Rio Grande cutthroat caught from the stream. Photograph: Jeremy Miller Despite the method’s promise, it raises questions about ethics and unforeseen outcomes. “No matter what people say, the long-term effects of these things are just unknown,” says Marc Bekoff, an emeritus biology professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder and a prominent behavioural biologist. “Their goals might seem laudable today, but with rapidly reproducing organisms, you might not even know what’s going to happen in half a year.” Clear streams are surrounded by lush vegetation in the mountains of northern New Mexico. Photograph: Christina Selby Brook trout are, in some ways, a good problem to have. They live only in clean, cold water (Salvelinus fontinalis means “living in springs”), so their presence indicates a waterway untainted by pollution. Twenty thousand years ago, at the height of the Pleistocene, they were confined to waterways at the margins of glaciers, which extended deep into the interior of North America. As the glaciers ebbed, the species spread throughout the Appalachians, Great Lakes and deep into the Canadian interior. The Mississippi River stopped their spread farther west because it was too warm for them. It was newly arrived Europeans who helped them cross that barrier – and in large numbers. Settlers planted brook trout in streams and lakes in the Rockies, Cascades and Sierra Nevada. The railways sped its westward migration, with specially designed “fish cars” filled with eastern species, including striped bass, brown trout and brook trout. “Acclimatisation”, in vogue in the late 19th century, also accelerated the process, with adherents believing that introduced species improved ecological conditions. Trampas Lakes in New Mexico’s Pecos Wilderness is an ideal environment for both brook and cutthroat trout. Photograph: Christina Selby As a destructive force, the brook trout is in good company. In the US, 42% of endangered species have been “significantly impacted” by invasive species, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Among aquatic species, the numbers are starker, with invasives implicated in 70% of extinctions. The Trojan brook trout that inhabit Leandro Creek were made at the Hayspur Fish Hatchery, near Sun Valley, Idaho. The programme was started in 2008 at a different Idaho hatchery by Dan Schill, a now-retired fish biologist from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, after hearing a presenter at a conference mention something called the “Trojan Y chromosome approach”. “It was all a theoretical thing,” he recalls. “But it said if you could create a YY broodstock of an invasive fish and put it on the landscape then, in theory, you could shift the sex ratio to all males.” Fish culturist Tom Lindenmuth oversees operations at the Hayspur hatchery in Idaho as trays of eggs await shipping across the country. Photographs: Jeremy Miller In the incubation building at the hatchery, inside dozens of blue cyndrical tanks, are “larval” male brook trout, which look like tiny brine shrimp with their egg sacs still attached. Once the sacs have been absorbed and the fish are ready to feed, attendants give them food coated with estradiol, a form of the female hormone oestrogen. Over a two-month period, the estradiol turns their sperm-producing testes into ovaries, and the genetically male fish become capable of laying eggs. When hatchery workers breed these fish with normal XY males, 25% of their offspring will be female with two X chromosomes, approximately 50% will be typical males with an X and Y chromosome, but 25% will be the special variety key to the genetic population control scheme: males with two Y chromosomes. Some of the YYs will be given estradiol, causing them to form ovaries and produce eggs. These “feminised” YY fish are then crossed with YY males to create the hatchery’s broodstock. The other YYs will be transplanted into streams. If and when these “super-male” brook trout fertilise the eggs of wild female brook trout, they will produce 100% male offspring. Opposite the rearing vats are several rows of incubation cabinets filled with small trays containing hundreds of brook trout eggs laid by a single feminised YY male. Tom Lindenmuth, a fish culturist and manager who oversees the operation, explains that the eggs will be treated with Ovadine, a chemical that strengthens their shells for shipping. Then they will be packed in wet paper towels and ice and mailed to hatcheries in Washington, Oregon, Nevada and New Mexico. Tom Lindenmuth scoops up a handful of brook trout eggs at the hatchery. Photograph: Jeremy Miller To keep estradiol from leaching into surrounding waterways and causing a similar sex transformation in wild fish, the hatchery uses a sophisticated water recycling system. And because the fish directly exposed to estradiol never leave the hatchery, Lindenmuth explains, there is no danger that they will dose waterways, or fishers who might catch and eat them, with a concentrated dose of hormones. Back at the Vermejo reserve, well over half the fish the team have counted so far are of the Trojan variety. Field makes a quick swipe of one of the fish with a scanner, which returns a beep. This indicates that the fish contains a PIT tag, no larger than a grain of rice, which contains information such as where and when the fish was hatched and when it was released. Miller inspects the fish quickly, sliding thumb and index finger along its underbelly, which produces a spurt of milt, a milky substance containing sperm. He notes the missing adipose fin, clipped by workers at another hatchery months earlier – another clear sign that this is a Trojan. Back in New Mexico, researchers Michael Miller and Kelsie Field set about the complex tasks that will gauge the success of the project. Photographs: Jeremy Miller By the end of the second spawning season, in 2020, 75% of the fish captured in Leandro Creek were male, and almost 30% of the juveniles from test streams around Vermejo were the male offspring of YY brook trout. Miller hopes this year’s percentages will be higher. The debate around genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, and their potential to harm native species is a heated one. But while there is little doubt that scientists have reshuffled the Trojan trout’s existing chromosomes, they haven’t inserted any foreign genes into their DNA, says Schill. That makes them different from a GMO and so-called “frankenfish”. Chemically altering an organism in pursuit of a conservation goal “is not a radical departure from the kinds of things that conservationists are generally trying to do”, says Ron Sandler, a professor of philosophy at Northeastern University who specialises in bioethics. And it’s much less radical than “assisted evolution”, where novel genes are inserted to make creatures better suited to cope with human-altered environments. Some biologists question the ethics of releasing genetically modified, lab-produced trout into the wild. Photograph: Jeremy Miller Bekoff argues, however, that the approach being taken with the Trojan trout treats the significant alteration and potential suffering of animals too blithely. “If someone said to me: ‘We’re going to turn you from a male to a female’, I’d say: ‘I don’t want to be.’” Bekoff, who advocates for a humane approach called “compassionate conservation”, praises the effort to find a nonlethal means to control brook trout populations, but says that scientists often forsake the lives of individual organisms for the perceived needs of populations and ecosystems. There may be unforeseen consequences from using rapidly reproducing, modified non-native animals as a form of biological control, adds Bekoff. “You could produce a nightmare very quickly,” he says. Take, for example, the cane toad (Rhinella marina) brought from Central and South America to Australia in 1935 to help with native beetles that were ravaging the country’s sugarcane fields. The toads devoured or poisoned the continent’s endemic lizards, snakes, and birds in massive numbers. Today, Australia’s population of cane toads is estimated at 200 million despite numerous efforts at eradication. Trojan brook trout, like this one reared at the Idaho hatchery, may be the best hope for native trout species. Photograph: Jeremy Miller Schill dismisses the possibility of such a disaster at Vermejo. Unlike the toads, brook trout have already colonised the streams into which the new strain is being introduced. Moreover, those streams have barriers – some natural and others human-made – that prevent their movement out of the study area. And since brook trout and cutthroat trout are genetically incompatible and can’t breed with one another, there is no risk of creating hybrids. However, some biologists do worry about YY brook trout released into Idaho streams that contain native bull trout. The bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, is closely related to brook trout and the two can produce hybrid offspring. By the time Miller and Field finish their work at Leandro Creek, a pattern has emerged: the Trojan brookies appear to be thriving and the cutthroat, though fewer in number, are holding their own. Given enough time – anywhere between five and 15 years, if predictions hold – brook trout reproduction could cease, and Rio Grande cutthroat populations could reclaim their stream, says Miller. “Some waterways have been modified beyond any hope of repair. But in other places, we have the ability to fix our mistakes,” he says. “We have an ethical responsibility to do what we can, where we can, to restore that natural history.” The colours and patterns typical of a male brook trout.

4/21/2022,"In November last year, the five astronauts and two cosmonauts on the International Space Station (ISS) were ordered to suit up and take refuge in their capsules for fear their spaceship might be struck by flying debris. Russia had deliberately destroyed one of its own satellites with a missile, producing a cloud of wreckage that threatened the orbiting outpost. “It’s a crazy way to start a mission,” Nasa told its sheltering crew, who had arrived only days beforehand. The incident revealed how hairy Earth’s orbit has become, and it wasn’t a one-off. Two weeks later, mission controllers received another alert that the ISS might be hit by more debris. This time, Nasa delayed a planned spacewalk amid concerns that the astronauts could be in danger if they went outside. Before the week was out, yet another warning came in, this one forcing the space station to dodge a US rocket body that has been barrelling around Earth since the 90s. It was all worryingly reminiscent of the 2013 movie Gravity, in which debris from a shot-down satellite damages not just the ISS but the Hubble space telescope and a visiting space shuttle. “It’s a particular problem in low Earth orbit because that’s where everybody wants to be, and it’s where collisions have happened in the past,” says Holger Krag, head of the European Space Agency (Esa) space debris office in Darmstadt, Germany. Low Earth orbit (LEO) is any altitude up to 1,200 miles. While many satellites are far higher up, those orbits are much less cluttered. Even since the early days of the space age, there has been more junk in orbit than active satellites. No one worried that much at first: space is a big place, after all. But the amount of tumbling detritus and its combined mass has risen steadily over the past six decades. The military, space agencies and private operators launched hundreds and then thousands of satellites for spying and navigation, scientific missions, communications, the internet and more. Earth’s orbit is not the void it once was. More than 8,000 tonnes of space junk now circle the planet, a mix of spent rocket parts, dead satellites and fragments of hardware that are doing their best to defy the rule that what goes up must come down. Far above the drag of the atmosphere, old space kit can stay aloft for centuries, millennia even, where it can smash into other objects. According to the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, had the Romans launched a satellite into a 750-mile-high orbit, it would only fall back to Earth about now. “I think it’s fair to say that space is becoming congested,” says Wing Commander Thom Colledge, the station commander at RAF Fylingdales in the North York Moors. The base (motto “Vigilamus” for “We are watching”) is first and foremost an early warning system for intercontinental ballistic missiles. But the same radar that keeps watch for nukes also looks out for collisions in space. And, as more and more satellites are launched, collisions are an ever-growing danger. Fylingdales is part of the US Space Surveillance Network, which monitors about 30,000 items of space junk larger than 10cm. The network issues warnings when objects might collide, hopefully giving operators time to assess the risk and move if need be. But there are more than 100,000,000 pieces that are too small to track and eminently capable of causing damage. Travelling at more than 15,000mph, micrometre-sized particles can chip windows and dent solar cells, while millimetre-sized flakes can destroy satellite cameras or puncture astronauts’ space suits. At 1cm and above, a speeding fragment can take out an entire satellite. Operators may never know what happened. Space debris tracking at Fylingdales is performed by a military-private partnership, with the RAF operating the radar and analysts from Serco interpreting the data. They watch the heavens from the pyramid, a nine-storey building that’s been a striking landmark on the surrounding moors for the past 30 years. The three square sides of the building form the solid state phased array radar, or SSPAR, which provides a 360-degree view of space up to 3,000 miles high. The radar tracks orbiting objects by focusing a beam of energy on a region of space and analysing the reflections that bounce back. “We can pick up an object the size of a can of Coke,” Colledge says. I’ve arrived to see how the tracking is done, but to get inside the pyramid – the radar station doubles as a workplace – visitors must first ditch their laptops, phones and smartwatches. On the way to the training room, where teams learn the ropes on a simulation before taking shifts on the live system, we pass the operations centre where the real work takes place. It has a thick metal door complete with a hand wheel that wouldn’t look out of place on a submarine. Warnings of potential collisions are issued all the time. The UK Space Agency (UKSA) receives nearly 3,000 alerts a month from the US Space Surveillance Network. These are triaged and risk-assessed by drawing on data from Fylingdales, other sites around the world and sensors across the UK. The UKSA already provides alerts to some UK satellite operators and will roll the service out to the rest this year, says Jacob Geer, head of space surveillance and tracking at the agency. Many operators move their satellites if the risk of collision is more than one in 1,000, but there is a cost to taking evasive action. Dodging debris consumes precious fuel, which can shorten a satellite’s lifetime. Ideally, avoidance manoeuvres are performed days in advance, and can sometimes be incorporated into pre-planned station-keeping burns. “What you don’t want is a completely unscheduled burn,” says Charlotte Newton, a Serco spacetrack analyst at Fylingdales. Moving a satellite to avoid space debris can have other downsides, too. If a satellite has to dodge a stream of debris, it might end up in a less useful orbit. In the case of spy satellites, this could hamper what can be seen and when. The fact isn’t lost on space-savvy nations: there’s potential for space junk to be weaponised, to disrupt and degrade what others can do, and render entire orbits unusable. There are times when crashes cannot be avoided. When two dead satellites are on course to collide, all observers can do is watch and wince. When one of the satellites is operational, it will usually have a chance to swerve. But the dance becomes more complex when two active satellites are involved. There is no highway code in space, no accepted right of way. So it’s often those with most to lose who ensure disaster is averted. One of the biggest new challenges for satellite operators comes from “mega-constellations”. Companies such as SpaceX and OneWeb are launching hundreds and potentially thousands of small satellites into low Earth orbit to provide services such as global broadband access. The satellites will undoubtedly bring benefits, but they add to the congestion. In 2019, Esa took – for the first time – evasive action to avoid an operational satellite. The Aeolus Earth observation satellite fired its thrusters to dodge a Starlink satellite after SpaceX declined to move. “At Esa our assets are so expensive that we’d rather move and take the effort than have a situation where we don’t know what’s going to happen,” says Krag. Others had similar close shaves. In December, China criticised the US for threatening the lives of astronauts on board its Tiangong space station after it was forced to dodge one Starlink in July and another in October. The US said it would have let China know if there was “a significant probability of collision”. Collisions in space do happen. The most spectacular was in February 2009 when an operational Iridium communications satellite slammed into a defunct Russian military satellite at 26,000mph. The impact, 480 miles above Siberia, created thousands of fragments that continue to threaten satellites today. The incident made headlines, but many more suspected collisions are never confirmed, often because satellites are taken out by fragments too small to track. Among the debris that has accumulated in orbit are some particularly risky objects. Old Russian rocket bodies known as SL-12s are prone to spontaneous explosion, leaving their orbital paths strewn with fresh clouds of debris. Meanwhile, large drifting satellites such as Esa’s doubledecker bus-sized Envisat are sitting ducks in congested orbits. It’s this big stuff that space agencies worry about most: a major collision with Envisat could add a profound amount of debris to low Earth orbit. One theoretical concern for the future is called Kessler syndrome, where there is so much junk in a particular orbit that the debris from one collision sets off a chain reaction of more collisions, and more debris, until the orbit is off limits for years. The risk that space debris poses to satellites and humans in orbit has not stopped countries adding to the problem when they want to flex their muscles. In 2007, China destroyed a defunct weather satellite with a missile, increasing the amount of space debris in low Earth orbit by 30%. The US and India followed suit in 2008 and 2019 respectively, cluttering the environment even more. Russia’s own act of orbital vandalism last year created more than 1,500 fragments that will circle the planet for years. This week, the US announced a national ban on further so-called direct-ascent anti-satellite (DA-ASAT) missile testing and urged other countries to follow suit, claiming it wanted to establish “a new international norm” for responsible behaviour in space. Faced with a growing problem, space agencies and others are taking action. One option is to build better instruments to track debris and satellites more accurately. Modern satellites often carry reflectors that allow operators to track their trajectories precisely from laser ranging stations on Earth. Space junk is harder to track this way, but it can be done with more powerful lasers, a feat Esa hopes to achieve in the next two years from a laser ranging station in Tenerife. Having more precise information on the positions of satellites and wandering junk should slash the number of collision alerts that turn out to be false alarms. Further efforts are focused on automating avoidance manoeuvres so teams of engineers are not needed to execute every sidestep and swerve. Guidelines for space debris mitigation and, more recently, the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, published by the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, lay out how nations and companies should behave in space. Operators are meant to remove satellites from orbit within 25 years of completing their missions. For satellites in geostationary orbits, which are more than 20,000 miles high, this means nudging them up to a “graveyard orbit” well out of harm’s way. Satellites in low Earth orbit should be steered into the atmosphere where they burn up on re-entry. For large satellites that may partly survive re-entry, operators are advised to time their re-entries so plummeting remnants land in the Pacific. But not everyone follows the guidelines. While most new rockets are now “de-orbited” once their work is done, the vast majority of satellites in low Earth orbit are simply abandoned to their fate. Esa’s approach to the problem is to come up with cost-effective ways to remove dead satellites, rocket parts and large chunks of debris, and hope regulators endorse those that work. Krag favours a similar approach to national park protection, where people must leave with whatever they bring in: whenever a satellite reaches the end of its life, it must remove itself from orbit, or be disposed of by a space junk removal service. How well that works will soon become clear. Astroscale, a Japanese tech firm with a facility in Oxfordshire, hopes to offer a satellite removal service in the next few years. Meanwhile, Esa’s ClearSpace-1 mission aims to become the first to remove an item of space debris from orbit in 2025. The same mission will test a propellant kit developed by D-orbit, an Italian firm also with offices in Oxfordshire, that will steer the mission’s spent rocket body back towards Earth where it will burn up in the atmosphere. “It becomes almost corporate good practice to show that you are sustainable, to make your satellites able to move out of orbit when they reach the end of their life, or to make it possible for a company to come and retrieve or service your satellite,” says Geer. By developing the knowhow to retrieve dead satellites, the UK can build expertise for the coming “orbital economy”, he adds, where satellites are serviced and assembled in orbit. “Every year, dozens of objects are left behind that could have been disposed with their own means,” says Krag. “But that’s not happening because of the lack of technology and the lack of policy. It’s like plastic in the oceans. Would you start cleaning up the old stuff while, every year, people add more? No. You concentrate on stopping them adding more. We need to do the same with debris in space.”",News/Science,Mind that satellite!

4/21/2022,"Fifa has confirmed the investigatory chamber of its ethics committee has launched an investigation into the actions of disgraced former Canada youth national team coach Bob Birarda and allegations of sexual harassment against former Vancouver Whitecaps women’s team coach Hubert Busby Jr. Fifa is publicly downplaying the investigation, saying the investigatory chamber is “gathering information”. However, the Guardian can confirm Martin Ngoga, a Rwandan politician and lawyer who is chair of the chamber, has labeled the inquiries as “investigation proceedings”. A Fifa spokesperson told the Guardian that the investigation is only concerned with the actions of the two coaches but according to multiple sources familiar with the proceedings, the scope of the investigation also includes how Canada Soccer and the Vancouver Whitecaps responded to reports from multiple players about the behavior of the two coaches over a number of years. The investigation was launched in March following a Fifa meeting in Paris that discussed claims of sex abuse by coaches and administrators around the world. The investigation comes as a former Canada Soccer board member says the organization did not take the Birarda incident seriously when players reported inappropriate behavior in 2008 – or at any subsequent time the issue was raised. Birarda, the head coach of Canada’s U20 women’s team in 2008, pled guilty in February to one count of sexual exploitation and three counts of sexual assault related to his time as a coach in Vancouver and while coaching national youth teams and the Whitecaps women’s team. Busby was suspended from his role as head coach of the Jamaica women’s national team last year after a report by the Guardian alleged he sexually harassed a player when he was in charge of the Vancouver Whitecaps women’s team in 2010 and 2011. “The only people in the system with moral courage are the athletes,” said Leanne Nicholl, a former Canada Soccer board member who was also previously executive director of the Canadian Olympic Foundation. “Repercussions need to be higher for people not willing to have moral courage. It’s not just perpetrators [who are the issue]. It is the enablers.” The Guardian can also reveal that following reports about Birarda’s behavior from players in 2008, Canada Soccer executives failed to follow the organization’s robust rules and regulations regarding sexual harassment or sexual assault allegations. Documents seen by the Guardian outline a strict process covering all participants in the sport across Canada, including executives, coaches, players and volunteers. The organization broadly defined sexual harassment as including “sexually degrading words used to describe a person; criminal conduct such as stalking or physical and sexual assault or abuse; promises or threats contingent of the performance of sexual favors; display of sexually explicit material or pictures; unwanted physical touching; unwanted sexual flirtation, advances, or propositions.” When allegations were made against Birarda, Canada Soccer’s rules demanded the appointment of two individuals, “a male and female”, to investigate the complaint. Written reports of the investigation should have been provided to the executive committee, as well as complainants and Birarda. However, no written copy of any investigation exists and Canada Soccer, nor any former employee or board member, can confirm the existence of a written report into Birarda’s actions. Reviews of allegations against Birarda were made by Anne Chopra, a Vancouver attorney, in 2008. But, according to a source familiar with the process, no written copy exists and instead Chopra presented a verbal review to a group of Canada Soccer and Whitecaps executives that included the organization’s general secretary, Peter Montopoli. Attempts by the Guardian to contact Chopra were unsuccessful. However at the time of the Birarda incident, Canada Soccer did have in place a Harassment and Prevention Committee, according to a handout given to attendees of a meeting of the organization in 2008. A listed member of the Harassment and Prevention Committee confirmed to the Guardian the group did exist at the time. They did not want to speak on the record because they could not locate any documents relating to an investigation into Birarda. “I don’t think anyone on our committee would have made a decision or necessarily known about Birarda’s departure [because we weren’t asked],” they said. “Coaches were fired all the time and went on to other things.” Canada Soccer’s rules and regulations also state that after receiving a written report, a case review panel of three “independent people” comprising at least one man and woman should deliver their findings, provide them to the executive committee and recommend any disciplinary action. The Canada Soccer executive committee then needed to confirm the disciplinary recommendations and place a copy of the report in the personnel file of the individual. But neither Birarda nor Busby received disciplinary action after reports were made about their behavior. They were released from their roles for undisclosed reasons and both continued to coach girls and women elsewhere in Canada and the United States. A document obtained by the Guardian listing the status of coaches in Canada shows Birarda retained his B level license issued by Canada Soccer until at least 2017, even though the organization and high level executives knew about his inappropriate and predatory behavior from at least 2008. In an emailed statement, Canada Soccer claimed Birarda’s B License expired in 2011 yet the Canada Soccer Coach Licensing Program Status Check, updated in March 2017 that includes 2016 graduates of the program, lists Birada as a 2006 B License recipient. A license is considered an imperative for any professional coach to hold especially when working with elite level teams in youth or adult soccer. The Canada Soccer Status Check, described as “updated quarterly”, states its purpose is “to verify the certification of all coaches” and to locate “licensed coaches who may be interested in working with your organization”. Canada Soccer said a license “does not permit an individual to coach but indicates that the individual has completed Canada Soccer’s Advanced Coach Education Program workshop at their respective level.” Canada Soccer did not respond to a request for clarification about the expiration of Birarda’s license – an unusual claim according to multiple Canadian coaches contacted by the Guardian – and his listing on the 2017 document. The organisation also did not respond to multiple questions submitted by email about the processes it followed in 2008 or how the organization responded to reports from players about Birarda in 2008, citing an ongoing internal investigation of events in 2008 by a third-party law firm. Former Canada Soccer executive committee members, who currently have senior administrative roles in world sport, declined to discuss how the organization dealt with Birarda and the process that allowed him to continue to coach in the community. Asked to comment on the current Fifa investigation and how Canada Soccer responded at the time, Montopoli said when reached by phone: “I don’t know anything about that and I’m not in a position to speak about that right now, thank you”. Montopoli, currently chief operating officer of Fifa World Cup 2026 Canada, then terminated the call. He did not respond to further requests for comment. Victor Montagliani, now president of Concacaf and a vice-president at Fifa, was chair of the National Teams committee at Canada Soccer when players reported inappropriate behavior by Birarda in 2008. He has declined to comment beyond a statement last year citing an internal Canada Soccer investigation managed by a third party legal firm as a reason for not discussing previous events and processes. Last year, the statement issued by Concacaf said that: “The Board was in late summer 2008 informed by the CSA General Secretariat of the allegations regarding the inappropriate text messages. The Board, including Mr Montagliani, took these allegations seriously and unanimously approved the appointment of an independent Ombudswoman to investigate the matter. Following that independent investigation, the Board was provided with a summary of the Ombudswoman’s findings, which included confirmation that inappropriate language was included in text messages. All Board members subsequently approved a recommendation to terminate the coach’s employment. Mr Montagliani believes that he and his fellow Board members at the time followed the appropriate steps to support the CSA with this very serious matter.” The public, meanwhile, were told Birarda’s 2008 exit from his role with Canada Soccer and Vancouver Whitecaps after the Anne Chopra review was by “mutual agreement”. A Canada Soccer media release at the time announcing Birarda had been replaced as head coach of the 2008 U-20 national team said: “The association wishes Mr Birarda all the best in his future endeavors.” Similarly, Busby did not have his contract renewed by Vancouver Whitecaps after the club received complaints about his behavior. The coach previously told the Guardian he parted ways with the club because they wanted to “go in another direction.” Montagliani claims his role on the Canada Soccer board was non-executive although he is listed on its executive committee and as an officer of the organization for 2008. Former Canada Soccer vice-president Rob Newman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. “The board members in sport, and I don’t just mean in soccer, they are not there to do hard things,” Nicholl told the Guardian. “They are there to make sure they get a ticket to the next World Cup or the next Olympic Games. They are there to check boxes.” In 2015, during her time leading the Canadian Olympic Foundation, Nicholl accused Canadian Olympic Committee president Marcel Aubut of harassment over a period of years. Aubut subsequently resigned from his role. Nicholl told the Guardian she had attempted to revisit complaints against Birarda during her time on the Canada Soccer board in 2019, after players questioned why he was still coaching in the community 10 years after reports were made against him. “I brought it to the attention of the board … that I had been contacted by women who shared their story about Bob Birarda with me and, at best, the board’s response was apathetic,” Nicholl said. Nicholl said she met with Montopoli and then-president Steven Reed and a Canada Soccer lawyer in May 2019, in Quebec City. It was at this time police in Vancouver had begun investigating historic allegations against Birarda that would eventually lead to his guilty pleas. “I asked for the Anne Chopra review and that was when I learned that it was not in writing, that it had been delivered verbally, and there was no recollection [of an investigation] other than the fact that [the board] was not responsible and that Birarda at the time of the report was essentially not responsible for any actions pertaining to sexual assault ot sexual harassment.” Nicholl maintains that Canada Soccer and its leadership did not take allegations against Birarda seriously. “Show me the report and the action that was taken,” she said. “Birarda continued to coach in this country and Canada Soccer is the duty bearer of the sport in this country. What does serious mean? Someone put their hand up and explain to these women how they took it seriously. What were the actions taken? Birarda continued to coach.” Canada Soccer last year hired McLaren Global Sports Solutions to review how the organization handled allegations in 2008 against Birarda. The review is due this month. After a report by the Guardian last October, Major League Soccer employed Toronto law firm Rubin Thomlinson to review how the Vancouver Whitecaps handled allegations of misconduct brought by members of the Whitecaps’ women’s team in 2008 and 2011 against Birarda and Busby. No date has been announced for findings. Birada will be sentenced later this year.",Sport/Football,Fifa ethics committee investigating sexual misconduct claims in Canadian soccer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/fifa-ethics-committee-investigating-sexual-misconduct-claims-in-canadian-soccer
4/21/2022,"Boris Johnson has played down the row over another Partygate investigation saying he is focused on “the things that matter”, as he kicked off a two-day trip to India. Johnson will discuss trade and security with India’s premier, Narendra Modi, on his first visit to the country since becoming prime minister in 2019. He landed in Ahmedabad and was greeted warmly with multiple bunches of roses. The road into the city centre was lined with billboards featuring large photographs of Johnson. But the trip risks being overshadowed by the ongoing Partygate row, as MPs prepare to vote on a Labour motion aimed at referring him to parliament’s privileges committee over whether he misled the House of Commons. Johnson’s allies were forced to table a last-minute amendment on a chaotic day in Westminster on Wednesday, amid fears enough backbenchers might abstain to see Labour’s motion go through. En route to India, Johnson played down Partygate, saying he would concentrate on what he said were more pressing matters. “I think politics has taught me one thing – that you’re better off talking about and focusing on the things that matter, the things that make a real difference to the electorate and not about politicians themselves,” he said, adding, “I’m focused on jobs, growth and a fantastic partnership with India.” Asked whether there were circumstances in which he could resign over Partygate, he said, “not a lot springs to mind at the moment”. Instead, Johnson stressed the importance of securing a free trade deal with India, hinting that the UK might be prepared to relax its immigration regime in order to do so. Two rounds of talks have already taken place, with a third due later this month – and both sides have expressed the hope of securing some kind of deal by the end of 2022. The conflict in Ukraine also looms large over the visit, although No 10 has insisted Johnson will not “lecture” his host. India, which has a longstanding relationship with Russia, declined to support a UN motion criticising Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. A cabinet minister denied that the move to delay the parliamentary investigation into whether Johnson misled parliament with his repeated denials of Covid law-breaking was a cover-up. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said effectively annulling Labour’s motion by putting off letting MPs make a decision until after the Metropolitan police and Whitehall inquiries have concluded was “the right thing to do”. He told Sky News: “If you want to play politics with this, the shenanigans that Labour are attempting today is the route. If you want to follow due process then you allow the police to do their investigation, you allow the Sue Gray report to be published and then the privileges committee can look at that.” Zahawi added: “Most of my colleagues who are fair minded, who believe in due process, will vote for the amendment because it is the right thing to do.” He later told LBC radio that the government wanted to focus on pressing issues, including spiralling inflation, dealing with the backlog of six million people on NHS waiting lists, and supporting Ukraine in its fight back against the Russian military. But Chris Bryant, the Labour chair of the privileges committee who recused himself from any investigation to avoid accusations of a stitch-up, said it was “another Owen Paterson moment”. Referring to the sleaze row that exploded last autumn after the government forced Tory MPs to let a colleague avoid suspension after breaching lobbying rules, Bryant said party whips were “trying to buy time and lashing themselves to the Johnson mast when they don’t know what waters lie ahead”. Thousands of miles from the turmoil over his behaviour, Johnson visited the Sabarmati Ashram, where he was presented with a copy of a guide to London written by Mahatma Gandhi. As he read from it, the prime minister said: “Vegetarianism costs far less than meat eating.” After removing his shoes, Johnson remarked: “There’s always a panic that the socks are going to let you down.” Johnson then boarded an Indian air force chinook helicopter to open a JCB factory in Vadodara. JCB is owned by the Tory donor Lord Bamford, and Johnson has repeatedly visited its UK factories, including to bulldoze through a wall of polystyrene bricks during the 2019 general election campaign.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson visits India as Partygate row continues in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/boris-johnson-visits-india-modi-as-partygate-row-continues-in-uk
4/21/2022,"After the debate, the dissection: was Emmanuel Macron arrogant or courteous? Was Marine Le Pen dominated or passive? Hours after the marathon face-off between France’s two presidential contenders on Wednesday evening, the verdict was that Macron had emerged as the winner on the substance and Le Pen held it together on style. The exchange was a rematch of 2017’s TV debate, during which the far-right leader became aggressive. This time, Le Pen remained calm, though still floundered occasionally. Le Monde likened Macron to a boa constrictor – slowly squeezing his rival to death. The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said it was overall a satisfactory debate: “If the presidential campaign itself has been disappointing, here we saw the choice between two kinds of France, two different visions,” he told Europe 1. Jordan Bardella, head of Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) party, accused Macron of being the “number one public insult thrower” adding: “When he insults Marine Le Pen as do his supporters, he is really insulting the French.” Clément Beaune, the Europe minister, accused Le Pen of seeking to organise a Frexit by stealth. “On this subject, it was clear that Marine Le Pen did not have a project and that she had just cut her Frexit into smaller pieces,” he said. Gabriel Attal, a government spokesperson, said Le Pen had “changed her style but not the substance”. He accused Le Pen of wanting to “divide the French”, echoing Macron’s accusation that her proposed ban on the Islamic headscarf would cause “civil war” in the city suburbs. Pollsters Elabe questioned viewers after the debate and declared that 59% found Macron more convincing compared with 39% for Le Pen. Among supporters of the radical left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose 7.7 million voters both presidential candidates are chasing, the poll found 61% judged Macron convincing against 36% for Le Pen. Only 29% of those asked found the far-right leader displayed “the most qualities necessary to be president”. Macron was deemed to be more dynamic, slightly more sincere and with the better programme than Le Pen. Half judged Macron to be “more arrogant” than his rival, while Le Pen was considered “worrying” by about half.",News/World news,Macron comes out on top in French election TV debate with Le Pen,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/macron-comes-out-on-top-in-french-election-tv-debate-with-le-pen
4/21/2022,"Sleep Sound with Jamie DornanAudible, all episodes out nowSome might argue that listening to Jamie Dornan’s voice on a snooze-inducing podcast is something of a waste. A very sexy waste. But Dornan’s deep, Northern Irish tones transport you to a Mexico beach and a desert storm, complete with swooshy sound effects, as he works his sleepy witchcraft – and it does work. With six episodes to choose from, this is definitely not one to listen to in the middle of a meeting. Hannah Verdier TypecastWidely available, episodes weeklyHere’s a fun game: casting novels (mainly romcoms) for the big screen. From Rare Birds Book Club, each episode hears hosts Rachel, Roxane and Flodive into a book and make a passionate case for who should play the characters – while asking big questions such as “which Hollywood Chris is the hottest?”. This season: The Love Hypothesis and Fifty Shades of Grey. Hollie Richardson Very Scary PeopleWidely available, all episodes outTrue crime fans can binge all episodes of this no-holds-barred retelling of the infamous mass murder in Amityville and its subsequent ghostly legend.

HV Will Be WildWidely available, episodes weeklyWas the January 6 insurrection just a practice run for a bigger protest? Trump Inc’s Andrea Bernstein and Ilya Marritz take an in-depth look at the attackers, the people who tried to prevent it and the victims of that violent day.

HV Tiffany Dover is DeadWidely available, episodes weeklyNurse Tiffany Dover fainted on camera after having her Covid jab, fuelling a frenzy of anti-vaxxers who claimed she’d died (despite the fact that she got up again.) NBC News reporter Brandy Zadrozny investigates how the conspiracy theory spread, particularly after Dover disappeared off social media, fanning those misinformation flames. HV This week, Elle Hunt chooses five of the best podcasts for those looking for love, from a strident defence of singledom to advice on sex in the age of social mediaThis Is Dating“Come for the cringe, stay for the connection.” From the producers of Where Should We Begin? With Esther Perel, this podcast lets us listen in on a blind date. There’s some secondhand embarrassment and the occasional car crash, but judicious input from a team of experts behind the scenes – including behavioural scientist turned dating coach Logan Ury – elevates this beyond straightforward voyeurism. Each episode is an intimate and engaging study of how to fan the flames of connection (or not, as the case may be), perhaps to apply to your own first date. Solo: The Single Person’s Guide to a Remarkable LifeThere is lots of sensible advice here, whether you’re currently dating or not. Dr Peter McGraw – a behavioural economist, business school professor and lifelong bachelor – shares his advice for men and women of all ages seeking to transform themselves “from a single, to a solo: that is, to recognise the value of personal autonomy whether you’re single for now, or for ever.” Some episodes bust myths about single living or solo parenting, or suggest approaches to finding love and connection outside a romantic relationship. The Second CircleThe Second Circle bills itself as “the podcast that takes sex seriously”. Created and hosted by the journalist Franki Cookney, past episodes have explored how to approach sexual desire, habits and routines with a refreshingly pragmatic emphasis. Every sexual advice column stresses the importance of communication, she points out – “but very rarely do we acknowledge how freaking difficult it is”. In the podcast’s most recent fourth season, Cookney explores what makes sex good or bad, why we might not fancy it at all, and how we might go about having it more, and better. Sex, Lies & DM SlidesIn this Spotify podcast – started during the pandemic, when many people’s sex lives migrated online – TV cook Gizzi Erskine and writer and model Sydney Lima take on the “weird, wonderful and sometimes disturbing world of sex and love in the age of social media”, when Instagram can double as a dating app and a direct message could be a dick pic. Erskine and Lima invite their celebrity guests – from comedian Sofie Hagen and journalist Jon Ronson to the founders of some of the world’s most exclusive sex parties and clubs – to share choice morsels from their public inboxes. The result is a funny, frank and free-flowing discussion of the etiquette and ambiguities of dating in the digital age. Dating While GrayWriter Laura Stassi hosts this compassionate survey of later-in-life dating, informed by the experience of her marriage ending after nearly 30 years. “Dating is like a home-improvement project … it doesn’t go as smoothly as you thought it would,” she says. But Dating While Gray approaches the challenge with gentle pragmatism and good humour, and from an admirable range of angles, for listeners perhaps steeling themselves to dip a toe into unfamiliar waters. Too often discussions of dating can be limited to just apps: this podcast explores whether dating coaches are worth the money; how to approach sex with a new partner; the wisdom of reaching out to former old flames; and takes into account the paradigm shift of the pandemic.
