12/10/2021,"The prime minister’s now director of communications addressed staff and handed out awards at a party in Downing Street last Christmas that is now under investigation, it has been reported. Jack Doyle, who was then deputy director of communications at No 10, addressed up to 50 people at the gathering on 18 December 2020, ITV News reported.  Doyle spoke to the press office to thank them for their work, as he did every week, and presented some awards to mark the team’s efforts, it has been claimed. Downing Street and Doyle have been approached for comment. Political commentators have said Doyle’s presence at the party is significant because as director of communications he would have been behind the government’s confused messaging since the revelations of the party surfaced in the Daily Mirror. Ministers have repeatedly told reporters they did not know what happened or if a party took place – but were sure no rules were broken. Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that an internal investigation led by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, would look into reports of a staff gathering held in Downing Street just days before Christmas, when London was under tier 3 Covid restrictions. The investigation was subsequently widened to include another festive celebration and a reported staff leaving do. After it emerged Doyle reportedly spoke at the event, the Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “The government’s internal investigation has been exposed as the sham it is. The investigation has only just published its terms of reference, and we are already seeing more details from the media than the Cabinet Office about the parties.” Alongside the alleged party on 18 December, Case will include in his review a confirmed gathering at the Department for Education’s Whitehall headquarters on 10 December last year, and a reported leaving event for a No 10 aide – allegedly attended by Johnson – on 27 November. The terms of reference for the investigation, published on Thursday, said “where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated”. The two alleged events in December coincide with when mixing between households in London was restricted, with England in a month-long lockdown in November. Case’s inquiry was ordered by the prime minister after a leaked video emerged showing Downing Street aides laughing about a “fictional” party at No 10 in December 2020.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s senior aide ‘gave awards at No 10 Christmas party’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/boris-johnson-jack-doyle-awards-no-10-christmas-party
12/10/2021,"Two days of one-way traffic on Vulture Street had threatened to derail England’s Ashes campaign from the outset but through a resumption of Joe Root’s remarkable form in 2021, and Dawid Malan’s personal penchant for Australian conditions, a hugely impressive fightback was finally marshalled on the third. By stumps it felt like their tour had finally begun in earnest. Root was unbeaten on 86 from 158 balls, fresh from overtaking Michael Vaughan’s record of 1,481 in a calendar year, while Malan was 80 not out from 177. England appeared to require snookers when 147 proved their maximum on day one but through the pair’s unbroken stand of 159, one that saw the tourists reach 220 for two, just 58 behind, hope was building.  Both Englishmen batted beautifully to set up their respective series. Root was back in the controlled bubble that has returned six centuries since the start of January, with risks removed, Nathan Lyon swept confidently and the seamers repelled. He had spoken of setting the record straight in Australia before this series and, having battled through cramp, and worn blows to the body and knee, a new highest score in these parts had put words into action. More importantly, however much Australia remained favourites to take a 1-0 series lead, the pair had delivered an important reminder to others that life does get easier once the Kookaburra ball has lost its shine. If Lyon can be successfully milked, the pressure on the seamers increases. Root, at the crease for eight of England’s 10 century stands this year, was always likely to be one to deliver this. But back in the UK there is every chance that Ed Smith, the former England selector, was nodding away in his pyjamas about Malan also. It was Smith who dropped him back in 2018, with the conclusion that his game was perhaps better suited to overseas hanging over the left-hander for some time. Yet as ill-judged as that comment was, given Malan’s sensitive nature, it was one not without some basis either. Now an experienced campaigner at 34, and with a century in Perth four years ago to his name, Malan is a player who clearly thrives on bouncier surfaces. There was one narrow escape here when a ball from Lyon missed his off-bail by less than two centimetres, plus a review for caught behind on 23 that showed nothing on HotSpot despite Australia’s belief to the contrary. But otherwise he hunkered down to perfection, with one imperious driven four off Pat Cummins arguably the shot of the day. Needless to say that on a day when one brave England supporter successfully proposed to his Australian girlfriend in the stands, the alliance that formed out in the middle was desperately needed. When Mark Wood speared a yorker into the stumps of Travis Head on 152 in the morning to terminate Australia’s first innings for 452, a first innings deficit of 278 runs looked as sheer as California’s El Capitan. After raiding his century the previous evening, Head helped plunder 83 runs in the space of 20.3 overs, mowing Jack Leach square to bring up his 150 from just 148 balls and bringing up three figures in the left-armers runs column to boot; coming in 12.1 overs, Leach’s gallon is now the fastest in Ashes cricket. At least the return of Ollie Robinson and Ben Stokes with the ball allayed concerns over their fitness. Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed gambolled off the field to strap on their pads, the former having been the embodiment of his side’s misery up to this point after a diamond duck on the first morning and the inexcusable drop at slip that gave David Warner halfway through his eventual 94. Moments like this are when Test cricket offers unrivalled torture for the player and sees the audience reach for the popcorn. Australia’s fielders were given plenty of material too when, for just the third time in 30 Tests (and the first without a nightwatchman at the other end), Burns declined to face the first ball of the innings. But despite this briefly delayed rematch with Mitchell Starc delivering instant drama third ball, Burns given out lbw on the field, salvation followed when the review showed the ball to be going over. Reaching lunch unbeaten on 13, with England 23 for no loss, Burns could soon breathe a bit easier. But the bounce that saved Burns (and was yet to return a single lbw by the end of the eighth session) proved the undoing of both openers after the restart. Cummins got his fifth ball to rear off the surface and take the shoulder of Burns’ bat for a simple slip catch. And though Hameed lined up well for the second time in the match, showing courage under fire and again ignoring the Queensland heat by batting a cable-knit tank top, a strangle down leg off Mitchell Starc made it scores of 25 and 27 for the match. This was smart captaincy from Cummins, who after the fall of Burns had then held himself and Josh Hazlewood back in the hope of hitting Root with fresh legs. But from 61 for two, still 217 in arrears, Root got himself off a pair fourth ball and, alongside Malan, set about constructing two sessions of determined yet positive resistance. With Hazlewood sending down just eight overs to prompt questions over a possible niggle, and Warner off the field all day after being struck in the ribs by Ben Stokes 24 hours earlier, the headaches were finally not just English ones.",Sport/Sport,Root and Malan’s unbroken 159 leads England fightback in first Ashes Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/england-australia-day-three-ashes-report-first-test-root-malan
12/10/2021,"Britain’s economic recovery had almost come to a halt even before the onset of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19, official figures have shown. The Office for National Statistics said in October – the first month after the end of the government’s furlough scheme – output grew by only 0.1%.  The slight monthly rise in gross domestic product was weaker than had been anticipated, with a poll of economists having expected growth of 0.4%. In September the economy grew by 0.6%. A breakdown of the data showed signs of a sharp drop in people going to restaurants, pubs and bars even before tougher curbs were brought in this month. Gross domestic product was still 0.5% below its pre-crisis peak in February 2020 at the end of October. Of the three main sectors of the economy, only services expanded in October, with higher spending in the shops and an increase in face-to-face GP appointments contributing to a 0.4% rise. However, production – which includes manufacturing, energy and North Sea oil and gas – was down 0.6%, while a shortage of materials because of supply chain problems resulted in a 1.8% drop in construction output, the steepest since the start of the pandemic in April 2020. Grant Fitzner, the chief economist at the ONS, said: “While GDP growth slowed in October, the UK health sector again grew strongly while secondhand car sales and employment agencies also boosted the economy. Taken as a whole, the dominant services sector reached its pre-pandemic level for the first time in 20 months. “These gains were offset by a drop in restaurants, which fell back after a strong summer, and reduced oil extraction and gas use. Construction also saw its biggest drop since April last year, with notable falls in housebuilding and infrastructure work, partly driven by shortages in raw materials.” Over the three months to October, the economy expanded by 0.9% – a marked slowdown on the growth rates posted as it emerged from lockdown in the spring and summer. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said: “We’ve always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery but the early actions we have taken, our ongoing £400bn economic support package and our vaccine programme mean we are well placed to keep our economy on track. “We have still been recovering quicker than expected, with more employees on payrolls than ever before and redundancies remaining low.” Alpesh Paleja, the lead economist at the lobby group the CBI, said: “Growth disappointed in October, reinforcing concerns about the resilience of the UK’s economic recovery to the Omicron variant and the impact of further restrictions.”",News/Business,"UK growth virtually stalled in October, even before Omicron",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/10/uk-growth-virtually-stalled-in-october-even-before-omicron
12/10/2021,"In July 1968, the visionary US guitarist John Fahey – whose albums, with names such as Death Chants, Breakdowns & Military Waltzes, hadn’t exactly been money-spinners – was out the back of a record store. “I saw all these cartons of Bing Crosby’s White Christmas,” he later recalled. “The clerk said it always sells out. So I got the idea to do a Christmas album.” The New Possibility: John Fahey’s Guitar Soli Christmas Album has not achieved the ubiquity of Merry Xmas Everybody or Last Christmas, but it served its role. Purists might sneer – Mojo magazine once dismissed the album as “Cliff-territory bland” – but The New Possibility has never been out of print, selling more than 100,000 copies. Fahey ended up making five Christmas albums, and they served as a financial bulwark in a career that had its share of vicissitudes.  This tactic has become bigger business than ever. Christmas music has always done well – in Nick Hornby’s novel About a Boy, one of the characters lives off the royalties from a festive hit – but in the internet age it has assumed a new importance thanks to playlists on streaming platforms. Spotify alone has 44 different options on its Seasonal Playlists page – leaving aside the vast number compiled by users – offering you hits, carols, punk, jazz, Disney and metal among many other genres. The first track on the first playlist is Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You. It’s a song so big that it’s pretty much an industry all of its own. It has risen up the UK and US singles charts faster than ever during the past two years as listeners reach for festivity amid the bleakness, resulting in startling figures: the first holiday song to be certified diamond (that’s above platinum); more than a billion streams on Spotify. In 2019 alone – when it reached No 1 in the Billboard chart 25 years after its release – it had 309m streams across all platforms in the US. (In second place was Brenda Lee’s Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree with a comparatively paltry 193m plays.) Quite how much money the song has generated for Carey is uncertain, but last year George Howard, associate professor of music business and management at Berklee College of Music, estimated that she was likely earning $10m a year from it. Certainly, she now puts on Christmas shows every year, modelled after old TV variety shows, complete with present-clutching kids scampering across the stage. These revolutionary effects of streaming on Christmas music can’t be overstated. “Lots of independent artists who have ended up on one of these Christmas playlists can have a semi-viable career as a musician,” says Jamie Cullum, who has just released The Pianoman at Christmas – The Complete Edition, an expanded version of his album from last year. “Through streaming, the casual listener has moved on to mood-based listening,” he explains. “It’s unlikely you’d put on a mood-based playlist if you’re a record nerd, and that’s fine. But the idea of having a mood-based playlist that is part of your life is a very powerful thing for an independent artist. My listenership on streaming goes very high around this time of year, since having my first Christmas song out four years ago.” Conrad Withey runs Instrumental, a company that analyses data from streaming services and social media to spot musical trends. “Before streaming, Christmas music was about gifting: an album by a known artist, or you’d repackage Christmas tracks as a Now! Album,” he says. “You’d get a lot of radio play for the old songs, but none were released as singles. Streaming has transformed that.” What streaming – and social media – have shown is that for all the complaints about Christmas starting earlier every year, it’s not entirely down to rapacious capitalism: it’s our fault, too. Withey says Christmas tracks start to build momentum from early November. “Because people put on a playlist and listen to everything, tracks from lots of playlists make their way back into the chart. Christmas music is no longer defined by retailers and labels.” At the time of writing, one-third of the UK Top 30 is old Christmas songs. By the time the presents are unwrapped, it will be even more tinselly: last Christmas Day, 14 of the Top 20 singles were old Christmas songs; two were new Christmas singles; and two were novelties released for the Christmas market. Only No 19 and 20 had nothing whatsoever to do with sleigh bells, snow or Santa. In the album chart, Michael Ball and Alfie Boe’s Together at Christmas went to No 1 last December, later followed by the king of contemporary Christmas, Michael Bublé: his 2011 festive album has sold 12m copies, and should return to the Top 5 this week. This year brings new Christmas albums from Norah Jones, Kelly Clarkson (whose 2013 single Underneath the Tree might be the most recent addition to the Christmas song canon) and a host of country artists, as well as Gary Barlow. His first seasonal album, The Dream of Christmas, is a mixture of originals and covers. He remembers the moment he realised that the public appetite for festive music was far greater than he had ever imagined. “I was at [radio station] Magic the year they were launching 100% Christmas” – in 2017, Magic put a Christmas-music pop-up station on air; since then the main station has gone totally Christmas for the season – “and I said, ‘What? All day long? That’s never going to work.’ And of course, what do I know? Everyone loves it.” There’s a reason Barlow’s album is the way it is. A large chunk of his audience wants the man who wrote Back for Good and Shine and Never Forget and all the rest of the Take That hits to be singing his own songs. But, equally, it’s Christmas, and to make an impact you need to give people songs they know and already love. “Christmas is one of those things you should be careful not to mess with too much,” he says. “Like when you go: ‘We’re not going to have turkey this year, we’re going to have a goose.’ And everyone the following Christmas goes: ‘Jesus Christ, bring me that turkey back, will you?’ Reinterpret it a little bit, but don’t try and reinvent it. So I felt like four original songs and 12 classics is quite a good balance.” The success of the old Christmas songs, though, means getting new ones noticed is harder than ever. The tactic of Ed Sheeran and Elton John, currently at No 1 with Merry Christmas, was to stockpile sleigh bells and make the most quintessentially Christmassy song imaginable. “It’s easier for people to listen to covers,” says Leona Lewis, who has this year reissued her 2013 Christmas album as Christmas, With Love Always, with a couple of newly recorded tracks. “Originals are definitely harder, which is why it’s so amazing how Mariah Carey has transcended and become so huge. Everyone talks about her voice, but she’s an incredible songwriter.” “Original music is hard [to promote] anyway nowadays,” Barlow says, “especially at the place I’m at in my career. But the thing is, with Christmas albums, you’ve got to be stubborn. You’ve got to be proactive with these [new Christmas] songs and make sure you try and give them a moment every year.” Lewis and Barlow, of course, are at the upper end of things – Lewis’s One More Sleep is another of the rare modern songs to have entered the Christmas pantheon. They are the kind of artists who measure success in a very visible way. Below that level, though, the pressure to have high chart placings is less important. “If you look at the charts, it’s very hard to make an impact at that level,” Withey says, “but if you talk about artists targeting streams, it’s really accessible. Streaming has opened subgenres to a global audience. What we’re seeing is artists able to target quite large playlists, but not necessarily the top Christmas playlists. Do an acoustic version of Mariah and find your way on to a more specialist playlist – that can still drive millions of streams.” Withey’s company, Instrumental, also helps artists release music – it is behind LadBaby, the maker of the last three Christmas No 1s, and very possibly this year’s too – and, Withey says: “We’ve got one track that gets multiple millions of streams from being on a Christmas jazz playlist. In the global market you can make lots of money without troubling the charts, and you don’t need a major label to do it.” If all this makes Christmas music seem cynical, that’s the fault of the times. In fact, for decades artists have made Christmas records because they – like everyone else – grew up loving them. Gloria Estefan duets with Nat King Cole on a new Christmas album, A Sentimental Christmas With Nat King Cole and Friends. “Christmas music highlights the season,” she says. “It’s a feeling. I start playing Christmas music way before Christmas, because the season is too short for me.” To be part of the lineage of A Christmas Gift for You From Phil Spector, and those other records that soundtrack the season, she says, is “a privilege and an honour”. It was Sufjan Stevens’ 2006 box set, Songs for Christmas, that made Cullum feel that a festive album “was a viable artistic thing to do, and not just a cash in”, he says. “When I put the Sufjan Stevens record on – and I know my records aren’t like that – it really gives me a feeling that Christmas has started, and I love digging that record out every year. It makes me feel warm. It makes me feel like my family are close. It makes me think about people I’ve lost. As an artistic statement, it’s a valuable thing. I felt I would like to do something like that.” For Lewis, Christmas was about listening to her favourite Motown artists. “So for me it’s always been a relationship of love,” she says. “There are some major Christmas records that became part of my Christmas every single year, like the Stevie Wonder and Phil Spector records.” And this year, of all years, maybe we need Christmas cheer more than ever. Barlow made his record to lift his own spirits, as much as anything. “Last Christmas was such a bloody letdown,” he says. “We usually have a big Christmas with family, and of course we had none of that last year. In an attempt to extend the life of Christmas I was nipping off into the studio on the 27th, 28th and starting to write these songs. So when the new year came and I went in to my record label, everyone said: ‘Oh God, this should be a Christmas album.’” Yes, Christmas music is big business, but it’s more than that. It answers some deep need for a great many people. It’s not just the sound of money; it’s the sound of home.",Arts/Music,Rockin’ around the Christmas streams: why festive music is bigger than ever,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/rockin-around-the-christmas-streams-why-festive-music-is-bigger-than-ever
12/10/2021,"Jay hates fish because of a distressing childhood experience, but it means I can’t have it either  I can’t cook fish for me and my boyfriend, Jay, in our shared flat, and it’s getting annoying. I do most of the cooking and I really love seafood. When we were in lockdown I was bored with the usual meat dishes and craved a bit of salmon, but Jay insisted that we didn’t buy any. It’s a big compromise as I’m Portuguese and have grown up on wholesome, healthy fish all my life. Lockdown brought home how much I’ve missed the cooking of my childhood. Jay needs to come round because it’s affecting our mealtimes together. All our joint meals are fish-free so if I want seafood, I cook it when he’s away. One time Jay was out for a work meal and I thought, great, I’ve got free rein, and fried up some mackerel in a pan. Jay came back early and completely overreacted, saying “whoa, that stinks.” He kept washing the pan over and over and wouldn’t use it for a week as he thought the fish smell lingered. We can’t go out to seafood restaurants either. And when we do eat out, Jay goes crazy if I order fish. In fact, he hates it so much that if I’ve got fish on my plate I’m not allowed to use my fork to try some of his food. He’s so fearful of the flavour, even though I ensure there’s never any fish on the fork. It’s irrational and ridiculous. We usually split dishes and bills 50/50, but if I’ve ordered a fish dish, he will tell me I have to pay more because he didn’t get to try my order. Jay says he hates fish because when he was six, his dad gave him pasta mixed with a can of crabmeat that was three years past the sell-by date. It was disgusting. Since then he’s not been able to stomach seafood of any kind. I would like him to try fish again: he’s an adult now and surely our tastebuds change over time. I tell him the crabmeat episode was a long time ago and that he could try a prawn, but he tells me I am forcing him to eat something that makes him feel sick. It’s time for Jay to try and update his palate. I was traumatised by seafood as a child, and my tastebuds do not need ‘updating’ I reject the idea that Ines isn’t allowed to cook fish in our flat. She’s strong-minded and if she wants to cook seafood, she will. I think she’s just learned that, because I hate it so much, it’s simply easier if she waits until I’m away. What’s wrong with that? I compromise, she compromises. I’ll admit, I’m not over the moon when she cooks fish at home, but I just ask her to exercise caution if I’m there. The only times I have overreacted are when we had one non-stick frying pan to share between us, and I had to use it directly after her. Fish can leave a strong aftertaste and smell. For that reason, when we eat out at restaurants, I’d rather she didn’t stick her fishy fork in my food. I won’t stop her ordering a mound of molluscs, but I don’t want to taste them, thanks very much. I’ve been traumatised by seafood. At six, my dad gave me bad crabmeat and I was violently ill. I also used to work on a fish counter at Sainsbury’s and had to fillet mackerel. Fish guts got stuck to the bottom of my shoes. Once, I went on holiday and left my work shoes in my car and when I returned the stench was awful. Recently, Ines forgot to turn on the extractor fan when she was cooking, which turned our home into a marine smokehouse. There was a putrid stench in the flat for days, just like the one from my fish-gutting days. It brought all those horrible memories back. I told her that this couldn’t happen again. I’m a reasonable man, but boundaries had to be set after incidents like that. Now if fish is cooked, appropriate ventilation and extraction are required and I need prior warning. I need to sign off Ines’s fish-cooking plans, so I’m prepared. Ines is the primary cook in the house because she’s better at it than me. I’ll eat whatever she wants most of the time, but if she tells me prawns are on the menu then a little part of me dies inside. We’re never going to agree on that. My tastebuds don’t need “updating”, as she puts it. I’m quite happy never tasting fish again, and Ines shouldn’t try to force it down my neck if the mere smell triggers me. Should Jay try to overcome his aversion to fish? Is it a food phobia or just a dislike? Jay uses words like traumatised – if so, he should get professional help. Jay’s idea of compromise is not mine; he could agree to her cooking some fish at home, and cook other things himself.Maureen, 69 Ines has compromised enough. Going crazy when ordering fish; paying less because he couldn’t try her order; “signing off” on cooking plans? Jay, I sympathise with you hating fish, but if you really don’t want it, you could cook your own meals. And then try some sustainable halibut.Tristan, 45 Stuck on a desert island, would Ines crave her prawns or her partner? If the former, there’s something fishy going on here! So long as Jay isn’t using his phobia to control Ines, I’d shell out for a second pan, agree to some “fish days”, and buy Jay a takeaway.Iona, 49 It’s a battle between Ines’s longing for Portugal and Jay’s unresolved childhood trauma. Those are more important things than the smell of fish. They should share a session with a friend or counsellor and talk about the underlying issues. The words fish or seafood are not to be mentioned.Bas, 52 Jay claims to be reasonable but seems to underestimate the strength of his reactions and the effect they have on Ines. It’s ridiculous that Ines should be held hostage by his pickiness. Maybe it’s not the tastebuds but the boyfriend that needs updating.

12/10/2021,"Two Democratic senators have resisted Joe Biden’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large businesses, illustrating problems the US president faces even within a faction of his own party, despite having the support of scientists and public health experts. The US Senate on Wednesday evening voted to overturn the mandate as new cases and hospitalizations continue rising in the country.  The West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, who co-sponsored the bill, and Montana’s Senator Jon Tester crossed Democratic party lines to vote yes and join 50 Republicans in their political opposition to the public health policy. The bill is seen as a largely symbolic gesture, since it would also need to pass the Democratic-led House and would probably be vetoed by Biden. The mandate was already put on hold by a federal appeals court, and the future of the mandates will likely be decided by courts, not lawmakers. But the vote showed the significant political problems Biden has faced in carrying out his public health policies to combat the pandemic. He has encountered virtually implacable Republican opposition – now joined by rebel Democrat senators – that has ranged from ideological concerns over how far government power can be exercised to fringe conspiracy theories and quack science. Manchin, who is vaccinated and boosted, said the rule represents federal overreach, which is why he co-sponsored the bill. “It is not the place of the federal government to tell private business owners how to protect their employees from Covid-19 and operate their businesses,” he said in a statement, nonetheless urging “every West Virginian and American to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their loved ones”. West Virginia, which has the third-highest rate of deaths from Covid in the country, and Montana, where some health systems instituted crisis standards of care, have suffered devastating surges throughout the pandemic. Half of all West Virginians and half of eligible Montanans are fully vaccinated, both lower than the national average. Public health experts fear the mandates, and political opposition to them, have further cemented the politicization of health policies. West Virginia has joined other states in suing to undermine the mandates for large businesses and government contractors, both of which have been blocked by federal courts. Governor Jim Justice has said there’s “no chance” vaccines will be mandated in West Virginia schools. “The data is very clear that mandates work,” Christopher Martin, a physician and professor at the West Virginia University School of Public Health, said. “I don’t know of any other measure right now that would get more people vaccinated other than requiring them to do so.” There is a long precedent of strong vaccination requirements in workplaces and schools in West Virginia and around the country. But concerns over the Covid vaccines combined with political polarization have “unintended consequences” because “people are mistrustful of governments”, Martin said. The opposition is not based on public health concerns but on civil liberties and other arguments. “That starting point of not wanting the vaccine in the first place again arises from this broad and inherent mistrust in institutions,” he said. “People perceived these institutions to fail them.” In West Virginia, widespread job losses over the past several decades have eroded trust in the government. The vaccine mandates expose larger societal rifts, Martin said. “Vaccinations in particular in this current climate have really exploded the problems that we have in our society.” Officials, including in public health, “need to begin the exercise of restoring trust”, Martin said. In the meantime, vaccine mandates will work like seatbelt laws once did, gradually becoming the norm, he said. “It improves compliance, but it takes a long time.” The US is now seeing an average of more than 119,000 new Covid cases and 1,700 deaths every day.",News/US news,Biden faces vaccine mandate pushback from own party despite support of scientists,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/10/joe-biden-vaccine-mandates-democrats
12/10/2021,"Magnus Carlsen is on the cusp of victory at Dubai this weekend after Ian Nepomniachtchi visibly wilted following their marathon 136-move sixth game, the longest in world championship history. The Russian went on to blunder away a key pawn in game eight, then allowed his bishop to be trapped in the Norwegian camp in game nine. A soporific draw in game 10 left Carlsen 6.5-3.5 ahead in the best-of-14, needing just one win or two draws in this weekend’s three games to retain his crown and take the lion’s share of the €2m prize fund.  Barring a miraculous fightback by Nepomniachtchi, the final rites will be viewable, live and free with closeups of the players, instant computer assessments, and grandmaster commentaries, on a variety of websites. Newcomers and casual viewers can start with the Guardian’s own entertaining rolling commentary by Bryan Armen Graham, which follows the action move by move, then brings the key quotes from the post-game press conference. Average players and novices can learn from the three-time British champion David Howell and England’s No 2 woman, Jovanka Houska, on chess24.com. Click the adjacent link there, and you have an online commentary for experts by the fast-talking world No 7, Anish Giri, and the all-time No 1 woman, Judit Polgar. The chess.com all-American commentary team is headed by the articulate and shrewd world No 4 and 2018 title challenger, Fabiano Caruana, while the official Fide site has wise and perceptive summaries by the former champion Vishy Anand. Opinions vary on which is the best of the several competing sites, but the overall position is sure. This is the best world championship ever for following as an armchair spectator, and a huge positive contrast with the last title match in London 2018, when there was a concerted attempt to create a virtual monopoly for the pay-per-view official site. Nepomniachtchi may be down and almost out, but he is assured a place in the eight-player 2022 Candidates. If he wins that, then historical parallels – Vasily Smyslov in 1954 and 1957, Boris Spassky in 1966 and 1969, and Garry Kasparov in 1984 and 1985 – suggest that he will have benefited from the harsh learning experience to make a much better fight at a second attempt. Of course, a second shot is far from guaranteed, and any of Alireza Firouzja, Ding Liren or Caruana will be more likely contenders. For Carlsen, barring an unlikely slip-up this weekend, the outcome provides the most convincing match performance of his four championship defences since 2014, and edges him closer to becoming generally accepted as the all-time No 1 ahead of Kasparov and Bobby Fischer. The joker in the pack remains Carlsen’s repeated hints that at some stage he will retire from Fide title competition and only take part in a series, akin to the online Champions Tour, where games at two-hour rapid rather than four-hour classical become the norm. Could that happen as early as next week? It seems unlikely, given that in the next few years there will be a growing public demand for a Carlsen v Firouzja championship match at classical time rates. Three top English GMs, Michael Adams, Luke McShane and Gawain Jones, narrowly lost 8.5-9.5 to a Rest of the World team at the London Classic. Individual scores were RoW: Nikita Vitiugov (Russia) 4, Boris Gelfand (Israel) 3.5, Maxime Lagarde (France) 2; England: Jones 3.5, Adams 3, McShane 2. The most eye-catching game occurred right at the start, when McShane fell into an ambush where Black’s two bishops and knight overwhelmed the English queen. The King’s Indian Attack is Nf3, g3, Bg2, 0-0, d3, Nbd2, e4-e5, Re1, Nf1, h4, Bf4, Nf1-h2-g4, Qd2 and preparing a tactic against h6. This formation, popularised by Fischer more than half a century ago, is an easy to remember plan for players rated under 2000. Various counters are known for Black, including long castling, but in McShane v Lagarde in England v ROW the 2019 French champion unleashed a dynamic response to the KIA which is worth remembering. The low-key English Women’s Rapidplay at the London Classic revealed a bright hope for the future, as its winner, WIM Lan (Lisa) Yao, won impressively against the favourite, IM Harriet Hunt, and went on to take the title with Hunt second. Yao, 21, recently transferred federations from China to England, where she expects to graduate from UCL next summer. She performed well in world youth events in her teens, and scored 5/9 at Hastings 2019-20 including draws with two English GMs. Her peak Fide rating is 2342, which, combined with the quality of her play, suggests there is much more to come. Yao said that after graduation she plans to contend for the WGM and IM titles, and will play for Wood Green in the 4NCL national league, She is also an official Fide trainer, and hopes to coach English girl talents. Long ago, England women were bronze medallists in the European championships of 1997 and 2001. Results since then have been disappointing, but a squad of Yao, Hunt, Houska, and Katarzyna Toma could realistically aim for at least the top 10 in major international events. England women’s teams and individuals have traditionally been granted just a small fraction of the backing accorded to the top GMs, but now there is a strong case for that to change, and for Yao to receive regular coaching at GM level with a view to aiming for the women’s global elite. 3793: 1 Re7!

12/10/2021,"Scott Morrison has signalled Australia is likely to open up to international students and skilled workers next week, while health authorities continue to weigh up whether to adjust the timing of booster shots. The federal government revealed it would extend emergency powers for a further two months to February 2022, keeping in force mandatory mask wearing for international flights and restrictions on international travel from countries deemed high-risk.  The impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was top of the agenda for the final national cabinet meeting of the year, but Morrison said his government was inclined to reopen to international students and skilled workers on 15 December. That was originally due to happen at the beginning of December, but it was delayed to allow authorities to gather more information about the Omicron variant. Asked on Friday whether the borders would open on that date, Morrison said the government was “taking more advice at the moment, but that is certainly our disposition”. He planned to “keep moving forward, not to go back”. Despite Morrison’s upbeat message, the federal government has decided some measures need to remain in place for longer. The chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, briefed national cabinet that Australia was “still in the early stages of understanding the Omicron variant”, according to a summary issued by Morrison’s office. The meeting noted that the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, had extended the human biosecurity emergency period under the Biosecurity Act to 17 February. Hunt said the arrangements, which have been in place since March 2020 “to protect Australians during the Covid-19 pandemic” and extended several times, would continue based on health advice. Hunt said the two-month extension would “allow the important measures currently in place to continue as the government continues to reopen Australia and act decisively to respond to the emergence of the Omicron variant”. That would see the extension of mandatory pre-departure testing and mask wearing for international flights, restrictions on international travel from high-risk countries, and restrictions on outbound international travel for unvaccinated Australians. But the federal government is keeping open the option of revoking any of these rules earlier than February “to take into account the latest medical advice”, as more information is gained about Omicron. The extension will also continue restrictions on the entry of cruise ships to Australia. But Hunt said the government would “continually review, on a monthly basis, whether the current restrictions on cruise ships can be safely lifted or amended”. The meeting also received an update from the national vaccination coordinator Lt Gen John Frewen on administering vaccine boosters and delivering them across Australia. That follows the announcement that children aged five to 11 will be able to receive the Pfizer Covid vaccine from 10 January. The Labor MP Alicia Payne told Sky News: “I think parents will really welcome this approval for children. I know many parents have been really hanging out and waiting for their children to be able to be vaccinated.” Fewen briefed leaders “on the plans to close the gap in vaccination rates between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the general population, and on preparations under way to administer Covid-19 vaccines to children aged 5 to 11 years, including targeted communication strategies”, Morrison’s statement said. National cabinet decided to update existing Covid-19 outbreak management plans to protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities “in light of the Omicron variant and current outbreaks in the Northern Territory”. The Northern Territory detected four Covid cases in Katherine, as a cluster linked to three crowded households continued to grow. Earlier, Morrison gave a hint that the federal government was considering bringing forward booster shots. “We are continuing to review the evidence about how that time period for the booster shot might be able to be reduced … and we’re working with the medical experts on those issues,” he told reporters in Sydney on Friday morning. Morrison played down the severity of the illness caused by Omicron, saying that was “potentially quite a game changer with the pandemic around the world about how the virus may well step down, but we’ll see”. National cabinet is next due to meet in February, when it will consider fresh advice from Kelly and the Doherty Institute on what threshold should be met to move to phase D of the national reopening plan. The meeting on Friday noted “significant progress in reopening Australia”, with Western Australia set to reach 80% over-16 double-dose vaccination coverage within days, meaning all parts of the country will have entered phase C of the plan. Morrison told 2GB radio he did not believe state premiers would rush again to close domestic borders, suggesting the response to the Omicron variant had been “a good test” of holding their nerve. He praised the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, for not closing the state border and the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, for the imminent reopening of its border. Morrison urged all Australians who had their second Covid-19 vaccine dose at least six months ago to come forward to receive booster shots, “because that will be important as we go into next year”. Queensland reported on Friday four new locally acquired Covid-19 cases and two interstate-acquired cases out in the community. Queensland’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, said a Gold Coast lockdown was unlikely but urged residents to get vaccinated and wear a mask. “Today is the day that we’ve been planning for,” she said. Victoria recorded two new cases of the Omicron variant among travellers who landed in Melbourne from Dubai on 30 November.",News/Australia news,Australia likely to reopen to international students and skilled workers next week,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/australia-likely-to-reopen-to-international-students-and-skilled-workers-next-week
