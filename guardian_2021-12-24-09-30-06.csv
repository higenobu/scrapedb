12/24/2021,"The celebrated woman of letters Joan Didion has died at the age of 87. The author and journalist made a profound mark on 20th and 21st century literature with her writing on culture, politics and the vagaries of human life. Her debut essay collection, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, captured the hazy disorder of a changing US in the 60s, and became a touchstone in the emerging New Journalism movement.  Didion leaves behind a legacy that includes five novels, six screenplays and 14 works of nonfiction – one of which, The Year of Magical Thinking, she turned into a play. The former Observer literary editor Robert McCrum credited the book, which narrates the year after the death of Didion’s husband, John Gregory Dunne, with “chang[ing] the nature of writing about bereavement”. (Their daughter, Quintana, died soon after, a cruel loss chronicled in Blue Nights.) With cool, spare prose, Didion famously positioned herself as an onlooker – of incendiary trials, of Hollywood royalty, of her own life. An early “master of the personal essay”, her style influenced and inspired countless others – her name became a byword for good writing; her lines so-often quoted that they became cliches in themselves. Starting her career after winning an essay competition at Vogue, she was also feted as a style icon, a luminary of California cool. A writer’s writer, a cult figure of fashion, an intellect gazing unflinchingly at what most interested and troubled her – what do Joan Didion and her work mean to you? We’d love you to tell us in the comments.",Arts/Books,Open thread: what did Joan Didion mean to you?,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/24/open-thread-what-did-joan-didion-mean-to-you
12/24/2021,"A controversial New Zealand scheme that offers visas to wealthy foreign investors has resumed operating after a year’s hiatus due to the pandemic, prompting concern from overseas New Zealanders who fear it will place additional strain on the country’s overburdened managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) system. Martin Newell, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Grounded Kiwis, said the scheme’s resumption would prompt “disbelief” among New Zealanders overseas, who may lose out on MIQ spots to the investors.  “The government is abandoning the needs of its citizens in favour of those who have enough money to be able to buy their way into the country.” Immigration New Zealand (INZ) recently granted 32 visas to people who pledged to invest at least $10m locally over three years and another 76 visas to individuals pledging to invest at least $3m, according to the news website Stuff. INZ is yet to decide on a further 816 applications across both categories. The visas add up to a financial commitment of at least $548m. According to an INZ spokesperson, the agency has begun processing applications for multiple visa categories – including the humanitarian and family categories – not just for investors. With their visas in hand, investors may apply to compete for spots in New Zealand’s congested MIQ system. A stay in MIQ is a prerequisite for entry to the country, which has been largely closed to non-quarantined international travel since March 2020 to protect against Covid-19. Due to a shortage of MIQ spots, thousands of New Zealanders have not been able to return home. It's really interesting who exactly gets permission to throw their hat into the MIQ ring at the cost of reducing spaces (and chances) for NZers to enter for events such as family emergencies and funerals https://t.co/Xst3wnVqFI Seerwan Ali Jafar, an Auckland resident whose mother has been unable to travel and visit her grandchildren due to MIQ difficulties, said the investor scheme’s resumption was “outrageous and offensive. Kiwis can’t enter to see family but the wealthy can buy their way in. It’s intolerable.” The scheme’s restart comes after a delay in the resumption of quarantine-free travel for New Zealanders. The Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, said the reopening day would be pushed from 17 January to the end of February due to uncertainty over Covid-19’s Omicron variant. The turnaround ensures that difficulties surrounding access to MIQ will continue into 2022. According to information released under the Official Information Act, New Zealand’s policy of granting visas to wealthy investors reached its height in 2016-2017 when 446 wealthy investors were granted visas. There has been speculation that at least some of these investors, like the American billionaire Peter Thiel, may have applied because they saw New Zealand as a safe haven for a potential doomsday scenario. Justin Pemberton, a documentary film-maker focused on economic inequality, said the scheme created a two-tier immigration system. “If you’ve got money, you can come through. If you don’t you can’t … It’s a very crude and reductive way to operate”. Due to the emergence of Covid-19 and the closing of New Zealand’s borders, just 51 investor visas were granted in 2020-2021. Some were controversial. The Google co-founder Larry Page applied for an investor visa in November 2020 and was accepted in February 2021. The rapid approval sparked frustration given the long delays many migrant workers have experienced getting visas for themselves or their families. Even as INZ resumes granting investor visas, that visa backlog for migrant workers continues: the government recently introduced a fast-tracked residency visa for such workers, with as many as 15,000 workers stuck in New Zealand eligible to apply.",News/World news,Locked-out New Zealanders outraged as visa scheme for rich foreigners resumes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/locked-out-new-zealanders-outraged-as-visa-scheme-for-rich-foreigners-resumes
12/24/2021,"Boris Johnson has invoked the teaching of Jesus Christ to urge the public to get a Covid booster jab, in a message issued to mark a Christmas he said would be “significantly better” than last year’s. In a video statement filmed in front of a Christmas tree in Downing Street, the prime minister celebrated members of the public who were “getting jabbed not just for themselves, for ourselves, but for friends and family and everyone we meet”.  “That, after all, is the teaching of Jesus Christ, whose birth is at the heart of this enormous festival – that we should love our neighbours as we love ourselves,” he said. His words echoed the message from the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who said earlier this week: “I would say, go and get boosted, get vaccinated. It’s how we love our neighbour. Loving our neighbour is what Jesus told us to do. It’s Christmas, do what he said.” The prime minister said he could not say the pandemic was over, but pointed out that many people were able to celebrate with more family members this year than last. “If this year you need a bigger turkey and there are more sprouts to peel and more washing up to do, then that is all to the good, because these rituals matter so deeply. And I hope that people will enjoy this Christmas this year all the more keenly because of what we had to miss last year,” he said. There had been fears the government might impose limits on socialising over the festive period in a bid to slow the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, but ministers decided to wait and monitor the data. In 2020, some parts of the country, including London, the home counties and the east of England, were placed under tier 4 restrictions just days before Christmas that meant a “stay at home” order was in place. Elsewhere, up to three households could gather, but only for a single day. The NHS has accelerated the pace of booster vaccinations significantly since the arrival of Omicron, and in some parts of the country will continue to deliver jabs even on Christmas Day. Johnson was baptised a Catholic but has rarely discussed his own religion. He married his wife, Carrie, at the Catholic Westminster Cathedral earlier this year. When ITV’s Robert Peston asked if he was a practising Catholic, Johnson replied: “I don’t discuss these deep issues.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, used his Christmas message to mark the contribution of frontline workers, including soldiers and nurses, during what he called an “incredibly difficult” year. “For too many, there will be one less chair at the table for the Christmas meal. But, in the darkest of times, Christian values of kindness, of compassion and hope have shone through. Communities have come together to help one another,” he said. Looking forward to 2022, Starmer said: “If we stick together, support each other and work together, we can find a path through. I know a better future is possible.”",News/Politics,"Getting Covid booster follows ‘teaching of Jesus Christ’, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/24/covid-booster-jab-boris-johnson-christmas-message
12/24/2021,"NHS England has said there are 200,000 vaccination appointments available on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day and urged anybody due a booster to consider coming forward “to get the gift of a jab”. Staff and volunteers will continue to deliver jabs in some locations on 25 and 26 December, as the NHS tries to meet Boris Johnson’s target of giving everybody eligible a booster by the end of the year amid a surge in the number of Covid cases.  Vaccination centres that were open “over the festive period” included Redbridge town hall in north-east London from 10am to 5.50pm and Grim’s Dyke golf club in Pinner, Middlesex, the NHS said. Walk-in appointments can be obtained in Eastbourne, Dewsbury and Hartlepool. Dr Emily Lawson, the head of the NHS Covid vaccination programme, praised those willing to work over the Christmas weekend and argued that people should consider getting a booster as a last-minute present to family members. “This Christmas, before sitting down to your dinner with your family, I would encourage anyone not already boosted to come forward, book an appointment and get the gift of a jab,” the NHS official said. The latest figures show that 840,000 people across the UK received a booster on Wednesday, the seventh consecutive day that jabs exceeded 800,000, taking the number who had received a third jab to nearly 31.7 million. Daily vaccination rates have leapt by about three-quarters in a little over a week as the NHS has rapidly organised to try to meet Johnson’s pledge, opening more sites, increasing hours and calling for volunteers to help. But health service chiefs had no warning that the booster jab target was being brought forward to help tackle the sudden upsurge in Covid cases, and reaching the goal has become increasingly demanding. About 13.2 million are people yet to be boosted, with nine days to go before the end of the year. Allowing for a day off to account for reduced vaccination rates over the holiday period, that would mean 1.65m jabs a day would need to be given to hit the target. Sajid Javid thanked NHS workers for their commitment to helping dramatically increase vaccination rates. The health secretary said: “You have shown our country at its best and achieved phenomenal things this year including delivering our turbocharged booster rollout.” Everybody over 18 is eligible for a booster if their second jab took place more than three months ago and they have not caught Covid in the past 28 days.",News/Society,NHS urges people to get ‘gift of a jab’ at booster centres open on Christmas Day,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/24/nhs-urges-people-to-get-gift-of-a-jab-at-booster-centres-open-on-christmas-day
12/24/2021,"People are less likely to shake hands and hug people they do not live with than they were before the pandemic, a poll suggests, while separate research indicates that anxiety levels have increased markedly in the run-up to this Christmas. Data collected by YouGov and the PA news agency suggests that nearly two-thirds of people shake hands less now than they did before Covid-19 and more than half have cut down on hugging people they do not live with.  Meanwhile, provisional figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that more than a third of adults are experiencing high levels of anxiety, the highest proportion since the UK’s third national lockdown in January. The latest official data suggests the proportion of adults experiencing high levels of anxiety has reached 38%. Such high anxiety levels have not been seen since similar data was collected between 13 and 17 January this year. The average level of anxiety experienced by adults – calculated as the mean of all anxiety levels expressed on a scale of one to 10 – is also at its highest since January. The ONS said the rating had been increasing since the end of November, and the 4.3 average figure recorded this month had not been seen since similar figures were collected between 27 and 31 January. The ONS estimates are based on a poll of 3,314 adults in Britain done between 15 and 19 December this year as part of its opinions and lifestyle survey. Other widespread behavioural changes identified in the YouGov research include the use of hand sanitiser more often and the observance of social distancing around people whom respondents do not live with. About half of the people surveyed said they were more inclined to wipe down trolleys or baskets in supermarkets, and more than a third said they were more likely to meet people outdoors. The poll of 1,652 people in Britain also investigated feelings about the pandemic and what it will mean for the future. A third of people said they thought it would never be effectively over in the UK, while 4% thought it was already effectively over. A majority thought it would be over within one or two years. And the survey suggested that fewer people felt their lives had returned to normal since the emergence of the Omicron variant than had felt that way before. In the first two days of this month, 20% of respondents said they felt a return to normality. That proportion fell to just 12% in the latest data.",News/Society,"Hugging has slumped under Covid, anxious Britons tell pollsters",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/24/hugging-covid-anxious-britons-survey-yougov-pa-ons
