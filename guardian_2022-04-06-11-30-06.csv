4/6/2022,"The understated doctor who became an unexpected star of New Zealand’s pandemic has resigned after two years leading the country’s Covid response. Dr Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand’s director-general of health announced his resignation on Wednesday, and said that it had been “a huge privilege”. “It’s a complex and challenging role at any time, and the last two years I don’t think could have been more complex and challenging,” Bloomfield said. “I’ve been thinking for a while about what’s the right time for me to step down. It seems we’re at a good point in terms of the pandemic, the response is shifting [and] I’m also confident that the system is in good hands.” Bloomfield was a softly-spoken public servant who became a household name, meme, and often-beloved, sometimes-controversial public figure as the country grappled with its first two years of Covid-19. During significant outbreaks, the doctor was a calm and regular fixture on television, providing daily live-streamed updates on case numbers, infections and transmissions. His presence was such a constant as the country reeled from its first waves of infections that it made headlines when he took his first day off. Bloomfield became synonymous with New Zealand’s Covid response, and its success in the first stages of the pandemic in eliminating the virus and continuing normal life. While the country is now experiencing widespread Covid-19 outbreaks, high vaccination rates mean it has maintained some of the lowest death rates in the world. The doctor’s prominence was perhaps itself a reflection of the country’s focus on placing the advice of scientists at the heart of its Covid response, at a time when some other countries had focused on political leadership while sidelining public health officials. “There’s not many public servants I have got to know as well as Dr Ashley Bloomfield,” prime minister Jacinda Ardern said in a tribute to the director-general’s tenure. “He has been central to our Covid success as a nation, and he’s done it with humour and grace”. Ardern has occasionally referenced Bloomfield poking fun at her as she tackled her own epidemiological learning curve, and said “I’ll keep the details of his sporadic mockery of me to myself”. “In every sense of the word – through his tireless dedication, his focus on people, his calm and considered approach – he has been a true public servant,” she said. Bloomfield provided New Zealand with moments of humour as well as epidemiological updates. Occasionally, his conferences provides fodder for a wave of memes: including for responding with a long, blinking silence when asked questions about then-US president Donald Trump’s speculation that people should inject themselves with bleach to cure coronavirus infection; or about Instagram influencers’ assertions that Covid was caused by 5G. He became a point of pride and fascination for some New Zealanders: shops sold mugs and tea towels emblazoned with his likeness and a petition was launched to name him New Zealander of the year. His fame grew as his public health announcements were set to dubstep at a music festival, informal fanclubs appeared online, and he became inspiration for some ill-advised fanfiction, including a romance novella. “When we spoke about his decision to move on, he mentioned that he wanted to spend time with his family, and that’s the least we owe him,” Ardern said. According to local media outlet Stuff, Bloomfield “worked 12-hour days, up to seven days a week, through much of the pandemic”. Speaking to media on the afternoon of his resignation, Bloomfield spent his prepared remarks discussing the evidence for booster shots and other public health measures as winter approaches, and encouraging parents to ensure their children’s vaccinations were up to date. Asked by reporters about his tenure and the way New Zealanders had responded to him, he said, “​​throughout the last two years I’ve heard from New Zealanders all across the country, a huge number of messages of gratitude and support - not for me for me and my role but for the work that our team has done… through those very tough times and as I sat down and steeled myself to ring the minister at all hours of the day and night, [that’s] one of the things that’s carried me through and I know it’s carried my staff through.” Asked for his highlight of the past two years he said, “high vaccination rates”. Asked if he had any thoughts of running for parliament, he said, emphatically, “Not a jot.” Bloomfield’s tenure at the helm of the ministry of health has not been without controversy - the ministry has faced criticism for its failure to quickly implement programs using mental health funding, and for editing down mental health reports. The ministry also faced a court case over not sharing Māori Covid-19 vaccination data with health providers, and criticism for racial inequities in the Covid response. Bloomfield will step down at the end of July 2022, the public service commission confirmed in a statement. “Dr Bloomfield has demonstrated remarkable resilience and courage in leading the health system’s overall response to Covid-19. That response has saved lives,” Public Service Commissioner Peter Hughes said. “I know many New Zealanders will also be thankful for the job he has done.”",News/World news,"Dr Ashley Bloomfield, who led New Zealand’s pandemic response, resigns",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/dr-ashley-bloomfield-who-led-new-zealands-pandemic-response-resigns
4/6/2022,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given the UN security council a harrowing account of atrocities in his country and demanded Russian leaders “be brought to justice for war crimes”. Zelenskiy called for an international tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials of Nazis after the second world war, speaking of Russian forces: “There is not a single crime that they would not commit there.” Atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha are “only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days,” Zelenskiy said, adding that there were many more that the world had yet to learn the full truth about. “Russia wants to turn Ukraine into silent slaves,” he said. The Ukraine president also questioned the ability of the UN security council to provide security. “The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn’t. For anyone,” he said in his nightly address. “Now Kyiv is the capital of global democracy, the capital of the struggle for freedom for all on the European continent.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he will “never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed” in Bucha. Speaking at the UN security council in New York, he said the war in Ukraine is “one of the greatest challenges ever” to the “international order”. The UN undersecretary general for political and peacebuilding affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, said allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces include “gang-rape and rapes in front of children”. The Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said between 150 and 300 bodies may be in a mass grave by a church in the town of Bucha. She did not say how the authorities had reached the estimate. Satellite imagery of one Bucha street published by Maxar Technologies from 19 and 21 March appears to show several bodies in exactly the same position as in video footage and photos taken this weekend in the same street.The UK’s ministry of defence said eight bodies had lain on the street for at least ten days before the town was reclaimed from Russian forces. Displaced residents of Bucha should not yet return to their homes because there are still mines in the area after Russian troops withdrew from the town, its mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said. Fedoruk said about 3,700 civilians had stayed in Bucha, which had a pre-war population of about 37,000, throughout the Russian occupation. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the evidence from Bucha shows “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities” by Russian forces. “The reports are more than credible. The evidence is there for the world to see,” he told reporters. The UN human rights office spokesperson, Liz Throssell, said all the signs from Bucha pointed towards civilians having been directly targeted and killed. At the UN security council, India condemned the killing of civilians in the Bucha and called for an independent investigation. Israel also condemned Russia’s “war crimes” in Ukraine in a statement. The Kremlin said allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha were a “monstrous forgery” aimed at “denigrating” the Russian army. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that remarks by US president Joe Biden calling for Russian president Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes were unacceptable and unworthy of a US leader. On a visit to Trostianets, a town close to the Russian border, the Guardian found evidence of summary executions, torture and systematic looting during the month of occupation. Yuriy Bova, the mayor of Trostianets, said it was too early to give a reliable estimate of how many civilians the Russians had killed, saying it was: “definitely more than 50, but probably not hundreds”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Nato and G7 foreign ministers meeting on Wednesday and Thursday will discuss the delivery of advanced weapons to Ukraine. Ammunition, medical supplies and “high-end” weapons systems would also be discussed, he added. The US and its allies are planning more sanctions on Russia with the objective to “deplete the resources that Putin has to continue his war against Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The new penalties will include a ban on all new investment in Russia and greater sanctions on its financial institutions and state-owned enterprises. Separately, the US Treasury Department moved to block any Russian government debt payments with US dollars from accounts at US financial institutions, making it harder for Russia to meet its financial obligations. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the EU is also proposing new sanctions against Russia, including an import ban on coal worth €4bn (£3.3bn) per year. The package will include a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, a ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels accessing EU ports, as well as targeted export and import bans. US Army Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States should look at the development of more bases in eastern Europe to protect against Russian aggression, but rotate forces through them rather than make permanent deployments. Milley suggested the conflict would extend beyond Ukraine and continue for “at least” years. Almost two hundred Russian diplomatic staff have been expelled from European countries this week in a direct expression of governments’ outrage at the killings of Ukrainian civilians. In what amounts to one of the biggest diplomatic breakdowns of recent years, 206 Russian diplomats and embassy staff have been told since Monday they are no longer welcome to stay by governments in Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere. British prime minister Boris Johnson urged Russian citizens not to fall for Putin’s propaganda, and to circumvent tough internet censorship rules by installing technology to discover the full extent of war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 42 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-42-of-the-russian-invasion
