12/30/2021,"The slump in school trips to the UK described in your article does not surprise me at all (‘Almost unsaleable’: slump in school trips to UK blamed on Brexit, 26 December). I’m an English teacher at a German secondary school, and in 2022 I have to take my A-level English class on a week-long trip. In the past 12 years I’ve always taken them to England. We spent a lot of money on those trips: four nights in a hotel, meals, theatre visits, guided tours, plus the money the students would spend on food and shopping. It was always possible to go to the UK because, it being a school trip, I could take all the students, even the ones with a non-European passport. However, this has now changed. Some of our students have a non-European passport (we have students from Russia, Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia). These students would have to apply for a visa and pay the fees. Or stay at home. Neither is an option for our school. So, with a somewhat heavy heart, I booked a trip to Dublin.Karen BrandesCologne, Germany   The challenges posed by the post-Brexit regulations for educational trips from the EU to the UK, which have led to the collapse in bookings, are obviously of economic significance for this segment of the travel industry. However, the effects are much more far-reaching, as Morag Anderson suggests in your article. As a former secondary school teacher, I organised yearly trips from Cologne to Canterbury, which encouraged students to use their language skills and to learn about British culture. The trips to the UK helped to compensate for the fact that exchanges between German and English schools were becoming more difficult to organise, as fewer UK students were learning German. Now students travel elsewhere – to Italy or Austria, for example. At university level, the Erasmus programme has been cancelled post-Brexit, and its replacement, the Turing scheme – which in any case is not focused on European exchange – has been taken out of the competent hands of the British Council. Boris Johnson often speaks of “our European friends”, but European friendship and understanding depend, among other things, on language competence and dialogue. Young people must be given this chance from an early age. Words alone are meaningless.Brigid HoffmannCologne, Germany  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We have all been told to get tested before seeing friends and family over the new year holiday. Shortly, parents will need to have tests available for their children returning to school.

12/30/2021,"EU exporters of cheese, car parts and other goods are facing a mountain of red tape to continue sales to Britain after 1 January once thrice-delayed post-Brexit checks and controls are finally implemented. They had been due to come into force on 1 January 2021 but were pushed back to July, then to October and finally to January 2022, with a further set of controls due six months later in the coming July.  In another twist just before Christmas, the British government announced a carve out for the Republic of Ireland, saying the checks would be delayed for goods crossing the Irish Sea while talks over the Northern Ireland protocol continued. The British government is now confident there will be no further delays to the new controls on incoming goods, which will create a slew of old-school jobs in freight, customs and food standards not seen since the single market came into force in 1993. But what exactly is changing? What happens on 1 January 2022? Complicated paperwork will be required by the UK tax authorities for all imports from the EU. Traders will no longer be allowed to defer completion of customs declarations for Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC), a measure that was introduced to cope with the disruption of Brexit. How will this paperwork be submitted? Exporters will have to “pre-lodge” the paperwork with the correct authorities themselves or through an agent before their goods are loaded on to a ferry or train at Calais or other entry points. “While many UK hauliers are well prepared for this change, we suspect many EU hauliers are not,” said HMRC’s permanent secretary, Jim Harra. The carriers will be obliged to have records of the goods to allow HMRC to decide whether they will be free to go after arriving in Dover, Holyhead and other ports. The paperwork doesn’t stop there. Declarations in relation to the rules of origin must be completed to determine whether tariffs are applicable or not. EU suppliers of agri-food products into Britain will also have to pre-notify the authorities of any exports. What about 1 July 2022? The final set of controls on products of animal and plant origin will come into force on this date, with export health certificates and phytosanitary certificates required for all consignments. Physical checks will take place on arrival, although these are likely to be random or determined by intelligence about the cargo. Safety and security declarations on imports will also be required. Where will the checks take place? HMRC has had considerable difficulties organising the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) control posts. During the summer it confirmed that it was dramatically reducing in size a planned facility close to the famous White Cliffs of Dover, with most paperwork now expected to be checked at its Ashford lorry park instead. Dover Port Health Authority announced at the beginning of December it was to move to a new facility in the nearby village of Whitfield. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has confirmed this is one of three potential SPS sites. Another will open at Ashford and a third site in Kent is still to be identified, a spokesman said. Will it all go smoothly? By HMRC’s own calcuations, the number of customs declarations needing to be processed will rise from an estimated 48m a year to 250m now that they are required on goods arriving from all 27 EU states. Harra told the parliamentary public accounts committee in November that the “biggest risk” was lack of readiness among EU traders, especially small to medium sized companies. EU traders may experience the same kind of Brexit shock suffered by the Cheshire cheesemaker Simon Spurrell in January when he was left with a £250,000 hole in his export business as new requirements effectively closed down his retail sales to the continent. Harra said HMRC was writing monthly to 14,000 EU haulage firms to make sure they were ready, with information booklets on the new rules provided in multiple languages. Although the UK has been divorced from the EU for a year, the delays in applying import controls may have left some in the single market with the impression that they don’t exist. The added cost of administration could encourage some traders to quit the British market altogether. “Brexit red tape is an extreme interruption to what was otherwise a world-class logistics operation that was pin sharp,” said John McGrane, director general of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce. “Many businesses might argue the UK has had six years to prepare for this and why aren’t all these checks online?”",News/Politics,EU exporters to UK face a rude awakening as Brexit controls bite,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/29/eu-exporters-to-uk-face-a-rude-awakening-as-brexit-controls-bite
12/30/2021,"The number of patients in hospital with Covid is rising, but not all are admitted because of Covid. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals in England, has cautioned against overinterpreting hospital admissions data. “What our guys are saying is that incidental cases are about 25% to 30% of cases arriving … They are seeing an increase in the number of hospital admissions, but it’s not going up in an exponential way,” he said.  But just how many people are actually being hospitalised because of Covid, and how should the numbers be counted? What are the current figures for hospital admissions? The daily reported figure for Covid hospital admissions covers the total reported admissions to hospital and diagnoses while in hospital. According to data from NHS England, the figure is rising, at 1,374 on 26 December compared with 926 on 19 December – a 48% increase over seven days. Some reports suggest the majority of new hospital Covid patients are not “true cases”. Is that right? What is clear is that while numbers are increasing, admissions are not rising as fast as cases, even taking into account the time lags between infection and becoming severely ill. However hospital admissions data is not separated into those admitted with Covid or because of it. This means that getting a true handle on the proportion of hospital admissions because of Covid is tricky, but is it possible to gain some insights from the figures already available. The most recent available NHS England data reveals that on 26 December, there were 1,338 new hospital cases. Of these 1,082 were either admitted in previous 24 hours for the first time with Covid or were diagnosed in hospital in previous 24 hours where the test was within seven days of admission. In other words, 256 of the reported Covid hospital admissions – about 20% – were actually due to hospital-acquired infections, meaning the patients were originally admitted for different reasons. This approach does not take into account those already infected with Covid but admitted for other reasons. Dr David Strain, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school said in his experience the vast majority of Covid patients are admitted because of Covid rather than the infection being an incidental finding. And Hopson also suggested hospital bosses were reporting a figure of between 25 and 30%, so not the majority. Should we be reassured that so many people are being admitted with Covid, rather than because of it? Not really. Even those patients admitted ‘with’ rather than ‘because of’ Covid may only have required hospital care because of the disease itself. “We [have] seen many other people who have been otherwise stable [with] chronic diseases such as heart failure, ulcerative colitis etc that caught Covid and had a rapid deterioration. Although they are regarded as “incidental Covid”, this sudden deterioration in otherwise stable disease can be attributed to the virus,” said Strain, adding people who have Covid also have poorer outcomes after surgery. An alternative is to look at the total number of patients admitted, not just those with Covid, with Hopson noting some trusts have not seen an overall rise in admissions. However Strain said his experience is that overall unplanned admissions have risen. What’s more he said the approach has drawbacks. “The problem with looking at all admissions if the hospital is full, we don’t admit the surgical patients or people who we should be bringing in for elective procedures,” he said. Is there another way to look at the situation? As Hopson has noted, it is better to use numbers of Covid patients in hospital, rather than new Covid admissions, as the data is more up to date. It also gives a more accurate picture of the pressures on the health service. NHS England publishes a breakdown every week of the total number of Covid patients in hospital, together with the number who are being treated primarily for Covid. The latest data gives figures up to 21 December – new figures are expected in the coming days. The data shows that of the 6,245 Covid patients in acute trusts in England on 21 December, 4,432 – or over 70% – were being treated primarily for Covid. The remaining 30% of Covid patients in hospital were primarily being treated for another issue, however that does not necessarily mean they were not receiving some care for Covid as well. Dr Julian Tang, a professor of respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said that the proportion of people in hospital with Covid, rather than because of it, will vary a lot between different hospitals depending on factors including the local incidence of Covid. NHS data reveals the situation varies by region, with about 22% of Covid patients in hospital primarily being treated for another issue in the south-west on 21 December, compared with 39% in the Midlands. Should patients in hospital or admitted with Covid, not because of it, be discounted from the Covid data? Some have suggested including figures for patients with Covid is misleading as they may, for example, simply be receiving treatment for a broken leg. But Covid can lead to more disease in those admitted for another reason, longer hospital stays, more frequent readmissions or outpatient visits and even – in some cases – death. Patients with Covid also need to stay in Covid wards, putting pressure on bed numbers, and meaning elective surgery is postponed or cancelled. Covid patients also pose a risk of passing the infection to others, including other patients and staff. At present the NHS is hard hit by staff sickness and isolation due to Covid. “When it comes to burden on the healthcare system, we should absolutely not discount them,” said Strain.",News/World news,How can we measure the true scale of UK Covid hospital admissions?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/how-can-we-measure-the-true-scale-of-uk-covid-hospital-admissions
12/30/2021,"There has been another record rise in the number of daily Covid cases in the UK, with 183,037 reported on Wednesday. It is the first time since 24 December that data on daily case numbers has been made available for all four UK countries.  According to data released by the Scottish government, 15,849 people been reported to have tested positive for Covid in the last 24 hours, the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic, surpassing the previous record of 11,030 on 26 December. However the data comes with a warning that the figures include a backlog from before Christmas. The daily figure for England also broke records, with 138,287 cases reported on Wednesday compared with 117,093 on Tuesday. The figures refer to the number of cases by date reported, rather than by the specimen date, and reflect infections that are picked up through testing. Experts have noted it could be several days yet before the impact of infections caught over Christmas becomes apparent in the data. Reinfections are not included in the figures. Wednesday’s total for the UK surpasses the 138,831 cases reported the day before for Scotland, Wales and England combined – itself a record even with data for Northern Ireland missing – although the figure for Wales in Tuesday’s tally represented the combined number of cases that would have been reported on 25 and 26 December. A total of 22,972 new cases were reported for Northern Ireland on Wednesday – which included a five-day backlog over Christmas – while 5,929 cases were reported for Wales. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said “It is reasonable to assume that we will continue to see steep increases in cases in the days and indeed possibly in the weeks ahead”.",News/World news,"UK reports another record rise with more than 183,000 daily Covid cases",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/uk-reports-another-record-rise-in-covid-cases
12/30/2021,"For more than two decades, Unexport has shipped millions of kilograms of produce annually from farms in the southern Spanish region of Murcia to clients in the UK. Brexit has transformed the relatively straightforward process into a bureaucratic nightmare, yielding border waiting times of up to 10 hours for lorries laden with lemons and lettuce, said Domingo Llamas, its president. Given the damage already inflicted by the UK’s exit from the bloc, plus the coronavirus pandemic, he sees the final implementation of thrice-delayed checks as just “one other thing” to manage.  “The lorry that doesn’t have the document will be caught in the queue and those in behind will have to wait for them to move aside,” Llamas says. “At the end of the day, it might mean more time in the queue. “There’s just more and more bureaucracy. You need this document, this document isn’t completed properly, now go back to the queue and so on. Covid isn’t helping either.” Even when lorries arrive at the border with all the necessary documents, they risk being held up by less prepared hauliers. “If those in front of you don’t have their paperwork in order, everyone suffers the consequences as nobody can advance.” The constant threat of delays has left many drivers in Spain reluctant to take on UK-bound deliveries, pushing up the cost of the route and ultimately translating into higher prices for consumers, he said. “And any driver who isn’t very comfortable in English, they’ll have more problems. So there are many who have told their bosses that they don’t want to go to England, that they can be sent to other places but not England.” EU wine and beer exporters have already had to adapt to the checks, which the UK brought in for alcohol on 1 January 2021. However, further changes mean the sector still faces extra paperwork from the start of 2022. For many French winemakers, the UK is such an important market – in terms of size and prestige – that they have been preparing meticulously. “We anticipated this and have been preparing for a long time,” said Audrey Dokie, the logistics and sales administration manager at the Louis Moreau estate in Burgundy. The historic, family-run vineyard exports chablis around the world, but the UK is its biggest market. “We do know that next year it’s going to get much more difficult in terms of the extra details that will be required on each label,” said Dokie. “It’s going to be a more complex logistics operation and it won’t be easy, but we’ll go ahead and manage it. “Because we export worldwide, we’re used to adapting to rules, we have a flexibility. For much smaller winemakers it might be harder,” said Dokie. Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of Les Domaines Paul Mas vineyards in the Languedoc region, said: “Winemakers are generally well-versed in administrative constraints, so we’ll get through this and continue exporting. That said, there will be increased costs and the consumer might end up paying more.”",News/Politics,‘It won’t be easy’: the European exporters battling Brexit bureaucracy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/29/it-wont-be-easy-the-european-exporters-battling-brexit-bureaucracy
12/30/2021,"The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is investigating or observing 86 cruise ships with reported Covid-19 outbreaks on board as the pandemic is reaching a new peak in the United States with record numbers of infections. In addition to having already investigated 48 vessels, the agency has started investigating 38 ships, which according to its update, remain “under observation”.  Cruises leaving ports across the US resumed in June after being halted for over a year due to the pandemic. The agency regards cruise ships as hubs of contagion, especially as the more contagious Omicron variant spreads. “Cruise ships involve the movement of large numbers of people in settings where they are likely to have close contact with one another,” it said. “Cruise ships may also be a means by which infected persons travel between geographic locations,” it added. The CDC investigates a ship if the cases onboard are reported in 0.10% or more of passengers on restricted voyages, which typically have thousands of passengers and usually sail for five to 10 days. If a ship is carrying 6,500 passengers, it would require at least seven passenger-cases during the previous seven days to meet the agency’s investigation threshold. The CDC also investigates a crew-only ship if cases are reported in less than 1% of crew. The majority of the 86 cruise ships being investigated or monitored by the CDC belong to the largest three cruise operators: 32 of the ships are owned by Carnival, including its Holland America and Princess Cruises brands. Royal Caribbean owns 25 and Norwegian Cruise Line owns 15. In a tweet on Tuesday, Senator Richard Blumenthal criticized the resumption of cruises, saying: “Our warnings have proved sadly prescient & continuously compelling. Time for CDC & cruise lines to protect consumers & again pause – docking their ships. Cruises are repeating recent history as petri dishes of Covid infection.” Anne Madison, a spokesperson for the Cruise Lines International Association, reiterated the cruise industry’s cooperation with the CDC. “The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) and our members…continue to have very productive dialogue and are working together with the CDC in the interest of public health and safety,” she said. “Many of our members have announced additional measures in response to the Omicron variant, including strengthening testing, masking and other requirements, as well as encouraging booster vaccine doses for those eligible – and some cruise lines are requiring an additional test at embarkation,” she added.

An Ikea spokesperson tweeted: “Unfortunately, there has been a significant increase in costs across the supply chain, including in raw materials, transport and logistics. As this is still ongoing it is necessary to increase prices across many of our products.” Archived versions of Ikea’s website from as recently as October showed significant price increases, including a Malm desk that has gone up from £99 to £150, a jump of more than 50%. The price of a Hemnes daybed has gone up from £215 to £279, a 30% rise, while an Alex nine-drawer unit increased 35% from £85 to £115, according to archived versions of the Ikea website from earlier this year. A Kura children’s bed was up by 14% to from £129 to £150, while Ikea’s Klippan sofa, one of the Swedish store’s most popular items, is £20 more expensive – a rise of 11% – at £199. Ikea confirmed that the company had raised prices across multiple countries and ranges. A spokesperson said: “Since the start of the pandemic, Ikea has managed to absorb the significant cost increases experienced across the supply chain while keeping prices as low and stable as we possibly can. Now, like many other retailers, we have had to raise our prices to mitigate the impact on our business. “Price increases vary but remain in line with what we are seeing globally at Ikea, which is approximately a 9% average increase across countries and the product range.
