5/10/2022,"Russian forces are continuing their offensives in southern Ukraine and Donbas in the east, where fighting is taking place in villages across the region. Ukrainian officials said the Black Sea port of Odesa was hit by four cruise missiles fired from Crimea on Monday. More than 60 people were feared dead after a Russian bomb flattened a Ukrainian school being used as a shelter in Bilohorivka, an eastern village, Ukrainian officials said. Heavy fighting is still raging at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, as Russian forces attempt to finish off the city’s last-ditch defenders and complete the capture of the strategically vital port. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are holed up in the steel mill’s underground bunkers, many of them wounded. The remaining civilians were evacuated on Saturday. Video published by a Russia-backed separatist group on 4 May appears to show an attack on the plant. It is unclear when it was filmed: Footage published on 3 May showed smoke raising from the steelworks: Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/10/2022,"The pandemic turned the US into a next-day delivery nation. Amazon, in particular, saw sales surge during the dark days of Covid. In the first three months of 2021, the company watched its total sales tick up by 44%, constituting $8.1bn in profit. Those sales were led by the 200 million subscribers to Amazon’s super-fast delivery service Prime as people demanded everything from desk chairs to bananas delivered the next day. Amazon sold 44% more items during the pandemic, but the cost of fulfilling those orders increased by only 31%. This saving was one of scale – high-order volume allowed Amazon to operate even more efficiently. “It has run its warehouses closer to full capacity, and delivery drivers have made more stops on their routes, with less time driving between customers,” reported the New York Times. During that period of lockdowns, Amazon’s quick delivery became a lifeline for many people. But as we approach a return to a more normal life, many of us are investigating the various habits and proclivities we unconsciously established during Covid. Do we want to go back to the office? Are we satisfied with our current employment situation? And is the endless cycle of cardboard arriving at our doorsteps putting an undue strain on the planet, on our infrastructure, and on the human spirit? Amazon Prime ships about 1.6m packages a day. That operation is buoyed by a worldwide logistics team which rumbles all day and night. Isn’t that a little gluttonous? Or, as M Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, put it in an interview with NPR: “You don’t need a pair of socks to get to you swiftly. It probably makes just as much sense to get it to you efficiently.” For Amazon workers, this means working at an extraordinary pace. Jacob, who joined Amazon two years ago, says he has logged a total of 30,000 miles, and 400 routes. He is frequently saddled with shifts that force him to deliver to “70 separate three-story buildings” with more than 350 packages. “I was logging over 120 flights of stairs on my Fitbit,” he tells the Guardian. “Amazon constantly reminds us they put profits over their workers,” he says. “I ended up having a normal 200-plus stop day on Easter Sunday. Zero mercy shown.” The physical toll bears out in the data. According to a survey of workers in a Long Island Amazon warehouse, 42% reported physical pain in their day-to-day duties – usually in the feet and lower back. (They also noted psychological pressures and a deterioration of their normal sleep schedules.) “I do feel like the workload is unreasonable,” says another driver interviewed by the Guardian, who asked to remain anonymous. “There is no time to break. It is impossible to complete a route, and take your breaks, and be back to the station in time.” In the past eight years there have been hundreds of accidents involving Amazon vehicles, including at least six deaths, which were documented in BuzzFeed News investigation in 2019. But it is difficult to know the exact figures, given the way Amazon outsources its delivery apparatus to a worldwide network of companies. In total, BuzzFeed identified at least 250 outsourced dispatchers who work with Amazon. In many cities Amazon is promising packages in as little as five hours, or tells customers they can order by midnight and receive products the next morning. Would more time to make deliveries lead to a more equitable work environment? Jacob says an earlier cutoff for next-day delivery orders could give Amazon employees more time to breathe, but he also isn’t sure if customers would accept having to wait longer. “The standard has been raised,” he says. There are also questions about how sustainable this relentless pace is within the climate emergency. There are two differing philosophies about the emission impact of next-day delivery. Some argue that by streamlining the flow of products – bundling up all of our assorted consumption needs into parcels on a shared conveyor belt – we are taking the cars off the road that would previously be making routine trips to local strip malls. “The question is always, ‘What are we replacing?’” says Miguel Jaller, a professor at UC Davis and co-director of the Sustainable Freight Research program. “If you’re replacing a two-gallon-per-mile large SUV going every day to a store far away, then we’re benefiting the environment.” Amazon has claimed it will reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 (and has already made some strides in that arena – they remain the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy). But given the sheer diversity of items available on Amazon and other e-commerce retailers, experts say it becomes more difficult to assert that next-day delivery streamlines the supply chain. The average Prime order might constitute radically different items, which are both guaranteed to make it to your doorstep in 24 hours or less. “It gets harder to consolidate,” Anne Goodchild, a professor of engineering at the University of Washington, told Vox. “I think it’s easy to overlook how much travel we’re adding.” This is complicated further by Amazon’s reliance on contract labor, many of which use trucks that are considerably smaller than the giant 18-wheelers that haul fresh stock to bricks-and-mortar retailers, and generally carry a much heavier carbon footprint given their limited storage space. (In total, those vehicles are responsible for one0quarter of all carbon emissions in the transportation category.) In general, Jaller is unconvinced that the industry’s continued focus on speed above everything lends itself to a carbon-neutral model. “They started pushing one-day delivery and then they started pushing one-hour delivery. The faster you’re providing a service, the less likely you’re able to be [environmentally] efficient,” he says. Jaller does recommend a few remediesincluding a pivot to zero-emission vehicles. But generally speaking, experts believe that the path towards a sustainable, livable, non-exploitative future must begin with a shift in our social priorities. “It’s not a massive chunk of your total environmental impact, but every decision a consumer makes has some impact,” says Austin Whitman, CEO of the non-profit Climate Neutral, when I asked him if he believes next-day delivery can coexist within the ethical posture of any conscious shopper. “Should you put it on your list of the top 10 things to avoid? Absolutely.” Kai Lendwehr, the press officer of the environmental non-profit MyClimate, agrees. He advocates for a reorientation in the relentless parameters of consumption. Instead of searching for a supply-chain apparatus that sustainably satiates our demands, maybe we simply need to be wondering if we truly need the things we’re purchasing in the first place. “It’s about conscious buying,” he says. “Decide what you need, do some research, focus on quality, on things that make you feel suitable for a longer timeframe, and then click the green button. It shouldn’t really matter when the product arrives.”",News/Technology,"Exhausted workers, polluting journeys: how unethical is next-day delivery?",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/next-day-delivery-unethical-amazon-workers-pollution
5/10/2022,"A British man and his Filipina wife say they are facing imprisonment in Belarus and will miss out on starting a family via surrogacy because of UK delays in visa processing. Graeme Batsman, a data security expert from Harrow, and his wife, Maura Mendez Arganda, travelled to Vitebsk oblast, Belarus, in February to arrange a surrogate birth that would cost them £25,000. But they face losing that arrangement and their liberty, in a plight that exposes the human cost of visa processing problems in the UK. As their Belarus travel visa expires this week, they have been warned by local officials that they if they do not leave the country by Friday they will be imprisoned and fined. But they cannot leave because Arganda submitted her passport to the UK as part of a separate attempt to apply for a British visa that appears to be stuck in mounting backlog of cases. If the couple overstay their Belarus visa they face a five-year travel ban to Belarus, so they would miss out on a surrogacy arrangement that has already cost them $18,000 (£14,582) with a further $13,000 to pay when the baby is born. Speaking by phone from Belarus, Batsman said: “I’ve told the Foreign Office that I’m going to be calling them from a jail soon and they haven’t done anything.” He added: “If nothing is done, the UK government will be responsible for imprisoning us, a fine of perhaps €500 each, deportation and a travel ban. No one wants to stay in a jail and it will mean no baby for us.” Their dilemma emerged as evidence grew about the scale of problems caused by visa delays. More than 150 couples have complained to the BBC that they have also been hit by visa processing problems. Many have been waiting more than double the expected time for processing visas, the BBC reported. “It’s an admin issue – but that admin issue has now just stopped life,” Deon Barnard said as he and his wife wait for a spousal visa. Batsman said he had repeatedly called in vain for help from UK officials, ministers, and to a 69p-a-minute visa helpline. “I’ve emailed all sorts of ministers, everyone has been a jobsworth and has just passed us on. I have said to many people by email, or phone call, you will be responsible for endangering a British citizen and his Filipina wife.” Arganda first applied for a six-month visa to the UK in October last year. Despite 40 pages of supporting documents, supplied by Batsman, the application was refused on the basis that she had insufficient means. The couple got married in Odesa in January on a trip to Ukraine, where before the war more than 2,000 babies a year were born through surrogacy. As Russian troops massed on the border, the newlyweds abandoned their search for a surrogate mother in the country. After a failed search for surrogacy in Armenia, they then applied in February for a Belarusian visa with the sponsorship of a surrogacy clinic. Arganda applied for a UK visa again at the start of March, now as Batsman’s wife. The couple were told a decision was made on 7 April but they have received nothing since and her passport has not been returned. The Home Office has been approached for comment about Arganda’s case. It claims general visa delays have been caused by the situation in Ukraine. An official told the BBC: “We are prioritising Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine applications in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine, so applications for study, work and family visas have taken longer to process. We are working at pace to ensure these are issued as quickly as possible.”",News/UK news,Couple face Belarus prison and loss of surrogate child amid UK visa delays,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/couple-belarus-prison-surrogate-child-uk-visa-delays
5/10/2022,"Uefa will allow two clubs to enter the Champions League from 2024 based on historical performance, it has been agreed, but with the rankings determined by country and not club. The deal, struck at a meeting of Uefa’s executive committee on Tuesday, is a compromise which will also see the number of fixtures in the revamped Champions League reduced to eight matches per club in the ‘league stage’, down from a proposed 10. Under previous plans, two clubs who failed to reach the Champions League by league qualification would have still made the tournament based on their coefficient, a rating determined by performance in Europe over the previous five years. The new approach will also see two places determined by coefficient, but that of the country as a whole, and only over the past year. If the new rules were applied this season, the two extra places would go to clubs from England and the Netherlands. The numbers are based on points obtained by all a country’s clubs in a given season in the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League. In four of the past five seasons – and six of the past 10 – England would have got one of the places.

5/10/2022,"In a dank, disused railway tunnel in West Sussex hangs a brown, furry parcel, the sole known representative of Britain’s rarest mammal. Scientists don’t like to apply emotive adjectives to animals, but if ever there were a lonesome creature, it would be this greater mouse-eared bat. The bat’s reappearance in December for its 20th winter has astounded its guardians, because of the animal’s great age, but also because it was missing, assumed dead, for nearly two years. Since 2002, the bat – the size of a small rabbit, with a wingspan stretching in flight to nearly half a metre – has spent winters clinging to the cool bricks of the tunnel. But it vanished in December 2019 and was missing when members of Sussex Bat Group returned in January and February 2020. Last year, the pandemic prevented a count, so its fate was unknown. “We assumed it had run its course,” says Tony Hutson, a bat expert and retired entomologist from the Natural History Museum, who discovered the bat. “But it returned and looked pretty healthy this winter.” Where Britain’s rarest mammal spent the pandemic is just one question among many it poses. Each spring, the bat stirs, flaps slowly down the tunnel and vanishes into green woodlands beyond. It remains unseen until the following winter, when it returns to its hibernation roost. Where did it come from? Why is it here? Why is it alone? And can it be helped? When it was declared extinct in 1992, the greater mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis, was the first land mammal to disappear from Britain since the wolf, about 250 years ago. Most bats zigzag through the sky collecting insects, but this species descends earthwards, swooping upon grasshoppers, crickets and dung beetles. Often, it will flop on to the ground, wings outstretched to fold over its prey. There were never many of these bats in Britain. When a colony was discovered in 1957 in the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula in Dorset, it caused a sensation. Photos were published in the Times and several animals were prodded out of hibernation to be filmed in TV studios. Disturbing the bats mid‑hibernation probably killed some of them. Others were spirited away by collectors. The species was barely seen again. Hutson is not the original champion of Britain’s greater mouse-eared bats. The first was a tea planter from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) called William Watt Addison Phillips, who retired to Bognor Regis in West Sussex in 1959, shortly after the frenzy in Dorset. While exploring dilapidated tunnels with his grandson, Phillips discovered a small colony of the bats. He proceeded to shoot a couple for donation to the Natural History Museum. When Hutson discovered the bat in 2002, he hoped this young male would lead them to a secret colony. But a media appeal brought no sightings. He scoured chalk mines and disused lime kilns. An attempt to extract DNA from bat hair, to identify the individual’s origins, failed. He considered putting a VHF radio tag on the animal, but feared the imposition could kill it. In 2007, the bat was taken carefully from the wall for a short inspection. It was in good health, but very much alone: its genitals showed it had never been sexually active. In March 2018, I accompanied Hutson into the tunnel to meet Britain’s loneliest bat. It is difficult to bond with anyone who is deeply asleep, head tucked out of sight, but it was a small, tranquil being (and a paler brown than I had imagined). When the Irish playwright Barry McStay read the Guardian article I wrote about the bat, it inspired him to write Vespertilio, a play about Alan, a devoted conservationist guarding a rare bat. The middle-aged bat lover meets a young homeless runaway and the unfolding fiction explores loneliness within the gay community, love, deceit and redemption. The critically acclaimed play opened in London in 2019 in the apposite surroundings of a disused railway tunnel beneath Waterloo station. Later that year, the bat disappeared. Now that it has reappeared, there are calls to solve the riddle of its existence. “When it first turned up, I thought it was a pioneer and there were others around, but now I think it’s just a stray that got over here from the continent somehow and hung on,” says Hutson. The Sussex Bat Group volunteers have done all they can, but Fiona Mathews, a professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex, suggests professional conservationists should take action. She is calling on Natural England, the UK government’s adviser for the protection of nature, to investigate whether more greater mouse-eared bats are living undetected in Britain. Genetic identification of bat droppings found in large roof spaces where the species could roost could reveal individuals secreted away – in the roof of a stately home, for instance. “This individual bat is getting quite geriatric now. It’s a fascinating thing, but I keep turning over in my head what could be done. Why aren’t we doing more about this?” says Matthews. In mainland Europe, the species thrives around vineyards, which provide bare ground where it can easily find prey. Perhaps the proliferation of wine-making in Sussex could boost this impossibly uncommon bat in Britain. “Given that we think Britain is going to become more suitable for the species with climate change, why don’t we have a recovery programme for the greater mouse-eared bat?” asks Matthews. “We know this species is losing its range in southern Europe. They will probably need to move north for their survival. They are in northern France, which is not that different and not that far away. Maybe they just need a helping hand across the Channel.” Wild Green Wonders: A Life in Nature by Patrick Barkham is out now (Guardian Faber, £14.99).

5/10/2022,"We know that clingfilm and plastic ziplock bags are environmentally unfriendly, but what are the alternatives? What other storage options are worth investing in?Jane, London N4 “You’ve got to have zero tolerance for everything to do with plastic, whether that’s in the house or what’s coming into the house,” says chef Ollie Hunter, who runs The Wheatsheaf, a sustainable pub in Wiltshire. But when it comes to eco-friendly replacements, it’s worth remembering that new isn’t always better: “I’m a purist,” says Hunter. “Let’s just reuse what we’ve already taken out of the planet.” He suggests getting into “the mindset of a bowl and a plate” – simple, yes, but achievable and affordable. This is also a favoured storage tactic of Anshu Ahuja and Renée Williams, co-founders of DabbaDrop in London, a vegan curry takeaway that delivers by bike in eco-packaging. “If it’s a lemon, for example, just put it [or an onion, red cabbage, tomato … you get the drift] sliced side down on a plate, and voilà! No bag or clingfilm needed.” If you’re storing something “wetter, crumbly, or a mixture” instead, use a deep bowl covered by a plate. “And if you need to wrap lettuce, just use a clean tea towel.” A tea towel can, of course, also be used when proving dough, and a damp one for wrapping things like pastry. Bowl covers (those things that look like shower caps) are another way to avoid clingfilm – just make sure they’re made of linen, Hunter says, because “it’s less water-intensive and easier to grow than cotton, and it does seem to be better, as long as you like the crinkled look”. Hunter is, however, “a big negative” when it comes to those reusable beeswax wraps. “Bees need to be left alone,” he insists. Soy wax versions are another option: “Plants and vegetables create better soil structure, more biodiversity, more oxygen in the planet. Bees aren’t going to be doing that.” Likewise, silicone – be it bags or boxes for the fridge and freezer or baking sheets – is better than plastic, Hunter says, but is “a harder thing to get back to its natural state”. Bamboo and wood are also good choices, as is metal, for fridge and freezer, and for Ahuja and Williams’ beloved dabbas. “They’re made from food-grade stainless steel and can carry lunch or store leftovers in separate compartments.” You can pop them in the fridge or oven, and they’re good for picnics, too – “We don’t use anything else.” Jars, meanwhile, are of course good for storing everything from dressings to grains, and come with the bonus of looking good, too. But, says Jake Leach, head chef at The Harwood Arms, the only Michelin-starred pub in London, use only whatever you have to hand. “There’s always takeaway boxes, butter tubs, bottles … most things can be reused.” Essentially, don’t buy it if you don’t need it. “We need to preserve, conserve and protect,” Hunter says.

5/10/2022,"The head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has warned that the civilian death toll in Ukraine may be thousands higher than the official toll of 3,381, with deaths in the port city of Mariupol alone likely to add significantly to the total. “We have been working on estimates, but all I can say for now is that it is thousands higher than the numbers we have currently given to you,” Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, told a press briefing in Geneva, when asked about the total number of deaths and injuries. “The big black hole is really Mariupol, where it has been difficult for us to fully access and to get fully corroborated information,” she said. The warning was delivered as dozens more bodies were discovered in the ruins of a burnt out and collapsed five-storey building in Izium in the Kharkiv region, and as the UN migration agency said 8 million people were internally displaced inside Ukraine by the conflict. “This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population!” Oleh Synehubov, the head of Kharkiv’s regional administration, said in a social media message announcing the deaths. As both Ukrainian and Russian military officials claimed advances in the battles for the country’s south and east, dominated by a 300-mile-long frontline, the latest phase of the campaign appeared to have settled for now into a grim back and forth struggle over shell smashed villages and small towns. In the Kharkiv area in particular, the conflict has turned into a long-range shelling war between the two sides. After unexpectedly fierce resistance forced the Kremlin to abandon its effort to storm Kyiv more than a month ago, Moscow’s forces have concentrated on capturing the Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial region. Further west, Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles, after Russia marked its biggest patriotic holiday without giving new information about the war. One person was killed and five were wounded, the military said. As part of the barrage, a Russian supersonic bomber fired three hypersonic missiles, according to the Center for Defence Strategies, a Ukrainian thinktank tracking the war. The centre identified the weapons used as Kinzhal – or “Dagger” – hypersonic air-to-surface missiles although there was no independent verification of what missiles were used. The strikes on Odesa come amid warnings from the Ukrainian military’s general staff of an elevated missile threat across the country, including claims Russia has increased the number of naval missile carriers operating in the Black Sea. With the conflict on both sides being defined by intense Russian shelling by artillery and rocket systems, CNN quoted an unnamed defence official on Monday saying the Ukraine military had received 85 of 90 M777 long-range field howitzers promised by the US, along with 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition out of 184,000 promised. The defence official said the US military in Europe completed the training of 310 Ukrainian service personnel in handling howitzers with a further 50 undergoing training. In Mariupol itself, fierce fighting was continuing around the area of the Azovstal steel mill where about 2,000 Ukrainian defenders are still holding out. Despite claims that all civilians who had been sheltering there had been evacuated, it was claimed on Tuesday about 100 were still inside the sprawling plant. One of the Ukrainian fighters holding out at the steel plant said they were still defending the city. Valeri Paditel, who heads the border guards in the Donetsk region, said the fighters were “doing everything to make those who defend the city in the future proud”. While assessments by western defence and intelligence officials, as well as military analysts have focused on the shortcomings of the Russian operation and the heavy losses of men and equipment sustained, there was little evidence of an end in sight for Moscow’s campaign. “Without concrete steps to build a new force, Russia can’t fight a long war, and the clock starts ticking on the failure of their army in Ukraine,” said Phillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews.

5/10/2022,"The state opening of parliament is a reminder that much of what passes for a British constitution is actually fancy dress. The doors to the Commons are ritually closed on Black Rod, the royal emissary, as a reminder that monarchs have not been allowed in the chamber since 1642, when King Charles I burst in to demand the arrest of rebellious members. Civil war followed. Fast-forward 380 years and we find another Charles on the golden throne of the House of Lords – sitting in for his elderly mother – dictating parliament’s agenda from a goatskin parchment. The speech is written in Downing Street, where a prime minister in command of a large Commons majority enjoys powers not much diluted down from monarchy. There are two forces determining how Boris Johnson uses that power. Both are informal and temperamental. First, he is afraid to upset ideological sensibilities on the right of his party, where a taste for rebellion is always quick to turn regicidal. Second, he takes no interest in the managerial side of government – the business of getting things done – which he finds boring. As for restraint on abuses of power, the conventional mechanism is conscience. There are invisible lines that a prime minister is expected not to cross as a point of honour, guided by natural deference to democracy. It is well-established now that those qualities are absent in Johnson. Taken in combination, those factors produce a legislative agenda that is not really about governing at all but sending signals, framing debates and skewing the pitch on which the prime minister intends one day to campaign for re-election. The volume of bills being proposed, 38 in all, testifies to a lack of focus and purpose. In the absence of one big plan, there are many little plans to look busy. None of it comes close to getting a grip on the single biggest issue facing most people in the country: the shrivelling of their incomes as prices rise against a backdrop of impending recession. The Johnson flagship policy for the general betterment of life in the UK will be enacted as a “levelling up and regeneration bill”. Its advertised benefits are formidable. A government briefing note promises, among other treats, to “improve productivity, boost economic growth, encourage innovation, create good jobs and enhance educational attainment”. Scroll down to find the method, and it turns out that Shangri-la is reached by way of measures no less drastic than “giving residents more of a say over changing street names and ensuring everyone can continue to benefit from alfresco dining”. There will also be a new duty on the government to set “levelling up missions” and report on whether they have been accomplished. The law to make everything better for everyone will work by placing a statutory obligation on the government to explain how things are getting better. Johnson is reduced to these inanities because the most powerful faction among his MPs will not, as a point of ideological principle, countenance anything that seriously interferes with the accrual of wealth and privilege to those who already have them. Levelling up has hit the same obstacle that derailed David Cameron’s “big society” agenda. That too was conceived as a way to rehabilitate unhappy parts of the country without recourse to any of the explicit financial redistribution that Thatcherite Tories despise as socialism. Johnson, like Cameron before him, has wasted time on delusions of political alchemy, trying to cook up egalitarian ends with libertarian means. The product will always disappoint. The next stage is also predictable. Someone will have to be blamed for the persistence of material discomfort, and the political subject will have to be steered away from the economy. That leaves Johnson committed to a programme of government by campaign gesture and culture war provocation. Downing Street has laws for both. One item, long anticipated on the Tory benches, will be a “bill of rights”, the purpose of which is to assert British national autonomy in matters of human rights law, in much the same spirit that Brexit was imagined as a heroic economic emancipation. In place of legal obligation to principles enshrined in international treaty, enforceable by courts, there will be a restoration of “common sense”, as defined by ministers. In Orwellian fashion, this is cast as a measure to “ensure the constitution is defended”; from what that defence is needed is unclear. The implied enemy is quisling remainer judges, always getting their wigs in a twist over government breaking the rules, and lefty human rights lawyers, one of whom happens to be leader of the Labour party. In the same spirit, there will be a public order bill, banning direct action protests – climate activists chaining themselves to railings, gluing themselves to motorways – that cause a nuisance but hardly threaten to unravel society. Police will be given powers to stop anyone who even looks as if they might be up to anti-government mischief. As with immigration policy, Downing Street is convinced that public opinion on law and order permits strides to the authoritarian right well beyond the boundaries of conventional Westminster consensus. The rule of thumb: if liberals are squealing in distress, double down; press harder. It seems a long time ago that moderate Tory MPs were endorsing Johnson for the leadership in the belief that his true colours were the ones he had displayed to win election as mayor of London. They thought that the cosmopolitan incarnation of “Boris” would re-emerge once Brexit was done. Johnson himself promised them as much in private têtes-à-têtes, although they should have known he was promising the opposite to Eurosceptic headbangers in a room next door. It was clear then that Johnson would say anything to become prime minister and, once that goal was achieved, do anything with the power at his disposal to carry on being prime minister. That is all there is and all there ever was. That is the agenda that Prince Charles declared from his mother’s throne, albeit encrypted in parliamentary pageant. And this is all that will be left once the crowns, robes and rods have been packed safely back in the constitutional dressing-up box: 38 bills adding up to a campaign for the deferral of serious government and the prolongation of rule by Johnson for Johnson’s sake.

5/10/2022,"The chief executive of Stellantis, one of the world’s biggest carmakers, has warned battery shortages could affect the industry as soon as 2025 as the transition towards electric vehicles accelerates. Carlos Tavares, the Stellantis chief executive, said that current plans for battery production may not address the demand from carmakers as they ramp up electric car sales in the coming years, even with significant new investments in European “gigafactory” battery plants and suppliers already at scale in China, South Korea and Japan. The car industry has struggled with persistent shortages of computer chips since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, preventing it from making a full recovery. Despite strong demand in many big markets, shortages of crucial parts have meant the industry has lost out on billions of pounds in sales. Tavares warned that battery supply could be the next bottleneck facing the industry, just as carmakers around the world try to accelerate production of electric vehicles. Stellantis, which owns brands including Peugeot, Vauxhall, Fiat, Chrysler and Jeep after a merger last year, is aiming to sell only battery EVs in Europe by 2030. “I can anticipate that we will have around 2025, 2026, a short supply of batteries, and if there is no short supply of batteries then there will be a significant dependence of the western world vis-a-vis Asia,” he said, speaking on Tuesday at a car industry conference run by the Financial Times. “That’s something that we can easily anticipate. “The speed at which everybody is building manufacturing capacity for batteries is possibly on the edge to be able to support the fast-changing markets in which we are operating.” Stellantis and its predecessor Peugeot under Tavares were among the more cautious large-scale carmakers in embracing electric technology. Tavares has repeatedly warned of problems in the transition away from polluting fossil fuel vehicles. Last year he said the UK government had risked the future of Vauxhall’s factory in Ellesmere Port with a “brutal” ban on sales of pure internal combustion engines after 2030, although Stellantis later decided to invest £100m to upgrade production, to the relief of the UK car industry. Tavares also warned that the shift to electric production could create “geopolitical risks” because of dependence on minerals mined in countries seen as strategic rivals. “We may not like the way that those materials are going to be sourced in a few years,” he said.",News/Business,"Electric car battery shortage looms in 2025, warns Stellantis boss",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/electric-car-battery-shortage-looms-in-2025-warns-stellantis-boss
5/10/2022,"Vikings, history tells us, loved a party and would almost certainly have drunk plentiful amounts of beer and mead if there was an axe-throwing contest. Whether their 2022 imitators should follow suit is another question. Councillors in York will next week have to decide whether customers at an axe-throwing centre in the city should be allowed to consume alcohol during sessions. Police and council officials are against the idea, citing the “risk of harm to staff and other customers”. Urban axe throwing has become hugely popular in recent years with venues opening up across the UK. The Guardian’s Rhik Samadder, describing the experience, said “basically it’s darts, with axes”, with participants coached to throw axes at a wooden board where a bullseye wins the most points. Owners of the Hilt in York, which offers “axe throwing for aspiring Vikings”, have applied to the city council for a relaxation in its licence that would allow it to serve a limit of two alcoholic drinks for each customer during a session. The two drinks would not be spirits. “Alcohol will not be sold to any customer suspected of being intoxicated,” the application states. It adds: “There will be a one or two drink limit depending on how many drinks have been purchased with the booking. This way axe throwers will not be able to consume enough to reach any dangerous level of intoxication in the 75 minutes of their session.” That assertion is questioned in the police objection to councillors. “This is a very bold statement to make,” Sgt Jackie Booth said. “What is the applicant classing as a ‘dangerous level’?” Police say the venue has no way of knowing if someone has been drinking already and that allowing further alcohol before and during throwing increases “the risk of an incident taking place involving an axe which is a weapon whether sharp or blunt”. The applicant, Hilt Adventures, says axe-throwing venues are becoming more and more common “and some of our competitors have recently managed to obtain a crucial edge over us” by customers being able to have a drink while they throw an axe. It adds: “The Hilt has a perfect record for safety, operating since September 2019 without a single accident.” Booth said she held a video call with the applicant where she pointed out the only other axe-throwing venue in the area had the same alcohol conditions. Councillor’s on York council’s licensing subcommittee will decide the matter next Monday.",News/UK news,York council to rule on whether to allow alcohol at axe-throwing centre,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/york-council-rule-on-whether-allow-alcohol-axe-throwing-centre
