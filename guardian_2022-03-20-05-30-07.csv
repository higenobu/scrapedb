3/20/2022,"Two sleepless days after Eduard Lysovysk was carried into a basement bomb shelter, his thigh bone shattered by a Russian sniper’s bullet, soldiers from the army who had shot him came to visit. Heavy shelling outside had pinned him and dozens of neighbours into the cramped dugout, where he would spend a week in agony, waiting for a chance to flee the neighbourhood he once called home. The Russian soldiers stood over the man they had injured, his leg tied up with bandages torn from bedsheets and held in place with a makeshift splint, and told Lysovysk: “We have come to protect you.” Lysovysk’s wife, Iryna, undaunted by the guns, asked them: “Protect us from what? From our own homes?” Lysovysk had been shot as he evacuated her and an elderly neighbour from their apartment building across the balconies, after CCTV showed Russian soldiers in the hallway. The single round slammed into his leg as he stood at the edge of a crowd by a bomb shelter door, after the second evacuation trip. No other shots were fired towards the group, and no one else was hurt. After Lysovysk spent a day of agony, without painkillers or antibiotics, his wife went to ask the Russian soldiers for help. “We said we have injured, and need things like blankets and duvets,” she told the Observer. They let her briefly back into the couple’s flat, which had lost its door and was filled with 10 Russian officers, then sent round the medic, who changed Lysovysk’s bandages, gave him a single dose of antibiotics, and left. There was no offer of further medical treatment or evacuation, and by day five after the shooting, Lysovysk was running a fever. Iryna went out again to seek another round of medicine. “It felt awful, because they were on our territory and they got to feel like they were helping us but I had no other choice but to ask,” she said. During that long ordeal, the pain of his shattered leg was relieved only by the courage and generosity of neighbours who risked shelling and gunfire to go and comb their apartments for painkillers to share. The Lysovysks and their neighbours were plunged into the most intense horror of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from the start of the war, by an accident of geography. They lived in Hostomel, a Kyiv dormitory town beside a cargo airbase of the same name, which Russia tried to seize from the first night of the war, and fought over for days. Chechen troops known for their ruthlessness were part of the mission, launched so rapidly that residents barely had time to even consider escaping, before the full fury of battle swept through their town. In the week before his injury, Lysovysk witnessed and captured in photos and videos the atrocities unfolding around him. His images and testimony together form a powerful, and unusually comprehensive diary of those bloody days in an area now under Russian control. They also provide important visual evidence of crimes which have been widely reported, but less frequently preserved on video or in photos, because of fear and Russian confiscation of phones. This includes the shooting of civilians as they tried to escape. On 25 February, a day after the invasion began, he noticed a car outside his apartment block with shattered windows, its radiator leaking on to the ground. He went to check it out and realised the bullets had also found a human target inside. An 18-year-old boy was slumped in the passenger seat. Another neighbour, who arrived first at the scene, said his grandmother was trying to drive them both to safety. He had been hit in the eye; she had kept going for nearly two miles after being shot, trying to reach a village outside town – perhaps in shock, or in vain hope of reaching medics. An ambulance had taken her to hospital, but it was too late for the young man. Even so early in the war, medics had no space in their vehicles for the dead, so the body was left behind for burial. In the violent days that followed, Lysovysk, a former construction worker, continued to document how the war was unfolding around him. Refugees escaping occupied areas have repeatedly described Russian soldiers shooting at their cars, even when marked with white flags or carrying signs saying “children”, and seeing abandoned vehicles with bodies inside. One video he took from a motorway outside town captures apparent evidence of a massacre. Seven civilian cars, riddled with bullet holes, have been abandoned beside the road. In one dark red Lada, keys still lie on the bloodstained seats, although all the dead or injured occupants had been taken away. As the battle worsened, food supplies began to run out. Eduard filmed workers from the office of mayor Yuriy Prylypko giving jars of vegetables, potatoes and other food to trapped residents, and asked why they were not distributing guns instead so that residents could fight. “They told me the Russians had taken over the national guard base inside Hostomel where all the guns were stored, and so there were no weapons to give out.” Five days later, Prylypko was shot dead by the invaders while handing out bread to civilians. On 3 March, Russian tanks rolled into town and soldiers began setting up base in a construction site near the Lysovysks’ home. That night they moved into the apartment block. Screenshots from CCTV show men in military camouflage milling in the hallway, and the couple saw the group place something outside their door, which they feared was a trip wire. Their home was on the ground floor, so they decided to climb over their balconies the next morning to escape to a bomb shelter across the street. When daylight returned, Lysovysk first helped his 59-year-old wife over to the bomb shelter, and went back for an elderly neighbour on the same floor. With both rescues complete, he took a moment outside the shelter to make a phone call, and as he stood still the sniper pulled his trigger. “It hit me, and my leg just collapsed out to the side. It looked like I had two knees,” said Lysovysk, speaking from his hospital bed in Bila Tservka, a city south of Kyiv that has been spared intense fighting. He was taken there for treatment because his injuries are so complex and doctors say he will need multiple surgery to regain use of his leg; the bone was shattered. “He shouted and fell,” said Iryna Lysovysk, who was standing beside him. “We only just managed to drag him into the shelter.” The crowd inside helped rip up sheets to make a tourniquet and dress the wound. He later bound it with a makeshift splint, to keep the leg straight, and the couple sent messages to friends, asking for an ambulance because they couldn’t get through to emergency services. Then they turned their mobiles off and hid them behind jars of pickled vegetables, after they were warned by people in the basement that the Russians had been confiscating people’s phones. “They took some people’s phones and in other cases, just ripped the sim cards out,” Iryna Lysovysk said. When the Russian soldiers came, Lysovysk was lying on the floor, clearly immobile and in terrible pain, but the men kept their fingers on their triggers. “It was like they were afraid of me,” he said. “They said ‘it wasn’t us who shot you, it was a Ukrainian sniper’, but I said “Tell me where they are?” In over a week of fighting the Lysovsks had only once seen a small detachment of six soldiers in Ukrainian uniform. “I had seen the (Russian) sniper eye to eye, 20m away from us, he was in the next apartment block over, the construction block.” On 9 March, two days after the mayor was shot, Hostomel’s residents were finally told they could evacuate through a humanitarian corridor; most went on foot to a collection point. But Lysovysk couldn’t walk and needed to lie flat, and in the rush to escape the terrifying basement shelters and the constant thud of shells and rockets, no one with a car could make room for him. The next day, they used cardboard to patch the windows of a neighbour’s bombed-out minibus, and laid him on the floor, the beginning of his long journey to recovery. But when they made it to safety, the couple found one final, devastating stroke of Russian cruelty; the troops hadn’t only denied Lysovysk medical care from their own doctors, they also blocked Ukrainian help. Relatives had called an ambulance on the day he was shot, and it had got 300 metres from his shelter when Russians turned it back. “If we had only known,” said Iryna Lysovysk, staring at her injured husband, who could have been spared most of his terrible ordeal. “We would have carried him there ourselves.”",News/World news,"‘We have to come to protect you,’ Russian soldiers told Ukrainian man they’d shot",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/we-have-to-come-to-protect-you-russian-soldiers-told-ukrainian-man-theyd-shot
3/20/2022,"“Losing to Madrid hurts but we’re closer to winning,” Gerard Piqué said at the end of the last clásico. It was a curious kind of consolation after yet another defeat knocked Barcelona out of the Spanish Super Cup, but this time there was something for them to cling to. That, at least, was the hope and since then it has hardened into something more tangible. The 282nd meeting between these clubs may offer an indication of how much closer they have come or how far they still have to travel. Fifteen points behind, it is too late for Barcelona to win the league, the title in Madrid’s hands with weeks to spare, but maybe the clásico can become a proper contest again. Not so much on Sunday night, although that too, but beyond. In that last meeting in January, Barcelona were beaten 3-2 in Saudi Arabia. The outcome was depressingly familiar for them, but at least it hadn’t been a drubbing: it had taken a 99th-minute goal from Fede Valverde to defeat them and at the point they had started to take control. “Playing like this we’ll compete for titles,” Piqué said, while the Catalan daily El Mundo Deportivo led its front page on “They fall with honour”. Inside it declared “Barcelona are not completely back, but almost.” Xavi Hernández, appointed two months earlier, said: “We were the better team in play and dominating the game. If you toss a coin and it comes out heads, no one complains, but it came out tails. This could have been a turning point in terms of the result, but it [still] is in terms of play.” Some laughed at them. A lot laughed, in fact. Barcelona had been overrun in the first half and the bottom line was inescapable: they had still lost. That made it five clásicos in a row. They stood accused of celebrating defeat, the way they clung to an empty moral victory a humiliation in itself: how the mighty have fallen. But that was pretty much the point. Many expected a destruction but Barcelona had competed, offering some hope, some football. And soon talk of a turning point didn’t look so misplaced. In the next game, Barcelona were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Athletic Bilbao. But the winter window closed with Dani Alves, Ferran Torres, Adama Traoré and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joining. Ousmane Dembélé had not departed, Xavi soon making a virtue of that failure. The coach’s vision was becoming ever more apparent, an identity emerging, an entire shift in culture discernible. Something was building, the only criticism of Xavi’s appointment now that it hadn’t come sooner. When he reached his 100th day in charge, Xavi said it felt “like 100 years” and last week he said there is too much going on in his head to be able to enjoy this. But he admits it’s getting better, a little better all the time. The last clásico showed it could, and since defeat at Athletic, Barcelona have gone 11 without losing. The team for whom European away games have been an almost endless trauma have won in Napoli and Istanbul, reaching the Europa League quarter-finals. They put four past Atlético Madrid; they have scored four goals five times in 10 games and climbed back into a Champions League place for the first time this season. Sunday’s points matter: victory would mean taking second from Sevilla remains in their own hands; lose and Atlético and Betis could overtake while Real Sociedad could move to within a point. Reality remains. On Friday, these clubs watched different European draws: Madrid awaited opponents in the Champions League, Barcelona in the Europa League. On Monday, they were confronted by different financial realities too when La Liga published salary limits: Madrid’s is €739m, Barcelona’s minus €144m. Much as Joan Laporta, Barcelona’s bullish president, said they would try to win the league, they accept they cannot. Not this year, at least. There is an assuredness about Madrid that makes them formidable opponents, and time has run out, the gap too great. But next year and the years beyond that no longer look so bleak for Barcelona; they certainly will not if they can end that run against Madrid, the ultimate measure of where they are, a sign they can build for better days. This league has gone, but others needn’t do the same. Besides, the clásico always has a meaning beyond the maths. Carlo Ancelotti was asked how his team could possibly lose the league now that they had moved 10 points clear with 10 games to go. “How can you lose a European Cup final when you’re 3-0 up?” the manager of Milan in 2005 replied. He knows, and so does Xavi. Yet the Barcelona manager’s response to a similar question contained an idea that can at least be entertained now, the hope of a clásico that is competitive again. “We can’t be very optimistic about the league: Real Madrid would have to lose three or four and they haven’t all season,” he said. “Quite honestly, It’s very difficult – even if we win at the Bernabéu.”",Sport/Football,El Clásico: Xavi’s Barça head to Real Madrid with unexpected optimism,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/el-clasico-xavi-barcelona-head-to-real-madrid-with-unexpected-optimism
3/20/2022,"Every year the question is asked: what is the point of the FA Cup, why should we care? This is not the Premier League, with its slick production values, glamorous stars at every turn and sense of dramatic urgency. There’s no great sense that it matters: you lose, you’re out and it has no bearing on the race for fourth. You win the thing and your manager still gets sacked a few days or weeks or months later – between 2012 and 2018, Arsène Wenger was the only FA Cup-winning manager still to be in his job a year later. Yet it remains a tremendously democratic institution and, amid everything else – the landmark final, the money it diverts down the pyramid, the chance it offers smaller clubs for a day to mark indelibly in their history (the time we won at Burnley, the afternoon we drew with West Ham, the night we played at Everton …), it offers a reminder of games that used to be. And for fans of a certain age, disillusioned by the transformation of clubs into commercial vehicles or tools of soft power, nostalgia may be the most important thing we have left: it’s the only thing to look forward to – the past. It was 44 years ago on Tuesday that Nottingham Forest claimed their first major trophy of the Brian Clough era, winning a League Cup final replay against Liverpool, the team they face in an FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday night. Getting to a replay had been a matter of some fortune. Forest were without three cup-tied players, including Peter Shilton, which meant a start in goal for Chris Woods who, at 18 years and 124 days, remains the youngest goalkeeper to play in a Wembley final. With Colin Barrett injured and John McGovern struggling through with a tight groin, Liverpool dominated but were thwarted by the brilliance of Woods. “He kept his cool,” wrote John Lawson in the Nottingham Evening Post, “revealed the immense natural talent that he possesses and stole the hearts of a Wembley crowd as well as headline acclaim.” Before the replay at Old Trafford, Clough’s assistant, Peter Taylor, took the squad to Scarborough, ostensibly to relax them, although the trip served a useful secondary function in helping him move some furniture up to an apartment he had bought there. Unorthodox, perhaps, but it stressed that Forest were outsiders, that they did things differently, that they were rebels against the establishment. Clough was somebody who always scorned tactical discussion, but it is remarkable how often at key moments he or Taylor would make a significant tweak. McGovern’s groin was too sore to be risked and so he was replaced by John O’Hare. That pushed John Robertson into a deeper role, giving Forest a more compact shape that helped cut off the supply to Kenny Dalglish, a cautious, patient approach that would offer the blueprint for the European success to come. Woods made early saves from Phil Neal and Dalglish and Alan Kennedy had an effort ruled out for handball before Robertson got the only goal with a 53rd-minute penalty after Phil Thompson had tripped O’Hare. It was, Thompson admitted, “a professional foul”, and today it would be a clear red card, but Liverpool were furious. “I knew he was outside the area when I kicked him,” Thompson said, while Tommy Smith dismissed the performance of the referee, Pat Partridge, as “bloody ridiculous” and suggested he “should be shot”. The temptation is to see all this as another world, a knockabout place without VAR when nobody had heard the phrase “denying a goalscoring opportunity”, when players acted as removal men and frustrated defenders could call for the assassination of referees without fearing some social media warrior might take them seriously, when Nottingham Forest could be a major club. But the modern game was beginning to emerge. As early as 1969, Maurice Edwards had written in the Derby Evening Telegraph of “a super league within Division 1” that was beginning to pull away from the rest. There were no funds – hedge, sovereign wealth or public investment – and no oligarchs, but there was an awareness that as football’s popularity grew and, thanks to Match of the Day and England’s World Cup win, it became mass public entertainment, there was a risk that a self-perpetuating elite would emerge. Edwards was right. He named Liverpool, Leeds “and others”. If you assume by that he meant Arsenal, Everton and Manchester United, 30 of the next 35 league titles would be won by that five-team elite before Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea broke the sequence. Of the other five, one was won by Aston Villa, in 1969 still the joint-third most successful side in English history; one by a Blackburn fuelled by the millions of Jack Walker; two by Derby, once under Clough and once in effect by the team he had left behind; and one by Forest. Clough’s genius held off almost single-handed the emergence of an elite group of super-clubs for a decade. Forest had no wealthy backers. In 1977, they were run by a committee headed by the chairman, Brian Appleby, a lawyer, and his deputy, Stuart Dryden, a sub-postmaster. Forest were constantly short of cash, which led to the gamble in 1979-80 on building the Executive Stand at a cost of £2.5m. When the signings of Justin Fashanu, Peter Ward and Ian Wallace didn’t work out, the repayments proved a crippling burden. The decline of Forest from European champions to top-six challengers in the 80s tends to be put down to Clough’s falling out with Taylor, and that clearly was a major factor, but so, too, were basic issues of finance. Of course mistakes have been made, some of them major, and, of course, things might have been different had different decisions been taken, but Forest’s post-Clough decline has essentially returned them to the status they held before he took over. Their improvement under Steve Cooper has brought FA Cup wins over Arsenal and Leicester, already created memories that will be treasured by this generation, but Sunday is the reminder of another time, that more innocent age when one extraordinary manager could still hold back the tides of economic history.",Sport/Football,Forest v Liverpool FA Cup tie offers reminder of another time in Clough era  | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/19/fa-cup-tie-offers-reminder-of-another-time-with-nottingham-forests-clough-era-liverpool
3/20/2022,"Aquestion: when will a Manchester City No 9 truly be a No 9 and not a false one, as when Pep Guardiola fields Bernardo Silva, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish, or Gabriel Jesus to “lead” the line? Answer: when Erling Haaland or another recognised centre-forward targeted by the manager is signed in the summer. Those named above in Guardiola’s current squad operate as the supposed lone striker, but in his carousel of revolving positions any attack-minded player is informed to float into an advanced central berth and dizzy opponents. In this mode City are the piquant entertainers who claimed last term’s Premier League with no natural No 9 for most of the campaign and whose title defence this season will not feature one at all. City are the leaders, by a point from Liverpool, with nine matches left. They are at Southampton on Sunday in the FA Cup quarter-finals and were drawn against Atlético Madrid on Friday in the Champions League last eight as they chase a Treble he believes is possible if particularly tough to achieve. Yet Guardiola’s striker-less wonders still require an elite one, he insists, so when the next window opens the club will resume a chase that failed last summer to land Harry Kane. The new head of the list is Haaland. After Monday’s stumble at Crystal Palace – 0-0, chances spurned – Guardiola can expect a) to be posed more questions about the Borussia Dortmund man; and b) to hear from the told-you-so brigade about how trying to be champions again with no 20-goal-a-season marksman was always going to be folly. Guardiola, a shrewd operator, has already preempted these scenarios, saying he gets “killed” for the latter whenever points are dropped and, regarding the former, via a mantra heard in several media briefings that “Manchester City definitely need a striker”. This is a novel discourse for a manager who adores a midfielder. To hear Guardiola, an accomplished No 6 from the Barcelona school of schemers, be so unequivocal regarding the desire for a prolific scorer can jar. Then there is the empirical evidence the table shows: City are first, their 68 goals ranking second only to Liverpool who also lack a consistently scoring No 9. Roberto Firmino is the regular there but the Brazilian’s league returns are 12, nine and nine in the past three seasons, with five after 16 appearances this term (though he has been injured). They do, though, have Mo Salah – the Golden Boot winner of 2016-17, who registered 22, 19 and 22 in the following campaigns and has 20 in this – plus the support acts of Sadio Mané (12 this season, 11, 18 and 22 in the previous three) and Diogo Jota (13 and nine, in the current and last terms). City have been the kings of sharing goals around. In Guardiola’s first three seasons the now departed Sergio Agüero hit 20, 21, and 21. The latter two tallies were accumulated in championship-winning XIs: the first featured contributions from Sterling (18), Jesus (13) and Leroy Sané (10). In the second, Sterling (17) and Sané (10) were to the fore, while Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Jesus all chipped in with seven. This season Sterling and Mahrez have 10 apiece, Kevin De Bruyne nine, Phil Foden and Silva seven each. Agüero’s exit last summer left a club-record 260-goal hole in the forward line. This is why first Kane was pursued and now Haaland. The Norwegian’s numbers for Dortmund: 16 in 15 Bundesliga appearances, six assists; 23 strikes in 22 appearances in all competitions, including three in three Champions League outings. Overall career statistics: 80 in 80 for Dortmund, 20 in 20 for Molde, 29 in 27 for Salzburg, and 12 in 15 for Norway, the zero in 16 for his first club, Bryne, long forgotten. This record is one reason why Guardiola is keen to sign the 21-year-old: imagine how many more goals City would score with Haaland in the XI. But another relates to City’s defence and how the opposition try to unlock it. Here, think of the home reverses to Palace (2-0) and Tottenham (3-2), plus myriad matches where Guardiola’s high-lying rearguard has been vulnerable to raids launched over the top or along the sides. The tactic requires a low block that is tricky for City to break down. In most contests this is managed by a kind of speedy five-a-side play that incorporates passing down the wings and incisive penalty area forays. When, though, this is failing, Guardiola wants a dedicated target-man to offer variation. “If we have a striker, we play in a different way but if you don’t have it you have to adapt with the quality [abilities] that we have,” he says. What Haaland – or any No 9 – must also possess is an ability to be fluid, to understand and execute City’s constant off-the-front patterns. The Norwegian has this, as was illustrated by Marco Reus’s strike in last season’s 2-1 Champions League defeat at City: Haaland dropped into a pocket to become a de facto No 10 who created the chance. So in the pursuit of Haaland (or anyone else) Guardiola wants to recruit yet another smart-brained, pass-and-move footballer, but one who adds an Agüero-like proven eye for goal to a squad already bristling with talent. It sounds like a frightening prospect for City’s opponents. They are pretty scared already.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola hopes to end the hunt for true No 9 with Erling Haaland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/pep-guardiola-hunt-for-true-no-9-likely-to-end-with-erling-haaland-manchester-city
3/20/2022,"A Triple Crown, a bonus point in every round, whichever way you look at it, Ireland continue to develop impressive momentum. Here, they were too powerful for a visiting Scotland side who played with all the brio and pace we have come to expect – but without the heavy-duty weaponry that lifts Ireland into a category above. Scotland played in devil-may-care mode, another championship long gone, a new playmaker at fly-half and nothing to lose. Nothing to win either, bar maybe a victory far too late, but they are never less than dangerous these days. Their slashes and parries, though, could not break Ireland’s skin. And Ireland knew how to break theirs. They had to wait till the death to register that fourth try, but no one was surprised when it came. Ireland’s game was spearheaded by some ferocious forwards, particularly yet another bristling hooker for the future in Dan Sheehan. The balance of, well, power when the game crept into charging distance of either tryline was firmly in their favour. The modern narrative between these two resumed pretty much from the kick-off – that is to say that Scotland slashed with their rapier, to which Ireland responded with a bludgeon. That may be a crude summary – Ireland certainly know how to deploy sleight of hand when the situation demands – but when it comes to the brutality of the close quarters in what people love to refer to these days as the Red Zone, Ireland could resort to some brutal weapons. Hence their early 14-0 lead, despite some exhilarating approach work from their visitors, who had held the edge in possession. The trouble with the rapier is that it requires a higher level of accuracy to make tell. Darcy Graham is about as rapier-like as any international player. He slashed this way and that, as did Ali Price, as did Hamish Watson, small and darting all of them. Pierre Schoeman is not so little and he found himself in space too early on. Nothing of substance came from any of it. Then Ireland had a go. Jamison Gibson-Park wielded his own rapier, which Stuart Hogg dealt with masterfully, but soon some flashing hands by Ireland’s backs created an attack down the left. Over to the bludgeon. A penalty was sent to the corner, the lineout secured and towards the end of the first quarter Sheehan broke off the maul to the line. Ten minutes later, another lineout and another charge by Sheehan set Ireland up for some more boshing. Cian Healy was the next to barge to the line. Scotland were exasperated to find themselves 14-0 down with half an hour gone, but they responded. Graham was off again down the right after flashing Scottish hands released him, then Watson slipped a fabulous ball to Schoeman, Graham darted again – the usual suspects – off an inside ball from Scotland’s new fly-half, Blair Kinghorn, and moments later, Schoeman burrowed to the line. Kinghorn was looking elegant at No 10. And if anyone in these parts can hoof a ball as far as Hogg, he is that man. Alas, his conversion was not so great, so Scotland went in 14-5 down at the break. They knew they had to be the first to score after it. They duly created the clearest-cut chance and they missed it. Hogg and rapier are basically synonymous, but he has history here of missing precious opportunities. He was clean through on the last man, with Chris Harris and Kyle Steyn free inside him, and he went for the corner himself – in vain. The moment was overshadowed by the latest trial by TMO of an incident earlier in the passage of play. Happily, Wayne Barnes, ever the most reasonable of referees, resisted any temptation to take action against Schoeman for his collision with an upright tackler. A let-off for Scotland some will no doubt argue, but the greater let-off in that particular passage was for Ireland. They took advantage on the hour. Scotland managed to thwart one attacking lineout, but they set up another after Scotland were penalised at their own scrum. Mack Hansen combined with James Lowe, and Ireland were in a position to bludgeon. But it was a smart switch pass by Gibson-Park that released Josh van der Flier to burst through the last tacklers. Scotland did have further chances in the final quarter, but they could not locate the wherewithal – for which read power – to make it tell. Conor Murray’s barrelling run through three tacklers off Lowe’s pass out of a maul completed yet another maximum haul for Ireland.",Sport/Sport,Murray seals Ireland win over Scotland to keep Six Nations title hopes alive,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/ireland-scotland-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
3/20/2022,"Uncertainty and confusion have made an unwelcome intrusion into Chelsea’s world but, for the moment at least, they show no signs of encroaching on to the pitch. As a bewildering number of prospective buyers waited to learn if they might be handed the keys to Stamford Bridge, a mixture of occasionally ruthless control and measured efficiency propelled Chelsea into the semi-finals courtesy of goals from Romelu Lukaku and the excellent Hakim Ziyech. Middlesbrough are pushing hard for promotion from the Championship and eliminated Manchester United and Tottenham in earlier rounds, but despite some decent periods of intelligent play, they rarely succeeded in unhinging a visiting defence marshalled by Thiago Silva and Antonio Rüdiger. Middlesbrough kicked off exhibiting the sort of quiet confidence befitting a side that had won their previous nine home games but their reasons for optimism were dented after 14 minutes. When Ziyech’s delivery picked out Mason Mount wide on the right, the latter was allowed to advance and unleash a beautifully weighted low cross for Lukaku to sweep into the back of net courtesy of a first-time shot from six yards. “Champions of Europe, we know who we are,” chanted the 700-odd Chelsea fans gathered in the south-east corner of the ground. That select band had bought tickets before the government imposed sanctions against their club’s departing owner, Roman Abramovich, preventing any further sales of seats to away supporters. Mount created Chelsea’s second goal, too. This time Middlesbrough’s attempt to press their guests into submission broke down, resulting in a counterattack featuring Mount running with the ball before playing in Ziyech and watching his fellow midfielder’s left foot do the rest. Ziyech celebrated his 29th birthday in style. After cutting in he extended his favoured foot and sent an audacious, angled 20-yard shot swerving and dipping beyond the outstretched fingertips of Joe Lumley. Within minutes, Lumley was rescued by Anfernee Dijksteel, the defender’s impeccably timed goalline clearance denying Lukaku a second goal after the Belgian had wrongfooted the goalkeeper. Given that Dijksteel had impressed in the back three with some important interceptions, it seemed rather appropriate that he, albeit briefly, enjoyed a moment in the spotlight. As the sun sank behind the main stand and the sky morphed from blue to dusky pink, Édouard Mendy remained a peripheral figure as Middlesbrough struggled to get behind Rüdiger and company. Despite the best efforts of Isaiah Jones, Middlesbrough’s talented right wing-back, the Chelsea defence persistently second-guessed even his most inventive manoeuvres. When the Championship side finally managed a shot, Jonny Howson failed to trouble Mendy. Chelsea’s continued resistance to the pressing tactics that have undone so many second-tier opponents must have left Wilder wishing the government had not relented to the London club’s pleas for an enhanced travel allowance. Maybe, just maybe, if they had stuck to the original budget and forced Chelsea to travel to the north-east by bus rather than fly to Teesside airport they might have shown signs of tiredness as dusk descended. Instead Ziyech in particular looked increasingly lively. Wilder’s cause was further hindered by the injuries to two members of his back three that forced the replacement of Dael Fry and then Paddy McNair with the 37-year-old Sol Bamba and the 35-year-old Lee Peltier. Not that Bamba remotely showed his years, though, as his exquisite tackle came between Lukaku and another Chelsea goal. If only Folarin Balogun, Middlesbrough’s striker on loan from Arsenal, had shown similar composure after Matt Crook’s smart backheel flick had fooled Malang Sarr and left him with only Mendy to beat. Unable to seize the moment, Balogun sent a shot ballooning over the bar as the thoughts of the home fans surely began turning to their hopes of securing a play-off place. At least Lumley atoned for his arguable culpability in the second goal when he palmed away a header from the substitute Timo Werner in the wake of Ziyech’s whipped-in free-kick. Middlesbrough improved as the second half wore on and Mendy had to react quickly to intercept Duncan Watmore’s menacing cross as Josh Coburn, the scorer of the fifth-roundwinner against Spurs, waited to lash it over the line. It was not to be but Middlesbrough have enriched this season’s FA Cup and their owner, Steve Gibson, looked unusually emotional as the ground choir sang “Stand up if you love the Boro” and “Only one Stevie Gibson”.",Sport/Football,Hakim Ziyech sinks Middlesbrough to send Chelsea into FA Cup semi-final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/middlesbrough-chelsea-fa-cup-match-report
3/20/2022,"UK authorities have grounded another plane to investigate possible links with Russia, the transport secretary has announced. Russian airlines and private jets are prohibited from landing in the UK and it is a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly or land in the UK. The ban includes any aircraft owned, operated or chartered by anyone connected with Russia or designated individuals or entities on the sanctions list. It also allows the government to detain any aircraft owned by anyone connected with Russia. On Saturday, Grant Shapps tweeted: “Today I have taken rapid action to identify and ground another plane pending inquiries about possible Russian links. We are continuing to take decisive action against Putin and his illegal war in Ukraine.” A source said the government issued a notice to airmen at 10.22am to prevent a flight that is in dispute from taking off from London Biggin Hill Airport. The Cessna Citation Latitude 680A plane, owned by Brooker Holdings Ltd, will remain at the airport while an investigation is undertaken into any potential affiliations with Russia. Last week, the UK impounded a private jet linked to Eugene Shvidler, a billionaire Russian oligarch, on the orders of Shapps. The Luxembourg-registered aircraft flew from the US state of New Jersey into Farnborough airport, Hampshire, on 3 March. The Bombardier Global 6500 jet had been due to fly from the UK to Dubai but UK authorities prevented this while they investigated whether it was permanently leased to Shvidler and fell under UK sanctions. Shapps revoked the plane’s foreign carrier permit, meaning it could not legally carry passengers, and issued a restriction of flying order, in effect grounding the plane. Shvidler has not been personally sanctioned by the UK government at any stage.",News/World news,UK grounds plane ahead of inquiry into possible Russian links,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/uk-grounds-plane-ahead-of-inquiry-into-possible-russian-links
