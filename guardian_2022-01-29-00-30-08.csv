1/29/2022,"John Terry has removed the Premier League trophy from the cartoon ape non-fungible token (NFT) digital assets he has been promoting on Twitter after a legal intervention by the league. The Premier League trophy is protected by its trademark and its use in any commercial venture requires a licensing agreement with the league. The league wrote to Terry and “Ape Kids Club”, the NFT collection promoted by the former Chelsea and England captain, to make that point this week.  Other tweets featuring NFTs, a digital asset bought and sold online, of famous players portrayed as cartoon apes beside the Premier League trophy have been deleted. One tweet featuring the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, Community Shield and FA Cup trophies was on Terry’s Twitter profile at the time of writing. Chelsea have also looked into the cartoons because some have included images of the club’s badge. Uefa, which organises the Europa League and Champions League, has taken legal advice and is investigating the matter. The Football Association is also aware of the NFT activity related to Terry’s account, which includes use of the FA Cup trophy, the Community Shield and the England kit. Terry, who has taken up a consultancy role in Chelsea’s academy, has been heavily promoting the “Ape Kids Club” NFTs on Twitter. Others who have endorsed them are Bobby Zamora, Jack Wilshere and Nigel de Jong. Terry’s former Chelsea and England teammate Ashley Cole retweeted one post containing an image of the trophies. The Chelsea and England full-back Reece James has tweeted about acquiring a “Mutant Ape” NFT. “Ape Kids Club” NFTS are an offshoot of another popular NFT, the “Bored Ape Yacht Club”. The collection features 10,000 digital illustrations of cartoon apes. The “Ape Kids Club” features 9,999 different ape NFTs available for purchase. NFTs are unique digital assets stored on the Blockchain and traded in cryptocurrencies. The ownership and provenance of NFTs are verified by the Blockchain, an online ledger. The two biggest cryptocurrencies are bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are more than 5,000 different varieties. Critics argue the tokens are potentially dangerous financial assets. NFTs remain part of an unregulated financial sector.",Sport/Football,John Terry removes Premier League trophy on NFTs after legal intervention,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/john-terry-removes-premier-league-trophy-on-nfts-after-legal-intervention
1/29/2022,"You’d think we’d be absolutely dripping in zombies by now, wouldn’t you? It feels a fairly obvious genre for TV shows to get into at the moment. After all, look where we are. We’re in the third year of a once-a-century pandemic that has ripped its way across the entire planet without pause, killing millions and devastating families. Sound familiar? Honestly, swap out a dry cough for a ceaseless undead thirst for human flesh and Covid is a zombie analogue. It’s not as if we’ve been reluctant to use them in the past. The original Haitian archetype used zombies as a metaphor for the dehumanisation of enslaved people under French colonial rule. Over the years, Hollywood has dusted them off to symbolise everything from consumerism to McCarthyism to immigration to globalisation to emotional stuntedness.  Maybe in time more producers will use zombies to make sense of the Covid era. But for now we’re going to have to make do with All of Us Are Dead, Netflix’s new South Korean zombie drama. Which isn’t such a bad thing, because it’s great. Set in and around a Korean secondary school, All of Us Are Dead is your classic zombie outbreak story. A girl gets bitten by a lab rat, and then she, in turn, bites a classmate, and, before you know it, the whole city is overrun by mutilated, gargling zombies. What keeps it fresh, though, is the setting. Having high school students as the main characters is a very clever move. Flung about by their hormones, the students’ oversized reactions to the situation heightens the mood of the show. And the fact that they’re always preoccupied with their own stuff, no matter how apocalyptic things get, means that the story can tick along nicely independently of the zombie horde. Watching All of Us Are Dead, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was designed as a Covid metaphor or whether, just like every other vaguely disaster-themed film and show of the last two years, it was simply a case of bad timing. My feeling is that, even if it was the latter, it went to great pains to reverse-engineer itself to our times. Here, the zombies are created by a virus and – by dint of the fact that it’s set in a school – we get plenty of GCSE-level infection talk. Most pressingly, however (and I need to be coy for fear of spoiling it), this is a virus that behaves like Covid in one key way. That’s as much as I can get into, but it’s the masterstroke of the series. God, South Korea is good at this sort of thing. This is the third Korean Netflix original in just a few months to blow me away. And while it won’t repeat the planet-crushing success of Squid Game – nothing will, not even Squid Game season two – it still reverberates with the same winningly doomy existentialism of Hellbound. Of course, they were going to crush at zombies too. Anyone who has seen Train to Busan will know that South Korea are world beaters when it comes to telling stories about the undead. That said, I still have to confess to being on the fence about long-form zombie stories. As much as everyone liked The Walking Dead, I still prefer my zombie stories to be told in the form of a finite movie. The very best zombie movies – and Train to Busan is a perfect example – gets the premise out of the way neatly and quickly, before breathlessly shoving its characters through a series of obstacles before (if we’re lucky) extinguishing all hope of survival just before the credits roll. Meanwhile, All of Us Are Dead is about 12 hours long. There are only so many things that you can do with a zombie story, and this show doesn’t invent any new moves, so we do spend a lot of time repeating the same basic scene set-up. The biting. The sneaking. The saying goodbye to the newly infected before their humanity evaporates. It’s a testament to the power of the characters, here, that this carousel of secondhand tropes never quite manages to slip into tedium. You can even forgive All of Us Are Dead for hedging its bets at the end, too. As I’ve said, my favourite zombie stories are the ones where all of humanity gets swamped and there is no escape. All of Us Are Dead seems to have been written with a second season in mind, so things don’t end in an especially satisfying way. But, hey, if that means there’ll be more of this, bring it on. We have to take our zombie stories where we can find them these days.",Arts/Television & radio,All of Us Are Dead: Netflix’s Korean zombie show will blow you away,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/all-of-us-are-dead-netflixs-korean-zombie-show-will-blow-you-away
1/29/2022,"From open-heart surgery on a snake to putting your dog through chemotherapy, there have never been so many options to treat unwell pets. But vets are warning that too many owners are spending huge amounts of money on keeping their pets alive, even when it’s not always the most humane option. Channel 4’s Supervet and news stories such as Goldie the pufferfish’s tooth surgery are making pet-owners aware of the increasingly advanced and complex surgical and medical procedures that pets can undergo.  While veterinary science has made impressive advances in recent years, allowing many pets to be healthier for longer, vets warn that extending an animal’s life at all costs is not always the best option for them, and can result in bills worth thousands of pounds for their owners. Danny Chambers, a vet in Hampshire who runs a phone-in on BBC Radio Devon, said: “There are some situations where for the welfare of the animal, euthanasia would be appropriate to end the suffering. If you’re going to put them through quite complex surgery which has many months’ recovery time with complications, there is an ethical discussion to be had around that.” Chambers cited the example of a person undergoing chemotherapy. Although it is a long and painful process, humans are able to rationalise suffering as a means to get better, or to enable them to spend time with family or to do things they’ve dreamed of. “Animals don’t have a desire to live a long life, they don’t want to make it to Christmas or someone’s birthday or to be 10 years older. They just want to be happy day-by-day.” He said most vets were able to give a list of three to five options for treatment plans, and that owners shouldn’t feel as if they have to choose the most expensive one if they can’t afford it, especially since that won’t always be best for the animal’s welfare. “I hope people don’t feel guilty for not being wealthy enough to try these advanced procedures when the reality is that dogs are quite happy when given the best treatment you can afford.” Andrew Knight, a veterinary professor at the University of Winchester, said part of the reason for higher expectations from owners was that they “are increasingly viewing their animals as important members of their households and families”. He added that, as people are treated for free on the NHS, they often don’t understand the costs of some of the most advanced medical and surgical procedures, especially without pet insurance. “These can be unexpectedly expensive, even though they constitute very good value, compared to the costs of medical care for people.” Sean McCormack, a vet in Surrey who writes a newspaper advice column, said that where previously people would consider complex treatments only for pets such as dogs and cats, he was seeing an increase in demand from people who had developed “a close emotional bond” with more unusual pets such as turtles, rabbits and snakes. He has removed tumours from fish, done open-heart surgery on a snake, spayed a gecko, removed a bladder stone from an iguana and pinned, plated and fixed broken wings on birds. Readers who replied to a Guardian callout shared their stories of complex surgeries for their pets, and the thousands of pounds they had spent, with many considering it worth it to keep their beloved animals alive. Lisa Kucyk, from Swansea, estimated veterinary bills for her dog Nambo at up to £20,000. He had four operations on problems with his legs, including damage to his cruciate ligament, patella and cartilage, before he was diagnosed with degenerative myelopathy, the canine equivalent of motor neurone disease. He now has weekly physiotherapy, acupuncture and laser therapy. Kucyk said she had bought the highest insurance coverage available for Nambo at the time, but still had to dip into savings to cover his final two operations, at £3,000 each. Nambo is now paralysed, and Kucyk is able to keep him alive while she works from home, but she knows her physio will tell her when his quality of life has deteriorated to the point he needs to be euthanised. Kucyk said the bills and care were worth it: “He’s a member of our family, and to be honest I prefer my dog over most people. He’s everything to me.” Justine Shotton, the president of the British Veterinary Association, said that owners should be assured that vets always conduct a quality of life assessment and will advise on health and welfare impact and the costs involved. She said: “In some cases, they may recommend that euthanasia is in the best interests of an animal if their quality of life is low, or if a treatment option may cause them a lot of pain and suffering or carry low chances of success. “These are very difficult conversations, which take an emotional toll on all involved.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Too many pets kept alive when it’s not the kindest option, say vets",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/28/too-many-pets-kept-alive-when-its-not-the-kindest-option-say-vets
1/29/2022,"A senior official at the Foreign Office has apologised for misleading MPs over whether Boris Johnson’s views had been sought over the evacuation of animals from Kabul during the chaotic retreat from Afghanistan last August. Sir Philip Barton, the Foreign Office’s permanent undersecretary, had told the foreign affairs committee that Nigel Casey, the prime minister’s special representative for Afghanistan, had not received any correspondence referring to an intervention by Boris Johnson in the evacuation of animals from the Nowzad charity.  But emails revealed by Newsnight, showed Casey did “seek clear guidance for us from No 10 asap on what they would like us to do” in the case. Barton has now written to the committee’s chairman, the Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, to apologise for giving “inadvertently inaccurate answers”. He said that “on the day the email was sent, Nigel was almost entirely focused, in his role as Gold in our crisis response, on the terrorist threat to the evacuation”. Last month in evidence to the committee, Barton was challenged about a letter sent by the MP Trudy Harrison, the parliamentary private secretary to Johnson, to the Nowzad founder Pen Farthing setting out confirmation from the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence that the animal evacuation flight could take place. Labour’s Chris Bryant, questioning Barton, said: “That feels to me very much like a direction from the prime minister … that does not equate with what you’ve told us, does it?” At the time Barton replied: “I am not aware of the letter you are talking about. I am happy to look at it, but we have not set out this afternoon to mislead you.” During the session to the committee, Barton was also criticised by MPs for remaining on holiday after Kabul fell in August. In his apology letter, Sir Philip said Casey has “no recollection of having seen emails in which staff attributed this decision to the prime minister”, adding: “Nor do I.” His clarification and apology will fuel the continuing row about the prime minister’s honesty. On Thursday Johnson has said any allegations that he personally intervened to get the animals out of Afghanistan were “total rhubarb”. And Downing Street has repeatedly denied intervening in any individual cases in the final days of the mission as thousands of people who sought to flee the Taliban were left behind. But the prime minister has been accused of lying after leaked correspondence suggested the involvement of No 10. An email leaked this week to the committee from a Foreign Office official working in the private office of the Tory peer Zac Goldsmith said: “The PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated.” The BBC reported another email from the same day saying the then-foreign secretary Dominic Raab was “seeking a steer from No 10 on whether” to call Nowzad staff forward. BBC Newsnight’s Sima Kotecha obtained an email from the deputy principal private secretary to Raab at the time discussing Nowzad staff being called forward for evacuation. “The FS is seeking a steer from No 10 on whether to call them forward now,” it read. Another email from Casey showed him asking a security official “to seek clear guidance for us from No 10 asap on what they would like us to do”. Allies of Johnson tried to downplay the situation, with the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, dismissing calls for a debate as “fussing about a few animals”. The emails to the Commons inquiry were leaked by Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office at the time and alleges the animals were evacuated after an order from Johnson. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “It’s not uncommon in Whitehall for a decision to be interpreted or portrayed as coming directly from the prime minister even when that’s not the case, and it’s our understanding that’s what happened in this instance. “We appreciate it was a frenetic time for those officials dealing with this situation.”",News/Politics,Kabul animal airlift: Foreign Office says sorry for misleading MPs on No 10 emails,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/kabul-animal-airlift-foreign-office-says-sorry-for-misleading-mps-on-no-10-emails

The tricks are to rest the pastry, watch the tarts carefully while they’re baking and have patience while they cool.  I used 2cm x 8cm round pastry rings to make these. Prep 15 minChill 6 hr+Cook 45 minMakes 7 small tartlets For the pastry140g plain flourA pinch of sea salt45g icing sugarZest of ½ lemon75g unsalted butter, cold and cubed1 egg (50g) For the filling375ml double cream150g caster sugarA pinch of salt120ml lemon juice (ie, from 3 large lemons)6 egg yolks (20g each) For the pastry, in a large bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer or food processor, combine the flour, salt, icing sugar and lemon zest, and mix well. Add the cold, cubed butter and, using your fingertips, the paddle attachment of a stand mixer or the pulse setting on a food processor, rub into the flour mixture until it has the texture of breadcrumbs. Add the egg, mix until it comes together, then tip on to a work surface and knead gently to form a smooth ball. Wrap tightly, pat into a disc, then refrigerate for four hours, until chilled. Remove from the fridge and knead gently, then divide into seven even balls. Press these into the individual tart cases using your thumbs, then return to the fridge to rest and firm up. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Put the lined tart shells on an oven tray, put a scrunched-up sheet of greaseproof paper in each tart shell and fill to the top with baking beans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Remove from the oven, carefully lift out the paper and beans, then return to the oven for five minutes, until the insides are also golden brown. For the filling, warm the cream, sugar and salt until steaming, leave to bubble a little, then pour in the lemon juice and stir. Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl. Pour the hot lemon/cream mixture on to the yolks, whisk to combine, then pour through a fine sieve into a jug. Turn up the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Fill the tart shells with the warm lemon custard filling and put the tray on a rack close to the top of the oven for four to seven minutes. Keep an eye on them: the filling should bubble and caramelise in patches. Once baked, leave to cool at room temperature, then refrigerate for two to four hours, until cold and set.

1/29/2022,"Think of the world map and it’s likely we all imagine the same one. But that map, created by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569, is inaccurate. It makes the western world seem bigger, diminishing the size of Africa and equatorial nations (Greenland looks as big as Africa – it’s roughly the size of Algeria), and prompting criticism that it promotes an imperialist viewpoint. So should we get a new world map? I asked Donald Houston, professor of geography at the University of Portsmouth. Why is the internet telling me the map is a lie?Mercator created the map on the eve of exploration for Europe, and wanted something that was useful for sea navigation. The problem is, the world is round and a map is flat. I give my first-year students an orange and ask them to peel it in one piece and lay it flat. It can’t be done – it rips and deforms. On a sphere, the longitudinal lines converge at the poles but at the equator run parallel. Mercator kept those longitudinal lines parallel throughout, prioritising the accuracy of the shape of the land. It ends up exaggerating land mass nearer the poles.  Oh, so he was only accidentally racist?I’m not sure we could say he was a racist – he never travelled, and was more of a devout Catholic scholar. Donald, I’m joking, I’m not trying to cancel Gerardus! I’m impressed he did all that with just his brain and a ruler. But we should probably have something accurate.That’s the thing – it’s fundamentally impossible to get a nice, neat, rectangular but accurate map of the world. People have been suggesting using the Peters projection, but where Mercator distorts size but keeps shape, Peters is accurate with size but not shape. The best thing, I think, is a physical globe. It’s quite poetic, really – how we humans long to hold the world in our hands but we never can.Also, we don’t really need Mercator’s projection, because ships navigate using GPS. There are just so many reasons to move away from it. It emphasises nation states and borders, which are a western concept anyway. Why not a map that shows people, population numbers? Right … that’s why maps are so brilliant, because they also tell you about a society’s priorities. But GPS isn’t perfect. I went up the Brecon Beacons using GPS – the signal crashed, I got lost, I must have trespassed on a dozen farms. Frankly, I’m surprised I didn’t get shot.That’s because your GPS is different from the ones ships use. But I do worry about Google Maps becoming the only map. It’s just a street map. Oh my! I just opened Google Maps now and zoomed out to see the world. Even with all their tech, it looks as if they’re using something like Mercator. Greenland is huge!Great … so an alien new arrival can think the world was made up of multinational food outlets. Mercator produced a map for navigation; the fact that it wasn’t challenged as the dominant map until the 1970s, and still adorns some Google maps, is shocking. Right, I’m ordering a globe right now. How about the one that you can keep booze inside?Well, they don’t have the poles, but why not. It might be a good thing to compensate for centuries of Mercator’s projection.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Should the world map be more realistic?

1/29/2022,"Aston Villa have had a €25m (£20.8m) bid for the midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur turned down by Juventus. They were offering a guaranteed €20m with the rest in add-ons but the Italian club are demanding more because of a sell-on clause with Bentancur’s previous club, Boca Juniors. Bentancur, a Uruguay international, joined Juventus from Boca in 2017 and has continued to be a regular this season, starting five of the club’s six Champions League group games and 13 matches in Serie A.  Villa have been among the Premier League’s most active clubs in the transfer window, their acquisition of the defender Calum Chambers from Arsenal on Thursday taking to four the players signed since Steven Gerrard took over as manager. Lucas Digne, Philippe Coutinho and Robin Olsen have also been brought in. Bentacur is with Uruguay for their World Cup qualifiers and started Thursday’s win in Paraguay.

1/29/2022,"Neil Young this week issued Spotify with a blunt ultimatum: it’s me or Joe Rogan. The Canadian-American musician criticised its exclusive hosting of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast in a letter to his manager and record label published online, which asked his music be removed from the streaming service. Spotify chose Rogan, removing Young’s entire back catalogue.Young’s objections were based on what he saw as “life-threatening Covid misinformation” being pushed by Rogan. This claim was supported in a letter sent to the streaming service earlier this month, signed by 270 medical and scientific professionals who called for Spotify to stop spreading Rogan’s unfounded point of view. Young had the courage of his convictions – and the backing of his long-term label Reprise Records (part of Warner Music Group), because, as he said in a statement on his website, removing his music would mean “losing 60% of my worldwide streaming income in the name of Truth”. The decision from Spotify draws an entirely new battle line for the service when facing down artists. In the past, fights tended to be around commercial issues, with artists arguing the micro-payments it made for streams were unfairly low; this new conflict is remarkable for being entirely ideological. These recent moves feel like a grand betrayal of Spotify’s roots in liberal Sweden, where it was founded. This is a company where diversity is applauded, paternity leave is encouraged, the mental wellbeing of staff is deemed paramount and efforts to promote artists from outside of a heterosexual and Caucasian orthodoxy have become part of the raison d’etre – such as the Unlike Any Other initiative around Pride 2020 and the Frequency campaign in 2021, which was intended to help elevate Black artists.  What is unfolding is a complex ethical and financial conundrum for Daniel Ek, Spotify’s co-founder and CEO. Is he happy for Spotify to amplify medical misinformation through, among others, its crown-jewel podcast, a show it paid a rumoured $100m (£75m) to have on an exclusive basis? Or will he have the company tightly police and factcheck what its podcasters say? The rapidly curdling, and inherently Faustian nature of the Rogan deal should not surprise anyone. Rogangate says a tremendous amount about Spotify’s new priorities. No longer just a music streaming service, Spotify now regards itself as an audio platform and podcasting as its new centre of gravity. Part of the appeal of podcasts for Spotify is that they represent a different type of listening: rather than an album every two or three years from a favourite artist, there is new content every week, at least. Such frequency of output reinforces consumer loyalty – and so subscribers – far better than any single artist can, which may be why Spotify is so hesitant to let Rogan go, or even just to curb some of his more extreme opinions. Rogan draws in listeners – with an estimated 11 million for each episode – and he holds them there. We can date the shift to April 2018, when the company launched its direct listing on the New York stock exchange – and Manhattan, rather than Stockholm, became the company’s geographical and cultural epicentre. This was the moment Spotify became more Wall Street, and less Stortorget. Spotify has a history of making bad decisions. There was an ugly and public war with Taylor Swift in 2014 over its royalty rates. Then there was its bungled “hate content and hateful conduct” policy in 2018, which was seen to remove a disproportionate amount of content by Black artists. But in those instances, Spotify eventually softened its stance. This tendency to conciliation has collapsed as the company recalibrates its ethical and ideological viewpoints to be much more American: naked capitalism, regardless of the negative consequences, seems now to triumph internally at the company over all.The problem, though, with not just flirting with, but financially enabling, someone who prides themselves on “saying the unsayable” is that they may go further and wilder with every utterance. It’s not as if Spotify was hoodwinked into giving Rogan a show: he self-produced his podcast since 2009 and the media provider signed him up precisely because the controversy he generates brings in audiences. While it might make sense in terms of its balance sheet, fighting Rogan’s corner could prove to be Spotify’s most reckless, arrogant and hubristic decision yet: the ultimate cost being not its market cap, but its reputation, its listeners’ loyalty and its soul.
