1/31/2022,"The Cincinnati Bengals are going to the Super Bowl. Repeat: The Cincinnati Bengals are going to the Super Bowl.  One more time, so it truly sets in: The Cincinnati Bengals, two years after sinking to the league’s basement, are 60 minutes away from winning it all. It was fitting that on the weekend in which Tom Brady’s retirement was teased, Joe Burrow shone. Brady was the spiritual heir to his hero Joe Montana. In Burrow, the league has a quarterback who neatly completes the circle; another player with a backstory that would be rejected as corny were it fiction. Another instant franchise changer. Another player who raises his game in the biggest moments. In Burrow, the NFL has found its new Joe Cool. Time and again, no matter how iffy the play-call, no matter how poor the protection, no matter how many resources a defense allocates to the Bengals’ No 1 receiver Ja’Marr Chase, Burrow finds a way. He slips and slides. He bobs and weaves. Burrow is not a supreme athlete but he does just enough to keep the chains moving, to avoid pressure, to extend plays and drives, to give his team a chance to score points when the other parts of the offense do click. He is the ultimate problem solver. JOE BURROW IS RIDICULOUS ‼️(via @NFL)pic.twitter.com/vjvemXy8Xc Unflappable. Unwavering. Call it what you want. As the intensity rises, Burrow finds a way to produce. Only two quarterbacks have led teams to college football’s FBS National Championship and a Super Bowl title: Montana and Joe Namath. In two weeks, Burrow can become the third. Sunday’s game will be principally remembered for Burrow’s excellence. But this was as much a Chiefs loss as a Bengals win. Throughout the first half, the Chiefs were at their unstoppable best on offense. The run-game was rolling. Mahomes was dancing. Everything was clicking. On defense, they contained Burrow, Chase and Joe Mixon, cutting the supply line from the quarterback to his most dangerous receiver and swamping the Bengals’ run-game with bodies at the line of scrimmage. And then it flipped. A dodgy fourth-down call from the Chiefs’ coaching staff to end the half saw the Chiefs go for a touchdown when a field goal would have pushed their half-time lead from 11 to 14 points. In the second half, they flat-lined. There was a complacence to their play: “Pffft, we’ll figure it out.” The game took a similar pattern to the Week 17 matchup, which the Bengals won. The Bengals adjusted on defense, backing everybody up, baiting the Chiefs to continue to run the ball, and forcing Mahomes to make the same choice over and over again: Should I push the ball downfield into danger or play it safe and pass short? Mahomes chose the latter – or was caught in two minds – and the offense bogged down. His timing was shaken. The Bengals pass-rush started to generate a smidge of pressure in crucial spots. But for most of the half, they ditched the notion of pressure altogether, freeing up Mahomes to indulge his own worst instincts. He held onto the ball… and held onto the ball… and held on some more. The Chiefs’ offense devolved into a freelancing mess. The usual crispness was gone. Over the course of the second half, Mahomes completed just nine of 19 passes for 55 yards, throwing no touchdowns. Then, disaster for the Chiefs: Turnovers. For all the Chiefs’ explosiveness on offense, the secret to their success is that they do not hand the opposition chances. Mahomes had thrown just a single interception in his entire playoff career heading into Sunday. Against the Bengals, he tossed two in the second half: One to swing the game, setting up Burrow and the Cincy offense in scoring range; one in overtime to give the Bengals a shot to walk off. It was the worst half of Mahomes’ young career. He was tentative in the pocket, taking too long to make decisions – and moving into pressure, where there were escape hatches elsewhere. Burrow and the Bengals took advantage. It was Burrow’s ability to move and extend plays that proved the difference when the two sides met a month ago, and it was the same on Sunday. He picked up four first downs on four rushing attempts, scrambling away from pressure to extend drives. Burrow was bogged down by his own team’s dodgy play-calling, but when his number was called on third and long, he delivered each and every time. Ja'Marr Chase and Joe Burrow's fathers celebrated the AFC Championship by smoking cigars 😂🤝 pic.twitter.com/I3C9bq1NgV Burrow’s legend – the coats, the walk, the cigars, the championships – was born in Ohio and burgeoned during his extraordinary college career in Louisiana. In 2019, the Bengals bottomed out, handing them the first overall pick and a chance to bring Burrow home when he was drafted in April 2020. He joined the worst team in the league, and transformed the franchise – its record, its aura, all of it – in 21 short months. “I’m tired of the underdog narrative. We’ve got good players, good coaches,” Burrow said before the game. The Bengals, and Burrow, are underdogs no more. The Rams overcame the largest deficit in the fourth quarter of a championship game (10 points) to beat the Niners, 20-17. It was a strange game in LA, one in which the play clock often felt more like a suggestion than a law, and with two coaching staffs seemingly hellbent on undermining their own efforts with sloppy game-management. Two of the league’s top offensive minds looked frazzled in the fourth quarter. Sean McVay burned all of his timeouts and challenges with 10 minutes to play. Kyle Shanahan’s offense turned into a pumpkin when his team needed it most. The Niners’ possessed the ball three times after taking that 10-point lead in the fourth quarter. The result: 12 plays, 26 yards, just four minutes rolling off the clock. Brutal. It wasn’t quite 28-3 or the Niners’ collapse against the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV, but it exists in the same orbit – part of the mounting evidence that when things get tight late in the game, so does the Niners’ head coach. The Rams collection of stars will now move on to the Super Bowl, proof positive that the team’s policy to go all-in on this season, shipping out a stack of future assets to acquire Jalen Ramsey, Matthew Stafford, and Von Miller over the past two seasons, was ultimately worth it – even if they needed a helping hand (or two) at the end. In San Francisco, they will be left to wonder what might have been had Shanahan better navigated the late-game situation or had Jaquiski Tartt caught a routine pop-up fly. Cooper Kupp, wide receiver, LA Rams. Who else? No amount of wonky clock management or puzzling game management calls from Sean McVay could stop Kupp from doing what he does best: getting open deep behind a defense. Kupp brought some sizzle to an otherwise stilted Rams offense late in the game. He finished with 11 catches for 142 yards and two touchdowns, including the touchdown grab that sparked the Rams’ comeback and a crucial catch and run that set up what proved to be the game-winning field goal. sometimes you just gotta love a good debacle of a live shot pic.twitter.com/Vx33uq0QF5 A delightful moment of half-time comedy in Kansas City. CBS pays billions of dollars to the NFL for broadcast rights. Given that NBC has the rotation for the Super Bowl this year, the AFC Championship represented CBS’s Game of the Year. And in that big spot: The network’s halftime show was drowned out by a concert blaring out in Arrowhead. It felt like a small win for TV viewers. For too long networks have shoved TV sets on the field for … what reason? Does any fan ever say “Oh, look, they’re really at the game!” Does it add anything to the broadcast other than, perhaps, some postgame activity – something that could be replicated by, I don’t know, leaving a studio and walking down to the field at the game’s conclusion. On-field analysis in a raucous stadium environment adds nothing for viewers. It’s time to ditch the practice. “This story is total conjecture. Tommy has not made a final decision one way or the other and anybody else that says that he has is absolutely wrong” – Tom Brady Sr on his son’s potential retirement. Tom Brady’s future has officially become a will-he-won’t-he saga. ESPN reported on Saturday that Brady’s 22nd season will be his last. Current and former teammates congratulated the game’s unanimous GOAT. His own company wished him the best in the future. But Brady has yet to inform the Buccaneers, according to reports. His father told reporters that the quarterback is yet to make a decision. Either Brady is playing a form of 4D chess, looking to exact some sort of press-based revenge on ESPN for the company’s reporting during Deflategate, or, Brady, ever the content creator, is keen to control his retirement narrative himself. Most likely, Brady will announce his retirement after the Super Bowl and will file the official paperwork once the new league season kicks in and he has received the final portion of his signing bonus with the Bucs.",Sport/Sport,Unflappable.

1/31/2022,"Brentford have announced the signing of the Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen on a deal until the end of the season. He was a free agent after being released by Internazionale in mid-December because his cardiac device implant means he is suspended from playing in Italy. Eriksen, 29, has not played since suffering a cardiac arrest during Denmark’s Euro 2020 game with Finland on 12 June and was keen for a return to top-level action in the hope of going to the World Cup.  Eriksen received lifesaving treatment on the pitch in Copenhagen and was fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator device (ICD). Serie A rules do not allow players with an ICD to compete. Phil Giles, Brentford’s director of football, said: “Brentford fans can rest assured that we have undertaken significant due diligence to ensure that Christian is in the best possible shape to return to competitive football.” Eight of Brentford’s players are from Denmark and so is the head coach, Thomas Frank, who worked with Eriksen in the national youth team set-up. “We have taken an unbelievable opportunity to bring a world-class player to Brentford,” Frank said. “He hasn’t trained with a team for seven months but has done a lot of work on his own. He is fit but we will need to get him match fit and I am looking forward to seeing him work with the players and staff to get back towards his highest level. At his best, Christian has the ability to dictate games.” Eriksen is not in contention for his Brentford debut in Saturday’s FA Cup tie at Everton. “Christian has recently received his Covid-19 vaccination and, in order to comply with rules regarding entry to the UK, he will travel to west London in the coming days and will not train with Brentford this week,” the club said. Eriksen spent six and a half seasons in the Premier League with Tottenham before joining Inter and has previously played for Ajax. At the start of January he outlined his ambitions for this year. “My goal is to play in the World Cup in Qatar,” he. “I want to play. That’s been my mindset all along. It’s a goal, a dream. Whether I’ll be picked is another thing. But it’s my dream to come back. I’m sure I can because I don’t feel any different. Physically, I’m back in top shape.”",Sport/Football,Brentford sign Christian Eriksen on deal until end of season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/brentford-sign-christian-eriksen-on-deal-until-end-of-season
1/31/2022,"There were two Australian Opens in 2022. One played out at Melbourne airport, in a refugee detention hotel and on the front of activists’ T-shirts. The other took place on tennis courts, and it is by virtue of the latter’s quality that the former will not dominate the collective memory. This tournament has been with little doubt one of the more extraordinary grand slams to date. Craig Tiley on Monday declared the 2022 Australian Open as “the best sporting event in the history of our game”.  Setting aside for one moment – if that is even possible – the remarkable Rafael Nadal, the local playing contingent quenched the public’s thirst for home success. Ash Barty shone, the Special Ks showboated and Dylan Alcott again showed us all what we can aspire to be. Australia has much to be thankful for. Tiley has much to be thankful for. He too will be feeling grateful, that his happy slam ended happily even though Novak Djokovic is exiled and we still don’t know where Peng Shuai is. The Tennis Australia chief executive and tournament director has pulled off a Nadal-esque comeback. He watched on as Barty broke a 44-year drought and Alcott was named Australian of the Year. As Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis made doubles sexy again and Alex de Minaur surged into the fourth round of the men’s singles. In one dramatic, euphoric fortnight, Australia’s tennis players helped heal after a cursed couple of years overshadowed by a life-altering pandemic. Part of the combined beauty was the individual variety therein. Barty’s story is one of understated brilliance and relatability. Throughout her early career, the indefinite break from tennis and then rise to world No 1, the 25-year-old has taken her supporters along for the ride. When she arrived at Melbourne Park she was in imposing form. She started and finished her campaign in much the same way. Her problem-solving in the latter stages of her final confirmed she will be one of the greats of this game for some time to come, and the rousing response to Evonne Goolagong Cawley’s surprise appearance once again underpinned her importance as an Indigenous athlete. Barty’s final smashed television records, drawing 4.26 million viewers, while 4.5 million watched the trophy presentation with Goolagong Cawley. This says a lot about the widespread support for Barty but it also provides context to just how many jumped on the Kyrgios and Kokkinakis bandwagon. The pair’s all-Australian men’s doubles final against Matt Ebden and Max Purcell, staged straight after Barty’s final on Saturday, attracted a peak audience of 3.15 million. It is the highest-rating Australian Open men’s doubles match of all time. The Special Ks proved pugnacity can be popular, albeit controversial. Kyrgios, ever the entertainer – even unwittingly – was still racking up the ratings on his Instagram page on Monday, lashing the media for what he saw as a misrepresentation of his post-final comment that “obviously Ash is a hell of a player, but I think the ratings speak for themselves”. He also responded to Purcell’s position that the Special K spectacle may have turned overseas viewers “off tennis a little bit”, calling him a “donut” and adding he “would rather watch paint dry than your S&V [serve and volley] game style”. It is all rather infantile, but therein lies the insatiable hook. Alcott needed none of this to make his impact. A final slam – and a home one at that – before retiring as one of the great Paralympians would have been enough to arrest the national consciousness. Then he went to Canberra and was named Grace Tame’s successor, and used his new platform to call for guaranteed funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and free access to rapid antigen tests for people with disability. Tiley said it was “going to be hard to top it off”. “It is hard to think this happened and everything else that happened and everything else that happened in between,” told the Nine Network on Monday. “An amazing two weeks … we would never dreamed we would end up like we did today. “We hoped. It was a long shot. Rafa came in hoping to play one match. Ash playing at home, always a tremendous amount of pressure. At the very beginning on the first day, I said if there was a situation where it would end up being a dream event at the end, it would be the one we just had. Maybe we are still waking up from that dream.”",Sport/Sport,Australian stars shine to erase off-court drama and create ‘dream’ grand slam,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/31/australian-stars-shine-to-erase-off-court-drama-and-create-dream-grand-slam
1/31/2022,"Small businesses have rejected claims by the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, that a “war chest” of private savings means they no longer need financial support, as the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, increased pressure on the commonwealth for more funding. On Monday Kean ratcheted up attacks on his federal counterpart for not matching the NSW government’s latest $1bn support package, accusing them of leaving small business behind.  “Ash Barty didn’t win the [Australian] Open saying ‘I don’t need to try in the final because I had a good semi’,” he told the ABC. “You have to address each of the challenges as they come along.” Frydenberg earlier argued that federal emergency support should now taper off, and that $245bn in household savings and $179bn in business savings would support the Australia’s economic recovery. “We will continue to provide economic support through various initiatives that we have in place but I do want to move away from those emergency settings,” he said. “We do need to move back to normalised settings, and so therefore off those emergency support payments.” But the Council of Small Businesses Australia (COSBA) chief executive, Alexi Boyd, said most small businesses did not have significant cash reserves, and there was no sign that money was flowing from household savings accounts. “On the ground, it’s not really happening,” Boyd said. “A lot of [small businesses] are treading water when it comes to just being able to make ends meet, just being able to pay wages. “​​There’s talk about there being a lot of cash available in the economy, but for small businesses, they’re not able to make decisions about what the rest of the year looks like because they haven’t had a normal month to base those decisions on. “You only need to go down to the high street and see how many businesses are trading with limited hours because of the worker shortages.” The owner of Sydney’s Jim Jam Music, Kylie Clift, said she was at “breaking point” after two years of uncertainty. She had remained positive until the Omicron wave but she is struggling to see how she will make it through without losing staff due to severe cashflow issues. “It will take me two to three years to recover financially and also just grow those student numbers back up again,” she said. “I’ve been running my business for 16 years … I’m having to kind of go back to the things that I was doing at the beginning to try to drum up business.” She said the situation is so dire she has been feeling like a burden to her husband and kids after being forced to take out loans to cover rising costs. “I know that it’s not my fault, but at the same time it’s really hard for me to get my head around that,” she said. “I feel as if I’m letting them down.” Clift welcomed the state government plan but said more needed to be done by the federal government given the impact of Omicron over the summer. The Australia Institute chief economist, Richard Denniss, criticised Frydenberg’s reasons for not continuing support payments. “He’s literally outsourced fiscal stimulus to high-income Australians,” Denniss said. “He’s hoping that families will go out and spend the government stimulus but lots of them are simply saving up for an overseas holiday in a year or two.” The scaled-down jobsaver-style NSW payment revealed on Sunday aims to support businesses with a turnover of less than $50m that have experienced a 40% drop in turnover in January due to the Omicron wave. It will be capped at half of what was offered during the Delta outbreak last year. Speaking alongside the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, on Monday morning, Kean said he expected a response from Frydenberg after writing to him warning the state’s economy could shrink by 4% if cases rise. “This is such a huge burden that will be borne by our small and medium businesses and they need the commonwealth government’s help now more than ever,” he said. “We want to ensure that small businesses in NSW, particularly those who have been hardest hit – retailers, tourism, hospitality, restaurants, cafes – are able to keep trading.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked if he backed his treasurer’s public row with his federal counterpart, Perrottet said supported Kean fighting every day “for NSW to get further funding”. “When I was treasurer, that’s exactly the approach I took.” ",News/Australia news,‘Treading water’: no sign household savings are flowing to small businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/treading-water-no-sign-household-savings-are-flowing-to-small-businesses
1/31/2022,"Forget any long-term vision, structural changes or philosophy for now; this is a salvage operation first and foremost. Six years of mismanagement, woeful recruitment and illogical decision-making by Farhad Moshiri have taken Everton to the precipice of relegation. The club has not suffered a relegation in 71 years but a team assembled at exorbitant cost are destined for the Championship on current form. Everton collected 10 points from the opening four games before injuries struck Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Rafael Benítez’s divisive reign started to unravel. They have added nine points from the past 16 matches and are the worst-performing team in the Premier League over that extended period.  The two main strikers have returned, albeit rustily in Calvert-Lewin’s case after four months out, but to an error-prone team without confidence, without a clear strategy and with the confusion sown by playing for seven managers in less than six years (caretakers included) reflected in individual performances. Four points above the relegation zone, Everton face a critical test away at Newcastle in their next league game and have Manchester City, Tottenham, West Ham, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Leicester and Arsenal still to play. Frank Lampard needs to instil belief and an effective gameplan immediately. Evertonians are in open, understandable revolt over how Moshiri and the board have not only spurned an opportunity to close the gap on the Premier League elite but driven a wedge between themselves and a team, and managers, that most cannot identify with. The club’s latest farcical managerial search showed what a soap opera Everton have become. The chairman, Bill Kenwright, is understood to have led the initial move for Roberto Martínez, the first manager Moshiri sacked at Everton and who received a payout of more than £10m after a legal dispute. The Royal Belgian Football Association unsurprisingly rejected Everton’s proposal for Martínez to job-share in a World Cup year and the plan quickly floundered. Moshiri, and his business associate Alisher Usmanov, took the lead again and favoured Vítor Pereira, a coach with no Premier League experience who had been overlooked for the Everton manager’s job twice before. The hostile reaction of fans to his candidacy prompted Pereira to pitch his credentials on a live television interview, to widespread astonishment and concern. The move for Pereira, the continued influence of the agent Kia Joorabchian and Moshiri’s recent open letter to supporters – in which he made no acknowledgement of any mistakes on his part and lavishly praised a board also culpable for Everton’s chaotic decline – deepened the fear that the billionaire is blind to the failings that have turned Everton into one of the Premier League’s most dysfunctional clubs. One manager cannot correct their fundamental problems but Lampard will require the strength to ignore interference from above while restoring hope to a disgruntled fanbase. It is a considerable task, but a semblance of unity is needed for the primary objective of avoiding relegation. Get Goodison onside and the old place can act as a spur, not a hindrance, to any Everton player. Duncan Ferguson was “on the floor” after the first game of his second spell as caretaker manager ended in defeat by Aston Villa, but he did oversee improvement in several areas compared with performances under Benítez. Everton had more shots, faced fewer attempts on goal and won more possession against Villa compared with the average under Benítez but lost because of a recurring issue: poor defending at a set piece. Emiliano Buendía’s decisive header was the 10th goal Everton have conceded from a set piece this season, on this occasion as a consequence of Richarlison switching off at the near post. There have been six individual errors leading to goals this term, equalling the amount for the entirety of last season under Carlo Ancelotti. There has not been a settled central defensive partnership all season, largely down to Yerry Mina’s injury problems, the most creative defensive outlet, Lucas Digne, fell out with Benítez and was sold to Villa days before the manager was sacked, and the January recruits Vitalii Mykolenko and Nathan Patterson, signed for an initial total of £29m after long-term interest, did not make Ferguson’s squad. Benítez was the latest Everton manager to question the players’ character – though privately, in his case – with impressive performances on the training ground regularly disappearing on a matchday. Everton’s main assets, and best hope of dragging themselves out of danger, are in attack with Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin, although both have endured injury-hit campaigns and are yet to lift the side since their returns. Demarai Gray, Andros Townsend and Anthony Gordon, two Benítez signings who have impressed and the homegrown talent he introduced regularly to the team, have been Everton’s brightest out-field performers. Behind them, however, Allan and Abdoulaye Doucouré have struggled as a partnership and been frequently overrun. A switch to a three-man midfield with André Gomes would allow Everton to control possession better and reduce their vulnerability to counterattacks – in theory, at least – but that would entail sacrificing a forward. The dilemma has been overtaken by events, however. Doucouré is out for at least a month with a groin problem and his fellow central midfielders Tom Davies and Fabian Delph are also sidelined until March. Benítez had targeted a central midfielder for January. He was loaned the winger Anwar El Ghazi instead. Fortunately for Everton in regards to that area of the pitch, it appears Lampard has persuaded Donny van de Beek to join from Manchester United on a season-long loan deal. As well as staving off relegation and winning over an angry crowd, there is the significant matter of working without a director of football, head of recruitment, manager of scouting, head of sports science and rehabilitation coach. The previous incumbents all left in the past two months.",Sport/Football,"Halt the slide, deal with dysfunction: Frank Lampard’s Everton tick list",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/halt-the-slide-deal-with-dysfunction-frank-lampards-everton-tick-list
1/31/2022,"It’s two years since the UK left the European Union, slightly more than one since it exited the single market and customs union. Yet, as one prominent Brexit supporter has pointed out, no one seems to have starved to death. A low bar, admittedly, but one takes what one can in these pandemic-ravaged times. However, while we may still have food on the shelves, Brexit has already begun to act as a drag on the UK economy. It seems clear this will persist, though it’s less clear as to what implications this will have for the ongoing Brexit debate. Think back to the febrile atmosphere of the referendum and its aftermath. There was plenty of loose talk on all sides. Claims such as the £350m on the bus or George Osborne’s warning of the need for an emergency budget in the event of a vote to leave were generally overblown. And remainer rhetoric provided an opening for Brexiters. In response to 2017 warnings about a Brexit “cliff edge”, a spokesperson for the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies remarked acidly that “according to project fear we should be holed up in a post-apocalyptic wasteland in threadbare clothes eating tinned food by now”.  Yet Brexit was already beginning to bite. Well before the date of departure, work by John Springford at the Centre for European Reform showed that UK GDP was lagging behind its expected level. By September 2021, he had concluded that UK goods trade was 11.2%, or £8.5bn, lower than it would have been had the UK stayed in the EU’s single market and customs union. Indeed, one reason the much-vaunted “cliff edge” failed to materialise is that we have been slithering down it for a while, and consequently have less far to fall. And this is starting to hit home. Ian Mulheirn at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change has made the point that recent tax rises – £29bn of extra taxes are pencilled in to be introduced by the government by 2025 – would not have been necessary had the UK remained in the EU. Brexit is forecast to have a net cost to the public finances of around £30bn a year. So why aren’t we talking more about this? Well, for a number of reasons, but first and foremost the pandemic. Covid has drowned out everything else and has been an easy scapegoat for all economic disruption. It has also meant that much economic activity that would have been – and will be – affected by Brexit (think of service providers travelling to the EU to sell their wares) has been paused. So, what is still to come? Trade will become more difficult: it is only in July that the British government will finally institute the remainder of the checks necessitated under the terms of its trade deal with the EU. And over the longer term, the OBR has estimated the aggregate impact on UK GDP to be 4%. Our estimates at the UK in a Changing Europe are slightly higher, at between 5.8% (under a liberal migration policy scenario) and 7% (under a more restrictive regime). What, then, of claims that Brexit provides us with opportunities to recoup these losses via trade deals and more effective domestic regulation? The former seems hopelessly optimistic, given not only the impact of geography on trade but also the limited nature of the deal so far signed with Australia. While there are indeed possibilities for the UK to regulate more effectively than the EU, particularly in emergent areas of economic activity such as robotics or AI, these gains have yet to be secured, and as things stand it is impossible to see how they could compensate for the scale of the negative impact generated by falling trade with the EU. Brexit, of course, has shaped far more than our economy. It has also been central to a political realignment that eventually saw Boris Johnson elected at the head of an 80-seat majority, with his leave-voting coalition including large numbers of traditional Labour voters. Yet there have been recent signs that this coalition may not be as robust as it first appeared. More than half of people now think Brexit has had a negative impact on the supply of food and goods, while 51% think it has adversely affected the cost of living, including more than a third of leave voters. Overall, 57% of Britons think the government is doing a bad job of handling Brexit. Just under half say the same on handling the economy – the worst rating for a government since 2013. Indeed, for the first time, Johnson is thought to be doing a bad job among leave voters. After he won the “Brexit election” in December 2019, 74% of leave voters said Johnson was doing a good job. As the pandemic hit, in April 2020, that rose to 86%. Now, that number of leave voters who have a positive view of the prime minister has fallen to 36%. Brexit, then, may not be the electoral catnip it once was. As its effects persist, and particularly as Covid recedes, it is at least conceivable that more and more people come to link the decision to leave the EU with the economic problems confronting them at home. And while, as the Financial Times’ Peter Foster put it, “It’s angina, not a heart attack”, living with angina long term can be an unpleasant experience. This is far from implying an appetite to reopen the process, still less to think in terms of rejoining. But it does speak to the unpredictability of Brexit’s political effects.

1/31/2022,"When the pandemic first hit the world, Zimbabwean stone sculptor David Ngwerume took his hammer and chisel and started work on the first of a collection of Covid-inspired pieces. Almost two years and 14 sculptures later, one has made its way to China after being selected for the ninth Beijing International Art Biennale, an exhibition showcasing work from thousands of artists from more than 100 countries.  The piece, Unto the Third Wave, depicts a woman receiving a vaccine for Covid-19 from a pair of suspended hands. Ngwerume created it in June last year, just before a third wave of the pandemic hit the country. “When I heard a third wave was coming, I called it Unto the Third Wave. I was encouraging people – let’s get vaccinated, let’s get ready for everything that is coming, and for variants,” he says. Omicron has prevented Ngwerume, who also has his own law practice, from accompanying his sculpture to China, but at home in Harare, he remains determined to continue adding to his Covid collection. His ambition is to produce and exhibit 25 to 30 sculptures. Ngwerume started sculpting while still at school in Musana, north-east of Harare, under the tutelage of sculptor Cosmos Muchenje. He loved the idea of sculptures being widely visible and thinks they can better portray a message than a painting that has to remain indoors. Stone sculpting has a long tradition in Zimbabwe and Ngwerume collects different materials from quarries and mines around the country. It was his father who inspired him to practise law and do art at the same time. Ngwerume was academically gifted and it was always his ambition to pursue a profession. “My father used to encourage me to do both,” he says. “He told me: ‘You cannot be a good artist without academic qualifications, you will end up failing to grasp how the world is moving’.” Now Ngwerume makes sculptures from his home studio. The idea for the Covid collection was born in the early stages of the pandemic, when Ngwerume found himself thinking about what people were experiencing and how to reflect that through his art. “Covid-19 was facing people in all parts of the world. It is a humanitarian catastrophe and nonselective between rich and poor, black and white, Muslims and Christians … it was cutting through everything that divides humanity,” he says. “I felt inspired [and thought about] what role I should play to bring awareness, to inspire the world. How can we fight this pandemic together and how can we see ourselves through?” Ngwerume’s first sculpture from his self-financed collection is a figure of a woman wearing a mask. After vaccines were created, he did a sculpture called Arms – a half-torso with a pair of suspended arms holding an injection. He explains: “The reason why it’s a half is because I didn’t want it to be perceived as a gender. I wanted it to resonate with everybody.” He’s also created a sculpture called Hygiene, which shows two hands washing. “My ambition was to move with the world, play my part and pass messages into the world,” says Ngwerume. His work has attracted international attention, beyond the Beijing biennale, and has been featured in various media outlets. “There was no artist doing something like that and it was speaking to the times,” he says. Ngwerume’s ultimate dream is to see his work exhibited around the world, including at the World Health Organization’s headquarters in Geneva. “Coming from a small country in Africa, I’m unnoticed and unrecognised and I wonder if that will happen,” he says. “Maybe it will just be a wish. I’m not going to stop what I’m doing even if I end up exhibiting at my house and even if the galleries will not look at me.” He adds: “I will keep going, my spirit keeps soaring.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘I wanted my art to resonate’: The Zimbabwean sculptor responding to Covid with creativity,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/31/i-wanted-my-art-to-resonate-the-zimbabwean-sculptor-responding-to-covid-with-creativity
