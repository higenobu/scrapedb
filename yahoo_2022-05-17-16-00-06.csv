5/17/2022,"Elon Musk's excuse about Twitter bots is a way to back out of the deal, Wedbush said. Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion but could be feeling pressure amid falling Tesla stock. ""We view the $44 billion Twitter deal as having less than a 50% [chance] to get done,"" Wedbush said. There is now a less than 50% chance that Elon Musk will acquire Twitter for $44 billion, a Monday note from Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, said. Musk, who plans to put up a big chunk of his Tesla stake to finance the Twitter buyout, raised concerns last week about the proliferation of bots on the social-media platform, adding that until his concern was sorted out, the deal would be on hold. Musk's sudden concern about bots sent Twitter shares plunging 10% on Friday. Ives said he viewed Musk's concern about bots as a ""dog ate the homework"" excuse that the billionaire could use to either back out of the deal or lower the price of his proposed buyout, $54.20 a share. ""Our view is while Musk is committed to the deal the massive pressure on Tesla's stock since the deal, a changing stock market/risk environment the last month, and a number of other financing factors has caused Musk to get 'cold feet' on the Twitter deal with the bot issue not a new issue and likely more of a scapegoat to push for a lower price,"" Wedbush said. Bots have always been a concern for Twitter, but Jack Dorsey, the platform's founder and former CEO, largely cleared up much of the bot issue over the past few years, according to Ives. But Musk's apparent pause on the deal until he is comfortable with the bot situation puts Twitter between a rock and a hard place, as no other strategic or financial bidder has stepped forward and matched Musk's offer for the company. ""And Musk knows that, which is why in a changing market and with Tesla losing ~$300 billion of market cap since the deal we view the $44 billion Twitter deal as having less than a 50% [chance] to get done as of today,"" Ives said. If the deal doesn't get done, Twitter will collect a $1 billion breakup fee, but that's still not going to prevent the stock from plunging to below $30, Ives said. ""Musk is still committed to the deal per his tweets and appears like he wants to get it done, but the financing stress and equity financing overhang on his golden child Tesla has cast a long shadow on this deal,"" Ives said. Tesla's stock popped more than 5% on Friday as investors likely warmed to the idea of Musk not going through with his deal to buy Twitter, which would make him less likely to sell a big chunk of his shares. ""The bot issue at the end of the day was known by the New York City cab driver and feels more to us like the 'dog ate the homework' excuse to bail on the Twitter deal or talk down a lower price,"" Ives said.

5/17/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -White, brightly burning munitions were shown cascading down on the Azovstal steel works in the Ukrainian port of Mariupol in what a British military expert said looked like either an attack with phosphorus or incendiary weapons. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said ""delicate"" negotiations were proceeding on rescuing Ukrainian servicemen holed up beneath the vast complex. A Ukrainian officer among the remaining defenders said 600 fighters remained, 40 of them seriously injured. Civilians have been evacuated from the labyrinth of bunkers. Reuters was not able to immediately identify the type of munitions being used on the Azovstal complex or when the video was taken. It was posted on Sunday on the Telegram messaging application by Alexander Khodakovsky, a commander of the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk. ""If you didn't know what it is and for what purpose - you could say that it's even beautiful,"" Khodakovsky said in a message beside the video. Khodakovsky could not be immediately reached for comment. It was not immediately clear which forces had fired the munitions, or from where. NOT ENOUGH MEDICINE OR SURGICAL EQUIPMENT Denys Shlega, a commander of Ukraine's National Guard, described conditions beneath the plant as dire. ""There is not enough medicine or surgical equipment,"" Shlega told Ukrainian television. ""At the moment, we have about 600 people who are injured. About 40 in a very serious condition."" Shlega said Russian forces had penetrated into parts of the steel plant ""but this is not yet significant and we are holding on ... holding on with our last forces."" Russian forces have pummeled Mariupol for nearly two months. Russia has not commented on what specific weapons it has used to attack the plant. The Russian defence ministry did not reply to a written request for comment about the video. Ukraine's armed forces declined to make an immediate official comment. The prosecutor's office said it had launched an investigation into possible use of incendiary weapons. White phosphorus munitions can be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings. White phosphorus is not banned as a chemical weapon under international conventions. Human rights groups have urged a ban on the use of phosphorus munitions because of the severe burns they cause. The United States used phosphorus munitions in the Vietnam war and the 2003-2011 Iraq war. Russia used them in the Chechen wars. Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to Mariupol's mayor, said that Russia had used incendiary or phosphorous bombs on Azovstal. Andryushchenko was speaking from Ukrainian-controlled territory. Reuters was unable to immediately verify his comments. Hamish Stephen de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of Britain's Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said it looked very much like phosphorus in the video, but only a sample could give absolute confirmation. ""It does look very much like white phosphorus rockets or artillery shells which are exploding just above the ground or upon the ground,"" he told Reuters.
