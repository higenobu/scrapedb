3/25/2022,"The UK government is taking legal steps to override the Northern Ireland executive and directly instruct the nation’s health trusts to provide abortion services, saying it will “take the necessary powers” to directly commission services if urgent progress is not made. The secretary for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, set out the UK government’s legislative options in strong language on Thursday, after it became “increasingly clear” that the Northern Ireland Department of Health (NI DoH) will miss the end of March deadline to fully commission abortion services in the country. Lewis said in a written ministerial statement that planned regulations would “remove the need for executive committee approval before services can be commissioned”, which has been a major obstacle to the provision of abortions. Terminations have been legal in Northern Ireland since 2019, but services have not been commissioned and individual clinicians have worked to provide a piecemeal service. A high court judge ruled in October last year that Lewis had failed to uphold his duties to provide full abortion services in Northern Ireland after a judicial review was brought by a woman who was told to travel to England for an abortion during the pandemic. “Women and girls must have access to safe, high-quality abortion care in Northern Ireland as they do everywhere else in the UK,” Lewis said. “It has become increasingly clear the Northern Ireland Department of Health will fail to commission abortion services in full by the deadline I set out last year despite being given every opportunity to do so.” Lewis said he was setting up a “small team” in the Northern Ireland Office to work directly with the NI DoH, adding that he would have the “powers to intervene directly following the assembly elections in May, if sufficient progress has still not been made”. Abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019 after a Westminster vote led by the Labour MP Stella Creasy took advantage of a paralysed Stormont, despite an 11th-hour attempt by the region’s assembly to block change. Officials confirmed inApril 2020 that terminations could go ahead after pro-choice campaigners threatened to take legal action over alleged attempts to stall their provision. Creasy, whose amendment paved the way for the change in the law, said on Thursday that women in Northern Ireland had been waiting for equal access to their human rights for three years. “It is now imperative that the government confirm the timetable for action and what sanctions they will use should anyone try to prevent progress in delivering services to ensure that there is no further delay,” she said. The Northern Ireland chief commissioner for human rights, Alyson Kilpatrick, welcomed the step, but stressed that the secretary of state was under a statutory duty to act quickly, and said the organisation was concerned about a lack of deadline. “In 2022, women and girls in Northern Ireland are still faced with deplorable options, including having to travel to England to access abortion services, being forced to continue a pregnancy against their wishes or take unregulated abortion pills,” she said.",News/UK news,UK government preparing to override Northern Ireland on abortion services,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/24/uk-government-to-override-northern-ireland-on-abortion-services
3/25/2022,"The US is on course to be named in mid-May as host of the 2031 men’s Rugby World Cup and the women’s event in 2033 with a bid priced at half a billion dollars and support from the Biden White House, executives including World Rugby chief Alan Gilpin said on Thursday. “We’re not talking to anybody else about Rugby World Cup hosting in 2031 and 2033,” Gilpin said. “It doesn’t mean it’s a done deal … but it means that we strategically believe we can deliver the right outcomes with this hosting plan.” Australia is in similar dialogue regarding the men’s event in 2027. Asked about reports of problems, Gilpin said: “The short answer is there’ll be more news to come in the next couple of weeks. “We’re down in Australia from the end of next week, addressing the outstanding issues with with our friends at Rugby Australia. So there’ll be more to come on that. In terms of contingencies, yes, lots of conversations going on around who’s capable of hosting and when and again, those are very strategic conversations rather than a competitive bid process. “So [Australia] are our preferred candidate for 2027 and we expect to be in good shape in the discussions with them.” For the US bid, which has shifted from an initial model of hosting the women in 2029 to the hope that a successful men’s event can drive engagement, the next big date is 12 May, when the World Rugby council will meet. Gilpin spoke to reporters alongside Ross Young, chief executive of USA Rugby, the US bid chair, Jim Brown, and Emily Bydwell, US representative to the World Rugby Women’s Advisory Group. Gilpin said: “The guys absolutely are making sure that we’ve got the different stakeholders from government through to city and state aligned as much as you can have this far out, and behind that we’ve got the confidence there that if we award these tournaments to the US, we’re on the right track. “From my point of view, we stand up in front of all of the council on 12 May and we sell them the vision … and we give them the confidence that the numbers work and that the infrastructure and the the ingredients to deliver the plan are there. And then we move forward. And of course the really hard work starts on 13 May. “This is just the end of the beginning. There’s a lot to do.” The US men’s team have a lot to do on the field, having shipped 104 points to the All Blacks in October and needing to beat Chile to secure a place at the World Cup in France next year. Domestically, a professional competition, Major League Rugby, is in its fifth year. Gilpin said on Thursday preparations for a US World Cup in 2031 would most likely include top international and club teams being brought in to play American opposition or each other, in an attempt to broaden the domestic audience. Bydwell said women’s rugby was “really at an inflection point right now globally and in the US”, and pointed to the launch next year of WXV, a World Rugby event which will place international teams in three tiers for annual competition to develop depth. Brown put the cost of the joint bid between World Rugby and USA Rugby at around half a billion dollars. USA Rugby recently emerged from bankruptcy. Young and Gilpin said costs, profits and losses would be shared. “We’re actually taking from a World Rugby perspective more risk,” Gilpin said. “But it’s calculated risk and it’s about using the events to drive growth. We therefore require less certainty and less risk-taking commitment from from a host … and that’s allowed us, particularly with USA Rugby, to have a different type of discussion.” US-hosted Rugby World Cups would use NFL, college and MLS stadiums. Brown said: “We have upwards of 28 cities interested in potentially hosting the Rugby World Cup, not only in ’31 but also ’33. We have great relationship with government. We have great relationships with stadiums and over 30 potential stadiums interested.” Last week, Gilpin toured Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado, home of the Broncos in NFL and a potential World Cup venue. Federal support was expressed earlier this month via a bipartisan resolution from the Congressional Rugby Caucus. “The catchphrase that goes with the bid is being United by Rugby,” Young said, referring to the American game as much as to political divides. “This is a big old geography, there are a number of different stakeholders that just aren’t as aligned as they should be for the growth of the game. So this is the opportunity to do that, to do that background work and create a plan that’s measurable and accountable.” Asked if government support extended to the White House, where resides a self-proclaimed rugby player and fan, Joe Biden, Brown said: “We’re in regular dialogue with the White House and the deliverables related to meeting the requirements of hosting. “There is support at the White House for both ’31 and ’33. All the guarantees that are required, namely, obviously visa and entry, tax-related requirements, and just general support from the government have been positive so far.” Federal and state governments would also be involved in security arrangements. “The expectation,” Brown said, “is to have a formal letter sent to World Rugby from the White House, which is also well on track and should be delivered by by next week, confirming a full commitment by the federal government, which obviously then impacts state and city commitments as well. “I think in this case, we have a unique situation of two [tournaments] which has been especially attractive to at least the staff of the White House that we’ve worked with.”",Sport/Sport,USA on course to be named Rugby World Cup host in 2031 and 2033 in May,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/usa-rugby-world-cup-host-2031-2033-may-half-billion-dollars-biden-white-house
3/25/2022,"It’s not pushing a point too hard to suggest Wales don’t have the greatest record at the World Cup. It’s 1958 – and that’s it. Having said that, they did get to the quarter-finals that year, and may well have won the whole thing had John Charles not been kicked out of the competition. Also, in the process, they scored the greatest goal in the entire history of the whole goddamn thing. Ivor Allchurch, boneddigion a boneddigesau, knocking Diego Maradona, Carlos Alberto, Maxi Rodríguez, Dennis Bergkamp, Esteban Cambiasso, Archie Gemmill, Saeed Al-Owairan, Michael Owen and Marco Tardelli into a jauntily-cocked hat.

However, 64 years of hurt could soon come to an end, with Wales just two games away from making it to the Ethics World Cup in Popularity’s Qatar this November. Austria provide the first hurdle to be cleared, tonight in Cardiff, and while the erstwhile wunderteam boast some fine talent in David Alaba, Marcel Sabitzer and Marko Arnautovic, there are reasons to be optimistic. Aaron Ramsey is playing regular football again, sort of, at Ibrox, while Gareth Bale has got his handicap down to 3.1 and is really dialling in his short irons at the moment. Even if Ramsey and Bale manage to add to their combined total of 56 international goals this evening and make it through, it’s not clear where or when or against whom they’ll play any final eliminator. Tonight’s victors are slated to face the winner of the tie between Scotland and Ukraine, which, well, y’know. But that’s a problem for another day/few months, so Wales are understandably concentrating on the task in front of them right now. “We can draw on past experiences that have hurt us,” says Bale, referencing the aforementioned Jordan and Bodin fiascos, plus the time he was two up with three holes to play against Harry Redknapp but couldn’t close it out. Here’s to Gareth getting the job done tonight, despite having played only six minutes of football in the last nine years.

3/25/2022,"Russian and Ukrainian environmental activists have made a joint call for a European embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal, as children and young people prepare to take part in the latest wave of climate crisis school strikes and protests around the world. Arina Bilai, 16, of Fridays for Future Ukraine, and Arshak Makichyan, 27, of Fridays for Future Russia, said a ban on trade in fossil fuels from Russia would starve its invasion of Ukraine of crucial funds, while accelerating Europe’s transition to clean energy. “We have now a problem, we have a huge problem. We have war,” Bilai said, who had fled Kyiv for Warsaw earlier this month. “The war is happening right in Europe, and Europe is sponsoring it. Europe sends €700m a day to Russia. It’s like fuelling war, it’s exactly like fuelling war.” Bilai was part of a delegation of young activists from Ukraine, Poland and Hungary who had travelled to Brussels to meet politicians at special Nato and EU council summits. “We are here in Brussels, because we demand [an] embargo,” she said. “And we demand strong action [by the] European Union against trading and investment in Russia and investment in fossil fuels.” Makichyan this week fled to Europe to avoid a crackdown on anti-war protesters after he spoke out against the invasion of Ukraine. He arrived in Berlin two days ago. He said Europe’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels had financed Vladimir Putin’s repressive government. “Our government was using this money not only to buy yachts [and] build palaces but also for munitions for the police, to beat up civil society in Russia for years, or to arrest us, to kill Russian civil society people. And they are using this money to buy arms for upcoming wars,” he said. Bilai and Makichyan spoke on an online joint briefing arranged by the Global Strategic Communications Council, a philanthropically funded public relations network that helps climate scientists and campaigners promote their work. Their call came ahead of plans for a wave of climate strikes on Friday, with activists saying they expect more than 1,000 actions worldwide. A map on the Fridays For Future website listed about 700, including more than 300 in Europe and about 160 in North America, 80 in Africa and the Middle East, nearly 40 in South America and more than 100 in Oceania. Although events in Ukraine proved impossible to ignore, the protests were slated to march under the slogan “people not profit” and a statement linking climate breakdown with capitalism and colonialism. In Europe, big events were expected in Brussels, and also in Berlin, Germany, where more activists from Ukraine and others from Uganda, were to attend. But in the UK, response the call out was muted. An interactive map listed 36 strikes across the four nations, but most appeared to be registered by dedicated enthusiasts rather than mass organisations. The Guardian was unable to reach any organisers of UK events. Thirty actions were planned in the US, with the biggest expected in Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, Liv Schroeder, of Fridays For Future USA, said. She also said mobilising people had been difficult after the pandemic. The school strike movement started in August 2019 when Greta Thunberg, then 15, held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Since then 116 million people had taken part in 143,000 strikes in 213 countries, according to data collected by Fridays For Future. Three years ago, 1.4 million people worldwide took part in one Friday strike.",News/Environment,Russian and Ukrainian activists call for European embargo on Russian fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/russian-and-ukrainian-activists-call-for-european-embargo-on-russian-fossil-fuels
3/25/2022,"Ocado is redesigning a new logo for its fast-track Zoom service less than a week after it was launched, after drawing comparisons to the Russian battle symbol used on tanks and other military vehicles in Ukraine. The online grocer unveiled the logo, featuring a white swishy Z on a pink circle background, last Friday. But on Thursday, the company said it was having a rethink after its design quickly drew comparisons with the “Zwastika”. One campaign group flagged the logo on Twitter alongside a Ukraine flag. It tweeted: “What a time to launch a rebrand using a white ‘Z’.” Another observer said it was “not a great time for Z brands”. Emily M Austen, the founder and chief executive of of the PR agency Emerge, told The Grocer trade journal, which first reported the logo change: “It’s not usually the longest page in a brand briefing document but ‘avoidance of invasion based logo likeness’ is usually a given.” Ocado said on Thursday: “In light of current circumstances we are making a small change to an icon ahead of our upcoming Zoom by Ocado rebrand.” A spokesperson added: “Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people and everyone impacted by Russia’s invasion of their country. The human tragedy unfolding in Ukraine, and the refugee crisis along its borders, has shocked the world. “As an organisation, we have contributed £150,000 to the DEC Ukraine crisis appeal to help provide food, first aid, shelter, medicine, clothes and other aid to those most in need.” The issue is the latest embarrassment for Ocado after the company drew criticism for its association with Marks & Spencer, its joint-venture partner on grocery deliveries in the UK, whose 48-store franchisee in Russia continues to operate despite the British brand suspending shipments. Most western brands are distancing themselves from Moscow by closing stores and halting manufacturing, although change is more difficult for those with franchise partners. The latest move came from the Marlboro cigarettes manufacturer, Philip Morris International, which said on Thursday that it was working on options to exit the Russian market as it had become too complex to do business there. The company, which booked about 6% of its total revenues from Russia last year, said it had discontinued the sale of several cigarette products and cancelled all product launches this year. The company has also scaled down manufacturing in the country but said its 3,200 employees in Russia would continue to be paid.",News/Business,Ocado to redesign Zoom logo after it draws ‘Zwastika’ comparisons,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/24/ocado-redesign-zoom-logo-z-russian-forces-ukraine
3/25/2022,"The rightwing presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse has promised to rewrite the French constitution in order to fight crime and illegal immigration, as she tried to boost a flagging campaign that risks her party imploding if she fails to reach the final round next month. “I want to show that I’m ready to govern,” Pécresse told journalists in Paris, vowing to “restore order to the streets and to the public accounts”. Shortly afterwards, Pécresse’s team announced she had Covid and would be stepping back from public appearances for the next few days. Polls this week showed Pécresse sinking into a damaging fifth position. The mood is palpably tense in Les Républicains, the traditional rightwing party of Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, which could break apart amid ideological in-fighting if Pécresse does not make it to the second round final on 24 April. An Ipsos poll for France Info and Le Parisien this week placed Pécresse as low as 9.5% in the 10 April first round, far behind the centrist president Emmanuel Macron, on 29.5%, and the far-right Marine Le Pen, on 18.5%, who are predicted to make the final. Pécresse has also sunk behind the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, on 12.5%, as he gains ground, and the far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour, on 11%. In Paris, Pécresse was asked about voters preferring the far-right to her programme, no matter how much she hardens her stance on immigration. She said: “My programme is more precise than theirs, it has all the fundamentals to end illegal immigration.” She said the aim now was to fight against abstentionism and to win over voters by arguing for her party’s experience and budgetary rigour. Pécresse said her changes to the constitution would introduce minimum prison sentences for some crimes, quotas for immigration, and limit the Muslim headscarf in some public spaces, including banning headscarves from players in sporting events. No headscarves would be worn by mothers accompanying schooltrips, she said. She referred to her own clampdown on full-body swimsuits as head of the Île-de-France region, which includes Paris and the surrounding area, saying: “There will be no burkinis in the swimming pools of the Republic.” Pécresse is trying to stop party sympathisers choosing Macron, whose programme covers similar ground to hers on certain issues, including raising the retirement age to 65. Éric Ciotti, a party hardliner who had run against Pécresse in Les Républicains’ internal primary race, declined to answer a question on the health of his party, saying: “I’ll respond to that on the day of the first round.” But he added that the debate “is still open” in the presidential race. “It’s not all wrecked for the right,” Xavier Bertrand, another former rival in the primary race, told French radio this week, saying the last 10 days of the campaign would be crucial. Olivier Rouquan, of Paris University’s centre for administrative and political sciences, said: “It’s clear that if Les Républicains don’t get to the second round of the presidential election, it will be hard to avoid an implosion.” He said that a number of lawmakers for the party might be tempted to jump to Macron’s camp in order to secure re-election in the June parliamentary elections. “There will be a recomposition of the right and some of Les Républicains will take part in that, but not as we know the party – another political force will emerge … The party will be weakened if Valérie Pécresse doesn’t get to the second round.” He said Pécresse’s difficulties began with the fact that she won her party’s primary by a narrow margin so was having to accommodate competing party views. Added to this, the far-right Le Pen was holding the centre of gravity on the right in the polls. Pécresse was also struggling to “embody” the campaign and place her ideas at the centre of the public debate.",News/World news,French rightwing candidate focuses on immigration as she slips to fifth in polls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/french-rightwing-candidate-focuses-on-immigration-as-she-slips-to-fifth-in-polls
3/25/2022,"If movies didn’t need to be publicised in advance, audiences would be able to go into Fresh feeling entirely, well, fresh. They could spend the first half-hour savouring this wry take on the frustrations of modern dating, starring Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan, without realising that the film was about to morph from Sleepless in Seattle into Saw. At least the director, Mimi Cave, has one trick that feels subtly disorienting even if you know it’s coming: she withholds the opening credits until the 33-minute mark. This delineates the two contrasting parts of the movie, while also expressing on a structural level the idea that something is very wrong. If this is the beginning of the film, then what exactly have we been watching until now? Anyone who has gone the distance with Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s Oscar-nominated Drive My Car will know the feeling. I saw the film in a crowded cinema where there were ripples of discombobulation when the opening titles appeared after 40 minutes or so. Back in the days of celluloid, there was always the possibility that the reels had been lined up in the wrong order, so it was amusing now to see those old analogue habits kick in, a few of us swivelling around in our seats to grimace at the projection booth. In reorganising the basic furniture of cinema, Cave and Hamaguchi bring a new kind of tension to the art of the opening sequence. Acclaim has always tended to settle disproportionately on those openers that exhibit clear technical prowess, such as the single-take shots that launch Touch of Evil, The Player and Johnnie To’s Breaking News. The last of those starts with a ferocious six-minute battle on the streets of Hong Kong, during which the camera rises repeatedly to sniper-level before returning to a worm’s-eye view of the melee. Even mild bewilderment can be enough to snag our attention, as it is during the nearly wordless opening of Billy Wilder’s 1972 comedy Avanti! Why on earth has Jack Lemmon persuaded a stranger to swap clothes with him in the cramped bathroom on a flight to Italy? Seven minutes later, the lira drops. A serene spectacle can also work on an audience like hypnosis. There are no bombs, bullets or bathroom shenanigans in the eight-and-a-half-minute opening shot of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s Flowers of Shanghai. The camera gazes sleepily at the various garrulous figures crowded around the candlelit parlour table in a 19th-century brothel. Tea is poured, games played, fans elegantly opened – and we’re hooked. The options for an effective opening sequence are numerous, but what makes a truly great one? “The most successful openings are the ones that raise an audience’s curiosity or interest as opposed to providing them with information,” says the veteran editor Paul Hirsch. “But you have to be careful. There’s a difference between piquing someone’s curiosity and confusing them.” Hirsch won an Oscar for his work on Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope), though he wouldn’t single out the beginning of that picture as an example to follow. “Star Wars opens with this crawl of rolling text on the screen. I always thought if we hadn’t had that, people would still have understood what was going on. I don’t think the best way to start a movie is to dump a load of information in the audience’s lap.” More innovative are the 11 pictures Hirsch cut for Brian De Palma, including Sisters, Carrie and Blow Out. De Palma reserves a special contempt for directors who waste those precious opening minutes. “When you start a movie with a helicopter shot of Manhattan, or these boring drive-up shots showing a car driving up to a building – I mean, this is not an idea,” he said in 2010. “Especially the beginning of a movie when the audience is ready for anything. To waste that time with some boring geography shot mystifies me.” Hirsch recalls De Palma telling him: “If I ever shoot a drive-up, shoot me.” Sisters begins with a man watching a blind woman start to undress after mistakenly entering a male changing room; Blow Out starts with a long point-of-view shot from the perspective of a killer. Neither sequence is quite what it seems – the first turns out to be an excerpt from a Candid Camera-style television show, the second a fake horror movie called Co-Ed Frenzy. De Palma has staged more complicated opening sequences (Snake Eyes begins with a roaming 13-minute shot which introduces the dramatis personae and sets up the plot’s central conspiracy) but it is his tactic of pulling the rug from under our feet when we have barely stepped through the front door that is so playful and pleasurable. Many of Hirsch’s best opening sequences – he also edited Falling Down, which begins with Michael Douglas growing increasingly tense in a Los Angeles traffic jam – run for around five or six minutes. Is this the optimum time for a good opener, equivalent to the classic three-minute pop song? “I haven’t thought about it,” he says, with a shrug. “A sequence will tell you how long it needs to be. When you’re cutting, you keep going back to it and playing ‘What’s wrong with this picture?’ until you can’t find anything wrong any more.” One advantage of a lengthy opening sequence is that it’s well-placed to create a narrative pause before the film proper begins. Think of the heart-breaking prologue in the Pixar animation Up, which compresses 80-odd years into 11 minutes, or the relationship that flares into life before dying out in the 18-minute opening of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Back in fashion today is the sort of lengthy introductory flashback found more than 30 years ago in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. That giddy eight-minute opening shows how the film’s hero (played in his teens by River Phoenix) acquired his fear of snakes, his proficiency with a bullwhip, the scar on his chin and the fedora on his head. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King starts with a flashback to the fateful day when Sméagol (Andy Serkis) began his transition into the monstrous Gollum. The most recent version of Death on the Nile begins by explaining why the Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) first cultivated his distinctive moustache, making the film not just a whodunit but a why-grow-it. The most unorthodox use of the extended opening sequence in recent mainstream cinema was in No Time to Die. Though not the first James Bond film in which the hero is absent from the prologue (that honour goes to Live and Let Die), it is the only one to begin with a flashback to a supporting character’s childhood. Bond fans are accustomed to waiting an eternity for the opening credits sequence, but No Time to Die outstripped its predecessors: 24 minutes elapse before the title appears on screen. It is only in this century that directors have truly begun to exploit the power of withholding that traditional marker of commencement. The credits for Benjamín Naishtat’s Rojo (2018), a tale of political turmoil in mid-1970s Argentina, don’t appear until 23 minutes in. “Starting the credits ‘late’ is so Brechtian,” says the film critic Charlotte O’Sullivan. “If a rule is tweaked, you naturally start to think about why it exists at all, which is a train of thought you suspect the directors of Rojo and Drive My Car would both applaud. After all, Drive My Car is about the need to do things differently – its hero stages Uncle Vanya in different languages – while Rojo is about the insidious effect of following rules blindly without thinking [about] whose interests they serve.” A break or indentation of this kind also invites us to catch our breath. “Delaying the credits can be a way of creating an intermission,” says O’Sullivan. “That seems such an old-fashioned idea. But it’s bliss to have a moment to process information when there’s a lot to digest.” If the structural oddness of Fresh and Drive My Car catches on, that sweet spot between 30 and 45 minutes could become the new normal for opening titles. Apichatpong Weerasethakul got there first, waiting three-quarters of an hour before running the credits for his enigmatic 2002 drama Blissfully Yours; Yoshihiro Nishimura followed suit in his grisly Helldriver (2010). No one seems to have gone quite as far as the Japanese provocateur Sion Sono: the titles in his indescribably madcap fantasy-horror-comedy-thriller Love Exposure (2008) fall at the 58-minute mark, with another three hours of action still to go. Of course, the original 1940 roadshow cut of Disney’s Fantasia dispensed with the convention entirely, which begs a philosophical question: if a film has no opening titles, has it ever really begun?  Fresh is on Disney+.

At least the chancellor had the good grace to abandon the words “levelling up” and “net zero”, and he barely even mentioned “pensioners” as he impoverished the already poor while giving a little bonus to gas-guzzling SUV drivers. Why be shocked? God knows how many Tory budgets and mini-budgets I have covered in a lifetime mostly ruled by Tory governments, yet still, somehow, I can be taken by surprise. The sheer naked venality in pleasing their own still takes my breath away. Surely a chancellor wouldn’t choose to do the wrong things, knowingly, purposefully, when he has the power to set the country in a better direction? How pathetically naive to think that Sunak would choose to ensure the blow doesn’t again fall hardest on the weakest, as we face the worst hit to our living standards in our lifetimes after the triple blows of financial crash, pandemic and war. I did expect at least a token gesture. After all the years of George Osborne budgets, the effects of which I chronicled with David Walker in our book, The Lost Decade, what idiocy on my part to hold on to a scintilla of belief that the Tories wouldn’t keep doing the same thing over and over again. “We can’t do everything” is the chancellor’s mantra, to go alongside blaming Putin for all the cumulative damage done since 2010. It sounds grownup and responsible, and it’s how Tory chancellors have deceived the public ever since Margaret Thatcher compared the national economy to a household budget and Osborne cleverly said the country has “maxed out its credit card”. Of course a chancellor can’t do everything! Let’s leave aside the macro-economic questions of how he could, of course, borrow more with a Bank of England quantitative easing programme that invests in everything that would deliver green growth. But within his self-imposed limits, the choices he made are obscene, as were Osborne’s. Food banks are flooded with families in need for the first time; court proceedings to evict tenants in England due to rent default are up by 43%; and the managing director of Iceland says food bank users are turning down raw food since they have no money to pay for the energy to cook it. The chancellor’s own Office for Budget Responsibility spelled out to him with brutal honesty how much worse things will get this year. But still the poorest fifth of households are set to receive just £120, with the richest pocketing £480. His disreputable priority is to stash most cash in a pre-election war chest – sweeteners and bribes to win another term that would again reward the haves and knock back the have-nots. However, maybe that’s not going too well this time judging by the response from the usually sycophantic Tory press. Even the Express front page on Thursday splashed, “The forgotten millions say: what about us?”, protesting at less than nothing for the old, whose state pensions will only increase by 3.1% despite inflation predicted to reach 8%, all while facing soaring energy and food bills. That’s odd, because the Tories rely absolutely on the pensioner vote. No doubt they’ll get their bung in election year – but will they be too disgruntled by then? The Telegraph blasts, “The biggest fall in living standards on record” and even the Mail struggles to find positives, their front page demanding, “Now slash taxes even further” – angry that Sunak disrespected their campaign to “spike the hike” in national insurance. They do find a nurse who says the income tax reduction, which doesn’t kick in until 2024, is “brilliant”. She says, “It’s a good sign and should improve things.” She may be working too hard keeping the NHS going to spend much time on the small print, or she’d see her pay falling well behind prices, with any rise she gets taken from her local NHS funding, whose value, as with all public services, will also decline in this inflationary year. The perpetual puzzle is why so many vote for this party that consistently does them down and rewards the wealthier? I could lay out the usual list of reasons found in polling and focus groups: it’s not only the economy, stupid. The Tories keep tugging on the Brexit rope, a patriotism meme, with Johnson disgustingly comparing Britain’s “freedom” from the EU with Ukrainians fighting for their country – Sunak tugged at the war in a dishonest ploy in his speech yesterday. However, this shameful, shameless mini-budget may mark another stepping stone along the way to turning out these rogues, who these days barely pretend to do more for the country than try to cling to office, vying for future leadership even as they sink in the polls. Labour is shipshape, electable and ahead. The Tories will have divided and shipwrecked the country for long enough by 2024, when the money Sunak disgracefully withholds from universal credit and public services may not buy enough votes.

3/25/2022,"Ukrainian forces have been bolstered by the dramatic destruction of a major Russian landing ship as it brought in supplies to its troops, as Moscow was accused of forcibly deporting thousands of people from the besieged city of Mariupol. As Ukrainian forces struggled to hold the flattened city, it was claimed that civilians in captured territory were being deceived into leaving shelters to be bussed out to Russian camps by soldiers wielding loudhailers. Officials said 15,000 residents of the encircled city had been deported so far after being told by the soldiers that Ukraine had abandoned them, with some sent as far as the Russian island of Sakhalin in the Pacific. Ukraine’s ministry of defence described the move as “a gross violation of international humanitarian law and another proof of Russia’s behaviour as a terrorist state”. Nevertheless, as Ukraine’s Azov battalion appeared to be fighting a losing battle in Mariupol, elsewhere Russian forces have failed to advance – and a significant boost to morale was delivered with the sinking of the Orsk, a ship that had ferried soldiers destined for the besieged city. Dramatic pictures were aired of bellowing fire and black smoke as the Orsk, docked in Berdiansk on the Azov Sea, was hit by Ukrainian ballistic missiles. The ship, which contained weapons and supplies for forces fighting in Mariupol, had featured in a report on Russian television just a few days previously. It was said to be capable of carrying 20 tanks, 45 armoured vehicles and 400 troops. The fire on the Orsk reportedly spread to other vessels as well as an ammunition depot and a fuel terminal in the port. The situation, however, remains grave in Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said, with attempts to evacuate the remaining 100,000 residents blocked by Russian troops. Russian soldiers with loudhailers were instead said to be driving around parts of the city claiming that the city of Odesa has fallen and that other havens for refugees were now rejecting fleeing people. Ukraine’s ministry of defence claimed that those evacuated by the Russians were being taken to “filtration camps” such as one in Dokuchaievsk, in the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, before being moved onwards to Russia itself. “A number of northern regions are mentioned as the final destination, including Sakhalin,” the defence ministry said. “Ukrainians are being offered official employment through employment centres. Those who agree receive documents banning them from leaving Russian regions for two years.” Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said the tactic had echoes of the tactics of the Nazis during the second world war. He said: “What the Russian occupiers are doing cannot be explained. At first, they blockade a peaceful city, purposefully start killing people, and then forcibly deport them to their territory. “Ukraine experienced this only during world war two. Unfortunately, history repeats itself. Only now instead of Nazis – racists. Now we are forming a base of deported Mariupol residents and will work on their return to Ukraine.” Claims of attacks on civilians elsewhere in Ukraine, denied by the Kremlin, continue to be made in growing numbers. Russia was accused on Thursday by Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, of breaching the Geneva conventions by firing rockets filled with white phosphorus in a residential part of the city of Rubizhne in the self-proclaimed republic in Luhansk, killing four and wounding six. It was reported that desperate attempts were also being made to rescue people, including a pregnant woman and six children, from a shelter in Shchastynska, in Luhansk, after the office building in which they were hiding was bombed.",News/World news,Ukraine sinks Russian ship as Moscow accused of forcible deportations from Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/ukraine-sinks-orsk-russian-ship-moscow-accused-forcible-deportations-mariupol
3/25/2022,"Michael Grade has been chosen as the government’s choice to oversee the media regulator, Ofcom, ending one of the more controversial and drawn-out government recruitment processes in recent British political history. The Conservative peer – who has held senior executive positions at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 – will have to face a pre-appointment hearing in front of MPs but is likely to be approved to take the job, finally drawing the process to a close. The 79-year-old has made a series of public interventions on media policy since applying for the job, including calling the BBC licence fee a “regressive tax” and criticising the tone of the broadcaster’s political coverage. While chief executive of Channel 4, he campaigned against its privatisation, but has changed his mind in recent years and spoken out in favour of the proposal. The three-day-a-week role as chair of the communications regulator – which oversees everything from television content to postal services – comes with a £142,500 salary. Ofcom is also taking on responsibility for regulating social media platforms, such as Facebook and TikTok, a major expansion of its powers. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, made the final decision on the appointment in consultation with Downing Street, with Grade edging out his fellow Tory peer and former deputy chairman of the party Stephen Gilbert in the final round of interviews. The chaotic recruitment process took more than two years. The former chair Terry Burns decided to step down in early 2020. Boris Johnson initially offered the job to the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre as part of a range of appointments designed to put government-friendly figures in positions of cultural power. This included a failed attempt to appoint Johnson’s former Daily Telegraph boss Charles Moore as chair of the BBC. Although ministers have the final say on who gets the job, candidates first have to make it through a vetting process involving external interviews. Dacre was deemed unsuitable for the job after he expressed strident views during the interview with the panel. Rather than accept the verdict and appoint a different candidate, the government decided to restart the entire hiring process to give Dacre another chance. This drawn-out and much-mocked second process struggled to attract a sufficient range of candidates or interviewers, with the civil service fixer Sue Gray – later known for her report on Downing Street parties – ultimately brought in to oversee the hiring. When it looked as though Dacre would finally triumph, he unexpectedly withdrew from the process at the last minute without telling the government in advance. This left ministers scrambling to find another preferred candidate. Despite an external professional recruitment firm being paid to find fresh candidates, the final shortlist was dominated by Conservative members of the House of Lords. Asked to declare how many people had actually applied, the civil servant Sarah Healey refused to provide details, telling MPs that the government did not want to “increase speculation on the process” and aimed to “minimise media speculation” about the job. The recruitment process has left Ofcom with a lack of permanent leadership during the pandemic and exposed embarrassing views about Downing Street’s attitude to the regulator. After Dacre withdrew he wrote a scathing attack in the Spectator on the supposed enemies of Brexit – including civil servants and the Guardian – who conspired to block him from getting the job. Dacre said the prime minister had given him the go-ahead to sack the existing Ofcom chief executive, Melanie Dawes, and appoint a fresh figure – potentially triggering some awkward conversations.",News/Media,Government picks Tory peer Michael Grade to chair Ofcom,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/24/government-picks-tory-peer-michael-grade-to-chair-ofcom
3/25/2022,"One of the more positive outcomes of recent years was a re-evaluation of the pace of modern life. Covid abruptly forced the world to slow down and reassess its priorities and since then, many of us have considered what it means to go “back to basics”, to disconnect from the present day to a time when life was simpler. So it was only a matter of time before reality TV did the same. In fact, shows such as Channel 4’s back-to-basics “social experiment” The Simpler Life have been commissioned in waves for years now. It sees 24 Britons adopting the Amish lifestyle for half a year at a Devon farmstead, growing their own food, wearing traditional Amish attire (straw hats and braces for the men, milkmaid dresses and bonnets for the women) and most notably, living without modern conveniences such as the internet and electricity. It fits in with a long-held fascination of television programme-makers: stripping it all back, reimagining our present way of life, whether it’s to critique capitalism or the move away from traditional Christian values. But today these shows focus mainly on a new scourge – the internet. BBC Three’s new dating show, Love in the Flesh, follows five couples who have started relationships “through apps, stories and DMs” but have never met “in the flesh”. Hosted by Love Island alum Zara McDermott, participants will be “whisked away from the pressures of daily life and screens” to see each other face-to-face for the first time in a luxurious Greek beach house (not “villa”, they assure us). In this Love Island meets Catfish hybrid, they will see if the chemistry remains “when there are no filters and no screens to hide behind”. The Courtship, a new Regency era-themed reality dating show, is a mashup of both the aforementioned shows. In what NBC believes to be the antidote to apps, it focuses on a “modern girl tired of modern dating”, Nicole Rémy, who is ditching screen swiping in favour of a more chivalrous approach. “We’re often living in a world that isn’t so focused on making true, deep connections with people,” Rémy told Variety. “The Courtship was a breath of fresh air.” Rémy will date a number of suitors who will not just have to win her heart, but her court (her friends and family). When an admirer leaves, they do so with a final dance (giving the exit a sort of Strictly Come Dancing feel). The Love Island villa has been reimagined as a castle and neon bikinis are ditched in favour of full Bridgerton-esque regalia. Often these shows are billed as being vaguely done in the name of pseudoscience. The real takeaway is usually that producers are running out of reality show formats and the only thing better than drama is a drama in period costume. The Simpler Life does at least monitor the volunteers’ health and wellbeing in order to glean results but already viewers appear less convinced about the virtues of life offline. It was released to tepid reviews and two episodes in, The Courtship has been downgraded to a subsidiary NBC channel. Conversely, the Netflix docusoap Byron Baes, which follows the lives of Australian influencers (and essentially doubles up as a live-action Instagram feed in the process), continues to make waves. Its blend of scripted dialogue and trashy interactions between the social media savvy cast is winning over reviewers, generating huge amounts of internet buzz and being lauded as this year’s newest hatewatch. For now, reality TV seems to be at its best when enmeshed with the worst parts of online life.",Arts/Television & radio,Get off your phone!

3/25/2022,"When the pandemic hit, many of the UK’s 5.7 million public sector employees took part in the largest remote working experiment in history. At the same time, many were also thrust on to the frontline of the country’s response to the Covid crisis. The need to provide UK citizens with vital public services in the midst of an unprecedented healthcare emergency required the rapid adoption of specialised IT equipment and collaboration tools, practically overnight. It was a herculean task, with a great deal at stake: the failure of vital healthcare, policing or judicial services would seriously damage the public’s trust in the institutions that provide them. So how has the public sector coped with these challenges? According to the Office for National Statistics 42% of public sector workers worked flexible hours in 2018, compared with 21% of private sector workers. However, only 3% of public sector workers reported that they worked mainly from home, compared with 17% of people in the private sector. Given how quickly remote working was introduced, it’s hardly surprising that some public sector areas found it more difficult to adapt than others, especially those that were tied to physical locations, dependent on outdated software, or whose processes were primarily paper-based. For example, a report by Healthwatch found that the pandemic has exacerbated access problems, with patients finding it difficult to book GP appointments and get treatment. Cloud-based tools, however, have helped to maintain many services, for example, by allowing many GPs to carry out remote appointments when strict social distancing guidelines made face-to-face ones less possible. Kam Patel, senior director of public sector UK at ServiceNow, a leading digital workflow provider, says that the cloud also proved instrumental in the UK’s rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, mainly because it allowed organisations “to scale up without worrying about whether data centres can cope”. NHS Scotland, for instance, deployed ServiceNow’s cloud-based Now Platform to support an ambitiously rapid vaccine rollout. Created in just six weeks, the vaccine management system integrated and digitised the whole vaccine administration process, enabling people to book their own appointments directly through a citizen portal. Perhaps surprisingly, when delivering vital services during the pandemic, issues often arose from processes rather than technology. “There were a lot of dynamics where the technology was there, but the processes needed to be firmed up,” says Patel. “In the public sector, for example, the need to have parameters [in place] to share data with employees who had shifted to home working caused complications, and prevented the public sector as a whole from utilising some of the solutions that were out there.” Guaranteeing data security has also been a vital part of the shift. Uncontrolled access to public sector networks could potentially cause huge problems. “But the ability to consume the right information at the right job level at the right time is vital [for successful home working], along with access to the applications staff need,” says Patel. The need for remote access to critical information prompted the public sector to update processes and policies. According to a global survey by ServiceNow and ESI ThoughtLab, when government agencies sent workers home, they made digitisation of IT services a priority. More than half of executives now say their data management and security systems are agile, compared with fewer than 20% before the crisis. Collaborative IT tools, which keep remote workers connected and productive while keeping sensitive information secure, are now firmly embedded in many public sector organisations. Tools and processes are much more effective when connected by workflows – something that ServiceNow’s solutions enable. For instance, the Now Platform’s AI-enabled workflows can route IT enquiries to the team best suited to resolving them, or facilitate the secure sharing of information without the need for human intervention. As an example, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was able to function effectively through the pandemic with the use of the ServiceNow Customer Service Management (CSM) solution. The department’s team of public-facing agents grew by 40%, all of whom used CSM while working from home. By streamlining information, processes and admin on one platform, they achieved a 50% reduction in call times, proving that it is possible to improve public service while staff are working from home. Given such results, many public sector workers are keen for some form of remote working to continue. In a 2021 survey of 2,400 workers, the FDA, a public sector union, found that 97% would like to continue to have the option to work from home, with nearly half (48%) saying their work-life balance had improved. So while the unexpected shift to home working created numerous challenges, the successful response by government organisations could mean that hybrid working is here to stay.

3/25/2022,"New initiatives being introduced without warning, lots of duplicated effort, or teams just not communicating with each other: these are the hallmarks of a siloed organisation. And while silos are not uncommon, they can be crippling if not properly managed or addressed. “Silos exist in every business, because traditionally businesses tend to structure themselves around functional departments,” says Nerys Mutlow, who works as an innovation evangelist for ServiceNow, a leading digital workflow company. “But it can create a real lack of accountability and a ‘throw it over the fence’ mentality. Effectively, silos lead to a lot of unproductive work and complexity.” Unfortunately, it seems the pandemic has further entrenched these organisational silos. Early research suggests that silos have increased and collaboration has declined. A Microsoft poll of approximately 9,000 managers and employees across Europe found that 82% of leaders believed their companies were at least as productive as pre-pandemic, but felt more work was being done in silos. Coping with increased silos was one of the top three challenges associated with working remotely. That’s had an impact on innovation – only 40% of those surveyed believe their companies are highly innovative, versus 56% in 2019. Tackling silo mentalityAccording to management consultant Ian Robson, the problem is that, while organisations are facing renewed pressure to keep up, silos slow the pace of change. “Internally, managers and staff continually argue as to who should have done what and when. Problems are often buried rather than addressed. You’ll often see low morale and low performance. “Silo mentality is not automatically reduced by casual meetings in the office,” he adds, “but remote working will definitely create challenges in organisations with a silo mentality.” To tackle this, he says businesses should aim to create more of a horizontal structure with cross-disciplinary teams, rather than work being delivered top-down. “Being service-focused rather than process-focused automatically creates collaborative, high-performance working,” he says. “Silo mentality can be rapidly eliminated once everyone realises their responsibility to provide services to the standard needed by the customer.” The goal is to deliver frictionless workflows across all business areas and functions. It’s a cultural change that can be aided by the next generation of workflow technology, powered by machine learning. As more routine tasks are automated, employees are free to focus on more creative, responsive tasks that take more time and involve cross-team collaboration. Access to data and trend analytics, such as response times, also helps to drive improvement, and the best systems make suggestions for efficiencies along the way. “If you don’t give people a simple way to access whatever they need to do their jobs, you’re making them inefficient,” Mutlow says about the best way to tackle silos. “Start by looking at those high-value, highly complex journeys: where is the biggest impact in your organisation? What generates revenue? What makes you relevant to the customer? And collect data around how these processes are performing to identify the bottlenecks.” There’s also a need to focus on the human element of any transformation, according to Blaine Landis, assistant professor of organisational behaviour at the UCL school of management. In a study of more than 2,000 global teams, organisations with “cultural brokers”, who work to connect teams to each other, significantly outperformed diverse teams without one. These brokers can operate as “bridges” or “adhesives”. “Brokerage is about being able to communicate and interact in very different social worlds to get people to form connections across boundaries,” Landis says. “A bridge would be someone who has good working knowledge of people on either side of the boundary and can translate between them … Adhesives know that people have common interests but aren’t yet connected.” He adds that “perspective taking, cultivating a sense of curiosity, and paying attention to the informal patterns of interactions in the workplace” can all help tackle silos and encourage innovation, and recommends not just looking at the functional groups within an organisation but also the people who interact with one another on a more informal basis. The role of managers in leading changeManagers also have a critical role to play, Robson says. This can often be the most challenging part of tackling silos. “Managers have to change into leaders and create teams that are working across barriers,” he says. “Generally, managers believe the problem is the behaviour of their people. They want to know: ‘What actions do I have to take or what responsibilities do I have to delegate to change other people?’ Rarely do they want to ask the question: ‘How do I have to change the way I think about the culture?’” He recommends starting small by creating a cross-disciplinary team to focus on one key measure of service performance. That model can then be rolled out to other teams to tackle other issues, and eventually employees will operate like this of their own volition. Mutlow agrees a shift in thinking at the leadership level is essential. “Managers are retrospective and directive, whereas a leader creates that vision and gives people the environment to utilise their skills and experience to contribute towards that goal. They’re two very different skill sets.” She’s also found it helpful to recruit team champions to create buy in. “In any large organisation, change fatigue can kick in. If you can get those who are most cynical about it to buy into your way of working, and you give them the autonomy to drive forward their contribution, that helps a lot.” Ultimately, dismantling silos is a continuous effort that goes hand-in-hand with transformation, she adds. “And when you think about transformation, it’s a permanent state of reinvention. We’ve got to stop thinking about it as a project that stops. It’s never going to stop.” Empower people with digital workflows and wherever work goes, make it flow.

3/25/2022,"It’s fast becoming a cliche but it’s true: the pandemic has changed how we work forever. As many businesses shift permanently towards more remote and hybrid ways of working, exactly how and where we do work is being re-evaluated and reimagined. Workplace transformation isn’t a new phenomenon: it’s a trend that’s been around for some time. But the speed at which this transformation is now taking place is unprecedented. The consultancy McKinsey estimates the rate of change has sped up by years as a result of the pandemic. That translates into added pressure for businesses looking to keep up. Luckily, many of the technologies required to make a success of this new way of working already exist – and automation is perhaps most powerful among these. So how exactly can businesses use tools such as automation to address the challenges and opportunities of today? The automation tipping point“We’re at a tipping point where if we can automate the ability for people to share information across departments, they can get work done, and we can provide that better experience for both employees and their customers,” says Paul Hardy, innovation evangelist at ServiceNow. “It allows people to become more creative, more innovative, and think differently.” Prime candidates for automation are boring, repetitive tasks. “Tasks that people dislike doing,” says Hardy, “those mundane, repeatable, error-prone tasks.” He gives the example of one process that all businesses are likely to be familiar with: onboarding new employees. “When someone starts, it touches every department within the organisation,” he says. The IT department provides the new starter with a computer and email access, HR trains them on workplace policies, payroll helps them get paid, and facilities get them a swipe card so they can access the office. However, anyone who has worked in an office will know horror stories about starting a job without the right computer, or the first month’s pay packet being on the wrong tax code. “Traditionally, they’re all done manually, which means when someone joins an organisation, it could be days, if not weeks, before they actually get going on the job they’re there to do,” says Hardy. Automation and digital workflow technologies can play a key role here by ensuring that everyone has access to the same reliable information, wherever they sit in the business and whatever their job role. Removing the repetitiveAnother area where businesses can explore automation is the field of robotic process automation (RPA). This is the name for a range of enterprise technology that sits about halfway between working manually, and full-blown artificial intelligence (AI). What RPA does is essentially use machines to record and repeat repetitive tasks. “A task can be very easily automated using robotic process automation,” says Dr Samiya Khan, post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Wolverhampton, who explains how this automation transformed the processes of an IT services company she worked with. It had previously devoted extensive time and resources to manually sorting log files received via email into an analytics platform. With RPA, the member of staff who did that was freed up to work on something more engaging. “You can have an email-monitoring system that constantly checks or periodically checks for any new email coming from a specific sender, and then downloads the attachments to a specific location, collates the data, and ingests it into the analytics platform,” says Khan. “Sometimes it’s the simplest of tasks that people don’t even realise they’re spending just too much time on, doing the same thing over and over again.” Crucially, RPA can also be a building block for more advanced automation in the future. “When you start with something like RPA, you look at the different business processes [and] how they can be optimised to improve,” she says. “It’s a good starting point for deploying [other] technology, and creating a digital roadmap for small and medium enterprises so that they can begin with something smaller, and then scale that up to something like big data or AI.” The automated futureBusinesses can use other automation techniques, too. Hardy points to methods such as business process optimisation and process mining, for example, whereby core functions are redesigned for maximum efficiency, or event logs are analysed for outcomes. In both cases, paying careful attention to exactly how business processes are carried out offers new opportunities for automation. “It could be something really, really simple. It might not necessarily be something flashy, but it might be removing the foundational work that gets in people’s way.” And the next step? Hardy envisages a future where automation isn’t just a technical process, but something everyone can do. “We talk a lot about ‘low code’ – the ability for anybody in any department to build a business application,” says Hardy. “What about the next stage? What if we don’t even have to code?” But ultimately, for Hardy, automation isn’t just a question of technology – it’s also about improving the workplace for the people using it. So as we rewire our businesses for the new world of work, it’s important to not just think about the impact automation might have on the bottom line – but how it will help your team work better too. “It’s technology that helps people do the work that they love,” says Hardy. “Happy people are more productive people, and more productive people are more profitable for an organisation.” Empower people with digital workflows and wherever work goes, make it flow.

3/25/2022,"The past two years have been fraught with uncertainty. The pandemic made planning for the future difficult, with many business leaders focusing instead on reactive, short-term solutions. But now, with life in the UK returning to normality, people are finally able to plan ahead and take what they’ve learned to create new strategies, grow their business, and build more efficient ways of working for the future. So, to help you and your team work more effectively, keep in mind these six lessons learned over the pandemic. Maintain a work-life balanceThe ability to streamline and work more efficiently – particularly in times of transition and stress – is critical to business survival. But nationwide lockdowns proved that a healthy work-life balance is essential to keeping our minds and bodies in good working order. “I’m being more discerning with what I take on,” says Nikita Akilapa, who runs Nikita Akilapa Birth Services, a holistic support enterprise for pregnant women. “When you first start a business, you say yes to everything because you don’t know when you’re going to go through peaks and troughs. “Now that I’m at a point where I consistently have new business, I feel more comfortable saying no to things that are going to mess with my equilibrium. I’m trying to schedule things so that I have a steady flow of money coming in. This means I can forecast income without having to work every hour of every day, and without having to compromise time with my kids.” The same priorities apply for larger companies, such as ServiceNow, a leading digital workflow company. “The reality is that accelerated digital transformation means work is now completely altered, and we need to establish a new work-life balance to overcome these new challenges,” says Sally Sourbron, vice-president of global talent, EMEA, at ServiceNow. “That’s why we’re encouraging all our teams and employees to create social contracts. Our managers should balance fair expectations with necessary support, and agree with employees what they need to do, how they need to do it, and the outcomes they should drive. At the same time, employees need to be given the tools, and the space they need to achieve those goals.” Get organisedFrancis Stagakis, co-owner of Cycle Docs Workshop in north London, emphasises the importance of simplicity and organisation. “The focus at the moment is to make the business as efficient as possible. Setting everything in the correct place, organising where we keep what, so we don’t spend too much time looking for things. We’re trying to keep it simple because … our current system works well as it is for now.” Undertake market analysisFor Biff Bloom-Burrows, founder and COO of Biff’s, an innovative vegan food operator, one business priority is to use market data to compare vegan products with their non-vegan counterparts. “There’s so much talk about how expensive vegan food is,” he says. “It’s about removing that barrier of price. We want to investigate what chicken wings cost and how much chicken you get on them. And can we normalise our jackfruit wings [the vegan alternative] in terms of price, versus chicken wings?” Market analysis is an essential step in understanding your customers, analysing your competitors, and driving business growth – especially in a dramatically altered business landscape. What worked pre-pandemic might not ring true today, so take the opportunity to collect and use data to better inform your business strategies. Be more agile“Much of what we achieved as a society during the pandemic was down to those organisations that had the capability to think and act rapidly in very testing times, and we should all be grateful for that,” says Jordi Ferrer, vice-president and general manager of ServiceNow UK & Ireland. The pandemic highlighted the importance of business agility, he adds. “In the future, we all need this kind of preparedness,” he says. “By bringing more agility to our technology stack, we can make sure we can shift and change at minimal notice, depending on global and market needs, and secure the insights we really need to drive action.” Create experiencesBloom-Burrows believes customer expectations are changing and that businesses have to change too. As an example, he highlights the concept of visiting a restaurant as being experiential. “Food is not just fuel, it’s an experience,” he says. During the pandemic, he set up “host kitchens” around the country to deliver the Biff’s experience to people’s homes. Once restaurants reopened, Biff’s established itself as a destination, not simply a place to drop into and fill your stomach. The lessons learned from coping with lockdown will remain a core part of Biff’s outlook, and that of many other businesses, as they build secure foundations. Use technology to bridge the gap“Technology is a vital element that boosts productivity and bridges the gap between in-office and remote working,” says Lewis Barker, ServiceNow’s director of real estate and workplace services, EMEA. “Flexibility and choice help employees do their best work,” he adds, highlighting the sharp increase in flexible working hours as employers adapt to staff having other responsibilities, like caring for children who’ve been sent home from school due to illness.

3/25/2022,"Mother-of-three Amy believed in the criminal justice system until one day in 2019, when she was arrested by police after being misidentified as an aggressor during a family violence incident. Amy, who cannot use her surname for legal reasons, was remanded in custody overnight before a bail hearing the following morning. Under 2018 reforms to Victoria’s bail laws, she had to prove she had “compelling reasons” or “exceptional circumstances” to be released on bail. Before, she would not have been subject to either test. “I explained I had two older children, one of which had disability and would go into foster care if I was remanded, and I told them I had a baby who was 17 months old and had spent every day of his life in my care,” she told Guardian Australia. “I was told I didn’t meet the threshold and I was remanded into custody. I ultimately pleaded guilty to the charge just to get out because I wasn’t seeing my children.” Amy spent a total of 120 days in jail and has lost custody of two of her children. She shared her story with a parliamentary inquiry into Victoria’s criminal justice system that on Thursday recommended the state government review its bail laws after the recent changes had led to a rise in the number of people on remand. Women were disproportionately affected. Also among the report’s 100 recommendations is to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14. In the report, the chair of the legislative council’s legal and social issues committee, Reason party MP Fiona Patten, wrote that raising the age to 14 was consistent with evidence about child development, international norms and human rights standards. She said it would help “divert children into social services rather than trapping them in the criminal justice system from an early age”. Across Australia, children as young as 10 can be arrested by police, remanded in custody, convicted by the courts and jailed. Indigenous children are disproportionately affected and make up the vast majority of imprisoned children. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning However, Amy had long hoped for a direct recommendation to change the state’s bail laws. Instead, they were recommended to be reviewed. The inquiry found almost half of all women in prison were on remand – an increase from 22% in 2010. A larger proportion of women had been held on remand in recent years than men, with this figure even higher for Aboriginal women. The inquiry also found female victim-survivors of family violence were regularly misidentified by police and recommended additional training and education for officers. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, Human Rights Law Centre, Fitzroy Legal Service and FlatOut are calling on the Andrews government to urgently reform the state’s bail laws, including by repealing the reverse-onus provisions. “This report is a long overdue wake-up call and an opportunity for the Andrews government to make the right decision and fix Victoria’s bail laws,” said Monique Hurley, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre.

The inquiry also recommended the Victorian government invest in community-based social, health, legal and forensic services to help address the factors underpinning the criminal behaviours of children and young people.",News/Australia news,‘Long overdue’: MPs call for review of Victoria’s bail laws that disproportionately affect women,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/long-overdue-mps-call-for-review-of-victorias-bail-laws-that-disproportionately-affect-women
3/25/2022,"The Labor party’s head office spent weeks shopping for a celebrity candidate in a bid to railroad a local rank and file ballot in the federal seat of Parramatta, before moving to install former Kevin Rudd adviser Andrew Charlton in the seat. The party has now confirmed its national executive will not hold a local preselection to replace retiring MP Julie Owens in the seat, and will instead hold a rapid-fire four-day nomination process before a candidate is chosen by the national executive. Coming “at the request of the federal parliamentary Labor leader”, Anthony Albanese, the move has infuriated local branch members who say the decision to parachute a candidate into the marginal seat is another missed opportunity to increase the party’s diversity inside parliament. At least three candidates from Parramatta – or nearby branches – had intended to run for preselection in the seat. Durga Owen, a former staffer for retiring MP Julie Owens from the party’s soft left faction, had been considered a frontrunner for the seat, but faced competition from former Sydney Morning Herald journalist Alan Mascarenhas. A third candidate, Abha Devasia, a lawyer from Labor’s hard left who is not from the seat but lives nearby, had also been touted for the job and had union support – but is also now likely to miss out. The decision to skip over the three candidates – all from diverse backgrounds – and instead install Charlton, who is white, has angered the candidates as well as those in the branch. “That seat is one of the most diverse in Australia and it’s a reflection of our country,” Devasia said. “We don’t see that in parliament. We can’t talk about multiculturalism as a festival or as something nice in Harmony Week. It’s about allowing us to be part of the decision making process.” Owen too said she was “disappointed” that local members “couldn’t choose the next candidate”. “But Andrew Charlton would also be a fantastic member and I’ll put on my Labor shirt and be out there with him to make sure Labor wins government.” But while Charlton is now likely to be installed as the party’s candidate when national executive votes next week, Labor figures had spent weeks shopping for candidates in a bid to railroad the preselection. Guardian Australia understands at least four other people – three men, one woman, all of them white – had all been approached to contest the seat. Among them were David Borger, a former state MP, and the Sydney barrister Cameron Murphy, who has twice run unsuccessfully for the state seat of East Hills. The push to avoid a rank and file ballot has infuriated local branch members. Head of the Parramatta federal electoral committee, James Shaw, wrote to Albanese and NSW general secretary, Bob Nanva, demanding a rank and file ballot a number of times but received no reply. Shaw told Guardian Australia he was “disappointed” with the decision. “I realise at this stage it’s difficult [to change] but I do think that the principle should apply that party members should have a vote as to who their candidate is,” he said. “It’s absolutely nothing personal against Andrew [Charlton], but I just think ultimately the party rules are that party members vote and choose who the members are.” Shaw said that while “anyone is entitled to run”, the decision – which comes just a few months after Labor installed Kristina Keneally into the western Sydney seat of Fowler despite Tu Le, a local lawyer with a Vietnamese background, previously indicating an intention to nominate. “It does make it difficult to have a diverse caucasus,” Shaw said. “There are a number of candidates from different backgrounds wanting to run and they’ve been denied that chance now, and that is part of my disappointment.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It comes after Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday that retiring MP, Julie Owens, had requested a rank and file ballot to fill her spot. “The branches have really been a major part of serving the electorate of Parramatta and they actually should have a say,” she told Guardian Australia. “I’ve said before one of the great strengths of our democracy is that our leaders are chosen by people who know them. I firmly believe my branch members are in the best position to decide on who the best person to replace me in Parramatta is.”",News/Australia news,Labor spent weeks shopping for high-profile candidates for Parramatta seat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/labor-spent-weeks-shopping-for-high-profile-candidates-for-parramatta-seat
3/25/2022,"Our skin carries so much complex and ambiguous meaning. By definition it is superficial, but our experience of it is profound. It is the border of the body, but also porous and easily breached; it is what others first see of us, the part of our physical selves that we present to the world, and also where we register that world, touching and being touched, in return. It is a visible site of oppression with a long history and continuing legacy, a marker of many kinds of privilege – but also an organ like any other. It’s these “strange and wonderful” and often-contradictory associations towards which Phillipa McGuinness is gesturing with the title of her second book: skin deep may well suggest just the surface level, but skin is also important enough that it “makes us who we are”. It’s a sizeable claim, at first glance, but it is backed up in no small part by the sheer breadth of McGuinness’s research, with chapters on anatomy and dermatology, cosmetics and tattooing, cancer, skin hunger, racism and whiteness. The fields of expertise she draws upon are equally wide-ranging, and McGuinness brings these different kinds of knowledge into contact with each other with energy and skill: scientists sit beside historians beside authors; she speaks to activists, geneticists, YouTubers, cultural theorists, anthropologists, and clinicians of both wellness and medical training. This broad, even eclectic curiosity is one of the strengths of Skin Deep, especially because it so often reveals similarities in understanding or fascination beneath the very different purposes, approaches and even languages of all these fields. This is reinforced too by McGuinness’s careful inclusion of ordinary voices who have (forgive me) skin in the game: people whose lives have been affected by severe and chronic eczema, for example, or by melanoma, by racist prejudice and bias, or who have modified their skin to change the way they are perceived. Some of the most striking material in the book is devoted to skin cancers, where McGuinness examines the scope of the problem in Australia. The statistics she includes are truly terrifying – two-thirds of the Australian population is affected by skin cancer of some kind, and the national prevalence of melanoma here is 12 times that of the worldwide average. (As a redhead, I am now convinced that melanoma will be my cause of death, RIP me.) Yet skin cancer has also been the focus of “one of the most effective public health campaigns in history,” McGuiness writes – and the full effect of this messaging will only become apparent across this coming decade, as the first children born since the campaign started in 1981 turn 40, the age at which many skin cancers will begin to form. There could easily be an entire book written on this topic alone – which is the case for many of the chapters in Skin Deep, which is something of a mixed blessing for the book as a whole. It is, of course, integral to the book’s expansive and always interesting enquiry – but it also means that the book occasionally feels unfocused or hurried in some sections, especially towards the final chapters. There is so much within Skin Deep, though, that is fascinating and deftly handled. McGuinness has a remarkable ability to write about scientific concepts and processes in a way that is accessible and lucid, and deploys her cheeky, geeky sense of humour, usually in swift asides, to offset some of the book’s more difficult material. Her discussion of race, without which any book about skin would be glaringly incomplete, is skilful without being showy, drawing together genetics, colonial and political history, and anti-racist movements, all the while largely (and quietly) foregrounding the words of people of colour . McGuinness states in her introduction that she considers the “quest to make sense of skin” to be a “moral one”, because it touches on so many bigger structures – racism, patriarchy, ability and age – and our conceptualisations of self, community, and public. It is a “contact zone” – that is, a concept all the more charged when contact can no longer be unthinking or taken for granted. McGuinness’s natural inquisitiveness, and her ability to make the most familiar topics feel fresh, make her explorations always fascinating and full of marvel.

3/25/2022,"A report into thousands of incidents of abuse and neglect of aged care residents that was expected to be completed by the end of last year has not been released, as bureaucrats discuss the need for a “strategic narrative”. In the wake of the damning Royal Commission into Aged Care report, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission released in May 2021 the “first in a series of reports … drawing on information from serious incident notifications”. The first Serious Incident Response Scheme (SIRS) insight report was eight pages long and covered six weeks. In that time there were 192 unexpected deaths reported, 448 cases of neglect, and 778 cases of “unreasonable use of force”. Overall there were 1,876 priority 1 notifications. But since then, there has not been a follow-up report, despite one being expected by the end of last year. In a statement, the commission said that report was “discretionary” and that the commission was “exploring options” on how to present information. “Work on this report is continuing alongside the regular reporting of SIRS data,” it said. In a different report that is less easily accessible and covers the last quarter of 2021, there were 5,102 priority 1 incidents reported – more than 2.7 times as many as in the six-week period. Since then, emails obtained from the commission show months of delays preparing the second report, while bureaucrats discuss the formatting and messaging. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report is still unpublished despite the emails several times showing it was close to completion. Sarah Russell, an aged care advocate and independent running against health minister Greg Hunt in Flinders, asked the commission about the report after being told in November last year it would be published within weeks. Russell said families wanted the data, and greater transparency in the sector. “We know if they report the data, providers improve their standards of care,” she said. “These numbers are older people being assaulted, abused, raped and neglected.” The commission statement said it took its responsibility for accountability and transparency “very seriously” and that the SIRS data was now included in sector performance reports and the commission’s annual report. The latest statistics in the sector performance report show that from 1 October 2021 to 31 December 2021, 2,443 residents suffered an “unreasonable use of force”. There were 199 “unexpected” deaths. More than 1,000 cases of neglect were reported and 515 cases of unlawful sexual conduct or inappropriate sexual contact. Other incidents included psychological or emotional abuse, stealing, and unexplained absences. A freedom of information request obtained by the ABC shows at least seven drafts of a second report in the more accessible format were prepared. The emails between senior commission staff and commissioner Janet Anderson started towards the end of June when Anderson asked for “urgent action” and continue to mid-December. Staff discussed the “strategic narrative” and “messaging” needed, and in July discussed a final releasable version to be ready “shortly”. After a lull, the emails resume in November. At one point Anderson says it “really has been a laborious writing task”. The most recent email released included a tweet from Russell saying the report is overdue. Russell said it was “so disappointing” to see bureaucrats “trying to make a strategic narrative out of people’s lives”. “They are massaging the data,” she said. “Can we have transparent reporting of data? These are older people who deserve the answers.”",News/Australia news,Report into abuse of aged care residents delayed as bureaucrats discussed ‘strategic narrative’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/report-into-abuse-of-aged-care-residents-delayed-as-bureaucrats-discussed-strategic-narrative
3/25/2022,"A staggering 97% of aged care workers have not received the Morrison government’s promised $800 bonus, according to a survey. The federal government promised in January it would give 265,000 aged care staff a maximum of $800 in two instalments ahead of the election. The bonus payments were designed to address concerns about underpayment, staff turnover and the government’s pandemic response. Providers were eligible to apply for the payment from 1 March for any worker active in the industry on 28 February, and the government asked providers to fork out the money to give to workers before their applications were approved and finalised with government. A survey of 1,000 aged care workers conducted by the United Workers Union (UWU) revealed 97% have not yet received the bonus payment. More than 75% said they had received no information about the bonus. The UWU said surveyed workers expressed anger that the payments, which the government had signalled would be paid quickly, were caught up in lengthy bureaucratic processes. The survey results come as aged care workers across the country take the first steps towards industrial action, lodging applications with the Fair Work Commission. The UWU says those applications span facilities employing more than 13,000 workers. “Aged care workers were failed in the vaccination program, they were failed with PPE, they were left to fend for themselves during Omicron, working repeated double shifts – and now they have been failed in the bonus program,” UWU aged care director Carolyn Smith said. “Aged care workers haven’t been fooled – this bonus doesn’t even touch the sides on the chronic understaffing, the outrageous workloads and the lack of time to care that existed even before Covid,” Smith said. The government’s formal advice to aged care providers is that they should pay the money to their workers at the time they lodge applications with the government. That effectively asks a sector that is seriously underfunded to stump up the money before their claims are even approved by the government. Last week, the government said it had received just 322 applications, all of which are still being assessed. It was expecting to receive 1,650 by the time applications close in early April. A spokesman for aged care minister Richard Colbeck said on Thursday that 650 applications had now been received from providers. “Allocations of bonus payments to aged care workers is on schedule,” the spokesman said. “In the three weeks since the grant round has been open, the Department has received more than 650 applications out of an expected 1600 for the round.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Health Services Union (HSU) said the government had been repeatedly warned about issues restricting access to the scheme, including the requirement that cash-strapped providers pay workers prior to receiving approval. “The for-profits, there’s not many of them, I can see they might dip into their profit margin,” HSU secretary Gerard Hayes said. “But the not-for-profits, I’ve got no idea where they would get the money to facilitate this.” Colbeck’s office said the program was “demand-driven” and that providers had been encourage to pay workers at the time they submit their application for the bonus. His office also indicated that some providers were submitting applications incorrectly. “The department is working closely with providers where applications have been completed incorrectly,” a spokesman said. “Staff are encouraged to talk to their employer and seek the information that has been provided to them through peak aged care organisations and unions.”",News/Australia news,Survey finds 97% of Australia’s aged care workers have not received $800 bonus,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/survey-finds-97-of-australias-aged-care-workers-have-not-received-800-bonus
3/25/2022,"Building a single fibre connection to a business in Barnaby Joyce’s New England electorate is expected to cost more than $600,000, almost double the original estimate, documents obtained by Guardian Australia reveal. In February, Guardian Australia reported that the ASX-listed Costa Group’s tomato plant in Guyra received more than $500,000 under the federal government’s regional connectivity program to switch from satellite NBN to a fibre-to-the-premises connection. Joyce wrote a letter in support of the project in 2020, when he was a backbencher. So far it is the only fibre-to-the-premises conversion as part of the $100m grants program. In the September 2020 letter, now obtained under freedom of information laws, Joyce said the upgrade was “urgently needed to address the continued increases in bandwidth required at Costa’s Guyra facilities for the many software and online systems utilised to support the company’s high-tech practices and equipment used to achieve greater yield efficiencies”. Joyce said Costa had committed to providing 25% of the project’s cost, or $84,500 of the estimated total of $338,000, with $253,500 being sought from taxpayers. NBN Co was subsequently allocated $520,000 to build the fibre network for Costa’s premises as part of the $117m awarded in the first round of the grant program. Costa told Guardian Australia this week its contribution would now be $110,000, putting the total cost at $630,000. A spokesperson for Costa said the initial estimated cost was provided by NBN Co, and the amount sought in the grant application was the final estimate quoted by NBN Co. A spokesperson for the communications department said all proposals under the program were competitively assessed, and funding recommendations made to the then regional communications minister Mark Coulton were based on the assessment criteria, including the economic and social benefits to the region. The department has previously stated that other homes in the area would be able to connect to the service once it was up and running. The spokesperson declined to provide more information on the project, stating the total cost and other grant information was commercial-in-confidence. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NBN Co confirmed the total cost of the joint federal government, Costa and Armidale council project was $630,000 and construction was expected to commence in June. In February a spokesperson for Joyce defended the letter of support. “This was done in his capacity as federal member for New England and in recognition of the benefits the project could deliver to the region, of which there were plenty,” the spokesperson said. In Joyce’s register of interests, he discloses that his partner, Vikki Campion, has shares in Costa Group, although it does not indicate how many she holds. Joyce did not disclose in the letter that Campion held shares in the company. Asked in February whether Joyce had disclosed the shares in the letter, a spokesperson said: “Any suggestion Mr Joyce acted inappropriately is off base and only serves to perpetuate the anti-regions campaign the Labor party is running.” There is no suggestion of any impropriety by Joyce or Campion.

3/25/2022,"The Australian government publicly pledged to buy 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal from miner Whitehaven to donate to Ukraine before finalising the cost to the taxpayer – and failed to approach at least one other major coalminer to gauge their interest. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Sunday announced the federal government was buying coal from Whitehaven to donate to the Ukrainian government, with the assistance of Poland, to help provide energy security to the war-torn nation. The announcement was welcomed by Ukraine and trumpeted by the Coalition which publicly thanked Whitehaven, a Liberal donor, for its assistance. The government pledged to pay the entire cost of supplying and transporting the coal. The price of coal has surged to unprecedented levels due to Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, said on Wednesday the cost of acquiring the coal and sending it to Ukraine was “still being finalised” three days after the government publicly committed to the purchase. Guardian Australia made inquiries with several major coalminers, one of whom confirmed they had not been approached. New Hope Group, an Australian-owned coalminer, said it had “not been approached by the federal government” in relation to the deal to donate thermal coal to Ukraine. Glencore, another major coalminer, declined to comment about whether it had been approached. BHP and Yancoal did not respond to requests for comment. Pitt said he had contacted Whitehaven management directly. Asked whether he approached other resource companies at the same time he said Whitehaven was “the first company to give a positive response to the request”. “Given the urgency of the request I contacted Whitehaven management directly who indicated they could provide the coal for Ukraine without disrupting existing contracts despite high international demand,” Pitt said. Estimates based on current coal prices have suggested 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal is worth at least $31m. The volume of coal would reportedly only power a medium-sized coal-fired generator for three to five days. Ukraine, which first made the request to Australia, says it would welcome any further coal the government can provide. Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Volodymyr Shalkivskyi, said Ukraine had not nominated any single amount of coal when it requested help from the Australian government. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The request was that we would appreciate any amount of assistance, any amount of coal that you would find possible and relevant to provide in this situation,” the ambassador said. “So we are grateful for what was announced and we would welcome any additional steps in the future if the Australian government finds it’s possible.” Since the 2013-14 financial year, Whitehaven Coal has declared $140,000 in donations, all to the Liberal party. Guardian Australia is not suggesting those donations played any role in the decision to procure the coal through Whitehaven. Pitt rubbished the notion that donations were a factor, stating: “The only motivation was to meet Ukraine’s request to supply the coal as quickly as we can to meet the urgent energy needs of the country’s people. Any suggestion otherwise is rubbish.” Pitt said he had no contact with Whitehaven’s chair, former deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Mark Vaile, about the deal. The minister said the resources department was speaking with other coal producers about whether they could supply more coal to Europe. “The department has also [been] engaging with all Australian coal producers who may be able to assist meet any shortfalls among European friends,” he said. “They’ve all indicated they will help where they can.” Idemitsu Australia, which owns the Boggabri coalmine, said it was not approached directly about potentially supplying coal to Ukraine but its chief executive, Steve Kovac, said it was working as part of an “industry response to the government’s request for assistance”. Morrison said on Sunday when announcing the Whitehaven deal that finding thermal coal that was not already tied up in export contracts was difficult. “When we had to put this together, Minister Pitt, who’s done a terrific job on this, was able to work with them to access those coal supplies and then to be able to work through to arrange the shipping at very short notice,” the prime minister said. “Much of Australia’s coal exports are contracted. And so this was not a simple matter, and it was able to be resolved quite quickly.”",News/Australia news,Coalition went ‘directly’ to Liberal donor Whitehaven to purchase coal for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/coalition-went-directly-to-liberal-donor-whitehaven-to-purchase-coal-for-ukraine
3/25/2022,"In the pink enveloping walls of The Salon in Clovelly, the hairdresser Ash Croker has assembled a group of businesswomen who usually attend her eastern suburbs salon for balayage, foils or a trim. They’ve come to meet Allegra Spender, the independent candidate for Wentworth, whose campaign is engendering a frisson of interest among female voters and gaining high-profile support from leading women in the electorate. The latest is Rowena Danziger, the former head of the elite private girls’ school Ascham in Darling Point, where Spender was head girl. “I’ve known Allegra Spender since she was a child in kindergarten, and I was her headmistress from then until she passed the Higher School Certificate,” Danziger says. “I’m voting for Allegra, because she is very intelligent, she’s hardworking, and she’s a woman of great probity. She will work hard for this electorate and it will be safe in her hands. “I think we need the independents to change the conversation and to change the agenda, not only for climate change but for so many other things as well.” Danziger, who later became a board director, joins Jillian Broadbent, another pioneering woman of Australia’s boardrooms, in backing Spender’s campaign. But it’s not just high-profile businesswomen who are backing her. Women are organising gatherings throughout the electorate to meet Spender and help fundraise. Croker says she approached the campaign to hold an event “because as a woman in business, I like her message”. “I am uncertain about what the future holds and I believe in her messages about climate change and our need to take urgent steps – and I want someone like her supporting our local area.” At Tuesday night’s function was Jenny Ringland, a client of Croker’s since 2005 who works in sustainability and has a communications business, Green and Simple. Also attending were Vanessa Cardonnel, who works in asset management and sustainability for a developer, and Gemma Yeates, a fund manager and “a politics tragic”. “She is very business-focused,” says Cardonnel. “She’s focused on moving Australia forward and taking advantage of the business opportunities of moving towards a more sustainable future.” With only just over 2,000 votes determining the outcome in Wentworth in 2019, the campaign is hoping to hold independent Kerryn Phelps’s voters and win a few more Liberal voters, notably from conservative-leaning businesswomen and “trust fund kids” – children of wealthy parents who until now have tended to follow their parents’ voting patterns. “The support I’ve received from women in business has been overwhelming,” says Spender, who was managing director of the Carla Zampatti fashion brand for a decade before moving into sustainable energy and an education-focused not-for-profit. “Women in business are strong, and they bring compassion and authenticity to their work,” she says. “They’re ready for a new, future-focused economy and have been dismayed by what they’ve seen in politics over the past three years. A lot of them have seen significant change in business’s attitudes to gender over the past few decades, and are frustrated that parliament still lags behind.” The Liberal MP for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, did not respond to requests for comment. A similar dynamic is helping power the campaigns of Sophie Scamps in Mackellar and Kylea Tink in North Sydney. The fashion designers Heidi Middleton of Sass & Bide and Genevieve Smart of Ginger & Smart have already held fundraising events for the Scamps campaign. An event for women planned at the local cinema is coming up. The campaign has also tapped into the expertise of craft groups set up to make reusable boomerang bags. They are now making yellow and blue bunting (Scamps’s campaign colours) for events. “We wanted to emulate some of the organising events that were used in Indi,” says Scamps’s campaign organiser, Anyo Geddes. “We think craft groups are a great way to spread the word.” “It’s no surprise that at each stage, it has been women who were the early adopters and jumped on board to help drive a different way of doing politics,” says Scamps.

Her rival in Mackellar, the Liberal MP Jason Falinski, said his campaign had also received the endorsement of high-profile women in the seat, and that it too had a highly engaged group of women supporters. “Constituents have had the opportunity to meet some of our key cabinet ministers including Jane Hume and Michaela Cash. Both of these ministers are making important public policy contributions on issues that directly impact women’s financial security and safety in the workplace and elsewhere,” he said. “We run programs like Female Founders to support local businesses and entrepreneurs,” he said. He also pointed to the series he has been running, “Pitt Dialogues”, which have included a number of high-profile women speakers. “Throughout my career I have worked to action policy which I believe represents the best interests of the whole electorate, and support from women indicates to me that I have listened to their concerns and acted on them,” Falinski said. “This election is not about winning a particular vote, it is about offering the best possible vision for a better Australia.” Tink says she has been working hard to connect with different groups from across the North Sydney community and doesn’t discriminate or prioritise based on the makeup of their membership. In terms of women’s events, Tink recently hosted an International Women’s Day breakfast at the Kirribilli Club, spoke at an assembly at Willoughby girls’ high school and attended a cooking session with an Armenian women’s group for Harmony Day.",News/Australia news,‘A different way of doing politics’: Sydney independents reach out to female voters ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/a-different-way-of-doing-politics-sydney-independents-reach-out-to-female-voters
3/25/2022,"Australia’s first electric motorcycle has taken out the top prize at the Victorian premier’s 25th Design awards, with judges hailing its ingenuity. The state awards showcase products and businesses creating cutting-edge and innovative designs. The Savic C-Series electric motorcycle series are emission-free, full sized and high-performance vehicles. The series was created by former Ford worker and company chief executive, Dennis Savic, and concept designer David Hendroff. The vehicle also won the product design category. The judges praised the design for combining the power of a traditional motorcycle with electric technology. Creative industries minister, Danny Pearson, said the awards celebrated Victorian designers whose products and processes used “design thinking to reshape and improve the way we live, work and interact”. “Design is about finding new, innovative and more sustainable ways of doing things. This year’s winners demonstrate the impact of the Victorian design sector, creating jobs across the state and touching all of our lives,” he said. An ankle brace that grows with young children with hereditary spastic paraplegia – inherited disorders that cause weakness and stiffness in the leg muscles – was recognised in the student design category. The design was created by a team of RMIT students. They also received a special commendation award for circular design and sustainability. The Broadmeadows town hall won the architectural design category and an audio accessibility service for sports broadcast was awarded the digital design prize. The design awards are spread across eight categories: architectural, communication, digital, product, fashion, service, student and design strategy. The awards are part of the 2022 Melbourne Design Week. It is estimated Victoria’s design industry contributes about $6m to the state’s economy each year.",News/Australia news,First Australian electric motorcycle wins Victorian design award,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/first-australian-electric-motorcycle-wins-victorian-design-award
3/25/2022,"My daughter has just started prep and, in addition to the herculean task of getting her out the door five mornings a week, we have to pack a lunch. It’s a complex business. Nuts are out and if there’s too much sugar, processed food or excessive use of cling wrap, your mug shot could be all over social media with the headline: “Distraught mum lunch-shamed over THIS”. You’d think that Googling “kids’ lunchbox ideas” would help, but seeing what pops up in response can be overwhelming. There are heart-shaped sandwiches, alternating-coloured fruit kebabs, vegetable sticks with homemade hummus and Moroccan couscous salads. Plus, a handwritten positive affirmation – 2022’s essential lunchbox item. What a contrast this is to my early school years, a time when fringes and Cabbage Patch Dolls were massive and slinging a lunch box together was no big deal. In the eighties, my aqua lunchbox typically contained a strassburg sandwich, a muesli bar and fruit. My peers’ lunches were similarly unfussy. Chicken loaf was a popular protein; peanut butter was slapped on fearlessly; and prima juice boxes were a regular fixture – this was before juice was considered the devil’s sugary brew. Pieces of fruit rolled around our school bags for weeks until they fermented. And at recess, children skipped about with fluorescent-orange fingertips, thanks to the Cheezels and Twisties that they consumed for play lunch. Sonia Wells went to school in the seventies. Vegemite or cheese sandwiches accompanied by fruit were the norm, ferried to school in a brown paper bag. Having immigrant parents meant that more exotic ingredients were also included. “Sometimes I’d take mortadella sandwiches. Nobody teased me. The area I grew up in was really multicultural – there were lots of kids from Greek, Italian and Lebanese backgrounds.” One of Wells’s friends, who used to go to school with frittata sandwiches, didn’t have it so easy. By lunchtime, the sandwiches smelled and were soggy, making her a target for teasing. The soggy sandwich is something that has blighted generations of students. Take Phil Smith, who went to primary school in the fifties: “I loved a beetroot sanga but the juices stained my books pink,” he says. In Smith’s lunch bag, sandwiches ruled. Some of the filling options that were standard to him would be unfamiliar to many today. “I had Camp Pie and sauce sangas … Camp Pie is like spam but much better. There were Peck’s Paste sandwiches too [a type of fish paste], with a Monte Carlo or Scotch Finger biscuit thrown in on a good week.” Smith could swap food with his peers without fear of triggering an allergic reaction. “I had a mate from Switzerland – he had salami sangas on rye bread and we used to do a swap. They were delicious!” So what about today’s packed lunches? I threw the question out to an Australian primary school teachers’ forum and received many impassioned replies. The responses confirm that some schoolchildren eat “like kings and queens” with a smörgåsbord of wholesome homemade snacks, sushi, sandwiches or cutely cut fruit. “I look at their lunches and salivate,” one teacher said. Several teachers pointed out that, while these lunches are usually healthy, the sheer quantity of food provided means it takes ages for the children to eat them.Multicultural meals are common too and no longer a source of embarrassment, with students bringing thermoses of fragrant curries, noodles and fried rice. One teacher mentioned the time he was making a lamb and tzatziki wrap for his son’s school lunch. His own father, who had come from Greece after the second world war, was there at the time, and concerned that his grandson would be teased for having “different” garlicky food. His grandson assured him that the only time other children commented on his lunch was to ask if they could have some. The grandpa was amazed – his own experience with school lunches had not been so happy. According to the primary school teachers, packaged snack foods like biscuits, lollies, chips and “SO much chocolate” are still fuelling a significant number of children. There were mentions of students eating a cold McDonald’s cheeseburger or a family pack of chips. Some children go to school with no food at all, a stark reminder that, for some, lunch is a luxury. When packing lunches, we’d do well to remember that generations used to thrive on a sandwich. Tomorrow, I’ll just make my daughter a Vegemite sandwich and throw in an apple. Maybe I should make it with wholegrain bread, or is sourdough better? I’ll add some cheese for protein. But will that make her too thirsty? Watermelon should sate her thirst. On second thoughts, will the watermelon leak all over her sandwich?",Lifestyle/Food,From Camp Pie and sauce sangas to sushi rolls: how Australian school lunches have changed,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/25/from-camp-pie-and-sauce-sangas-to-sushi-rolls-how-australian-school-lunches-have-changed
3/25/2022,"There’s a freezer at the back of my house that I didn’t want. When it was purchased, I protested in what could graciously be called a hissy fit. We didn’t need it. It was a useless extravagance. We weren’t the kind of people who ate leftovers, anyway. We were young, fun, vivacious, out every night at a new joint with a new group of friends. A pandemic, six or seven lockdowns, and a newborn baby later, the freezer is arguably much more vital to the smooth running of our household than I am. I’ve never been good at admitting I’m wrong, which is odd since I have had an awful lot of practice. I’m not so much a know-it-all as I am a know-it-a-little-and-say-it-loud. Another example, the viral argument of wheels v doors. Within 30 seconds of hearing the problem I had declared that obviously there were more doors in the world. Anyone who entertained the notion that there could be more wheels in the world than doors was a fool! And from that moment I found myself haunted by wheels. Everywhere I looked: wheels! I was trapped in my own zero-stakes version of The Tell-Tale Heart. I knew I was wrong but how do you admit it? Millennials have a defined aesthetic to admitting fault – the Notes App apology. The Notes App apology is ubiquitous to the point that it is no longer truly necessary to actually read its content. You can assume, by the simple visual cue of a Notes App screenshot that the poster is admitting fault, has done soul-searching, is listening, committed to do better, and will be taking a short break to work on themselves. That itself is a problem. As soon as an apology becomes formulaic it loses all potency. It now holds all the authenticity of the mumbled “sorry” of a four-year-old forced to apologise for smacking his brother – knowing full well that he intends to smack his brother again as soon as this repentance ceremony is over. How, in a world where we’re wronger – louder and more often – than ever, are we to find the means to make a genuine apology? It should be enough to admit fault, show remorse and detail how you will ensure the behaviour does not recur, but that’s boring. I’m not looking for a basic apology, I want the perfect apology. The child deep inside of me that never really learned to deal with being in trouble wants to admit that I’m wrong so well that everyone agrees that I was actually right all along and furthermore an untouchable moral paragon that should not be limited to mere correct/incorrect binaries. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning It’s good to feel a little bit bad when you’re wrong. It’s a small act of rebellion against a post-shame era. It shows you still care enough about getting things right. In blunt terms, it means you’re not an arsehole, particularly when it’s so easy to shrug off the error without a second thought. Still, we fear admitting we’re wrong because we worry that people will realise that we aren’t perfect. As if they ever were under the mistaken impression that we were perfect. What does it matter to me that there are actually a great number of wheels in the world or a freezer in our house? Nothing more than that acknowledging these things would require the death of my massive ego. Frankly, that feels awful. It’s shameful, it’s embarrassing. You went out on a limb and now it’s crashing to the ground. So, what’s the right answer to admitting you’re wrong? The first and most important lesson – as always – is don’t be a big weirdo about it. Not everything requires a giant mea culpa or a performative announcement. At some point, you are not apologising, you are finding a new way to express your ego. Understand the degree of your infraction and where it falls on the spectrum from “my bad” to the Notes App screenshot. From there, the secret is just to be vulnerable and genuine, both easy things to fake. Or, if that’s too hard, do what I do and settle for simply never being wrong ever again.
