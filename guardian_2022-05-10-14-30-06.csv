5/10/2022,"South Korea’s new president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has offered North Korea “an audacious plan” to transform its creaking economy in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons programme. Speaking on the first day of his presidency on Tuesday, Yoon said: “While North Korea’s nuclear weapon programmes are a threat not only to our security and that of North-east Asia, the door to dialogue will remain open so that we can peacefully resolve this threat.” Yoon has previously vowed to take a tougher stance against Pyongyang than his predecessor, but appears to have avoided provoking the regime amid speculation that it could be preparing to conduct a nuclear test. North Korea has previously rejected incentives tied to progress on abandoning its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. “If North Korea genuinely embarks on a process to complete denuclearisation, we are prepared to work with the international community to present an audacious plan that will vastly strengthen North Korea’s economy and improve the quality of life for its people,” he told a crowd of 40,000 people attending his inauguration outside the national assembly in Seoul, according to the Yonhap news agency. The North’s missiles and nukes were a threat to South Korean, regional and global security, he said, adding: “The door to dialogue will remain open so that we can peacefully resolve this threat.” Yoon, a conservative who replaced the liberal former human rights lawyer Moon Jae-in, officially began his presidency at midnight on Monday with a security briefing at an underground bunker – a sign that the North’s nuclear weapons will be high on the agenda throughout his single five-year term. Pyongyang prefaced Yoon’s inauguration, after a closely contested, rancorous campaign, by conducting a volley of test launches, including those involving long-range missiles. The North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, could dramatically raise the diplomatic stakes very soon, with US and South Korean officials speculating that the regime could be preparing to conduct its first nuclear test since 2017 later this month, possibly around the time Yoon is due to meet Joe Biden in Seoul. “North Korea has the initiative. Regardless of whether conservatives or liberals are in power in South Korea, North Korea is pressing ahead with missile tests under its own weapons development timetable before it tries to tip the balance later,” said Park Won Gon, a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “North Korea will now continue its provocations, but there are no ways to stop it.” Yoon’s decision to join his first security briefing in a bunker is symbolic of his campaign pledges to take a tougher stance on North Korea after Moon’s attempts to engage with Kim failed to make progress on denuclearisation. In a recent interview with Voice of America, Yoon said that a meeting with Kim was not off the table, but would need to produce results. “There’s no reason to avoid meeting” Kim, he said. “However, if we are not be able to show any results, or results are just for show and does not have actual outcomes in denuclearisation … it’s not going to help the relationship between the two Koreas progress.” At home, where he faces a deeply divided public and a hostile national assembly controlled by the main opposition Democratic party, Yoon will be expected to tackle inflation – now at a 13-year high – that threatens his campaign pledge to address growing inequality and rising property prices in the world’s 10th biggest economy. Yoon, though, has been denied the usual honeymoon period enjoyed by new presidents. Only 55% of respondents expect him to do a good job as president – an unusually low figure compared to his predecessors – according to a poll by Gallup Korea. As Moon’s former prosecutor-general, Yoon helped investigate another former president, Park Geun-hye, before she was impeached and imprisoned in 2017 for corruption and abuse of power. He has vowed to continue the fight against corruption, even as several of his cabinet nominees were accused of ethical lapses and misconduct. Yoon will also come under pressure to address simmering resentment among young men – a key source of support in the election – over what they perceive as unfair advantages given to women, even though South Korea fares poorly in gender equality. Yoon said he would abolish the country’s gender equality ministry, but has since suggested that it is no longer a policy priority, leading to speculation that he will “rebrand” the body rather than abolish it. He has also indicated he intends to build “future-oriented” relations with Japan after years of tension linked to the countries’ bitter wartime legacy. The North-east Asian neighbours have yet to resolve disputes over the Japanese military’s use of Korean sex slaves before and during the second world war. They are also at loggerheads over compensation for Korean labourers forcibly brought to Japan during its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, and competing claims to the Takeshima islands, known as Dokdo by Koreans. In what is being seen as a sign of a possible thaw in relations, Yoon sent a delegation to Tokyo last month, while Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, was among 300 foreign guests at his swearing-in ceremony.

5/10/2022,"Farmers have been forced to dump thousands of avocados in far north Queensland because of an oversupply of the fruit and increased transportation and packaging costs. Jan De Lai, a resident of Atherton in far north Queensland, posted the photos of the discarded avocados to Facebook after finding them at the tip. “Truckloads of avocados are being dumped in Atherton! Surely they could be used for animal fodder or used to make oil?” she wrote. “Poor farmers.” The post was picked up by several news publications and sparked concerns avocado farmers were being forced to compete with international sellers. But Avocado Australia’s chairman Jim Kochi said the fruits being sold on shelves were 100% Australian at this time of year. “At this time of year, there are no imports of avocados coming into Australia,” he said. Kochi said the avocados were dumped because of an oversupply in the domestic market amid favourable growing conditions, particularly in Western Australia. “We have a fairly high supply of premium and class one avocados, and about two weeks ago, when this happened, price returns to growers were quite low,” he said. “We were back to levels we were at 20 years ago.” The high supply makes it harder for growers to justify processing lower quality avocados, Kochi said. “There has been … a lot more competition between growers and the chains,” he said. “So therefore the price was down. We were looking at fruit priced $1 when normally they could be $2 or $3 apiece.” Normally, low-grade avocados like the one’s pictured would end up in a processing facility and turned into guacamole or other products, including face masks. But Kochi said processing facilities in Queensland were full so some have ended up in green waste and turned into compost. He said growers only dump fruit as a last resort. “​​It’s not worth it anyone trying to repackage it,” he said. “Our packaging costs have doubled, transport has almost doubled, all of those handling cost have doubled. We don’t have the extra labour to handle it. “The easiest is to turn it into compost.” Woolworths and Coles confirmed they were currently only selling Australian avocados.",News/Australia news,Smashed avocados: fruit dumped in Queensland amid bumper harvest and rising transport costs,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/10/smashed-avocados-fruit-dumped-in-queensland-amid-bumper-harvest-and-rising-transport-costs

5/10/2022,"Many patients in south-west England are being left in dental pain because they are unable to register for NHS care, with some so desperate that they are even resorting to DIY treatment, it has emerged. The charity Healthwatch in Somerset has reported that it is almost impossible for a new patient to register for an NHS dentist in the county, which is leading to adults and children living in agony, self-treating, or travelling out of the area for help. Cases on its books include a woman who got her husband to pierce an abscess because she was in excruciating pain and could not find NHS treatment. “I was in tears with the pain and got my husband to burst the abscess with a needle and I then had a mouthwash with warm water and salt,” she said. A man from Bridgwater, who asked not to be named, said he recently had a large filling fall out. He was not registered with an NHS dentist and could not find one. “I went to the chemist and they gave me a product called Dentemp. The clue’s in the name, but I’ve been using it for six weeks now and will keep going with it until the pain just gets too bad.” Alan Hardcastle, 51, from Glastonbury, was upset when he was told he and his 11-year-old son had been removed from his NHS dentist’s register because they had not had an appointment since before the pandemic. The college lecturer has toothache and is struggling to find another dentist. “I’ve rung round 14 so far in Glastonbury, Street and Bridgwater. One says they can take my son on, but none will take me. I can only eat on one side of my mouth. If I have to go private, it has a massive impact on our household income, but I may have to bite the bullet.” One NHS worker has been suffering with toothache for three days. “I spent a whole day trying to find a dentist and am still in agony,” they said. “I can’t believe no dentist will see me. My NHS dentist took me off their register after 20 years of being a loyal patient. I was told there are not enough dentists in the practice now. I work for £10.18 an hour and I can’t afford private rates.” A mature student said she was experiencing pain after root canal work. She tried to register with 10 NHS surgeries in and around Taunton and was told none were accepting patients. One practice told her to check in Devon. One person who said their family had been removed from their dentist’s register during the Covid lockdown said they had rung “countless” surgeries because their daughter had an abscess. They were worried that their daughter could suffer sepsis and the blood tests she needed were being delayed. Experts in dental care said they were not surprised by the situation in Somerset. Dr Nigel Carter, CEO of the Oral Health Foundation, said the impact of factors such as Brexit and coronavirus on top of dentists’ dissatisfaction with NHS contracts and too few new dentists being trained had led to a shortage of places in NHS practices. “We’ve had a perfect storm,” he said. He said he was aware of people carrying out their own dentistry, including using temporary fillings and even extracting wobbly teeth. “We need more dentists,” he said. Carter criticised NHS England for not accepting that there was a problem in Somerset. “They are burying their heads in the sand,” he said. Eddie Crouch, the chair of the British Dental Association, said even before the pandemic people were doing round trips of 50 miles in Somerset to find an NHS dentist and more practitioners were leaving for private practice or only doing NHS work part time. NHS England insisted there were dental appointments to be found in Somerset – but did not provide figures on how many surgeries were accepting new NHS patients, saying the decision was up to individual practices. A spokesperson for NHS England and NHS Improvement South West said: “More than 550 additional urgent care appointments are available every month across Somerset to ensure those with urgent clinical need can access treatment, and community and special care services continue to treat patients. We are in the process of securing extra high street dental services across the south-west.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We’ve given the NHS £50m to fund up to 350,000 extra dental appointments and we are growing the workforce so people can get the oral care they need.”",News/Society,Dentist shortage in south-west England leaves patients doing DIY treatments,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/dental-patients-south-west-england-unable-register-nhs-treatment
5/10/2022,"Hundreds of severely mentally ill prisoners in urgent need of hospital treatment are being left in prison cells due to bed shortages in secure NHS psychiatric units, an investigation has discovered. Freedom of information (FoI) responses from 22 NHS trusts reveal for the first time that just over half of the 5,403 prisoners in England assessed by prison-based psychiatrists to require hospitalisation were not transferred between 2016 and 2021 – an 81% increase on the number of prisoners denied a transfer in the previous five years. In some areas, the majority of mentally ill prisoners were not admitted, which could be the result of long delays or a trust refusing to take certain patients. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS foundation trust, which was rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission last month, only admitted 16 of 41 prisoners referred in 2021. Essex Partnership University NHS foundation trust only admitted 24 of 57 prisoners referred in 2021. Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS foundation trust only accepted 18 of the 38 prisoners referred in 2021. Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the figures unearthed by the investigation suggested hundreds of very ill people were being denied the treatment they needed. “It is shocking that a growing number of people are not getting the transfer to hospital that clinicians say is essential for their mental health,” he said. “Instead they are languishing in often overcrowded and dilapidated prisons. It is cruel and guarantees people will leave prison in a worse state than when they came in, with every likelihood that the behaviour that originally led to their arrest and conviction will continue.” The joint investigation by the Guardian and BBC Radio 4’s File on 4 programme, which is broadcast on 10 May, also found that seriously ill prisoners faced long waits in breach of government targets. NHS guidelines state that inmates should be transferred within 28 days of an initial referral. But figures, obtained from the Ministry of Justice, show prisoners waiting as many as 104 days after the department received a formal transfer application – which doesn’t include the time it takes to assess prisoners. These delays – in which prisoners’ mental health can rapidly deteriorate, with some self-harming and others being placed in segregation cells – are often caused by a lack of suitable beds in admissions wards in secure hospitals, where sentenced prisoners have to be treated. NHS figures released under FoI rules show that all of England’s high- and medium-security hospitals were operating above the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ maximum bed occupancy rate of 85% on a single day in February. Russell Green, a consultant psychiatrist and medical director for Practice Plus Group, which provides mental health services in about 50 prisons, said he was “genuinely shocked” that so many sick prisoners were not being transferred. “The threshold for referring someone to hospital is high, so you only do it when you absolutely need to move someone,” he said. “These are people who have major psychotic illnesses or chronic personality disorders. They need specialist care, which they can’t get with the best will in the world in prison.” Psychiatrists frequently struggle to find beds for prisoners, with only the most extreme cases referred to hospital. Most prisoners with mental illness are managed on a day-to-day basis by prison officers who are usually untrained. A survey of more than 380 prison officers by the Guardian and BBC found that 84% dealt with mental health problems every day, with half seeing prisoners they believed should be in hospital, yet only 4% had adequate training. Mike Roberts, an experienced prison officer who works at an institution in the south of England, said at least a quarter of the prisoners he saw had mental health problems. But Roberts – not his real name – said that in 29 years in the service he had only been given a talk and some online “click-through PowerPoint” training about mental illness. “There aren’t that many secure units that have beds, so the prisoners are stuck in prison with us … prison officers who are not mental-health trained,” he said. Dawson said the government should focus on preventing seriously ill people from going to prison in the first place, including expanding mental health treatment orders, which only make 0.5% of community sentences. The government said it planned to change the Mental Health Act to ensure people in the criminal justice system could get the right care. “All individuals detained in custody are entitled to the same range and quality of health and social care services as individuals living in the community, including mental health services,” said a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care. “Healthcare providers in prison have robust processes in place to identify, assess and treat offenders with mental health needs.” An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS is rolling out a mental health treatment programme across England which provides courts with qualified clinical staff who offer mental health interventions and an alternative to custodial sentences.” In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

5/10/2022,"Many people with serious mental illnesses end up in prison cells – and then struggle to get transferred to hospital. The Guardian speaks to a woman imprisoned for setting fire to a cushion and a prison officer running a unit for the sickest prisoners. Shell Ball cannot remember exactly what was going through her head when she set fire to a cushion in her home in Crewe in 2019. But she had been struggling to cope with the death of her fiance, Gary, who had started drinking heavily again after they lost a baby. “I got quite drunk and I really don’t know why but I set fire to the corner of a cushion. Upstairs had heard me shouting and called the police,” she said. It was the start of a nightmare that would result in Ball – who has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD and borderline personality disorder – being imprisoned and then twice recalled to prison after attempting to take her own life. In total she would spend nearly a year and a half behind bars and lose custody of her youngest son – all for setting fire to a cushion, as a cry for help. Ball, 38, was held in a police station over that fateful weekend, charged with reckless arson. The following Monday she went to court and was remanded in HMP Styal, Cheshire – just a week after Gary had died. Ball was inconsolable. “I cried for two weeks. I just couldn’t stop crying. My world had fallen apart and now I was in prison,” she said. When her case was heard she wrote a heartfelt letter to the judge explaining what had happened in her life, from being raped as a teenager to losing a child and a partner – but she was still sent back to prison. “[The judge] said: ‘I know you didn’t have any intention of hurting anyone that night other than yourself,’ but he gave me two years.” Ball started self-harming as it gave her “some release” from the hopelessness of her situation. “There’s no light at the end of the tunnel. A lot of people in prison are the same and that’s why people kill themselves and self-harm,” she said. While she was at Styal, at least one woman died. “About 90% of the women in there had mental health issues – most probably that’s why they were in there in the first place,” she said. The prison put her on a plan for those at risk of self-harm and suicide. But she was only given the opportunity to speak to a psychiatrist on the phone just before she was released. “It was pointless.” She struggled to cope outside as she had not received any sustained treatment in prison and was recalled after two suicide attempts. Ball appealed to the Parole Board but was turned down: “How can I get recalled for trying to take my own life? How’s that criminal?” Ball was eventually released in August 2021 and has been getting her life back together. But she believes she should never have been sent to prison: “I don’t see myself as a criminal. I wanted to hurt myself. I wanted to die. I should have been sectioned in hospital and got the help I needed, which would have caused a lot less pain.” “A lot of officers avoid coming on to this [mental health] unit because they class it as the most dangerous part of the prison. You could open a door one day and the man in front of you could be nice as pie. You could open the door an hour later and he’d come out swinging punches. “Self-harm is quite high. We don’t allow them to have razors or any sharp objects. But that doesn’t stop people. We’ve had people rip wall tiles off the showers and self-harm with them. We had a guy who tried to cut his own jugular a few months back. “We see it as containment rather than any form of treatment. We keep them locked in mostly. We do let them out for a bit of association and we do take them outside for exercise. But on hospital wards they are out all day. It’s a much more relaxed environment. There are nurses to medicate them. “In prisons, we can’t always give them the same medication they were prescribed in the community because certain drugs aren’t allowed within prison walls. Opioid-based medications are banned because they become currency. “A lot of these people end up in prison due to their mental health. I’m looking at my board at the moment: from the eight that I’ve got in the unit today, there’s only one that I would say doesn’t fall into that category. There’s one in for carrying a bladed article. Another for harassment. He stood in the street shouting. He has psychosis and hears voices. Another person attacked a neighbour because he was playing music too loud. And a lot of these are under care in the community anyway, even before they come to us. They are ill. It is inhumane [to put them in prison].” The officer, who wishes to remain anonymous, works in a mental health unit in an English prison.

5/10/2022,"The public inquiry into the death in police custody of Sheku Bayoh, which starts taking evidence this week, must be a “watershed moment” with the potential to prompt a wider dialogue about racism in Scotland, campaigners have said. The hearings begin almost exactly seven years since the father-of-two died after being restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife, on 3 May 2015, and marks the first major public examination of institutional racism in Scotland since the Black Lives Matter movement galvanised around the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Bayoh died after police officers responded to reports of a black man in an agitated state carrying a knife. He was hit with batons, CS spray and pepper spray, then restrained on the pavement with wrist and leg ties. A postmortem documented 23 separate injuries to his body. A toxicology report confirmed that Bayoh had taken some drugs that night, but no bladed weapon was found. The nine officers involved, some of whom have since left the police, have always denied any wrongdoing and have not been prosecuted or disciplined for any aspect of his death. Intense pressure from Bayoh’s family, including his partner, Collette Bell, and his sister, Kadi Johnson, finally persuaded the Scottish government to announce an independent inquiry in 2019, which began gathering and reviewing tens of thousands of pieces of documentary evidence a year later. The family’s faith in the criminal justice system has been “destroyed” over the past seven years, said their solicitor, Aamer Anwar. “They believe that Sheku Bayoh was systematically criminalised and smeared in order to justify his death, and they are expecting a lot more of these attacks during the inquiry, as seems to happen whenever a black man dies in custody in the US or the UK,” said Anwar. In a move that he and the family described as “bitterly disappointing”, the inquiry chair, Lord Bracadale, asked Police Scotland and the Crown Office in March to provide undertakings the officers would not be prosecuted for individual evidence they gave his inquiry, to ensure “full, frank and uninhibited” testimony, but this request was refused. The Bayoh family have since warned that it would undermine the spirit of the inquiry if police officers resorted to “no comment” answers. Bracadale, a retired appeal court judge, previously promised an “inquisitorial” inquiry that would reinvestigate the entire case, focusing on the lead-up to police confronting Bayoh, their conduct after his death, the subsequent investigations by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner and the Crown Office, and whether racism was a factor. The first of these five blocks of evidential hearings will take place in Edinburgh from Tuesday, and members of the public can attend in person or watch them broadcast on the inquiry YouTube channel. Deborah Coles, the executive director of Inquest, which has supported the Bayoh family from the outset, said the inquiry “must be a watershed moment for Scotland in examining issues around institutional racism, police restraint practices and the flawed systems for responding to deaths”. She said it was “highly significant” that race was specifically in the terms of reference, “because that is often the elephant in the room” with such deaths. Coles noted that Tuesday’s hearing would open with a family statement. “It is important this is opening with pen portraits, which were used really well in the Grenfell and Hillsborough inquiries. It humanises the process and reminds everybody that a black man, much loved by his family, died at the hands of the state and that this needs to be properly examined.”",News/UK news,"Sheku Bayoh inquiry must be ‘watershed moment’, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/sheku-bayoh-scotland-inquiry-must-be-a-watershed-moment-say-campaigners
5/10/2022,"The international aviation industry has failed to meet all but one of 50 of its own climate targets in the past two decades, environment campaigners say. A report commissioned by the climate charity Possible assessed every target set by the industry since 2000 and found that nearly all had been missed, revised or quietly ignored. The charity says the findings undermine a UK government plan to leave airlines to reduce their emissions through self-regulation. Leo Murray, Possible’s director of innovation, said: “This forensic investigation shows just how implausible and credulous the government’s jet-zero strategy is shaping up to be. How can we credibly expect this industry to overdeliver on emissions reduction when they’ve never met any of their previous climate targets? “It’s clear that we need to demand reduction via a frequent flyer levy, which would discourage the frequent flying by a small group of people which makes up the bulk of emissions from planes.” Air travel accounted for 2.1% of human-produced carbon dioxide emissions in 2019, equivalent to about 915m tonnes, according to the Air Transport Action Group. It is estimated that 15% of people take 70% of all flights, Possible says. The air targets report was written by researchers from the sustainability agency Green Gumption, who examined climate targets starting and finishing between 2000 and 2021, and assessed progress against some longer-term goals. They found that unclear definitions, opaque monitoring and inconsistent reporting made many targets difficult to assess, with many also suddenly changed, replaced or dropped within the study period. Moreover, even if the targets had been met, the researchers said, many were insufficiently ambitious to reduce aviation’s climate impact. In 2007 Virgin Atlantic set a target of a 30% reduction in CO2 per revenue tonne kilometre (CO2/RTK) by 2020, which the company later described as “a big target and we’re sticking with it”, according to the report. In a 2014 sustainability report, with a reduction in CO2/RTK of only 8% from baseline, the airline admitted: “We’re nearly halfway through our target period and know we have to pick up the pace.” But when Virgin’s 2020 annual report was published, it no longer mentioned the 2020 target. The following year, a press release from the company announced a new target of 15% gross reduction in CO2/RTK by 2026. The researchers conclude that climate target setting is in effect a smokescreen for business as usual. Such targets “appear to function principally as a tactic for giving an impression of progress and action to address aviation’s environmental impacts to the public and policymakers, in order to prevent any policy barriers to ongoing growth in the industry”, the report says. It includes a quote from Steve Ridgway, Virgin’s chief executive in 2007, who said: “It is important that the airline industry is being seen to do something.” The government’s jet-zero strategy is due to be published in July and is expected to defy guidance from the climate change committee that deliberate policies will be needed to manage growth in demand for air travel in order to meet the UK’s net-zero goals. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “This report wilfully ignores this government’s historic investment in technology, fuel and market-based measures which will help us reach jet zero by 2050 without the need for further taxes. This includes £180m to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel and £685m to develop zero-carbon and low-emission aircraft technology.” The Guardian has contacted Virgin Atlantic for comment.",News/Environment,"Just one of 50 aviation industry climate targets met, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/just-one-of-50-aviation-industry-climate-targets-met-study-finds
5/10/2022,"Britain’s cybersecurity unit has reported a record crackdown on internet scams after tackling more than 2.7m attempted frauds last year, a near-fourfold increase on the figure for 2020. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), an arm of the GCHQ spy agency, said the interrupted scams included fake celebrity endorsements and bogus extortion emails. It stressed, however, that the increase in detection reflected aggressive targeting by the unit rather than an increase in scams. Lindy Cameron, the NCSC’s chief executive, said one foiled scam involved a fraudster attempting to impersonate her. “We know that scammers will go to great lengths, and indeed my name has been used to try to trick people, but as we continue to expand our defences we can see the tangible impact this is having,” she said. The scams were tackled under the agency’s active cyberdefence programme, which targets high-volume attacks on members of the public, companies and organisations. The attacks include phishing campaigns in which the victim is tricked, often via email, into downloading malware or handing over their login details. Covid-19 triggered a surge in NHS-related scams, the NCSC said. It removed more than 1,400 NHS-themed phishing campaigns last year, an 11-fold increase on 2020, including fake messages about vaccine rollouts and certificates. The attempted Cameron scam was a fake email purporting to be from the NCSC chief informing the recipient that the unit had prevented £5m of their money from being stolen and that they should reply with personal information to get it back. The fake celebrity endorsements included a “special report”, published on a fake BBC news page, with the headline “Jeremy Clarkson gives British people the opportunity to make millions from home”, illustrated with photos not of the former Top Gear host but of the This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield instead. The other type of scam targeted aggressively by the NCSC last year, bogus extortion emails, involve falsely claiming a victim’s email has been hacked and saying they need to pay money. Scam adverts will be included in the scope of the forthcoming online safety bill, meaning that the largest social media platforms will be required to prevent paid-for fraudulent adverts appearing on their sites.

We like public figures who seem, not down to earth exactly, but familiar; people you can picture eating dinner on their laps in front of Coronation Street with a glass of Blossom Hill. We enjoy the delusion that the only difference between us and someone on TV is a lottery win. This is why the battle between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy has gripped our attention for two and a half years and counting. A tale of two Wags, Rooney v Vardy is the perfect storm of everyday pettiness and high-profile drama. On both sides are women who married into the public eye – through the former England player Wayne Rooney and Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy, respectively. Much like reality TV stars, the Wags’ relationship to the British tabloids is as symbiotic as it is stressful. Stories about anything from a new haircut to taking placenta pills fill the pages of the red tops. The content keeps their names relevant but also open to constant public scrutiny. Throughout the 2010s, Rooney was a common presence in the Sun newspaper, where her private information as well as that of friends and family kept appearing unexpectedly. While some Wags trailed information of their lives to the press to increase their profiles, these stories were unwanted by Rooney. There was, it seems, someone in her close circle of friends leaking the stories to the press. So, in an act of digital sleuthing that has since led her to be dubbed “Wagatha Christie”, Rooney started posting fake personal news to Instagram Stories and blocked all but one person from seeing them. The stories ranged from believable to clickbait: she was making a return to TV; she was left devastated after Storm Lorenzo flooded the basement of her £20m family home; she was travelling to Mexico to look into gender selection treatment. All of them found their way into the paper. On 9 October 2019, Rooney posted her findings on Twitter, announcing that “it’s .......... Rebekah Vardy’s account”. She dropped this bombshell while Vardy, who is now suing for defamation, was heavily pregnant and on holiday. Almost three years later, the libel trial will begin at the high court in London today and is scheduled to last for six days. The news around it is already frenzied, with legal fees reaching millions, fears of “shredded” reputations, and vows never to speak to each other again. Beyond that, there are shock revelations and elements of intrigue that Agatha Christie herself would have been proud to write. The trial hasn’t even started and already Vardy has made allegations in court papers, pointing the finger at her press agent, Caroline Watt, while mystery circulates about a phone that “regrettably” fell into the North Sea along with the WhatsApp messages that may have contained pivotal evidence for Rooney’s case. This trial is arguably so explosive because of the appetite the British press has for criticising women it sees as having “climbed” their way into wealth. Vardy grew up in a troubled home, and by the age of 15 she was homeless. Rooney, whose mum was a cleaner and dad a boxing coach, came from a working-class background. Both were catapulted to fame and money through their marriages, and have been treated as undeserving recipients with headlines such as “Rebekah Vardy to splash out on a new pair of boobs with I’m A Celebrity fee” and “Coleen and Wayne Rooney hit the beach in Mykonos for ANOTHER holiday just days after returning from Barbados”. But the public don’t seem to share this disdain and there seems to be an enormous amount of goodwill towards both Rooney and Vardy for providing us with so much entertainment. When news articles contain the phrase “mansion in Lincolnshire” and a text that says “Stupid cow deserves everything she gets!”, it’s impossible not to be drawn in as if it’s an episode of Footballers’ Wives writ large. There’s something quintessentially English, almost old fashioned, about this feud. It’s like a period drama with balayage and Botox. Ultimately, this whole affair gives us a window into the lives of the rich, and what we see is that they’re just like us. This is not a high-end courtroom drama; it’s turbocharged comment section warfare. And, against this recognisable backdrop of online drama and broken friendships, there is the knowledge that, if you had £3m to escalate a personal beef to the highest possible court, you could find yourself on the stand too.

5/10/2022,"An SAS soldier has backed Ben Roberts-Smith’s version of an Afghan man’s death during an SAS mission in Darwan in 2012, telling the federal court that a man shot dead during the operation was an insurgent spotter who was a threat to Australian troops and legitimately killed. Roberts-Smith and his former comrade, Person 11, are accused by three newspapers as part of their defence of Roberts-Smith’s defamation claim against them of a “joint criminal enterprise” in the murder of an Afghan farmer named Ali Jan, who the newspapers allege was handcuffed before being kicked off a cliff by Roberts-Smith and then shot dead by either or both of Roberts-Smith and Person 11. Person 11, called as a witness by Roberts-Smith, gave extensive evidence to the court on the mission to Darwan on 11 September 2012. He said the man killed at the end of that mission was an insurgent spotter found hiding in a cornfield who the Australian soldiers discovered and “engaged” when they walked out of a dry creek bed into the cornfield. “Shortly after coming out of the dry creek bed I identified an individual in amongst the corn,” Person 11 told the court. “My assessment was this individual was moving in a very suspicious manner. “I saw this person carrying a radio, which led me to make the assessment that this was a spotter: this person would report on our dispositions and movements … I assessed this person posed a direct threat to the extraction of our forces so I engaged.” Person 11’s version of events largely aligns with that of Roberts-Smith. But the two soldiers’ versions of events are not identical. Person 11 said the man shot in the cornfield was “15 metres away”. Roberts-Smith, when he gave evidence last year, told the court, he climbed the embankment to confront the man, “facing him, he was two metres away”. The alleged murder of Ali Jan is the most notorious allegation of a sprawling and complex defamation case, which has spent nearly a year before the federal court. The newspapers allege as part of their defence the murder was a “joint criminal enterprise” between Roberts-Smith and his subordinate, Person 11. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australian SAS patrols raided the village of Darwan, in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province, on 11 September 2012, seeking a rogue Afghan soldier called Hekmatullah, who had killed three Australian soldiers three weeks earlier. Hekmatullah was not in Darwan. At the end of the mission, the newspapers allege that a farmer called Ali Jan – visiting Darwan to buy flour – was taken into custody and handcuffed by the Australian soldiers. After Ali Jan laughed while being interrogated, Roberts-Smith is alleged to have marched him outside to the edge of a small cliff where he forced Ali Jan to kneel and then “kicked him hard in the midriff, causing him to fall back over the cliff and land in the dry creek bed below”. “The impact of the fall to the dry creek below was so significant that it knocked Ali Jan’s teeth out of his mouth,” the newspapers’ defence states. Two Afghan witnesses and one Australian soldier have also given evidence they saw Roberts-Smith, or a “big soldier” matching his description, kick the man off the cliff. One Australian soldier, Person 4, told the court: “I saw the individual smash his face on a rock, and I saw the teeth explode out of his face.” According to the newspapers’ defence, Ali Jan did not die in the fall, but was then dragged into a cornfield and shot dead. The newspapers allege: “After Ali Jan had fallen the full height of the cliff down to the dry creek bed he was moved by two soldiers … to the other side of the creek bed where there was vegetation. After he had been moved … Ali Jan was shot multiple times in the presence of [Roberts-Smith] and Person 11.” It is alleged Ali Jan was shot by either or both of Roberts-Smith and Person 11 – “a joint criminal enterprise” according to the newspapers’ defence before court. The newspapers also allege that both soldiers knew his death was unlawful, and tried to cover it up by placing a radio on his body to establish a post-facto justification for killing him as a “spotter”. Person 4 also told the court Roberts-Smith instructed him and Person 11 to drag the man across a dry creek bed towards the adjacent cropfields. Person 4 said Roberts-Smith and Person 11 had a conversation before “a number of shots rang out”. He testified he saw Person 11 with his rifle raised in a firing position after he heard the shots. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied this account, telling the court there were no “fighting aged males” found at the farthest compounds of the village. Roberts-Smith said the Australian troops were moving towards a helicopter landing site to be extracted from the village when they encountered a spotter – a forward scout who reports soldiers’ movements back to insurgents – discovered hiding in a cornfield by Person 11, who immediately opened fire upon the insurgent.

Roberts-Smith told the court: “As I got there, he [Person 11] was engaging and I started to engage an individual that … was either going down or was down, and I fired three to five rounds …, from my recollection, into the individual as well and saw dust and strike on the ground around him, suggesting that either my bullets were hitting him or very close to him. “Person 11 had identified that that person was a spotter and, on searching the individual, we found an ICOM radio.” Person 11’s account in court Tuesday backed Roberts-Smith’s account, saying as he was firing at the insurgent “there was fire from another weapon coming from my rear right, that I later understood was coming from Mr Roberts-Smith”. He told the court insurgent attacks were common at “insertion and extraction” from operations, and that moving towards extraction points was a period of “vulnerability” for troops. Person 11 remains in the witness box, giving evidence-in-chief before Justice Anthony Besanko.",News/Australia news,SAS soldier tells Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial Afghan killed in Darwan was an insurgent spotter,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/sas-soldier-tells-ben-roberts-smith-defamation-trial-afghan-killed-in-darwan-was-an-insurgent-spotter
5/10/2022,"Election campaigns are like kaleidoscopes: when you twist, a different picture comes into view. As prepoll voting started on Monday, reports started rolling in from across the country about the how-to-vote cards of Clive Palmer’s United Australia party. The UAP was recommending preferencing the Liberals and Nationals ahead of Labor in a number of key marginal electorates – including Bass, Chisholm, McEwen, Reid and Parramatta. At one level, this potential boost for Scott Morrison’s re-election prospects wasn’t a surprise – did anyone ever think Palmer would try to help a Labor government get elected? But Monday’s reality was measurably different from what the UAP had flagged for months when it said all incumbents would be preferenced last. By Monday night, Katherine Deves, the Liberal candidate for Warringah – last seen being bundled into a lift to evade the questions of waiting reporters – had also bobbed up on Sky News. Deves walked back her apology for offensive comments about transgender children. This controlled detonation catalysed another news cycle. As the perspicacious ABC commentator Annabel Crabb pointed out on Tuesday, Deves has managed to generate a “fakenado of developments” over the course of this campaign, making statements, apologising for them, then fine-tuning the apology – all with an outsized level of media attention given no policy change is in contemplation. Morrison, who handpicked Deves to run just weeks out from the start of the campaign, has repeatedly defended his Warringah candidate and did so again on Tuesday. “We’re talking about gender reversal surgery for young adolescents and we can’t pretend this is not a serious, significant issue,” Morrison told reporters. The prime minister was entirely untroubled by the factual inconvenience that you have to be over 18, and therefore an adult, to get the procedure. I know there has been well-founded disgust for some weeks about Morrison’s performative punching down on a vulnerable community just to generate a slice of campaign outrage sufficiently potent to cut through the noise of a contested election. So what I’m about to say next is diagnostic – it doesn’t condone political dog-whistling. To understand the strategy (and there certainly is one) we need to be clear and candid about prime ministerial methodology. The trans community might be victims of this crass, confected, imported, culture war – but that community isn’t the prime minister’s target. What Morrison is trying to execute with this entirely engineered conversation is narrowcasting to parents troubled about the shifting cultural and social mores their kids are coming of age in. Morrison researches everything, but he doesn’t need a focus group to tell him how anxious parents think because, fundamentally, he is one of those parents. That’s why we are stuck in this campaign cul-de-sac. If the last campaign was about the quiet Australians, Morrison desperately wants this one to be about the anxious ones. The prime minister wants to style himself as the champion of all anxious parents, and most particularly, the anxious parents currently contemplating a protest vote against his government – which brings us back to Palmer and how-to-vote cards. Some of Morrison’s anxious parents are religious or socially conservative. And some of the people he’s targeting with this who will think of our vulnerable children in an age such as this messaging happen to live in the suburban electorates where Palmer preferences just might help Liberals to either hold or win seats. Neat, huh? This is not a cost-free strategy, of course, and the cost (apart from the wellbeing of the trans community) could be a number of Liberal moderates in the so-called “teal” inner-city seats. But Morrison is no help to these moderates anyway – he’s irredeemably toxic for their campaigns – and it is now clear the prime minister is trying to hold on to government by gaining seats in the places where old mate Clive is helping. Looping back to our campaign kaleidoscope, a couple of other things were visible on Tuesday. Morrison appeared in Sydney for his hustings event with the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet. The premier evidently felt absolutely zero pressure to give the prime minister any political comfort. Perrottet, who is one of only two Liberal premiers left in the country, professed support for shared equity housing affordability schemes despite Morrison labelling Labor’s policy a “forced-to-buy” scheme. The premier also did little to paper over differences with Morrison when it came to anti-corruption bodies. What Tuesday’s gritted-teeth Liberal tableau reinforced is this: if Morrison is going to find the goat track to win this election, he’ll be doing it alone. His treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is pinned down in his Melbourne seat trying to hold on, and evidently worried enough about his prospects to be actively differentiating himself from the prime minister he once bunked in with at the Lodge. Perrottet certainly isn’t going to be furnishing any glowing endorsements. Morrison won’t mind the lack of kinship at a psychological level because he possesses other deep comforts – and temperamentally he’s a command-and-control sort. He’s also found the necessary electoral goat track solo before. But there was a significant contrast with Anthony Albanese’s hustings event on Tuesday. The Labor leader has now been endorsed by the still popular Mark McGowan, and the newly minted South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, as well as Annastacia Palaszczuk and Daniel Andrews. Albanese did manage to get himself in another rhetorical tangle, this time about whether or not he’d support an increase to the minimum wage in theory or in practice. But Andrews was so enthusiastic about his character endorsement that the federal Labor leader had to cue him to move aside so he could have the microphone. Albanese’s campaign commitment was more than $2bn towards Melbourne’s suburban rail loop. “Every federal dollar that Victorians get from the miserable Morrison government … we ought to bow our head and treat it like it’s foreign aid,” Andrews thundered. “We have been ripped off by this Liberal-National government. Anthony Albanese is about building things. He’s about partnership. He’s about creating jobs. He’s about making sure that our cities and regions, our nation, actually works.” So while Morrison looks isolated, Albanese doesn’t lack kinship. Institutional Labor is rallying across the country to change the federal government. If Labor can generate the kind of national “it’s time” swing that published opinion polls are currently tracking, then this contest is already over. But Morrison’s narrowcasting speaks to a more bespoke campaign: one where the next government of Australia will be decided after a mud-fight in a handful of marginal seats, and one where the result ultimately turns on the sentiment of anxious Australians – the voters who the prime minister has been courting almost exclusively since he fired the starter’s gun four weeks ago.",News/Australia news,"If the last campaign targeted the quiet Australians, this time Morrison is appealing to the anxious ones | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/if-the-last-campaign-targeted-the-quiet-australians-this-time-morrison-is-appealing-to-the-anxious-ones
5/10/2022,"It was International Dawn Chorus Day and we were at Loch Insh by 6am for an RSPB guided walk. The birds in the car park were putting on a good show, and already we hit the challenge of the morning. Our guide would point and say: “That’s a chaffinch!” No sooner had everyone turned their heads and tuned their ears, a pesky band of tits, warblers and robins would pipe up and confuse things. Which one was which? How do you describe birdsong? So walking, we collectively tried to capture elusive bird language in human tongue. To remember and imitate the songs, the rhythm and emphasis are as important as the pitch. The willow warbler has a pure and silvery tumble of notes, with a bright lift at the end, so we tried “willow-willow-willow-willow WARbler!” The great tit’s rusty-wheel two notes are often captioned “teacher-teacher” but don’t sound a bit like that to me. I scribbled down “du-WIT du-WIT”. But that’s what an owl says, isn’t it? With a “woo” thrown in? Bother. Not as easy as it looks. The singing birds are mostly males marking territory and attracting females, which is why they strike up with such gusto in the spring and all talk at the same time. The tiny wrens are invariably surprising with their volume and velocity, and I found a swift roll of tongue against teeth was a close approximation of their churring. A blackcap pierced the foliage with its clear, sweet whistle, bouncing across many notes like a piccolo soloist on speed, while oystercatchers piped across the loch, sounding like miniature trucks backing up. And then the curlew lifted from the rushes with its lovely bubbling song. One bird book renders its call as “oo-ot, oo-ot oo-eet trru-ee trrru-eel trrrru-eel trrru-eel trrru-uhl”. The song thrush took the prize for operatic range and chutzpah, while the mistle thrush, someone reported, sounds like Adele. Our guide said the robin’s song has a melancholy feel and was astonished when others in the group assured him it was upbeat. To think, all these years when her singing made him sad, she had been trying to cheer him up. Clearly, there’s more to bird talk than meets the ear.
