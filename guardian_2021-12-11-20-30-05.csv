12/11/2021,"Winter is prime shellfish season in the British Isles, so it never ceases to amaze me that we don’t make a bigger fuss of this brilliant native produce over the Christmas period. It’s also incredibly easy and quick to cook, making it a great choice for feeding a crowd, whether that’s in the form of traditional moules marinière (crusty bread obligatory), grilled scallops (ideally topped with garlic butter, parsley, a splash of white wine or vermouth, and a few breadcrumbs; you can thank me later) or a no-fuss chowder; even the no-bake clam pizzas below are way less work than you’d ever expect. So let’s get shucking.  The joy of chowders lies not just in their incredible flavour – plump shellfish, salty bacon, rich, creamy broth: what’s not to like? – but in the fact that they’re so damned easy to scale up or down, depending on how many people you have around. Keep a big pot of the soup warm on a very low heat, stick a ladle in the middle of the pot, have a pile of bowls and some good crusty bread next to the stove, and leave everyone to help themselves. I especially love this with fried bread and lots of parsley. Prep 15 minCook 45 minServes 4 1kg live mussels1 glass (175ml) white wine50g butter1 small white onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped100g smoked bacon, finely chopped75ml dry sherry1 tbsp flour300ml milk300ml double cream2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into roughly 15mm dice1 big handful curly parsley, chopped, to finishSalt and freshly ground white pepperTabasco, to season and finish Put a large pot on a medium-high heat, add the mussels and wine, cover and leave for three or four minutes, shaking the pan every now and then, until they all steam open (discard any that don’t). Take off the heat, leave to cool, then pick the meat from the shells (which can now be discarded), and set aside with the cooking liquor. Melt the butter in a second large pot on a medium heat, then gently fry the onion and garlic for 10 or so minutes, until soft but not coloured. Add the bacon and saute, stirring, until just starting to crisp at the edges. Add the sherry, leave to bubble until the alcohol’s boiled off, then stir in the flour and cook out, still stirring, for a couple of minutes more. Slowly add the milk and cream, stir to combine, then add the potatoes and cook on a medium-low heat for 15 minutes, just until they are soft. Add the picked mussels and their cooking juices, simmer for a couple of minutes to warm through, then stir in the parsley. Season with white pepper and Tabasco to taste, and add salt only if needed.

I thought it was genius, and even more so when I found out it worked. If you prefer folded pizza, just fold it over before cooking and enjoy a “clamzone” instead. Prep 15 minProve 2 hr+Cook 45 minServes 4 For the dough500g strong, white bread flour325g tepid water7g dried yeast1 tbsp olive oil5g salt5g sugar For the sauce1kg live clams100ml white wine1 bay leaf1 peperoncino, or 1 dried red chilli20g butter20g flour200ml milk2 garlic cloves, peeled1 handful curly parsley, chopped1-2 tsp grated parmesan1 x 125-150g mozzarella ball, roughly torn into smallish pieces Put the flour, water, yeast, olive oil, salt and sugar in a bowl, and mix with your hands until it all comes together into a dough. Tip out on a lightly floured work surface and knead for about five minutes, until the dough is nice and elastic. Return to the bowl, cover and leave to rest for about an hour to an hour and a half, until doubled in size. Once the dough has proved, knock it back on a floured worktop, divide into four and pinch and shape each portion into a neat ball. Cover again with a towel, and leave to prove for another 30 minutes or so. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Put a large saucepan on a medium-high heat, add the clams, wine, bay and chilli, cover and steam for two or three minutes, until all the clams have opened (discard any that haven’t). Take off the heat, leave to cool, then pick the meat from the shells (these can now be discarded) and set aside with the cooking liquor. Melt the butter in a small pan, then stir in the flour until the mix thickens and forms a roux. Mix the clam juices and milk in a jug or bowl, then pour into the roux and cook, stirring, for three to four minutes, until you have a thick white sauce. Grate in the garlic, stir in the parsley and simmer for another three or four minutes, until the sauce is smooth, creamy and quite thick. Off the heat, stir in the clam meat. On a lightly floured surface, either by hand or with a rolling pin, shape each ball of dough into a disc big enough to fit your frying pan (you’ll need a heavy-based, ovenproof one). With your hands, push up a slightly raised rim all around the edge. Meanwhile, set the ovenproof frying pan over a high heat and, once it’s good and hot, lay in one round of dough. Spread the clam sauce liberally over the top and up to but not over the rim, then sprinkle over some parmesan and dot liberally with mozzarella. Leave to cook in the hot pan for four to five minutes, until the base is crisp and the edges start to rise. Meanwhile, heat the grill to high. Transfer the pan to the hot grill and cook for two or three minutes, until the edges rise and blister and the cheese melts and browns. When your pizza looks full of appeal, take it out and serve. Repeat with the remaining dough and sauce, until you’re full or until you run out of both.

12/11/2021,"For the first and perhaps the only time in his pugnacious political career, the California congressman and noted Trump apologist Devin Nunes is inspiring some kind of unanimity across party lines. When news broke on Monday that Nunes was retiring from Congress to become chief executive of the fledgling Trump Media & Technology Group, nobody on the left or the right doubted he’d landed where he belonged. After 19 years as a reliably rock-ribbed Republican legislator, Nunes told his supporters that he wasn’t giving up on fighting his political enemies, just “pursuing it by other means” – and for once those enemies took him at his word.  Even Kevin McCarthy, the top-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives and a fellow Californian, failed to raise any hackles when he said in a statement that nobody was better prepared than Nunes to lead an alternative to America’s tech and media giants. Nunes, after all, has spent years filing lawsuits against Twitter, the Washington Post, and a clutch of other media companies that he, and Trump, consider to be part of a “propaganda machine” for the Democrats. In many ways, Nunes is embracing the role his detractors have long accused him of playing, as Trump’s ultimate yes man. Early in the Trump presidency, leading Democrats fumed that he was walking away from his grave responsibilities as chair of the House intelligence committee to be Trump’s “stooge” and “fixer”. Now, though, he is walking away from Congress to serve Trump, without pretending that anything else is at stake. Both sides also broadly agree that Nunes’s surprise career move is a sign of the times. A generation ago, no politician of either party would have given up on the prospect of chairing the House ways and means committee, a job that would have been Nunes’s for the taking if the Republicans were to win next year’s congressional midterms. The position is often described as the best in Washington, because of the sweeping power it grants over a wide range of policy issues. Nunes, however, appears to have calculated that in today’s Republican party the real power lies not in committee but in proximity to the former president, who remains the GOP’s undisputed kingmaker and may harbor ambitions to be more than that as the 2024 presidential election draws closer. Nunes went out his way, while intelligence committee chair, to clear Trump of accusations of collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign and promptly turned around to investigate the FBI’s reasons for looking into the matter in the first place. Trump rewarded him with a presidential Medal of Freedom, praising his “fortitude to take on the media, the FBI, the intelligence community, the Democrat party, foreign spies, and the full power of the Deep State”. Nunes, 48, is in many ways a poster child for the notion that, in today’s politics, extreme partisanship pays. While his unwavering allegiance to Trump and frequent spouting of freewheeling conspiracy theories caused his popularity in the agricultural district he represents in California’s Central Valley to nosedive – his margin of victory plummeted from 35 percentage points in 2016 to single digits in 2018 and 2020 – his Trump bona fides have made him a formidable fundraiser. Ahead of last year’s congressional race, he raised a whopping $26.8m, the fourth-largest haul of any House member, and he used much of that money to outspend his spirited Democratic challenger, Phil Arballo, by a margin of four to one. Like the man he is going to work for, Nunes has made a career out of divisiveness. He slams the Democrats as socialists and also as the party of the capitalist elite and doesn’t blink at the contradiction. A sampling of recent media appearances, many of them on his own podcast, has him accusing China of being “behind” the Covid-19 pandemic, lambasting the National Security Agency for mounting what he claims to be a political witch hunt against Republicans, and belittling Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as mere “avatars” for Barack Obama. Some of that divisiveness, and the chaos that often erupts in its wake, is likely to greet him as he starts his new job. Two financial regulatory agencies are already investigating a $1.25bn business deal to take the Trump Media & Technology Group public. Nunes and Trump are spoiling for fights with Twitter, which banned the former president from its site in the wake of the 6 January Capitol riot, and a number of other social media platforms they accuse of censoring free speech. That accusation is not without irony for Nunes, who has attempted to silence two detractors on Twitter with the spoof handles @DevinNunesCow and @DevinNunesMom. In a widely ridiculed 2019 lawsuit, he demanded $250m in damages from Twitter and the people behind the handles because, he said, they’d meant to cause him “immense pain”. In California’s 22nd congressional district, the news of Nunes’ departure caused little detectable dismay among his supporters and was greeted by his detractors with both relief and frustration (relief because they say that he has long since placed his political ambitions above the interests of his constituents, frustration because local Democrats believed they had a decent shot at unseating him next year). Nunes, his 2020 challenger Arballo tweeted, “is fleeing from Congress at the end of the month because he would rather cash out and take a cushy gig from Trump than face our movement in a tough reelection campaign.” With California, and the rest of the country, redrawing district maps in the wake of the latest US census, Nunes was heading into a significantly tougher electoral environment. According to the latest provisional map, the 22nd would flip from one that voted to reelect Trump by five percentage points last year to one that voted for Biden by nine points. Nunes had some options if he’d chosen to fight for reelection, since California law does not oblige candidates for office to live in their districts. He could have challenged a Republican incumbent in an adjacent district or contested an open seat further away. Instead, Nunes has responded to the siren call of a man who once flattered him into thinking he “may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero”. Trump’s business ventures have rarely ended happily for those he has roped into helping run them, but his political fortunes have yet to run dry.",News/US news,Trump’s ultimate yes man: how Devin Nunes embraced the role he was long accused of playing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/11/devin-nunes-trump-republican-yes-man-congress
12/11/2021,"Aman like Yuk Luzn Man simply does not retire. From the age of 14, Man always worked. In his twenties he moved to the UK from Hong Kong to work in his brother’s fish and chip shop in Southend. His memories of that time are of a permanent, fugue-like exhaustion borne of 12-hour days behind the counter, interrupted only by sleep. Later, Man worked as a chef at Chinese restaurants across the country: in Manchester, Crawley, Norwich. His last job in catering was at a casino restaurant in Southend. It paid only the minimum wage and the hours were bad – 6pm-2am – but there weren’t many other jobs available. In 2015, at the age of 66, Man finally retired. A lifetime of hard work, with burning shoulders, aching feet and wrists sore from endless chopping, was finally at an end. Man could relax.  He lasted two months. “I’d wake up in the morning,” he says, “and think, what should I do today?” Even though Man was now living in London, he would drive to Southend to catch up with his old colleagues at the casino – but most of the time they were too busy to hang out. Which is how Man found himself volunteering three days a week at the London Chinese Community Centre, a maze of rooms overlooking Leicester Square. Now 72, Man does whatever jobs the centre asks of him, without complaint. “I always have a list,” laughs manager Beverley Lin. “He might roll his eyes but he’ll always do it all.” Man cooks food for the centre’s lunch club. He does odd jobs, like setting up rooms for classes, and even hanging pictures. He answers emails. He paints walls, although he finds that task particularly boring. He is, by a million miles, Lin’s most hardworking volunteer. “A lot of volunteers will call two minutes before they’re supposed to arrive to say they can’t make it,” says Lin. Never Man. “If he says he’s here, he’s here. I don’t have to worry.” Too much leisure time, Man thinks, is bad for the soul. It’s better to keep busy. “I’m helping others,” he says, “but in a way I’m helping myself.” Man was born in Hong Kong, the sixth of 13 children. His parents ran a grocery store but money was tight. Man was pulled out of school at 14, but wasn’t too bothered about finishing his education. “I didn’t work hard at school,” he laughs. “I wanted to go out and make money.” When he arrived in the UK in 1975, the first thing he noticed was the cold. And the church bells: it seemed like everyone went to church on Sunday. At weekends, the streets were quiet compared with the bustle of Hong Kong. There was racism, of course. “Older people,” he says, “when they walked past me, they’d spit. Not at me. But next to me.” In his heart, Man still feels like a Hongkonger. He misses his siblings at home, and the community centre helps him feel connected. The centre was founded in 1980 primarily as a place where immigrants from Hong Kong – hardly any other Chinese people were able to move to the UK at that time – could get support with translating legal documents and accessing benefits. With successive waves of migration – including students from China coming to study at British universities – the centre’s remit has expanded. It helps diaspora kids connect with their heritage; it’s a social hub for the older generation; and it assuages university students’ homesickness. Man is a sort of authority figure. He chastises the elders when they gossip about other members. “I remind them,” Man says, “that it’s not good to speak in that way.” During the pandemic, the centre’s role was more critical than ever. Many of the older members lived alone – heartbreakingly, Lin’s team discovered some of them dead in their homes from the virus – and there was a wave of anti-Asian hate crime. “The centre is very important for people’s wellbeing – especially the elderly members,” Man says. Man has rarely earned above the minimum wage, and when he had cash in his pocket, he had no time to spend it. “I always had to work,” he says, “and didn’t have time to do anything. Now I have time, but don’t have the money!” He has always wanted to try the Royal China restaurant in Canary Wharf, which is famous for its dim sum. The Royal China offered Man a £100 voucher, which the Guardian matches, and he headed there one evening in late October for a special meal. Man had hoped to take his wife, but she had a cold, so Man, Lin and other volunteers from the centre enjoyed some of London’s finest Chinese food. “I loved the location and the meal,” says Man. “The food was fantastic. Especially the peking duck and stir-fried beef.” Ever the chef, even in retirement, Man explained how each dish was made, to the amusement of his dining companions. Lin relished the opportunity to get to know her most faithful volunteer better. “He talked about all the places he grew up,” says Lin, “and what it was like, and what he did as a child. It was so nice, to spend some time together away from the centre.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?
