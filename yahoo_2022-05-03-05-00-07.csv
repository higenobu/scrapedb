5/3/2022,"KHARKIV, Ukraine (AP) ‚Äî The outskirts of Kharkiv have the feel of an open-air morgue, where the dead lie unclaimed and unexplained, sometimes for weeks on end, as Ukrainian and Russian forces fight for control of slivers of land. There is the charred body of a man, unidentifiable, propped on an anti-tank barrier made of crossed I-beams outside a town that has been under the control of both sides in recent days. There are the dead soldiers, apparently Russian, four of them arranged in a Z like the military symbol found on Russian armored vehicles, visible to the Russian drones that continuously buzz overhead. The door to an apartment opens to three bodies inside. Precisely how any of this happened will likely never be known. Kharkiv, Ukraine‚Äôs second-largest city, has been under sustained Russian attack since the beginning of the war in late February. With the Russian offensive intensifying in the east, the Russian onslaught has grown fiercer. Considered a strategic and industrial prize, territory on the eastern city‚Äôs outskirts has gone back and forth between Russian and Ukrainian forces for weeks now as the fighting shifts from village to village. Many, but by no means all, of Kharkiv‚Äôs 1 million residents have fled. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies formed into a Z, wearing the white arm bands commonly used by Russian soldiers, and with some Russian medical kits alongside. They were found on a front line where fighting had been taking place for days. They, along with the burned man, were taken to a morgue on Monday. There was no explanation for the Z formation ‚Äî a symbol of the Russian invasion ‚Äî nor the burned body propped on the barrier. Either could be considered a war crime, for disrespecting the dignity of the dead. Next will come the investigation into their identities, maybe an attempt to notify family. But even that is hard to untangle. The body of a man with Ukrainian insignia turned out to have the identity papers of a Russian soldier. The apartment where the three bodies were found had been badly shelled, but it wasn't clear what killed them. Shelling and airstrikes are a daily threat everywhere here, to everyone. And, as long as that remains true, death can come at anytime, without anyone around to answer why. It was a rare glimpse into the death and atrocities of the war. Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in eastern Ukraine has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for journalists to move around. Russia has severely restricted reporting in the combat zone; Ukraine's government has imposed fewer limits, mostly on how quickly material can be published or about military installations. According to the Red Cross, mutilating dead bodies in international armed conflicts is covered by the war crime of ‚Äúcommitting outrages upon personal dignity‚Äù under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, which according to the Elements of Crimes also applies to dead persons.",World/Associated Press,"Death in Ukraine's Kharkiv is everywhere, rarely explained",https://news.yahoo.com/death-ukraines-kharkiv-everywhere-rarely-194836803.html
5/3/2022,"After the death of Marine Corps Capt. Ross Reynolds during a training exercise in Norway on March 18, widow Lana Reynolds found herself not only grappling with the devastation of loss but also with financial burdens, according to her father, Tom Wando. The couple were married on Feb. 9, four days before the 27-year-old Marine's deployment to Norway. Wando set up a GoFundMe page April 25 to raise funds for the home mortgage, a school loan and a car loan. Wando said he set the fundraiser‚Äôs goal at $400,000 to match what his daughter would‚Äôve received if she were the designated beneficiary of his policy with Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, which provides life insurance for active-duty service members. Wando said that in January, when Reynolds, of Leominster, was made aware of his deployment to Norway, he had designated someone other than his then-girlfriend Lana to receive the funds in case of his death. Reynolds had done the same for the death gratuity of $100,000, which is given to a designated surviving person in the case of a military member's death, according to Wando. ‚ÄúMy intention is not to put pressure on the other person,‚Äù said Wando. ‚ÄúMy intention is to have the will of (Reynolds) be done.‚Äù Another GoFundMe page is also raising money for Lana Reynolds. The page was set up by a family friend and had raised over $12,000 as of April 29. As of April 29, the GoFundMe page set up by Wando had collected $8,000. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that it will even reach the threshold, but at least I will be making a contribution as her father,‚Äù said Wando.

5/3/2022,"Our son has been in daycare since the beginning of the year. If he is sick and needs to come home early, they call me. If they want to give him paracetamol, they call me. If he has injured himself they call me. So what? üßµ1/4 01:41 PM - 02 Mar 2022 I have repeatedly asked them to call my partner first. I have asked them to put a note on my file about that. I have asked the manager. Today they called and I asked them to always call my partner first and 2 hours later THEY CALLED ME AGAIN. What makes this more absurd is.. 2/4 01:41 PM - 02 Mar 2022 ...the fact that my partner has always been the main point of contact! He filled out all of the forms, he did all of the settling-in sessions, and he drops our son off every morning. But they are incapable of viewing him as a primary caregiver. (3/4) 01:41 PM - 02 Mar 2022 When I say gender inequality is a self-reinforcing system, this is what I'm talking about. (4/4) 01:41 PM - 02 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands We list my number as the primary contact for our daughter. The school calls, or daycare calls, or her pediatrics office calls. I answer, and they say ‚ÄúOh, sorry. I thought this was her mother‚Äôs number.‚ÄùAnd I Work At That Pediatrics Office. 02:45 AM - 03 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands So it‚Äôs universal then! And I hate the guilt trips - they ring three times and when I finally ring back they say ‚Äúyour child has been in the office with a migraine for an HOUR, and we couldn‚Äôt get hold of you!‚Äù I hear kid in the background ‚ÄúI told u to call dad!‚Äù üôÑ 11:53 AM - 03 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands I‚Äôm a stay home dad. Primary caregiver to the kids. My wife is a busy corporate executive and they still insist on calling her first. Often she can‚Äôt take the call, so they‚Äôll try her again later rather than call me like they should. It is beyond frustrating and disrespectful. 12:54 AM - 03 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands Thanks for posting this. This has happened to us too. And the converse: My wife sets up all the bank and credit card accounts but when there‚Äôs a problem the bank insists I get on the line and give them permission to talk with her about the account. 07:07 PM - 02 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands Had an appointement for a house to buy. Communication was through me, my partner joined spontanously. The owner just talked to him, waited in every room for him to be there, even though I asked the questions, made clear I'm the buyer. ""She's the one with the money"" didn't help. 06:37 AM - 04 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands I'm single, and always have been. Bought a piece of furniture which was delivered visibly damaged &amp; they wouldn't allow me to reject it until my imaginary husband had inspected it. The world is sexist &amp; I hate it 01:46 AM - 03 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands When one of our sons needed a prescription renewal, I had my hubby call. If I called, I had to leave work and haul them in for an exam. If hubby called, they called in the script to the pharmacy. No questions asked. 12:40 AM - 03 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands This has happened to my wife and to me so many time. I‚Äôd also like to kvetch about the number of times I had to change my son *on the bathroom floor* because only the woman‚Äôs bathroom had a changing table. 03:00 PM - 02 Mar 2022 @RainaBrands I teach Gender in Labor Markets. For mor than a decade I‚Äôve told my students true equality will come when they are equally as likely to call the father as mother when a kid pukes on the floor. Both my kids are Finally off to college. Good luck to you all! 02:55 AM - 03 Mar 2022 ""I research gender inequality in organizations, as well as teach and consult on this topic. We focus a lot on the major inequalities women face in their careers ‚Äî the gender pay gap, the gender leadership gap, overt sexism, etc. But every day, women experience smaller inequalities as well, and these smaller inequalities add up over time. My daycare example is one of them. One phone call isn‚Äôt a big deal. But if every phone call goes to me, it means I am regularly being pulled away from my work to answer a query, arrange alternative care, pick him up, etc. The cumulative effect is an additional mental load and a time cost, not to mention ... the potential to make me look unreliable and not seriously committed to my career. If they never call my partner, not only are we not sharing those costs, but it also means he gets sidelined as a parent,"" she said. ""Gender inequality is self-reinforcing. What I mean by this is that women are expected to be the primary caregivers, so childcare workers (and teachers, doctors, etc.) treat them as the primary point of contact, which means that women end up doing more of the childcare than their partners, which reinforces the idea that women are the primary caregivers.""

5/3/2022,"The oil market is undergoing a serious production problem, warns one analyst, even as prices retreat temporarily amid Covid lockdowns in China. ""From the long term, something far more serious is going on ‚Äî and that is what's going on in Russia,"" Dan Dicker, founder of The Energy Word told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The energy companies, Exxon (XOM), Total (TTE), BP (BP), leaving Russia, stranding assets in Russia. What we've seen is that production in Russia is down more than a million barrels in April alone,"" said Dicker. ""That's going to be a long term systemic problem with production in Russia,"" he added. ""That's a very very big deal for long term prices."" Western nations imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to the invasion of Ukraine in February. Since then, Western companies have largely abandoned investments and operations in Russia. The market has placed a 'de facto ban' on Russian crude, causing prices to go higher. The analyst says Russian oil can be re-routed into China and India at a discount price. But a loss of production puts upward pressure on the entire oil industry. ""When you move it from the west towards the east, you have an issue in terms of prices. The Chinese and the Indians are paying a discount to take what is basically black market oil,"" he added. ""Oil that's lost from the global supply chain because of production problems in Russia, is lost. Period. There is no money to be gained from that,"" he said. ""That, I think is going to be the far more important aspect going forward,"" he added. The analyst says the loss of production will also put pressure on Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, to end the war in Ukraine. ""Russia depends a lot on oil sales in order to drive revenue,"" said Dicker. ""In the end it will be the pressure on the Russian economy that will stop Putin from what he's doing right now,"" he added.

5/3/2022,"A rare video shows Russian soldiers under intense fire from Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. A Russian channel said it decided to share the video to demonstrate its troops' ""heroism."" Warning: The video contains graphic scenes of warfare that may be disturbing. A graphic video shows a Russian infantryman being shot by Ukrainian forces in the besieged port city of Mariupol. The video, posted on Telegram by the Russian channel Military Chronicle, shows close-quarter fighting involving a squad of about ten Russian troops running to take cover in the city's war-ravaged ruins while being targeted with rapid gunfire. One soldier can be seen being hit by a bullet and falling to the ground. Military Chronicle said the bullet hit an artery, and the wound was fatal. ‚ÄîRob Lee (@RALee85) April 29, 2022 One of his fellow soldiers can be seen trying to drag his limp body away as shots continue to ring out. A Russian armored vehicle arrives at the scene at the end of the video, presumably to support the underfire soldiers. ""At first, we did not want to publish this video - it's hard to watch it,"" Military Chronicle wrote on Telegram alongside the video. ""But it was decided, nevertheless, that these shots are also important for the chronicle since the heroism of our guys who are fighting for a dead comrade is important."" No date for the firefight is given. While much footage recorded by drones destroying Russian armor has been published, this clip is one of the first to document frontline infantry battles. The channel claimed that the Russian soldier was shot by the Azov Regiment, a paramilitary force within the Ukrainian National Guard. The group has generated controversy for its ultra-nationalist ideology and has been previously accused by Russia of raping and torturing civilians in the Donbas region. However, the regiment has been hailed for its role in defending Mariupol from invading Russian forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made references to the group to justify its invasion of Ukraine as a so-called ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify Ukraine."" A Twitter user geo-located the video, and posted a comparison image of the undamaged streets before Russian attacks turned much of the site into rubble. ‚Äîerich_auerbach (@zcjbrooker) April 29, 2022 For two months, Russian forces have been heavily and indiscriminately bombarding Mariupol with bombs and missiles. With a peacetime population of 440,000, the port city is of strategic value because of its proximity to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. It has witnessed some of the most bitter fighting of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is estimated that 1,000 civilians, mainly women, and children, alongside 2,000 troops, are trapped underground in the sprawlingAzovstal steel plant, the Ukrainian's last stronghold in the city. Russian forces began carrying out renewed airstrikes on the plant earlier this week and attempted to storm it. President Putin had previously called on remaining Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and said Russia would guarantee them ""their lives and dignified treatment."" Major Serhiy Volyna, the commander of the remaining Ukrainian forces, previously told Insider's Mattathias Schwartz and Michael Fedynsky that the Ukrainian troops wouldn't lay down their arms. ""We're not even considering that possibility,"" Volyna said.
