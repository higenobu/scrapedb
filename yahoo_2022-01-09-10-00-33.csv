1/9/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former model accusing Leon Black of rape asked a U.S. judge on Friday to dismiss the billionaire investor's defamation and racketeering conspiracy lawsuit against her and her law firm, as she pursues a separate lawsuit over the rape claim. In a Manhattan federal court filing, Guzel Ganieva accused the former Apollo Global Management Inc chief executive of trying to drive a ""wedge"" between her and Wigdor LLP by suing, four months after she sued him in a New York state court. Black had accused Ganieva and the law firm of engaging in a ""criminal enterprise"" where they employed an unnamed financing source and public relations representatives to extort him and destroy his reputation. The 70-year-old has also strongly denied Ganieva's claims, including that he tried to arrange a sexual encounter between her and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. In seeking a dismissal of Black's claims, Ganieva and the Wigdor law firm denied conspiring against him. ""Simply put, there are no 'funders' or 'flacks,'"" the law firm said, using a term for PR representatives. Susan Estrich, a lawyer for Black, in an interview on Friday said Black had offered ""incontrovertible evidence"" against Ganieva's claims, and her ""scurrilous claims have no purpose other than to humiliate and embarrass Mr. Black with lies."" Both lawsuits stem from a relationship between Ganieva and the married Black from 2008 to 2014, and which Black has called consensual but ""regrettable."" Ganieva has accused Black of forcing her to sign a nondisclosure agreement, and defaming her by claiming she tried to extort him. Black has said he had paid Ganieva $100,000 a month for 5-1/2 years to keep quiet. Those payments stopped last March. Epstein killed himself in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Black has publicly regretted his ties to Epstein. He stepped down from Apollo last year after an independent review found he had paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning, though was not involved in Epstein's criminal activities. The case is Black v Ganieva et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-08824.

1/9/2022,"With its fingers in the pies of everything from gaming, data center and crypto to auto and the metaverse, Nvidia (NVDA) has seen outstanding success both in real-world performance and from an investing perspective over the past few years. Following conversations with Nvidia’s CFO, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya is confident the chip giant will keep on outperforming. “We continue to believe the company is best positioned to address several of the most important, multi-decade secular growth opportunities with its unique, highly-leverageable accelerated compute platform,” the 5-star analyst said. Let’s have a look, then, at key takeaways from the talks. Contrary to the idea that last year’s gaming growth (up by 60% YoY) was mostly down to ASP upside due to the “preference and mix” to higher priced Ampere SKUs, it was fairly split between units and ASPs. Throughout 2021, gaming demand outpaced supply, and while capacity “remains a bottleneck,” the company is making an extra effort to secure supply. In any case, constraints are expected to abate in the year’s latter half. Arya also notes Nvidia is still “very early in its ray-tracing (RTX) upgrade cycle.” With only roughly 25% of Nvidia gamers having already upgraded, unit and ASP growth should get a further boost from upgrades in 2022. At the same time, the seasonality that usually affects 1H should be limited this year due to “tight supply and broadening of demand from US to China.” 2022 should also see an extension of the “strong” data center momentum in 2H21, with hyperscale customers “scaling” deep learning in AI workloads and continued enterprise recovery and further AI penetration in vertical markets. While the space is increasingly competitive, the company believes its “unique software platform and developer ecosystem provide it with a competitive advantage that competitors cannot easily replicate.” Gaming and data center have been the main breadwinners, but Nvidia is extremely well-positioned to ride other secular trends. The $8 billion auto pipeline should begin to bear fruit in the year’s second half and into 2023, although its impact will mostly be felt from 2024 onwards when the Mercedes software partnership will “ramp.” And of course, there’s the Omniverse - what the company calls the metaverse for engineers – an opportunity both from a hardware and software standpoint. While 2022 will only see minor adoption, over the long-term this can turn into a “multi-billion $ opportunity.” More details on this could get an airing at this spring’s Analyst Day. Overall, Arya rates Nvidia stock a Buy, and has a $375 price objective for the shares. The implication for investors? Upside of 36%. Looking at the consensus breakdown, of the 26 reviews on record, 24 are to Buy and just 2 say Hold, all resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are expected to see 12-month growth ~31%, given the average price target clocks in at $359.17.

1/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- For those concerned that the decade-long super-easy monetary policy has created asset bubbles around the world, the first signs of trouble may be in the making for inflated markets. Most Read from Bloomberg Omicron Study in South Africa Points to End of Acute Pandemic Phase Crypto Diehards Are About to Find Out If It Really Was a Bubble Djokovic December Covid Case Used for Exemption, Lawyers Say Bitcoin ETF Goes From Boom to Bust After a Record U.S. Debut Cyprus Finds Covid-19 Infections That Combine Delta and Omicron To Bank of America strategists including Michael Hartnett, a bubble is “simultaneously popping” in assets including cryptocurrencies, palladium, long-duration technology stocks, and other historically risky areas of the market. The winding down in speculative areas comes as investors brace for the U.S. Federal Reserve to pick up the pace of policy tightening. “The reduction in liquidity from the Fed will cause both the equity risk premium and interest rates to rise, which will continue to disproportionately impact the riskiest assets in the market including momentum-driven investments in money-losing technology stocks, meme stocks, and particularly cryptocurrencies, which have no intrinsic value,” according to Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. Here’s eight charts that show speculation draining out across various asset classes: Ark Investment Management’s flagship Innovation ETF has fallen roughly 46% from its record high in February 2021. The hawkish signal from the Fed has hit expensively valued technology names hard, and many of those, including Tesla Inc. and Roku Inc., dominate Ark’s funds. Speculation is also being drained from other riskier corners of the equity markets. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of unprofitable tech stocks has tumbled after a years-long run-up while an index tracking SPACs is down 35% from its highs. “A potentially rising interest-rate environment is causing investors to re-assess the risk they are willing to take,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF research at CFRA. “Higher growth potential, yet less stable businesses are moving out of favor while investors prioritize more stable ones.” Still, he’s not deeming any of the unwinding of these areas of the market as a bubble pop. “I don’t like the phrase bubble because it is only obvious in hindsight” Rosenbluth added. “We’re in the middle of this trend and it might reverse course or might not.” The Nasdaq Biotech index, which includes companies like Amgen Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc., lost 6.5% in the first week of the new year, its worst five-day stretch since mid-March of 2020. Many members of the gauge have yet to generate sales or profits and have been affected by the investor rotation from high-risk, high-reward stocks. Meanwhile, the Invesco Solar ETF, ticker TAN, saw an outflow of more than $70 million Thursday, the biggest since March of last year. The fund, which in 2020 posted a more than 230% gain, has lost its luster in recent days, as the Fed turns more hawkish. Cryptocurrencies haven’t been spared from the speculative wash-out. Bitcoin had fallen about 40% as of late Friday after hitting a record high of nearly $69,000 in November. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down about 35% from its November highs. The drawdown in Bitcoin “seems to be more driven by short-term traders and investors who regard BTC as a risk asset and tend to liquidate positions to de-risk their portfolios,” according to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading Inc. “Also, leverage in the market is not at excessive levels but had been building, which means that derivative position liquidations help to push the market lower.” The weakness in technology and cryptocurrency is a double whammy for an exchange-traded fund that focuses on both of those industries: the Global X Fintech ETF. The fund- -- which holds both upstart technology firms including Affirm Holdings Inc. and crypto-related companies like Coinbase Global Inc. -- has dropped 30% since hitting a record in October. Meanwhile, the Hang Sang Tech Index is down by roughly 50% from its highs in early 2021 as sweeping corporate regulations and fears of a housing bubble weigh on Chinese technology stocks. Commodities have deflated as well. After a multi-year rise that sent palladium to a record-high in May, the metal has slid about 35%. “What we’ve seen in the past when rates move up either through Fed rate-hike expectations being pulled forward or the 10-year moving up, it seems that tech and some of the growth models get hit more on the valuation side,” Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer and president of First American Trust in Santa Ana, California, said by phone.

1/9/2022,"AI stocks may be excellent long-term investments. The global artificial intelligence market is on track to hit more than $554 billion in total revenue by 2024, according to market researcher IDC. AI, automation and robotics are disrupting virtually every major industry. From machine learning to the ""internet of things,"" autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants and smart home appliances, companies that aren't embracing AI and incorporating it into their business models risk going obsolete. Countless companies stand to benefit from AI, but a handful of companies have business models focused specifically on automation. Here are 10 of the best AI stocks to buy, according to Bank of America. Nvidia Corp. (ticker: NVDA) High-end chipmaker Nvidia is providing the massive processing power advanced AI applications will need. In fact, one of the fastest supercomputers, Leonardo, is powered by Nvidia graphics processing units. Nvidia is even planning to build its own AI supercomputer lab in Cambridge, England. Analyst Vivek Arya says AI adoption is still in the early stages and is just one of many long-term growth trends that will generate value for Nvidia investors. He projects 38% data center revenue growth for Nvidia in 2022. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $375 price target for NVDA stock, which closed at $281.78 on Jan. 6. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and YouTube parent company Alphabet uses AI and automation in virtually every facet of its business, from ad pricing to content promotion to email spam filters. Google is also the parent of autonomous vehicle company Waymo LLC, which made history by launching the first fully driverless commercial taxi service on public roads in 2020. Analyst Justin Post says Alphabet has AI and machine learning advantages across its product range, and AI could help the company further fine-tune its industry-leading online advertising business over time. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $3,210 price target for GOOGL stock, which closed at $2,754.95 on Jan. 6. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Like Alphabet, Amazon has integrated AI into every aspect of its business, including targeted advertising, e-commerce search algorithms and Amazon Web Services. Amazon's Alexa is one of the most popular virtual assistants and is already installed in many American households. Amazon also offers a wide range of AI services to its AWS cloud customers, including advanced text analytics, automated code reviews and chatbots. Post says many market sectors are still in the early stages of cloud migration, which is great news for Amazon investors. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $4,250 price target for AMZN stock, which closed at $3,265.08 on Jan. 6. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) In 2020, Microsoft announced the construction of a new supercomputer hosted in Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing network. The supercomputer was built in collaboration with OpenAI LP to train AI models with the ultimate goal of producing large AI models and related infrastructure for other organizations and developers. In late 2021, Microsoft also debuted Context IQ, an AI application that can predict, seek and suggest information for employees. Analyst Brad Sills says Microsoft's cloud business is accelerating and its margins are expanding, making it a top-tier Big Tech stock pick. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $365 price target for MSFT stock, which closed at $313.88 on Jan. 6. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) For years, IBM has been developing ways to adapt its AI supercomputer Watson to revolutionize health care, finance, law and academia. Unfortunately, genomics and oncology programs powered by Watson didn't live up to expectations. Still, Watson recently performed as well as or even better than AI services from Amazon, Microsoft and Google in tests by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Analyst Wamsi Mohan says IBM's cloud services and AI initiatives will expand the company's market share of total information technology spending in the long term. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $162 price target for IBM stock, which closed at $135.34 on Jan. 6. Meta Platforms Inc. (FB) Facebook parent company Meta Platforms has already applied AI technology to its news feed and advertising algorithms, drawing heat from critics who say the company prioritizes engagement and conflict over user safety and societal stability. Meta is now shifting focus to applying AI technology to developing the metaverse, a digital world in which users interact in an immersive virtual environment. Meta recently touted the speed and adaptability of its new AI moderation system. Post says the metaverse will be a costly but potentially transformational investment for Meta. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $400 price target for FB stock, which closed at $332.46 on Jan. 6. DocuSign Inc. (DOCU) Electronic signature and document automation specialist DocuSign has been investing heavily in AI technology to make contracts and documentation more efficient. Contract AI can help businesses automatically sort through millions of pages of contracts, court cases and regulatory provisions and easily flag potential sources of legal problems, privacy issues, security vulnerabilities or even regulatory breaches. Sills says a disappointing slowdown in billings growth in the third quarter does not change his bullish outlook for DocuSign's long-term growth potential in a $14 billion e-signature market. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $200 price target for DOCU stock, which closed at $143.10 on Jan. 6. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a foundry that produces cutting-edge AI chips designed by Nvidia, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and other semiconductor leaders. TSM also funds its own in-house AI hardware research in specialized areas such as near-memory and in-memory computing, embedded non-volatile memory technologies, 3D integration and error-resilient computing. A semiconductor shortage is supporting margins, and analyst Robin Cheng says the company is perfectly positioned to benefit from a period of high semiconductor industry growth driven by the digital transformation of the global economy. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $147 price target for TSM stock, which closed at $128.47 on Jan. 6. ABB Ltd. (ABB) ABB develops industrial automation technologies that both improve performance and reduce environmental impact. ABB's Industrial AI Accelerator program provides AI tech startups with resources and support in developing industrial AI technology. The company recently invested in startup BrainBox AI Inc., which uses AI to improve the energy efficiency of large buildings. Analyst Alexander Virgo says ABB has a tremendous growth opportunity given its exposure to the electric vehicle battery supply chain, a $19 billion industry growing at a 15% annual rate. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $44.17 price target for ABB stock, which closed at $38.27 on Jan. 6. NICE Ltd. (NICE) NICE is a leading provider of software applications that manage call center operations and customer interactions. NICE's AI and machine learning technology also streamlines fraud detection and regulatory compliance. The company's AI helps businesses categorize and analyze voice communications, leveraging the power of data analytics to improve business interactions with contact center teams. Analyst Tal Liani says digital transformation and cloud platform adoption are meaningful growth drivers for NICE. In the third quarter, cloud bookings grew by 100% and cloud revenue was up 29% from a year ago. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and a $355 price target for NICE stock, which closed at $284.59 on Jan. 6. The 10 best AI stocks: -- Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) -- Alphabet Inc.

1/9/2022,"Underneath the surface, the tech stock heavy Nasdaq Composite is being shredded as traders fret about higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve this year.  Nearly 40% of the stocks on the exchange have been cut in half, according to new research from Sundial Capital Research's Jason Goepfert. The research firm notes this kind of trading action on the Nasdaq (^IXIC) hasn't been seen since at least 1999. ""Bulls will suggest that most of the damage has been done, and the indexes should be able to soar from here. Bears will say this is just like the internet bubble, and the index is about to ""catch down"" to the average stock,"" says Goepfert. Some of the largest tech sell-offs have been seen in momentum favorites among traders. Streaming media player Roku has seen its stock crash 40% in the past three months, according to Yahoo Finance Plus data. Biotech Moderna is down about 30% during that same stretch. The trading action doesn't bode well for the Nasdaq this year, Goepfert's research shows. When at least 35% of stocks are down by half on the Nasdaq, the index has been down by an average of 47%. Top investing minds suggest the sell-off in buzzy tech names shouldn't be a surprise given the changing dynamics of Fed policy and elevated valuations.  ""That's what investors should worry about is the valuation of stocks is also worrisome. In the United States, if you look at the CAPE ratio that is very elevated nearly around 35 times or so. If you look at the rest of the world, it's half of that. So the U.S. has been very, very strong. And we're at the point of kind of extremes where the valuation has been before, but it usually hasn't ended real well. And with the Fed in the reverse gear that they've been in for nearly two years now, that's going to cause headwinds for investors,"" bond king Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an exclusive interview.
