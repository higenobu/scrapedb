3/4/2022,"A fire has broken out at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, after shelling from Russian forces prompted widespread concern about the safety of Ukraine’s atomic infrastructure. Ukrainian authorities later said that the site had been secured and the reactors were safe, and the IAEA said the fire had not affected “essential” equipment. However, the incident underlined the dangers of a nuclear plant in the midst of a conflict. “Europe must wake up now,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video statement. “The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tank that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling.” “If there will be an explosion, it will the end to all of us, the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe,” Zelenskiy said. “Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” A spokesperson for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, said one of the reactor blocks had been struck in the bombardment. In a video posted on social media, Tuz said: “Firefighters can’t access the site and extinguish the fire because of heavy shelling. The first energy unit has already been hit. Stop!” The foreign minister, Dymtry Kuleba, said the Russian army was firing on the plant “from all sides”. “Fire has already broke out,” he tweeted. The state-run atomic energy agency, Energoatom, later confirmed that one reactor block was hit by shelling but it did not appear that was where the fire had broken out, according to experts. Ukrainian emergency services later said the fire had been in a training building outside the plant’s perimeter. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said, shortly before 4am Ukraine time, that it had been informed by the Ukrainian nuclear regulator there was no change in radiation levels at the plant. The agency said its director general, Rafael Grossi, appealed for a ceasefire and warned of “severe danger” if the reactors were hit. Joe Biden called the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at about 3.40am Kyiv time. According to the White House, Zelenskiy updated the US president on the incident and the two leaders urged “Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site”. British prime minister Boris Johnson also spoke to Zelenskiy after news broke about a the fire. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”, adding: “The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further.” “The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. “Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” A live video feed from the plant in the early hours of Friday morning showed a building on fire and smoke blowing across a parking lot. The confinement chambers of a nuclear reactor are built to withstand heavy impact and even bombing, while the VVER pressurised water reactor itself is designed to shut down in an emergency. VVER reactors are considered much safer than the type of reactor that blew up in Chernobyl in 1986, for example. But nuclear safety experts warned that any interruption to the power supply that affects the cooling system could start a chain of events that could lead to disaster, as could a direct hit on the spent fuel pools which are not as well protected as the reactors. “If the building is not damaged and if the reactors entered safe shut down, and have secondary or tertiary cooling systems then there should be little risk. If those conditions are not met, there is a significant risk,” Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the national security council, said on Twitter. The Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine – which houses six of the country’s 15 nuclear reactors – as well as the neighbouring town of Energodar, have been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of the week. Crowds of local people had stood in the road leading up to the plant, forming a human barrier to the invading force. The mayor of Energodar, Dmitry Orlov, said on Friday morning that Russian shelling had caused the fire and posted a video calling on Russian forces to stop the bombardment, saying it could trigger a disaster with effects far beyond Ukraine. Mariana Budjeryn, an Ukrainian expert at the project on managing the atom at Harvard University’s Belfer Center said: “Saying that a reactor building is hit doesn’t tell us much, because the most vulnerable [part of] this is the electricity and water supply.” “If the electricity is taken out, the back-up generators kick in, but if those don’t kick in or their diesel fuel is set on fire, for example, the pumps can’t pump cold water into the reactor and into the spent fuel pools. That’s necessary to keep the nuclear reaction moderated. Otherwise the water will boil out and the core will go critical and explode,” Budjeryn said. She said confinement chambers were designed to withstand some level of impact and could stop the release of radiation even if the core exploded. She warned however that the pools holding spent fuel rods could be more of a worry. “The fuel there is not as active, but they are usually overstuffed,” Budjeryn said. Less active but more tightly packed material was also dangerous if the cooling system fails, she said. “And spent fuel pools are not covered by hardened concrete confinement chambers,” Budjeryn added.",News/World news,Zelenskiy says ‘Europe must wake up’ as Russian shelling sparks fire at Ukraine nuclear power plant,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-fire-zaporizhzhia-russian-shelling
3/4/2022,"Newly released aerial images show the extent of the flooding that has devastated parts of Queensland and New South Wales in the past week. Torrential rain and flood waters have impacted communities along the east coast, from Maryborough in Queensland to Grafton in NSW. Across south-east Queensland, at least 33 areas were inundated by more than 1m of rainfall between 23 and 28 February. In Brisbane 792.8mm fell over the six days to 9am on 28 February, flooding an estimated 15,000 homes across the city. Thousands were told to evacuate as flood waters then surged in the northern rivers district of NSW, laying waste to towns and washing away cattle. The low-lying city of Lismore experienced its worst flooding since modern records began. Striking new high-resolution pictures, taken before and after the flooding by an aerial camera system attached to planes, reveal some of the extensive damage. Images show the suburb of Albion, in Brisbane’s inner north-east, on 24 January and 2 March. The suburb is bounded by Breakfast Creek, a tributary of the Brisbane River. The multi-lane road shown is Sandgate Road, a major thoroughfare. Oxley, in Brisbane’s south-west, was also badly affected by the 2011 flood. These shots show it on 9 February and 2 March.

3/4/2022,"The Karrawirra Parri/Torrens River runs through the heart of Adelaide and, for the opening week of the Adelaide festival, it’s lit up like Christmas — even the nearby Adelaide Oval is bathed in the rainbow colours of pride. Inside the Dunstan Playhouse, Watershed is also built around the water. Behind a simple white stage a tranquil scene is projected, the footage filmed at a spot just a few hundred metres up the river. A lone figure (Mason Kelly) descends from the rafters in slow motion; suspended from a cable with an unbuttoned shirt draped dramatically over his frame, he’s posed like an idol in a renaissance artwork — Saint Sebastian, perhaps, or Christ in Michelangelo’s Pietà. As he floats over the stage, the 18-strong Adelaide Chamber Singers narrate a moment from 50 years ago. “The night’s offerings are of sweat and spit and cum,” they sing with church-like reverence. It’s the scene of a beat, a place where men would meet after sundown without speaking words or exchanging names. As the dancer twirls in the air, the lyrics reveal the beat’s secret rhythms and rituals, its tenderness and grit, in a way that turns this rite of the shamed and marginalised into a kind of sacrament. But the man isn’t flying – he’s drowning. On the night of May 10 1972, Dr George Ian Ogilvie Duncan, a law lecturer at the University of Adelaide, was thrown into the river. The circumstances of his killing, the suspected involvement of police officers and its impact on nation-leading gay rights reform in South Australia are the subject of this newly commissioned work, premiering just shy of the 50th anniversary of Duncan’s death. Watershed is presented as an oratorio; it’s not a fully-staged opera, but the songs are delivered with simple, powerful flourishes by the director, Neil Armfield, and choreographer, Lewis Major – a restraint that suits the sobriety of the occasion. The librettists, Alana Valentine and Christos Tsiolkas, grapple with how to tell his story in song. They resist the temptation to neatly, retroactively cast Duncan as a martyred hero; he was a quiet, private man who may never have identified himself as homosexual nor envisioned himself as a rallying figure for gay rights. There’s also a reckoning with the privilege and status that allowed this professor’s death to needle the conscience of mainstream Adelaide in a way that the uncounted, anonymous victims of earlier gay bashings had not. On this note, Ainsley Melham appears as the “Lost Boy”, a nameless narrator in hoodie, jeans and T-shirt, who walks and sings us through the aftermath of Duncan’s death while posing the question: how many others met a similar fate without making history? Led by State Opera South Australia regulars Pelham Andrews and Mark Oates, who inhabit a variety of historical players including the former South Australian premier Don Dunstan, the Chamber Singers, dressed in the dowdy greys and browns of the era, portray the drowning’s cascading impact across wider Adelaide, as the composer Joe Twist’s score veers into rock opera and disco. Dunstan (Oates) explains in song the grind of parliamentary reform that, even after such an explosive event, is a three-year marathon of setbacks and compromise. This timely echo of today’s parliamentary horse-trading over the rights of queer people isn’t quite as plainly affecting as that inspired opening set piece (how could it be?) but there’s a feeling of bearing witness. A brief moment of jubilation comes in the wake of decriminalisation in 1975; the music picks up to a danceable clip, the Chamber Singers shimmy and a slideshow of grainy photos of colourful parties and beaming friends hint at the liberating effect this legislative breakthrough had for generations of queer people. But still questions of justice remain unanswered, from the New Scotland Yard report tabled in parliament which concluded Duncan’s killing was a “frolic” gone wrong, to the 1988 manslaughter trial that ends in acquittal for the former police officers charged. No one has ever been convicted over Duncan’s killing. But that evergreen note of righteous anger is not the last emotion Watershed leaves us with. We return to a couple sprawled by the riverbank – it’s the drowning man and the Lost Boy in a tender embrace. As they kiss, the Lost Boy reprises his earlier, mournful refrain of “river don’t forget my name”, into something more gentle. It’s now a love song to those unforgettable anonymous encounters – the scent, the stubble, the long kisses. That, for all the danger, the drowning, the injustice, there is beauty in the beat. After the curtain falls and the standing ovation finishes, I walk along the Karrawirra Parri on my way home, passing the spot where Duncan went under at about the same time of night half a century ago. Here there are no flashy lights — but it’s a hard place to forget.

3/4/2022,"Labor has called on the disaster relief agency boss, Shane Stone, to resign over comments appearing to blame people who “want to live among the gum trees” for the cost of recovering from catastrophic floods. The shadow minister for emergency management, Murray Watt, made the call on Friday, as debate rages over the viability of insuring disaster-prone areas and whether the government should expand its $10bn reinsurance scheme to assist victims of floods and bushfires outside northern Australia. Australia’s east coast has been hit by massive storms, causing flooding in south-east Queensland including Brisbane and its surrounds, northern NSW including Lismore and Ballina, and Sydney’s north-west. On Friday Stone, the coordinator general of the National Recovery and Resilience Agency, told the Sydney Morning Herald that “the taxpayer and the ratepayer cannot continue to pick up the bill for these huge, catastrophic damage events”. “You’ve got people who want to live among the gum trees – what do you think is going to happen? Their house falls in the river and they say it’s the government’s fault,” Stone reportedly said. Stone, a former Northern Territory chief minister and Liberal party president, was appointed to the $500,000-per-year role by the Morrison government in 2019. Watt said Stone should be sacked for blaming “flood victims for their hardship”, noting that these included “businesses in main streets of Lismore [and] Ballina” and residents of south-east Queensland. Shane Stone should be sacked today.Scott Morrison’s mate & hand-picked disaster tsar blames flood victims for their hardship, saying they “want to live among the gum trees”. Tell that to businesses in main streets of Lismore/Ballina & residents of SEQ, who are cleaning up today. “I’ve been helping families who are piling up their destroyed belongings on streets. They need our support right now,” Watt said. “They don’t deserve to be kicked by the man who is supposed to be helping them right now.” Stone dismissed the resignation call, telling Sky News that Watt had “been trying to get me sacked for a while”. Stone doubled down on the comments, explaining there was “nothing flippant about [them] at all”. “We’ve got people in the bushfire zone who want to build exactly where they were before.” Stone said although he is currently preoccupied with helping survivors, he had started a conversation about not rebuilding in disaster-prone areas. “I’ve dealt with every major flood that has occurred in Queensland since 2019. “I have experienced first-hand the dreadful aftermath, I’ve sat with people whose lives have been destroyed and we just can’t keep going on like that.” But while Stone suggested planning laws should discourage people from rebuilding in flood-prone areas, Queensland Liberal MP Warren Entsch told Guardian Australia the $10bn reinsurance scheme designed for cyclone-prone north Queensland should be expanded. The veteran MP said he has already made the case internally “on numerous occasions” that the scheme needs to be extended nationally to cover fires and floods. On Friday the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, left the door open to expanding the reinsurance scheme, noting on Sky News that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had found that cyclones cause “the most risk, followed by flood risk”. Asked if the remit needed to expand, Sukkar said: “Given we’ve had such devastating floods two years in a row, there’s no doubt that the funding we are providing will need to find agreement with relevant state governments and local governments to get these projects happening.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, acknowledged that advice from the Bureau of Meteorology and others indicates climate change is contributing to more regular and severe natural disasters. “There’s obviously a lot of change occurring and that’s why we’ve got the policies that we have,” he told 6PR radio. Morrison said governments needed to deal with “the practical issues” including improving resilience through the NRRA. “Climate resilience is something that has to become part of our everyday planning and preparations,” he said, without weighing in on the question of insurance. The Suncorp chief executive, Steve Johnston, has rejected Entsch’s call, despite acknowledging the insurer had supported the reinsurance scheme for northern Queensland. “All [expanding the scheme] would do would be to pass the buck from the private sector to the public sector, from the insurance market to the taxpayer,” he told ABC radio on Friday. Johnston suggested governments should spend more on “mitigation and resilience” to save costs, including the “psychological effect” of repeatedly rebuilding damaged homes. The cyclone reinsurance pool for northern Australia, backed by a $10bn government guarantee, ensures insurers won’t lose money if they offer insurance products in the areas covered. The commonwealth is effectively insuring the insurance companies against any huge losses if they offer disaster cover. The government expects the pool will reduce premiums by more than $1.5bn over 10 years. However, a report by the ACCC recommended direct subsidies as a tool for bringing down premiums rather than the reinsurance pool the Coalition ultimately adopted. The commission in late 2020 found reinsurance pools supported the insurance industry rather than improved affordability. The Insurance Council of Australia backed the ACCC’s findings at the time but now supports the reinsurance pool.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Watt also reiterated criticisms that the Coalition’s $4.8bn emergency response fund has “failed to build a single flood mitigation project” – which the emergency management minister, Bridget McKenzie, has explained is only intended to be accessed when other sources are exhausted. The fund has only spent $50m of its funding so far, which had been directed to flood mitigation. Another $50m for floods is in the process of being allocated, while a third round of $50m was allocated to the Coastal and Estuarine Risk Mitigation Program two weeks ago. Stone noted that spending and said Watt’s criticism was “fake news”, adding there had been no need to access the “fund of last resort” because there was “no shortage of funds – I’ve never had a knockback from the Morrison government”.",News/Australia news,Labor calls on disaster relief boss to resign for criticising flood victims who want ‘to live among the gum trees’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/labor-calls-on-disaster-relief-boss-to-resign-for-criticising-flood-victims-who-want-to-live-among-the-gum-trees
