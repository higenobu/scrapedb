2/13/2022,"Dan Biggar described Wales’s win over Scotland in Cardiff as “one of the best victories I’ve had in a Welsh shirt”. The fly-half, captaining his country in his 100th Test, slotted the game-winning drop goal with 11 minutes left to secure a victory seven days after the embarrassment of the 29-7 defeat in Ireland.  “We didn’t get it right last week and, when you don’t get it right, especially in this country, you get a fair bit of flack for it,” Biggar said. “But for me it was a brilliant day. My family was here, my little boy could come out on the pitch afterwards and it doesn’t get much better than that. Just a really special day.” Wales’s improved performance was built on an impressive display from the back row – Ross Moriarty and the pair of 22-year-olds, Taine Basham and Jac Morgan – as well as an enhanced tight five that contested well in the lineout and set up a rolling-maul try for Tomas Francis. “The boys put in a lot of work during the week,” Wayne Pivac, the coach, said. “That was the Wales team that we know.” Scotland’s wait for a first win in Cardiff since 2002 continues and, after their victory over England last week, they will lament their inability to put in another convincing display. Their captain, Stuart Hogg, told the BBC: “We’re bitterly disappointed. The stuff that we’re in control of, when we’re on the front foot, we’re really dangerous … We’re a lot better than what we showed. “You have to take your opportunities or you get on the wrong end of scorelines. We gave away penalties and Wales cheap field position, easy avenues into the game, and that’s the frustrating part. It’s a horrible feeling right now but that’s Test match rugby.” The decisive score came from a drop goal when Wales had a man advantage and could have gone for a try. “It proved to be the right decision,” Biggar said. “What it enabled us to do in the last 10 minutes was play without the ball. If you’re chasing the game or didn’t quite get what you wanted, then you force something and give up a cheap turnover or a breakdown penalty and all of a sudden you have to chase the game again. So it enabled us to play a territory-based game rather than a possession game, which suited us.” No one would argue with him. Pivac was gushing in his praise for his No 10, who also finished the match nursing an injured right knee. “Dan epitomises what you want in a rugby team,” Pivac said. “That is somebody who is prepared to fight for every last inch.”",Sport/Sport,Dan Biggar: ‘We got a fair bit of flack last week but today was special’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/dan-biggar-we-got-a-fair-bit-of-flack-last-week-but-today-was-really-special
2/13/2022,"It was awfully quiet in the Stade de France around 6.30, the rapt crowd of 80,000 too nervous to sing or scream or shout any more, for a game they thought they had seen their team win once, twice, three times already. Ireland never held the lead, but they never stopped chasing it either. At that point, Joey Carbery had just kicked a penalty to cut three out of France’s six-point lead.  They were trailing 27-24 with five or so minutes left to play and everyone was wondering whether there was one twist left in a match that had been dizzyingly full of them. Then, inevitably, one, two, 20, 30, 40 and who knows how many thousand launched into La Marseillaise. Down on the pitch, Gaël Fickou, launched a chip over the Ireland line, raced through, gathered it in one-handed. France were pouring forward again, into the Irish 22. The move stopped short of the try-line. It was worked wide to Melvyn Jaminet, who cut through on the angle, and over the line, trailing Dan Sheehan after him like he was a scarf in the wind. Jaminet thought he had scored. So did everyone else. But the referee, Angus Gardner, called for the TMO, who ruled the ball had been held up after all. But Ireland had conceded a penalty somewhere in all the chaos. Jaminet kicked it. It had always promised to be one of the great games of the Six Nations. And it was, not least because, way back at the start of the match, it looked like it was going to be a blow-out. The late kick-off meant the smattering of Ireland fans in the ground had the best part of the day to enjoy Paris, it took just over a minute for them to start sobering up. It started going wrong when Jamieson Gibson-Park hoofed a loose box-kick straight into touch, and continued when Ireland were caught flat-footed by a quick lineout. Soon enough, France’s gargantuan prop Uini Atonio had the ball, and was barreling up the middle. It took three men to stop him. That left a gap for Romain Ntamack, who slipped through and flicked the ball back to Antoine Dupont, who raced through to scored. It got worse. Ireland’s attack off the restart was cut short when Caelan Doris fumbled the ball, France gathered it and broke down field, then won a penalty – the first of many – when the Ireland defence was done for holding onto the ball in the tackle. Ireland were 10-0 down before the latecomers had even made it into the ground. It was all looking pretty ugly for them. Then, seconds later, they scored a fine, and startling, try of their own from the restart. Jaminet was hanging back on his heels waiting for the ball while Mack Hansen sprinted full tilt towards him. Hansen leapt, grabbed it out of the air, swerved, landed and raced into the wide-open space behind him. Jaminet was left staring over his shoulder like a man who had just watched the bus he was hailing race by the stop without braking. Carbery’s conversion made it 10-7. After all this madness, the game started to settle down for a stretch, as if both sides were feeling like they needed to take a moment to recover from those hectic first 10 minutes. France began to assert themselves as the half went on. They were that much sharper when they had the ball, and that much more brutal when they didn’t. And while they couldn’t cleave Ireland open again, they were killing them by a thousand cuts instead.Jaminet kicked a second penalty after another offence at the breakdown after another quick lineout, a third after a superb break down the right by Damian Penaud, and a fourth right before half-time, after France had destroyed the Irish scrum. He added a fifth right after the break, for an off-side this time. Which made it 22-7. Jaminet had just about finished banging in the last nail in, when Ireland burst back into life. Josh van der Flier scored one try off a rolling maul after they had kicked a penalty to the corner to set up an attacking line out. And moments later, Gibson-Park got another. This one was off an attacking lineout, too, over the other side of the pitch. But it took some finishing. The ball had moved one phase on, when Gibson-Park spotted a sliver of a gap in front of him as he picked the ball up off the floor. It was more than he needed, and since he scored right under the posts the conversion followed. All of a sudden there was one point in it. It did not stay like that long, either. France flooded down the right wing through Penaud, and then Gabin Villière, who was eventually bundled into touch. Ireland were turned over off the back of the lineout though, and it was Atonio, again, who ended up ploughing through towards the line. They stopped him, but not Cyril Baille, who was following right behind him, and scored. That gave them that six-point lead, and set up those excruciatingly tense final few minutes. In the end, the Irish were beaten, but they were also unbowed.",Sport/Sport,France hold off spirited Ireland fightback to win Six Nations thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/france-ireland-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
2/13/2022,"Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, today sets the stage for a dramatic showdown with the home secretary, Priti Patel, over who should be the next Metropolitan police commissioner as he vows to oppose anyone who does not understand the deep “cultural problems” within the beleaguered force. Writing in today’s Observer, three days after his intervention forced Cressida Dick to abruptly resign, Khan says recent revelations of officers bragging about violence towards women and exchanging racist and Islamophobic messages rekindled personal memories of the “bad old days of the Met” during his own childhood.  Khan says it was common when he was growing up on a south London council estate in the 1970s and 80s to hear “stories of racist, misogynistic and abusive conduct by police officers”. He adds: “One of the things I remember being told as a teenager by my dad was: ‘Don’t make eye contact with the police, don’t give them an excuse.’ My brothers and I would routinely cross the road when we saw officers on the beat, simply due to the fear of being unjustly targeted.” While it is the home secretary, Patel, who has the ultimate power to appoint the next commissioner, she can only do so having taken into account the preference of the mayor. In his article, Khan makes absolutely clear that he will use his right to be involved in the process to ensure the appointment of someone who can guarantee an end to the Met’s toxic culture. In effect, threatening to veto anyone whom he feels cannot rise to the huge challenge, Khan writes: “I will not support the appointment of a new commissioner unless they can clearly demonstrate that they understand the scale of the cultural problems within the Met and the urgency with which they must be addressed. In short, they need to get it, and they need to have a proper and robust plan to deal with it.” His threat is likely to further provoke Patel, who is smarting after claiming that Khan did not inform her he was withdrawing support from Dick, a decision that forced her out. The mayor’s mention of the need to avoid someone who lacks a “robust plan” appears to be a reference to Dick and her proposals to improve the Met, which were handed to Khan less than a week before she resigned. He considered the proposals distinctly underwhelming, both because of the time they would have taken to deliver and because he thought they were insufficient to change the cultural mindset within elements of the force. The appointment of the new commissioner is particularly fraught because the force is presiding over the most politically sensitive investigation it has ever undertaken, into a string of lockdown parties in Downing Street. This weekend, No 10 confirmed that Boris Johnson had received a questionnaire to complete about his knowledge of and involvement in the gatherings. Many Tory MPs believe that if he is found to have broken lockdown rules and is issued with one or more fixed penalty notices it could spell the end of his premiership. Opposition parties, fearing that Johnson might try to use the new commissioner’s appointment to delay or influence the Met’s report, last night stepped up demands that he remove himself entirely from the process. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “The police always need to operate without fear or favour and be seen to do so. That’s why no one who is subject to investigation by the police should be involved in appointing senior officers who have to take charge of those investigations – and that includes the prime minister. No one is above the law. For the sake of trust and transparency, he needs to recuse himself from any role in the appointment process for the Metropolitan police commissioner while the investigation into Downing Street is continuing.” Sir Bob Neill, the Tory chair of the justice select committee, said Patel would need to have “very good reasons” to go against Khan’s choice for the next commissioner. “Politically, this could lead to a massive row. Unless she could produce a good reason to go against the mayor’s recommendation, it could even lead to a legal challenge.” The relationship between Johnson and Patel will be scrutinised in the coming weeks with the home secretary’s political career having relied on his intervention when he kept her in post despite a report accusing her of breaking the ministerial code. Relations between Khan and Patel are already tense with reports of disagreements over the size of Dick’s payoff and simmering tensions over the way the mayor forced London’s first female police commissioner out. Whitehall sources, however, dismiss claims that Patel was blindsided by Khan, saying the home secretary’s officials were fully aware of the mayor’s concerns over Dick and also knew of last Thursday’s meeting which Khan arranged to discuss the commissioner’s future. Sources are bemused at the Home Office’s briefings about Patel not being informed, and point out that it makes her look both “weak” and “out of the loop”. One option being considered is the appointment of an interim commissioner while the search for a permanent chief is launched. Another solution might be to ask Dick to stay on for two months to steer the No 10 party inquiry over the line, a move that would prevent her replacement being contaminated by its findings. Khan’s full support for the next commissioner is critical because of the intimate working relationship between the mayor and the leader of the force in the capital and the fact that Khan oversees the Met’s budget. Meanwhile, Labour has urged Patel to instigate fundamental reform of the police to raise standards before the new chief is appointed. Cooper unveiled five key areas for reform, including the urgent inclusion of violence against women and girls in the Home Office’s strategic policing requirement, and the overhaul of training and misconduct proceedings.",News/UK news,Sadiq Khan pledges to end toxic culture at Met police and signals showdown with Priti Patel,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/12/sadiq-khan-toxic-culture-met-police-showdown-priti-patel
2/13/2022,"A future variant of Covid-19 could be much more dangerous and cause far higher numbers of deaths and cases of serious illness than Omicron, leading UK scientists have warned. As a result, many of them say that caution needs to be taken in lifting the last Covid restrictions in England, as Boris Johnson plans to do next week.  At the same time, demands are growing for Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, the government’s most senior advisers on Covid, to hold a press conference to reveal what evidence there was to back the decision to end all pandemic restrictions. The dangers posed by accepting the widespread assumption that Covid-19 variants would continue to get milder in their impact was highlighted by epidemiologist Prof Mark Woolhouse, of Edinburgh University. “The Omicron variant did not come from the Delta variant. It came from a completely different part of the virus’s family tree. And since we don’t know where in the virus’s family tree a new variant is going to come from, we cannot knoW how pathogenic it might be. It could be less pathogenic but it could, just as easily, be more pathogenic,” he said. This point was backed by virologist Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University. “People seem to think there has been a linear evolution of the virus from Alpha to Beta to Delta to Omicron,” he told the Observer. “But that is simply not the case. The idea that virus variants will continue to get milder is wrong. A new one could turn out to be even more pathogenic than the Delta variant, for example.” David Nabarro, a special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, also highlighted the uncertainty of how future variants might behave: “There will be more variants after Omicron and if they are more transmissible they will dominate. In addition, they may cause different patterns of illness, in other words they may turn out to be more lethal or have more long-term consequences.” Nabarro urged authorities to continue to plan for the possibility that there will be surges in numbers of people who are ill and need hospital care. “It would be prudent to encourage people to protect themselves and others consistently. An approach that does not do this would be a gamble with potentially severe consequences. I cannot see any upsides to such a gamble. The pandemic has a long way to go and – as is the case since it started – people and their leaders will influence its long-term impact through actions they take now.” The warnings came as charities and teachers called for England’s chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser to offer a public explanation of the plan, unveiled in parliament last week, to lift all Covid restrictions – including the requirement to isolate after testing positive – in England from Thursday 24 February. The call comes as new figures suggest that people with blood cancer are now accounting for a higher proportion of Covid deaths than at any point in the pandemic. According to analysis by the Office for National Statistics, a total of 458 people with blood cancer in England and Wales died of Covid between October and December 2021 – one in 20 of those who died of Covid during that time. People with blood cancer have weakened immune systems and so are less likely to be protected by vaccines. “The lack of any joined-up plan to support the immunocompromised suggests that they have not featured prominently in the government’s decision to lift the remaining Covid restrictions,” said Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK. “We understand we cannot keep restrictions for ever, but given the potential negative impact for immunocompromised people, it is important that the government’s advisers set out the scientific basis.” Fiona Loud, policy director of Kidney Care UK, urged the government to show commitment to the nation’s 500,000 immunosuppressed people by sharing their plans, and evidence for their decision-making: “Abandoning all measures without preventive treatments, free testing, and a duty not to expose immunosuppressed people to Covid-19 unnecessarily risks making us into second-class citizens.” Robin Bevan, headteacher of Southend high school for boys, said last week’s announcement felt premature: “It would be much more reassuring – and also be much easier to explain to parents and to pupils – if there was a narrative rooted in science rather than a narrative rooted in libertarian aspiration.” Ceinwen Giles, who has reduced immunity after cancer treatment, said Johnson’s announcement left her feeling excluded. “There seems to be the perception that somehow immunocompromised people are very old and very sick and it doesn’t really matter. If you are old and sick, you still matter. This just means we’re being shut out.” A government spokesperson said: “Those considered clinically extremely vulnerable are advised to follow the same guidance as the general public, but consider taking extra precautions to reduce their chance of catching Covid-19. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves from the virus.”",News/World news,"Next Covid strain could kill many more, warn scientists ahead of England restrictions ending",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/scientists-plead-caution-covid-restrictions-lifted-england
2/13/2022,"We have a longstanding tradition in this country of policing by consent. At the heart of this approach is the recognition that, for policing to be effective, public approval, respect and confidence in the service are paramount. When this trust is eroded, our model of policing, and therefore public safety, is put at risk. This was at the forefront of my mind when I read the shocking Operation Hotton report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which exposed sickening evidence of racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny among officers serving at Charing Cross police station. Nine of these police officers are still serving, with two promoted. Damningly, it concluded that these issues were not isolated or historical.  Reading this report made me extremely angry. It reminded me of the bad old days of the Met from my childhood. Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s on a council estate in south London, it was commonplace to hear stories of racist, misogynistic and abusive conduct by police officers. Trust in the police was at rock bottom in some communities, and one of the things I remember being told as a teenager by my dad was: “Don’t make eye contact with the police, don’t give them an excuse.” My siblings and I would routinely cross the road when we saw officers on the beat simply because of the fear of being unjustly targeted. I’ve seen and felt the damage that this kind of breakdown in trust can cause. It makes it harder to tackle crime, with witnesses discouraged from coming forward when they see criminal activity. It stops many women reporting rape and sexual harassment. And it leads to community groups becoming less likely to work with the police when they are worried about young people getting involved in gangs. During my time as mayor, crime has fallen in the capital. We have managed to buck the national trend, with burglary, gun crime and knife crime involving under-25s all down by about a quarter since 2016. But we still have a long way to go and – if we are to continue making progress – then ensuring communities across London have trust and confidence in the police is going to be critical. This is particularly the case with tackling the senseless knife crime that results in the murder of young Londoners, many just teenagers. Thirty teenagers were killed in the capital last year – every one of them a shocking tragedy. We know the way to reduce this kind of terrible violence is not just through tough enforcement but by the police working in partnership with families, local communities, charities and others to prevent children from being sucked into gangs and violence in the first place. The truth is that communities will only act as the eyes and ears of the police, and be active partners in working to prevent crime, if the necessary trust is established. That’s why I’m deeply concerned by how public trust and confidence in London’s police service has been shattered so badly – not just by the Operation Hotton report but by a succession of serious incidents. These include: the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer; two officers caught sharing pictures of the murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman; and failings by the Met police that contributed to the deaths of the final three victims of Stephen Port, with accusations that homophobia within the police impeded the investigation. It has become crystal-clear that there are deep cultural issues within the Met. It’s my job as mayor to hold the police to account on behalf of Londoners, so it was my duty to act decisively as soon as I concluded that the only way we were going to start seeing the level of change urgently required was with new leadership right at the top of the Met. Londoners need to hear their police service publicly acknowledge the widespread nature of the problem, which is the most important step in starting to rebuild credibility with the public. I’d like to thank Dame Cressida Dick again for her years of dedicated service and her role in helping to reduce crime in London over recent years. I will now work closely with the home secretary as we select a new commissioner. And as we start this important process, I make this commitment to Londoners – I will not support the appointment of a new commissioner unless they can clearly demonstrate that they understand the scale of the cultural problems within the Met and the urgency with which they must be addressed. In short, they need to get it, and they need to have a proper and robust plan to deal with it. I’m optimistic that we can meet the challenges ahead. There are thousands of decent, dedicated and brave police officers in London who are doing an incredible job. I believe in the Met, and I know it contains many brilliant police officers who share my aspirations for policing in London, and who are keen to play their full part in raising standards, adhering to the values Londoners expect and ensuring the bond with the communities they serve is restored and strengthened.",Opinion/Opinion,Sadiq Khan: I recall the bad old days of the Metropolitan police.

2/13/2022,"Australia’s sliding mathematics ranking and disagreements around how the subject should be taught remain key sticking points preventing a consensus on the proposed national curriculum. The nation’s eduction ministers met earlier this month to discuss the proposed curriculum and almost reached a consensus, but while most of the state and territories were happy with the latest revisions, the federal and Western Australian education ministers held out.  “The standards in mathematics and humanities and social sciences – they aren’t there yet,” said the acting minister for education and youth, Stuart Robert, last Friday. “We’d like to see mastery of mathematics for students to understand maths … not just an inquiry approach.” Days later, Robert reiterated that an up-to-standard national curriculum would play a “key part” in arresting Australia’s falling rankings in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The latest PISA results – which assess 15-year-olds’ maths, science and reading skills every three years – were released in 2019. “Twenty years ago we were 11th in the world in mathematics, now we’re 29th,” Roberts said. “There’s only 38 countries in the OECD – so in terms of our performance, we have slipped substantially.” Compared to Australia’s average scores from previous assessments, the country’s PISA performance in maths has been declining since 2003. “You are, on average, 12 months behind now as an Australian student than where you were 20 years ago,” Robert said. “No one can consider that acceptable.” How maths should be taught has been one of the key sticking points of the national curriculum, which is set to be finalised in April, and the first draft of which was released in 2010. Last June, dozens of mathematicians, maths educators and educational psychologists took issue with the issue with revisions to the proposed curriculum. In an open letter to the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, they criticised the draft curriculum as having “little practical value as a guiding structure”, and took issue with “a push toward a central role for ‘problem-solving’ and inquiry-based learning”. “We do not believe that a curriculum document should mandate a specific method of mathematics teaching, and it is especially concerning that the draft curriculum is extensively mandating learning through ‘exploring’ and ‘problem-solving’,” the letter said. When it comes to maths pedagogy, experts disagree on what works best for student outcomes. Opinions are divided into one of two approaches: explicit teaching, in which teachers explicitly introduce and instruct on new concepts, and inquiry-led learning. Inquiry-led learning – which is also referred to as structured inquiry, discovery learning, constructivist learning or problem-based learning – focuses more on students discovering information for themselves, without having it presented directly to them. “With inquiry learning, from the outset, you withhold some information,” says Greg Ashman, who is a deputy principal at Ballarat Clarendon college in Victoria and a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales. Ashman, who played a key role in the open letter, is a proponent of explicit teaching, an approach he says is backed by educational psychology and cognitive science research. In his classroom, he takes a teacher-led, “I do, we do, you do,” approach to introducing new mathematical concepts. “We don’t expect students to be able to do things that they don’t know how to do,” he says. Peter Sullivan, an emeritus professor of STEM education at Monash University, favours structured inquiry. “The mainstream view among mathematics educators is that student-centred structured inquiry helps to develop in students their agency, in terms of thinking for themselves rather than following recipes,” he says. “If, for example, we wanted the students to know how to add 132 to 99, there’s at least four different ways you can do it. The students will choose whichever way suits their knowledge and … where they happen to be in their development. “So why would we say: ‘Here’s the one way in which you should add 99 to 132’,” Sullivan says. “Telling the students what to do isn’t going to be the optimal way to engage them in thinking.” Sullivan cites 2012 research that surveyed students on whether their maths teachers used inquiry-based approaches that PISA termed “cognitive activation” strategies. PISA participants were asked whether their teacher “presents problems for which there is no immediately obvious method of solution”, “asks us to decide on our own procedures for solving complex problems” and “helps us to learn from mistakes we have made”. “The more often that the teacher used those sorts of strategies … the more mathematics the students learned,” Sullivan says. “The results of the 2012 study were so clear that they haven’t bothered asking the questions again. Ashman concedes that cognitive activation is “mildly associated … with some better outcomes”, but points out that so was teacher-directed learning. The 2012 analysis found that across OECD countries, students whose teachers used cognitive-activation strategies and also those who experienced teacher-directed instruction had “particularly high levels of perseverance and openness to problem solving”, and were more likely to favour maths over other subjects. “The more teacher-directed learning, the better the maths outcomes, until you get to very high levels of teacher-direction at which point it becomes a negative,” Ashman says. Some, like educational psychologist John Sweller, who is an emeritus professor at UNSW, have argued that Australia’s falling PISA scores have been “concurrent with an increased emphasis on inquiry learning … and critical thinking in Australian curricula”. “Inquiry learning was conceived six decades ago based on assumptions that flowed from our understanding of human cognition at that time,” Sweller has written. “Subsequently, it became increasingly popular despite very limited empirical evidence for its efficacy.” A November analysis paper from the Centre for Independent Studies found that Australian maths classrooms were much more likely to use an inquiry-led approach compared to PISA high-performers such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Taiwan. The analysis found that “a lack of teacher-led instruction in Australia has contributed to declining student achievement”. “It’s estimated that the average 15-year-old would be about 10 months ahead of where they currently are if they received mostly teacher-led instruction, with only occasional student-led practice,” the report said. “Effective teaching doesn’t employ explicit instruction alone, but a great deal of explicit instruction is often necessary before students have sufficient expertise for constructivist approaches to be introduced.” The director of the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (AMSI) at the University of Melbourne, Prof Timothy Marchant, says both approaches are useful – explicit teaching to build up mastery and fluency of basic concepts, as well as student-centred complex problem solving. “Having a balance there between those two different approaches is important in the classroom,” he says. “I think well-trained teachers can find that right balance.” Marchant cites supply shortages of secondary maths teachers, as well as high rates of “out-of-field” teaching as other potential factors for Australia’s declining PISA performance. It hasn’t been all bad news – results from the 2019 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) found a rise in the performance of Australian students in year 8 mathematics. TIMSS has been conducted every four years since 1995, making it the longest running large-scale international assessment of maths and science. More than 580,000 students from 64 countries – including 14,950 Australian students – took part in the 2019 study, in which Australia ranked seventh in year eight maths and science. There was, however, no improvement in mean scores for year four maths, in which Australia ranked 23rd in the world, with no changes in achievement since 2007. Last year, AMSI expressed “considerable concern” that the draft curriculum’s stronger emphasis on problem solving and inquiry would come “at the expense of mastery and fluency”. The institute welcomes changes in the latest iteration that reverse proposed delays in introducing new concepts – times tables will be introduced in year three, instead of being pushed back to year four and linear equations will remain as a year seven topic instead of year eight. However, Marchant says: “Our position is still that we would still like a fresh start, really, and that the new curriculum be prepared with consultation from all parties in the sector.” “The curriculum should be pedagogically neutral – it shouldn’t force us to use a particular teaching style,” says Ashman. “It should tell us what it is we want the students to know and let us teach us the way we do.” ",News/Australia news,Cracking the formula: how should Australia be teaching maths under the national curriculum?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/13/cracking-the-formula-how-should-australia-be-teaching-maths-under-the-national-curriculum
2/13/2022,"Anna Clark took seven years to write her latest book, Making Australian History, but it seems a wonder it didn’t take her twice as long. During her many years of research, the 43-year-old celebrated author and historian wasn’t at all sure what her opening chapter ought to be. Perhaps that’s not surprising when you consider the almost limitless scope of the ambitious challenge she set herself: to write what is, effectively, a history of Australian history.  A chronological approach common to so much academic and popular history wasn’t going to cut it. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experience – those thousands of generations, those 60-plus millennia (and counting) of human experiences that span time, place and cosmology in a way that challenges non-Indigenous sensibility and intellect – is, of course, omnipresent. But how to explain that in any “traditional” chronological history that aimed to examine what we call “Australian history”, with all its vagaries and ongoing cultural skirmishes, political captivations, blind spots and deliberate omissions? “For example, the term ‘Deep Time’ – history that’s tens of thousands of years old – has only come into use relatively recently,” Clark ponders in her early pages. “Does that mean it goes at the beginning or the end of a history of Australian History?” Clark, whose previous work has won major history awards and who holds an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship at the Australian Centre for Public History at UTS, Sydney, says she “just didn’t know how to do it”. “And then I thought, ‘What if I did chapter 1 as a history of chapter ones which shows how the idea of chapter ones change over time?’” she says. This, in turn, helped her to devise a structure whereby each chapter – among them “Nation”, “Memory”, “Contact”, “Colour”, “Family” (about which, more, shortly) and “Gender” – is propelled by the interrogation of a text or image. So, for example, “Chapter 0, Making histories” contemplates the Dyarubbin (Aboriginal) rock engraving Woman in a crinoline dress, while “Chapter 1, Beginnings” launches off from The History of New Holland, From Its First Discovery in 1616 to the Present Time – published in London in the pre-invasion year, 1787. Chapter 1 begins: “How’s this for a beginning?” Not bad, you’d have to say, given the inherent provocation of The History of New Holland, this country’s first “history”, published before the cataclysmic clash of civilisations that gathered pace with the First Fleet’s arrival a year later. It works. Clark is a wonderful historian, one of her generation’s best. As a writer she is also an admirable stylist. Possessed of a novelist’s eye for detail, her tone is distinctively, laconically, Australian, her elegant prose marked by clarity and an absence of old-school academic pomposity and verbosity. This won’t surprise any who know of Clark’s commitment to democratising what she does in the name of “public history” and of her other work including Private Lives, Public History and her wonderful story of Australian fishing, The Catch. Clark will tell you that she is an obsessive “fisho” and is most comfortable about – or under – the sea. Once she’d nailed the structure of Making Australian History, Clark spent precious, memorable months writing at a secluded south coast New South Wales family property, Ness, near Wapengo. Her family lived there during her long service leave in 2019, then through the Covid lockdown in 2020. “I wrote according to the tides so that I could go fishing. And I thought about place a lot. And particularly, you know, Country. And changing conceptions of Country,” she says. “I was really struck by living in the bush for that long and how much it affected how I thought about the past. You know, walking down to the beach you would be walking through middens every day – so someone had obviously been there thinking about this place and eating from it and even making histories on it for a really long time – several thousand generations. “And it definitely made me think about the timelines and that question that I brought up earlier – you know, when does Australian history begin? And if it begins in deep time, how do we register those histories of Australia from back then?” Making Australian History is replete with that pervasive tension between the stories of the past that early colonial historians – and many of the 20th century – chose to record as having happened on the continent and those they thought a “proud” new nation shouldn’t remind itself of. The violence of Indigenous dispossession – the land grabs, massacres and attempted genocide – and the unsavoury convict experience wouldn’t do. And federation in 1901, she says, did not feel like a relatable human experience. Gallipoli filled the breach. “They [early 20th-century historians] were really looking for an origin story … They had a nation and it clearly had a history but it wasn’t really up to scratch … with the convict legend and frontier violence. Those two profound origin stories weren’t the uplifting national narratives that a proud Australia should have,” Clark says. “It [Anzac] shows that even though that history is confected and highly curated, obviously for it to have that endurance it does hang on many threads of genuine connectedness to many people, as opposed to the federation narrative, for example, which is not really about the people.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Another tension Clark had to wrestle was how her history of Australian history would deal with the work of Manning Clark, this country’s pre-eminent 20th-century historian – and her paternal grandfather. It was not an easy emotional hurdle for Clark who, as an undergraduate Arts student, avoided doing history until a timetable clash made it unavoidable. How did she reckon with the titanic legacy of Manning when she began, finally, studying – and loving – Australian history? “I pretended I wasn’t connected to him. I just sort of didn’t talk about him. Ever. I’ve tried to totally separate my professional life from my family life and he died when I was 12 so to me he really was just my granddad … it was almost like I had just managed to separate it somehow,” she says. “And even when I conceived of this project – and I can’t believe I’m saying this now – I sort of didn’t really think that I would have to mention him, or that if I did, that I would have to mention him in a particular way.” It is a mark of Clark’s modesty – well known to friends and colleagues – that she was concerned detailing her grandfather’s legacy (on her and the nation) might be misinterpreted as “self-indulgent”. Ultimately, she dealt squarely with Manning Clark’s contribution to the nation’s understanding of itself throughout the book – not least in a chapter on family histories. She says, “I don’t have any misgivings about my love for him. You know, I really did love him very much. But in order just to feel like I was making my own mark, I suppose, I didn’t always want to be known as Manning’s granddaughter.” Making Australian History by Anna Clark is out now through Vintage Australia",Arts/Books,‘How’s this for a beginning?’: the tricky work of writing the story of Australian history,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/13/hows-this-for-a-beginning-the-tricky-work-of-writing-the-story-of-australian-history
2/13/2022,"Cathy Beaufort knows she should be touring nursing homes to find an appropriate facility for her 95-year-old mother but “there’s absolutely no way on the planet that I want her to go to aged care”. “How could I put her into care?” Beaufort says from her mother’s home, which she travels an hour to from her Brisbane home multiple times a week to provide care. The 14 hours of care provided by two home care workers is not enough, but is all she is eligible for under a home care package.  Beaufort’s mother is mentally healthy; her heart and lungs are strong. But a catastrophic complication during back surgery means her mobility is extremely limited and worsening, placing her at risk of falls. “I’m 64 [and] I’ve been caring for her for 10 years. Her needs have increased and I am so tired,” Beaufort says. “But even though she is triple-vaccinated, what will it mean for her if she goes into aged care and Covid gets into the home? They might put her in isolation, which means I can’t visit.” Beaufort says she has been reading stories about the atrocious conditions and staff shortages ravaging aged care homes. “I can’t send my mother off to an aged care facility and potentially not even be able to visit her, or leave her there to get Covid.” Georgia Downes, the chief operating officer of Home Instead Australia and New Zealand, says home care demand skyrocketed throughout the pandemic as people were desperate to avoid aged care facilities. “Between the combination of Covid and the aged care royal commission, we’ve seen a 65% increase in inquiries for our services since April 2020,” Downes says. Demand spiked again with Omicron, she says, but staff shortages across the sector combined with international border closures meant meeting the need has been challenging. Unlike the aged care sector, the home care industry does not have access to the national personal protective equipment stockpile or the surge workforce. Home Instead has developed its own education program for carers and is a registered training organisation. It encourages people who are compassionate and caring to apply. “We’ve decided that we’re not going to wait for the government to fund more training for more caregivers.” In Victoria, the CEO of Australian Multicultural Community Services (AMCS), Elizabeth Drozd, wrote to the minister for aged care services, Richard Colbeck, on 20 January to ask what the government’s plan was to support the growing demand for home care. She is yet to receive a reply. AMCS provides home support services to Victorian seniors from diverse backgrounds. “It has been demanding to meet vulnerable clients’ needs without enough employees to provide and facilitate services,” she wrote to the minister. Guardian Australia has contacted Colbeck’s office for comment. Drozd told Guardian Australia that in October the provider lost 15% of its direct care staff due to vaccine mandates, though she encouraged as many as possible to get vaccinated. She also lost staff who were afraid of contracting Covid. “We could employ 50 people today, at least,” Drozd said. “But where are we going to get the people? Migration and students’ intake has reduced in the last two years. “And yet there’s no plan from the commonwealth government, despite the royal commission and Productivity Commission preparing reports saying more workforce shortages in aged care are coming.” Adding to pressures is a rise in inquiries from the community from people wanting to leave aged care facilities for home care, Drozd said. “We have been growing 40% in terms of the number of clients wanting us to assist every year, and it’s absolutely because of the confronting issues from the royal commission and images coming from aged care. I had such a distressed woman call me before Christmas because we did not have the resources to support her mother who was palliative and was set to go into a facility. We just couldn’t do it. “One of the worst days was when we had 73 of our own clients on the 3rd of December who we could not support, we had no capacity. “Because of homes locking down due to Covid, once people go into palliative care in a facility, their family members worry may never see them again in their last days of their lives.” Palliative Care South East in Victoria provides care to people in nursing homes but also in their own homes. CEO of the service, Kelly Rogerson, says in the first three weeks after Christmas, as Omicron spread, she thought: “Oh my goodness, how are we going to survive?” “We had 50% of our staff furloughed on one day, and then to 25% on most days during that first couple of weeks of spread. But everyone from administration to senior management worked so hard to keep everyone supported.” Rogerson says aged care facilities restricting visitors to the elderly in the last days of their life to avoid Covid spread was leading to thousands of people traumatised by a feeling they were unable to give their loved ones a proper goodbye. This was creating unprecedented demand for home care palliative services. In 2018, the service admitted 762 clients, and in 2020 this rose to 1,241 people, much of that driven by home care requests. Beaufort says trying to decide what the best thing to do for her mother is harrowing. She is angry that families have been left to struggle as they try to manage the risks posed to their elderly loved ones by Covid, while trying to ensure appropriate care for them in their final years or days of life. “The politicians have decided to open up before aged care was equipped, and as a result, they’ve shifted the risk onto the most vulnerable,” she said.",News/Australia news,‘I can’t leave her there to get Covid’: home care demand soars amid aged care crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/13/i-cant-leave-her-there-to-get-covid-home-care-demand-soars-amid-aged-care-crisis
2/13/2022,"Although claiming a wild place as your favourite could be a masked attempt to tame it, the land either side of State Highway 67, between Big Ditch and Jones Creek just north of Waimangaroa, is my favourite. This stretch of highway which, if you’re heading north, has a row of houses to your left and a railway and the great Papahaua mountain range to your right, is called Birchfield. There are no off-streets or gas stations. Not a single corner, nor corner store. Just some houses, several paddocks and, as of recently, one radio astronomy observatory. Perhaps it sounds a tame place, and to an extent – on a quick drive through the settlement – that’s fair.  Birchfield is on the land of the Ngāti Waewae people. The settlement is about 120 kilometres north of Mawhera where Ngāti Waewae’s chief Tūhuru and his people established a pā (fortified village) after moving south from Karamea, defeating the Ngāti Wairangi people. Birchfield became an industrial settlement in the 1880s. A recently erected monument in the settlement says a Griffiths family arrived there from Lisvane, Wales. They tore away dense, wild coastal vegetation to set up a sawmill and flaxmill, then, by the late 1890s, a foundry and a butter and cheese factory. About a century later, the sawmill, flaxmill, foundry and factory long buried, my mum and dad moved us (me, my brother and two sisters) to a wooden bungalow in Birchfield. Children lived in almost every second home. Together, we would cross the railway and trek into bush to pick from damp, pillowy beds of cold sphagnum moss, cross paddocks to climb into the huge broadleaf trees slumped over a dark, effervescent swamp, wade barefoot in creeks to search for precious stones, and throw handlines from bridges for herring. I found a dying owl once, fallen from a macrocarpa tree. My mum took a ball of mince and rolled the raw meat in my cat’s snipped fur to trick the owl that we were offering it a mouse. The ruru was dead within 24 hours, not fooled by the faux-fur meatball. I’ve never forgotten how magic it felt to hold the kaitiaki in my hands, and have it look into my eyes. Once, my friends and I were going camping on a nearby farm at the foot of the mountain range. We were only about three kilometres from home when we set our backpacks and sleeping bags in the grass and climbed a big tree. I was up fairly high – as I recall – when I put my foot on a rotten branch and fell. I was knocked out cold, maybe just for a few seconds. I opened my eyes, and my friends were gathered around me. My head was cut. My friends helped me walk home. Dazed and with blood running down my face quick and hot, three kilometres felt a distance. My mum took me to the hospital where someone stitched up my head. Driving home, we passed the farm below the mountains. Sure, I felt kind of cool with the stitches in my head. I hadn’t minded all the fuss over me. But I was now going home to sleep in my plain old clean-sheeted bed, when I’d meant to be sleeping at the foot of the mountains; we had meant to stay up all night watching for stars and scaring the crap out of each other with horror stories. I should have got into a sleeping bag smelling of smoke from the campfire, dirt on my face and knees, under my nails, in my hair. The mountains the only thing watching over us. The scar on my head is faint now. The fascination with the ranges remains glossy, thick, and warm. As I understood it, every beautiful thing came from the mountain range, all the energy and water and promise. They were covered by dense rainforest. Trees in every shade of green and every possible texture. The mountains seemed to not only watch us but stimulate an indescribable hunger to see up close what we could not reach on our small feet: a desire to decipher codes stamped in lichen on trees, collect bones and teeth and line them on shelves, scour the needled forest floors for birds to save or old glass bottles to clean. The maunga (mountain) could not be colonised. Maybe its trees grew too thick and out of reach for milling; their mauri (life force) could not be cast in any foundry. They were the pou (supporting pillar) and the lifeblood of my favourite wild place. Becky Manawatu (Ngāi Tahu) is a former journalist for the Westport News.

2/13/2022,"Shoes, women’s fashion and stationery are just some of the goods Australian shoppers face difficulty finding on shelves as an international shipping crisis sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic shows little sign of abating. While Covid cases are dropping, Australian retailers have warned supply chain issues are expected to continue for up to 18 months.  “This is due to the sheer volume of products and supplies within the global supply chain and the profound shortage of freight space on ships, shipping containers and pallets exacerbated by the limited flights into the country,” the chief executive of the Australian Retail Association, Paul Zahra, said. The continued high price of shipping, together with ongoing uncertainty about when goods ordered from overseas will arrive, has forced Australian importers to order further ahead. That is putting pressure on their businesses at a time when many are already reeling from the direct impact of lockdowns over the past year as well as January’s “shadow lockdown”, caused by people staying home in a bid to avoid the highly contagious Omicron strain. Zahra said retailers were reporting a sevenfold increase in supply chain costs and ordering times from overseas that have doubled or tripled. “The other cash flow impact is retailers having to order and pay much earlier for stock – often as a leap of faith, given the uncertainty in the current market when it comes to customer sentiment and expectations,” he said. ARA members report that they are ending up with either not enough stock or stock arriving at the wrong time – a particular problem in highly seasonal sectors like footwear and frocks, which depend on the weather, and stationery, where sales are given a large bump by the back-to-school rush at the beginning of the year. The organisation has called on the Morrison government for help. In a submission ahead of next month’s federal budget, the ARA urged the government to bring back cash grants for at-risk businesses, reintroduce rent reductions that applied during lockdowns, and give out free rapid antigen tests so that companies can test their employees. Carlos Villazon, the managing director of Stelno Logistics, said transporting a 40ft (12.2m) long shipping container – the most common size – to Australia used to cost between US$1,000 and US$1,500, but over the last year the price had blown out tenfold. He blamed shipping companies for the surge. While price-fixing cartels are illegal in Australia, international shipping companies are allowed to set prices collectively using an exemption that the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, has repeatedly called on the government to repeal. “All these shipping lines are registered to countries such as Panama, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and things like that, so they’re not really regulated,” Villazon said. “So essentially, they’re modern day pirates at the moment because the prices are not really controlled or regulated by any government.” He said Australian importers also suffered because global ship operators consider Australia a “very small piece of the pie”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The amount of vessels they have allocated to Australia is quite minimal compared to other trade links like China to Europe and China to America,” he said. “Think about it logically – why would you assign all your fleet to our trade lane when you can make double the amount of revenue in other trade lanes?” Adding to the bottleneck caused by shipping’s slowdown, Omicron has wreaked havoc in onshore warehousing and distribution. Villazon said up to half the staff in Stelno’s three distribution centres were off work at any one time. “​​The people that we’re seeing ordering ahead – because they’re realising if you’ve got stock, you’re in a really good position … they’re established brands and businesses, we really see them thriving,” he said. However, he said the longer delivery pipeline also meant businesses need “to have positive cash flow to be able to purchase ahead and have larger inventory holdings”. As a result, companies – including his – are turning to invoice financing, a form of borrowing which has been unpopular for about a decade. Also known as factoring, invoice financing involves cashing in orders from your customers at a discount – typically, about 80% of face value – in return for immediate money from a bank or other financial institution. It is the mirror image of the cash flow financing, or “reverse factoring”, offered by Greensill Capital, the once high-flying finance group run by Bundaberg sugar farmer Lex Greensill, which collapsed messily last year. Invoice financing also has risks. Australia’s biggest bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, shut down its invoice financing division after it loaned more than $40m to Viking Group, a trucking company linked to the Comanchero motorbike gang. Viking collapsed in 2011 and two of its executives, Steve Iliopoulos and Vasilis “Bill” Bariamis, together with Bariamis’s wife, Loukia, were sent to jail after being found guilty of fraud against the CBA in 2016. But, lured by the boom in demand, the CBA is now back in the factoring business, and financiers say the use of technology that enables them to keep a close (and automated) eye on their customers’ financial performance has made their systems far less vulnerable to fraud than the largely paper-based system used a decade ago. Daniel Riley, the chief executive of Earlypay, which Stelno uses, said the demand for invoice financing came from businesses who can’t find suppliers. “And when they do, suppliers are changing their credit terms to earlier payment, so there is a cash crunch we have with businesses that would otherwise be growing,” he said. The result has been that clients are borrowing more as sales boom. Riley said sales among Earlypay clients were up 19% in December compared with the previous year. “But just to illustrate the restraint on cash, in December 2020 clients were on average drawing 53% of their total receivables, and in December 2021 that increased to 61%,” he said. “That’s about as high as it can get.” CBA’s head of small business banking, Clare Morgan, said the bank was expanding its invoice finance product, Stream, which it started rolling out last year, as customers grappled with cash flow issues caused by the supply chain crisis. “I heard a lot of customers say to me, you know, I used to develop deep and narrow relationships with my suppliers and I would source inventory and stock on a just-in-time basis,” she said. “But guess what, now I’m diversifying my relationships and I’m making sure that I’ve got lots of suppliers because I don’t know if they’re going to be reliable. “And I’m also moving to a ‘just-in-case’ inventory management system, which means I’m holding more stock, which is tying up my working capital.”",News/Australia news,Australia’s supply chain issues likely to continue despite drop in Covid cases,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/13/australias-supply-chain-issues-likely-to-continue-despite-drop-in-covid-cases
2/13/2022,"It is raining outside the Pitt Street Uniting Church. The sparse city streets in central Sydney have turned greyer in the morning downpour and the sandstone church sits squat between buildings many times its size. Beneath a banner calling for climate change action hanging between its columns, the Rev Josephine Inkpin creaks open the heavy timber door. It is a busy morning for the minister. Morning prayer service has just wrapped up, and in an hour she has a Zoom call with her local MP. Next month will mark a year for her at the church, and she has a lot of plans for it – ministering to communities online and in person, social justice work, climate change action, opening the church up to secular recitals – but her attention has been drawn elsewhere.  Inkpin is the first transgender priest to be inducted into a mainstream church in Australia. And, as she speaks to Guardian Australia in a small, neat office to the side the church entrance, elsewhere in the country politicians and pundits are debating the religious discrimination bill and the point of whether and when religious people and institutions may be able to exclude or ridicule people like her. “The religious discrimination thing has been quite …” she pauses a moment and sighs. “It’s always in the background.” Later, after the proposed legislation was shelved, she will say: “It has been a gruesome week. It’s like you’re in a war, really, and there’s a little ceasefire at the moment, but there’s a promise of a new battle to come.” The religious discrimination bill has loomed large over Inkpin’s rookie year in the church, a year in which she also dealt with the disruption of Covid and death of her parents. Aside from the traditional work of a priest, it has meant, says Inkpin, a lot of extra work. She has been writing submissions, lobbying politicians, forming coalitions, and all the while taking calls from transgender and gay individuals and their families looking for advice, solace and recognition. While she believes there is a gap in the law in recognising religious identity, which is important to address and fix, the bill is “giving people powers to oppress other people, that’s just not right”. She laughs, as though the statement is so obvious it’s absurd. “And it makes our lives more difficult. “It’s damaging, I think, for maybe religion as a whole but certainly for a lot of Christian churches because people start to doubt whether or not places which actually are very gentle and kind aren’t, actually, interested in discrimination.” Much of the general debate around the religious discrimination bill, and amendments to the sex discrimination act, has centred on “statements of belief” – that statements that would otherwise be considered discriminatory are not so when made in line with an honestly held moderate belief – and the rights of religious organisations, specifically schools, to exclude or discriminate against LGBTQ+ staff and students. “The people who are most threatened by this legislation, or aspects of it, are LGBTQ+ children in religious families,” Inkpin says. Those children do not get to choose what schools they go to and what messages are debated in the public domain. If they go to a religious school where their very being is the subject of condemnation, she says, “not only will they be battling their community, but the government will actually be backing these people to make their lives more difficult”. Her laugh has become incredulous. “I can’t get this: why would a secular government support particular people within churches or other bodies and choose sides on something that needs to be worked through in the religious community?” Inkpin says schools need more education about transgender issues and identities, not less, and that transgender staff, too, need protection. “Because I’m a minister and a priest who happens to be transgender, transgender people can identify with me and feel better, even if they don’t come near me or anything – just because I’m visible.” Transgender teachers can offer that to students and others – the sense that another way of being is possible and acceptable. “If you feel like you’re OK, you get on, don’t you? Because I know the shame,” she says. “It’s so destroying.” When Inkpin was growing up in an Anglican family in England, she knew she different. There were nearly no transgender people in her world, and no language to understand what she was feeling. “You knew you loved, when you got the chance, dressing in garments that weren’t supposed to be for you, and a whole lot of other things – a sensibility about life.” But she could see no pathway for herself. Sometimes people are surprised, she says, when she and other gay and transgender religious people say “that the thing that still partly oppresses us actually kept us alive”. Because while the whole world was telling her that she was something she felt she was not, “there’s this space, this reality, called God that says you are loved just as you are”. As she grew older, she studied theology and joined the Anglican church as a priest in 1987. She found it a space where she could exist outside the confines of male behaviour. “There’s a bit more female sensibility, you might say. At the same time it was sort of trapping.” That different role, or space, changed as life became more complex. She fell in love, “and it’s hard to unwind that”. Penny Jones sits with Inkpin in the Pitt Street church office, and they butt into each other’s sentences in furious agreement or to finesse details. Come July, they will have been married for 37 years. Jones had been called to the church also. In England, where they lived, Jones was one of the first women ordained into the Church of England. This too complicated things for Inkpin. The pair have had different iterations as a clergy couple over the years, says Jones; for many of them “Penny was my boss” Inkpin interjects. It was unclear whether, if Inkpin came out, Jones would lose her job. “It became a trap because if I came out then I would lose everything, apart from our relationship.” Some 20 years ago, the pair emigrated from the North Dales to Australia. As they prepared to emigrate, the first transgender priest came out in England. “It was hard to hold it together,” says Inkpin. She would have had more support had they stayed in England. But as they moved to Australia they had to start a new life in a church that is generally more conservative. “So I sort of shut that away, literally pushed those things away.” Shame, she says, “it’s an awful thing to carry around”. Even though she knew that she was loved, believed that she was perfect as she was in the eyes of the god she had dedicated her life to, “there’s still this little lurking doubt that’s been put into your mind.” Shaking off the shame and doubt took time. “I realised I had to let go of what it was. I had to fall into the hands of the living god, as they put it. In doing that I realised it was fine. That was when, as I put it, female energy rose, and I was able to rise with that.” When Inkpin came out in 2017, it was within their “little church” in Brisbane. One woman in the congregation (“just turning 90, I think”, says Jones) was ecstatic. Her grandson and two great-grandsons were gay. “It validated her experience,” says Inkpin. Both Inkpin and Jones continued to serve as priests in Brisbane, but when Inkpin was invited by the Uniting Church to lead Pitt Street, it was the first time a transgender person had been appointed and given a licence to lead as a minister in a mainstream church. Jones had an awareness of Josephine from very early in their relationship. “It’s the old truism: I love the person, not the gender,” she says. Still, she had to embark on a process of self-education. “From my perspective it’s seeing Josephine being able to be herself, most fully and most joyfully. If you love someone, then that gives you joy.” The religious discrimination bill debate arrived on the back of “five, six, seven years” of the trans and broader LGBTQ+ community being called on to defend itself, Inkpin says. That has meant years of writing submissions, forming campaigns and lobbying in defence of their existence as equals. “For things that just seem to be – ought to be – straightforward issues of human rights.” It is as though, having lost the marriage equality issue, she says, some in the religious community “almost want to push us out, out of the way”. All the while, “all sorts of people” have been contacting her as they grappled with their own gender or sexual identity or that of loved ones. “Sometimes it’s lovely, because sometimes they tell you wonderful things they’re doing, and you can encourage them, but it’s this sort of experience that’s below the surface,” Inkpin says. “A lot of that is buried, and that’s quite wearying, really.” “It can be wearying,” says Jones. “But what keeps you going, you know, aside from the call of God, I think is that if who we are, and how we can live out our spirituality, can give encouragement and confidence to a queer person who is struggling, then that makes it all worthwhile. If one life is saved, that makes it worthwhile.” Because those are the stakes, they agree. Young LGBTQ+ people are twice as likely as their peers to contemplate suicide. Jones is confident change will come, that “love will win out”. She remembers when she was made a deaconess in England in the 1980s, she was ordained alongside women who had been wanting to join the clergy for 40 years. “We fear what we don’t understand. It will change.” Says Inkpin: “I think we can deal with this as a society much better, but if people are going to play politics with trans kids’ lives, it’s horrific really and the impact is felt on all sorts of people. We’ve got to deal with the vulnerable first, and I would have thought that’s a basic Christian principle.” Nevertheless, she says: “I see it like a sea change happening. The waves are coming in. You can try to be like the old kingpin who is telling them to go back and you can build a wall, but eventually – you can’t resist it. “Sometimes the wave comes in and goes out again, sometimes it looks as if it’s getting worse, but I think eventually it comes back in again.” However much the religious discrimination bill tries to push back that tide, she says, it will come in again. “In the meantime it hurts people quite a lot, doesn’t it?”",News/Law,"‘It has been a gruesome week’: Australia’s first transgender priest on shame, love and identity",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/12/it-has-been-a-gruesome-week-australias-first-transgender-priest-on-shame-love-and-identity
2/13/2022,"The federal government faces a potential high court challenge to its plans to forcibly send an Afghan Hazara asylum seeker back to Afghanistan, despite the fall of the country to the Taliban and the systematic persecution of the Hazara ethnic minority. Late on Friday, the full bench of the federal court allowed an appeal from the government, which is seeking to remove the man from Australia and return him to Afghanistan. The decision is likely to be appealed to the high court, which may or may not choose to hear it.  The decision made by the Immigration Assessment Authority (IAA) in 2017 that the man, while he faced risk of harm in his home country, could safely be sent back to live in the capital, Kabul, was successfully appealed last year. The man, given the pseudonym EGZ17 before the court, is an ethnic Hazara and a Shia Muslim, and sought protection in Australia claiming he faces harm in Afghanistan. Barrister Jay Williams, appearing for EGZ17, argued the IAA’s decision was now “legally unreasonable” given that when the Taliban seized control of Kabul and the functions of government, the Republic of Afghanistan was replaced by the self-proclaimed Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. He argued that the IAA assessment had been made against a country that no longer exists, and therefore “suffered from an absence of jurisdictional fact and fell into jurisdictional error”. Judge Alexander Street agreed, and the appeal was successful. But the minister for immigration, Alex Hawke, appealed to the full bench of the court, arguing the initial decision by the IAA should be upheld, regardless of the changed circumstances in Afghanistan and the illegality of the Taliban coup. Lawyers for the government argued “a change in governance of a country, even if secured through activity which does not conform to the laws of the country, does not inexorably lead to a conclusion that the country has ceased to exist”. Late on Friday, the government’s appeal was allowed by the full bench of the federal court. The federal court heard EGZ17 “faces a real risk of serious and significant harm … including death, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at the hands of the Taliban and other extremist groups on the basis of his religion, ethnicity, political opinion and membership of a social group, as a Hazara, a Shia Muslim and as a returnee asylum seeker from Australia”. Australia has previously forcibly removed a number of Hazara Afghans prior to the fall of Kabul, including some who faced serious hostilities, with one reportedly kidnapped and tortured by the Taliban before escaping. But this is the first time the government has indicated it would remove a Hazara since the fall of Kabul. The Guardian understands the man’s removal is not imminent, but the government is keen to press its right to send Afghans back to the country if, in its judgment, the security situation has improved. Immediately after the fall of the Kabul, the immigration minister said “no Afghan visa holder currently in Australia will be asked to return to Afghanistan while the security situation there remains dire”. But that moratorium is only temporary, and it does not apply to Afghans in Australia who do not hold a visa. The Guardian is aware of dozens of Afghan nationals whose place in Australia remains uncertain, making EGZ17’s case a critical test. The Taliban has a history of violently repressing the Hazara ethnic minority, with that danger exacerbated by the fall of Kabul and their rise to power. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade outlined the dangers the Hazara ethnic minority face in its Thematic Report on the Political and Security Developments in Afghanistan, released in January. “Dfat assesses that Hazaras in Afghanistan face a high risk of harassment and violence from both the Taliban and [terrorist group the] Islamic State in Khorasan Province, on the basis of their ethnicity and sectarian affiliation,” the report said. After the fall of Kabul, the Action for Afghanistan advocacy group published an open letter urging the government, among other actions, to “grant amnesty to all nationals of Afghanistan currently in Australia who fear returning to Afghanistan”. The return of Taliban rule had “instilled fear and insecurity”, the group said. “Afghanistan’s historically persecuted Hazara ethnic group, who faced widespread killings and genocide the last time the Taliban were in power, are now more acutely at risk. The Hazara community has never known safety while the Taliban have reigned.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Afghan-Australian Arif Hussein, a senior lawyer at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, told the Guardian he believed it was “unconscionable for the Australian government to return people to Afghanistan, especially the long-persecuted Hazara”. “In recent months, one million people have fled Afghanistan, fleeing insecurity, famine and Taliban violence specifically targeting ethnic minorities,” Hussein said. “The UN has described it as the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. It is not safe in Afghanistan for anybody, but it is especially not safe for Hazaras.” Hussein said Australia had a moral obligation to the people of Afghanistan, after its long-running involvement in the war there and withdrawal last year. A Senate inquiry has described Australia’s withdrawal as “dishonourable”, saying the country had left Afghan allies “standing in harm’s way”. Australia has committed 15,000 places within its existing humanitarian intake for Afghan nationals over the next four years, but no additional places. “Australia can do more to bring people to safety from Afghanistan, to grant permanent visas to Afghans who are living in Australia on temporary visas, and, at the very least, not return anybody or attempt to return anybody to Afghanistan,” Hussein said. “It’s unconscionable to send people back.”",News/Australia news,Government plans to send Hazara asylum seeker back to Afghanistan may face high court challenge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/13/government-plans-to-send-hazara-asylum-seeker-back-to-afghanistan-may-face-high-court-challenge
2/13/2022,"This is a government that lies. It lies because it is led by a prime minister who long ago forgot the difference between truth and falsehood, assuming he ever knew it to begin with. It lies because the prime minister has always said whatever he needs to say to get a laugh, a vote, a cheque or a reprieve. It lies because the prime minister found that lying was easy – when he lost one job on the Times for lying he got a new job on the Telegraph, where he lied some more. This is a government that lies. It lies because lying never harmed its leader’s political career and, when he was fired from a shadow junior ministerial position for lying on a small scale in 2004, he went on to win the Brexit referendum in 2016 by lying on a grand scale and then became prime minister in 2019 to lie on an epic scale.  This is a government that lies. It lies because it is a lame-duck administration of charlatans and clowns, an echoing void where the government of the country ought to be. It lies to make it from one scandal to the next, from the scandal about wallpaper to the scandal about lobbying to the scandal about the partying to the scandal about Jimmy Savile to the scandal that will break this week and every week after that. This is a government that lies. It lies because none of the stories it tells itself make sense. It lies because Brexit has not made Britain great again, but brought nothing but trade barriers and clinging bureaucracy. It lies because austerity was a blunder and levelling up will be a chimera. It lies because it says it is the party of tax cutters but is raising taxes, and says it is the party of sound money but is allowing inflation to soar, and says it is the party of home ownership but is letting landlordism rip, and says it is the party of enterprise but is crushing productivity. It lies because it is easier to lie than accept the truth that its hopes have turned to ashes. This is a government that lies. It lies because it knows it can never admit that the prime minister, his wife, aides and civil servants giggled and guzzled as millions suffered isolation and loss. It lies because it did not listen when the prime minister’s own adviser warned that attacking the leader of the opposition with lies about “a horrendous case of child sex abuse” would be seen as the scurrilous act of a scoundrel leader. This is a government that lies. It lies because it knows liars can game a quaint system whose rules mandate that the Speaker of the House of Commons will allow a liar to lie but will expel MPs who point out that the liar is indeed lying. It lies because broadcasters place balance above truth and if one guest says the world is round, they must rush to find another who will say it is flat. It lies because the prime minister is the creation of the Tory press and its editors can no more bear to tell the truth about him than Caliban could bear the sight of his face in the mirror. It lies because thoughtful people think twice before condemning a liar for lying and provide cover for the prime minister whenever they wonder if he is just confused, or ill-informed or so lost in delusion he believes his lies as he tells them – as the best liars always do. It lies because respectable society fears that throwing accusations of lying around will create a vicious, foul-mouthed country – without realising that they already live in the future they fear. This is a government that lies. It lies because it knows that most people pay next to no attention to politics and will let it get away with lying. It lies because it knows many people think “all politicians are liars” and expect to be lied to. It lies because too few have learned the difference between politicians who stonewall, twist, brag and fall into groupthink and the Putin and Trump wannabes, who think that if leaders destroy trust in everyone and everything voters may stop believing that change for the better is possible and stick with the liars they know. It lies because it is gambling that a society where trust has evaporated will be easier to govern than a confident country that insists on high standards. This is a government that lies. It lies because, despite all it says to the contrary, it quietly despises Conservative voters and thinks they are either such fools that they believe their leaders’ lies or such cynics that they admire the rat-like cunning their leaders display when they lay their false trails. It lies because a generation of amoral commentators assured it that the truth no longer mattered as the electorate had “baked in” the prime minister’s willingness to lie. This is a government that lies. It lies because it instinctively understands what sociologists call “strategic lying” and the rest of us call “shit sticking”, shifts the news agenda on to its preferred territory. It lies because it knows Dominic Cummings was right to agree that when he told the lie that Brexit would deliver £350m a week to the NHS in 2016, or the prime minister told the lie this year that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile, they “trapped” their opponents into spreading the lies as they refuted them. It lies because it cannot admit the existence of the world in front of its eyes. It ignored a fraud epidemic last week, so it could pretend that crime is falling. It went on to ignore the sharpest collapse in living standards in 30 years so it could pretend the economy was booming. It lied last week as it lies every week. It lies to the Queen. It lies to parliament. It lies to the electorate. It lies to itself. It lies as a matter of policy. It lies as a matter of course. It lies when it doesn’t need to lie. It lies because it doesn’t know what else to do. It lies because it is all it can do. This is a government that lies.

2/13/2022,"The Great Barrier Reef – the world’s largest coral reef system, covering an area about the size of Germany – always comes with big numbers. Last month the Australian government pledged another seemingly large figure, $1bn, for conservation and science to be spent over the next nine years and spread along the 2,300km reef.  That comes on top of state and federal government commitments in the region of $3bn since 2014. So where is all the money going, and will it be enough to keep one of the world’s most complex natural wonders from collapsing under the mounting pressure of global heating? Without rapid global cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, many experts fear the $1bn will do little except delay the inevitable. More urgent for the Morrison government is whether the funding – contingent on the Coalition winning the next election – will convince the 21-country world heritage committee not to dump the reef onto its list of sites in danger when it meets in July. The $1bn pledge came just days before a 1 February deadline to deliver a report to the world heritage centre in Paris outlining the health of the reef and what was being done to build its resilience. An economic analysis of the value of the reef – released in 2017 but still referred to by the government – said the reef added $6.4bn to the nation’s economy in just one year, mostly through tourism, commercial fishing, recreation and scientific research. Some $579.9m of the $1bn pledge would go to water quality projects, with the next largest slice – $252.9m – for reef management and conservation. Another $92.7m is for research and adaptation and $74.4m would go to community- and traditional-owner led projects, such as habitat restoration and species protection. The reef’s major threat is from climate change – specifically, rising ocean temperatures that have caused corals to bleach en masse five times since the first recognised outbreak in 1998. Unesco’s science advisers want management plans to account for the effects of climate change, to have greenhouse gas emissions targets consistent with 1.5C of global warming (analysts say Australia’s approach is aligned with heating closer to 3C) and to do more to cut pollution running into the reef from the land. Sediments, nutrients and pesticides running into the marine park can harm inshore corals, as well as marine habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves. One key source for these pollutants is agriculture, both directly when on-farm pollutants get washed into waterways and indirectly when exposed soils and eroded riverbanks are washed away by rain. According to the Queensland government, in the five years from 2017 to 2022, commitments focused on improving water quality stood at $270m from the state government and $396m from the commonwealth. A spokesman for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said under the $1bn plan, funding for water quality would rise from $60m a year now to $85m a year from 2026-27 through to the end of the decade. The state and federal governments have set targets for water quality up to 2025, and release an annual report card. The most recent results with data up to 2019 show slow progress from previous years, even though three of the four key measures indicate the target is at least halfway to being met. “Overall inshore marine condition remained poor in 2018-2019, with coral and seagrass in poor condition and water quality rated moderate,” the report said. A spokesman for Ley said: “We are confident that the additional programs generated through this funding will significantly accelerate these outcomes.” Queensland’s minister for the Great Barrier Reef, Meaghan Scanlon, says the $270m in recent years does not include a $2bn renewable energy fund, or $500m for land restoration. “Since 2015, we’ve banned the dumping of dredge spoil, passed tree clearing laws, committed to bring in reef regulations, brought in net free zones and invested billions of dollars to help protect the Great Barrier Reef,” Scanlon says. Funding for direct interventions to improve water quality is spread across multiple projects. Between 2018 and 2023 some $200m of federal cash is routed through the Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF) – a small not-for-profit that was given a $443m grant by the Turnbull government in 2018, to be spent over six years. Theresa Fyffe, executive director of projects and partnerships at the foundation, said the bulk of the money had gone to 10 regional programs. Fyffe said the foundation is working with more than 1,000 farmers across 15,000 sq km. There are two approaches, she said. One is to improve the way farmers use fertilisers and pesticides so that less washes away during rain. Field officers work with farmers to map out their land and soil types and document how they use fertilisers and chemicals before drawing up management and monitoring plans. The other identifies projects such as earthworks that will directly tackle problems such as erosion of creek-banks or damage to wetlands. “You’re trying to drive enduring change,” she said. “Working with a grower for five years gives you a change that is there forever. That’s when farmers can become advocates.” The grant to the foundation remains controversial. Labor said last month it would terminate the agreement and reallocate any unspent funds if it won the next election. But there is unlikely to be much uncommitted cash left. The foundation’s managing director, Anna Marsden, said by the end of this financial year, only $80m will be uncommitted and “every dollar is allocated for a program” with much of the uncommitted funds earmarked for traditional owner-led projects. “We’re halfway through a job. And it’s a big job,” Marsden said. “The reef is an extreme sport because there’s opposing views all over the place and everyone is passionate. “But we can’t give up on the reef. The reef won’t give up and the public aren’t giving up and neither are the scientists. But this is the critical decade. It’s crunch time.” In a landmark 2012 scientific paper, scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science found coral cover over the reef had dropped by half between 1985 and 2012. About 42% of that loss was down to the voracious coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (Cots). “They are just so exquisitely evolved to take advantage of the conditions and they can get to plague proportions,” said Dr Roger Beeden, responsible for co-ordinating the Cots control program and director of reef interventions at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Beedon said Cots are part of the reef’s ecosystem, but they have become a pest that are able to eat their own bodyweight in coral in a matter of days. “They can cause very rapid decline in coral cover. There can be carpets of them.” The bulk of the funding for the Cots program goes to running five dedicated boats with teams of up to eight divers that select locations based on new methods of modelling outbreaks. Beeden says since the 2018 funding expanded the program, 268 reefs have been actively managed and 320,000 starfish have been killed in 43,000 diver-hours. Divers use spear-like injection guns to pump the starfish – which can grow to the size of a dinner plate – with either ox bile or household vinegar. A new “one shot” method has replaced an older approach that used acid salt that needed to be injected into every arm of the starfish (miss one arm, and the starfish could survive). Beeden said many tourism operators like to carry out their own culling operations as they visit reefs “so we provide them the materials to do that”. The aim for the dive teams, Beeden said, is not to eradicate the starfish, but to get them down to sustainable levels. Divers have become highly skilled, he said, and can spot juvenile starfish the size of a thumbnail. The reef is in the middle of the fourth major outbreak of the starfish since the first in the 1960s. Through the grant to the GBRF, $57m went to controlling Cots, and Beeden said about $41m was spent on the direct control program. Under the latest federal government funding pledge, Beeden said $162m is identified for Cots control. “Every adult coral we keep alive matters,” he said. Some $100m of the GBRF’s grant has gone to research and development projects, adding to funding of reef-related research at other institutions including CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science. These R&D projects include the development of more heat-tolerant corals, methods to help the dispersal of coral larvae and more controversial approaches such as brightening clouds to shade corals undergoing heat stress. A study released last year suggested if these mostly unproven methods could be deployed at scale, they could slow down the loss of corals by as much as two decades. But scientists agree that any benefits the reef could gain from improving water quality or making corals more resilient will be swamped by rising ocean heat – an inevitable consequence of increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Two academic experts on reef management and science said the $1bn funding was “nonsensical” because it failed to address the direct cause of the majority of the reef’s problems. “Unless we deal with climate change, everything else is just shuffling the deckchairs,” says Prof Terry Hughes, a prominent coral and reef scientist at James Cook University. “Even if we had pristine water quality and we could find a magical bullet to control crown of thorns, we still have the overwhelming problem of global warming. “These other Band-Aids will only make a difference if we deal with climate change. They’re all contingent on water temperatures being tolerable for corals.”",News/Environment,Australia is spending billions on the Great Barrier Reef.

2/13/2022,"Like almost every other institution in this country, Australian sport has been captured by carbon; succumbing to the interests of multinational corporations at the centre of the climate crises. Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting completed the coup by announcing a multi-year sponsorship deal with the Australian Olympic Committee.  It’s quite spectacular for the AOC, a United Nations’ Sports for Climate Action Framework signatory and Reconciliation Action Plan holder, to partner with an industry whose material wealth appears both founded and reliant on the destruction of First Nations communities and cultures. It’s even more galling considering Rinehart is the benefactor of her father, Lang Hancock, who famously proposed “herding Aboriginal people into one area before doping up the water so they were sterile and eventually breed themselves out”. Of course, none of this matters to institutions whose sustainability and reconciliation action plans are created to be wielded as nothing more than a marketing tool; the default position for corporate Australia. But there was a sliver of light in Australian sport when Tennis Australia confirmed the axing of Santos from the 2021 Australian Open sponsors list. Although the AFL dropped Rio Tinto in 2020 for destroying the 46,000-year-old Juukan caves, this is the first time that a peak sporting body has presumably dumped a partner on the specific grounds of climate – clearing the path for others to follow suit; and herein lies the opportunity for the first follower. The power of the first follower is notoriously understated. An unsung hero that is routinely overlooked, the first follower exhibits arguably more courage than the leader whose initial step took the tally from zero to one. It’s the first follower who normalises and validates the actions of those they are following, providing safe passage for the fence sitters whose strength depends on the quantity of those around them and the direction they are moving. Without the forward momentum that the first follower brings, moments don’t evolve into movements; and that’s the tantalising opportunity that Tennis Australia has provided for athletes, fans and administrators. By rectifying their initial failure and parting ways with Santos, Tennis Australia is the flint and the first follower – whether that be the Australian Olympic Committee, AFL, Cricket Australia, Netball Australia, Swimming Australia, Rugby Australia or the plethora of clubs under their codes banners that have been captured by carbon – to be the spark. In a transitional and overlapping phase of the sporting calendar, it’s an opportune moment for athletes to reject the generations of Australian pacifism that has enabled the governing bodies to commodify them. It’s a chance to pull back the curtains and dismantle the stage that has seen athletes blindly championing the vested interests of corporations and wealthy individuals like mannequins in a shop window. The recent Cool Down campaign, led by Emma and David Pocock from FrontRunners, has signalled that athletes are starting to rise from their slumber. The campaign acknowledges the threat that climate change poses to the future of sport and impressively garnered signatures from more than 300 athletes, calling upon governments to be more ambitious with their climate commitments. But the legitimacy, agency and integrity of these pledges will be undermined for as long as the athletes and their employers champion the causes of companies such as Santos, Hancock Prospecting, BHP, Woodside, Origin Energy and the like. As much as the general public want to rally behind athletes such as Pat Cummins, a signatory of the Cool Down campaign, it’s hard to unsee the fact that he and his peers have spent another summer promoting Alinta Energy; a convenient yarn that almost makes you forget that they pump around 11.7M tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere per year. Tennis Australia has begun squiggling “the line” that major institutions are so afraid to draw. In doing so, they have begun laying down safeguards for the sports future, setting a precedent for others to follow and excitingly exposed themselves to a whole new market of potential investors. Now we await with anticipation to see who, if anyone, will courageously be the first to follow.
