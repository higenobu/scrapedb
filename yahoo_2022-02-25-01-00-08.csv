2/25/2022,"China appeared to be less than thrilled with the aggressive military actions taken in Ukraine on Thursday by President Xi Jinping's self-described ""best friend,"" Vladimir Putin. At a briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying expressed that ""China did not wish to see what happened in Ukraine today,"" and deflected allegations that Beijing was providing backing for the attack, The Washington Post reports. ""As for American hints that Russia had China backing it up, I'm sure Russia would be pleased to hear it,"" Hua said. ""We won't be like America and provide Ukraine a large amount of military equipment. Russia as a powerful nation also does not need China or other countries to provide [military assistance]."" China remains in an unenviable position of trying to balance calls for restraint and calm with its friendly relations with Moscow. The nation's proxies attempted again on Thursday to express both acknowledgment of Ukraine's territorial integrity as well as Russia's ""reasonable security concerns,"" the Post adds. China has also blamed the U.S. for the deterioration of relations. ​​""A key question here is what role the U.S., the culprit of current tensions surrounding Ukraine, has played,"" Hua said on Wednesday. ""If someone keeps pouring oil on the flame while accusing others of not doing their best to put out the fire, such kind of behavior is clearly irresponsible and immoral."" As Samuel Goldman writes for The Week, though, China's discomfort with Russia's aggression could drive a wedge between the two friendly nations. ""In particular, the [Biden] administration may hope to make China squeamish about providing further support to a disruptive actor,"" he writes. ""Despite friendly joint statements issued on the opening day of the Winter Olympics, there are hints that the Chinese authorities worry Russia will go too far in provoking the United States and European Union.""

2/25/2022,"Warning: This video contains graphic language Words by Emily Lefroy An Australian photojournalist has captured the moment a missile flew over his head in Kramatorsk, Ukraine during a livestream. ""Oh f**k that's a missile, that's a f**king missile,"" photojournalist and documentary maker Bryce Wilson says in the video, panning to the object flying through the sky. ""Holy s**t. We better get inside"". Mr Wilson, from Melbourne, had been livestreaming to Instagram in the moments after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. ""There's [cruise] missiles flying above the f**king city right now,"" he said while running. ""There's been an impact in the distance."" ""Holy f**king s**t,"" he says again, as faint explosions can be heard in the background saying he can see fighter jets and smoke. ""The Russian military is bombing Kramatorsk."" He also showed a mushroom cloud that had developed after the explosion in the direction the missile had been travelling. Warning: This video contains graphic language The journalist filmed himself talking as he walked along the street with a colleague, occasionally panning to show his surroundings showing a largely bare street and occasionally exchanging passing pleasantries with Ukrainian people. ""Kramatorsk is being attacked,"" he tweeted. In a follow-up livestream on Instagram, Mr Wilson filmed himself wearing armour and walking through Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine heading towards a bomb shelter with some fellow journalists. Mr Wilson says he is in Ukraine voluntarily and has been working in and out of the country for several years. ""I can't believe this is happening,"" he said in disbelief. Mr Wilson said in the livestream he would try and make it back to Kyiv. ""People legitimately don't think this is happening,"" he said, panning across the eerily quiet street. ""This country is being attacked"". The UK and Western allies have condemned Putin after the Russian President ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and called on it to ""lay down"" its arms. Boris Johnson – whose initial package of sanctions was criticised by senior Tories and opposition figures – has promised to respond “decisively” to the Russian onslaught. “I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelensky to discuss next steps,” he said. “President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. “The UK and our allies will respond decisively."" Putin announced the action during a televised address early on Thursday morning, saying the move was a response to threats from Ukraine. He said Russia does not have a goal to occupy Ukraine, but the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian “regime”. Russia’s military said it has targeted Ukrainian air bases and other military assets and has not targeted populated areas.",News/Yahoo News UK,Ukraine war: Filmmaker livestreams moment missile flies over his head,https://news.yahoo.com/aussie-livestreams-moment-missile-flies-over-his-head-in-ukraine-083426735-100245049.html

2/25/2022,"Putin's attire during his war declaration suggests his speech may have been pre-taped. Both a Monday and a Thursday video show the Russian president wearing the same attire. The videos show Putin seemingly wearing a black blazer with a white dress shirt and a maroon tie. Russian President Vladimir Putin's attire during his Thursday war declaration suggests his speech may have been pre-taped. Putin on Thursday said he decided to launch a ""special military action"" against Ukraine, in a video that aired early Thursday morning in Russia. But during a televised address on Monday, Putin appeared to wear the same outfit as he denounced Ukraine's sovereignty, argued that Ukraine was a creation of the Soviet Union, and announced military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Both videos were filmed with Putin apparently sitting in the same spot, at the same table, wearing the same outfit: A black blazer with a white dress shirt and a maroon tie. The similar attire and location prompted speculation that the declaration of a military assault against Ukraine was taped earlier. Some analysts thought they found proof the address was pre-taped, citing metadata from an official video. However, Aric Toler, an analyst with the publication Bellingcat, said this was based on data from a different video, and that the Kremlin video's data showed a creation date of February 24, leaving it unclear when the video was filmed. Other elements of Russia's actions on Ukraine have been scrutinized for apparent discrepancies in their timings. Documents from separatist leaders in Luhansk and Donetsk requesting aid from Russia, made public on February 23, bore signatures from the day before. The Kremlin also admitted that a dramatic Security Council meeting in Moscow on Februayr 23, on deciding whether to recognise the separatist regions as independent states, had been recorded a full five hours before it was broadcast. Meanwhile, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, delivered a searing response to Putin's action at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council late on Wednesday night. ""About 48 minutes ago, your president declared war on Ukraine,"" Kyslytsya said to Russia's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzya. Hours after Putin's declaration on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said that the country was being targeted by airstrikes.
