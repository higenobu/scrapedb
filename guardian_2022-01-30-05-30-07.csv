1/30/2022,"Outside, Cameroon’s supporters were left under no illusions about what was expected of them. Inside, those who fulfilled the conditions for smooth passage could raise the roof. This Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final, won with two goals from Karl Toko Ekambi, was always going to be loaded with added meaning but the host nation progressed on two fronts. There was no repeat of Monday’s tragedy at the Stade Olembé in Yaoundé which has scarred this tournament irreversibly and nor was there any real sense one might occur; there was also a distinct impression Cameroon are equipped to go all the way, brushing aside a spirited representation from the Gambia who have formed some of the past fortnight’s fonder memories and would be welcomed to this level again.  “Condolences to families of the departed spectators,” read a message on the big screens at either end during a well-observed, if brief, period of silence before kick-off. The balance required of the competition’s organisers was one that honoured the eight who died in the crush at Olembé and acknowledged the systemic failings that brought it about, while keeping the show on the road. Douala, the country’s throbbing economic capital, was alive for the first Cameroon game it has hosted at an Afcon. Soon after 8am vuvuzelas echoed in the area around Marché Ndogpassi, a sprawling complex four miles away from the ground; many among the city’s dense network of streets became almost impassable but the appetite to maintain order around the venue was unmistakable. Along the road that skirts Japoma Stadium’s western side, soldiers bearing rifles stood on roofs or stared down from balconies. They were members of the Bataillon d’Intervention Rapide (BIR), a feared combat unit that reports directly to the president, Paul Biya, and has been the subject of torture allegations in the past. As fans queued to pass through the turnstiles, which were allowed to open five hours before kick-off to ease pressure on access points, they were man-marked by red-capped gendarmes. The heavy-handedness of the spectacle was deliberate and the visual message clear: nobody would be allowed to take chances in gaining entry. It was a problematic point, explicitly reinforcing the blame that has largely been passed on to supporters for Monday’s disaster. The Cameroon sports minister, Narcisse Mouelle Kombi, had felt no shame in finger pointing during the buildup. The beefed-up security presence was required, he said, “to stop the uncivil behaviour of Cameroonians who want to force themselves into the stadium when they do not have entry tickets and negative Covid-19 test results.” A ban on under-11s inside the arena was among the measures he announced. A statement attributed to the team captain, Vincent Aboubakar, had called for “a high sense of discipline and more responsibility”. The hope is that when the Confederation of African Football belatedly produces its report into what occurred in Yaoundé it views the chain of events that cost lives with a greater degree of nuance. Some fans in the more laid-back capital had been at pains to suggest Douala, with its bustle and chaos, carried a high risk of similar problems. In the event there were no significant problems reported: the figure of 36,259 in attendance, just under 80% of capacity as per Covid-19 guidelines, looked accurate to the naked eye and an unwanted test was safely passed. It meant that as António Conceição’s team turned the screw, those who had waited so long could crank up the volume. Strip away the more troubling elements of context and this was everything a Cup of Nations quarter-final should be: a home country backed with ear-splitting levels of goodwill; a dogged, competitive minnow in the Gambia whose luck eventually ran out; a high-tempo performance settled by well-taken goals that mean Cameroon, who will play Egypt or Morocco in the semi-finals, are two games from a historic title on home soil. The precise turf upon which they would triumph remains open to question. Olembé is slated to host their semi-final and the final but its fate rests on Caf’s review; Japoma Stadium is an impressive facility but the condition of its pitch has already cost it a last-four tie and one of Sunday’s quarter-finals. It is a shambolic state of affairs going into the final week of a major tournament, but Cameroon’s players have raised hopes they can leave a positive legacy. They had been mocked beyond their borders for labouring past Comoros, who lacked a specialist keeper, before matters of life and death took hold. For 20 minutes they struggled for rhythm against the Gambia, a likeable group who made no bones about their intention to frustrate. When Aboubakar’s 36th minute header was beaten away by Baboucarr Gaye, who plays in Germany’s fourth tier, the sense was they had met an unlikely goalkeeping nemesis once again. But Cameroon had torn their opponents apart down the flanks and brought the house down with smart finishes by Toko Ekambi, served from either wing in the 12 minutes after half-time. Douala’s football fans could dance into the night, horns honking. An hour after full-time a section of the security personnel were debriefed in one of the stands, departing with a round of their own applause. Their work was done, but a rigorous analysis of the trauma that apparently necessitated it must follow.",Sport/Football,Cameroon progress but sombre day shows Olembé tragedy’s cuts run deep,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/29/cameroon-progress-africa-cup-of-nations-the-gambia
1/30/2022,"Anthony Martial played the pass, Edinson Cavani timed his run to deliver the cross and there was Marcus Rashford to sweep home, the stoppage-time goal giving Manchester United a 1-0 win over West Ham last Saturday and sparking wild scenes at Old Trafford. “Manchester United are targeting West Ham’s top-four place,” roared the TV commentator. “Going Fourth,” declared the front page of the following day’s Observer Sport. And the first thing to say is this was not how United had imagined it at the start of the season.  They opened with a 5-1 home victory over Leeds and the idea was to build on last season’s second place under Ole Gunnar Solskjær and challenge Manchester City for the title. As it is, Solskjær has gone, courtesy of a spectacular implosion, so has Michael Carrick, briefly the interim to the interim, and now the club’s fans, expectations radically downsized, would see it as relative success if they could hold on to fourth in the Premier League ahead of West Ham and the rest – principally Arsenal and Tottenham – under Ralf Rangnick, who will then hand over to a permanent manager. United are in a rare state of uncertainty, prioritising short-term imperatives over a longer-term vision, albeit the latter is fundamental and not unrelated to the former; struggling to locate identity and conviction. Their rivals can see it. United have lost the fear factor. But can those clubs capitalise on the plot line that is set to crackle until the end of the season? Because what is clear is that they, too, have their problems. The stand-out detail of Rashford’s winner was that Rangnick had introduced him, Martial and Cavani as second-half substitutes. It felt a little cobbled together, an illustration of how United have attacking players that they cannot properly accommodate or fulfil. Jesse Lingard is a prime example. Martial has, of course, since departed on loan to Sevilla. But, on the other hand, when Cristiano Ronaldo, Mason Greenwood and Jadon Sancho are factored in, feel the firepower. And that is before the creative midfielders, Bruno Fernandes and the soon-to-be-fit again Paul Pogba, are considered. United have the individuals who can rise above the collective to make the difference at any time, irrespective of their situation. Remember how Lingard scored the winner in the 89th minute at West Ham last September? At West Ham, there is quite the burden on Michail Antonio, the only pure No 9 at the club, although he has been supported by Jarrod Bowen, who is in the throes of a magnificent season, with Saïd Benrahma, Pablo Fornals and Manuel Lanzini chipping in. And the dynamics are similar at Arsenal and Spurs. In the case of the former, it has been magnified by the exile of the centre-forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the latest illustration of Mikel Arteta seeking to establish a culture where discipline for the wider collective good is everything. Alexandre Lacazette has exciting young players around him in Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Martin Ødegaard and Gabriel Martinelli, whose output has been impressive. But can the quartet continue to in effect over-perform, particularly Smith Rowe, who has eight goals in the league? As an aside, can Arteta get anything out of Nicolas Pépé? At Spurs, it has been possible to count on the fingers of one hand how many attacking players have delivered for Antonio Conte – the lone No 9, Harry Kane, and the wingers Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn. It is not enough. At Wolves, who can count themselves as being on the fringes of the race after a fine season, one statistic stands out. They have 19 goals from 21 league games. It is not the kind of form that screams Champions League qualification. It is about quality, first and foremost and when West Ham, say, are able to play their best XI, they can look a match for anybody. Declan Rice is sure to be in the player of the year conversations. Yet it is about depth, too – particularly with the pandemic exerting its remorseless strain – and they have felt the losses to injury of the centre-halves Angelo Ogbonna and Kurt Zouma. The former was ruled out for the season after going off in the eye-catching home win over Liverpool in early November while the latter is only just back from a seven-week absence. Arsenal and Spurs also suffer a significant drop-off when the understudies have to step in and it is a part of the reason why the closing days of the January transfer window are so important. United are the best resourced and yet they have underwhelmed since Rangnick took over in early December, there being little evidence of a new-manager bounce or him making a distinctive mark on the team. Despite the attacking riches, they have found goals difficult to come by during what has been a favourable run of fixtures and the contribution of David de Gea has remained crucial. The opening 70 minutes at Aston Villa were perhaps as well as they have played – some signs of Rangnick-ball? – before they were pegged back to 2-2 and they have rather got away with it in some of their wins. If United must have Champions League football because, without it, the sell to the new manager would be so much harder, then West Ham are simply enjoying the ride. Few people saw this coming from them and it has been a rare challenge; echoes of their run to fifth in 1998-99 under Harry Redknapp, their highest finish of the Premier League era. David Moyes has shaped a team in his image – shrewd, selfless, never-say-die – and the manager must wonder where they would be without the home losses to Brentford, Southampton and Leeds. Only Chelsea have played more league games than West Ham, there has been the charge into the Europa League last 16, plus the Carabao Cup wins over the Manchester clubs, and so the tiredness that has crept in of late has been inevitable. The domestic break offers them the chance to draw breath for the next push, although Antonio will not have his feet up. He has three World Cup qualifiers to play with Jamaica. Arsenal remain enigmatic, capable of quick and well-structured football, performances to light the path to a promising future and then moments when it all goes dark; sometimes within the same 90 minutes. They can take steps forward in one area – the development of Saka and Smith Rowe – and then see a crisis blow up elsewhere, such as the Aubameyang situation. Indiscipline is an issue. Since Arteta took over in December 2019, they have had 14 red cards, more than any club in the division. It often feels draining and the same is true of Spurs, where Conte has grumbled constantly about the squad at his disposal – with justification – giving the impression that job satisfaction can only be a pipe dream but, at the same time, bringing the team up on the rails. He is mindful of the gap to the top and so do not tell him that if Spurs were to win their four games in hand, they would jump above third-placed Chelsea. For Conte, who represents the hope for Spurs and yet is also central to a sense of impending peril, it has to be about the space below Chelsea. The scramble to claim it will be all-consuming.",Sport/Football,Rangnick has the big stars to outflank London rivals in top-four battle | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/29/rangnick-has-the-big-stars-to-outflank-london-rivals-in-top-four-battle
1/30/2022,"Even in his first press conference after Monday’s disaster at the Stade Olembé in which eight fans died, Patrice Motsepe, the president of the Confederation of African Football, was looking to shift the blame. He convened a commission to investigate the causes – it was expected to report on Friday, but is yet to do so – but the avoidance of corporate responsibility had begun already. There was the gate that was “inexplicably” shut. And that, almost certainly, was the direct cause of the buildup of people and the surge towards the open gate that knocked down a temporary barrier and led to people being trampled on. Whoever didn’t open that shut gate will take the blame.  Motsepe also spoke of fans without tickets. Nobody seems to doubt that is true, but neither is it provable – and the stadium was not full to capacity (although it was probably full beyond the supposed 80% cap imposed because of Covid); the problem was not the number of fans but their distribution. A photograph taken well before kick-off shows clearly the problem of a handful of police trying to check a growing crowd of thousands 20 yards or so in front of the fence where the tragedy occurred. But there are causes and there are causes. “Security,” Motsepe said, “is the responsibility of the local organising committee and it is not Caf’s responsibility. Caf’s responsibility is to advise. Caf has no legal obligation and has no responsibility and should not be blamed. But we are partners and it’s not time to point fingers.” Yet he had already done so twice. It’s easy – and not untrue – to say the cause is a basic one of crowd control. There has been talk that yet another perimeter fence had been planned but not built, and of the need for security checks to be conducted more quickly (in Douala on Saturday, they were more complex and slower), and perhaps there is merit in both points, but the fundamental issue was that too many people turned up at the same place at the same time. There may have been soldiers in that area, but looking menacing with an AK47 is of little use – and neither would the rooftop snipers who suddenly appeared on Saturdayyesterday have been – when what was needed was to divert large numbers of people away from the south entrance to the east and north. Clearly, the local organisers must bear responsibility for that. But then, how many major football matches are held in Cameroon? How often do their authorities have to deal with crowds of 60,000? There were 25,000 at Cameroon’s last home World Cup qualifier, and 10,000 at the one before that – and both of those were played not in Yaoundé but in Douala. It’s Caf that hosts tournaments every two years and Caf that has the experience; it cannot sit above the carnage and casually brush off responsibility. There have been suggestions from insiders that Motsepe has been appalled by the disorganisation and lack of leadership he has found at Caf. It has never been the most efficiently run governing body, mired in infighting and corruption, but things clearly got worse since Issa Hayatou’s 29-year reign came to an end with defeat to Ahmad Ahmad in a presidential election in 2017. Ahmad was forced to resign after corruption charges last year and is serving a Fifa-imposed two-year ban from football, with Motsepe, a South African mining tycoon, elected unopposed as his replacement. He was the candidate favoured by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, and the global governing body’s influence within Caf is growing. That may, in time, lead to World Cup-style efficiencies, but it must also be a serious concern. Caf should exist to run and promote African football, not as a voting bloc to support Infantino and his schemes. Infantino was at the Council of Europe this past week, explaining the “need to find ways to include the whole world to give hope to Africans so that they don’t need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea”. A worthy aim, no doubt, but he was clearly talking in the context of staging the World Cup every two years, a plan that may have the support of Caf, or at least the presidents of various vocal federations, but does not seem popular at all among anybody else in African football: delegates, coaches, players, journalists or fans. It’s easy to see why Infantino supports a biennial World Cup: he thinks it would raise more revenues for Fifa (although exactly how much is disputed) and would be a strike against Uefa in their wrangle for political control over the game. But just as it would diminish the Euros, so it would diminish the Cup of Nations – and it’s very hard to see how that benefits African football as a whole. There 24 teams playing in a major tournament of decent standard every two years; who benefits if that is overshadowed by a global tournament that, following the model for the expanded 2026 World Cup would feature nine African sides every two years? Certainly not teams such as the Gambia, Burkina Faso, Equatorial Guinea and Comoros, who have lit up this Cup of Nations and shown how the African middle is rising even if the traditional giants have plateaued. But the truth is that the Cup of Nations is a success despite Caf and not because of it. It’s hardly a new phenomenon, but at every turn the tournament is mismanaged, from the poor accommodation endured by the Gambia and other teams to the dithering and ultimately aborted attempt to play the final minutes of Mali against Tunisia after the referee blew early for full time, to the abject media facilities in Douala, to the appalling fact that two and a half years after the tournament was scheduled to kick off, the Stade Olembé is still unfinished – and, unless more money is found to pay contractors, will remain so. There is a culture of indecisiveness and inaction and that creates an environment in which tragedies such as Monday’s can occur. Caf may, as Motsepe claimed, bear no legal responsibility, but it cannot simply blame somebody else, move on and forget what has happened.",Sport/Football,African football’s indecisive leaders must accept the blame for Olembe tragedy,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/29/african-footballs-indecisive-leaders-must-accept-the-blame-for-olembe-tragedy
1/30/2022,"By Fulham’s recent standards, this was a meagre result. Just when it seemed Marco Silva had the Championship sussed, promotion inevitable, the division threw up another one those oddities, a plot twist to remind us that nothing is a formality in this league. Aleksandar Mitrovic made it 28 goals for the season, three off Ivan Toney’s record-breaking tally last season, but the runaway leaders were ultimately held by Blackpool, for whom this point will provide encouragement that they could again make a run for the play-offs, this time from 14th, after winning promotion from League One via Wembley last season.  Fulham could have feasibly been four goals up in the first seven minutes such was their early domination but Blackpool turned the tide after a medical emergency in the stands, which delayed play for 40 minutes and disrupted Fulham’s rhythm. The game was paused on 13 minutes and, after the referee Peter Bankes directed both teams off the pitch, a man was taken to hospital in an ambulance after suffering a cardiac arrest in the Hammersmith End. Before leaving the field, both sets of players tried to keep warm, zipping passes around and the Blackpool defender Richard Keogh and goalkeeper Daniel Grimshaw were embroiled in conversation, presumably plotting a route back into the game. Fulham had bombarded Blackpool from kick-off, Mitrovic stooping in front of Keogh to meet a Denis Odoi cross with 55 seconds on the clock. A couple of minutes later Fabio Carvalho, a prodigious talent, flicked another Odoi cross goalwards but his effort dribbled towards Grimshaw. Fulham were living up to their status as the most prolific team in Europe – they have scored 74 goals this season, one shy of Norwich’s total in this division last season with 18 games to play – but faded after the enforced first-half break. “I don’t like to find an easy excuse,” Silva said. “I prefer to look at ourselves. The way the game was in the moment, we would score the second goal quickly. I don’t have any doubts about that. You could smell that the second goal would come for us.” The game had threatened to be a nonevent even before Mitrovic tapped in on five minutes but Blackpool somehow managed to survive an early barrage of chances and 10 minutes after the interval replied through Josh Bowler, who was released by Fulham as a youngster and scored the winner when these sides met in September. Bowler was a threat throughout and in the first half he smacked a shot against the crossbar after cutting inside Tim Ream following a powerful run by Shayne Lavery, who got the better of Harrison Reed on halfway. The equaliser arrived when CJ Hamilton pulled the ball back to the fringe of the Fulham penalty area and Bowler powered in a goal that will only add to his valuation as the transfer deadline approaches, with Nottingham Forest among the clubs keen to sign the winger. “I thought he was outstanding,” said the Blackpool head coach, Neil Critchley. “If he is still at the club at 11 o’clock on Monday night then we’ll all be delighted.” With a one-goal lead and the sun piercing through the imposing Riverside Stand, a work in progress set to be opened in time for next season, it looked as though Fulham would add to their advantage. A headed clearance by the Blackpool defender Jordan Thorniley recoiled on to a post and Mitrovic hit the woodwork before Harry Wilson went close to finding Fulham a second goal after latching on to a reverse pass by Reed. Wilson would have had a contender for goal of the season had he found the net when his sumptuous lob dropped wide. He brought a wonderful ball by Tosin Adarabioyo under his spell and then flicked a shot goalwards with his next touch. “We didn’t start the game particularly well, which was my fault,” Critchley said. “We started a little bit tentatively. I said to the players at the break [in the first half]: ‘If we fail, then we fail being us. We’ve got nothing to lose, let’s go for it. If we get exposed and they score, so what? They’ve been scoring goals for fun anyway.’ “In the second half I thought it was an even game. We knew that psychologically the game could be difficult for them, because they’re expected to win.” From there Blackpool successfully dampened Fulham’s mood and could have scored a winner but Marek Rodak saved smartly to deny Hamilton from an acute angle after a poor clearance by the Fulham substitute Nathaniel Chalobah. If this result is not enough to bring Fulham back down to earth, then a trip to Manchester City in the FA Cup next Saturday should do the trick.",Sport/Football,Josh Bowler halts rampant Fulham to earn surprise point for Blackpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/29/fulham-blackpool-championship-match-report
1/30/2022,"Families hit by the cost-of-living crisis are being targeted by credit firms offering “buy now, pay later” deals on weekly groceries, pet food and hot drinks. Shoppers are urged to spread their payments for staple foods and treats to help cope with “these difficult times”. One promotion states: “Regardless of your credit rating, we will offer you a tonne of credit to do your shopping with.”  The sector faces new regulation, but welfare groups warn the new form of credit is “like a runaway train”. The products typically offer interest-free credit with the money paid in three or four instalments over a month or longer. Klarna, the biggest player in the buy now, pay later sector, has focused on partnership deals with retailers selling fashion and household items, but some operators are promoting credit on groceries, fast food and hot drinks. An investigation by the Observer has found:  The tech finance firm Zilch, valued at £1.5bn, is advertising a buy now, pay later deal with superstore Iceland, with ready meals, pet food and fizzy drinks on offer with a first payment of 25% of the shelf price, and the balance paid interest-free over six weeks. The firm also promotes home-delivered food and coffees on interest-free credit.  An online grocery store called Flava is offering buy now, pay later credit to struggling families without credit checks for products from Kellogg’s Coco Pops to Pot Noodle. Its website states: “Stop worrying about how you are going to survive the lockdown.”  Clearpay, one of the biggest buy now, pay later operators, promotes vodka and gin retailers and online sweets stores on its website, where the products can be bought on interest-free credit over six weeks. Mehmet Sezgin, a former board member of MasterCard Europe, and a global retail banking expert, said: “No one should buy perishable items like food on credit. It’s an invitation to indebtedness and bankruptcy.” A report by Bain & Company, a consultancy firm, has estimated the market is worth about £6.4bn a year in the UK, based on industry data, and is used by about 10 million shoppers. The Treasury is to publish proposals later this year on regulating the sector, which is not covered by consumer credit laws because no interest is charged on the debt. Some of the firms do charge transaction fees and penalties for late payments. One in three buy now, pay later users have missed a payment or made a late one, according to a report published last year by the welfare charity Citizens Advice. The report found consumers using the credit products had also been charged £39m in late fees over one year. Rachel Beddow, principal policy manager at Citizens Advice, said: “It is like a runaway train. You can shop 24 hours a day and easily lose track of how much you owe, and there’s not enough protection for people who end up slipping into debt.” The UK firm Zilch, which describes itself as the “fintech darling of the UK”, is one of the first buy now, pay later providers to be operating with consumer credit authorisation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), but faces scrutiny over its promotion of its product for groceries, beverages and home-delivered food. Zilch has advertised on Facebook that consumers can “pay back over six weeks” for Domino’s Pizza and Uber Eats. It also advertised that consumers can pay in four interest-free instalments for their coffees. The firm was last week advertising buy now, pay later at Iceland. Two large salmon fillets were promoted for a “1st payment” of £1.50; a box of 40 pouches of Winalot dog food was promoted for a “1st payment” of £2.25; and a carton of 24 cans of Whites fizzy lemonade was promoted for a “1st payment” of £1.75. The remaining balance of the shelf price is paid over six weeks. Online food store Flava has pioneered buy now, pay later for groceries, offering “£100 credit guaranteed”. The website, which says it offers a “tonne of credit”, says: “If you’ve struggled with credit in the past, a needless search on your credit file will only damage it further, which is why we don’t do it.” The repayments can be made over four weeks and are interest-free. Many of the Flava promotions are for products high in sugar and fat. Its special offers last week included 2.7kg jar of Original Choc Nibbles for £18.99 and a Dobsons Cream Soda Mega Lollies jar for £18. Clearpay also promotes buy now, pay later for food and drink. The businesses promoted on its website include Drink Supermarket, Beerhunter, Bottle Bling, the Sweet Shack and Happy Candy UK. A review by the FCA’s former interim chief executive, Christopher Woolard, into the unsecured credit market, published in February last year, said buy now, pay later could be a useful tool, but a shopper could quickly amass £1,000 of credit using multiple lenders and it could cause consumer harm. Michael Donald, a former director of Visa UK and founder of the UK digital payment app ImageNPay, said: “There needs to be tighter controls to block certain categories which are a fast track for the less fortunate in society to spiral into debt.” Zilch says it offers a better, more affordable option for consumers than credit cards and does not permit any instalment payments on items costing less than £5. It also offers its customers to pay by debit in one payment and earn cashback. Philip Belamant, founder and chief executive, said: “Customers can choose to pay in four instalments, which tend to be £45-£65 purchases, or pay in one with debit. We’re educating consumers. Zilch can be used as a traditional credit card alternative without the interest or any fees for late payments.” The company said it had safeguards for customers, which included freezing further spending when an instalment has not been paid. Clearpay said: “We enable customers to make interest-free purchases without the risk of falling into a revolving debt trap.” Flava did not respond to a request for comment. Alex Marsh, head of Klarna UK, said: “Unlike credit card providers, who for decades have kept people in debt with sky-high credit limits, minimum payments and rip-off interest rates, our BNPL products are interest and fee free and provide consumers with a clear repayment schedule.” Laybuy, another leading buy now, pay later provider, said its credit is not intended to be used for groceries, alcohol or fast food. A FCA spokesperson said:“Buy now, pay later products need to come into regulation. It is vital the law, which sets our remit, adapts as the market innovates, so new products and services develop in a way that benefits consumers and that action can be taken to prevent harm.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Buy now, pay later grocery schemes are a ‘debt trap’ for struggling families",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/29/buy-now-pay-later-grocery-schemes-are-a-debt-trap-for-struggling-families
