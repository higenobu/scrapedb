1/2/2022,"England reported a record high daily total of 162,572 new cases on Saturday, up from 160,276 the previous day, official data showed.. The government said a further 154 people had died in England within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19.  Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 174,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The data normally also includes Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but did not on Saturday because of differences in reporting schedules over the new year weekend. The figures come as the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said further restrictions in England must be a “last resort” and that the UK must prepare to “live alongside” coronavirus in 2022. But he said the record-breaking wave of the Omicron Covid variant would “test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter”. It came as an NHS leader warned the next few days would be crucial in the fight to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said staff were working “flat out” and that the NHS was under “arguably more pressure” than this time last year. In a thread on Twitter, he wrote: “NHS preparing for worst & hoping for best. Staff flat out, esp. given level of staff absences. We will need to ask them to perform flexible heroics again if hospital Covid numbers continue to rise. “We can’t keep doing this. Long-term NHS capacity issues must be addressed.”He said the booster vaccination campaign was “significantly more resource-intensive”, and staff absences meant the NHS was “beyond full stretch”.",News/World news,"Covid cases in England hit new record high of 162,572",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/covid-cases-in-england-hit-new-record-high-of-162572
1/2/2022,"Good news has been in short supply for England’s cricketers during this Ashes series but some arrived for Mark Wood in the shape of the new year honours list: his father was awarded an OBE for services to pensioners for his work at the Department for Work and Pensions in the north-east. Derek Wood was also among the first to sample his son’s speeds in the back garden at home in Ashington. “We had to stop when I was about 13,” the younger Wood told me six years ago, shortly after winning his first Test call-up. “We had a long thin garden and I’d charge in from the conifers at the back. I kept hitting him on the head.”  Fast forward to the present day, with England 3-0 down and only a whitewash to dodge, and it is hard not to sigh when pondering Wood and a missed opportunity. Jofra Archer has been a loss, no question, but for the first time in a long time – perhaps going back to Frank Tyson in 1954-55 – England still pitched up in Australia with the fastest bowler on either side; certainly the fastest in a generation of Englishmen and, in terms of sustained pace in Test cricket, the fastest in the world. The latter may surprise a few people but the analysts CricViz only have it one way: since the start of 2020 no Test quick can top Wood’s average speed of 88.2mph (142kph), while his pace on this tour, averaging 90mph (144.91kph), is the highest by a visiting bowler to Australia since Hawk-Eye data began in 2006. Four years on from a 4-0 Ashes defeat that highlighted England’s need for speed, here it is. But for how long? Wood’s physical hardiness has been questionable in the past but since lengthening his run-up and smoothing things out at the end of 2018 he is now consistently producing eye-popping numbers on the speed gun. Yet with him about to turn 32, his best work coming overseas and with white-ball specialism clearly an option in his final years, the sight of Wood in the whites of England haring in should be savoured. Pace isn’t everything. A skiddy trajectory from 5ft 11in makes the ideal length a tricky balancing act on these surfaces and five wickets at 32 does not jump off the page (even if he beat the bat with such regularity in Brisbane as to wonder whether he had walked under ladder). Nevertheless, seeing David Warner’s back leg twitch at the point of release, Steve Smith nick off for 12 at the Gabba to a smart plan executed at 91.6mph or Marnus Labuschagne similarly edging behind for one at the MCG, there have been flashes of what might have been for England had the batters not wilted. “We know we haven’t scored the runs to help the bowling attack,” said Jos Buttler. “Woody has bowled fantastically well and any time he has the ball in hand it’s exciting. When someone can bowl at that pace – and from ball one he’s up at that mark – it’s an incredibly exciting asset to have in your team. “At times he’s bowled without much luck as well. At Melbourne he could certainly have picked up more wickets for how well he bowled. “But yeah, we know that we haven’t scored the runs to give the bowling attack that sort of base that we’ve needed. Having kept to him, he is bowling as quick as ever and he looks fantastic.” Chris Silverwood is a good man and the head coach deserves sympathy as he sits in isolation in Melbourne. Cricket-wise there have been too many errors on this tour, however, and the decision to rest Wood in Adelaide after bowling 25.1 overs in the first Test must sit among them. Silverwood and Joe Root spoke of a need for Wood to play a fuller role later in the series, but this was just one example of their failure to grasp that defeat in the second Test meant there would be no “later in the series”. The phrase “it’s a marathon, not a sprint” kept coming out, when England simply had to burst out of the blocks. Having bowled in only two innings through the inadequacies of others, and with six days of rest between matches boosted to eight thanks to the battergeddon in Melbourne, there seems little reason why Wood will not play in the fourth Test at Sydney, starting on Wednesday. The SCG has replaced the MCG as the pitch that causes the most angst locally these days and, if as flat as expected, his clear point of difference may well be required to transcend conditions. Elsewhere, however, England have slightly painted themselves into a corner, dropping Rory Burns and Ollie Pope in Melbourne and seeing little difference in the result. The former has been working with Graham Thorpe in the nets to calm down his idiosyncratic movements but may not get an instant return unless concerns over Haseeb Hameed’s retreat prove too great. Should England decide they want to look to the future, it may also be that Jonny Bairstow at No 6 drops out after just one Test. If so, Dan Lawrence could find himself the latest reserve asked to play without meaningful preparation. Australia will be forced into at least one change with Travis Head, their leading run scorer of these Ashes, having tested positive for Covid-19. All other results came back negative and logically Usman Khawaja should feature at the ground where his 171 four years ago ground England into the dust. There are further decisions to be made, with Scott Boland perhaps dropping down now Jhye Richardson is fit again, despite the 32-year-old’s remarkable figures of six for seven at the MCG. Ultimately, Pat Cummins and his head coach, Justin Langer, do not have to stress too much, even if their batters will still need to be on high alert when Wood starts charging in from the conifers once more.",Sport/Sport,England’s missed opportunities leave Mark Wood hoping to stop whitewash | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/01/englands-missed-opportunities-leave-mark-wood-hoping-to-stop-whitewash
1/2/2022,"Jos Buttler says a chastening Ashes campaign – for himself and England – has not diminished his desire to remain a three-format player in international cricket. The 31-year-old wicketkeeper-batter has long since established himself as one of the leading limited-overs players in the world but so far his tour of Australia has continued a 56-cap Test career that, while not without highlights, is yet to live up to the same billing. Though a determined 207-ball rearguard on the final day of the second Test in Adelaide was commendable after coming in on a pair, dropped catches in that match and a rash dismissal during England’s first-innings collapse at the MCG have contributed to the 3-0 scoreline that leaves the tourists playing for pride in Sydney and Hobart.  Asked if he still wanted to pursue Test cricket given his young family, his obvious market value in the less labour-intensive shorter formats and the recent decision by South Africa’s Quinton de Kock to become a white-ball specialist, Buttler said: “It’s certainly my ambition. I don’t think I’d have put as much into it as I have done if it wasn’t. “I have fantastic family support – they’re very supportive of me and my career, and make a lot of sacrifices for that. It’s certainly maintained my drive and ambition to try and play [Test cricket].” On De Kock, Buttler said: “That’s Quinton’s own personal situation. As a huge fan of his, I’m disappointed that he’s at that stage. I love watching him bat, keep wicket and play Test cricket. I commend him for making a decision that’s right for him. But I feel I’ve got that support and in a place where I want to try to make it work.” As such, the next two Tests represent an important time for Buttler and a number of teammates who want to secure places on the tour of the Caribbean in March. Who will select that squad is not a given, with the position of the head coach, Chris Silverwood, under review while he isolates in Melbourne due to a Covid case in his family. England are yet to report any cases beyond the three coaches and four family members who tested positive this week – Australia similarly cleared their latest tests after Travis Head’s diagnosis – and Buttler believes there is a determination among his teammates to put on a performance for those left behind. He said: “One thing is we’re massively in it all together. We live it all together and we want to play well for each other. It’s frustrating for Chris he’s not here with us – another complication of the tour – but we’re certainly very united. “There is an overriding sense of disappointment and frustration with the situation we’ve found ourselves in. We certainly don’t want to be a team to lose 5-0.” On the off-field distraction of Covid cases, he said: “A year ago, when something like this happened, it was a much bigger shock and more of a worry. At the moment it’s still a worry and waiting for a Covid test is a bit like playing rouletteat the minute.[But] we need to be in a place where Covid doesn’t stop everything. There will be positive cases throughout the tour. We hoped that wouldn’t be the case, but we’re trying to manage it as best as possible.”",Sport/Sport,Jos Buttler insists he has no plans to retire from Test cricket after Ashes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/01/england-jos-buttler-insists-he-has-no-plans-to-retire-from-test-cricket-after-ashes
1/2/2022,"Astrange and unfamiliar noise swirled around the Emirates Stadium at full-time. Strewn across the turf in red and white was the human rubble of a crushing injury-time defeat. Takehiro Tomiyasu and Ben White were out cold. Thomas Partey, hand outstretched, helped them up. And as Arsenal’s exhausted players slowly winched themselves to their feet, the four sides of the ground rose to applaud them: a gesture of approval, pride, perhaps even defiance. Yes, Arsenal had lost to Manchester City again. Yes, it had been largely self-inflicted again. But somehow this did not feel like the other times.  To anyone who lived through the really bad years, who has seen this stadium at its most toxic and disenchanted, who has seen successive generations blanched and brutalised, this in itself was bracingly new. We can argue about how good this Arsenal side actually are, about whether their recent boost in form is any more sustainable than the ones that preceded it. But right now there is a little halo of hope around this club, and it feels like the most fragile and the most important thing at once. Let’s deal with the game first: Arsenal were brilliant for 45 minutes at the start and resolute for 30 minutes at the end with 10 men. Even so, we cannot ignore the fact that, at the pivotal points of the game, City held their nerve and Arsenal lost theirs. This, as much as anything they do tactically or technically, is the true mark of City’s current dominance over English football: no team since Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United has been as adept at leveraging their aura and reputation. Referees get flustered. Opponents do stupid things. The margins for error are so fine that every moment becomes a pressure-point, a high-stress situation, a potential disaster in the making. Does Gabriel clean out Gabriel Jesus and earn a second yellow if he isn’t painfully aware of City’s speed on the counter? Does Granit Xhaka tug desperately at Bernardo Silva’s shirt if he isn’t wary of Silva’s ability to squirm through the tiniest gap at light speed? This is the privilege of champions: even when you’re not at your best, oppositions still have to pretend you are. And yet, for a decent chunk of the game, Arsenal offered the rest of the league a blueprint. They put on a show. The full-backs camped out in the City half. Partey and Martin Ødegaard had the keys to the midfield. Most importantly they had a goal to show for their efforts and it came from the player who more than anyone seems to embody the spirit and basic tactile pleasure of this Arsenal side. There is perhaps no better noise in English football right now than the sound a crowd makes when Bukayo Saka gets the ball in space. Something strange is happening with Saka at the moment. It’s not simply that he’s a brilliant player in a rich vein of form, although he is and he is. It’s more the way people respond to him: Arsenal fans, England fans, rival fans, children, grandparents, people who don’t even like football. People love this guy. People who don’t even watch football like Saka. Hard-bitten fans in the Clock End who have spent decades screaming abuse at anyone bold enough to step within earshot melt like marshmallows in his presence. Consider: this is a guy who misses the crucial penalty in a European Championship final, England’s first major men’s final for 55 years, and somehow he doesn’t get turned into a pizza advert or a punchline or a meme. Instead, people love him more. People clutch him to their hearts a little tighter. People feel for him. One could see it in the way he disappeared into the crowd after scoring his goal: a sea of bobbing heads and screaming faces and phone screens. Grown men and women ruffled his hair and shouted things into his ear and threw their arms towards him, hoping to touch the hem of his garment. On one level, it was merely the futile first goal in a 2-1 defeat. But as a moment of pure human connection it was the most powerful moment of the day, and by extension the year. Saka has already survived. He knows what tough times feel like. Last year he was Arsenal’s player of the season in a thoroughly joyless, depressing campaign. Doubtless there will be tougher times to come too, particularly in this flawed and improving young team still trying to find its place in the world. But somehow in the bear pit of modern football, a place that feels angrier and more balkanised with every passing week, this 20-year-old man still manages to turn out every week and show us a little joy. And that, at least, is something worth holding on to.",Sport/Football,Arsenal floored but Saka and co left wearing a little halo of hope | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/01/arsenal-floored-but-bukayo-saka-and-co-left-wearing-a-little-halo-of-hope
1/2/2022,"“How have we managed to sign this guy?” There is something a little vague and apocryphal about the oft-quoted reaction of one unnamed Celtic player to seeing Virgil van Dijk in training on his first day at the club. Van Dijk was 22 at the time and a late bloomer, rejected as a teenager by Willem II (“too many limitations”), and more recently by Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord, with two decent seasons at Groningen to recommend him.  Celtic paid £1.74m up front for Van Dijk. And exactly how this came to pass remains an excellent question, one that speaks to Van Dijk’s own slow-burn rise from the fringes of Dutch football; through the meandering promise of his early years (as the journalist Simon Kuper put it: “a first-rate player with a second-rate career”); to that period between 2018-2020 when he stood apart in his own clear, clean space as the best pure defender in world football. Sunday’s trip to Stamford Bridge is an anniversary game for Liverpool and Van Dijk. It is almost exactly four years since he made his debut against Everton at Anfield, four years since the club paid what was then a world-record transfer fee for a defender. At the time Van Dijk had never played in the Champions League knockout stages and had made only 16 appearances for his country. This was a signing based on that same sense of double-take, the rare combination of poise, physical ease, leadership vibes and a feeling that this was a footballer yet to reach out into the outer limits of his own grand talent. As Van Dijk prepares for what will be – or would have been, or might still be – a mouthwatering personal battle with Romelu Lukaku, a centre-forward yet to score in six games against him, another very distinct quality stands out. Van Dijk is that genuinely rare thing: the magic-bullet player, the jigsaw-piece signing, a moment of one-man team-completion. Football really doesn’t work like this very often. The variables, 11 to the power of 11, are too vast. The parts are constantly shifting. There is, every time you walk out, an opposition to contend with. One perfect part to complete the perfect team: it just doesn’t happen. At which point, enter Lukaku, who was also signed, or so it seemed, as the final stroke in some evolving masterplan. Here was a European champion team with one gapingly obvious, forehead- slapping, football-for-dummies hole in its frontline. Just add one cutting-edge centre-forward. Then press go and stand back. How’s that working out, anyway? It is extraordinary to think that in early September Lukaku could be seen fist pumping and badge-slapping back at the Matthew Harding end as the Chelsea fans sang his name, fresh from terrorising the Aston Villa defence. Fast-forward three months and Lukaku has just given a startlingly tin-eared and, as far as Chelsea’s fans are concerned, bizarrely cold interview to Sky Sports Italy: talking in awed tones of his dream of signing for various other clubs, of his undying love for his previous employers, and threatening to leave because the system isn’t to his liking. There is no doubt that footballers think these things all the time, that they talk like this in private. Football isn’t a cobble-close community fairytale. Players do not ruffle the hair of small boys and girls as they catch the bus to the ground and feel deep in their souls the ties that bind them to these distant global super-clubs But talking like this in earshot of the people who pay to watch, who just want to dream a little, to believe against all logic that this feeling is mutual, is brutal stuff. And however this situation ends up resolving itself, Van Dijk to Liverpool looks a little more stark, even more of an outlier. It is worth remembering that Van Dijk turned up at Anfield looking a little underdone, three weeks since his last game for Southampton. He scored against Everton in that debut game, but his next two were defeats to Swansea and West Brom, with Van Dijk a little fogged and rusty, whirling around at times like a man being menaced by a cloud of midges. Steadily something settled. By the end of January there was already a sense of some precision-cut shape being eased into its groove. As winter dissolved into spring Liverpool set off on that freewheeling run of slightly wild attacking football that took them all the way to the Champions League final, but which also featured 11 clean sheets. The next two and a half years would bring a Champions League triumph, a Club World Cup gong, a league title, and in Van Dijk’s case, a rare sense of sustained, frictionless excellence; a period bookended by Jordan Pickford’s horrendous assault on his ankle in October last year and the nine-month hiatus that followed. Two things stand out now about the golden age of Virgil. First, that Liverpool team was prepped and ready, the system grooved, primed and easily understood. Jürgen Klopp’s centre-backs are asked to defend one on one, to cover the full-backs, to curate that risky high line. Van Dijk was ready for this, a pure central defender in the classic mould, with a rare ability to take defensive soundings, to obsess over details of covering and blocking and marking. Van Dijk has always had a curiosity about systems, a thirst for learning that his earliest coaches noticed. There is a theory he benefited in the long term from the lack of high-end academy training in those slow-burn years, from the need to work the game out for himself. It is a quality he will require once again as he enters another phase in his career. It is still a little startling to witness the moments of everyday slackness that have crept into Van Dijk’s game as Liverpool have struggled to regain their own champion pitch, as the midfield in front of him has shifted, as Van Dijk has searched to regain his explosive agility. This is perhaps a little unfair. The balance in any team is impossibly delicate. The combination of forces that led to the magic bullet years has been replaced by another haystack of variables. And the default option in football is always uncertainty. Scroll down the list of all-time Premier League signings, through Grealish-Lukaku-Pogba-Maguire-Sancho-Pépé-Arrizabalaga-Havertz, and only one player in the £70m-plus bracket – the Dutchman at No 6 – has managed to escape that sense of make do and mend. If the trip to Chelsea, the duel manqué with Lukaku, tells us anything it is that the golden age of Virgil really was a startlingly rare exception.",Sport/Football,Misfiring magic bullets: Lukaku meets Van Dijk at moment of mutual toil | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/01/romelu-lukaku-virgil-van-dijk-chelsea-liverpool
1/2/2022,"Prevailing attitudes towards Afcon among Premier League clubs are often unhealthy but, for those with a genuine love for the sport itself, it is one of the most captivating spectacles around. This year’s edition, postponed from 2021, will be played in Cameroon; the competition has become used to late scares over its hosting and has had to overcome concerns over Omicron and the reluctance of European sides to release their players. But once the Indomitable Lions kick off against Burkina Faso on 9 January attention will rest on the pitch. It should be an open tournament, contested by some of the world’s best players, with the 2019 finalists, Algeria and Senegal, the teams to beat. About 40 of the players taking part are England-based, while the commitment shown by Sky and the BBC in screening every game is testament to the tournament’s invigorated global profile.  The World Cup play-offs reliably offer some of the most exhilarating, nail-biting tension around and this year is unlikely to be different. In Europe a new format sees three mini-tournaments start at the semi-final stage on 24 March and conclude, five days later, with a set of knife-edge shootouts for a place at Qatar 2022. Should things go as expected, Portugal will face Italy in one of them; Wales could play Scotland in another and it would be heartening to see home nations’ interest next winter extend beyond England. Elsewhere, five African teams will emerge from a set of intense two-legged ties with a World Cup berth: the draw will be made this month and Mali, in particular, may fancy a first qualification. Further play-offs pitting an Asian side against a South American team, and Concacaf representatives against one from Oceania, will take place in Qatar during the summer. Fulham and Bournemouth have threatened to run away with the Championship at times and, as a later point will cover, that is no good thing. But they have serious competition from Blackburn, outsiders at the start of the season but third by a whisker after taking 22 points from the last available 24. The picture below that is reliably chaotic, with teams as far down as 12th-placed Sheffield United harbouring realistic ambition of a play-off push. All of life can still be found in England’s second tier for now, even if it appears at perpetual risk of becoming more stratified than ever. If the tension does dry up at the top then not to worry: in the nether regions Wayne Rooney’s Derby, deducted 21 points and operating with a patchwork squad, have embarked on a run that puts them in with a shout of what would surely be the most unlikely survival of all time. Time was when Arsenal Women had a stranglehold on the domestic game. They had won seven straight titles when the Women’s Super League was inaugurated in 2011 and immediately added two more. But they have won only one of the subsequent eight and were not expected to topple the lavishly resourced Chelsea or Manchester City this time around. With the halfway stage looming, though, they lead Emma Hayes’ side by four points while City are nowhere. Under Jonas Eidevall, a young Swede who increasingly looks to have been an inspired replacement for Joe Montemurro last summer, Arsenal have improved significantly and played some delightful attacking football. It goes without saying that Vivianne Miedema, second in the division’s scoring charts, has been fundamental to their title charge; she is out of contract in the summer but, should Arsenal be able to roll back the years to reign supreme once more, it might become easier to make her stay. Only three Uefa Women’s Championships have been staged since England last hosted the tournament but Euro 2005 feels a lifetime away. Back then the hosts finished bottom of Group A and the final between Norway and the eventual champions, Germany, drew just over 21,000 fans to Ewood Park. Nowadays England, semi-finalists in 2017, can be considered among the favourites and should be spurred on by a tide of euphoria. The stock of the women’s game has never been higher and should only grow this summer, with no serious competition in the footballing calendar. Euro 2022 was originally Euro 2021 but found itself moved back in the calendar after Covid-19 meant the men’s Euro 2020 was postponed; it will be worth the wait, with 10 venues around the country giving access to a wide distribution of fans, and if Sarina Wiegman’s team go all the way, the Wembley final will be the summer’s hottest ticket. The two brightest young strikers in Europe will probably lead the summer’s transfer chatter. In an ideal world Dusan Vlahovic would stay at Fiorentina, watch a successful team be built around him and cement a legacy akin to that of Gabriel Batistuta. But nobody with the 21-year-old striker’s potential is allowed to stick around outside the biggest clubs for long nowadays and, given he has rejected a new contract, he will almost certainly be with a Champions League big hitter next season. Vlahovic, who has scored 16 in 19 for a mid-table side this season, could plausibly fill a centre-forward vacancy – if there really is one – at Manchester City. Similar questions will be asked about Erling Braut Haaland, whose early-career feats have been even more remarkable. If Vlahovic’s inevitable departure speaks wearily of football’s modern-day market forces then the idea Haaland must leave Borussia Dortmund to better himself is even more grim and it seems likely he will take his phenomenal goalscoring capacities to England or Spain for 2022-23. The second weekend of the 2022-23 season will mark three decades since a Premier League ball was first kicked in earnest. It has become a runaway train, cannibalising the vast majority of its competition, and the brutal truth is that even its lower-ranked sides can outspend all bar a tiny handful of their contemporaries elsewhere in Europe. The current campaign features 12 of those who were pioneers in 1992 and that does suggest a reasonable degree of mobility across the divisions has been sustained. But the more recent proliferation of yo-yo sides such as Norwich, Fulham and West Brom serves as a warning that diversity is becoming limited, as does the remorseless accrual of points at the top by Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool. The quality might be high but, after a year when its leading lights disgraced themselves by attempting to found the European Super League, there is little sign that the top flight has serious interest in helping the rest keep up. A welcome 30th birthday present might be a little humility and a dose of awareness that a healthy bigger picture would make the “product” even more attractive and less predictable. A dozen years after winning the rights, Qatar opens its doors to the world amid the most jumbled-up feelings. Everyone loves World Cups: they are precious and all the more so for taking place every four years, which is one of the reasons Fifa’s attempt to rush in a biennial format must be stopped. But this one takes place under an inescapable cloud and the best thing football can do is try to strike a balance. If this tournament has anything like the on-pitch drama of Russia 2018 and Euro 2020, it will be the most entrancing of diversions as the nights get colder and shorter; the profile that brings must count for something, though, given the long list of human rights concerns that have dogged the hosts. National teams can take a stand, as Denmark have in pledging to step up their public criticism of Qatar over the coming months. The real test for this World Cup, far beyond its entertainment value, will be whether it has lived up to its own billing as a force for lasting good.",Sport/Football,"From the women’s Euros to Qatar World Cup, 2022’s football highlights",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/from-promotion-races-to-superstar-signings-2022s-football-highlights
1/2/2022,"Desperate residents in China’s western Xi’an city are running out of food after they were barred from grocery shopping in a fierce lockdown. In the southern province of Guangxi, people who broke Covid laws were recently publicly shamed by being paraded through the streets in Hazmat suits with placards round their necks. The rest of the world is learning, slowly and with some difficulty, to live with Covid-19, but in China, authorities are doubling down on their “zero-Covid” policy: trying to stamp out the disease whenever it appears, and at any cost. A single case in a border town led to 200,000 people being locked down late last month.  A key aspect of the policy is border closures. Few people are allowed in or out of China, and those who do enter the country face up three weeks of government-enforced quarantine. Some other countries locked the world out for over a year in a bid to lock out the pandemic. But in 2022, Beijing is treading an increasingly solitary path. A combination of mass vaccination, social pressure and highly transmissible new variants has persuaded other once “zero-Covid” countries – including Australia, New Zealand and Singapore – to begin slowly opening up again to the world. Inside China, some senior scientists and officials have also taken the political risk of calling for similar reopening, in recognition of a world where it seems Covid will become endemic. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested recently that the country could be ready when vaccination rates pass 85%, perhaps early in 2022. Others have joined scientists abroad, warning that even Beijing’s autocratic powers and popular support for lockdowns and other control measures may not be enough to keep highly transmissible new variants out. “China will have great difficulty with Omicron and a zero Covid policy,” Tulio Oliveira, director of South Africa’s Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation, said on Twitter. He is part of the team that first alerted the World Health Organisation to the new variant. “They may need to join the rest of the world with mitigation strategies. China should not punish its public health officials or citizens or foreigns because (of) a more transmissible variant.” Whatever the cost, China is likely to push extremely hard to keep the virus under control for most of this year, ahead of two high-profile, high-stakes events. Next month, Beijing will host the winter Olympics, a gathering already dogged by diplomatic boycotts over human rights abuses. In the autumn the Communist leadership will meet for their 20th Party Congress: it is expected to officially extend Xi Jinping’s hold on power by another five years. Authorities in Beijing will have little appetite for putting either the Games or the Party Congress in jeopardy with a Covid outbreak, that would amount to an uncontrolled test of the effectiveness of domestic vaccinations and medical preparations. The health risks of opening China up to Covid are likely to be higher than in countries that abandoned their zero Covid policies, said Sean Yuji Sylvia, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose research focuses on health economics and China’s health system. “There are several reasons why it makes sense for China to maintain strict controls for the time being,” Sylvia said. “China has a high population density and lower herd immunity in the population due to limited exposure to the virus and less-effective vaccines. “The health system is also relatively weak in much of the country and could easily be overwhelmed. And even if vaccines provide good protection against severe cases, patients with less-severe illness are more likely to be hospitalised in China.” The country’s hospitals are also manned by doctors who have little clinical experience of treating Covid, while professionals elsewhere now have two years’ painfully earned understanding of its development and how best to control it. The possible human cost of opening up also has a political dimension. Government and state media have seized on how the virus spread in other countries as evidence of poor leadership and bad decision-making. Abandoning zero Covid could potentially trigger a crisis in hospitals and healthcare that would open the Chinese government to similar criticism. The first few weeks of the pandemic, when hospitals in Wuhan were overwhelmed and the death toll included many medics, fuelled fury and fear nationwide. “China’s zero-Covid policy is driven primarily by social stability concerns. The regime sees Covid, Sars and other epidemics or pandemics as a health crisis that has the potential to evolve into a social crisis,” said Lynette Ong, associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “With that in mind, it is not hard to understand why they are willing to defend it at all cost. But the costs are high. As the rest of world learns how to live with it, China will find itself alone, with few coping mechanisms.” A key sign to watch for, she added is whether the approach to Covid shifts after the leadership decisions are made at the Communist Party Congress. Strict controls have been astonishingly effective so far. Over the past four weeks, when China was battling a relatively large cluster of infections by domestic standards, authorities detected 3,400 cases and no one died. Over the same period, more than 5.7 million people registered Covid infections in the United States, and 36,000 people died of the disease. And as other economies crumbled under the pressure of deaths and lockdowns, China continued to grow But if its path continues to diverge from the rest of the world’s, the costs and challenges of the zero-Covid approach are almost certain to rise. In 2020 and 2021, once China stamped out its initial outbreak, domestic spending picked up. Its factories resumed churning out goods for the world, adding Covid tests and other medical gear to their production line, for a pandemic that seemed to be passing the country by. Now however, the economic calculus has become more complicated. Strict new lockdown and quarantine rules are affecting everything from global supply chains – as sailors wanting to return home must spend weeks in isolation – to factory output. Trade partners are angry at the impact of suddenly imposed new border controls, with more than 6,000 Vietnamese trucks suddenly stranded at one border in late December. If other markets continue to ease Covid-related controls on movement while China remains shuttered, they may be forced to look elsewhere for trade partners.. If Beijing remains sealed off from the world, this may also diminish China’s efforts to project its influence worldwide. This has been a high profile feature of Xi Jinping’s increasingly assertive rule, including his flagship “Belt and Road” initiative, offering investment and aid around the world. But for now, authorities have clearly prioritised the political advantages of a Covid-free China, and are willing to pay a very high price to keep that unusual status in a world where the disease is becoming endemic. “China’s ‘dynamic clearance’ strategy has thus far proven effective at limiting the domestic spread of the disease, albeit with significant cost, effort, and trade-offs,” said Thomas Hale, associate professor in public policy at Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Governance. “The government’s statements since the emergence of Omicron –which have touted the present strategy as a success – suggest that the point of transition (away from zero Covid) is not close, despite some discussion of this in the Chinese media. “Moreover, when it does come, the transition may not be easy because Chinese society has gotten quite used to a low level of transmission.”",News/World news,How much longer can China keep up its zero-Covid strategy?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/china-zero-covid-strategy-beijing-policy-protecting-public-health-coronavirus
1/2/2022,"The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair’s ennoblement this weekend, courtesy of the Queen, has been defended by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Sir Tony, rather than Sir Anthony, as he is now known, has been made a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, 14 years after leaving Downing Street. But the honour has been criticised by Blair’s political opponents and those who argue the legacy of his invasion of Iraq in 2003 makes him unsuitable.  Speaking on Saturday morning Hoyle said he felt the honour, the oldest and most senior British order of chivalry, was “a fitting tribute” for a former prime minister, although he felt it was not a political decision. “Whatever people might think, it is one of the toughest jobs in the world,” the Speaker said, “and I think it is respectful and it is the right thing to do, whether it is Sir David Cameron. They should all be offered that knighthood when they finish as prime minister.” Hoyle was talking to Today programme presenter Martha Kearney on BBC Radio 4 when he was asked if he believed all recent former prime ministers should now be knighted. “If you have been prime minister of this country, I do believe the country should recognise the service given. Absolutely. You finish in the office and when you’ve finished it is the respect that we give to those prime ministers,” he replied. Most attacks on the monarch’s appointment of Blair to the order, membership of which was also given on Saturday to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and to the former Labour cabinet member Lady Amos, the first black person to be honoured this way, have come from the political left, but were picked up by right-leaning media, including the Daily Mail. The newspaper said there had been backlash, quoting satirical tweets from the veteran investigative journalist John Pilger and from former MP George Galloway. Appointments to this ceremonial order are made without prime ministerial advice and are usually announced on St George’s Day, on 23 April. Founded in 1348 by Edward III, it is the oldest and most senior British Order of Chivalry and a recognition of significant public service. Sir John Major, Blair’s predecessor, was the last to receive the honour. “It is not about politics. It is about the position they have held in this country and it’s the respect that we show to those and it is a fitting tribute,” said Hoyle.",News/Politics,Speaker defends Tony Blair knighthood after backlash,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/speaker-defends-tony-blair-knighthood-after-backlash
