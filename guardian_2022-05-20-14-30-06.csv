HR The Predator, Friday, 9pm, Film4 After its instantly iconic first entry, the Predator series has been an exercise in diminishing returns. Predator 2 replaced tension with silliness, and you’d be forgiven for forgetting that 2010’s dismal Predators was ever made. With 2018’s The Predator, though, the balance began to reset. Co-written and directed by Shane Black (who had a small part in the first movie), this is the goriest and funniest of the sequels, which (almost) remembers that the key to a good Predator movie involves simply reacting to the mayhem caused by a merciless alien killer. Not perfect, but a step in the right direction. Stuart Heritage Jackass 4.5, from Friday, Netflix The Jackass movies are produced in a manner that always creates a glut of unseen stunts, so a Jackass 4.5 – recut and filled with snippets previously left on the floor – was always inevitable. But this doesn’t necessarily mean it will be all scraps and offcuts. After all, Jackass 4 was by far the most enjoyable film of the series. With the cast now in middle age, their absurd nihilism came tinged with autumnal melancholy, as if they were finally accepting mortality. If the new clips are as weirdly touching as those in its parent film, this will be terrific. Jackass for ever!

5/20/2022,"A new clean air law is starting out in parliament after the Green party peer Jenny Jones won first place in the House of Lords ballot for private members’ bills. Named Ella’s law, as a tribute to nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah who died from asthma induced by air pollution, the bill would establish a right to clean air and set up a commission to oversee government actions and progress. It would also join policies on indoor and outdoor air pollution with actions to combat our climate emergency, and include annual reviews of the latest science. Jones said: “Having a nice environment isn’t just a matter of ecology and science, it is a question of social justice. The clean air (human rights) bill would enshrine the human right to healthy air precisely and explicitly in UK law. A suitable date for the government to put it into law would be before the 70th anniversary of the Great Smog later this year”. The UK’s first Clean Air Act also began as a private member’s bill, introduced by the handlebar moustached Tory MP Gerald Nabarro. Nabarro’s bill was triggered by a Ministry for Health report that estimated a death toll of about 4,000 people due to the weeklong London smog of 1952, a death rate greater than the Victorian cholera outbreaks and the worst periods of the blitz. Politically, Jones and Nabarro are poles apart but Jones’s bill comes at a time when about 4,000 Londoners die from breathing polluted air each year. UK annual deaths are estimated to be between 28,000 and 36,000, and globally it is about 7 million. Since Nabarro’s bill, thousands of research studies have explored the health harm from air pollution, or, viewed from a different angle, the benefits that could come from cleaner air. Dr Maria Neira, the World Health Organization (WHO) director for public health, environmental and social determinants of health, said: “These days we have overwhelming evidence that air pollution harms health, more than enough evidence to justify actions to reduce exposure. You can imagine the incredible number of lives we will save.” Improving air pollution saves money from reduced absence from work and less cost to the NHS. In parallel to Jones’s bill, the government is asking for views on its own targets for particle pollution in England. These targets for 2040 match the guidelines that were set by the WHO in 2005. Additionally, it is proposed to reduce average particle pollution by 35%. According to government analysis, the benefits from these actions would be five times greater than the money than spent cleaning our air.",News/Environment,‘Ella’s law’ bill seeks to establish right to clean air in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/ellas-law-bill-right-to-clean-air-uk-pollution-jenny-jones
5/20/2022,"Parasite eggs found in 4,500-year-old human faeces suggest the builders of Stonehenge took part in winter feasts that included the internal organs of animals, researchers have revealed. Stonehenge is thought to have been built around 2,500BC, with evidence suggesting the builders were housed at a settlement known as Durrington Walls, about 2 miles away. The site was predominantly occupied in the winter months, and appears to have been used for between 10 to 50 years. Experts say they have discovered intestinal parasites in ancient faeces – or coprolites – recovered from the prehistoric rubbish dumps of Durrington Walls, offering new insights into the lives and diet of those who constructed Stonehenge. The team says the preserved stools are not only the oldest coprolites in Britain to contain parasites, but the earliest evidence for parasite infection in Britain where the species of the hosts are known. “It is the earliest where we know the origin of the person who went to the toilet,” said Dr Piers Mitchell, of the University of Cambridge, a co-author of the study. Writing in the journal Parasitology, Mitchell and colleagues report how they found 19 coprolites at Durrington Walls, five of which contained intestinal parasites. Analysis of substances such as bile acid within the faeces revealed four of these coprolites were from dogs and one from a human, with both the latter and three of the canine specimens containing eggs of a parasitic worm known as a capillaria – these eggs show similarities to those of a species that infects cattle today. The team says the discovery suggests the builders of Stonehenge, and their dogs, ate undercooked offal from infected cattle. Mitchell said: “It shows that they were eating the internal organs of the cattle, especially their liver, because that’s where these parasites lived. It wasn’t just that they were scraping the meat off the bone and then chucking the rest away. “It looks like they were sort of sharing their food with their companion animals, or at least giving them the leftovers.” The other canine coprolite was found to contain the eggs of fish tapeworm, suggesting the animal had eaten raw or undercooked freshwater fish. Mitchell said it seemed likely the dog was already infected when it arrived at Durrington Walls, given the site was only occupied for brief periods at a time and it takes some months after infection before a fish tapeworm starts to produce eggs. In addition, neither bones nor evidence of oil from freshwater fish have been found at the settlement. The team notes that previous discoveries of pig and cattle bones at Durrington Walls suggested its inhabitants held meaty winter feasts. “[There is also] early evidence for milk and cheese and those kinds of fascinating things,” said Mitchell, adding that previous work suggested the builders brought their animals with them when they travelled to Stonehenge. But, he said, it was unclear if the feasts were rare and special occasions, or whether the villagers chipped away at their supply of meat every night. Mike Pitts, an archaeologist who was not involved in the study, said the finds were exciting. “So little [information from the time] survives, so any new window you can open on to that past is hugely valuable,” he said. Pitts added that the results appeared to challenge previous studies that emphasised pigs as a source of meat for the Stonehenge builders, and that no fish was consumed. Nevertheless, he suggested the explanation could be that Durrington Walls was a busy, complex place where people with different customs had come together for the great build. Ultimately, he said, it was important to consider all types of finds. “Any one type of evidence is not going to give you the full story,” he said.",News/UK news,"Stonehenge builders ate undercooked offal, ancient faeces reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/stonehenge-builders-undercooked-offal-ancient-faeces-parasites
5/20/2022,"With the dust settling on the Metropolitan police’s long investigation into Covid breaches inside Downing Street, one big question remains: how did Boris Johnson escape with just one fine? Legal experts say it defies logic – and to many voters, it defies common sense too. This is, however, a mystery that appears unlikely to be solved any time soon. It’s not that the PM and his wife got off scot-free. Johnson and Carrie did break Covid laws. Last month, they received fixed-penalty notices (FPNs) for attending the prime minister’s birthday celebration in June 2020, as did Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, who reportedly made just a fleeting appearance. But while Johnson is known to have been at up to five other events for which FPNs have been issued, and reportedly poured drinks at one of them, he has escaped further punishment. What appeared most anomalous, according to Adam Wagner, the Doughty Street Chambers barrister who is an expert on Covid rules, is how Johnson attended gatherings deemed to have breached the rules without himself being fined. “We still don’t know very much about how the regulations work, because the higher courts haven’t looked at this,” Wagner said. “But generally, the decision is difficult to understand. The way the regulations are drafted is that the gathering itself has to be reasonably necessary, and the reason why somebody participates is not really relevant.” To escape a fine, Wagner added, Johnson would have needed to provide a reasonable excuse: “But I don’t understand how you could ever reasonably attend an illegal gathering, unless you attended by accident, realised and left very quickly. I don’t see why, if the prime minister had a reasonable excuse for attending, the other people attending wouldn’t.” One possible escape would be if the police viewed events as more than one gathering – for example as reasonably necessary for work when Johnson was there, but descending into socialising after he left. However, Wagner noted, this would appear to be contradicted by reports such as Johnson pouring drinks. Another get-out raised by Johnson allies is the fact that Downing Street is both his workplace and home. However, a change to Covid regulation at the end of May 2020 specifically ended being in your own home as a potential loophole. Ultimately, without knowing what evidence the police received, it is impossible to be certain why Johnson was fined for the one event and not others. And given the nature of the Met’s inquiry, this evidence will not be aired in public, beyond whatever necessarily anonymised summary appears in the report of the senior official, Sue Gray, next week. It is one of the several curiosities of Partygate that it involved huge stakes, not least the political survival of a prime minister, while simultaneously being centred on what are, in strictly legal terms, relatively low-level offences. “Yes, this was people breaking rules they had made themselves, which is important,” one criminal lawyer noted, speaking anonymously. “But at that the same time, you can very easily be fined more for parking on a double yellow line.” The nature of the offences meant they fell into the system of FPNs, which are investigated and levied entirely by the police, with courts only becoming involved if the fine is challenged. Having been forced into an inquiry it had not wanted to undertake by the sheer volume of material gathered by Gray, the Met’s infrequent updates were parsimonious, even opaque, even by the standards of police investigations. While the force was at times criticised for its approach to openness, there is no obligation for someone to declare an FPN; and if they do not challenge it in court, there is no public record of one being received. The Met did have a significant amount of evidence to go through: the team of 12 detectives had access to 345 documents, among them witness statements, emails and door logs for one of the UK’s most secure addresses, as well as more than 500 photographs and CCTV images. However, no one suspected of wrongdoing was formally interviewed. Instead, police received 204 questionnaires filled out by people identified as connected to the gatherings. This was another complicating factor – some people would have been notably more open and voluble with their answers than others. “If someone was sent one of those questionnaires and they went to me, I’d say: don’t answer it,” the criminal lawyer said. “You’ve got no obligation to fill it in. You’re not under arrest. You’ve not even been cautioned. If you tell the truth, you might be fined, and if you lie, you’re potentially committing another offence. So why risk it?” Overall, Wagner said, the lack of transparency from a police-only investigation was “unsatisfactory”. “The reality of it is that the Metropolitan police have decided there were at least eight illegal gatherings over the course of a year,” he said. “And the prime minister appears to have attended six of them. You think about how careful other workplaces were being, and the actual people who were writing the rules were treating them with a wanton disregard.” A more legally comprehensible outcome, he said, would have been if police had fined Johnson just for the birthday party while decreeing that the only other illegal gatherings were three others he did not attend – a Christmas party in December 2020 and the two events on the same night in April last year, the night before Prince Philip’s funeral. “It’s right that they take a cautious approach. And if they had said the other gatherings were on the borderline, so we’re not going to act, I would have thought that was quite liberal of them, but it would have an internal logic,” Wagner said. “But they have given people criminal penalties for a series of illegal gatherings, just not the prime minister. I think he’s lucky to have got away with it.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson and Partygate: how did PM only get one fine?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-and-partygate-how-did-pm-only-get-one-fine
5/20/2022,"A “dinosaur revolution” is taking place with a new species being discovered every week, the makers of a groundbreaking new docuseries exploring life on Earth 66m years ago have said. Prehistoric Planet, produced by BBC Studios’ Natural History Unit and premiering on Apple TV on Monday, is narrated by Sir David Attenborough and features original music composed by the multiple Oscar winner Hans Zimmer. The show brings together huge names from across the industry including the executive producers Jon Favreau, who has been involved in a string of Hollywood blockbusters including the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and Mike Gunton, whose previous credits include the Bafta and Emmy-winning documentary Planet Earth II. Gunton told the Guardian the five-part series combines wildlife film-making, the latest discoveries in palaeontology and cutting-edge CGI technology to recreate the dinosaurs that inhabited Earth, in a one-of-a-kind immersive experience. “The late Cretaceous period is a whole extraordinary world we haven’t turned our natural history cameras on,” he said. “This was an incredibly diverse, rich time of life. We tend to be very focused on today, but the animals that lived during that period were complex, sophisticated creatures. They were marvellous and miraculous.” Darren Naish, the show’s consultant palaeontologist, said it was the perfect time to make a show that explored how dinosaurs lived, including the relationships between them. “What’s key is we’re in the middle, right now, of a dinosaur revolution,” he said. “Since the 1990s there’s been an enormous surge in number of new species being discovered, with around about a new dinosaur species discovered every week. That’s more than 50 a year. No one can keep up with this.” In China, Naish said, researchers have discovered soft tissues on dinosaur remains – skin, feathers, fossil eyeballs and fossil lungs. This, combined with modern technology, allows for new takes on the creatures’ biology, behaviour and evolutionary history, he said. “For example, T rexes must have courted to make babies, but how did they actually go through the courtship?” For the series, they used a technique called phylogenetic bracketing, which takes into account the family tree of the animals. “For a dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus, it’s surrounded on one side by crocodiles and alligators and on the other side birds, which are living dinosaurs. You look at what’s present in those species and if there’s similarities, you can sensibly infer that for your extinct animal as well.” The more we learn about the past, he said, the better we can understand the present and future. “Everyone involved in science is aware of the climate crisis and the human impact on the planet. You can say that the particular things that made the Cretaceous world the way it was, like high CO2 levels, loads more water vapour in the atmosphere, therefore higher sea levels and less ice, is the world we are actually creating now through our own actions. “It was great for dinosaurs and seagoing reptiles. Sea levels were tens of metres higher, all of the low coastal areas like the whole of western Europe were flooded, North America was split in two by a sea.” Gunton said the fact that such extraordinary creatures as dinosaurs are no longer with us was sobering. “It reminds you of the fragility of the planet, that we hold on by our fingertips because mother nature is much more powerful. It also reminds you of the planet’s resilience. As one door shuts, evolutionarily, another opens,” he said.",News/Science,Attenborough series sinks teeth into fruits of ‘dinosaur revolution’,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/20/attenborough-series-sinks-teeth-into-fruits-of-dinosaur-revolution
5/20/2022,"The cost of decommissioning the UK’s seven ageing nuclear power stations has nearly doubled to £23.5bn and is likely to rise further, the public accounts committee has said. The soaring costs of safely decommissioning the advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs), including Dungeness B, Hunstanton B and Hinkley B, are being loaded on to the taxpayer, their report said. Failures in the government’s investment strategy for the fund, which was set up to pay for the decommissioning, have led to the taxpayer topping it up by an additional £10.7bn in just two years. The nuclear power stations are owned by EDF Energy and provide much of the UK’s nuclear power-generated electricity, which makes up 16% of the energy mix. But the stations are nearing the end of their lives and are scheduled to stop generating electricity during this decade. The government has recently agreed that once the stations have been defuelled by EDF, which involves the removal of all the spent fuel from the reactor core and cooling ponds, ownership of the stations will be transferred to the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to complete decommissioning. “The pace at which the stations can be defuelled could have a big impact on the costs, between £3.1bn and £8bn depending on the time taken,” the inquiry report said. “Successful defuelling will depend on all parties being ready and working together, including the NDA being ready to receive and dismantle the volume of fuel arriving at Sellafield. Any delays in the defuelling process could result in costs increasing substantially. “The handover agreement does not appear to sufficiently ‘incentivise cost efficiency and ensure a smooth transfer of defuelled stations to the NDA’.” The public accounts committee also said it had concerns over whether the NDA had the capacity to take on the seven AGR stations in addition to its other responsibilities, which includes decommissioning the older Magnox reactors. It will cost the UK taxpayer £132bn to decommission all the UK’s civil nuclear sites and the work will not be completed for another 120 years, according to latest estimates. Boris Johnson has pledged to build eight nuclear power stations in eight years. But the UK has no facility for permanently and safely storing the waste from past, present or future nuclear power stations. Most is currently stored at Sellafield, one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. Nuclear Waste Services, an arm of the government, is seeking a site to build a geological deposit facility deep underground for all the UK’s nuclear waste. MPs on the public accounts committee said in their report on Friday the government must learn lessons from the rising costs of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors and be clear how the decommissioning of proposed new nuclear stations would be funded. The seven stations were sold by the government to EDF in 2009, with the later agreement that the French company would remove the fuel from the stations when they closed, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority would take on the decommissioning of the sites. But the cost of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors that began to close last year, plus Sizewell B, has more than doubled from £12.6bn in 2004-05 to £23.5bn in 2020-21, the public accounts committee report said. “There remain significant uncertainties that will need to be managed to prevent further increases in costs and ease pressures on the fund,” the report said. “The cost of defuelling will depend on the stations not closing significantly earlier than planned and how quickly they can be defuelled once electricity generation ceases.” There was significant risk that the cost of decommissioning the seven AGRs would rise further, the report said. The public accounts committee, in a previous report, said the cost of decommissioning the older Magnox reactors – which were the first generation of UK nuclear stations – had increased by billions of pounds because of uncertainty over the condition of the sites and how to tackle the decommissioning. The PAC report said the closure of seven nuclear stations by 2028 would have a significant impact on energy production, but EDF has said there can be no extensions to the life of the reactors while the UK waits for new generating capacity to come online.",News/Environment,UK nuclear power stations’ decommissioning cost soars to £23.5bn,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost
5/20/2022,"Doncaster, Milton Keynes and Stanley in the Falkland Islands have been awarded city status, approved by the Queen, in a competition being held as part of the platinum jubilee celebrations, the Cabinet Office has announced. The eight winners of the 2022 Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours competition, also included Bangor in Northern Ireland, Colchester in England, Douglas on the Isle of Man, Dunfermline in Scotland and Wrexham in Wales. The competition for city status has taken place in each of the last three jubilee years, with previous winners including Lisburn and Newport (2002) and Chelmsford (2012). This time the contest was open for the first time to applications from crown dependencies and overseas territories and attracted almost 40 entries. In addition to demonstrating why their unique communities and distinct local identity was deserving of city status, applicants also had to highlight their royal associations and cultural heritage to a panel of eight officials. The MP Stephen Barclay, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said: “What was clear to me during the process of assessing each application was the pride that people felt for their communities, local cultural heritage and the royal family.” The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said city status was a “huge accolade”, adding: “This competition showcases the best of Britain and the overseas territories and will act as a lasting legacy of Her Majesty the Queen’s platinum jubilee.” Bangor (pop 61,000) in Northern Ireland was a key site for allied forces during the second world war, with supreme commander Dwight D Eisenhower giving a speech to 30,000 assembled troops there shortly before ships left for Normandy and the D-day invasion. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh visited Bangor Castle in 1961 before lunch at the Royal Ulster Yacht Club in the run-up to Prince Philip racing in the regatta. Previously, Edward VII had visited in 1903. Colchester (pop 122,000) is Britain’s first recorded settlement and its first capital, and for the past 165 years has been a garrison town. Firstsite, its contemporary art gallery, was named Art Fund museum of the year in 2021. Doncaster (population 110,000) highlighted that its “community spirit and resilience was demonstrated during the Doncaster floods in 2019 as the community rallied to provide relief”. Originally a Roman settlement, it is home to the St Leger, founded in 1776 and the oldest classic horse race in the world, regularly attended by royals since George IV. It has made three previous attempts for city status. Douglas (pop 27,000) has links to the royal family through the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which originated there, with George IV as first patron, and the Queen patron today. Its cultural highlights include the annual Manx Music Festival, dating from 1892, and the Isle of Man Film Festival, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Dunfermline’s (pop 56,000) most famous son is probably Andrew Carnegie, whose steel and industry helped build the US, and whose philanthropy started the world’s public library system, according to Dunfermline’s bid. Its royal links stretch back to the reign of Malcolm III, king of Scotland from 1058-1093, when he set up his court there. Milton Keynes (pop 223,000), a new town started in the Queen’s reign, is described in its bid as “the pinnacle of the national postwar planning movement”. Today it has 27 conservation areas, 50 scheduled monuments, 1,100 listed building and 270 pieces of public art. Stanley, in the Falklands, (pop 2,100) has been regularly visited by members of the royal family, including Prince William, who spent six weeks based there as a search and rescue helicopter pilot. This year marks 40 years since the Falklands conflict. Wrexham (pop 42,500) boasts the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, a Unesco world heritage site described as a “masterpiece of creative genius”. It is also home to Wrexham Football Club, established in 1864 and said to be the third oldest in the UK and with the world’s oldest international ground.

5/20/2022,"Amazon’s new series, Night Sky, is really three shows in one. It’s a love story about a devoted, ageing couple who are facing their last years together. It’s an intergalactic sci-fi mystery involving portals to other planets. And it’s an intercontinental thriller involving various secret societies with conflicting interests re: said portals. The first of these works really well. So well, in fact, that when the action moves away from the couple it’s hard not to resent it. Much of this is to do with the fact that the pair, retired school teacher Irene York and her carpenter husband Franklin, are played by Sissy Spacek and JK Simmons. Great separately, they are something special together in this. You can feel the Yorks’ whole half-century together from the moment they enter a scene. The actors bring their everything to understatement, evoking their enduring love, and the anxieties beginning to nibble round the edges as the tribulations and indignities of old age start to gather. The script is deft, catching the shorthand of long-time partners while never drifting into sentimentality, and in broader terms capturing the intimacy of small-town American life – with all the advantages and disadvantages that come with that, especially if you’ve never left. The Yorks still live in the family home that we see them – in flashback – move into and start making their own some time in the late 70s. As Irene’s mobility in the present day decreases after a bad fall and Franklin starts to suffer memory losses, they come under increasing pressure to sell the house and maybe even move into the local assisted living facility. “We always have new spaces opening up!” one of the staff tells Irene chirpily. It seems at first that they don’t want to leave because they have been guarding a secret. In their shed is the entrance to a tunnel that brings them out to a viewing station overlooking an unknown, desolately beautiful planet. They have visited it 856 times, according to Franklin, but never dared open the door that would allow them to step out on to it. But we also learn that it is the house where they raised their son, Michael, and maybe even where they lost him to suicide 20 years before. The portal and the peace they find there takes on new meaning as a refuge from grief. As Irene takes stock of the couple’s life together – and is increasingly drawn to seeing what’s on the other side of the door – we seem to be heading for a heartfelt allegorical tale that will allow Spacek and Simmons all the time and space they need to show us what talent and a half century of experience can really deliver. Unfortunately, the other two shows come crashing in. When Irene visits the viewing platform with the intention of heading into the great beyond, she finds a semi-conscious blood-covered man on the floor and brings him back to the house. The mysterious stranger – Jude (Chai Hansen) is soon up and prowling round the house and hacking pieces of futuristic technology out of his flesh so that he is free to embark on a personal quest without interference. Then we cut to what – for far too long – seems to be a totally separate sideplot in Argentina. Stella (Julieta Zylberberg) is living a reclusive life that baffles and frustrates her teenage daughter Toni (Rocío Hernández) until Stella lets her in on the family secret: she is guarding a portal, set in the church near their isolated home, to an alien galaxy. When a first-rate piece of nameless malevolence arrives in the shape of terrifying Polish actor Piotr Adamcyzk, a sprawling narrative involving divine prophesies, extraterrestrial jiggery-pokery and those warring secret societies begins and comes to form the larger part of the series. Despite this, it still feels constrained, never quite becoming the full-blooded X-Files-meets-Da-Vinci Code madness you want it to be and which might make up for the loss of the Yorks’ quieter but heartfelt and more compelling story. It’s as if the full fruition of each of the three storylines has been sacrificed to the other. Revelations are doggedly and obviously withheld to drag out the suspense, which just dissipates it. Such clear attempts at manipulation make the whole thing more of an exercise in frustration than anything else. Spacek and Simmons remain Night Sky’s shining stars. If they could be hived off and the Yorks given their own eight-hour, sci-fi- and conspiracy-free series simply to show us how they navigate the last decade or so of life before it winks out, that would be wonderful.

5/20/2022,"Artists and musicians are being handed keys to the heritage-listed registrar general’s building in Sydney’s CBD in an effort to spark a new creative hub in politician and lawyer-laden Macquarie Street. The temporary hub, near Hyde park and the courts, will invite arts institutions to rehearse, collaborate and create. There will also be a dedicated space where works from the Lismore Regional Gallery and the Richmond River Historical Society damaged during recent floods will be restored and repaired. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the new space – called RGB Creative – was the first step of what would be a “significant piece of work right along Macquarie Street”. “A lot of these buildings have been closed to the public. They should be open for the public to enjoy and appreciate and we don’t do enough with what we have,” he said. “I’d love to see a greater connection through the Domain into the urban part of our Sydney CBD. “It will take time but I believe by the end of this project, we will have a great cultural precinct here in Sydney.” The new spaces will be open until February 2023, while work progresses on a business case for a new New South Wales history museum in the same precinct. The independent MP for Sydney, Alex Greenwich, said he hoped the precinct could freshen up Macquarie Street, an area suffering from “too many lawyers and politicians”. The state government has been working with the City of Sydney on projects to entice people back to the city after two years of remote working and damage to cultural institutions due to lockdowns and Covid cancellations. RGB Creative brings together a dozen cultural organisations including the Sydney Writers’ Room, Sydney Youth Orchestra and Music in the Regions. Also in the new space is The House that Dan Built, a not-for-profit, female-focused arts association. Its founder and director, Danielle O’Keefe, said the space had allowed her and the team to begin their recovery. “We felt an overwhelming sense of relief that we were going to be able to invest in our practice again after two years of being isolated, that we were going to be able to intersect with other arts organisations,” she said. “The last two years have been diabolical and we are still really feeling the effects of Covid.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW arts minister, Ben Franklin, who is originally from the northern rivers, was happy to see the work being done to save collections damaged during recent flooding. “Through the work that’s happening in this building, we’re going to be able to bring those two [affected] centres back to life. We’re going to be able to bring back that beating heart once again of Lismore.”",News/Australia news,New arts hub opens in heritage building in Sydney’s Macquarie Street,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/new-arts-hub-opens-in-heritage-building-in-sydneys-macquarie-street
5/20/2022,"This patch of mud is out of place in the immaculate farmyard, but it’s deliberate. After a desiccatingly dry spring, the swallows need soft mud to build their nests. Slippery-sleek glossy darts, they flash down and fill their beaks. This year, Dad is experimenting with “double roofing” to help the swallow chicks. When a new roof was needed for a stable block, the replacement was fitted directly on top of the old one like a second skin. The sparrows already love it, flitting in the gap between the two. It should prevent the chicks overheating as they often do under corrugated iron roofs – when temperatures hit the 30s, the young have no choice but to bail out of their sauna nests, falling to the ground. With gaping yellow beaks, sometimes sightless, pink and barely feathered, they are helpless and vulnerable to predators or being trodden on by a horse. Sadly, not everyone welcomes our summer migrants, with retailers, councils and property developers often determined to keep them out. Three years ago, we fought our nearby Tesco supermarket until it allowed swallows to nest at their usual position. Happily, it has welcomed them ever since, with nest cups and signs explaining to customers. But it’s clearly not a company-wide approach. Last month, heavy with deja vu, I learned that once again a Tesco store had put nets up. While the house martins were making that formidable flight from sub-Saharan Africa, local people swung into action, and a petition reached 50,000 signatories. The nets were removed just in time for the return of these red-listed birds. And it isn’t just companies taking this legal but disgustingly immoral approach. Nearby, a gorgeous cart lodge, busy with swallows last year, has had secure garage doors fitted. Another site gone. I feel sick to think about it. Active nests cannot legally be disturbed, and of course summer migrants leave, but they remain site-loyal. Often, there just aren’t any suitable alternatives if they are faced with nets or doors. Our heralds of summer continue to decline. Each year, the swallows fill me with joy as I wonder at their beauty and almost impossible acrobatic elegance. We must do more.
