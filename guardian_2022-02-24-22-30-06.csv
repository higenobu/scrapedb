2/24/2022,"The cost of the Southeastern trains accounting scandal has now risen to more than £80m, the franchise’s former operator Go-Ahead has revealed. The government stripped the transport group of the right to run one of Britain’s biggest networks in September for a “serious breach of trust” after discovering that £25m of taxpayer’s money had been retained by the Southeastern franchise over five years from 2014.  After further investigation, the full amount owed to the Department for Transport has been established as £51.3m, with discrepancies dating back to 2006. Go-Ahead has also set aside a further £30m for an expected fine from the DfT, although the government has yet to confirm any penalty. Publishing its delayed full-year results for 2020-21, postponed for an audit after the scandal emerged, Go-Ahead also revealed it may have to pay the DfT another £21.3m related to the franchise, in a disputed profit share agreement. Go-Ahead said this was a quite separate commercial negotiation rather than any further “breach”. Go-Ahead commissioned what it described as an independent review, led by the chairs of the group and Southeastern co-owner Keolis, that found “serious errors had been made” over several years, and that “by failing to notify the DfT of certain overpayments or monies due to the DfT, LSER [London & South Eastern Railway] breached contractual obligations of good faith”. Investigations found £27m, rather than £25m as originally thought, was taken in the breaches first discovered at Southeastern, relating to overpayments for track access on HS1. Another £17.3m was wrongly pocketed by LSER in overpaid subsidy from the DfT between 2006 and 2020, which will be repaid with £7m interest. Go-Ahead’s new chief executive, Christian Schreyer, said “mistakes were made by the business”, adding that “a detailed independent report has been provided to the government and we are optimistic of reaching a settlement soon”. The group’s interim chief financial officer, Gordon Boyd, said Go-Ahead did not know if it was under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Schreyer said the firm’s own inquiries had gone beyond LSER, including the neighbouring Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, and governance would be overhauled across the group. He said: “We have deeply investigated also GTR [Govia Thameslink Railway] and not found any matters of concern.” He said Go-Ahead was in “constructive talks” with the DfT to continue running the GTR network when its deal expires at the end of March. Passenger groups said they would take legal action to stop Go-Ahead being awarded a further contract to continue running GTR. Bring Back British Rail and the Association of British Commuters accused the government of burying the report on the investigation into Southeastern’s alleged seven-year “serious breach of trust”. Go-Ahead has also suffered problems in its ventures in Europe, having to make provisions for £36m in wrongly understated losses in Germany, and a £76m loss in Norway where government support for Covid losses has been pared back and the new government has said private firms could not bid for rail contracts. Despite it all, Schreyer said that Go-Ahead was “in good shape”, as it reported increased operating profits of £115.5m for the year.",News/Business,Dramatic increase to £80m in cost of Southeastern train accounting scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/dramatic-increase-to-80m-in-cost-of-southeastern-train-accounting-scandal
2/24/2022,"The number of people being deported from the UK is at a record low while asylum applications have soared over the last year, according to Home Office data. Government statistics, which have measured irregular migration for the first time, also confirmed that 28,526 people arrived on small boats in 2021 – slightly higher than previous reports and a huge jump from the 8,466 who came in 2020.  Critics have claimed that the statistics make a mockery of Priti Patel’s claims that the government is getting a grip on the UK’s immigration and asylum system. Figures released on Thursday show that just 2,380 people were forcibly returned to another country in the year to September 2021, a 35% yearly drop and the lowest number on record. In 2004 the Home Office deported 21,425 people. They also showed that just 11 people had been deported since the asylum application rules were strengthened last year after Brexit to allow asylum claimants to be removed if they arrive from another “safe country”. Only 64 individuals were served with inadmissibility decisions, meaning the UK would not admit the asylum claim for consideration in the UK system, because another country was considered to be responsible for the claim. Meanwhile, there were 48,540 asylum applications in the UK in 2021, this is 63% more than the previous year. This is higher than at the peak of the European migration crisis in 2015-16, when there were 36,546 applications, and the highest number of applications since 2003. Seven in 10 of the 14,734 initial decisions on applications led to asylum being granted last year – the highest rate since 1990. That figure appears to challenge Patel’s claim before parliament that most people who travel to the UK in small boats are not genuine asylum seekers. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “It comes as no surprise that today’s Home Office statistics show that the UK, along with our European neighbours, has seen an increase in asylum applications in 2021. Where there is war, conflict and violence – there will be people desperately seeking safety.” “It is important to recognise that that seven out of 10 men, women and children arriving in the UK are found to be fleeing bloodshed and persecution, the likes of which is unfolding in Ukraine, and so are granted protection.” The Home Office-published statistics showed that 36,792 people were found to have entered the UK by irregular routes last year. This means that around 8,000 people are expected to have entered the UK by means other than by small boats such as in the back of lorries or shipping containers. According to the report, last year’s figure of people crossing in small boats compares with 8,466 people crossing in 2020, 1,843 in 2019 and 299 in 2018. November 2021 had the highest number of small boat arrivals in the last four years – 6,971 – and the number coming to the UK in each month of last year was higher than comparable periods in 2020. The statistics also show that two-thirds of the UK’s seasonal worker visa holders issued in 2021 went to Ukrainian workers, raising questions about the potential impact of conflict in Ukraine on recruitment to British farms. After Indian nationals, Ukrainians were the second most common nationality among people granted UK work visas in 2021, mostly as a result of the seasonal worker visa. Almost 20,000 seasonal worker visas were granted to Ukrainian nationals, 67% of the total. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: “Today’s data show how heavily UK farms have relied on Ukrainian workers in particular, raising the question whether this source of workers will be disrupted by unpredictable events in that region.” Responding to the figures, the immigration minister Kevin Foster said: “This government is fixing our country’s approach to illegal entry to the UK and asylum by making the tough decisions to end the overt exploitation of our laws and UK taxpayers. “We know there is no simple solution to this problem but our New Plan for Immigration will deliver the fair but firm system the British people have repeatedly voted for.”",News/UK news,Deportations from UK at record low as asylum applications soar,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/24/deportations-from-uk-at-record-low-as-asylum-applications-soar
2/24/2022,"There’s a crack from floor to ceiling in Birmingham’s Ikon gallery. Luckily, some workers are on the job fixing it. They’ve left a brush, a dustsheet and paint-spattered blue overalls while they get lunch. But is it really safe to hang Renaissance masterpieces by the 15th-century artist Carlo Crivelli in a space that’s in this much disarray? It’s OK. The museums that have lent their treasures can relax. This is a witty bit of trompe l’oeil by artist Susan Collis. I watched her draw the crack in just two strokes with a steady hand and eye that might have impressed Crivelli himself. She has also made the brush, whose little encrustations of muck are precious stones, and the sheet and coat whose stains are embroidered. It’s a good joke because Crivelli himself is a whiz with trompe l’oeil. His Virgin and Child with a kneeling Franciscan friar, lent by the Vatican Pinacoteca, no less, on the other side of the same wall, has a brilliantly realistic crack painted into the marble on which the Virgin rests her feet, a dark rotting bloom of entropy.  You don’t expect to see an art installation that flirts with chaos in the middle of a Renaissance exhibition. What do you expect? Hard work, perhaps. A heavy catalogue. This show does have a proper catalogue but everything else about it stands the conventions of old-master shows upside down. And that’s the way Crivelli would have wanted it, you feel. His sly sense of humour delights in undermining his own purportedly religious works. Across the top of the Vatican picture is a swag of apples, pears and shiny olives, with no symbolic purpose at all, apparently just there because he liked painting them. They are more real than the Virgin and Child: real enough to touch, to taste, it almost seems. Seeing a painting like this outside a museum or stately home, in a white space designed for new art, frees it. You look at it as if the artist were alive. And he is absolutely our contemporary, even though he died around 1494. Crivelli was a naughty man. He came from Venice but had to leave this mighty republic after sleeping with another man’s wife: he was thrown in jail for six months as an adulterer. Clearly the husband had enough status to make his life in Venice impossible, for when he got out of prison he headed south and made a career in small cities along the Adriatic coast. His sexuality gleams from the first painting here, a small picture of Mary Magdalene that gives her narrowed eyes and long sensuous fingers. She’s not in the least repentant. How did he get away with it? I suspect the exiled, sophisticated Venetian Crivelli saw his small-city clients as naive rubes who were too dumb to know he was mocking them. So long as they got the right number of saints and the requested quantity of gold leaf in their sacred commissions, they didn’t ask why the female saints were so eroticised or why he kept putting pieces of fruit everywhere. The exhibition takes its title from The Vision of the Blessed Gabriele, in which a local saint of the city Ancona prays fervently in the foreground with beady eyes of piety almost popping out of his head. Behind him is a rocky landscape receding to a view of Ancona by the sea. In the sky floats his golden vision of the Virgin. But above that hang Crivelli’s beloved fruits, out of scale, out of place – and just to stress their disruptive nature, they cast shadows on to the sky behind them. That is, this is just a painted sky, and the fruits hang in front of it. This is more than a bit of fun. Crivelli places an ironic question mark over his depiction of Gabriele’s vision. It’s just an icon for a church. The real world, in the shape of those fruits, is far more substantial, in Crivelli’s eyes. The trompe l’oeil games and that exuberant passion for a reality too big to be held in one picture or belief system go into joyous overload in his 1486 masterpiece The Annunciation, With Saint Emidius. We are on the streets of Ascoli Piceno, that is celebrating its freedom from Papal rule. It’s full of triumphal arches, pink loggias and marble decor. It is also full of gratuitous details: a peacock perches on a balustrade below two precariously balancing potted plants, while exquisitely painted objects on a shelf distract from the Virgin Mary praying. Even the doves gathering on a high perch, while perfectly justifiable as symbols of the holy spirit, look more natural than spiritual. And in the foreground, for no reason, are the fruit and veg. Crivelli is a dazzling and mercurial artist but he painted a lot. The National Gallery alone owns 25 works by him. This exhibition makes a virtue of its small venue by being astute and selective, showing the National’s best Crivellis – including the Vision and Annunciation – alongside choice treasures from the V&A and Vatican. One loan didn’t turn up due to Brexit and Covid, so they’ve incorporated the empty wall space into Collis’s witty, sympathetic installation.

2/24/2022,"The European court of justice has been advised that British nationals living on the continent do not keep the advantages of EU citizenship now the UK has left the bloc, in a blow to campaigners fighting to keep more of their rights after Brexit. Anthony Collins, an Irish advocate general at the court, said in an opinion published on Thursday that British nationals “who enjoyed the benefits of union citizenship do not retain those advantages following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU”.  The Luxembourg-based court is expected to issue a formal ruling on the case in June, which was brought on behalf of a retired civil servant, Alice Bouillieze, who has lived in south-west France for 37 years. It usually follows its advocates’ advice. “Of course it’s disappointing,” Bouilliez, 62, a former Foreign Office official, said. “There is still a chance that this advice will be modified or even reversed, but it is upsetting. The opinion does seem quite cut and dried.” Bouilliez had based her case on the loss of her voting rights in local and European elections, arguing that EU citizenship was a fundamental status that should not be withdrawn without consent when there were serious consequences for people’s rights. Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the estimated 1.3 million UK citizens legally resident in one of the EU’s 27 states at the end of the transition period are eligible for permanent residence, protecting their most basic rights. But the withdrawal agreement did not secure several rights that British nationals enjoyed as EU citizens, including the right to vote and stand in local and European elections and the right to live and work outside their EU country of residence. Julien Fouchet, a French lawyer representing Bouilliez, said he was “very disappointed” with the announcement but emphasised that in 25% of cases the court did not follow the preliminary opinions of its advocate general. “Our arguments were not heard,” Fouchet said. “The advocate considers nationality is the essential criterion, that residence does not count. He seems to think UK citizens can easily apply for dual nationality, but that is very far from always being the case.” He said the opinion was “over-simplified” and “a big step backwards for the European Union. I consider EU citizenship to be one of the most significant achievements of the union. Its loss entails considerable consequences.” Fouchet said he had hoped voting rights would have been retained, pointing out that Bouilliez, who he said could not apply for French citizenship because of her oath of allegiance to the Queen as a Foreign Office employee, was not able to vote in the Brexit referendum because she been out of the UK for more than 15 years. Collins argued in his opinion that EU citizenship was additional to, and did not replace, nationality conferred by member states, that British nationals ceased to be EU citizens after Brexit, and that the loss of citizenship rights was “one of the consequences of the sovereign decision of the UK to withdraw from the EU”.",News/Politics,"Britons living in EU can’t keep pre-Brexit rights, European court advised",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/britons-living-in-eu-cant-keep-pre-brexit-rights-european-court-advised
2/24/2022,"Conservative MPs have called for the UK to increase military aid to Ukraine, including the former cabinet minister David Davis, who said the UK should consider providing air support to the Ukrainian armed forces. Boris Johnson said western allies “will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy” – expected to be outlined to House of Commons at 5pm on Thursday.  But Davis said that even the most “ferocious sanctions … are no longer a deterrent, they are a punishment” and that the invasion of Ukraine meant Vladimir Putin had “effectively declared war on the west”. Davis tweeted: “Therefore if we do not provide military support, more than 40 million Ukrainians will go from living in a democracy to living under a brutal dictatorship. “It is far too late to get boots on the ground, but it is not too late to provide air support to the Ukrainian army, which may neutralise Putin’s overwhelming armoured superiority.” Davis said the air support should be confined to the airspace over Ukraine, and based on a request from Ukraine’s president, saying this “should be perfectly legal under almost any interpretation of international law”. He added: “There are no zero-risk options. If we do not act militarily, then Nato will be significantly weakened and we must fear for the safety of every state that borders Russia.” Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said a Nato division should have been stationed in Ukraine as a deterrent. Ukraine is not a Nato member, but has requested membership. “If Kyiv falls, history will ask why the west didn’t do more?” Ellwood told the BBC. “Six months ago I called for a division, a Nato division, to be moved into Ukraine. That is what Ukrainians were requesting, and that would have deterred this invasion. “That would have been enough to make Putin think twice. But we didn’t do that, we actually did the opposite. We declared that we would not send any Nato troops into Ukraine. We parked that away.” The former minister Stephen Hammond also called for the UK to consider using further military deterrent. “We must stand with Ukraine at this time of continental crisisand ensure Russian aggression does not go unpunished. We must work with our allies to impose tougher sanctions and a no-fly zone,” he said. Russia has significant advantages in air power: its total air force has 1,172 combat aircraft against Ukraine’s 124, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank. Ukraine has sought to modernise its military over the past year, receiving Javelin anti-tank missiles from the US, shorter range anti-tank weapons from the UK and a small number of TB2 drones from Turkey. However, the bulk of its equipment dates back to the Soviet era and will be familiar to Russian generals. Alicia Kearns, a Conservative MP and former senior communications officer at the Ministry of Defence, said Britain providing defensive support in Ukrainian airspace should be “on the table and under discussion”. She said this would not be a move taken lightly, as it could mean Russia “shooting British airmen and women out of the sky”. Kearns said the move would be contingent on “meaningful intelligence” suggesting it would “be effective” at curtailing the Russian advance. “We know that Putin has a lot of anti-aircraft ground-to-air missiles,” she said. “He might not have any qualms about taking out British troops. If we went in, it would have to be with other Nato allies – a great number. “The alternative is, of course, the UK could put anti-aircraft missiles in neighbouring countries, but that also runs the risk of taking us into overt war with Russia. Kearns added it was “too late to put boots on the ground” but that if Russian troops continued their advance on Kyiv, the UK should consider cyberstrikes on the Kremlin and state firms “within the week”. She also suggested Turkey should be encouraged to deny the Russian navy passage through the Bosphorus straits, a key access point between the Black Sea and Mediterranean. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said weak sanctions such as those announced on Monday “just encourage others to believe we are weak because we’re clearly not willing to do anything serious. “So what that did, I’m afraid, on Monday was it didn’t deter but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren’t wiling to do anything serious. “If we are going to do sanctions, as I say, we need to do them extremely hard and extremely early.”",News/World news,Conservative MPs urge increase in UK military aid for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/conservative-mps-urge-increase-uk-military-aid-ukraine-russia
2/24/2022,"Good morning. After weeks of threats and failed attempts at diplomacy, Vladimir Putin launched a broad Russian military offensive targeting Ukraine at around 5am Ukrainian time today. World leaders warn this invasion could spark the largest war in Europe since 1945.  Within minutes of Putin’s short televised address, in which he announced a “special military operation” to “demilitarize” and “denazify” Ukraine, the country was under attack from cruise and ballistic missiles, with explosions heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv. Though Putin said that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine, he added a chilling warning to other nations in his address: “To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside: if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history. All relevant decisions have been taken. I hope you hear me,” he said. The initial wave of strikes appeared to involve cruise missiles, artillery and airstrikes targeting Ukraine’s military infrastructure, airbases and border positions. The first casualties have been reported. At least eight people have been killed and nine were wounded by the Russian shelling. It’s unclear if any were civilians. Russian backed separatist rebels were reported to be attacking Ukrainian positions around the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk about two hours into the attack. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced martial law had been declared across the country in the immediate aftermath of the first wave of strikes. Western leaders have responded with fury to Russia’s actions, with Joe Biden accusing Putin of choosing a “premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering”. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” Biden said. With Europe dependent on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas supplies, concerns that Russia could use its gas supplies to hurt Europe are well founded. European gas prices have since jumped more than 40%, with the global stock market plunging against the backdrop of the invasion. Follow our business live blog for more updates. US and UK intelligence believe Russian-backed hackers are behind another insidious new strand of malware, raising more concerns of potential Russian cyber-attacks against Ukraine as Russia utilizes every tool at its disposal. As western leaders look to toughen up economic sanctions, however, they may find that a swift economic victory against Russia is unlikely. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, a small but growing number of Ukrainians are making plans to go back to their homeland to fight. “The reality is that no one except Ukrainians will defend Ukrainian land,” said Marta Mulyak.

Biden has interviewed at least three potential supreme court nominees – all Black women – and is expected to reveal his decision by the end of this month. The number of mothers dying during pregnancy, childbirth or the year after increased in the pandemic’s first year, continuing a decades-long trend that disproportionately affects Black people. In 2020, there were almost 24 deaths per 100,000 births in the US, while the rate was 20 per 100,000 in 2019. Meanwhile, among Black people, there were 55 maternal deaths per 100,000 births, almost triple the rate for white people. Before last night’s invasion, Putin had announced earlier this week that he was recognizing the independence of the two separatist regions of Ukraine, Luhansk and Donetsk, known collectively as Donbas. Their leaders, Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik, have seen their political profile rise in Russia in the days since, leaving little question for analysts over who was truly in control. “The Russian leadership coordinated everything and nothing was left to chance,” said the political analyst Konstantin Skorkin, a Luhansk native who focuses on the region.

2/24/2022,"More than 80 Florida manatees are currently in rehab centers across the US as officials and conservations work to rescue a population that has been hit hard by starvation. The data released by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and US Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday underscores the peril facing the manatees, and comes amid a major conservation effort that includes a feeding program distributing 3,000lb of lettuce daily at a site on the Florida coast.  Manatees are facing an uncertain future. Their preferred food, seagrass, has been depleted due to water pollution; since 2009, about 46,000 acres of natural seagrass has been destroyed. Last year saw a record 1,100 Florida manatee deaths , far exceeding the annual average and topping the previous record in 2013 of 830 deaths. The first two months of 2022 alone have already seen more than 300 deaths, and conservation groups have sued the federal government over the die off. Now, a massive feeding effort is underway to address this issue. In December, state environmental groups announced a feeding site at the Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest electric utility, putting up $700,000 for a “temporary field response station” to feed the manatees at its plant in Cape Canaveral on the east coast. That program has so far distributed about 63,000lb of donated lettuce to as many as 800 manatees at a time, according to the Associated Press. “The eyes of the world are on this,” said wildlife commission chair Rodney Barreto ahead of the project’s launch. “We’ve got to get it right.” The state government has funded $1.2m for treatment of the 82 starving manatees currently in rehab, and there are other organizations such as SeaWorld rescue program that are assisting with additional funds, according to the Independent. However, the measures are merely a “band-aid” to the bigger issue, Earthjustice, an environmental law organization said in December. Others have said that stopping seagrass depletion is fundamental to solving the problem. Florida state representative Randy Fine recently called out new legislation introduced by Tallahassee politicians that favors real estate developers over the starving manatee population, giving developers the option to pay and dredge up natural seagrass. Elizabeth Forsyth, an Earthjustice attorney, has called on the United States Environmental Protection Agency to urgently address the manatee die off before its too late. “If watching manatees starve isn’t the tipping point for the EPA to step in, I don’t know what is,” Forsyth said in a December statement.

2/24/2022,"In 1908, Robert Nathaniel Dett became the first African American to gain a bachelor of music degree at Oberlin College in Ohio. The Canadian-born Dett later studied at Harvard and in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, and he went on to become one of America’s most respected teachers, composers and conductors. In 1930, his choir performed for President Herbert Hoover on the White House lawn, and made a tour of Europe that included several concerts in London. In 1937, the premiere in Cincinnati of his “sacred cantata” The Ordering of Moses was broadcast nationwide by NBC, though the transmission was halted halfway through, supposedly because of “technical difficulties”; the real reasons have never satisfactorily been established.  Subsequent performances of the work have been few, and it has taken almost nine decades for The Ordering of Moses to reach the UK. The British premiere was given by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Joshua Weilerstein, with Nadine Benjamin, Chrystal E Williams, Rodrick Dixon and Eric Greene making up the quartet of soloists. Dett compiled the text of his cantata from the Old Testament, telling of the Israelites’ enslavement in Egypt, and how Moses was instructed by God to lead his people to freedom. It’s a vivid piece of musical storytelling, a sequence of impassioned solo arias and dramatic choral numbers, always underpinned by pungent orchestral colours that progress steadily from the dark despair of the opening, strikingly coloured by cello and bassoon, to the brassy exuberance of the final moments, when Moses and his sister Miriam lead the Israelites in a celebration of their freedom. The melodic shapes and cadences of spirituals permeate the music, and on Go Down Moses in particular, act almost like a leitmotif throughout. The choral models range from Elgar and Coleridge-Taylor, perhaps even to Walton’s Belshazzar’s Feast (first performed just three years before The Ordering), and one wonders whether Tippett knew of Dett’s work, though in A Child of Our Time he uses spirituals as “found objects” rather than as part of the musical fabric. The performance under Weilerstein, who had begun the concert with suitably rowdy performances of Charles Ives’s Variations on America, in William Schuman’s orchestration, and the Symphonic Dances from Bernstein’s West Side Story, was persuasive and the singing thrillingly committed, even if some of the words from the soloists were not as clear as they could have been. Surely it won’t be another 85 years before The Ordering of Moses is heard again on this side of the Atlantic.

2/24/2022,"Top of the list has to be Jill Scott. Sent to Everton on loan last season and to Aston Villa this season, it would be easy to think the the 35-year-old midfielder’s England days were numbered. Far from it. Against Spain’s Barcelona-heavy midfield Scott was instrumental. The Chelsea defender Jess Carter showed her versatility, operating as a centre-back and left-back across the three games, and performed well. Hannah Hampton’s clean sheet and assured debut against Spain will have helped her edge closer to the third goalkeeper spot. SW  Most notably, a quartet comprising two key partnerships. Millie Bright, Alex Greenwood, Leah Williamson and Keira Walsh were always going to be in the squad but all four strengthened their case for starting the biggest games. While Bright and the helpfully left-footed Greenwood formed an excellent central-defensive axis, Williamson and Walsh showed they can serve as a fairly formidable “double six” combo in Sarina Wiegman’s apparently preferred 4-2-3-1. It seems Williamson has completed her transition from defence to midfield anchor but she is able to seamlessly revert to the rearguard should Wiegman switch to three at the back mid-match. Meanwhile Scott has reminded everyone that she remains an integral part of the squad. LT No one performed particularly badly but a number struggled for minutes despite heavy rotation. Jordan Nobbs produced moments of brilliance against Spain but gave away possession a little too frequently and is struggling to find the form that made her nailed on to start for Arsenal before her ACL injury. Manchester United’s Katie Zelem did not play and is yet to build on her one cap. Meanwhile, Nikita Parris has not replicated her deadly Manchester City form at Arsenal or for England since a stint with Lyon. Steph Houghton is yet to play under Wiegman because of injury and City revealed on Thursday that she recently had achilles surgery and would “return to training in the near future”. Her chances have been dented by the performances of Bright, Williamson, Carter, Greenwood and Rachel Daly and, with Lotte Wubben-Moy a short-term absentee, the centre-back options look strong and difficult to break into. SW Injured internationals often joke that they become regarded as “better players” while sidelined but the opposite could, unfortunately, be true for Houghton. Even if she returns to the squad this summer, she seems unlikely to break up the Bright-Greenwood axis. Although it was good to see Houghton’s City teammate Lucy Bronze return at right-back after a lengthy injury layoff, a defender still to return to full match fitness emphasised that she is often better going forward than defending. Phil Neville experimented with Bronze in midfield with mixed results and Wiegman may wonder if she could be better as a wing-back. It sounds like heresy but is there a chance Bronze may not automatically start every game at the Euros? LT It is hard to take a huge amount from a series of tight friendlies. Germany had 12 key players missing owing to injury and Covid, and 12 of Canada’s squad play in the US, which is off-season. However, matches against three nations ranked in the top 10 have offered the clearest look at whether England can challenge the best. The answer? Yes they can and, more importantly, there are significant signs of growth. The defensive issues that blighted Neville’s tenure look as if they are being ironed out and the team are creating chances. That is a solid platform. SW Although the picture remains pretty opaque there was further evidence that England’s improvement under Wiegman is no illusion. But, despite playing their best football for a long time, they remain very much a work in progress and aren’t always great at seeing out games they should win. Moreover this promises to be an extremely strong Euros featuring particularly powerful opponents in Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and an improving Spain. The good news for the Lionesses is that Wiegman, having led the Netherlands to Euro 2017 glory and the final of the 2019 World Cup, is one of those adaptable coaches eminently capable of finding a way to win. And in Fran Kirby and Lauren Hemp England possess two outstanding attacking talents. LT England had scored goals aplenty under Wiegman before this competition – 53 in six games – but were wasteful in a number of those matches. Against tougher opposition the team need to be more clinical. Wiegman is yet to get the best out of the world-class creator Kirby and that could be critical in that regard. Playing wide against Germany the Chelsea forward struggled. It is a role she plays often at club level but as part of a much more dynamic front three who bounce off each other. Against Germany she provided the assist for Ellen White when she drifted more centrally and was most effective when later moved into that position behind White, with more of a free rein. SW Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate. The collective defensive focus is showing signs of considerable reassuring improvement from the latter days of Neville’s tenure when key players developed an unfortunate habit of switching off at vital moments but they need to maintain it. Meanwhile Wiegman will surely want to keep White, her most reliable goalscorer, swaddled in cotton wool. White’s understudies are infinitely less ruthless and far from convincing.

2/24/2022," Profession IT consultant Voting record Bill has predominantly voted Conservative, but describes himself as a “liberal Conservative” rather than “a hang-’em-high, shoot-’em Conservative”. In the referendum he voted leave Amuse bouche Bill has walked the glaciers of Mont Blanc Occupation Lecturer in mental health nursing Voting record Helen, originally from Sunderland, describes herself as “very left-leaning”. In the last general election she voted Labour. In the referendum she voted remain Amuse bouche In 2016 Helen went on – and won – Think Tank, a BBC quizshow Helen He told me he’d just got two rescue cats so I immediately warmed to him. I support a charity that rehabilitates disabled animals that have been hit by cars in places like Romania, brings them over here and makes little wheelchairs for them. Bill Helen is a far more generous person than I am; she’s just one of life’s good people. She does good stuff. Helen It was a veggie place – I had the veggie haggis, which was fab. He had hummus and olives, then the risotto. I’m vegetarian, and think it’s cruel to slaughter animals for meat when we don’t need it. Bill I enjoy meat. So long as the animal is well cared for, and killed humanely, then I’m fine eating it. Helen We had a conversation about battery hens. I think it’s appalling – all hens should be free to roam. Bill It would be better if hens were free range. But if you ban battery farming – which is obviously cheaper – you take away choice from poorer people, who then can’t afford so many eggs. As a liberal Conservative, I like choice. Helen I would ban hunting altogether. There’s something unhealthy about people getting dressed up and having rituals and killing something; it’s like some bizarre cult. Bill Hunting is part of controlling vermin, and animals that prey on farm animals. You want to control foxes, because they worry sheep and chickens. Helen We have built on land the animals used to run about on. There are urban foxes because we’ve taken their land away – they have nowhere else to go. Bill There is a balance in nature, and these activities are part of maintaining that balance in the most natural way. Helen I’m totally opposed to Trident. We need to take a pacifist stance. I’m a member of the Peace Pledge Union. This mutually assured destruction stuff we had in the 80s – “I’ve got more nuclear weapons than you, I can blow up the world six times, you can only blow it up three times” – they just need to listen and realise how ridiculous it is. Bill If I thought we had the choice not to have them, I wouldn’t. But if we withdraw from the debate we weaken the broadest thing we stand for, which is the western way of life. Not the Chinese way of life, not the Russian way of life – they are not democracies. If we had to defend our democracy I would rather have them than not have them. Trident is a necessary evil. Helen We talked about nuclear power, too. I know we can’t just close all the nuclear power stations overnight, but instead of building new ones we should put the money into renewables. I’ve got solar panels on my roof. Bill Great – but we live in Scotland where the sun goes down at 3.26 in the afternoon and doesn’t come up till 8.40 in the morning. Helen We are always going to have wind and waves – we need to develop a system where we can store that power. Bill I agreed that the real challenge is storage. I have invested in some companies that generate hydrogen from renewables for that very reason. Helen We had very little in common, but were respectful of each other. The food was good. He said he really enjoyed the meal. That’s how you get through to people: you don’t scream at them outside supermarkets, you take them for a veggie meal! Bill We live in completely different circles. Helen is far more virtuous than I am. But the easiest thing to do is to sit in your bunker and reinforce your already set beliefs. Don’t. Get out there and talk to people – it’s a vital part of human society, and better than throwing bricks.
