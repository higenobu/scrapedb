3/30/2022,"Ukrainian troops in Mariupol are smuggling weapons into the city to hold out against the Russian assault. They are also stealing weapons and ammunition off of Russian soldiers to resupply their stocks. There has been ""continuous heavy shelling"" in the port city since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Ukrainian troops in Mariupol are taking ammunition off of Russian troops and smuggling in weapons to resupply and hold out against the Russian assault. Western officials in a briefing to reporters Tuesday said there is evidence of Ukrainian troops in Mariupol smuggling weapons into encircled areas for reinforcement as additional Russian troops close in. ""Ukrainian forces, though remarkably adept at smuggling weapons into areas which are encircled, they are also largely being able to resupply their fighters by taking weapons, ammunition, off Russian soldiers in the city itself,"" Western officials told reporters in a briefing. The officials acknowledged the ""continuous heavy shelling"" in the city and ""significant infrastructure damage across Mariupol."" They added that it's a ""fool's errand"" to predict how long Mariupol might hold out, considering that many in the city are being starved and there is no drinkable water because of the Russian attacks. ""There will be a moment in time when Russian forces will decide they've done enough in Mariupol and then they will look to how they mount these operations moving to the north and trying to mount as part of this broader envelopment an operation,"" the officials said. ""It's clear the Russians will want to do that quickly,"" they continued. ""It's just a question of how soon they're able to overcome the resistance in Mariupol."" Russian forces have been mercilessly attacking Mariupol for weeks, targeting civilians, even after agreeing to allow innocent people to leave through civilian corridors.

3/30/2022,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — A woman accused of harassing Apple CEO Tim Cook with pleas for sex and other crude suggestions before showing up at his Silicon Valley home in a threatening manner last October agreed to stay way from him for the next three years under an agreement approved Tuesday. Julie Lee Choi consented to the deal negotiated with Apple during a appearance in Santa Clara County Superior Court. Cook, Apple's CEO for the past decade, wasn't present at the proceeding held in San Jose, California. Choi, 45, declined to comment after the hearing while angrily waving off two reporters taking her picture outside the courthouse. An Apple lawyer also declined to discuss the stipulation. The agreement requires Choi to refrain from coming within 200 yards of Cook during the next three years, and prohibits her from attempting to communicate with him through any electronic means, including on Twitter accounts or emails. If she violates the terms, Choi could face criminal charges and potentially imprisoned. The bizarre case traces back to late 2020 when Choi began emailing Cook begging him to have sex with her and attaching images of handguns that she insisted he had made her buy, according to evidence that Apple submitted to obtain a temporary restraining order against her in January. Those documents also revealed Choi had set up a series of bogus companies trying to connect her to Cook, sometimes listing an Apple office as the headquarters. “I can't live like this anymore,"" Choi wrote in one email to Cook sent from an iPhone. “I want sex with you, please, please."" Cook has publicly said he is a gay man, but even after Choi acknowledges knowing that, her entreaties to him continued. “Tim, we are destined for our lives."" Apple took legal action after Choi told him last September that she intended to apply to become his “roommate” at his condominium located in Palo Alto, California — not far from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. In October, Choi showed up outside Cook's home on two separate actions and warned she “could get violent,"" according to court documents. Then, in December, Choi told Cook she would forgive him for $500 million in cash. A few weeks after that, Apple sought its temporary restraining order in a request that contended Choi “may be armed"" and “intends to return to Apple's CEO residence or locate him otherwise in the near future."" Choi had been living in McLean, Virginia before she began shadowing Cook in Silicon Valley. Apple paid more than $630,000 for security measures designed to protect Cook last year, according a required company disclosure to shareholders.",U.S./Associated Press,Accused stalker of Apple CEO Tim Cook agrees to stay away,https://news.yahoo.com/accused-stalker-apple-ceo-tim-184830868.html
3/30/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -The Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine may consider joining Russia once it controls all of Ukraine's Donetsk region, its news outlet cited separatist leader Denis Pushilin as saying on Tuesday. ""As for joining the Russian Federation, as for the wish and aspiration, they have been clearly traced since 2014 - the desire to be in Russia,"" Pushilin was quoted by the Donetsk News Agency as saying. ""But now the main task is to reach the constitutional borders of the republic. Then we will determine that,"" he said. The comments come two days after the leader of the other Russian-backed eastern Ukrainian rebel region Luhansk said it may hold a referendum on joining Russia. Kyiv said any such vote would have no legal basis and would trigger a stronger international response. Three days before ordering the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin recognised the breakaway territories in Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states, though the rest of the world considers them part of Ukraine. Ukraine, which says it is fighting for its existence against what it casts as an imperial-style land grab by Russia, has repeatedly said it will never agree to Russia's annexation of its territory - the hardest part of peace talks with Moscow.
