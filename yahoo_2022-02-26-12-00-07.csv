Your wife is being hugely neglectful. Not to mention it’ll be warm soon and being left in a hot car even for a few minutes can be deadly. Not the asshole and I wouldn’t let her take him anywhere until she apologizes,"" they said (and over 28,500 people upvoted their comment, agreeing). ""I have a dear friend whose kid, when she was six, decided she wanted to go see grandma so she told her mom. Her mom said they could go later, but the kiddo wanted to go right away so she headed outside (on a really hot day) and got in the family minivan without telling anyone. She curled up on the back seat and fell asleep. Five minutes later the family was panicked looking for her, and 15 minutes later she was being rushed to a hospital and she's never been the same. She has major physical and cognitive deficits that will never heal. She's in physical and occupational therapy years later and — to this day — uses a power chair to move around. On top of all that, there was a police investigation and a CPS investigation to determine if there was negligence on behalf of the parents. They had to deal with the threat of their other kids being taken away while they were trying to stay in the hospital with their little one. Leaving kids or pets in a car, no matter what temperature it is outside, even for just a few minutes, it's no joke."" —u/knitmeapony ""I got an amber alert for this exact situation recently.

2/26/2022,"STORY: China's abstention comes just weeks after Beijing and Moscow declared a ""no limits"" partnership. The vote was delayed two hours for last minute negotiations by the United States and others to win the Chinese abstention, diplomats said. The Council softened the language in its resolution and dropped parts of it, including a reference to 'the president'. The United Arab Emirates and India also abstained from the vote on the U.S.-drafted text, while the remaining 11 council members voted in favor. Russia is a U.N. Security Council veto power, along with the United States, China, France and Britain. ""We are united behind Ukraine and its people, despite a reckless, irresponsible permanent member of the Security Council abusing its power to attack its neighbor and subvert the U.N. and our international system,"" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after Russia cast its veto. The draft Security Council resolution demanded that Russia ""immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine"", withdraw all its military forces and reverse its recognition of two separatist states in eastern Ukraine as independent. The draft resolution is now expected to be taken up by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly.",Politics/Reuters Videos,'You cannot veto our voices': U.S. envoy on Russia's U.N. veto,https://news.yahoo.com/cannot-veto-voices-u-envoy-024211597.html
