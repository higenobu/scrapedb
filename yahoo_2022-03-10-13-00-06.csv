3/10/2022,"By Josh Smith and Hyonhee Shin SEOUL (Reuters) -Conservative South Korean opposition candidate Yoon Suk-yeol rode to victory in a tight presidential election on a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars, reshaping the political future of Asia's fourth-largest economy. His victory in Wednesday's bitterly fought election marks a remarkable turnaround for the main conservative bloc, now known as the People Power Party, which has regrouped since the 2017 snap election was held after the impeachment and ouster of then President Park Geun-hye. Yoon is a former prosecutor-general involved with Park's case who fell out with outgoing President Moon Jae-in after being appointed by him, gaining notoriety over investigations of top presidential aides. Yoon has pledged to stamp out graft, foster justice and create a more level economic playing field, while seeking a ""reset"" with China and a tougher stance towards reclusive North Korea, which has launched a record number of missiles in recent months. He faces the challenge of uniting a country of 52 million riven by gender and generational divisions, growing inequality and surging home prices. ""Real estate prices, housing policy, jobs, and tax policies will top his domestic agenda,"" said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based expert with the Center for a New American Security. Yoon will need to restore public trust in Korea’s institutions and is likely to conduct major ""housecleaning"" by following through on a campaign pledge to investigate Moon's administration for corruption, she added. Yoon, 60, edged out the ruling centre-left Democratic Party's Lee Jae-myung to replace Moon, whose single five-year term ends in May. A formal announcement is expected to be made later on Thursday. Yoon's lack of elected political experience was seen as both a liability and an asset. While his campaign was marked by gaffes and controversy, the race became a referendum on Moon's economic policies from jobs to housing to wealth inequality. ""I would pay attention to people's livelihoods, provide warm welfare services to the needy, and make utmost efforts so that our country serves as a proud, responsible member of the international community and the free world,"" Yoon said at a victory ceremony with supporters. The benchmark KOSPI rose more than 2%, its sharpest daily rise in at least three months, with Yoon expected to speed deregulation in South Korea's capital markets. The election was one of the closest in recent history and came after an unusually bitter campaign marred by scandals and smears. Both candidates' disapproval ratings matched their popularity as scandals, mud-slinging and gaffes dominated what was dubbed the ""unlikeable election"". CONFRONTING CRISIS Lee's loss casts doubt on Moon's legacy, including his signature efforts to engage with North Korea, which have largely been stalled since talks fell apart in 2019. The new president will likely face an almost immediate crisis with Pyongyang, which appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite and has suggested it could resume testing of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons for the first time since 2017. Yoon has vowed to forge even closer ties with the United States - South Korea's only treaty ally - in the face of increased missile activity by North Korea and competition with China, which is the South's largest trading partner. The White House congratulated Yoon, saying President Joe Biden looked forward to working closely with him to bolster the alliance. Yoon and Biden spoke by telephone on Thursday, the White House later added. ""We can expect the alliance to run more smoothly and be in sync for the most part on North Korea, China, and regional and global issues,"" said Kim from the Center for a New American Security. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida welcomed Yoon's win, and said he hoped to work closely with him to rebuild healthier ties with its neighbour amid tensions over historic and economic disputes dating to Japan's 1910-1945 occupation of Korea. More than 77% of South Korea's 44 million eligible voters cast ballots to pick their next leader, despite an record surge in new COVID-19 cases this week. Yoon said he would work with opposition parties to heal polarised politics and foster unity. ""Our competition is over for now,"" he said in an acceptance speech, thanking and consoling Lee and other rivals. ""We have to join hands and unite into one for the people and the country."" At a separate ceremony with supporters, Yoon said he would put top priority on ""national unity,"" adding all people should be treated equally regardless of their regional, political and socioeconomic differences. Lee had conceded defeat and congratulated his opponent. ""I did my best, but failed to live up to your expectations,"" he told a news conference, blaming his ""shortcomings"".

3/10/2022,"PIERRE — South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg is unfit to hold the office given his conduct related to a fatal crash in 2020, according to Public Safety Secretary Craig Price. Price on Wednesday issued a formal letter urging a legislative committee vetting impeachment of the attorney general to consider all the facts before resolving its work this spring. ""The attorney general's actions through the investigation, the findings from our review of the crash events, along with the context provided by the pre- and post-crash behaviors draw the conclusion that he is unfit to hold the position as the chief law enforcement officer for the state of South Dakota,"" Price said in a letter sent to House Speaker Spencer Gosch, the Glenham Republican overseeing the House Select Committee on Investigation. The letter attempts to walk Gosch through a series of facts revealed throughout the committee's monthslong process of determining whether Ravnsborg should be removed from office. It also provided new information regarding correspondence between Ravnsborg and others in text messages that Price characterized as disparaging and out of character with the high standards expected of law enforcement officers. The letter alleges that forensic investigators discovered text messages between Ravnsborg and members of his staff that were ""disparaging and offensive statements regarding other law enforcement officers, judges, a Supreme Court justice, a legislator, prosecutors, staff members, a former attorney general, and a United States senator."" More: Prosecutors say they couldn't prove AG Jason Ravnsborg knew he'd struck human on night of crash And less than 48 hours after the death of the crash victim, 55-year-old Joe Boever, Ravnsborg received a text message from someone identified in the letter as a political consultant that insensitively referred to Boever's political affiliations. ""Well, at least the guy was a Democrat,"" read the text message, according to Price's letter. The investigation file Price refers to in the letter has never been made public. Price and Gov. Kristi Noem have previously shared their opinion that Ravnsborg should've faced felony charges following the Sept. 12, 2020 crash. But prosecutors chose to charge him with three misdemeanor traffic violations instead, saying they were unable to prove that Ravnsborg left the crash scene with knowledge that he'd struck Boever. Ravnsborg reported in the initial 911 call that he didn't know what he'd struck while driving near Highmore in the night time hours. Boever's body was not discovered until the following morning. The House Select Committee on Investigation is set to meet next Thursday. A privately-paid spokesman for Ravnsborg did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening. Following receipt of the letter, Gosch told the Argus Leader he sees the move as the latest example of Noem and her administration ""meddling"" in the committee's work. And that a press release publicized Price's letter seeks to put political pressure on the committee, he said. ""We're having conversations right now about whether or not we can even proceed at this point,"" Gosch said while questioning whether the entire process has been tainted by the governor's involvement, which he characterized as ""perverted."" The family of Joe Boever told the Argus Leader that while disturbing, the revelations about disparaging text messages does not come as a surprise. Nick Nemec, a cousin of Boever who serves a spokesperson for Boever's widow and mother, said in the days following the crash, the family received notification that Ravnsborg and his allies were attempting to cast Boever in a negative light. And in the lead up to the litigation stemming from the case, Ravnsborg's attorney prepared to argue that Boever suffered from mental health and addiction issues. ""So it doesn’t surprise me — the smart ass remarks about Joe Boever,"" Nemec said. This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

3/10/2022,"Vladimir Lisin said in a letter to steelworkers he hoped Putin could find a diplomatic resolution. The steel tycoon wrote that the death of people in Ukraine is a tragedy that it is ""impossible to justify."" Lisin is the 81st richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. Russian oligarch Vladimir Lisin has called for a peaceful resolution to the attack on Ukraine. Lisin, the chairman and main shareholder of one of the largest steelmakers in Russia, sent a letter along with the board of directors to his staff at Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK) saying that he was hopeful that the war could end soon and calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a diplomatic outcome. Reuters first reported the letter. An NLMK spokesperson confirmed the letter with Insider. ""I would like to begin by expressing my deepest compassion to all the victims of the armed conflict in Ukraine, the families and relatives of those who died,"" Lisin wrote. ""Lost lives are always a huge tragedy that is impossible to justify. I am convinced that peaceful diplomatic conflict resolution is always preferable to the use of force."" Lisin is one of Russia's richest men and is the 81st richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. The steel tycoon is currently worth about $19.1 billion in US dollars. His wealth is down over $5 billion since Russia began invading Ukraine, according to the index. Thus far, the Russian billionaire has been able to avoid sanctions, but the UK is eyeing sanctions on his 3,000-acre 17th-century Aberuchill Castle in Scotland, according to a report from BBC. The oligarch is one of a handful of Russian billionaires to speak out against the invasion into Ukraine. Last week, Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska spoke out in protest of the attack, calling for peaceful negotiations between the two countries. Russia's wealthiest have not been immune to the impact of sanctions from Western countries. Sanctions targeting Russia's economy and financial systems have cut into their net worth. Meanwhile, the US, Canada, and European nations have also moved to take direct aim at the Russian oligarchs by seizing their Western assets. One day after the invasion of Ukraine, Russia's 22 richest individuals lost a combined $39 billion. Since then, Russia's currency has plummeted to historic lows and brought the nation to the brink of default.
