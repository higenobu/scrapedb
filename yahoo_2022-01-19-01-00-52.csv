1/19/2022,"Let’s talk about quality stocks. Of course, this is the direction that every investor wants to go; but the question is, how to recognize them? Do we go all-in on the big-value, big-name giants? Or do we dig a little deeper, and find the high-end nuggets that are hiding in the sandheap? Weighing in from investment bank Morgan Stanley, chief investment officer Lisa Shalett recommends the latter. She recommends investors to look for beaten-down stocks, equities that have lost value recently – but that retain their fundamental soundness, and are ‘likely to beat profit forecasts.’ In her view, this is where the market value lies. She bases her stance on some curious facts of the market structure right now: “If you look underneath the surface of the indices, 85% to 90% of the stocks in the market have actually corrected from 52-week highs, and many have corrected as much as 10% or 20%. We think that this is an opportunistic stock-picker’s market.” Following up on Shalett’s advice, the stock analysts from Morgan Stanley are doing the stock picking. They found several stocks with 40% or better upside potential – and, interestingly, all are down at least 20% from their recent peak values. After running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, it’s clear the rest of the Street is in agreement, with each earning a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Smartsheet (SMAR) We’ll start with Smartsheet, a software company offering a set of cloud-based workspace management and collaboration products through the popular as-a-Service subscription model. The company’s products can handle a wide range of tasks, including admin, content collaboration, resource management, online forms, custom email domains, integrations, multiple views – it’s a long list. Smartsheet got its start in 2006, and has since come to be relied on by 80% of the Fortune 500 companies. Getting to the numbers that investors want to follow, in its most recent quarter (Q3 or fiscal 2022, reported in December), Smartsheet showed 46% year-over-year revenue growth, to $144.6 million. Drilling down a bit, subscription revenue came in at $132.6 million, matching the overall 46% growth, while professional services rose 50% yoy to reach $12 million. Despite the positive results, and an upbeat outlook for the full fiscal year, Smartsheet’s stock is down 23% from its recent high point, reached in September last year. Covering Smartsheet for Morgan Stanley, 5-star analyst Stan Zlotsky says simply, “We are bullish on Smartsheet’s ability to achieve $1B of revenue in FY24 and sustain 30% growth into FY25. Both results are ahead of our estimates…” Zlotsky goes on to elaborate, pointing out Smartsheet’s smart move into the government vertical: “Smartsheet began investing in their government and international segments before the pandemic began, and we are starting to see green shoots of those efforts. On the government side, Smartsheet’s early mover advantage towards FedRAMP certification has been important to winning new logos. Considering the efforts across all levels of government to automate more of their processes, and Smartsheet’s ease in solving those challenges, we see this vertical becoming a more meaningful driver of growth moving forward, especially as the early adopters from last year begin to scale usage and become reference customers.” All of the above makes it clear why Zlotsky is now standing with the bulls. The 5-star analyst rates SMAR an Overweight (i.e. Buy) while his $105 price target implies an upside of 67% for the year ahead. (To watch Zlotsky’s track record, click here) ""We remain OW SMAR and see it as one of our top three ideas into 2022,"" Zlotsky summed up. Overall, there are 11 recent analyst reviews on record for Smartsheet, and they include 9 Buys against just 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus view. The shares are selling for $62.70 and their $91.45 average price target implies an upside of ~46% for the coming year. (See SMAR stock forecast on TipRanks) Endava, Ltd. (DAVA) For the next stock we’ll look at Endava. This company offers tech services, including digital advisory, IT strategies, business analysis, program management, digital product strategy, machine learning and AI, product design, and UX – and all of that is only part of their service list. London-based Endava got its start in 2000, and serves enterprise customers in the retail, healthcare, and consumer product sectors across Europe, North America, and Latin America. This company’s stock has been both strong and weak recently. For its strength, DAVA is up 65% year-over-year, and both revenues and earnings are on a rising trend. On the weak side, shares have fallen recently, and the stock is down 23% from its late-December peak. That slide coincides with the lower-magnitude slips in the major indexes. Endava has seen five consecutive quarters of sequential gains in revenue and earnings, and the most recent report, for Q1 of fiscal 2022, showed a top line of 147.5 million GBP, or US$201 million. EPS came in at 67 cents US. These results were up 55% and 88% year-over-year (growth rate adjusted for constant currency). The company caught the attention of Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette, rated 5-star rating by TipRanks, who saw fit to upgrade his stance on Endava, raising his view from Neutral to Overweight (i.e. Buy). Faucette writes, “Demand for cloud-related projects continues to be robust, as companies look to execute on digital transformation initiatives. DAVA's 100% digital engineering exposure with nearshore development teams have driven new client additions and expansion of small proof-of-concept engagements, allowing for increased spend at larger clients... Similar to other pure-play peers, competitive supply dynamics has allowed for pricing power and the ability for DAVA to be selective in the engagements it chooses to pursue. Taken together, we see DAVA as a core beneficiary of secular digital transformation themes.” Everything that DAVA has going for it prompted Faucette to rate the stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy). The cherry on top? His $185 price target implies ~43% upside from current levels. (To watch Faucette’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts also like what they’re seeing. 3 Buys and a single Hold add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The $185.50 average target is practically the same as Faucette's objective. (See DAVA stock forecast on TipRanks) EPAM Systems (EPAM) Last but not least is EPAM, a custom software and consulting company, offering a combination of innovation, out-of-the-box design thinking, and physical-digital capabilities for truly unique solutions. The company boasts a customer base exceeding 280 Forbes Global 2000 companies, in more than 40 countries – and also boasts a work force of more than 52,000 sharp minds to bring to bear on customer needs. EPAM is based in both the US and Belarus, became a public entity in 2012, and exceeded $2.6 billion in annual revenue in 2020. The company has kept up its solid financial performance. Revenues have shown a distinct rising trend, with 4 quarters in a row of sequential gains. In the last reported, 3Q21, EPAM showed $988.5 million in total revenue, up ~52% year-over-year. Earnings have also been rising, although with a bit more volatility in the results. EPS has shown sequential gains in the last two quarters reported, with the 3Q21 result coming in at $2.42, or a 46% increase from 3Q20. Looking ahead to the 2021 full year results, EPAM expects 40% full-year revenue growth. While’s EPAM’s shares are up 56% year-over-year, the stock peaked in early November, and is down 24% from that level. For a deeper look at EPAM’s prospects, we can check in again with Morgan Stanley’s James Faucette, who writes, “The company’s robust recruiting framework allows the company to recruit highly skilled engineering talent in nearshore geographies, driving revenue per employee of approximately $70k, a meaningful premium to more diversified IT Services peers with legacy exposure. Quality of EPAM’s delivery and execution, as well as the scarcity of established pure-play digital IT Services providers, underpin the company’s ability to drive consistent 20%+ revenue growth, which should allow the company to double its revenue approximately every three years. Its 85% exposure to time-and-material-based contract structures allow it to pass on wage inflation to end customers, particularly given the scarcity of highly-skilled engineering talent.” To this end, Faucette gives EPAM stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a price target of $830. If everything goes as planned, EPAM will soar about 53% over the next 12 months. Wall Street is clearly interested in EPAM, as shown by the 9 analyst reviews the stock has picked up in recent weeks. These break down to 8 Buys and 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus, and have an average price target of $788 suggesting an upside of 45% from the current share price of $543.06.

1/19/2022,"Microsoft buys Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard for $69bn Glaxo courts Qatar and Singapore to head off £50bn Unilever swoop FTSE 100 slides after jobs data; Brent oil hits seven-year high Ambrose Evans-Pritchard: France's nuclear meltdown has big implications for Britain Sign up here for our daily business briefing newsletter Oil has extended gains to hit the highest level in seven years as omicron fears eased and geopolitical tensions returned in the Middle East. Brent crude climbed past $87 a barrel for the first time since 2014, while West Texas Intermediate also rose above $85 for the first time since October. Prices have climbed since the start of the year as demand remained high despite the impact of the omicron variant. Adding to the pressure, Yemen’s Houthi fighters claimed to have launched a drone strike on the United Arab Emirates – the third biggest Opec producer – that caused an explosion and fire on the outskirts of the capital Abu Dhabi. There could be good news for anyone hoping to spend less time at work for the same pay, as British companies gear up for a trial of a four-day week. The six-month pilot, which will begin in June, will allow staff to work 32 hours per week while leaving their compensation and benefits unchanged. Companies may ask staff to spread the 32 hours over five days, however. Around 30 firms have signed up so far for the trial, which will focus on productivity, as well as other factors such as workers' wellbeing and the programme's effect on the environment and gender equality. Joe Ryle, director of the Four Day Week Campaign, told Bloomberg: ""Moving to a four-day week would be a win-win for companies. ""Studies have shown that productivity improves along with corresponding gains in workers' wellbeing."" Soros Fund Management and the Winklevoss twins’ venture capital firm have thrown their weight behind Animoca Brands, a non-fungible token and metaverse company. They were among the investors in a new funding round that's more than doubled Animoca's valuation to $5bn (£3.7bn). The $359m funding round, led by existing backer Liberty City Ventures, is more than it raised in the whole of 2021. Hong Kong-based Animoca offers NFTs and games tied to blockchain platforms – both its own creations and collaborations with outside brands – spanning mobile devices, home consoles and the web. It's confirmed: Together Energy has become the 27th UK energy supplier to go bust since August. Regulator Ofgem said the company, which is half-owned by Warrington Borough Council, has ceased trading. It follows the Telegraph's report earlier this afternoon that Together Energy was on the brink of collapse. Together Energy supplies around 176,000 domestic customers. Read more: Council-backed energy supplier on the brink of going bust Ikea says it's on track to become climate positive by 2030 after the flatpack furniture giant cut its carbon emissions by 6pc from pre-pandemic levels. Parent company Inter Ikea said emissions in the value chain – from raw material production to customers' use and disposal of products – dropped in 2021 compared to 2019, when emissions fell for the first time. Compared to 2020, when stores were shuttered during the pandemic, emissions rose 6pc. While emissions from raw materials kept growing, Ikea said the reduction in its carbon footprint came mainly from the use of more renewable energy across operations, and a larger share of sales of more energy efficient light bulbs and plant based food. It came as the Swedish retailer's sales hit a record €41.9bn (£35bn) in 2021 despite global supply chain disruptions as consumers spent more on their homes. New from Rachel Millard: A council-backed energy supplier is set to become the latest to collapse due to soaring wholesale gas costs. Ofgem, the regulator, is seeking rivals to take on Together Energy’s customers under its supplier of last resort process for failed companies, the Telegraph understands. Clydebank-based Together Energy, which has 170,000 customers, is half-owned by Warrington Borough Council. Ofgem is understood to have approached suppliers about taking on customers from three providers - Together and two smaller operators - that have either ceased trading or are expected to fail soon. The supplier of last resort process is designed to ensure customers are not left without energy when a company collapses. Together Energy is set to be the 27th supplier to fold since August, affecting almost 4m customers. ​Read Rachel's story here Natural gas prices have fluctuated today as investors grapple with a slew of issues roiling the market. Norwegian supply has dropped to its lowest since September, but shipments of liquefied natural gas on cargo ships has helped to ease the crisis. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Russia to take steps to de-escalate the situation on the Ukraine border, raising hopes that a military conflict will be avoided. However, he warned Germany could halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia did attack its neighbour. This kept trading volatile, with benchmark gas prices surging as much as 10pc before swinging between gains and losses. While it's good news for Activision, the sentiment is rather less positive elsewhere on Wall Street. US stocks continued their decline as markets opened, with tech firms proving a major drag as bond yields surge. Banks were also in decline following Goldman Sachs' disappointing fourth-quarter numbers. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 1.5pc, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones were down 1pc and 1.1pc respectively. Shares in Activision have leapt by almost a third after it revealed a £50bn takeover by Microsoft. The shares surged as news of the takeover emerged, before shares were halted pending a formal announcement. Meanwhile, shares in Microsoft dipped 1.8pc. The merger, which is the largest tech deal in history, is the latest example of consolidation in the booming video game market. Last week Take-Two Interactive, which makes Grand Theft Auto, agreed a $12.7bn deal to buy FarmVille maker Zynga. Microsoft is buying video game giant Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn (£50.5bn) in its biggest ever deal. The US tech giant will pay $95 per share in cash for Activision, which is behind hit titles including Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. The deal will help Microsoft expand its own offerings for its Xbox console and pile pressure on rival Sony's PlayStation. The two firms already have a history of partnerships, with most of Activision's games published on Xbox. Microsoft said the takeover will ""accelerate the growth in Microsoft's gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud and will provide building blocks for the metaverse"". It comes as Activision battles controversy amid several lawsuits that allege gender discrimination and harassment. Chief executive Bobby Kotick, who has led the firm for three decades, has come under pressure from employees to resign. The scandal has taken a toll on Activision, which saw its shares plunge in November after it delayed the release of two major titles and said fourth-quarter sales would miss expectations. Microsoft said Mr Kotick will continue to lead Activision, which will report to Phil Spencer, who heads Microsoft Gaming. The chief executive of the world’s biggest money manager has denied claims his firm is “woke”, while warning that companies rolling back flexible working patterns after the pandemic “do so at their peril”. Simon Foy has more: Larry Fink of BlackRock used his annual letter to chief executives to deny accusations his firm has pushed a progressive political agenda, arguing that investors should focus on wider societal issues such as climate change. “Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke’. It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper. This is the power of capitalism.” Mr Fink also called on governments to provide guidance on sustainability policy and regulation because companies “can’t be the climate police. When we harness the power of both the public and private sectors, we can achieve truly incredible things.” ​Read Simon's full story here The EU's commissioner for financial services said she will propose extending a temporary waiver that allows its banks and money managers to clear trades in the UK to June 2025. The bloc has been pushing for more financial activity to move to the continent but both British and European banks, investment managers and hedge funds have called on the Commission to extend their access, warning of significant market disruption. The extension to the current waiver, due to expire in June, marks a post-Brexit victory for London, highlighting the critical role it plays in Europe's financial infrastructure. But Ms McGuinness reinforced the EU’s desire to bring more clearing inside the bloc’s borders to strengthen its own markets. Shares in Goldman Sachs dropped in pre-market trading as a fall in fourth-quarter profit took the shine off its record year. The Wall Street behemoth reported net profit of $3.8bn (£2.8bn) in the last three months of the year – down from $4.4bn last year and below expectations. The decline reflected weaker trading activity as a more stable economy resulted in less volatility on financial markets. However, Goldman reported a 45pc rise in investment banking revenue to $3.8bn in the quarter. Dealmakers raked in record revenues from advising on some of the world's biggest mergers and IPOs. Shares in Goldman Sachs fell 2.8pc ahead of markets opening. Toyota has said it's unlikely to reach its target of manufacturing 9m cars in the current financial year as chip shortages continue to hammer the industry. The world's largest car maker is cutting production to 700,000 vehicles in February – around 150,000 units lower than its original goal for the month. It didn't set a new annual target, saying only that output would be lower than expected. Toyota had already slashed its annual production outlook in September as Covid lockdowns in Southeast Asia disrupted its ability to procure key parts from the region. It's the latest car brand to warn on the impact of semiconductor shortages, which have showed signs of worsening in recent weeks. US stocks are poised for a sluggish open this afternoon as Treasury yields surged and expectations rose that central banks will have to lift interest rates sooner than expected. Treasuries fell across the curve, pushing two-year and 10-year yields up to levels last seen before the pandemic roiled markets. The change in course is particularly damaging for tech stocks, whose valuations are pinned on future growth expectations. Futures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq led losses, falling 1.9pc. The S&P 500 fell 1.2pc, while the Dow Jones was down 0.8pc. My colleague Ben Woods has more on the 5G crisis facing airlines: US airlines have warned of looming travel chaos as 5G mobile networks due to go live on Wednesday threaten to cause significant disruption across America. The chief executives of its biggest carriers have called for immediate action to halt the upgrade to prevent large numbers of planes being “indefinitely grounded”. A letter signed by 10 airlines including United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta called on the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigeg, to create a two-mile exclusion zone around airport runways to prevent upheaval for passengers, freight, supply chains and vaccine distribution. United said 5G would cause disruption affecting 1.25m passengers and 15,000 flights a year if the mobile operators are allowed to turn on the 5G signals. Mobile giants Verizon and AT&T are poised to press the button after a series of delays due to fears the C-Band wireless spectrum could interfere with aircraft equipment. They had vowed to carry out the upgrade regardless before bowing to pressure from US authorities to delay it until January 19. ​Read Ben's full story here 888 has posted a rise in revenues for 2021 as lockdown fuelled demand for online casinos. The London-listed firm, which is based in Gibraltar, said sales were up 14pc to $972m (£714m) year on year. It was also helped by growth in the US as a number of states continue to relax their gambling laws. However, 888 suffered a slowdown in the final three months of the year, which it blamed on strong comparable figures in 2020. Shares slipped 2.3pc in morning trading. It comes after the company agreed to buy William Hill's international arm for £2.2bn, handing it control of about 1,400 high street sites. The deal is expected to complete in the second quarter of this year. The Government has launched a crackdown on misleading cryptocurrency adverts amid concerns consumers don't fully understand what they're buying. Crypto ads have become increasingly common in recent months, with billboards flooding the London Tube network. But the Treasury is planning to regulate the market like other financial products and ensure promotions and ""fair, clear and not misleading"". It comes amid growing scrutiny of the notoriously volatile asset type. The FCA has issued frequent warnings about digital assets, with chair Charles Randell taking aim at an Instagram ad posted by Kim Kardashian. Spain yesterday made a similar announcement following clashes with celebrities including footballer Andres Iniesta. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said: Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest – but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims. We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market. Passenger services on London's new Elizabeth Line will start in the first half of 2022, Transport for London has confirmed. Initial services will run between Abbey Wood and Paddington stations, with the outer reaches of the line to Shenfield and Reading not opening until a later date. The Crossrail project was originally due to open in full in 2018, with a budget of £14.8bn. But a string of problems means it's now heavily delayed and the cost has ballooned to an estimated £18.9bn. . @TfL says that @Crossrail passengers services WILL commence in the first half of 2022, with initial services between Abbey Wood and Paddington Elizabeth line stations. pic.twitter.com/CBgPu5535Q — Richard Clinnick (@Clinnick1) January 18, 2022 Usually, at this time of the year, the world's business and political elite would be ensconced in the snowy luxury of Davos. But Covid has got in the way once again, so the great and the good will have to settle for Zoom as they chew the fat about some of the biggest issues facing the world today. Among the items up for debate at this year's World Economic Forum are the race to net zero, cyber resilience, strengthening global supply chains and bridging the vaccine manufacturing gap. London-based venture capital firm Blossom is eyeing investments in the cryptocurrency market after raising £316m in its latest funding round. Bosses said they plan to invest a third of the latest cash injection into crypto firms as it moves more and more into the mainstream. The VC's previous bets include Checkout.com, which is now the UK's most valuable fintech firm, and crypto infrastructure provider Moonpay. Managing partner Ophelia Brown, who previously worked for VC giant Index Ventures, said she has secured funding from some of the biggest US universities and endowments. She added: ""They share our conviction that early-stage capital can have outsized impact on the trajectory of a company. ""With this new fund, we are continuing with our high-conviction strategy of providing foundational capital to entrepreneurs."" Sterling has drifted lower against the dollar following data showing employers added record numbers of employees in December, though a squeeze on wages looms. Payrolls added 184,000 workers while unemployment fell – moves that could fuel expectations of another Bank of England interest rate rise. But wages were stagnant in real terms as inflation surged, which could reassure dovish policymakers. Sterling has rallied more than 4pc from its December lows, but a further interest rate rise is now largely priced in. The pound fell 0.3pc against the dollar to $1.3614. Against the euro, it slipped 0.07pc to 83.62p. Confidence among German investors has jumped to its highest level since July on hopes for a strong recovery once the current wave of omicron infections passes. The ZEW institute’s gauge of expectations jumped to 51.7 in January from 29.9 the previous month. An index of current conditions, however, dropped to a eight-month low of -10.2, reflecting tighter virus restrictions and curbs on activity. ZEW president Achim Wambach said: “The economic outlook has improved considerably with the start of the new year. The main reason for this is the assumption that the incidence of Covid-19 cases will fall significantly by early summer. ” German GDP shrank in the fourth quarter as omicron hit. It's likely to contract again in the first three months of the year, putting Europe's economy on track for its second recession of the pandemic. But investors are hoping the recovery will get back on track in the spring, while the Bundesbank is forecasting growth of 4.2pc for 2022 as a whole. I worry that ZEW panellists may be getting a bit ahead of themselves with the sharp bounce in expectations on reduced Omicron worries. But taken at face value, the January composite PMI may surprise to the upside. pic.twitter.com/bDfDGMnb7i — Oliver Rakau (@OliverRakau) January 18, 2022 Patrick Cescau, chairman of InterContinental Hotels Group, is retiring after nine years in the role. Mr Cescau, who previously served as chief executive of Unilever, will step down on 31 August, the company said. He will be replaced by Deanna Oppenheimer, who is currently chair of Hargreaves Lansdown. The leadership change comes as IHG, which owns the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn chains, begins to stage a recovery from a pandemic-induced slump. Ms Oppenheimer is an experience City figure. She sits on the board of Thompson Reuters and has held senior roles at Premier Inn owner Whitbread, Tesco and Barclays. Keith Barr, chief executive of IHG, said: I would like to thank Patrick for his counsel and support during his tenure as chair. His dedication and stewardship has left the company in a strong position for high-quality future growth and I am certain the wealth of experience Deanna will bring to the IHG board will make her an excellent successor. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is considering a further expansion of charges for petrol and diesel vehicles in the capital as he ramps up efforts to tackle climate change. One proposal would replace the existing system with a daily fee of up to £2 for all motorists driving a polluting vehicle in London. The Mayor is also considering expanding the current ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) across all 33 London boroughs. A third option would include both the Ulez expansion and the so-called clean air charge. Mr Khan is also considering controversial plans that would charge motorists from outside London around £3.50 per day for travelling into the city. The Mayor is aiming to pick one of the proposals – which are likely to face backlash from motorists and businesses — before his second term ends in May 2024. The owner of Motor Fuel Group (MFG) is said to have kicked off a sale process that could value the petrol forecourt operator at £5bn. MFG, which is owned by private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), has invited investment banks to pitch for a role selling the company, Sky News reports. The petrol station group, which has around 900 sites across the UK, has focused on the shift to electrification – a move that could make it appeal to infrastructure investors or oil companies. According to the report, a listing of MFG is also possible, but less likely than a sale. Chocolate lovers went nuts for nuts over Christmas, shunning novelty options in favour of nutty alternatives. That's according to the boss of Hotel Chocolat, who said hazelnuts, pistachios, peanut butter and pecan-based chocolates were all the rage over the festive period. Customers also upgraded to bigger boxes of treats as families celebrated, while novelty chocolates suffered. Overall, Hotel Chocolat reported a 37pc rise in sales in the 13 weeks to Boxing Day compared to last year. Chief executive Angus Thirlwell told PA the company saw a shift from store to online sales as the omicron variant spread throughout the country in December but sales held up strongly. Investor confidence in UK economic growth has taken a bit of a beating as inflation and a squeeze on incomes rattles markets. There's been a 2pc drop in confidence in the last month, according to a survey by Hargreaves Lansdown, likely reflecting the surge in prices and a looming cost of living crisis. Still, optimism about UK assets has grown, with investor confidence up 4pc from November amid expectations that heavyweight FTSE stocks in the mining, energy and financial sectors could begin to pay off. The only area to suffer a fall in confidence was North America, which fell 3pc. This is likely due to worries about the fate of highly valued tech firms in a higher interest rate environment. Meanwhile, the number of investors who expect interest rate rises in the next six months has fallen back slightly to 78pc, compared to 83pc in November, though the majority still expect another move soon. EU car sales crashed to a new low last year as the pandemic and global chip shortages took their toll. Car registrations dropped 22pc in December to 950,218 vehicles, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. New car sales fell 1.5pc in 2021 as a whole, marking the worst showing since the body started tracking the market in the early 1990s. Despite hopes the semiconductor shortage would ease, manufacturers' expectations have in fact deteriorated, with troubles expected to linger in 2022. Germany – the continent's biggest car maker and home to BMW and VW – led the decline with a 27pc slump in December, making in the only major country to suffer an annual decline. Oil has extended its gains to hit its highest level in seven years as omicron fears eased and geopolitical tensions returned in the Middle East. Brent crude climbed past $87 a barrel for the first time since 2014 while West Texas Intermediate also rose above $85 for the first time since October. Prices have climbed since the start of the year as demand remained high despite the impact of the omicron variant. Adding to the pressure, Yemen’s Houthi fighters claimed to have launched a drone strike on the United Arab Emirates – the third biggest Opec producer – that caused an explosion and fire on the outskirts of the capital Abu Dhabi. Goldman Sachs is now expecting Brent to hit $100 in the third quarter. The biggest market mover this morning is Just Group, which has gained as much as 8.4pc on the back of a strong trading update. The insurer, which specialises in retirement products and services, reported a 25pc increase in sales to £2.7bn. The firm said new business profits grew by a low double-digit percentage. Just Group also doubled underlying organic cash generation, exceeding its 2022 target a year early. Analysts said this should have a positive impact for the resumption of dividends. Shares in Hugo Boss tumbled as much as 3.6pc as investors turned their focus to omicron troubles – even as the brand beat sales estimates. The German fashion house reported fourth-quarter sales of €906m (£757m), ahead of expectations of €861m. Earnings also beat forecasts at €100m. Hugo Boss reported faster sales growth in all regions, with particular strength in Europe and the Americas. But analysts warned of a slowdown in growth in 2022 given the potential disruption from omicron in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, Rio Tinto's latest production numbers have left investors a little disappointed. The mining giant forecast weaker-than-expected iron ore shipments this year, blaming labour shortages and delays at a major project in Australia. The world's biggest iron ore producer said it expects to ship between 320m and 335m tonnes in 2022 from the Pilbara region in Western Australia. Last year's shipments were down 3pc. Rio Tinto said it had suffered from the delay in production from the new greenfields mine at Gudai-Darri as well as labour shortages in the region. The FTSE 100 firm said it was ""encouraged"" by growth prospects for the coming year, though it warned of potential disruption from rising Covid cases and geopolitical tensions. Shares fell 0.4pc following the update. Shares in The Hut Group tumbled in early trading after warning its full year profit margin would miss expectations. The embattled online retailer said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin would come in between 7.4pc and 7.7pc – below the 7.9pc expected – due to adverse foreign currency movements. Shares dropped more than 7pc. Still, THG recorded its highest ever annual sales of £2.2bn, which it pinned on ""significant"" growth over the festive period. It said the new year had ""started well"" but flagged challenges ahead as it comes up against tough comparisons from a year earlier, when the UK was in lockdown, as well as record commodity prices and the knock-on effect on its nutrition division. After a strong start to the week, the FTSE has eased off as investors digest the latest employment data. The blue-chip index is down 0.7pc, with mining stocks such as Rio Tinto proving the biggest drag. Consumer-focused firms Diageo and British American Tobacco also fell. It comes after ONS stats show payrolls rose in December and unemployment fell. However, vacancies rose to a record high as more people exited the workforce. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 dropped just shy of 1pc. Insurer Just Group bucked the trend, rising as much as 8pc after reporting 25pc growth in sales. Airlines have called on the Biden administration to delay the rollout of 5G near airports amid fears it could spark thousands of flight cancellations and global disruption. Industry body Airlines for America warned of ""catastrophic disruption"" if the new frequencies were put into service within two miles of where aircraft fly in the US. Airlines are worried the signals could interfere with instruments that measure an aircraft’s altitude and have warned the rollout could hold back the industry's recovery from the pandemic. The letter signed by airline bosses, seen by Politico, reads: “Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies.” It echoes calls by Airbus and Boeing to delay the switching on of so-called C-band frequencies, which officials are worried are enough to those used by altimeters to cause interference and make the readings unreliable. Frequencies used in other countries are less likely to cause disruption, according to the FAA. British authorities have said there's no evidence that 5G networks in the UK pose any risk to aircraft.

Under the proposals, energy suppliers would receive payments from the Government when wholesale gas prices exceeded a certain threshold so they would not then have to pass the increase on to household bills, the Financial Times reports. Suppliers are backing the move, with some arguing it would be self-funding in the long run, as companies would have to return the money when wholesale prices fell back below a certain level. Government insiders reportedly view the plans as “plausible” and “logical”, though admit there are some downsides. A final bit of reaction now from the Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors: The good news is that the unemployment rate is now back to within a whisker of its pre-pandemic level but the same cannot be said for the number of people actually employed. The reason for this difference is an increase in the number of people who say they are not available for work – in fact, the legacy of the pandemic appears to be this rise in economic inactivity. Today’s data shows inactivity is particularly pronounced in people over the age of 50 with, sadly, a rise in long-term sickness in this group the driving factor. It is also now becoming clear that the Office of Budget Responsibility’s forecast that the unemployment rate would be 4.8pc by the end of 2022 is way off the mark. We expect it to be running at under 4pc in the not-too-distant future. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, says capacity constraint will impact the economic recovery. The strength of the UK jobs market remains remarkable by any historic comparison, as vacancies rise and unemployment drops. It’s clear that temporary and part-time work is playing a key role as people find new roles in different sectors as the economy changes rapidly. More short-term and part-time roles may also reflect greater flexibility from firms as they struggle to hire in this market. The big issue now is capacity constraint – there are hundreds of thousands fewer workers in the labour market than before the pandemic. Over time, that will affect the economy’s ability to drive prosperity. Firms need to be looking at new approaches to developing their workforce, while Government needs to work with businesses on the skills and job matching support necessary to address rising economic inactivity. Staff shortages will outlive the pandemic as an economic issue – recruiters are well placed to support businesses in this market with the latest insight and advice. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, says labour supply is struggling to keep up with demand. The labour market appears to have remained tight both after the end of the furlough scheme and the start of the omicron wave, which supports our view that interest rates will be raised from 0.25pc to 0.50pc on 3 February. The more timely data suggest that it won’t be long before Labour Force Survey employment is rising again. Indeed, demand for labour remained strong as omicron struck. In December, PAYE employees rose by 184,000 and the claimant count fell by 43,300. Strong demand for labour and limited supply pushed up the number of vacancies to a record high of 1.247m in the three months to December. That said, the single-month data show that vacancies fell in both November and December, which could be an early sign that job shortages are easing. Overall, these data suggest that labour demand has remained fairly strong, that supply is struggling to keep up and that the squeeze on households real wages is only just beginning. The FTSE 100 has fallen back at the open as it takes a breather following Monday's gains. The blue-chip index fell 0.3pc to 7,588 points. Another concerning point is vacancies, which soared to a new record high of 1.25m. This came alongside another increase in the number of people leaving the workforce. Inactivity in the quarter rose to 8.78m – an increase of 66,000. There were also 459,000 fewer people in work than at the end of 2019, before the pandemic. The shortfall is driven in particular by fewer older people in the labour market, with more people out of work due to long-term ill health. It explains why vacancies are rising and companies are struggling to fill jobs, even as unemployment falls. It also poses a threat to the economic recovery, with staff shortages holding back businesses. However, inflation seems determined to crash the party. Regular pay (excluding bonuses) increased 3.8pc over the three-month period. That's down from 4.3pc growth in the previous quarter. Including bonuses, pay was up 4.2pc, down from 4.9pc growth. To put that into context, annual inflation in November stood at a decade-high of 5.1pc. In October, house prices rose 10.2pc, according to the ONS. So the numbers suggest the squeeze on living standards is likely to intensify, as pay growth struggles to keep up with inflation. Let's focus on the positive numbers in the latest jobs release. First, company payrolls rose 184,000 in December – that's stronger growth than was expected. Also, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1pc in the quarter to the end of November, marking the best reading since June 2020. These figures will be taken as positive signs of the economic recovery and suggest the labour market was in rude health despite the outbreak of omicron. The numbers are also likely to bolster the argument for further interest rate increases by the Bank of England, which meets to make its decision next month. Good morning.  Fresh figures from the ONS this morning give a mixed picture of the labour market. While jobs numbers strengthened – payrolls increased by 184,000 in December and the unemployment rate fell to 4.1pc between September and November – there are worries about a looming cost of living crisis. A surge in inflation meant wage growth was wiped out in real terms over the three-month period. What's more, in November, pay fell 1pc in real terms. Job vacancies also hit a record high of 1.25m, highlighting the skills shortage facing businesses. 1) Start-up plans driverless deliveries for Ocado and Asda this year Wayve raises $200m from investors including Sir Richard Branson 2) Nicola Sturgeon reaps £700m from auction to triple UK's offshore wind power Shell, BP and Scottish Power want to build more floating and fixed turbines but face opposition from fishermen and conservationists 3) Antonio Horta-Osorio could pocket £3.8m on way out of Credit Suisse Former Lloyds boss is replaced over trip to Wimbledon in breach of Covid rules 4) Sadiq Khan threatens to take Boris buses off London's roads in funding row Boris Johnson's fleet of New Routemasters in jeopardy as TfL seeks further Government financing 5) Online car auction site threatens ‘dinosaur’ rivals High-end buyers raced to snap up new toys on the Collecting Cars website, often without even viewing them first With Wall Street closed, Asian markets recovered slightly from Monday's travails as investors took some of their lead from Europe.
