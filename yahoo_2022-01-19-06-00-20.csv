1/19/2022,"By Tom Hals WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shareholders urged a judge on Tuesday to find Elon Musk coerced the company's board into a 2016 deal for SolarCity and asked that the chief executive be ordered to pay the electric vehicle company one of the largest judgments ever of $13 billion. ""This case has always been about whether the acquisition of SolarCity was a rescue from financial distress, a bailout, orchestrated by Elon Musk,"" Randy Baron, an attorney for shareholders, told the Zoom hearing. The closing arguments recounted key findings from a 10-day trial in July when Musk spent two days on the stand defending the deal. The lawsuit by union pension funds and asset managers alleges that Musk strong-armed the Tesla board into approving the deal for the cash-strapped SolarCity, in which Musk was the top shareholder. Musk has countered that the deal was part of a decade-old master plan to create a vertically integrated company that would transform energy generation and consumption with SolarCity's roof panels and Tesla's cars and batteries. Evan Chesler, one of the lawyers representing Musk, told the hearing that the deal was not a bailout and SolarCity was far from insolvent and its finances resembled many high-growth tech companies. ""They were building billions of dollars of long-term value,"" Chesler said of SolarCity. The all-stock deal was valued at $2.6 billion in 2016, but since that time Tesla's stock has soared. Shareholder attorney Lee Rudy urged Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware's Court of Chancery to order Musk return the Tesla stock he received, which would be worth around $13 billion at its current price. Musk said in court papers such an award would be at least five times the largest award ever in a comparable shareholder lawsuit and called it a ""windfall"" for plaintiffs. Rudy said Slights should consider Musk's contempt for the deposition and trial process, in which he repeatedly clashed with and insulted shareholder attorneys. ""It would be a windfall for Elon Musk if he got to keep shares he never should have gotten in the first place,"" Rudy said. Chesler called the request to order Musk to return the stock from the deal ""preposterous"" and said it ignored five years of unprecedented success at Tesla. Tesla's stock was down 1% at around $1,040 in afternoon trade. Tesla acquired SolarCity as the electric vehicle maker was approaching the launch of its Model 3, a mass-market sedan that was critical to its strategy. Shareholders allege the deal was a needless distraction and burdened Tesla with SolarCity's financial woes and debt. Shareholders claim that despite owning only 22% of Tesla, Musk was a controlling shareholder due to his ties to board members and domineering style. If plaintiffs can prove this, it increases the likelihood that the court will conclude the deal was unfair to shareholders. Musk's lawyers said the celebrity entrepreneur had no power to fire directors or control their pay and he recused himself from price negotiations on the SolarCity deal. ""Without Elon Musk, Tesla might not exist let alone have a $1 trillion value,"" said Vanessa Lavely, an attorney for Musk. ""That doesn't make him a controller. That makes him a highly effective CEO."" Slights ended the hearing by saying he expects to rule in about three months. He said last week he intends to retire in the coming months and a related shareholder lawsuit challenging Musk's record pay package was transferred from Slights to another judge.

1/19/2022,"Over 36 million families got their sixth—and final—monthly child tax credit advance back in December. Those checks were a temporary measure that was provided by the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that President Joe Biden signed into law in March 2021. For one year, the economic aid package upped the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,000 per dependent ages 6 to 17, and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children age 5 or younger. Unlike previous years, up to half of that money could come early through monthly $250 or $300 tax advances (a.k.a. checks) sent between July and December. Eligible parents who received the monthly advances will still get up to half the total credit once they file their 2021 tax return this year. But what will replace the lapsing benefit? As of right now, the 2022 child tax credit (which you would get when you file in 2023) is set to go back to $2,000 for each dependent age 17 or younger. The benefit is set to revert because Congress didn't pass an extension of the enhanced benefit, nor an extension of the monthly payments. That said, the IRS has yet to release the income cutoffs for the 2022 benefit. Not to mention, there's still a chance Congress could act before the child tax credit reverts back to its pre-2021 payment level. Democratic leadership continues to push to pass the Build Back Better plan—a reconciliation bill they've been working on for over six months. In its latest form, the bill would extend the 2021 child tax credit for another year. However, moderate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) remains opposed to both the size of the bill and the idea of extending the monthly child tax payments. Passing a reconciliation bill in the face of united Republican opposition would require the support of every Democratic senator. After all, Democrats hold the 50-50 split chamber only through a tie-breaking vote from the vice president. So without Manchin's support, Democratic leadership is unlikely to pass the bill. Before publicly coming out against the bill, Manchin reportedly told the White House he would support the continuation of the monthly child tax credit payments only if it included a ""work requirement"" for parents and capped payments to families with an income under $60,000. If Manchin got his $60,000 income cap, millions of Americans would lose out on the benefit. The enhanced child tax credits ($3,000 for children ages 6 to 17, and $3,600 for children age 5 or younger) went out this year to single filers whose modified adjusted gross income was less than $75,000 per year and couples filing jointly who earned up to $150,0000. Earners above that could still get a $2,000 credit; however, they were completely phased out at an income of over $200,000 per single filer and over $400,000 per household.
