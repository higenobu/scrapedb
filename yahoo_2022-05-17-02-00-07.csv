5/17/2022,"A group of med school students is going viral after sharing how much debt the individuals be in when they graduate. The insight comes courtesy of a student named William (@will_ill), who often posts on TikTok about his life in med school. Many of Willam’s videos have gone viral before, but his latest post — about the debt he and his fellow students will face in a few short years — has drawn over 3 million views. Bitcoin ETFs: What are they and how to invest in them? His video is earning praise for its transparency but also leaving many users blown away by just how expensive med school can be. It’s also just the latest in a recent series of viral TikToks about everyday student issues. In one recent clip, a historian revealed why history degrees aren’t as “useless” as some students think. In another, several med school students shared how many times they had to apply to their programs. William’s video offered a similarly personal look at college life. “We’re so broke it’s actually insane,” the TikToker captioned his post. Many of William’s classmates were lighthearted and nonchalant when sharing their massive debt totals. That said, the amounts themselves were fairly jarring for viewers. The lowest amount given by any of William’s classmates was $150,000. Meanwhile, some said they would owe $300,000 or even $400,000 when they graduate. NBA and NFL star stylist Dex Robinson's must-haves for a night out with the fellas: Those numbers, it turns out, are fairly normal. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the median debt of a med school student in 2019 was $200,000. That high number is partly explained by the fact that the average public four-year medical school costs over $250,000 per student, while the average private school costs over $330,000. TikTokers couldn’t believe William’s video, or his classmates’ attitudes about their debt. “How are y’all so casual about it?” one user wrote. “I’d be in constant crippling anxiety if I even had debt.” “Med school should be free,” another argued. “Salaries have been totally squeezed and they have a massively delayed earnings start.” “Every day i remember again why i am so happy i decided not to stick with pre-med,” another wrote.

5/17/2022,"During a recent Fox News appearance, Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH) slammed Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) for presenting a text message he forwarded to former President Trump’s Chief of Staff Mark Meadows “in a false way to the American people.” The text Jordan referenced was one of the thousands of text messages sent to Meadows that was released by the select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Jordan went on to say that the committee is “recording colleagues” and “lying to people” because it is driven by “animosity towards President Trump.” The Ohio congressman and fierce supporter of the former president stated that President Trump was the best president of our lifetime and did what he said he would do. Jordan is one of several GOP lawmakers recently subpoenaed by the January 6 panel. The panel believes Jordan and others have relevant information regarding the attack and the events leading up to it. He said he has yet to see the subpoena and will look at it, but is concerned about how the committee operates. The committee engages in “crazy activities,” he said.",Politics/The Recount,Rep.

5/17/2022,"David M. Benett/Dave Benett /Getty Images Zara Phythian in 2016 Zara Phythian, the martial arts stuntperson and actress who appeared in 2016's Doctor Strange, has been sentenced to eight years of prison after being found guilty of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. According to the Nottingham Post, BBC News and U.K.'s The Times, the 37-year-old was sentenced in the U.K.'s Nottingham Crown Court on Monday, while her husband Victor Marke was sentenced to 14 years in prison, as Judge Mark Watson said Marke, 59, was a ""driving force behind the abuse."" ""Whilst you denied in cross-examination that you were besotted with Victor Marke, on the evidence I have heard I am in no doubt that your deviance was shaped by the influence that he had upon you from an early age,"" Watson told Phythian, per BBC News. Phythian was convicted on Wednesday of 14 charges of sexual activity with a child between 2005 and 2008, starting when the girl was 13 years old. In addition to the same 14 counts, Marke was found guilty of an additional four counts of indecent assault against another girl from 2002 to 2003, when she was 15. According to the BBC, a police interview with the first victim was played last month at Nottingham Crown Court, in which she said, ""I knew it was wrong, but I just didn't know how to get out of the situation or say anything."" Reps for Phythian and Marke did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment. Phythian and Mark have reportedly denied all allegations from both plaintiffs before being found guilty. The first victim described looking up to Phythian, who was working as a martial-arts instructor in Nottinghamshire at the time, as was Marke. She claimed Phythian and Marke gave her alcohol before Phythian dared her to perform oral sex on Marke, who reportedly was not yet married to Phythian but to another woman. ""I remember trying to copy Zara's reaction at the time because I looked up to her and tried to be like her,"" the woman said, according to BBC News. She said Marke then had sex with both Phythian and the victim.

According to The Nottingham Post, the second victim said Marke began having sex with her when she was 16. ""I want to thank the two victims who have showed great courage in coming forward and talking about their ordeal,"" senior investigating officer Parminder Dhillon said after the verdict, the Nottingham Post reported. ""Although no punishment handed down by a court can undo the lifelong damage caused to the them, I do hope they take some degree of comfort from the knowledge that justice has now been done."" Dhillon added, ""I hope this case serves as a reminder to others — that we treat all allegations of sexual abuse with the utmost seriousness and that, even in cases where offenses occurred many years ago, we will thoroughly investigate and we will do everything in our power to bring perpetrators to justice.""
