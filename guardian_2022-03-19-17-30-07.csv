3/19/2022,"Having just run down a posh lip balm sample in three weeks flat, leaving its plastic canister fit only for recycling, I’m wondering how much longer brands can excuse their selling of non-reusable lipsticks, and how we as consumers can justify our decision to buy cheaper single-use ones over only initially costlier refillables. Because truly, we’re spoiled for choice. Rihanna’s commitment to refillable beauty (much of her Fenty skin line already uses a snap-in refill pod system) has now extended to lip colour, with the launch of Icon, 10 new, creamy, semi-matte lipstick bullets that click in and out of a metallic hexagonal case (they’re £28 for a complete lipstick, £18 a refill thereafter). The formula is moisturising, packed with bold pigment (even the neutrals – Pose Queen is a rich, expensive-looking caramel; Scholar Sista makes rose seem less of a cop-out) and reasonably long-lasting. When one has been swiped to the nub, out comes the tiny plastic cartridge for recycling and in goes the fresh stick. There’s nothing particularly revolutionary about refillable lipsticks, of course (props to Guerlain, which was doggedly selling its heirloom-worthy Rouge G bullets and luxury cases years before forever lipsticks were cool). But the adoption of refillables by major players such as Rihanna may well prove influential to brands yet to bite. Before Rihanna was Hourglass, whose all-vegan refillable Confession lipsticks are still among the best designed. If you like to keep a whole wardrobe of shades in constant rotation, these are your best bet, since the individually covered refills (£22) snap in and out so quickly and neatly as to become interchangeable. You’ll probably need never buy more than one case (£35 for the whole thing). Christian Dior’s first-ever lipstick was refillable, but like everything else, lasting quality made way for disposables for several decades and only recently has Dior rejoined the long game. Rouge Dior (pictured) comes in 75 shades and four finishes, and the everlasting tube can even be engraved with your initials. You’ll certainly find a shade to suit, but I urge you toward the reds, as they include Dior’s famous 999, a pillar-box paint in a matte, satin, velvet or metallic finish, and the less famous (but more my poison, since it’s more orangey) Strong Red. Both look terrific against otherwise simple spring makeup. The whole kit and caboodle is £32, then £25.50 to refill when the bullet is spent.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Ditch single-use lipsticks – make like Rihanna and embrace refillables | Sali Hughes,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/19/ditch-single-use-lipsticks-make-like-rihanna-and-embrace-refillables
3/19/2022,"Not everyone wanted Tom Broughton to buy the flat he now lives in. The tenant who was there when he viewed it three years ago said, “You don’t want to live here. It’s freezing. It’s mouldy. You can’t hang pictures.” Broughton’s surveyor “strongly recommended” that he didn’t go through with the purchase. And his parents were similarly baffled: “You’re spending how much on a one-bedroom, ex-council flat?” But Broughton persisted. “I couldn’t not,” he says. The flat is on the fifth floor of the Isokon building, a sculptural, concrete behemoth in north London that is viewed as a modernist masterpiece. Design-led estate agency The Modern House called it “one of the most important penthouses in London.” Broughton didn’t need convincing. He had spent more than a decade obsessing over the building, its history, its contents, and the lives lived within it. It was designed by the founders of the Isokon design company – husband and wife Jack and Molly Pritchard and architect Wells Coates – to create a model for modern, urban living. The block of 34 flats was finished in 1934 and marketed as all-inclusive, serviced apartments. (Broughton shows me an old ad for the flats that offers “A very full domestic service: shoe cleaning, window cleaning, everything done for you, meals in the flat or in the club.”) The development attracted artists, architects and writers (Agatha Christie once lived here). The Pritchards also welcomed influential émigrés, including Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus; László Maholy-Nagy, the Hungarian painter, teacher and photographer; and modernist furniture designer Marcel Breuer. All of these are named on the building’s English Heritage blue plaque. Residents kicked back in the Isobar restaurant on the ground floor – a club open to tenants and their guests (Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson and Piet Mondrian were regulars.) Left-leaning intellectuals could enjoy a three-course meal cooked by Philip Harben, now recognised as the first TV celebrity chef. A sample menu reads: “vegetable soup, boiled cod and egg sauce, port wine type jellies (just so).” Residents could also hoist their dinner directly into their flat via a dumb waiter. But the party didn’t last. The building was sold to the New Statesman magazine in the late 1960s, and to Camden council in 1972. Broughton first saw the block 20 years ago, when he was new to London from his native Leicester, and by then it was in a dismal state. Eventually, in 2002, it was sold to a housing trust, then sensitively restored by Avanti Architects in 2004. Broughton – founder of spectacles company Cubitts – set up an alert on Rightmove and bided his time … The front door of Broughton’s penthouse, where the Pritchards themselves lived, is made of Plymax (copper-coated plywood). As Broughton points out, the couple strayed from their ideals by having, essentially, a gold front door on their own flat. They had intended to live in one of the more “minimal” units, but, finding it too pokey, commandeered the communal roof terrace and built a penthouse. Inside, it is a small, perfectly preserved plywood box. There is a minuscule fitted kitchen – U-shaped, built for one (the dumb waiter has gone) and a perfunctory bathroom, with shower over the bath and an original glazed door. A spartan panelled bedroom has a bed, two stools and the original fitted wardrobe. At the end is the main space – a generous living and dining room that opens on to a private terrace three times the size of the flat. Many original features remain. The plywood panelling is intact and has aged to a glowing golden brown; Broughton uses the same sock tidy and trouser rack as Jack Pritchard; the tempered glass shelves in the living room have been in situ since 1934. Broughton has added his own collection of plywood furniture, most of it connected to Isokon. There are three Penguin Donkey bookcases designed by Egon Riss for Isokon in collaboration with Penguin; two Marcel Breuer Long Chairs designed to “give scientific relaxation to every part of the body”. The sofa is by Robin Day, a friend of Jack and Molly’s, and the dining table and chairs are by Alvar Aalto, a Finnish furniture designer Jack visited in the 1920s. Two of Broughton’s favourite possessions are 1930s tea trolleys designed by Gerald Summers. A third, much rarer design is in the V&A. Wistfully, Broughton shows me an image of it on his phone. I ask if the Grade I-listed flat feels like home, or if he feels as if he is living in the venerated past? A century after the birth of modernism, do the ideals stack up? “You have to make a bunch of concessions,” he admits. “A lot of people want comfort and convenience. Here, there’s no lift – you have to go down five flights of stairs to take the rubbish out. The windows are single-glazed, so it’s not the warmest flat in the world, and the kitchen is so small there’s no room for a dishwasher or freezer. But these are just little ways in which you have to shift your life.” Broughton did feel a weight of responsibility when he moved in. Unsure how to care for his “plywood box”, he sought the advice of furniture designer and restorer Nick Goldfinger – grandson of architect Ernö Goldfinger. He encouraged Broughton to rub Danish oil into the woodwork, which he dutifully did for two weeks, to give the panels a renewed lustre. Broughton also patched up the flat roof, tinkered with the original underfloor heating, and repainted the ceiling the regulation off-white. “I quite like the fact that you can’t really do anything else. It’s just choosing the furniture and living in it.” The Isokon tea trolleys and bookcases remain a direct source of inspiration. “In the 30s, these weren’t pieces that filled people with a huge amount of excitement, but actually, that in itself is a kind of beautiful design challenge,” he says. “It’s the same with glasses. For most people, they are a functional item. But good design shows they can still be beautiful and interesting.” The Isokon Gallery, telling the story of the building, is open Saturday-Sunday, 11am-4pm",Lifestyle/Life and style,Modernist love: stylish 1930s living in the Isokon building,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/19/modernist-love-stylish-1930s-living-in-the-isokon-building
3/19/2022,"New dating show, then. Come on, we can do this. Come on! I know, I know. There have been a lot of dating shows in the past year. No, yeah, I get it. Always exactly the same. Neon light in the makeup room. Cameras embedded in every part of the beach house. Lingering shots of people scrubbing their face in the shower. Slowed-down acoustic cover of a dance song. A fast-forward drone shot of the sea! Someone who is 19 years old and ready to settle down! A low-depth swimming pool and plentiful facilities to sleep outside! The slow, gnawing feeling of claustrophobia! I know. But the BBC has decided BBC Three has to be a real channel again, and so they need a Love Island-lite dating show, and we have to go through this dance again. I’m just as unhappy about it as you are. I’ll go through this quickly because I’m tired: Love in the Flesh (Wednesday, 10pm, BBC Three) is the curiously goth-titled new dating format that is just Love Island but not quite as Love Island-y. Love Island has irreparably damaged the TV landscape for years now, and will continue to for about the next five. Post-Love Island, we have the weaponised horniness of Too Hot to Handle, the hoodwinkery of Ready to Mingle, we have a landscape where Love Is Blind is allowed to happen, and I would even argue that the ancient format of Married at First Sight had a Love Island-adjacent uplift. By the year 2032, it’s estimated one in two people in Britain will have worn a beltpack mic and made a to-camera confession that they “fancy one of their fellow islanders”. It is now deeply unlikely you will make it to the grave without going on a dating show invented by a streaming giant and saying “so what are you thinking?” to someone who is squinting in the sun but refuses to get up and find some sunglasses. Anyway, Love in the Flesh. Five couples who have all spoken on apps or Instagram but have never met up in real life … meet up in real life. There is a beach house, there are bottles of champagne, there are single beds and Zara McDermott is there. You would think this feels like a fairly weak hook: that once the couples actually meet (some have been speaking for three months; some for five years) they establish almost instantly whether they have chemistry or not and then that is that. But that wouldn’t make for a TV show, would it? So instead, they are condemned to share this huge beachside mansion, constantly pulling one another aside for a chat, going on little set-piece picnic dates and having their “relationships” “challenged”. This is more a failure of format than execution. Fundamentally, there is possibly something almost interesting about seeing two people who have shared extensive back-and-forths and video calls and photographs and late-night chats finally meet to see how it translates – a very long-anticipated first date, if you like. If they did a version of this that was “First Dates, but they’ve already swapped a couple of nudes” then it would kind of work. But because everything needs to be in an anodyne mansion on a sunny island now, the final shape of Love in the Flesh jars against the initial seed of it: it is not very interesting to see these people have or not have chemistry in this environment. Even if they did have chemistry, the sun and the tedium and the constant TV-ness of it would beat it out of them. So essentially you’re just watching 24-year-olds not really talk to one another, in Greece. There is almost some redemption in here. The casting isn’t quite up to the slick reality TV debutant level of other shows – there are a couple of people here who have Love Island bodies and Love Island faces but inside something about them is rogue, weird, freakish, and seeing them in this setting among other people who are just hoping this gets them 100k Instagram followers and a free gym membership is strange and fraught. McDermott – a Love Island graduate herself – is a refreshingly odd pick as well: none of the contestants are particularly dazzled by her as a famous entity, so she’s able to perch on the edge of the sofa with them, gossip as they gossip, and speak to them more as peers and equals than someone with cue cards issuing instructions from a producer. Still, it’s not very good. Shall we meet here again for the next one in, what, two weeks? Maybe three weeks?",Arts/Television & radio,Love in the Flesh: it’s Love Island-lite – but have they swapped nudes beforehand?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/19/love-in-the-flesh-its-love-island-lite-but-have-they-swapped-nudes-beforehand
3/19/2022,"Armed conflict, especially when fought against a more powerful enemy, produces the loftiest national rhetoric. It keeps our spirits up, and we tend to remember the best bits. In his speech to the Westminster parliament last week, Volodymyr Zelenskiy echoed Churchill’s “We shall fight on the beaches” passage from his post-Dunkirk oration, but the Ukrainian president might just as appositely have referenced one of Britain’s most hostile critics. “These are the times that try men’s souls,” the English radical and American patriot Thomas Paine wrote in 1776, when the American revolutionary war was only a year old and its outcome far from certain. “The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country,” Paine continued, “but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered: yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.” The words began Paine’s essay in a pamphlet – the first of 16 – that he hoped would inspire and sustain the colonists’ opposition to London rule. Like a lot of rhetoric, it includes nonsense more apparent today than when it was first heard or read. King George III is now nobody’s idea of a tyrant, and when Paine compares London’s oppressive regulation to slavery – if it isn’t slavery, he says, then “there is not such a thing as slavery upon Earth” – he reveals a remarkable blindness to the real, non-metaphorical chattel slaves who underpinned so much of the American economy. Still, “the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot” is a memorable phrase, the prose has an appealing rhythm, and, not the least of their attractions, the titles of the pamphlets place them firmly in the modern age. Some were called The American Crisis and others simply The Crisis. A more urgent era had begun. The word itself is ancient – from the Greek krisis meaning decision, used by Hippocrates to describe the turning point in the progress of a disease that leads either to recovery or death. By the 17th century its usage had begun to spread beyond medicine. In 1627, Sir Benjamin Rudyerd MP, trying to mediate between Charles I and parliament, spoke of the “crisis of parliaments; by this we shall know whether parliaments will live or die”. Astrologers were soon using the word to describe a conjunction of the planets that was critical to human affairs. Gradually, it came to mean something more prolonged than a life-or-death moment. The factory owner and social reformer Robert Owen edited a short-lived newspaper, The Crisis, that promoted “the change from error and misery to truth and happiness”, while Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto describe “crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial, each time more threateningly”. In the 20th century, anxiety and feelings of powerlessness became central to the experience. Charles Madge and Tom Harrisson, founders of the Mass Observation movement in the crisis-afflicted 1930s, decided that the word had no very exact meaning, but had come to be one of those things, like epidemics and earthquakes, “which suddenly arrive to threaten the security of our ordinary lives”. National or international, a crisis was “a kind of melting pot for boundaries, institutions, opinions”. It was the last that most intrigued Madge and Harrisson: how opinions were formed, how they changed, what they were alleged to be, and what they actually were. The Munich crisis of September 1938 and the events leading up to it gave Mass Observation a marvellous chance to find out, and its 1,500 voluntary observers – interviewers and eavesdroppers in the cause of a primitive anthropology – were deployed to record both public and private moods. The results appeared in a Penguin Special published the next year, price sixpence. I bought a secondhand copy 50 years ago, and it remains a favourite book. There’s so much life, variety and wit in it. (Observer to barmaid in Bolton: “What do you think of the Austrian crisis?” Barmaid: “Oh, I’m not fussy.”) Britain was a different country then – patriarchal, monocultural, with newspapers, BBC radio and rumour the only sources of information outside the personal experience of family and friends. Nonetheless, attitudes that were common then still persist. The bad news of 1938 produced reactions that have become familiar again in the past few years. One is that there is simply too much of it – too much news, too much of it bad. Mass Observation found the public’s interest in crises was decreasing. After all, what could people do to change things? A clerk in 1938: “I am getting tired of people talking about wars in Spain and China … if people start talking about another war I feel like saying, ‘For goodness sake shut up.’” My neighbour in 2022: “I buy the Week and read it once a week. That’s it. I never read, watch or listen to any other news for the sake of my psychic health.” Wife (to me) in 2022: “Should we switch from the Today programme to Radio 3 in the morning like we did during Covid?” Newspapers were by far the biggest opinion formers in 1938, though the people whose opinions they formed often didn’t trust them. Madge and Harrisson pointed out the irony: “It is like being led through [a] strange country by a guide who may turn out to be a gangster. Hence most opinion, except the most fanatical, is tinged with uncertainty … ” Today, mainstream sources of news are flatly contested as well as distrusted. Walking to the tube to get to the Russian embassy the other day, and carrying a placard (STOP PUTIN, STOP WAR), my wife had two encounters. A man by an ice-cream van shouted to her: “You’ve got to be careful about your sources of information … CNN is putting out poison … You’ve got to keep your radar spinning.” Then, at the station, a woman who turned out to be Russian approached, trembling and hyperventilating. “No, no, it’s lies, it’s American lies,” she said. “The Ukrainians have been killing people for years … in the war they would shoot children.” My wife said that in Russia they couldn’t be having this conversation, and the woman said frankly that was true. “But the Americans will soon make it like that here, too.” Russia had better things to do than invade Ukraine, morally and practically. The permafrost is melting all the way across Siberia, swelling the land as if it had boils and releasing huge quantities of methane. A force of nature, it may well be unstoppable – impossible, unlike the burning of fossil fuels and chopping down of rainforests, to moderate by changing human behaviour. This is a crisis to end crises, and a rhetoric has still to be found to match it.

3/19/2022,"If you look at the England team Eddie Jones has picked to face France, it does not take an expert to work out that the ball is going to see a lot of air time on Saturday. What fascinates me, however, is how different both sides’ approaches are to kicking and whichever side can impose their particular style will go a long way towards winning the contest. Jones has picked George Furbank at full-back, which may have come as a surprise to some because he had a difficult time on his debut at the Stade de France two years ago and because Freddie Steward is so reliable under the high ball. France, however, really don’t kick to compete that much. They kick long, they want to lure their opponents into running the ball back, when they back themselves to turn the ball over, or they want to engage in a game of kick tennis, when they can be lethal if their opponents do not execute properly. As a result, Furbank’s decision-making will be key, and significantly more important than his ability to claim the ball in the air. To illustrate, Stuart Hogg carried the ball 14 times in Scotland’s defeat by France. For those carries he made only 14 metres post-contact, which tells me that a lot of the problem was bad decision-making. The problem, though, is that France have scored seven of their 14 tries from receiving kicks, which hints at why Hogg would have been reluctant to kick deep. The key, then, is for England to make good decisions and execute their contestable kicks. Throughout the tournament, from 37 box-kicks or up-and-unders on their ball France have retained only one. Of the 45 that they’ve received, they’ve failed to gather one in four. That tells me that they are vulnerable in the air if England contest and clearly Jones has identified Steward against Gabin Villière as a mismatch that can be exploited. Jones and his coaches will have watched how France performed against Wales, they will have seen weaknesses in their aerial game and will look to follow suit. My mind goes back to the 2019 fixture at Twickenham, when England thrashed France and Jonny May scored a hat-trick inside the first half. That was France’s low ebb, they are an entirely different side and, crucially, they have Shaun Edwards as defence coach, because that was the most disorganised back-three I’ve ever seen. I can’t remember a time when the Twickenham pitch has been made to look that big. I don’t, for one minute, expect a repeat of that but the point is that England got their joy that day from kicking and in a similar way they’ll look to again. They’ll seek to force France into mistakes, just as they did that day and though the errors are unlikely to lead directly to tries, as was the case then, they may give England territory or possession from which they can build. England will also take plenty of confidence from their kick-chase against Ireland. Hugo Keenan is excellent under the high ball and it was not so much that he was being beaten to it, it was more that England’s chasers were able to wrap him up and force the turnover. Granted it was Johnny Sexton on that occasion but Maro Itoje’s shuddering hit in the second half, after chasing one of Ben Youngs’ box-kicks, lingers in the memory and Steward’s chasing was excellent too. Sam Underhill can add to England in that sense. His weight of tackle and choice of tackle is outstanding. His return is incredibly timely with Tom Curry out injured and he’ll be on a one-man mission – just like Joe Worsley or Lewis Moody used to be. If he comes off having made 25 tackles and not touched the ball he’ll have had a good game. That may sound a bit negative but he’s not been picked to do anything other than repel this big, heavy, yet mobile French team. Setting the tone early is also going to be key – it can’t be as bad as last week – but if France spill an early high ball or two then the crowd will start to get jittery and England can take advantage of that. For all that France have been setting the standard this tournament, they have not been in this situation before. Yes, Edwards has with Wales, but none of the players, none of the other coaches have been going into a grand slam match. England must try to exploit that sense of the unknown and take France to a place they have not been to before. Ireland managed it for 60 minutes and ultimately it was not enough but England will have to do it for the full 80. I’ve been critical of England’s attack in this tournament and for large parts it just hasn’t functioned. They’ve managed two tries outside the Italy match which just isn’t good enough and I really don’t see England outscoring France in terms of tries. That means that it is time for England to go back to their DNA as opposed to trying to develop their attacking structure. They need to focus on four key areas – the scrum, the lineout, their defence and their kick-chase. It was the tactical approach that they adopted with 14 men last week and I fully expect them to do it again with 15. It is going back to basics, it is putting the “New England” project on hold, but it is time for this side to deliver a result.",Sport/Sport,Six Nations fate is up in the air as England bid to deny France grand slam | Ugo Monye,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/19/france-have-not-been-in-this-position-and-england-six-nations
3/19/2022,"Paddy the Baddy and Meatball Molly are laughing, again, in a place of dark pain. On Kempston Street, in the heart of Liverpool, the Next Generation MMA gym rocks with joyful noise even though it is here that Paddy Pimblett and Molly McCann practise their bone-breaking kicks and punches. On the mat, and in the cage upstairs, they are flung to the ground by heavier sparring partners who grapple and half-choke them in a restrained imitation of everything that awaits on Saturday night at a sold-out O2 Arena. The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) steams back into London for the first time in three years and the Liverpool fighters threaten to blow the roof off as Pimblett and McCann each take their turn in the cage. Pimblett is being called the next Conor McGregor and he is not shy in promising to “take over the organisation” and become “the UFC’s new cash cow”. His great friend McCann, his “big sister”, has overcome poverty, drug addiction in her family and depression to come out as gay and be the first English woman to win a UFC fight. Her nickname stems from her past work in Subway, where she left every shift smelling of meatballs. She also knows what it is like to win a fight with a shattered eye socket and to be choked unconscious. They understand the danger facing them but they can’t stop kidding around on a Wednesday morning. “I’m a fat little kid at heart,” Pimblett says as he and McCann talk about biscuits and politics. McCann has just pulled on a blue Ukraine T-shirt, having decided the Russian onslaught means she should save her Fuck the Tories top for another day, which sets Pimblett off on a riff. Custard Creams top his list of unacceptable “Tory biscuits” but he makes an exception for deluxe M&S Shortbread, which he finds so delicious they belong in the feast he will demolish after his fight against Rodrigo Vargas on Saturday. Pimblett smiles and ruffles his blond mop-top when I suggest this is not typical fight-talk. “That’s why I have so many fans,” he says. “I look like the kid next door. Most fighters show off their big muscles, they sneer and snarl, tattoos all over them. I’ve got this haircut and not a single tattoo. But I turn into a different person in the cage. I get tunnel vision and all I think about is this guy in front of me and how I put him to sleep.” The 27-year-old, who describes himself as a socialist and the greatest MMA lightweight in the world, nods when I ask if he really believes he can approach the astronomical fame and wealth McGregor accumulated before hubris diminished him. “Yeah. I see myself being bigger than that, because the sport has evolved even more than when Conor made it mainstream. He had twentysomething lads following him where I’m getting kids from the age of five. Kids look at McGregor and see a big, hard fella with loads of tattoos. Kids have got long, floppy hair, they haven’t got tattoos. They can identify with me.” McCann chips in. “Paddy might not look like a fighter and, with the mouth he has, you wouldn’t expect him to do all he does for the community. The two of us are totally mad characters but we come from the best and hardest city in the world.” After she shows me her tattoo – “My city, my people, my heart” – in tribute to Liverpool, McCann says: “You’ll never meet another Patrick Pimblett or Molly McCann. I don’t know if it’s because I’m a girl and he’s a boy, but we push each other to be better versions of ourselves and don’t envy each other’s success. If he gets a big sponsorship then it’s: ‘Go on, lad, well done.’ If I get more airtime he’ll say: ‘Go on, Moll, it’s right.’ I have not one ounce of doubt in Patrick Pimblett’s ability to be the best in the world. Together, we’ll change the game.” Last September, in Las Vegas, the UFC was given its first taste of the Paddy and Molly Show as Pimblett made his debut and McCann entered the last fight on her contract. Pimblett intrigued America’s MMA community with his accent and bold proclamations that he would soon be “the main man” in UFC. McCann, meanwhile, knew that defeat would spell the end of her UFC career. At 31, she would be cut adrift. They were under enormous pressure. Pimblett needed to match the monumental hype as he moved up from competing in Cage Warriors events after he had turned down offers to switch to UFC twice before. McCann was fighting for survival. “It was intense,” she says, “but there were so many warm moments where it was just me and him. I said: ‘Patrick, I feel a bit nervous. Are you?’ He went: ‘I am, Moll. But we’ll just get on with it.’ He said to me before I won the [2018 Cage Warriors] world title: ‘We’re scousers and we’re the best people in the world. Go show them what we’re made of.’” In Vegas, McCann beat Ji Yeon Kim and earned herself a new four-bout UFC contract and an extra $50,000 for a fight-of-the-night bonus – with Pimblett getting the same amount for knocking out Luigi Vendramini in the first round. A heavy shot jolted him before Pimblett finished Vendramini with a barrage of blows. “Not really,” he says when I ask if he was hurt. “Look, lad, scousers don’t get knocked out.” McCann says: “After Paddy got his KO I ran to the cage, screaming ‘We shook up the world, lad!’ March 19, at the O2, will solidify everything.” Pimblett adds: “It’s going to be a scouse invasion of London and the only thing I can compare to it is when Conor McGregor fought in Dublin. But it’ll be louder than that. Remember the O2 roof got ripped off by Storm Eunice? What a bad name for a storm. Don’t worry. Storm Baddy is about to hit London.” We drive to Pimblett’s home in Huyton where he grew up. He talks about his growing friendship with Ronnie O’Sullivan and how their fathers were in prison at the same time – and how Rio Ferdinand found him at Anfield the night before. The former England defender had to be asked by Jake Humphrey to get back to football when, live on BT Sport before Pimblett’s beloved Liverpool played Internazionale, Ferdinand spoke excitedly about meeting the Baddy. Pimblett looked like the Pied Piper as awe-stuck young fans followed him. McCann, who supports Everton, was not there. But Pimblett laments that Kenny Dalglish accepted a knighthood. “I hate the establishment,” he says, “the royal family and the Tories.” He also talks about the contract – “worth well over a million pounds” – he has signed with the American company Barstool Sports and the vlogger from Philadelphia who has moved to Liverpool to follow him and post daily content online. Then, passionately, Pimblett explains his bitter dispute with Instagram, which shut down his account when he had almost a million followers. He uses his social media accounts to raise money to help a little boy called Lee Hodgson receive experimental treatment for terminal cancer. When a troll “posted something despicable about Lee”, Pimblett contacted Instagram. After he had been told that no guidelines had been breached he called Instagram “dog-shit” and “lizards”. His account was closed, which cuts off a key route of public access as well as costing him money. Pimblett will send a stinging message to Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram from inside the cage on Saturday. “I’m grabbing the mic and calling Zuckerberg out because the weird thing is he goes on about getting bullied at high school and in college. Why are you letting the bullies win now? Instagram’s an absolute disgrace. The guidelines are ridiculous. “I’ve had people messaging me saying ‘I’m going to rape your mother’ or sending me pictures of Hillsborough, calling Liverpool fans ‘fence-munchers’. Their accounts are still open. But mine gets taken. I feel sorry for Vargas [his opponent]. I’m going to take his head off because of Instagram. The post-fight speech is going to be biblical. I’m going to sing Justice for the 97 [of Hillsborough] with the whole arena at a crazy decibel level. Then I’ll just go – mic drop.” There will be humour, as always, because he has ordered 1,000 lookalike blond wigs for his raucous fans. But there is also anger on behalf of Liverpool. “What the government has done to our city for years is disgusting. Knowsley [the borough in which Huyton is located] is the worst-funded in the whole of the UK today. People think I’m talking about 40 years ago. But there are kids in this city eating out of food banks. We’re not a Tory area. It’s that simple.” Pimblett is on his phone for large chunks of the day, answering requests for support, and this desire to help others drives him in the UFC cage. It makes him certain he will surpass McGregor one day. “I’ll be a billionaire eventually,” he says, “and there won’t be no kids eating out of food banks in this city then. I’ll make sure of it.” Pimblett insists he will never leave Liverpool. His fame, however, is approaching the stage where he will need security and he might have to move to a new house so that people can’t turn up at his front door for a selfie. But his ease in being visible at other times will continue – as will his prolific social media output, which includes a amusing podcast. “The reason I called it Chattin’ Pony is because, in Liverpool, it means you’re chatting a bit of shit. Tomorrow, I’m doing a new episode with Molly and it’s just us sitting there having an unscripted conversation. We’ll be chattin’ pony and before you know it we’ll have had 200,000 downloads.” We’ve been “chattin’ pony” for so long that Pimblett has to call McCann and tell her we are running late for my interview with her. She is typically understanding and, half an hour later, we’re back in the city centre and across the road from the Subway where she worked so hard while starting out as an MMA fighter. McCann asks me if she should watch the evocative documentary about her that is now available on BT Sport. She is worried about the emotions it might unleash before the fight because, having seen it, I tell her about some of the most moving moments. The documentary opens with her first UFC fight, in Liverpool in May 2018, and captures her devastation after she blacked out during a choking headlock. “There had never been a female champ like me in Cage Warriors,” she says of the organisation where she made her name. “Patrick sold the most tickets, I’m No 2 and Conor McGregor’s No 3. So getting signed to the UFC was a dream. I knew that as long as I’m in that cage, you’re going to have to put me to sleep to stop me. And that’s what happened. “My mum took me to a hotel next to the arena. She’s clean and sober now but she bought me a cider. She was like: ‘Drink that.’ I sat there, my head swirling, feeling that losing my UFC debut in my home city was the end of the world. My mum said: ‘You’re cut from my cloth. So go to your after-party and be grateful for what you’ve achieved.’ I said: ‘Fucking hell, Mum, can’t you give me 10 minutes?’ She went: ‘No. Go see your people.’ “I still ended up crying non-stop and got back to my hotel about 10. I went for a Chinese and when I walked in the whole restaurant looked at me and went: ‘Ahhhhh.’ They’d all seen it. A man came over to me and put £100 on the table and said: ‘You’re not buying your dinner tonight, girl. This is on me and my family. Thank you for representing the city so well.’ It meant so much because he understood lots of people will submit and tap out – but not me or my city.” In her next fight, at the O2 in March 2019, McCann suffered a broken orbital bone and could not see out of her swollen eye for the last round. She still won the fight. “I had four minutes to change the rest of my life and I drew on all the past adversity and found strength. I was thinking this was a good fight to show what scousers are made of because every step I’ve taken in life, every positive thing I’ve accomplished, I attribute to this city. It got me to where I’m going – to where Patrick and I are going.” McCann’s most difficult battle has been coming out. “At first I couldn’t even think about my sexuality because we had so much going on in my family. The proudest thing for me was my last name. If anyone can, Molly McCann can. When I went to university I opened up and when I started MMA, with its jujitsu ethos that we are all one, it became easier. Your creed, sexuality, religion don’t matter in this gym. “But I still struggle to sometimes bring it up. I have had people go: ‘Oh, that’s fucking gay’ and then they’re like: ‘I shouldn’t have said that, Molly. I’m sorry.’ When I wrote a little book for kids [about being gay] my friends and family members rang to say: ‘I am so sorry I made you feel that way.’ That’s absolutely fine, just don’t make anyone else feel that way.” Tears roll down her face but McCann is soon smiling again. She wipes her eyes. “One of the proudest things I can say is that, like Paddy, I am a scouser. Think about Irishmen and women who had so much adversity through the Troubles. We’re very similar. Jamie Webster released a song called This Place and it made me cry. In fight week, when Paddy and I are warming up, I’ll put that song on and we’ll sing: ‘My people, my city, my heart …’” Meatball Molly looks up, her eyes shining as she thinks of herself and Paddy the Baddy. “We owe it all to this place and, on Saturday, we’ll light up the O2. Paddy and me will show it’s not all talk or bravado or arrogance. It’s an affirmation of hard work and belief. We’re gonna turn London into a scouse house party.”",Sport/Sport,Fighting for Liverpool: Paddy the Baddy and Meatball Molly’s UFC takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/fighting-for-liverpool-paddy-the-baddy-and-meatball-mollys-ufc-takeover
3/19/2022,"When England were pitted against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup, it was time for Steve Cooper to show Gareth Southgate his homework. Cooper, who had led England to the under-17 equivalent of the competition the previous year, was tasked by the Football Association with studying the South American side throughout the tournament and flew to Russia to present his findings to Southgate, the staff and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, in the buildup to the last-16 match in Moscow. “Dan always used to challenge the coaches: ‘If you were the England manager, how would you set up? What would you do?’” says the England goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, who later worked with Cooper at Swansea. “The tactical detail was incredible. He gave us a full insight into what Colombia were, really. You were looking at Steve and thinking: ‘Yeah, you know your stuff.’ It is a daunting task but Coops did an amazing job.” England ended up winning on penalties. Now Cooper’s focus is on Nottingham Forest and facing Liverpool, where he spent five years coaching in the academy, in Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final. His work with England’s under-17s, including with Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher and Jadon Sancho, enhanced an already blossoming reputation. Cooper arrived at the FA from Liverpool, where he became academy manager and coached Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Since taking charge at Forest in September, Djed Spence, 21, Brennan Johnson, 20, and James Garner, 21, have thrived. “Over a long period, Steve will have worked with some of the best young players in the country,” says Ian Foster, the England Under-19s head coach who, with Mike Marsh, assisted Cooper at the Under-17 World Cup. “In terms of his recruitment at Swansea, he had worked with [Marc] Guéhi, Gallagher, [Rhian] Brewster [with England]. The players know him, they trust him, they like his ideas and they know what sort of coach and person he is. He knows how to handle young players. He’s got tons of experience.” For Cooper, it all started at Wrexham when his manager, Brian Flynn, encouraged the full-back to pursue coaching and he became the club’s head of youth development. In the early days he juggled taking the under-18s at Wrexham with playing part-time for Rhyl, Bangor and The New Saints. By the age of 27, he had his Uefa pro licence, the highest coaching qualification available. Liverpool liked what they saw and appointed Cooper as a youth coach. Frank McParland, then the academy director, promoted Cooper from under-16s to under-18s coach. Cooper worked closely with the technical manager at Liverpool’s academy, Pep Segura, adopting the former Barcelona coach’s philosophy. Cooper’s passion radiated to his players. “He is the most dedicated manager I’ve come across, in terms of his appetite, his eagerness, his energy, his buzz,” says Jordan Lussey, who Cooper named under-18s captain at Liverpool. “We got to the FA Youth Cup semi-finals [in 2013] and played Chelsea over two legs. I’d be out locally around Ormskirk on an evening and get a phone call off him saying: ‘What do you think about this? I’ve got this idea.’ Or: ‘Come into the office tomorrow, I need to show you something.’ You would sit down, the two of us at a computer, and he would show you what he wants from you in a game, what their weaknesses are and that is another reason he has had great success. Any situation that was put in our way, you knew your job.” Cooper, born in Pontypridd, 12 miles north of Cardiff, is meticulous – on and off the grass. “There is not a stone that Steve leaves unturned,” says Margetson. “Even the smallest detail is important to him. He is across everything. The dressing room, how it is set up and how meeting rooms are set up, etcetera. One of the things he did around the training ground was make it feel more like Swansea City. He put images of the players all around the training ground and images of the supporters cheering on the team. He was proud to manage Swansea and he knew what it meant to the people. and he often referred to that in meetings and he did a lot of brilliant motivational [pre-match] videos for the players, showing them the history of the club.” The 42-year-old, whose father, Keith, was a referee, is an unassuming character and although a deep thinker and level-headed, he can be firm when required. “If he needs to give you the hairdryer treatment, he will,” says Lussey, now with Curzon Ashton. “If he needs to give you praise, he will. That’s where he gets that mutual respect from top to bottom. He’s not your best mate where you can just mess about or not put in the work. He will pull you up properly and let you know what he thinks.” Swansea’s hierarchy were wowed by Cooper during his interview and, after guiding the club to successive play-off finishes on a modest budget, unsurprisingly there was Premier League interest last summer and he held talks with Crystal Palace. Forest identified Cooper as their first-choice target after sacking Chris Hughton when bottom of the Championship. They have risen to eighth, Wednesday’s 3-1 home win over QPR continuing form that looks capable of securing a play-off place. Since his appointment six months ago they have lost only four times. “He is very much a family man, but he lives and breathes football,” Margetson says. “If he’s not thinking about Forest, he’ll be watching games somewhere. You can’t just rock up and land in the Championship – you have to earn your stripes and study the game and there is no doubt that Coops has done.” When Forest kick off against Liverpool at the City Ground, Foster will be watching on television at St George’s Park, cup of tea in hand. “I am immensely proud of him,” Foster says. “I think when you’ve not had a wonderful playing career it’s harder to establish yourself as a coach. He’s had to do it the hard way and is reaping the rewards of that. He has been a shining light for coaches at the FA and beyond. He will play it down but I’m sure he’s itching to pit his wits against one of the best coaches in the game.”",Sport/Football,Steve Cooper: making of a World Cup winner with Liverpool in his sights,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/steve-cooper-nottingham-forest-liverpool-fa-cup-world-cup-winner
3/19/2022,"The sporting greats operate on a different plane, not only of performance but of personality. Lewis Hamilton has never been more demonstrably of this pantheon. As suitably ominous winds swept across the desert surrounding the Bahrain International Circuit on Friday before Formula One’s season-opening race, Hamilton was preternaturally calm before the storm. Buffeted by the blows of disappointment from last year’s finale and now about to begin the season on the back foot, Hamilton cut a remarkably relaxed, composed figure in the paddock. Yet there is a very singular resolution to his character of which his rivals should be very concerned. Hamilton is at his absolute best when coming back from adversity. “I will be a more aggressive driver this year, you’ll see,” he said here. “I want to be the best I can be and to somehow raise my game. I’m not sitting here with any grudge and I don’t have any baggage. It is important to let go and all I do is try to shape what is ahead of me.” The driver competing for a record eighth F1 title is far from the youth who made his debut in 2007. Now 37 and in his 16th season, the young man who made such a mark in his early years with his raw talent has honed it with mental strength and fine judgment. His remarkable success has not merely been a factor of superior machinery, he has been the differentiator. This season might yet be the hardest he has faced; this title would be the crowning moment of a glittering career. Last year he battled fiercely against Max Verstappen in a Red Bull that was, for large parts of the season, the better car. He dragged it to the wire, the final race in Abu Dhabi. Leading at the Yas Marina circuit, he was denied only when a controversial decision by race director Michael Masi gave Verstappen the opportunity to take the win and the title on the final lap. Hamilton described the result as manipulated, his Mercedes team protested but it came to nothing. He has acknowledged that Verstappen was not at fault, having only executed exactly as any driver would have done. He congratulated the Dutchman, remarkably stoic in the face of bitter disappointment, then retreated afterwards, silent on social media amid debate over whether he would retire from the sport. There was, it transpired, no such thing on his mind. He intended to come back. He has a point to make, after all. The mercurial talent of Verstappen, buoyed by his first title, confident, aggressive and spoiling for a fight in a car that looks fearsomely quick again, is the first of Hamilton’s obstacles. Were that not enough, entering the new season Mercedes look to be under pressure. They are by no means in real trouble but in what may be a three-way fight with Red Bull and Ferrari they have problems to solve. Their car has a genuine issue with what is known as porpoising. An unexpected side effect of the new regulations, it causes the car to heavily jar up and down on a straight. It is caused by the floor being pushed too close to the track by the under-car ground-effect downforce. It stalls the airflow under the floor, resulting in a loss of downforce lifting the car back up on its suspension. Mercedes have it badly and their resultant lack of pace is not sandbagging. On Thursday, Hamilton’s new teammate, George Russell, confirmed it, noting that he believed it could not be turned around this week. The car has the potential to be very quick, just not yet, in which time Verstappen could grab a significant lead. Jenson Button, who drove alongside Hamilton at McLaren for three years between 2010 and 2012, believes his mentality will prove key. The pair enjoyed a very competitive rivalry with Button being one of only two teammates (alongside Nico Rosberg) who have managed to beat Hamilton on points over a season. He recalls Hamilton’s greatest strength as one rare among drivers. “If he had a bad weekend it hit him hard but he always came back stronger than he was before,” Button says. “It was unusual because a lot of people it would have affected in a negative way but he always came back in the next race and go out and either win or beat me, he was very unusual like that, in that a tough weekend spurred him on at the next one.” This time Hamilton is coming back from more than just a bad weekend, rather, what any driver would consider their worst nightmare. But Button, a world champion himself for Brawn in 2009 and now ambassador for the Williams team, instinctively identifies Hamilton as appearing to be wholly on top of it. “Everyone thinks F1 is a physical game, it’s not, it’s a mental game,” he says. “So many drivers have amazing ability but if their head’s not in the right place it just doesn’t work, it does not click.” Hamilton has clearly been clicking like a metronome. Nor should he be expected to open the season with anything but absolute commitment as his words in Bahrain make clear. Last year, playing the long game, he was circumspect around the aggressive Verstappen, discretion the better part of valour. Points over point-making. This year there will be no early pass. If the pair go wheel-to-wheel Hamilton can be expected to push back from the off. Youth may have its head but not without consequences. “From the word go, Lewis now understands the beast Max Verstappen,” as Button noted. At Mercedes there is without doubt no shortage of determination to come back after what they felt was an injustice rather than a straight defeat. Hamilton will be leading their charge. “It’s like a new lease of life for Lewis,” adds Button. “He comes to this season so excited about the fight again because he has finally found someone who can push him to the limit.”",Sport/Sport,‘Aggressive’ Lewis Hamilton ready to compete for eighth world title | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/aggressive-lewis-hamilton-ready-to-compete-for-eighth-world-title
3/19/2022,"The Booth family tombstone in Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore, is, as Karen Joy Fowler describes it in this epic novel about the distinguished 19th-century American theatrical clan, “a marble obelisk … almost twenty feet high”. Like that obelisk, the Booth name still casts a long shadow over the US landscape: today we remember the family chiefly because one of its sons, John Wilkes Booth, was the assassin of Abraham Lincoln. Everyone knows the story. It’s 14 April 1865. The civil war is effectively over, and Lincoln is at the theatre, watching a play, when he is shot in the head by one of the actors, who has climbed into his box and pulled out a pistol. Lincoln dies the following morning. Booth goes on the run but is hunted down and killed 13 days later. The nation is plunged into despair; this presidential death – the first such assassination in US history – will leave a lasting scar. What’s past is prologue: the rest of the novel both is, and isn’t, a build-up to that moment. How to deal with the narrative problem of John Wilkes and this inevitable climax is (as Fowler acknowledges in the author’s note) there on nearly every page. She handles it adroitly, interweaving Booth’s story with that of his parents and siblings, a tale that’s colourful and tragic enough in its own right. This isn’t Fowler’s first try at capturing the fraught dynamics of the family, of course: it follows 2013’s We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, her novel about an extraordinary experiment in adoption. That book, which has a narrative shock in store for the reader partway through, probes familial bonds and the nature of love in an “ordinary” American nuclear family. The Booth family story begins with Junius Brutus Booth, the celebrated Shakespearean actor, who flees charges of bigamy in England in 1821 with Mary Ann Holmes, a Drury Lane flower seller (no spoilers here: we’re in the realm of history). Their 10 children are born in near penury on a remote farm in rural Maryland. Lavishly talented, terrifyingly unstable and a committed vegetarian, Junius is the source of much comedy, some of it benignly culinary (“Suddenly Father, who once thought it murder to eat an oyster, has decided they should all be eating fish. None of the children like fish, so this is nothing to celebrate”). And some less so: when his old friend Andrew Jackson becomes president and they disagree, Junius threatens to cut Jackson’s throat. Later we remember that detail. This is a century dominated by men. Four of the Booth children die in infancy; of Junius’s surviving sons, Junius Jr, Edwin and John all follow him on to the stage. His daughters – sad, dutiful Rosalie, haunted by the apparitions of her lost siblings, and temperamental Asia, who will grow up to become the family chronicler – know that they don’t count. Rosalie “never wanted to be the centre of a story, not even her own”. John, on the other hand, who is a Confederate sympathiser, isn’t content to be an observer. He “has always had this need to be in the story”. What’s more, he has “Father’s madness without Father’s genius to excuse it”. His sense of destiny is also fuelled by a dangerous family myth: when he was a baby, his mother saw a special future for him in the flames of the parlour fire. As a grown man he shows off by quoting Macbeth: “Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires.” Did the real John Booth ever say this? He was an actor; he might well have. Booth’s sheer heft and scope – at nearly 500 pages, it spans a century – suggest that Fowler’s interest lies as much in the mythopoetic potential of the family epic itself as in a particular set of historical events. History may claim to be about facts, but stories, like families, are largely about feeling, and the novel gives us feeling on a grand scale, even as it asks pertinent and topical questions about who owns those facts. For Booth actually contains two family stories: that of the Booths, and that of the Halls, the slaves who live on their property. Joe and Ann Hall have been owned by the Booths and their neighbours for most of their lives and have seen their own children routinely sold to other households. That the anguish of this other parallel story is largely invisible to the Booths perhaps treats the material more eloquently than another approach could have. The novel is haunted not just by the ghosts of the Booth dead, but of the Hall children who are lost to the living death of slavery. When the Halls manage to buy back one of their daughters, Ann’s only visible sign of emotion is her refusal to let the child out of her sight. She’s not a trained actor but she performs her part, of pretending that all of this is normal, better than any Booth could: they “could take acting lessons from her (and probably any other slave in the South as well)”. Ann’s agony and her relief at having her daughter restored to her are all the more powerful because they are unspoken. As these family stories converge with the wider national narrative in America’s traumatic civil war – in which the question of individual states’ control over the slave system was central – we realise that they’ve never been distinct at all (“We cannot escape history,” Lincoln said). It’s a pity, then, that after so much bravura storytelling the last part of the book sometimes reads like a curt historical precis, as if Fowler has finally been overwhelmed by the weight of her material – or perhaps the simple and entirely creditable desire not to misrepresent it. But this hardly matters. In its stretch and imaginative depth, Booth has an utterly seductive authority. Fowler has pulled off that supremely difficult thing in a historical novel: to convince us that there are things she may have made up, but which are nevertheless true.
