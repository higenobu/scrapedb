4/19/2022,"Victims of crime are giving up on ever getting justice, Keir Starmer has warned, as Labour underlined official figures that show a quarter of reported crimes in England and Wales are being dropped for lack of evidence, with victims deciding not to support further action. The party leader promised to restore faith in law and order, saying that more than a decade of Conservative governance had left the justice system on its knees. And he accused the prime minister, Boris Johnson, of further undermining public confidence by personally breaking the law and then refusing to resign. “Faith in the criminal justice system to deliver for victims is a pillar of a civilised country. Under the Conservatives, it’s being devastatingly undermined. As ever with this prime minister, the institutions he vows to protect are being damaged,” Starmer said. “As director of public prosecutions, I saw the essential value of victims knowing that they would be backed to the hilt until justice was served. Twelve years of Conservative government have decimated the system, leaving too many people in an emotional and financial limbo, and more likely to give up on getting the justice they deserve. “This is all in addition to a prime minister who shows no respect for law and order. How can the country have faith in the system if even when justice is served, it apparently has no consequences? Britain deserves better. With Labour, victims will come first, and criminals will be punished.” Home Office data shows that 25.5% of reported cases in England and Wales were dropped due to “evidential difficulties” in the year ending September 2021, with the victim not supporting further action. The majority of those – representing 20.9% of the whole – came despite a suspect having been identified, the figures showed. That was up from 20.7% in the year to September 2020, and 18.2% in the year to September 2019. And it is more than treble the first figure recorded in the relevant Home Office dataset, which was 6.9% in the year to March 2015. Johnson has faced repeated calls to resign after receiving a fixed-penalty notice for attending a birthday celebration thrown in his honour in the Cabinet Room of No 10 in June 2020, at a time when indoor socialising was banned under Covid rules. He has apologised and paid the notice but made no indication that he would step down, saying he wanted to “focus on the job in hand”. The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/Law,Keir Starmer: crime victims are giving up on justice under Tory rule,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/18/keir-starmer-crime-victims-giving-up-justice-tory-rule
4/19/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has said Manchester United’s visit to Anfield must be considered the most important three points of Liverpool’s lives when they attempt to displace Manchester City at the Premier League summit on Tuesday. Liverpool can follow their FA Cup semi-final victory against City by replacing Pep Guardiola’s team at the top of the table, for 24 hours at least, with a point against Ralf Rangnick’s underachieving side. United’s caretaker manager admitted after the win against Norwich on Saturday that his team needed to raise their game to get anything at Anfield. Klopp, however, insists Liverpool’s old rivals remain a dangerous foe and victory is of critical importance to his team’s title chances. “If we let United do what they want, they will cause us massive problems,” the Liverpool manager said. “We have to be in the right mood to fight for the three points and not want to show we are in a better moment than United. Who is interested about that? There are times when you have better moments than other teams but then you get a knock and that’s it with the better moment. Who cares? “They want the three points we need. We have to be angry in a good way, greedy, like you are if you have won nothing and would be with nil points and it’s the most important three points in your life. That’s the attitude we need for this game, otherwise the quality is too high. United are too good for not being in that mood.” Liverpool humiliated United at Old Trafford in October with a 5-0 win that signalled the beginning of the end for Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Rangnick, his temporary replacement, has been unable to spark an improvement, winning 50% of his Premier League games to leave United’s Champions League qualification prospects in jeopardy. But Klopp maintains there is no short-term solution to transform any major club. “We had a similar situation when I started here,” Klopp said. “We were not flying from the first day. Let me say it like this, and you might have thought after six or seven weeks: ‘Is it really much better than before?’ When you are in that situation, you just accept that you need all the steps. You cannot just put on a magic sprinkle and go from there. “What is a good example is the 3-2 against Norwich. You win 3-2 at home, it’s the Premier League, it is a home game you have to win it and you won it. Great. But because of the situation they are in they have to explain why it is only 3-2. What was our result at home to Norwich? 3-1, so not much better and we struggled in moments and they had good football situations and you think: ‘Come on, forget it, 3-1, three points, professional business, go from here.’ “But with the situation they are in, they have to explain why it is only 3-2, why you have to give them two goals and things like this. That would be the same in all big clubs in the world and that’s what we all have to deal with. “It is completely normal that expectations are always short-term, never long-term. You want the advantage now and forever, and not from five months on and forever. That is the problem we all have. That might be the situation there. But we don’t face the team who has problems, we face Manchester United. The goalkeeper is world class, the last line absolute top, then [in midfield] I’m not sure if McTominay and Fred can play and it might be Pogba and Matic, then up front you can choose from Sancho, Fernandes, Elanga or Rashford. That’s what we have to prepare for, not what happened last week.”",Sport/Football,Klopp urges Liverpool to be greedy for points against Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/18/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league
