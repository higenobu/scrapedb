3/20/2022,"The British pound has rallied significantly during the course of the week to show signs of strength, reaching the ¥156.50 level. The market has been very strong, but it looks as if the ceiling is getting very close. That being said, if we were to break out above the ¥158.50 level, then it is likely that the market goes towards the ¥160 area. The market will continue to see a lot of volatility, and I do think that it is going to be difficult to hang on to the upward momentum without some type of major catalyst. It is worth noting that this pair has been in a range for a while, and therefore until it proves itself, you really cannot get overly excited one way or the other. That being said, it is possible that we get a bigger move in either direction, but I will probably have to drill down to shorter time frames in order to get the trigger price. Until we break out of this consolidation area between ¥158 and ¥149, I think you have to look at this as a situation where it is just going to be noisy overall, and therefore, I think you need to focus more on shorter-term charts. The pair is highly levered to risk appetite, so you need to pay close attention to how other markets are performing. The Japanese yen is considered to be “safe”, while shorting it means that there is a lot of risk appetite out there. Keep an eye on stock markets.

3/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Democrats in Congress are taking aim at big oil as they seek to deflect blame for eye-popping gasoline prices that could sink their prospects in the midterm elections. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Russia Says It Used Hypersonic ‘Kinzhal’ Missiles to Attack Biden Warned Xi of ‘Consequences’ for Backing Russia in War Putin Set a Trap for Ukraine and Walked Right Into It Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Talks Are Russia’s ‘Only Chance’ Both the Senate and the House are calling executives from the nation’s largest oil and gas companies to testify, saying the industry isn’t passing the benefits of record profits on to consumers at the pump. “I remain concerned that the oil industry is not doing enough to protect American consumers from rising gas prices,” Representative Raul Grijalva, chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, wrote to company executives in a letter sent Friday. The committee is requesting testimony from executives from EOG Resources Inc., Devon Energy Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. for a planned April 5 hearing to “examine the fossil fuel industry’s failure to help stabilize American gasoline prices.” The Senate Commerce Committee is planning a hearing, “The Corrosive Effect of Elevated Petroleum Prices on American Commerce and Consumers,” that will focus on pump prices, according to a letter seen by Bloomberg News and sent by Senator Maria Cantwell, the committee’s chair. Among the witnesses being sought is Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods, according to the letter. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is also seeking the testimony of executives from BP Plc, Chevron Corp., Devon Energy., Exxon, Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Shell Plc for a hearing planned April 6 on their company’s business practices and the industry’s impact on consumers. “The industry appears to be taking advantage of the crisis for its own benefit,” Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat who chairs the committee, wrote in letters this week asking executives from the companies to testify. Earlier: Biden Takes Aim at Big Oil Amid Accusations of Price Gouging West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, have dropped from multiyear highs touched after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but still remain over $100 a barrel, and the national average for unleaded regular gasoline was $4.27 a gallon Thursday, according to the automotive club AAA. The near record-high price levels pose a significant issue for President Joe Biden and Democrats. A second planned release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this month announced by Biden has had a limited effect. Industry Response The oil industry’s top lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement that the criticism from Democrats amounted to “political grandstanding.” “The American people seek solutions from their elected leaders to help alleviate the pain they are feeling at the pump,” said Frank Macchiarola, API’s senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs. “Congress and the Biden administration should focus on policies that increase U.S. supply and encourage investment when it is needed most, rather than political grandstanding.” Asked about the plans by Democrats to hold hearings, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responded Friday that Democratic policies are to blame for higher gasoline and energy prices. “They’ve made their platform to put oil industry out of business in America and increase the business of Russia, Iran and Venezuela,” McCarthy said of Democrats during a news conference. “They turn around and see the price is high. We have warned them about this time and again because of their policies,” he said. “Every action they’ve taken has put us in this place.” Democratic lawmakers are underscoring the oil industry’s profits in demanding questions. “There are certainly questions about the oil companies, how they are spending very substantial profits. Buying back stock. Big dividends,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he also plans to call oil and gas executives to testify “and explain why they see fit to reward shareholders instead of finding ways to give Americans a break at the pump.” “It is nothing short of repugnant for oil companies to be touting what are truly dizzying profit margins, while soaking American families with these exorbitant prices,” Schumer said in a floor speech Thursday.

3/20/2022,"The Australian dollar has been all over the place during the course of the week, as we continue to see a lot of noise in both directions, and the 50 Weekly EMA is flat, right along with the 200 Weekly EMA. The pair of course is highly volatile and levered to commodities, which of course makes it a bit of a headache at the moment. Commodities continue to rise, but at the same time, we have seen quite a bit of US dollar strength overall. Looking at the chart, the 0.75 level above should be a major resistance barrier, so if we can break above there it would be a very bullish turn of events, opening up the possibility of a bigger move to the upside. On the downside, the 0.70 level is a major support barrier, and therefore I think it is difficult to imagine a scenario where we break down below there. However, if we did break down below there, it could open up a flood of selling. In general, this is a market that is going to be very choppy and move upon the latest whims of risk appetite. This of course makes it a bit difficult, but I think is probably only a matter of time before we have to make a more impulsive move. I think the next several weeks are going to be difficult, so you are probably better off looking at this through the prism of trading more short-term range-bound moves than anything else. Keep your position size reasonable, as I just do not see volatility dropping anytime soon. For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

3/20/2022,"(Reuters) -The Russian rouble fell in light trading in Moscow on Friday, with trading on separate exchanges stabilising beyond 100 to the dollar, after the central bank opted to hold rates at 20% and said it would start purchasing OFZ government bonds. The central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged on Friday, in line with a Reuters poll of analysts, following an emergency rate hike in late February, but warned of higher inflation and an economic contraction this year, without giving new forecasts. The central bank's actions have come in support of an economy buckling under the stress of sanctions from across the globe, triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine late last month. U.S. President Joe Biden sought to prevent Beijing giving new life to Russia's troops in a video call with President Xi Jinping on Friday as stalled Russian forces pressed on with bombardments of towns and cities. The rouble ended 1.6% weaker against the dollar at 104.82 in Moscow, and fell 0.95% to 114.80 to the euro, while rising for the week against both currencies. It has lost about a fourth of its value over the past four weeks. In offshore markets, rouble bids were last indicated at 102.75 per dollar and traded at 105. Trading on the stock market section on the Moscow Exchange has been closed for weeks but currency trading has continued. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who was nominated for another term by President Vladimir Putin earlier on Friday, said the bank would begin buying OFZ bonds when the Moscow Exchange resumes trading those papers on Monday, hoping to limit volatility. Evgeny Suvorov, economist at CentroCredit Bank, said the bank had made clear this was a temporary measure to limit financial stability risks, and not akin to the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank's quantitative easing schemes. ""The central bank is afraid that the market at opening will go to hell and this will tear apart a load of banks and investment companies,"" he said. COUPON PAYMENT The rouble showed limited reaction to an indication that Russia had averted a default on its foreign currency bonds, after it paid interest due on two sovereign dollar bonds seen as a key test after the imposition of hefty sanctions. Those sanctions increased demand for foreign currency, which prompted the central bank to ban the selling of cash dollars and euros to individuals at banks' offices. A month ago, the Russian currency traded at around 76 to the dollar and 85 to the euro. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in late February in what it called a special military operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities.
