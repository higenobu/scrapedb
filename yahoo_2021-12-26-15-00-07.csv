12/26/2021,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will compensate companies to keep secret patents with potential military applications under proposed legislation, the Nikkei reported on Sunday, without citing sources. The patents under review in the proposed economic security legislation will include technology that can help develop nuclear weapons, such as uranium enrichment and cutting-edge innovations like quantum technology, the financial daily said. The Prime Minister’s Office, the Cabinet Secretariat and Japan Patent Office were not immediately available for comment outside business hours when contacted by Reuters. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last month pledged that he will make the nation's economic security a policy priority https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-panel-urges-govt-launch-88-bln-university-fund-2021-11-08. His government will give compensation of roughly 20 years of licensing income to the companies falling under the legislation, the Nikkei said. The framework of the legislation will be released as soon as next month, the report said, with cabinet approval scheduled for February and expected application of the measures in the fiscal year from April 2023.

12/26/2021,"Authorities scrambled a search and rescue operation overnight northwest of Paros. Air and sea assets were deployed to the area, the coastguard said. A video released by the coast guard on Saturday (December 25) showed the migrants boat sunken beneath the sea. The country's semi-official Athens News Agency said the bodies of 12 men, three women and an infant were recovered from the area. The 63 rescued were taken to shelter on Paros island, with some receiving first aid treatment. Eighty people were believed to have been on the vessel, which according to the coastguard was believed to have been headed for Italy from Turkey. The circumstances under which the vessel capsized were unclear. Giannis Plakiotakis, Greece's shipping minister, said trafficking gangs were responsible for the disasters. Earlier Friday, Greek authorities said they had recovered 11 bodies from the scene of another shipwreck, when a sailboat carrying migrants sank off the uninhabited islet of Prasonisi, near Antikythera island in southern Greece on Thursday. Another 90 people were rescued in that operation. The coastguard said initial information suggested those migrants had also been heading for Italy. Overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday another boat thought to have been carrying up to 50 migrants sank off the island of Folegandros, with dozens feared missing. Greece is one of the main routes into the European Union for migrants and refugees from Africa, the Middle East and beyond, though the flow has tapered off since 2015-2016, when more than a million people traversed the country to other EU states.",World/Reuters Videos,At least 16 dead in third migrant shipwreck this week,https://news.yahoo.com/least-16-dead-third-migrant-043931370.html
12/26/2021,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau implored the West to stand together against China, arguing that country's communist leadership has often been ""playing"" Western countries against each other. ""We need to do a better job of working together and standing strong so China can't play the angles and divide us one against the other,"" Trudeau said in an interview with Global television. The Canadian Prime Minister said the problem occurs as many Western countries attempt to gain access to China's massive market, letting China dictate the terms and pitting Western states against each other as competitors. ""We've been competing and China has been, from time to time, very cleverly playing us off each other in an open market, competitive way,"" Trudeau said. Canada's relationship with China has been strained in recent years, most notably after Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese national, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. extradition warrant in 2018. China detained two Canadians soon after, a move Canada saw as retaliation for the arrest of Meng. Meng eventually reached a deal with U.S. prosecutors in September, resulting in the release of the two Canadian nationals. Canada has also been highly critical of China's human rights record, joining other western countries in a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. The boycotts have not been well-received by China, which said they violate ""the principle of political neutrality of sports established by the Olympic Charter and runs counter to the Olympic motto ‘more united,’"" ""The U.S. will pay a price for its practices. You may stay tuned for follow-ups,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian after the U.S. announced its diplomatic boycott.",World/Fox News,Trudeau says western countries need to stand together against China,https://news.yahoo.com/trudeau-says-western-countries-stand-212340974.html
