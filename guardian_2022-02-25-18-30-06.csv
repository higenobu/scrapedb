2/25/2022," Rian Johnson’s twisty homage to the Agatha Christie-patented murder mystery is also a satirical tease, forever teetering on the edge of the ridiculous. The usual suspects have been rounded up: a country house setting; a possible murder (of Christopher Plummer’s thriller writer); an all-star cast of family members bearing grudges; and an eccentric gentleman sleuth. Amid the flashbacks and unreliable witnesses, Daniel Craig enjoys himself tremendously as private eye Benoit Blanc, probing the motives of Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Toni Collette et al; while Ana de Armas’s nurse vomits if she tells a lie, but still has something to hide …Saturday 26 February, 9pm, Channel 4 In Billy Wilder’s heartbreaking comedy, Jack Lemmon plays nervy accountant CC Baxter, “a good sport” who lets his insurance company bosses use his flat for their adulterous liaisons, with the promise of promotion in return. Slowly and subtly, Wilder draws out the loneliness in Lemmon’s character, as getting his own office fails to make up for the distress caused by enabling executive Fred MacMurray’s affair with Shirley MacLaine’s sweet but clear-eyed lift operator Fran. The delay in getting to the romance makes it all the sweeter.Saturday 26 February, 1pm, BBC Two Imaginatively transposing the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata by Aristophanes to present-day Chicago, Spike Lee’s 2015 musical drama is both topical in its denunciation of Black-on-Black gang violence and timeless in its themes of love and respect. Teyonah Parris plays Lysistrata, girlfriend of gang boss Chi-Raq (Nick Cannon), who is inspired by the death of a child to initiate a sex strike by all women in the city until the male-initiated killing stops. Lee’s caps-lock visual style melds potent musical numbers and rhymed dialogue to fine effect.Saturday 26 February, 9pm, AMC Writer-director Ben Wheatley revisits the hallucinogenic folk horror realm of A Field in England in this intoxicating lockdown-shot drama. Scientist Martin (Joel Fry) and guide Alma (Ellora Torchia) head deep into a forest to check on his old boss Olivia (Hayley Squires), who is researching the mysteries of fungi but hasn’t been heard from in months. However, Reece Shearsmith’s creepy nature worshipper Zach has plans of his own, as the boundaries between real and shroom-induced life begin to blur.Sunday 27 February, 10.45am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Tilda Swinton reunited with director Luca Guadagnino after the exquisite I Am Love for this dark tale of passion under the Mediterranean sun – but it’s Ralph Fiennes who steals the film. His impetuous music producer, plus daughter (Dakota Johnson), turn up at the Italian island getaway of Swinton’s rock singer – who is recovering from vocal surgery – and her younger lover (Matthias Schoenaerts). The newcomers bring fun, energy and dangerous emotions.Wednesday 2 March, 1.55am, Channel 4 Daisy Edgar-Jones pivots here from the emotional nuances of Normal People to gristly horror, though the perils of dating are a common thread. Singleton Noa seems to have found her ideal man through a supermarket meet-cute with Steve (Sebastian Stan). However, his absence from Instagram – a red flag for best mate Mollie (Jojo T Gibbs) – is only the first in a string of events suggesting there is something off about him. The plot twist half an hour in (no spoilers!) flips Mimi Cave’s film into a state of black comedy it sustains gleefully for the rest of its potboiling story, as Noa fights for her survival.Friday 4 March, Disney+ One of the funniest women today, Amy Poehler, pays tribute to one of the funniest women of yesteryear, Lucille Ball, in her fascinating new documentary. Ball’s will to succeed and comic skill are to the fore as we see her turn a middling Hollywood career into record-busting TV stardom in the 1950s, alongside her co-star and producer husband, Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz Jr. Their love story is central to a tale that also touches on male power and female agency, the immigrant experience, communist witch-hunts and, crucially, Ball’s legacy for female performers.Friday 4 March, Amazon Prime Video",Arts/Television & radio,Knives Out to Lucy and Desi: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/25/knives-out-to-lucy-and-desi-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
2/25/2022,"By the end of the 19th century, the Sassoon family were regularly referred to as “the Rothschilds of the East”. This wasn’t just lazy, it was wrong. For one thing the Sassoons’ interests and influence stretched right around the world from Shanghai via Bombay, London and Lancashire, all the way to the Atlantic coastal plain of the United States. Then there was the fact that, unlike the Rothschilds, the Sassoons were not bankers but traders, specialising in opium, cotton and oil. What perhaps the late Victorians really meant when they compared the Sassoons to the Rothschilds was simply this: they were very rich and they were Jewish, a combination that conjured ambivalent feelings not just in “polite” society through which antisemitism flowed like a subterranean river but, over time, in the Sassoons themselves. Joseph Sassoon, who is a descendant of the dynasty’s founder David, believes that it was his family’s experience as serial immigrants that drove their success and explains their decline. Their original role as treasurers to the pashas of Baghdad meant that they seamlessly acquired the Arabic, Turkish, Hebrew and Persian that equipped them to do business throughout the vast Ottoman empire. When in 1828 they were forced to flee to Bombay as a result of a pogrom, they quickly added Hindustani to their repertoire and settled down to rebuild their lives, using their tried and tested methods of exemplary ethics and ferocious hard work.  In order to avoid a repeat of that first expulsion, though, the family needed to become adept at reading the political landscape and adapting accordingly. Joseph Sassoon points out that the treaty marking the passing of India’s governance from the East India Company to Queen Victoria in 1859 was signed not in the residence of the outgoing governor but in “Sans Souci”, the home owned by the man whom the Illustrated London News described as “Mr David Sassoon, the well-known wealthy Jew Merchant of Bombay and China”. In the face of such antisemitic sneers, these early Sassoons were careful not to draw unwanted attention to themselves. While their fortune was one of the great wonders of the industrialising world, it was offset by a thoughtful philanthropy that built hospitals, libraries and schools for the whole community. These productive years as “good immigrants” did not last, and it is the Sassoons’ fall from fortune that gives this somewhat dry family history its emotional heart and narrative pace. Within a hundred years of hosting diplomatic milestones, younger members of the family were pawning their jewellery and filing for bankruptcy. It is, Joseph Sassoon thinks, a story of assimilation and gentrification going hand in hand with the dissipation of cultural capital. A case in point: Siegfried Sassoon, great-grandson of David Sassoon and the writer of some of the most blistering war poetry of the 20th century, was lip-curling about what he called his “Semitic sovereigns”, ignoring the fact that it was this patrimony that gave him the time and space to write. It need not have been this way. Joseph Sassoon, who is a professor of history and political economy at Georgetown University, points out that other families made the transition from active business to genteel philanthropy while still managing to protect their fortune through the deployment of trusts, strategic successions and careful financial planning. The Sassoons, by contrast, went on subdividing their money among their increasingly shiftless descendants, none of whom had a business-like bone in their body. It was all a far cry from the administrative brilliance of the original Sassoons of Baghdad and the mercantile sophistication of the following generation. They built, Joseph suggests, the first truly global business, able to grasp the connection between the silk harvest in France and the price of rice in Shanghai, or the way that sugar in Java could be sold at a profit in India. That they lost this panoptic capacity, settling instead for a cosy and blinkered parochialism, is the great tragedy that underpins this fascinating book.

2/25/2022,"In Haitian Vodou, the potomitan is the central pillar that holds up the temple. At its base is where ritual sacrifices and offerings take place; along its shaft are carved the foundational images of the religion, encouraging spirits to pass through its structure and transmute into the bodies of the faithful who surround it. It is an apt symbol for jazz bassist and vocalist Sélène Saint-Aimé’s second album. Written largely during the pandemic, when Saint-Aimé left Paris for her native Martinique to be with family, there is something deeply enigmatic and yet solidly structural about these 11 compositions.  First: structure. Guadeloupean ka drummer Sonny Troupé and Martiniquan bèlè drummer Boris Reine-Adélaïde anchor Saint-Aimé’s composition with their undulating improvisations, providing rhythmic resistance and a sense of form to her operatic soprano, along with the horns of trumpeter Hermon Mehari and saxophonist Irving Acao. Arawak Uhuru centres on the triplet structure of the drummers, while on Bezaudin, the drums even play the melody as their skins are pressed taut and then released to create bending pitches. And on tracks such as Indigo Bay and Charlie Parker cover Bird, Saint-Aimé’s bass provides a rhythmic substitute, as she chooses her notes and placement with delicate care to create a hip-swaying swing. If the drums and the bass are the structural object, it is Saint-Aimé’s voice that lends Potomitan its spiritual quality. Her vocals mostly eschew lyrics for a personal, improvised form of language – a kind of otherworldly scat. Switching easily from a crystalline falsetto to bassy, staccato tones, Saint-Aimé’s formidable yet deeply human range may remind listeners of Beverly Glenn-Copeland. Her warm tone draws us into whispered intimacies on the tender, yearning Mélisande (a theme from Sibelius’ Pelléas et Mélisande orchestral suite), while on Akaye, her vibrato echoes the breathy horn melody. The title track condenses the album’s essence into 90 seconds of vocals, bass and drums, Saint-Aimé’s yearning a capella swiftly embellished with double-time, polyrhythmic drum beats. To listen to Potomitan is to be immersed in this fluid world of Saint-Aimé’s making – harnessing her Martiniquan roots to create music that is as grounded as it is malleable, as earthly as it is spiritual. Ugandan rapper Ecko Bazz releases his second LP, Mmaso (Hakuna Kulala), combining jittering footwork and 808 beats with a guttural screech that would make Danny Brown proud. Turkish singer-songwriter Anadol touches on woozy pop, fragmented jazz and psychedelia on her latest, freewheeling release Felicita (Pingipung). Vocalist Somi produces a charming, starry tribute to the late South African singer Miriam Makeba on Zenzile: The Reimagination of Miriam Makeba (Salon Africana), featuring Gregory Porter, Seun Kuti and Angelique Kidjo.",Arts/Music,Sélène Saint-Aimé: Potomitan review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/25/selene-saint-aime-potomitan-review-caribbean-jazz
2/25/2022,"The owner of British Airways, International Airlines Group, more than halved losses to €3.5bn in 2021 and expects to return to profit this year as long as operations are not significantly disrupted by Covid-19 or the invasion of Ukraine. The company, which made a record €7.4bn (£6.4bn) loss in 2020, said that passenger levels were still only 36% of pre-Covid levels last year.  The company said that the impact of Omicron on traveller confidence has hit bookings in January and February, meaning it will make a “significant” loss in the first quarter. Passenger capacity is expected to be at 65% of pre-pandemic levels in the first three months of the year. However, it expects to return to profit in the second quarter, driven by an increase in bookings for Easter and summer that will underpin “significantly positive” operating profit and cashflows for 2022. Capacity is expected to hit 85% of pre-pandemic levels across the year. “This assumes no further setbacks related to Covid-19 and government-imposed travel restrictions or material impact from recent geopolitical developments,” the company said. Luis Gallego, IAG’s chief executive, said the company is “monitoring events closely to manage any potential impact”. He said: “We are confident that a strong recovery is under way. We expect a robust summer with IAG returning to around 85% of its 2019 capacity for the full year. Our model enables us to capture revenue and cost synergies while maximising efficiencies, which means we are set up to return to profitability in 2022.”",News/Business,BA owner IAG reports €3.5bn loss as it monitors Ukraine developments,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/ba-owner-iag-reports-loss-as-it-monitors-ukraine-developments
2/25/2022,"Charities have urged the UK government to welcome refugees from the conflict in Ukraine on the same scale as the thousands of families from the Balkans resettled during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s. In a letter to the Times, the charities, which include Save the Children, Amnesty International and the Refugee Council, asked the UK to lead international cooperation to “handle a sudden increase in the number of people forced to flee” the conflict, which threatens to be the most significant in Europe since the collapse of Yugoslavia.The US has warned that five million people could be displaced by the conflict.  The UK government said its priority is to support British nationals and their families in Ukraine, and the government position is that people fleeing persecution should seek safety in the first safe country they reach. An estimated 100,000 Ukrainians are already internally displaced after fleeing their homes to escape attack, while footage on social media shows lines of cars heading west into neighbouring Poland, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. The UN has appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking safety. The letter from dozens of charities urged the government to implement a “well-resourced initiative working with councils across the country” to support Ukrainians in search of sanctuary, similar to the evacuation and resettlement programme during the Balkan conflict. Visa applications from Ukraine for people who are not related to British nationals are currently suspended, meaning there is no legal route for them to enter the UK and claim asylum. A source told the BBC the government is “scenario planning” for an increase in asylum seekers from Ukraine. The charities said the crisis “illuminates the crucial flaw” in the nationality and borders bill, which discriminates against refugees who reach UK shores by illegal means, such as by boat across the channel.The charities wrote: “We urge the government to rethink this harmful bill and uphold our proud record of helping those fleeing war and oppression.” The prime minister has announced that the UK has 1,000 military troops on standby to support a humanitarian crisis in Europe, should they need to be called upon. On Thursday, the Home Office confirmed that work, study or visit visas be temporarily extended for some Ukrainians in the UK, or they will be able to apply for family visas or points-based immigration without leaving the country. This would grant them additional time to potentially find a job and stay in the UK for longer. Those already on the point-based system will be able to stay longer and seasonal agricultural workers will have their visas automatically extended until the end of the year. A government spokesperson said: “Our priority has been to support British nationals and their families in Ukraine. This has included temporarily waiving application fees for those eligible under the family migration route, allowing entry for 12 months for others who did not meet the requirements and fast-tracking visas. “We continue to work with our international partners on a range of issues as the situation develops, including migration.”",News/UK news,Charities urge UK to welcome refugees fleeing Ukraine conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/25/charities-urge-uk-to-welcome-refugees-fleeing-ukraine-conflict
2/25/2022,"Members of the Ukrainian diaspora across the United States have been responding with grief, rage and solidarity with their compatriots as Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of their country. Ukrainian-Americans from New York City to Sacramento have been expressing their growing anxiousness towards the escalating conflict, singing prayers, launching fundraisers and organizing solidarity rallies.  Currently, there are more than 1.1 million members of the Ukrainian-American diaspora. Ukrainians have been immigrating to the United States since the late 19th century when many arrived in 1877 to work in the Pennsylvania mines. However, the largest immigration wave came after the second world war where thousands of displaced Ukrainians sought refuge in large American cities including New York, Philadelphia, Detroit and Chicago. Many more fled during the cold war and also its aftermath, immigrating to the United States and Canada. In 2019, Ukrainians were one of the top groups resettled as refugees in the United States under the Donald Trump administration. In the Ukrainian American community in Detroit, one of the country’s largest and most active Ukrainian diasporas, people have been organizing prayer services and speaking with elected officials to urge them to speak up against Russian aggression. According to Mykola Murskyj, chair of the Ukrainian-American Crisis Response Committee of Michigan, there are about a dozen Ukrainian churches in southeastern Michigan, with many more Ukrainian Saturday schools, credit unions, grade schools and cultural centers in metro Detroit. These organizations have already been hosting rallies and launching fundraisers, said Murskyj, whose grandparents emigrated from Ukraine which was then part of the Soviet Union. “There’s a lot of anxiety and there’s a lot of determination,” she told the Detroit Free Press. Olena Danylyuk, vice chair of the Ukrainian-American Crisis Response Committee said she watched in horror as Russia invaded Ukraine on early Thursday morning. “It is hard to watch … We are extremely disturbed, saddened, and angered by the senseless violence,” she said. Danylyuk, a Ukrainian immigrant herself, told the Detroit newspaper that one of her sisters and her children have fled Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and are hiding in a small town. In New York City, members of the Ukrainian diaspora said their friends and families in Ukraine are prepared to fight. Oleksandr Matsuka, a retired United Nations diplomat whose stepson recently enlisted in Ukraine’s territorial defense forces and whose wife’s brother was preparing to leave retirement and return to the army, said, “Everyone does whatever he can.” “Ukrainians are not panicking. They are prepared to fight,” he said to members of the Self-Reliance Association of Ukrainian Americans, a seminar group nestled in the city’s East Village. New York’s East Village is home to the city’s largest Ukrainian diaspora and was once known as Little Ukraine, as over 60,000 Ukrainian immigrants lived in the community at one point. Andrij Dobriansky, co-chair of the United Ukrainian-American Organizations of New York has been inundated with text messages from Ukrainian friends who are in shock. “I have so many just single texts in my phone from people who are like, ‘I have no words’ and that’s it. This is not something anybody imagined could happen – to roll back the independence of a country,” Dobriansky said. In Sacramento, California, which is home to approximately 100,000 Slavic immigrants – most of whom came from Ukraine, many Ukrainian-Americans are finding solace through prayers. Yuri Shimko, who arrived in the US when he was six years old, is a part of a local Ukrainian church and has been praying for peace since the Russian invasion. “It’s sad to hear that it’s happening to our own people. As a church, we’re praying for them. We’re thinking about them,” he told Sacramento’s ABC10. Erik Latkovskii, the lead pastor secretary at Sacramento’s Spring of Life church, has opened up the church as a space for support and solidarity for Ukrainian Americans. “I’m far away. And it’s hard for me to do something right now, but I will pray to God,” Latkovskii said. Other members of the diaspora in Sacramento are fraught with confusion and fear. According to Ruslan Gurzhiy, editor-in-chief of Slavic Sacramento, “People are confused. People are fighting in comments with each other, arguing with each other, a lot of anger, a lot of fear, a lot of blaming each other.” As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asks for donations to the Ukrainian military and the country’s billionaires return to Ukraine to pledge their support, numerous Ukrainian-Americans have also been launching fundraisers stateside to assist with relief efforts. The Revived Soldiers Ukraine campaign, based in Orlando, Florida has been raising funds for Ukrainian soldiers injured on the frontlines. “I want our Ukrainian army to know that we, the Ukrainian diaspora of the United States, stand with them shoulder to shoulder,” said Irina Discipio, the campaign’s organizer. In Belmont, Massachusetts, Katya Malakhova is organizing the Sunflower of Peace fundraiser in which tactical backpacks filled with medical supplies are provided to Ukrainian marines and special forces units. Nova Ukraine, a non-profit organization based in Palo Alto, California has been identifying areas in Ukraine that are most in need of humanitarian efforts and has been raising funds to provide relief including gasoline, candles, diapers and food. Currently, the organization is raising money to buy dry food for children at the Donetsk Oblast orphanage in Donetsk. “We need your support as never before,” the group posted on their Facebook page. Across the country, numerous solidarity rallies have also been planned by Ukrainian diaspora communities, with many set to take place in major cities including Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia and Washington DC in the coming days. Nataliia Onyskiv, head of the Georgia branch of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that she has been touched by all the support coming in from beyond the Ukrainian community in the city. “From my personal experience, it means a lot. If you know a Ukrainian, make sure to tell them your heart is with them,” she said.",News/US news,‘Lot of determination’: Ukrainian Americans rally for their country,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/ukrainian-americans-solidarity-ukraine
2/25/2022,"At the grand old age of 82, legendary folkie Judy Collins is releasing her first ever collection of entirely original songs. After more than 60 years spent crafting stellar interpretations of classics by the likes of Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Stephen Sondheim, the pandemic gave her the opportunity to sit down at the piano and delve into her treasure trove of poems, turning favourites into song.  Mostly, these find her in understandably wistful mood, gazing back over a life lived. Grand Canyon and When I Was a Girl in Colorado reminisce about cowboys and calming wild horses. Uptempo country rocker Hell on Wheels offers sobering snapshots of more riotous times on the road. Happy memories collide with sad ones, sometimes in the same song. In the exquisite So Alive, she recalls a pair of young musicians in the Greenwich village folk explosion, their heads filled with dreams of rock’n’roll, but one of whom “left the world too early. Your spirit died too young.” There are ethereally lovely songs of people and places: Idaho (in Prairie Dream) or Arizona, “where antelope climb the ravine” and the passage of time brings the realisation that “everything sings and moves on, and all that’s forgiven is gone”. Some of the arrangements are too middle of the road, but her piano runs are glorious, her voice still as pure as mountain air and – with a second collection apparently following – she is far from done.",Arts/Music,Judy Collins: Spellbound review – nostalgic first album of originals,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/25/judy-collins-spellbound-review-folk-original-songs
