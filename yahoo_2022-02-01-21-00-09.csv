2/1/2022,"Isles of Capri is loved by many for its location, mix of homes, and access to fishing -- backwater and offshore. People visit for leisure dining offered through four restaurants in a tropical waterfront setting. When developed in the '60s, it was zoned residential with a centrally located area for minimal business/commercial enterprise. The zoning designation C-3 assures the ambience desired by residents who choose to buy as full-time or part-time owners. A developer, Fiddler's Creek, wants to change zoning to allow a 14-story condo, 200-seat private club restaurant, wet and dry boat slips, ship store, etc. to drastically alter the appearance and use of an environmentally sensitive island. As a 21-year resident, I join my fellow Capriers in strongly advocating no change of zoning. Paul Westberry, Naples For years, too many issues important to Naples residents were ignored. Two years ago a new city council was seated and they took action to tighten building variances, fully fund our storm water master plan and lakes remediation. They approved resident-only beach parking on many of our streets. Incumbent council members Terry Hutchison and Ray Christman led those efforts and are best equipped to continue voting for positive change for Naples. They understand that Naples is first and foremost a residential town, and that protecting our fragile environment is essential to long-term economic vitality. Beth Petrunoff is by far the most qualified candidate to join this leadership team. She shares their core values and also brings valuable business experience, team building knowhow and a refreshing can-do attitude. She has impressed voters with her in-depth understanding of the key issues. She is not tied to any special interest groups. She will be an independent voice with fresh ideas. Beth is worthy of broad voter support and will strengthen the team at City Hall. Vote Hutchison, Christman, Petrunoff. Anne Carlucci, Naples I am white. I grew up during the closing chapters of an era when one knew one’s place. We didn’t need to be taught that good people were Christians, that boys had more important roles in life than girls, and that being white was better. These were so much a part of our culture that, growing up, we knew which was our rung on the ladder. But times, they were a-changing, and current events challenged this order. George Wallace made a speech “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever” and was cheered for it. Schools integrated, sometimes with violence, the civil rights movement divided the nation, and Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize, but was later assassinated. Cities burned. Moral consciences awoke. Black History Month was incorporated into public schools in 1976, but it wasn’t until my own children attended school that it had an impact on me. I learned from their assignments that my ignorance was both embarrassing and blind. A void existed where there should have been a wealth of information on a topic fundamental and central to our development as a nation, and my own history. I lived and worked in the Washington DC area, and loved the city without knowing its majestic Capitol, stately White House, and gothic Smithsonian were built by slaves. I knew Frederick Douglass and Harriett Tubman, but nothing of Dr. Charles Drew, to whom I likely owe my life. My fathers and uncles all saw combat in WWII, but the roles of the Arlington Black code-breakers, Tuskegee airmen, and Air Force Gen. Benjamin Davis went unpublicized. Black History Month teaches American history. It teaches about war heroes, poets, artists, musicians, inventors, scientists, educators, authors, and the everyday heroism of ordinary men and women who have to struggle for what so many can take for granted. And it continues to teach me about the fabric of American life, the rich layers of its culture, the disparity that can poison our well, and the hopes I have for our future. Susan McGuire, Bokeelia Some have said that President Biden’s speech on the anniversary of Jan. 6 was divisive even though he had promised he would try to unite us. However, Biden knows that only the truth can unite us. As long as Trump Republicans believe the Big Lie we will never be united. Therefore, he made a strong argument for validity of the 2020 election and for the fact that the Big Lie is indeed a lie. Henry Hall, Fort Myers As a retired real estate agent thinking about Collier County affordable housing, here is what I see. There is not much now, with little in the pipeline. Commissioners approved a rental complex not long ago with some percentage of the apartments set aside for ""essential workers"" defined as health care, police and firemen. Since this complex will continue to be owned and managed by commercial interests, I suspect once complete the set-aside will somehow be forgotten. Incentives to developers have a way I believe of being forgotten as the profit motive kicks in and staff and commissioners change over time. My solution, which is not new, is that affordable housing can only be guaranteed by government sponsorship, ownership and management. Anything commercially owned will eventually succumb to market conditions and get elevated out of the affordable category. To enable the government involvement, I see three avenues open. First, subsidy by federal, state and local jurisdictions. Second by increased taxes on the general population who will be served by the occupants of affordable housing, and third by private contributions such as are frequently supporting our charitable, medical and social efforts to aid the less fortunate. Charlie Berry, Naples Local school board elections will soon be upon us. Please take note of the facts: Collier County Public Schools graduation rate remained high despite a pandemic, remote learning, and the challenges presented with having to deliver a whole new way of teaching via computer. Unlike other public school board meetings, Collier had few, if any, raucous, angry crowds, disrupting the business of the board. Keep political grandstanding out of the schools. Unlike five years ago, Kelly Lichter and Erica Daniels were not on the board, causing costly mediation due to their unreasonable, self-serving demands. Unlike many charter schools, Collier County Public Schools serves ALL children, regardless of their disabilities, family challenges and economic status. Public funding is meant to fund education for all children. Under the direction of Kamela Patton, superintendent, the schools were safe and well run. Indeed, Kamela Patton was voted best superintendent in the state of Florida; she is in the running for national recognition. Politics and self-interests have stayed safely away from the operations of our schools. The teaching staff are trained professionals delivering public education, separation of church and state, as guaranteed by our federal government. Re-elect our current functioning School Board, who have found the key balance between good business sense, high standards, fairness, and safety. Sandra L.

2/1/2022,"Elon Musk blocked the teen who has been tracking his private jet on Twitter, Bloomberg reports. 19 year-old Jack Sweeney created the Elon Musk's Jet Twitter account in June 2020. Musk offered Sweeney $5,000 to remove the account. Sweeney countered with $50,000, and Musk walked away. The 19 year-old who created a Twitter account to track Elon Musk's jet told Bloomberg the Tesla billionaire has blocked him. Jack Sweeney created the Elon Musk's Jet Twitter account in June 2020. The account uses bots to collect publicly available air traffic data detailing the movements of Musk's private jet. Protocol first reported that Musk had approached Sweeney late last year and offered $5,000 to get the account taken down, saying it posed a ""security risk."" Sweeney, who shared the Twitter private messages exchanged between himself and Musk with Insider, countered with an offer of $50,000. Musk declined, saying it didn't ""feel right"" to pay for the account's removal. In a new interview with Bloomberg, Sweeney said Musk blocked all social media accounts connected to Sweeney on Sunday night. ""You know, it's kinda strange, he wants it down and seems like he's really mad,"" Sweeney told Bloomberg. Sweeney told Insider last week Musk had introduced some measures he himself had recommended during their Twitter conversation, which make it harder to track the jet. Harder, Sweeney said, but not impossible. ""I just have to work around it,"" Sweeney told Insider. Sweeney said in his interview with Insider, conducted last week, that he was aware going public with Musk's offer might antagonize the billionaire. ""He'll probably be annoyed,"" Sweeney told Insider, adding: ""he went the opposite way of me so why wouldn't I go the opposite way of him?"" Musk and Sweeney did not immediately reply to requests for comment from Insider sent outside of regular US working hours.

2/1/2022,"The Miami Herald delivered a blistering rebuke of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday, slamming the potential GOP 2024 hopeful’s failure to outrightly condemn neo-Nazi demonstrations in Orlando at the weekend. In a scathing essay, the newspaper’s editorial board ripped DeSantis for downplaying the far-right group as “jackasses” and for then spinning questions on the protests into an attack on President Joe Biden and Democrats. “Denounce the Nazi demonstrators in Orlando, Gov. Ron DeSantis. It’s that simple. Say they are abhorrent. Say they are despicable. Say they have no part in this society or this state. But no,” the board wrote. When DeSantis “had his chance to condemn these demonstrators, when he could have simply said Nazis are bad people, when he could have made sure he didn’t give cover to those who hate, well, he didn’t,” it added. “And all the manufactured anger at Democrats can’t cover up that telling silence.” Read the full editorial here.
