1/12/2022,"Unilever is frustrating its shareholders. Last year’s stock market “rally in everything” bypassed the consumer goods giant entirely. The shares fell by a tenth and, at £39.42, stand roughly at their level of five years ago, soon after the group adopted a supposedly energising cost-cutting and deal-making overhaul in response to its close encounter with Kraft Heinz’s financial engineers. There have been developments since then, such as the offloading of the low-growth PG Tips tea business a couple of months ago, but none has stirred excitement. Here’s fund manager Terry Smith, explaining to investors in his £29bn Fundsmith fund via his annual letter on Tuesday, why the stock was a bottom-five performer in the portfolio: “Unilever seems to be labouring under the weight of a management which is obsessed with publicly displaying sustainability credentials at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals of the business.”  Smith cited the row over Unilever brand Ben & Jerry’s refusal to sell ice-cream in the occupied Palestinian territories, but offered other examples: “A company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot. The Hellmann’s brand has existed since 1913 so we would guess that by now consumers have figured out its purpose (spoiler alert – salads and sandwiches).” Make up your own mind about the Ben & Jerry’s affair (note that its founders enjoy semi-autonomy under the Unilever umbrella), but Smith’s criticisms play into a general sense that Unilever has drifted back into comfortable mode. In reality, the corporate emphasis on “purpose” may not be the problem since it has always been part of Unilever’s make-up. Rather, it’s the failure to convert those “value” credentials, which are supposed to be a commercial advantage these days, into serious acceleration in the profits line. At the nine-month point last year, Unilever still showed underlying sales growth of 4.4%, so in the upper half of its totemic 3% to 5% range, but the share price underperformance versus its peers is striking. It can’t simply be explained by the fact that Nestlé has shifted mountains of pet food during the pandemic and Unilever isn’t in that game. It’s more a case of chief executive Alan Jope’s expansionary ambitions in areas such as nutritional supplements, plant-based food and e-commerce beauty products looking lacklustre and very long term. Unilever, by reputation, is a formidable marketing machine, but the pace of transformation feels pedestrian versus expectations set after Kraft Heinz was defeated. The lesson of that episode was that the best defence against interlopers who don’t share your values is a high share price. With a stock market value of £101bn, Unilever is surely out of range for would-be bidders these days but rumbling among shareholders carries its own dangers. Jope must know it goes wider than one fund manager. Others ask why Unilever’s rivals are better at sticking to their profit margin guidance, to which there is no simple answer. A couple of strong quarters might banish the doubters and restore faith in Unilever’s brand and distribution clout, which are the qualities that persuade Smith to stick with the investment. But it needs to happen. A pandemic and inflation in the price of raw materials do not make Jope’s life easy, but he is now in his third year in the job. It is the point at which he is expected to deliver more than purposeful mayonnaise. Heathrow never passes up an opportunity to grumble about travel restrictions and its regulatory lot, and, sure enough, its chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, was at it again as passenger numbers for 2021 were revealed to be 19.4m, lower than 2020 and less than one quarter of pre-pandemic 2019. On travel restrictions, Holland-Kaye may be winning the argument slowly, but he’s pushing his luck in warning about “a return to the Heathrow hassle days of the early 2000s” unless the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which sets landing charges, focuses on “an outcome that improves service, incentivises growth and protects affordable private financing”. Come on, the CAA, in its interim ruling last month allowed Heathrow to raise its charges by 56% to £30.19 per passenger from the start of this year. The final outcome is awaited in the spring but, if 56% is an approximate guide, the airport’s wealthy owners should count their blessings. In pursuit of revival, shareholders in every airline have already been expected to dig deep.",News/Business,Time for Unilever’s boss to deliver more than mayonnaise,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/11/time-for-unilevers-boss-to-deliver-more-than-mayonnaise
1/12/2022,"The Kremlin has said it sees “no significant reason for optimism” about diplomatic solutions for the Ukraine crisis, ahead of a meeting in Brussels between Russia and Nato’s 30 member states. As Moscow was playing down the chances for success at the negotiating table after initial US-Russian talks in Switzerland on Monday, Russian forces deployed near Ukraine conducted a live-fire military exercise involving 3,000 troops and tanks, in a clear rejection of US demands for a de-escalation in the region.  A Russian delegation will hold talks with Nato’s 30 member states on Wednesday, in the first Nato-Russia Council meeting to be held since 2019. The idea behind the talks is to broaden the bilateral discussion begun by the US deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, and her Russian counterpart, Sergei Ryabkov, in Geneva. Sherman and Ryabkov pointed to the “useful” and “professional” nature of the Geneva talks, in which the US proposed reciprocal confidence-building measures limiting missile deployment and military exercises in Europe. But Ryabkov said the negotiations made no progress towards fulfilling Vladimir Putin’s central demand: for a guarantee that Ukraine will never become a Nato member, and that US troops and equipment would be withdrawn from former Soviet bloc countries in eastern Europe which are now in Nato. “So far, let’s say we see no significant reason for optimism,” the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters, adding that Russia was looking for quick results and would make an assessment of progress at the end of the week, following the Nato talks and a meeting on Thursday, of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is due to hold a press conference on Friday. “There are no clear deadlines here, no one is setting them. There is just the Russian position that we will not be satisfied with the endless dragging out of this process,” Peskov said. The US has firmly rejected the key Russian demands on Nato enlargement and troop withdrawals from eastern European countries which joined the treaty after 1997 as “non-starters”. Julianne Smith, the US ambassador to Nato, said Russia would get the same response from all members of the alliance on Wednesday. “In our prior consultations and meetings with allies … it has become crystal clear that not a single ally inside the Nato alliance is willing to budge or negotiate anything as it relates to Nato’s open door policy,” Smith told reporters. “I cannot imagine any scenario where that is up for discussion.” As for Nato returning to its old posture before it began its eastern enlargement in 1997, the ambassador said: “I think we’re operating in today’s world with Nato as it stands today, and I don’t think anyone inside the Nato alliance is interested in going back in time to revisit an era where Nato looked a lot different than it does today.” Kadri Liik, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the approaches followed by the US and Russia were fundamentally incompatible, with the US seeking to reduce the talks to technical arms control issues while Russia wanted to use them to redefine Europe’s whole security order. “In Moscow’s view the arms control agreements should follow the logic of the newly agreed order, not substitute for it,” Liik said. Whatever the outcome of this week’s diplomacy she predicted it would “likely shape Europe’s strategic landscape for many years to come”.",News/World news,Ukraine talks: Russia sees no grounds for optimism ahead of Nato meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/ukraine-russia-nato-talks-sergei-ryabkov
1/12/2022,"How much must Boris Johnson hate Michael Ellis? There again, how much must Michael Ellis hate Michael Ellis? It takes a special kind of person to volunteer to be the prime minister’s fall guy. Someone with even a trace of self-respect might have looked wistfully at the lateral flow test, inked on a second red line and made himself unavailable. Not the delusional Ellis. He was at his master’s beck and call: ready at all times to defend the totally indefensible in an act of imagined nobility. All he asked for in return was a knighthood for this and previous acts of slavish devotion to Johnson. It should, of course, have been Johnson who came to the Commons to answer the urgent question. After all, it was his party, in his garden, that he couldn’t remember attending. Short-term memory loss is beginning to look like the only excuse he has got. Feasible or not. But Boris has never been one to clean up his own shit. The MO of the Pikachu-lookalike with the toddler haircut has always been to generate chaos and let others take the rap. So brave.  But with Johnson holed up in the Downing Street flat and refusing to come out, it was Ellis, the junior minister with the non-job of paymaster general, who was forced to show his face. Again. Only last December, he had been made to answer a previous UQ on other Downing Street parties and that hadn’t gone well, with his oily disposition and evasive answers attracting widespread derision from the opposition benches. Tuesday’s performance was pretty much a re-run of the first. Only with even less credibility as no one in the chamber seemed in any doubt about Johnson’s guilt. Ellis began by saying how sorry he was that the “allegations had arisen”. Not that the party had taken place, while the rest of the country were obeying the rules and some were being denied a last goodbye to their loved ones. Just sorry that someone had seen fit to blow the whistle on the gathering. It was already getting downgraded from a party. But that was all he could say because it would be wrong to prejudge Sue Gray’s investigation. After all, it was possible that during the course of her inquiry she would find Boris had been doing something completely different from what everyone thought he had been doing and so accidentally exonerated him. So there was no point anyone bothering to ascertain the truth because there was a half chance that Gray might fall for whatever lies the prime minister eventually came up with. A few Labour MPs clapped ironically. None of which went down with Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader. Her voice was laced with equal parts anger and scorn as she demanded some proper answers. Had the prime minister been at the party or not? That was surely a binary question which it should be easy to answer without a formal investigation. “He can run but he can’t hide,” she said. Which was not strictly true. He can barely even walk these days. Rayner ended by asking if Ellis still believed the prime minister to be a man of honour. Astonishingly, Ellis did. Though no one else did. Not even the handful of Tories who had bothered to show their faces for the government’s total humiliation. Desmond Swayne wondered if the Downing Street parties showed that everyone would have been better off being allowed to do what they wanted all along. Christopher Chope wished that all the dirty linen had been washed in one go rather than drip fed. Duh! There’s way too much of it for that. Maria Miller rather timidly suggested that maybe the debate should have been delayed until Gray had been given a chance to have a memory lapse and exonerate Johnson, but that was about as good as it got for Ellis. “I have the full support of the government,” said the ever-so-oily Ellis, apparently unaware that the frontbench was entirely empty apart from a lone whip, who had been sent to keep him company and was doing his best to pretend he wasn’t there. From time to time, he looked pleadingly up at the speaker, desperate to be put out of his misery. Most UQs only run for 45 minutes, but for this one Lindsay Hoyle was prepared to make an exception and go into 30 minutes overtime. If Johnson wouldn’t turn up then he’d make his understudy suffer. It was a punishment beating, with opposition MPs quoting the fury of their constituents and asking questions to which Ellis could only recite the same useless non-answer. “It would be wrong to prejudge the inquiry,” he said time and again. And time and again, he would be told that all the house wanted was confirmation that Boris had been at the party. Surely Ellis had asked him that before he had agreed to cover up for him? “I couldn’t possibly disclose private conversations,” he said, grandly. At which point his last remaining shred of self-worth shrivelled up and died. He was now a mere carapace, masquerading as sentient life. Ellis was not the only one having a bad day defending Johnson. The junior health minister, Edward Argar, had drawn the short straw of the morning media round and had been unable to explain anything to anyone. Not even why Boris needed an inquiry to tell him what he had been doing. Mostly Argar was left talking nonsense before deciding enough was enough and it was time to cover his own back. He definitely had been to no parties. He had spent all the last two years on Zoom. He definitely knew nothing. The more he spoke, the less convincing he sounded. But the prize for real stupidity went to Tory backbencher Michael Fabricant. No one had asked him to help, obviously, because he’s a perennial liability. But he volunteered anyway. The party wasn’t a party, it was just a group of workmates having a party. Thud. The sound of one wig clapping. Boris was just bewildered to find so many people in his garden. Thud. They deserved a party because they had been working so hard. Thud. With friends like these... Still, at least we got one answer. For years, people have wondered what the point of Micky F was. Now we knew. To make third-raters like Ellis look smart.",News/Politics,Michael Ellis bends down and takes the party rap as PM stays in hiding,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/michael-ellis-bends-down-and-takes-the-party-rap-as-pm-stays-in-hiding
1/12/2022,"“Is this for real?” responded one Downing Street staff member to a party invitation from Boris Johnson’s private secretary at the height of the first lockdown. Sadly, shamefully, it was. The undisputed facts bear repetition. At the daily coronavirus news briefing on 20 May 2020, Oliver Dowden, then culture secretary, reiterated that Covid restrictions permitted individuals to meet just one person from outside their household. Barely an hour later, one of the prime minister’s most senior aides invited about 100 colleagues to a party in the Downing Street garden. Leaving no room for doubt as to the nature of the occasion, staff were told to “bring your own booze”. It seems that 30 to 40 people attended and the star guests, according to eyewitness accounts, were the prime minister and his now wife, Carrie.  After a month of denials and disingenuous evasion over “partygate”, this latest evidence of an outrageous breach of public trust takes Mr Johnson into new, exposed territory. In December, when a leaked video revealed Downing Street aides joking about how to explain away a Christmas party, the prime minister exuded faux-indignation and launched an inquiry. When this newspaper subsequently published a now notorious photograph of a garden gathering enjoyed by No 10 staff on 15 May 2020 – with the prime minister and his wife both present – the occasion was defended as an extended work meeting. But Martin Reynolds’ email invitation, sent five days later, allows little wriggle room for alibis or obfuscation and places the prime minister’s future on the line. This was clearly a party, and it therefore broke the law; Mr Johnson has failed to deny that he went to it, and it seems wholly implausible that it could have been organised without his consent, tacit or otherwise. As unprecedented sacrifices were being required of those unable to see dying relatives or attend friends’ funerals, Downing Street was treating the lockdown rules that Mr Johnson had set with contempt. Sent out to defend the indefensible in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the paymaster general, Michael Ellis, chided MPs for rushing to “prejudge” the ongoing inquiry into Downing Street “gatherings”, which is being conducted by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. She was drafted in to replace the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, when it emerged that a Christmas event had been held for members of Mr Case’s own private office. Ms Gray is now charged with ascertaining the facts regarding a party that Mr Johnson himself is alleged to have attended, and on which he has refused to comment publicly, before reporting them to him. This black farce brings politics into disrepute at a time when trust between the governed and the governing remains vital in the management of the pandemic. The millions of Britons who obeyed Covid rules, in often heartbreaking circumstances, can only rely on the respected Ms Gray to do her job rigorously. But the Metropolitan police should prepare to launch their own inquiry into a saga which has scandalised the nation and which now directly implicates the prime minister in wrongdoing. On the day that Mr Reynolds encouraged colleagues to congregate and enjoy the hottest day of the year, the Met tweeted a warning that, whatever the weather, the public was obliged to stick to the rules. Fines were issued to those who did not. No healthy democracy can allow the perception to take root that certain powerful people are above the law, least of all during a public health crisis of the first order. Yet this is what Mr Johnson has allowed to happen. The prime minister will hope to bluster his way through, as he has done so often before. But if he is found to have egregiously flouted the rules, and misled parliament, he should pay the price.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson and the Downing Street parties: a price must be paid | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/11/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-and-the-downing-street-parties-a-price-must-be-paid
1/12/2022,"This year’s Oscars ceremony will have a host after a three-year absence.  During the winter Television Critics Association virtual press tour, the ABC entertainment president, Craig Erwich, announced that March’s ceremony would see a return to the tradition without revealing who might be hosting. “You heard it here first,” he said before quipping that it could be him. The Academy awards last had a host in 2018 in the shape of Jimmy Kimmel before the following year was plagued by controversy after resurfaced homophobic jokes and tweets caused Kevin Hart to stand down. The 2019 telecast saw a rise in viewers, up from 26.6 million to 29.5 million but subsequent years have seen a consistent fall with 2021’s ceremony plummeting to an all-time low of 10.4 million. After last year’s Covid-affected ceremony was held at Union Station, this year will see the Oscars return to the Dolby Theatre. The Girls Trip and Ride Along producer Will Packer has been named executive producer for the night. “Will really has his pulse on popular culture and entertainment,” Erwich said. “I know he has a lot in store and we’ll have more details to share soon.” Fresh off the record-breaking success of Spider-Man: No Way Home, star Tom Holland recently expressed interest in hosting. “If they ask me to, I would, and it would be very fun,” he said to the Hollywood Reporter. “I would really enjoy it.” The Hollywood Reporter revealed that the Academy did then reach out to Holland. Last weekend saw The Power of the Dog and West Side Story come out on top at a subdued, star-free Golden Globes which wasn’t televised after the Hollywood Foreign Press Association was boycotted by publicity firms, celebrities and studios.

1/12/2022,"It is the United Nations’ biggest ever appeal for a single country. But the $5bn (£3.7bn) sought to stave off catastrophe in Afghanistan is dwarfed both by the trillions that were poured into the war, and by the level of current need. The Disasters Emergency Committee says that 95% of Afghans do not have enough to eat, and one million children are at risk of dying from malnutrition this winter. Women and other vulnerable people are especially hard-hit. The money is merely a stopgap, as the UN itself points out. Even if the appeal is fully funded – as it must be – the desperation will grow. Conditions will only worsen as winter intensifies, remaining possessions are sold and flimsy social safety nets break: even the relatively lucky are struggling, leaving them less able to help family and friends.  The Taliban’s seizure of power last August brought economic collapse, and drought has exacerbated the crisis. One UN expert believes that no modern economy has experienced such an abrupt shock, with the overnight loss of foreign aid amounting to 43% of GDP. Work and salaries disappeared. The price of essential imports such as wheat surged. Asset freezes and sanctions have deepened the crisis. The Taliban’s repression has left women jobless: “While we are living under the poverty line, the statements of [the]Islamic Emirate are about women’s hair and faces,” complained protesters in Parwan province last week. No one wanted the Taliban to take power, and no one wishes to reward a group who are immiserating and punishing their compatriots and dismantling democratic institutions, even as they demand foreign assistance. But while western governments ask themselves if they can deal with the Taliban, Afghans have no such choice. Humanitarian relief is essential but wholly inadequate. In late December, the US extended and clarified its waivers for aid, including development funding. This must be given too, but carefully. Though international donors have very limited leverage, strict monitoring and conditionality – such as ensuring that only services accessible to women are funded – is necessary. This will not be about grand deals, but the grind of daily negotiations. European nations have gone further than the US in a “humanitarian plus” approach, but Afghanistan cannot get off its knees without a functioning financial system. Unfreezing the assets of the central bank remains a highly controversial option, for obvious reasons, and it is unclear that the Taliban are capable of handling it anyway. Among the alternatives mooted are the creation of a private central bank or credit swaps, perhaps the quickest fix. Without a serious effort to shore up the economy, others will feel the consequences too: there is a significant risk that Islamic State could gain ground and that the production of narcotics will increase sharply. More people will be forced to flee into grim conditions. Above all, the appalling human toll in Afghanistan will rise steeply. Judging the best path ahead is extremely difficult. What is striking is how little serious effort is being put into it. A greater sense of responsibility by the US, and of urgency across the international community, is desperately needed.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Afghanistan: aid is not enough | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/11/the-guardian-view-on-afghanistan-aid-is-not-enough
1/12/2022,"Italian police have raided the homes of 15 young men and three boys who are suspected of involvement in a series of sexual assaults during New Year’s Eve celebrations in Milan. Nine women have so far reported that they were assaulted during celebrations in front of Milan’s Cathedral on Piazza del Duomo.  The case has prompted comparisons with the mass sexual attacks and muggings that took place in the German city of Cologne on New Year’s Eve in 2015-16. Police said the 18 suspects are aged between 15 and 21 and are foreign or Italian of north African origin. Raids were carried out early on Tuesday morning at homes in Milan and Turin. Several women, including two Germans who had been visiting Milan, came forward with their reports in the days after New Year’s Eve, with the number rising to nine as of Tuesday. Police believe more women were assaulted. Police identified the suspects based on CCTV images, the accounts of the victims and witnesses, as well as via the analysis of social media posts. The women shared similar stories of being dragged into the crowd, shoved and groped during the fireworks display. A 19-year-old woman alleged that she was set upon by a gang of youths at about 1.30am and attacked for about a minute before help arrived. Her friend managed to get away. The two German women said they were pushed up against barriers and sexually assaulted. They filed their reports after returning to Germany. One claimed the police didn’t respond to cries for help. In a video, the women can be seen trying to escape. “I realised they were touching me and we wanted to escape but there were too many of them,” one of the German women told the Italian news agency Ansa. “I hope they find them and that justice is done for us and all of the other girls that were molested that night.” One young woman suffered scrapes when her jumper was torn and trousers pulled down. She was taken to hospital by police for examination. Another was attacked on a street close to the square. The Italian interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, last week said that no effort should be spared in ensuring that such “deplorable behaviours” never happen again. However, the incidents have sparked a political debate, with rightwing parties calling for the city’s councillor for security, Marco Granelli, to be dismissed over the management of the New Year’s Eve celebrations. “The leftwing goodness, even in the face of the evidence, is really disgusting,” said Alessandro De Chirico, a councillor at Milan’s town hall from the Forza Italia party. The city’s leftwing mayor, Giuseppe Sala, condemned the “very serious attacks” that have besmirched the city. The case has drawn comparisons with the Cologne incident, when up to 1,000 young men, many of north African origin, carried out a series of sexual assaults, rapes and muggings close to the city’s cathedral. Cologne’s police were also accused of failing to respond to the attacks while a fierce debate erupted amid accusations of a police and media cover-up over fears of whipping up anti-foreigner sentiment in the wake of the migrant crisis in 2015. More than 1,200 women were attacked, 24 of whom said they were raped. The attacks were condemned by the then chancellor, Angela Merkel, as “abominable”.",News/World news,Police raid homes of 18 suspects over New Year’s Eve sexual assaults in Milan ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/police-raid-homes-of-18-suspects-over-new-years-eve-sexual-assaults-in-milan

Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP is based in Jersey and controlled by Howard, who is one of Britain’s richest men, via a Cayman Islands bank.  Its accounts show that the partnership earned fees of £169m for its in-demand services as an asset manager. It recorded a £130m profit after expenses, with a further £43m deducted to reflect the cost of the services and staff provided to the LLP by a related business. That left an £87m pot to be shared among the 17 members who own and operate the business, including Howard. The company distributed £79.8m of this in what it described as “contractual and discretionary profit allocations […] in consideration for services provided”. The highest-paid member received almost £55.8m, up from £29.9m the previous year. Howard stepped down as chief executive in 2019 but still acts as an investment manager for the company and is likely to be its highest-paid member. Brevan Howard, which serves wealthy clients from offices in London, New York, Geneva, Jersey, Hong Kong, Edinburgh and Singapore, declined to comment on the identity of the highest-paid member. Howard is the 107th richest man in the UK, according to the 2021 Sunday Times rich list, with assets worth £1.5bn. Electoral Commission records show that he has used his vast wealth to donate £352,854 to the Conservative party since 2019 alone, including a £250,000 gift made in December 2020. Howard has also been a frequent donor to charitable causes, including homelessness and Holocaust education. He has said that he prefers to keep a “low profile”. The former bond trader, 58, founded Brevan Howard in 2002 and the firm grew to become the world’s fourth-largest hedge fund within seven years, with £20bn under management. In autumn last year, it became the latest major global financial institution to announce a major push into cryptocurrency. The company said it would “significantly expand” BH Digital, a division devoted to cryptocurrency and digital assets, according to the Financial Times. At the time, Aron Landy, the fund’s chief executive, spoke of the “huge diversity of opportunities within the digital asset space and the significance of this to long-term macro investors”.

1/12/2022,"High-end delivery services are entering the Covid test market as demand for testing continues to soar in the US, with some pivoting to offer Covid tests alongside “wellness” products such as face creams or Botox injections. FastAF – a delivery startup serving San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York – is one such startup, with a business model offering “premium essentials” like CBD sparkling water, high-end skincare, and AirPods delivered to your door within two hours or less. The company, recently valued $200m, began selling at-home Covid tests about two weeks ago, according to the company. Under a “Covid-19 Home Tests & Essentials” page, the app lists an assortment of products: three different types of rapid tests, cold-pressed juice shots, masks, and several types of premium hand sanitizers (some costing up to $35.99 per bottle).  Two brands of Covid tests sold on FastAF, including Abbott’s BinaxNOW, have a sticker price of $39.99 – 67% higher than the typical retail price of $24. Still, in San Francisco, they sold out last week. Luxury wellness delivery services have also entered the Covid testing market. Drip Hydration – a company that delivers $299 IV treatments for issues like hangovers and food poisoning directly to your home in over 50 cities – is now offering in-home Covid testing. The company’s at-home Covid tests – which are nurse-administered – cost between $249 and $449. The company also offers Covid treatments such as a round of monoclonal antibody IV therapy ($999-$1,999) and IV bags of Super Immune Boost ($399), a blend of vitamin C, antioxidants, and zinc. “Well worth the cost to determine if I could end precautionary self-isolation and rejoin my family as soon as possible, especially given long wait periods for standard PCR tests in the Bay Area (it would have taken 5+ days to test and get results elsewhere),” wrote one Yelp reviewer from San Francisco. “Thank you Drip Hydration!” Velour Medical – which provides in-home Botox, fillers, and chemical peels – uses a similar model. The New York City-based company bills itself as providing “luxury cosmetic services and medical treatments”, and trained professionals administer either cosmetic facial fillers or nasal swabs to clients. One review on the site applauds the range of services: “I have used velour medical for concierge covid testing MANY times as well as for some (a lot) of Botox.” Amid a nationwide shortage of Covid-19 tests, the US government has tried to take various steps to keep rapid tests accessible. In a deal that expired last week, the Biden administration had two grocery giants commit to selling test kits “at cost” for $14. On Monday, the administration announced that, starting on Saturday, private insurers must cover the cost of eight at-home tests per month through in-network providers. And Americans are awaiting the distribution of 500m free at-home tests, though that process may take months to conclude. Meanwhile, US lawmakers from New York to California have warned against price-gouging for at-home tests. While premium test delivery services may not violate price gouging laws, they have raised questions about who can access testing at a time when US daily Covid cases are hitting record highs. “When there’s a profit to be made, you can count on American companies to step in,” Dr Bob Wachter, chief of medicine and an expert on Covid at the University of California, San Francisco, said in an email. Wachter anticipates that testing will become more accessible later this month as cases peak. “This seems like a brief potential windfall – I ordered tests on Amazon ($18/set) and they came in 3 days,” he added. “It seems like the federal intervention is likely to kick in soon as well. So I suspect this is a short-lived profiteering phenomenon, which will probably go away in a few weeks.” A spokesperson for Fast AF said the company marks up some of its products, which can be standard for middleman companies, but not all of them. “The value that FastAF shoppers receive comes from access to their preferred products and the convenience of rapid delivery, always in 2 hours or less,” said a FastAF spokesperson. “We try to price our service at a level which takes into account the cost of the supplies, the nursing, the dispatch, the clinical oversight, and at a level which allows us to retain good talent and pay our staff appropriately,” said Dr Abe Malkin, founder and CEO of Drip Hydration. Velour Medical did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.

1/12/2022,"On 20 May 2020 the UK was two months into its first lockdown, with many isolated and barred from seeing friends and family even in the most difficult circumstances. The news that a “bring your own booze” party was allegedly held in Downing Street on that day has been met by many with anger, but also a lack of surprise: it’s the latest in a series of similar revelations.  Five readers share memories of where they were on the day and how they felt when they heard the news. The day of the No 10’s “socially distanced drinks” has a particularly heavy significance for Laura Backhouse: it was the day of her husband’s funeral. He had died alone in hospital 10 days earlier, from leukaemia, at the age of 44. “Ten of us stood by his graveside, socially distanced, while the vicar said a simple prayer,” says Backhouse, a 41-year-old HR manager in York. Her children, eight and 10 at the time and attending their first funeral, were not allowed to “hug their grieving grandparents, who had lost their only child”. As wakes were not permitted at the time, the family “returned alone to [their] house to continue to grieve in solitude”. Backhouse says that at the time she found solace in the idea that everyone was in the same boat. “It was personally a very awful time, but the fact everyone was doing same thing was some comfort. We couldn’t have a proper funeral, but no one I know was breaking any rules,” she says. “Nothing surprises me any more, but it’s shocking that they thought [holding a party] was acceptable and no one spoke out at the time.” 20 May 2020 was 35-year-old Claire Mawson’s first day back home after being rushed into hospital for emergency spinal surgery. Mawson, a learning and development manager in Essex, was a new mother at the time, having had her baby less than a month before. “[My husband and I] weren’t allowed any members of family to come and help. I was unable to walk unaided and needed help using the bathroom all while caring for a three-week-old,” Mawson says. Had the UK not been in lockdown, “my mum, his mum, all of our friends and family would have taken it in turns to come look after us,” Mawson says. “That first day [home] was just so sad. I couldn’t hold my baby, I was just in bed not able to move. My husband was doing all the baby duties.” Recent revelations about government rule-breaking have hit Mawson hard. “It’s actually heartbreaking, to be honest,” she says. “A few weeks ago, I actually just sat down and cried to my husband, because I was just like, how can they do that? There’s people that have died, there’s families that haven’t been able to see their loved ones.” Mike, a chiropractor in Nottinghamshire, wasn’t surprised by the news. “It’s what, the seventh or eighth party that’s been declared?” the 52-year-old says. “But why are we only finding out about this now?” Mike was home schooling his children on 20 May 2020, during a lockdown that has had a sustained impact on his daughter’s mental wellbeing. “Her mental health crashed,” he says. “She needed social interaction with friends … it was against the law for us to take her to see a friend.” His daughter, 11 at the time, was stuck at home until schools partially reopened in June, but was “terrified” about moving to secondary school as “no visits were allowed to ease the process”. Mike adds: “Her mental health has not recovered.” On 20 May 2020, Pete, a 42-year-old theatre nurse in Swansea, was looking after Covid patients in intensive care. “We’d been trained to work in ITU to help with the workload, and we were in the ‘red zone’, face to face with Covid patients on ventilators,” he says, recalling the day of the No 10 party. Like many, Pete feels “furious” despite his lack of surprise at the news. “I’ve seen people say prayers over iPads, taken so many tearful phone calls from people,” he says. He’s mainly worried that attention will quickly move on: “In a few days, eyes will be turned elsewhere and this will be another ‘gaffe’ to add to the list. We’re all just shouting in the wind.” In Hertfordshire, Geraint Cooksley, 47, who leads a mapping and surveying team, remembers working into the night to a tight deadline on 20 May 2020. “It was a very long, hot, stuffy day. I did think at the time it was a shame we were all stuck in front of our computers, but didn’t mind too much as I had in mind that everyone else was in the same boat. “I thought, at least we’re all at work. I’d rather be doing this than being out of work, so let’s get through it. It was a day our team pulled together to get things done.” The leaked email “seems crazy”, says Cooksley. “We’ve all had to make sacrifices. So it feels like a real kick in the teeth that while people were keeping the country going, others were faffing around and doing what they liked, against the rules.”",News/World news,‘It was the day of my husband’s funeral’: readers remember 20 May 2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/we-thought-everyone-was-in-the-same-boat-readers-remember-20-may-2020
1/12/2022,"The former KPMG partner in charge of auditing Carillion’s accounts before its collapse has blamed his more junior colleagues for misleading regulators, as former team members turned on each other during a tribunal hearing allegations against the firm and six individual auditors. KPMG, one of the “Big Four” accountants that dominate the sector worldwide, on Monday admitted misconduct and apologised. However, a tribunal run by the accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), must also decide if any of the six individuals are guilty of misconduct. Five have denied all misconduct.  Carillion collapsed in January 2018, resulting in 3,000 job losses and causing chaos across hundreds of its projects – including building and maintaining primary schools, roads, and even Liverpool Football Club’s stadium, Anfield. The FRC alleges that KPMG misled its inspectors by forging documents in relation to the audit of Carillion and a software company, Regenersis. Carillion relied on major contracts, some of which proved much less lucrative than it thought.  Earlier this year it slashed the value of them by £845m, of which £375m related to major public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as Royal Liverpool University hospital.  As its contracts underperformed, its debts soared to £900m.  The company needed a £300m cash injection, but the banks that lent it money refused to put more in.  The government also refused to step in and bail the firm out.  That left the company unable to continue trading and forced it to go into liquidation. The 2016 Carillion audit was led by Peter Meehan, a partner at KPMG from 1998 until he was suspended in 2019 following an internal investigation. Meehan’s counsel, Ian Croxford QC, argued that there was no evidence that he was involved in a conspiracy to mislead the regulators, and that it was former colleagues who were responsible. “Mr Meehan placed his trust and confidence in those who were members of his audit team,” Croxford told the video tribunal on Tuesday. “He feels let down.” “He was the patsy, and he bitterly regrets that that is the case,” Croxford added, using the term for a person who is easily duped. Alistair Wright, a KPMG group senior manager working under Meehan, has already admitted “serious misconduct”. His counsel, David Turner QC, told the tribunal that Wright expressed “deep contrition” over misleading documents given to regulators and undermining public confidence in audits. However, Turner questioned the portrayal of Meehan as metaphorically “unseeing and anosmic” – meaning unable to smell – with regards to problems with the Carillion audit. None of the parties have disputed that the documents under question, including meeting minutes and a spreadsheet, were created and given to FRC inspectors. The FRC alleges the documents were designed to give a flattering picture of the work carried out by KPMG. What was Carillion? The Wolverhampton-based firm was second only to Balfour Beatty in size. It was spun out of the Tarmac construction business in 1999 and steadily took over rivals, such as Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine. It expanded into Canada and built a construction arm in the Middle East. Carillion then diversified into outsourcing, taking on contracts such as running the mailroom at the Nationwide building society to helping upgrade UK broadband for BT Openreach. It took over running public service projects, ranging from prison and hospital maintenance to cooking school meals. In 2017 a third of its revenue – £1.7bn – came from state contracts. It employs 43,000 people, with more than 19,000 in the UK.  Notable construction projects • GCHQ government communications centre in Cheltenham (2003) • Beetham Tower, Manchester (2006) • HS1 (2007) • London Olympics Media Centre - now BT Sport HQ (2011) • Heathrow terminal 5 (2011) • The Library of Birmingham (2013) • Liverpool FC Anfield stadium expansion (2016)~ • Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Smethwick (due 2019) • Aberdeen bypass (due 2018) • Royal Liverpool University Hospital (due 2018, behind schedule) Government contracts • NHS – managed 200 operating theatres; 11,800 beds; made 18,500 patient meals a day • Transport – “smart motorways” to monitor traffic and ease congestion; work on HS2; track renewal for Network Rail; Crossrail contractor • Defence – maintained 50,000 armed forces’ houses; a £680m contract to provide 130 new buildings in Aldershot and Salisbury plain for troops returning from Germany • Education – cleaning and meals for 875 schools • Prisons – maintained 50% of UK prisons. The FRC alleged that Richard Kitchen, who was an audit manager of Carillion, edited a key formula in the spreadsheet to increase a threshold for scrutiny of contracts from £300,000 to £1.5m. The change ruled out a large number of contracts that would have been flagged, and avoided uncomfortable questions on why more contracts had not been scrutinised, the FRC alleged. “The final version of the [spreadsheet] would have selected a far greater number of contracts for testing during the course of the audit,” said the FRC’s counsel, Nick Medcroft QC. “And so the increase of the threshold was a very useful mechanism to cut out a lot of these contracts.” Kitchen strongly denies all wrongdoing. His counsel, Fionn Pilbrow QC, argued that Kitchen was following Meehan’s directions, and that he did not knowingly make false representations to the regulators. The FRC made similar allegations relating to minutes that were missing from KPMG’s audit file, saying auditors had a motive to disguise the fact that documents had not been created during the audit. Missing documents would have been “great cause for concern about the quality of KPMG audit work”, the FRC alleged. KPMG, which is facing a £1bn claim in damages for alleged audit failures, argued that the tribunal can make no judgments on the quality of the Carillion audit, and that the problems highlighted were limited to the individual auditors. “There was no systemic problem, and none is alleged,” said Simon Brocklebank QC, KPMG’s counsel. The hearing is expected to continue over weeks of evidence. Two more former KPMG auditors deny misconduct. Stuart Smith, who was the partner in charge of the Regenersis audit, has reached a confidential settlement with the FRC. The FRC’s counsel has previously said he denied misconduct.",News/Business,Carillion tribunal: Former KPMG staff turn on each other,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/carillion-hearing-former-kpmg-staff-turn-on-each-other
1/12/2022,"Detectives investigating the disappearance of a teenage boy from South Yorkshire 14 years ago have arrested two men, aged 45 and 38, on suspicion of kidnap and human trafficking. Andrew Gosden was 14 when he left his home in Doncaster on a Friday morning, emptied his bank account of almost £200 and bought a one-way ticket to London. He was last captured on CCTV emerging from Kings Cross station.  South Yorkshire police on Tuesday said two men, aged 45 and 38, were detained in London on 8 December, with the help of officers from the Metropolitan police. The older of the two suspects was also arrested for allegedly possessing indecent images of children. Both have been released under investigation while inquiries continue. Gosden’s disappearance on 14 September 2007 became one of the country’s most high-profile missing persons cases. Police were not able to trace any of the boy’s movements after he was captured on CCTV at Kings Cross, but his family campaigned to keep their son in the public consciousness and to help the families of other missing people. They commissioned their own searches, including a sonar scan of the Thames, and issued images showing how he may have looked as he grew older. When Andrew went missing he was 5ft 3in, slim with light brown hair, with brown eyes on which he wore strong prescription glasses. He would now be 28, but his family have said he could be easily identified by an unusual double ridge on his right ear. “Our priority at this time is supporting Andrew’s family while we work through this new line of enquiry in the investigation,” DI Andy Knowles, from South Yorkshire police, said. “We are in close contact with them and they ask that their privacy is respected as our investigation continues. “We have made numerous appeals over the years to find out where Andrew is and what happened to him when he disappeared. I would encourage anyone with any information they have not yet reported to come forward.” A post on the campaign’s Twitter feed, which referenced a local newspaper story on the arrests, said on Tuesday: “It is a difficult time for Andrew’s family who currently know no more than what is written in the article. “Police investigations will be ongoing for quite a while and we respectfully ask you to give them your support and consideration whilst this takes place.”",News/UK news,Two men arrested over Andrew Gosden disappearance in 2007,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/two-men-arrested-over-andrew-gosden-disappearance-in-2007
1/12/2022,"A Chinese broadcaster has been ordered to pay the Premier League at least $213m (£156m) by the high court in London over the collapse of one of the competition’s most lucrative international rights agreements. The league terminated the deal last year after PPTV failed to pay two instalments of the rights fees owed, citing a change to the schedule caused by the 100-day pandemic-enforced pause in fixtures in 2020 and the lack of fans in stadiums when games resumed in June.  Given the season concluded eventually, the judge rejected the arguments made by the streaming service, which is owned by Suning, the Chinese retail giant that also controls the Italian champions Internazionale. “In many commercial contracts events may transpire other than as anticipated by one, or even both, contracting parties,” Judge Peter Fraser said in a ruling published on Tuesday. “That does not mean that the court will rewrite the parties’ bargain and impose different terms upon them to suit those later events. That is not the function of the law of contract.” The judge said the league payments of $210.3m and $2.673m should be made by the broadcaster‘s parent company, PPLive Sports International, along with interests and legal costs. The judge said in his ruling that the broadcaster had even “failed to pay a substantial amount of outstanding legal fees” owed to its lawyers last year. The Premier League said it welcomed the judgment. “The Premier League will robustly enforce its contractual rights when it has no other option available,” a statement said. “The league notes the judge’s view that PPLive had ‘no real prospect of success’ defending the claim. The bar is high for a summary judgment application and this decision highlights the strength of the league’s case. “The league will now begin the process of recovering the fees and costs owed by PPLive.”",Sport/Football,Chinese broadcaster PPTV ordered to pay £156m to Premier League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/chinese-broadcaster-pptv-ordered-to-pay-156m-to-premier-league
