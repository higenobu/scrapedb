3/20/2022,"There have been fire pits, pizza ovens and even inflatable hot tubs, but now the wood pellet barbecue is the object outdoor lovers are expected to queue up for in the days and weeks ahead as the weather turns warmer. Temperatures on Saturday reached up to 20C (68F) for the first time since October. The Met Office said the mercury hit 20C in Kinlochewe, north-west Scotland, with highs of 15.3C in Castlederg, Northern Ireland; 17.3C in Bridgefoot, Cumbria; and 18C in Valley, Anglesey. The warm weather is set to continue this week thanks to the jet stream tracking well to the north of the UK, letting high pressure dominate from the east. John Lewis says that wood pellet cooking has emerged as one of the fastest-growing sales areas in the outdoor cooking category because the grills are “as convenient as gas but match the flavour of charcoal”. The department store is stocking grills made by the upmarket US brand Traeger for the first time this year. The cheapest Traeger sold by John Lewis is £900 but for that price you are at least able to step away from the grill and socialise because it can be operated remotely using an app on your phone. Competition in the market includes brands such as Broil King and Weber but all come with a hefty price tag compared with a kettle barbecue, which can cost under £100. The past two years have seen Britons turn their outdoor spaces into “alfresco living rooms”, says Andrew Tanner, Habitat’s design manager. The supply of garden furniture was disrupted during the pandemic and this year shoppers are eager to get out in front, with sales of Habitat’s garden sets already double what they were this time last year. Customers are buying multi-purpose pieces that work indoors as well as out, Tanner added, especially quirky Instagrammable styles such as egg-chair swings and hammocks. The sales picture at household specialist Lakeland also shows people getting in the mood for the warm weather, with demand in the past week up for everything from £3 citronella outdoor candles to £35 festival-style festoon lights – to create outdoor atmosphere – and £700 Ooni pizza ovens. “We can definitely see people are planning on spending more time in the garden over the next few weeks, with sales of our outdoor ranges doing well,” said Wendy Miranda, its customer ambassador. It has also seen an uplift in sales of acrylic “crystal-look” glassware designed for use outdoors. The profile of consumer spending has changed dramatically during the pandemic as, with foreign holidays out of reach, an extra £500m was spent in DIY stores and garden centres in 2021. Britons also took up new pastimes: 1.2 million new gardeners spent an extra £51m on plants and related paraphernalia. The good weather is expected to spur the country’s legion of gardeners into action. Julie Murray, marketing director at the Notcutts chain of garden centres, said that customers were growing their own veg in increasing numbers as well as trying to attract more wildlife by creating insect hotels and bird boxes. “We are expecting people to be out in their garden this weekend,” said Murray. “If you are planning to grow your own this is the time for propagation to start. Lots of people will be buying feed or planting out potatoes.” But the sales trends detected by food retailers suggest that other people plan to just relax after a difficult winter. Ocado said searches for the word BBQ on its website were 60% higher last week than the one before, while the number of people searching for Pimm’s was up by about 30%. The same was true at Waitrose, where rosé wine sales were nearly 50% up on the previous week. Sainsbury’s was anticipating a run on barbecue fare such as burgers into the middle of next week with shoppers stocking up on ice-cream too.",Lifestyle/Food,"Grills, hammocks, pizza ovens … sun spurs alfresco shopping spree in UK",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/20/grills-hammocks-pizza-ovens-sun-spurs-uk-alfresco-shopping-spree
3/20/2022,"Sunflowers are one of those species that really do tick every box. Aesthetically, they are as showy and dazzling as they come. Practically, they are incredibly easy to grow, with really good resistance to drought and pests. Economically, you can grow dozens of them from seed for less than the price of a pint and, if you save the ones you grow, you can produce hundreds more the next year. Yet perhaps the reason they aren’t as popular as they deserve to be is that few people are aware of their enormous diversity, which goes far beyond the giant, yellow types that immediately come to mind. So here is my attempt to address that. Let’s start with one that couldn’t be further from the archetype of dinner plate-sized blooms of golden yellow. ‘Sun Fill Green’ has a cool mutation that has dramatically stunted its ability to produce petals, which makes the leafy-green sepals that normally remain hidden really come to the fore. Imagine a curious cross between an artichoke and a regular sunflower, creating a sort of exotic, emerald sea-creature look. With blooms held high on 180cm plants, they have the long stems that are perfect for flower arrangers and an enormous vase life. At the other end of the scale, ‘Teddy Bear’ has a genetic quirk that produces so many hundreds of tiny petals that its entire head is just a fuzzy mass of saffron yellow. It is so unbelievably textural that even people like me, who normally shy away from too much colour, can’t fail to be mesmerised. Growing slightly shorter, to around 150cm, this combination of it being smaller in stature, having a cartoon-character appearance and being a super-fast grower, makes it a great option for kids. If colour really is your thing, there is always ‘Black Magic’, which has deep claret-coloured petals, perfectly complementing their dark chocolate centres. One step further than that is the showstopping ‘Ms Mars’, whose rosy pink petals fade out slowly from dark red centres to pale pink tips in a dramatic ombré fashion. All of this on tiny plants that won’t grow more than 60cm high, which makes them perfect for patio pots or containers, or as quirky accents on the front of the border. Of course, one really simple way to dramatically change the appearance of sunflowers is not opting for genetic variants, but simply to grow them differently. Just pinching out the growing tip at the end of May will cause plants to redirect energy into side buds, creating stockier, branched plants with multiple smaller flowers, rather than towering specimens with single huge heads. Whatever you do, give the sunflower a go in a sunny patch this year. It’ll provide you with joy for months to come.

3/20/2022,"My dad died earlier this year. On the upside, we got a new cat. This may sound like a flip gag, and indeed it is, but it also isn’t. Let me explain. In the 1970s, fathers were not expected to show love to their children. Or indeed, much, to their wives. I grew up with my dad and three brothers in a house where familial affection, as we understand it now, was low in the everyday mix. However: we had a cat. She was called Phomphar. This name was my father’s idea, an onomatopoeic rendition of the noise she made when she was happy, which most people would call purring, but he called phompharing. This indicates something, which is that if my father did have a softer side, it was shown mainly to the cats. By softer side, what I mean is he would pick them up and aggressively sniff their heads and say “You’re a great beast – what are you? A great beast, yes you are!” But trust me, for Colin Baddiel, that was effectively a love sonnet. Cats, therefore, for me are a deep point of connection, with my childhood and with my now gone parents. There was very little beauty in my childhood – this is not a misery memoir-style statement, it’s just a true one about Dollis Hill, northwest London, in the 1970s – but Phomphar was beautiful. Of course she was. She was a cat. Now, luckily, I have a lot more beauty in my life, and a lot more softness and a lot less gruff, blunt maleness, but I am still utterly in thrall to the beauty of cats. I am a fundamental atheist, but when I look at one of my cats – I presently have four – curving like a Matisse in a shaft of sunlight, I believe in God. Some people on social media see me as the antichrist, but really, I am the anti-Zouma. I have never, since I was a child, not had at least one cat. Even when I was at university and living in halls of residence, I smuggled in a stray and fed it regularly. I also had one when I shared a flat with Frank Skinner. Frank is not a cat man, but he is very committed to comedy, and the name of the tabby who lived with us, arrived at after a short brainstorming session (mainly driven by his extraordinary punning ability) was Chairman Meow. There are not many hills I am prepared to die on, but that this is the best name ever for a cat is one. One proof is that it – the name, not the cat – was stolen soon after by Will & Grace. Another is that the first time I took her – Chairman was a her, unlike Zedong, although even if alive today and on Twitter, I doubt he’d have been that big on announcing pronouns – to the vet, and the receptionist asked for the cat’s name, it got in the crowded waiting room a massive laugh. Obviously, I was very pleased about this, except I noticed the receptionist just wrote down, on her computer, “Meow” – just, as if it were her surname. Which meant that when I went through to the actual vet and saw him glance at the information on his computer about this new cat, I could tell, from a raised eyebrow, that he was thinking “Meow” – what a shit name for a cat. Supposed to be a writer and comedian and he goes that unoriginal on a cat name? But it felt too late to explain. It isn’t, however, just about beauty, because cats are not just beautiful (although they really are: what other small animal is a perfect micro-copy of their big version? When I see Ron, my all ginger polydactyl – he has seven toes – boy, I just think: this is a lion cub. I basically live with a lion cub). Some of you may be aware that although my day job is still, nominally, comedian, late in my career I’ve been pulled into a type of activism, where I spend much of my time trying to redress various negative stereotypes and myths and bad imaginings that surround a long-maligned group. It may be time however for me to move on from Jews, to cats. I have got to the age now where the only jobs I want to do are ones I know I’m going to actively enjoy, so I recently suggested to a TV production company, who were keen to hear my ideas, a show called David Baddiel: Cat Man. The idea being that I – the person in the title – would go round the country visiting people with extraordinary and characterful cats, and they would show me the cats being extraordinary and characterful. That’s it. I can’t think of a show I’d love to do more. But what the TV company got back when they pitched this idea to broadcasters was: cats? Extraordinary and characterful? They just sit around preening themselves. They’re all the same. Now, dogs… There’s a number of things wrong with this attitude. First, it’s wrong. I mean, it’s just a priori wrong. Cats have won. In the eternal battle between them and the barking, snappy ones as to who humans prefer being around, there is no doubt that first place has gone to the felines. People who don’t accept this will point to the fact that in the UK, there are still slightly more dog-owners than cat ones, but these are analogue people who presumably have never heard of the internet. In 2015 – these are the figures I can find, now it will be 10 times that – there were more than 2m cat videos on YouTube, with an average of 12,000 views each, a higher average than any other category. So from the point of view of what animals people like to watch and look at on their screens, these TV commissioners genuflecting reflexively towards dogs are just incorrect. Secondly, it’s wrong. Because cats don’t pander to humans, that doesn’t mean that they are inexpressive. I’ve really had a lot of them, and each one has been very different and absurdly idiosyncratic. Pip, Ron’s mother, is often lazy and irritable, but will come over all kittenish and adorable if my wife sings her, at a particular pitch, Only You by Yazoo. Chairman Meow would stick her tongue out at you if you ran your fingers over a comb. Tiger, Ron’s brother, will grab your attention by tapping you gently on the arm with his paw, which is not unusual in and of itself, but he often becomes uncertain about the tap on the way to the tapping moment and so just stays with his paw poised in the air staring at you in hope and confusion, which is so cute it makes me want to die. These are just the tips of the various icebergs of personality that a few of the cats I’ve owned display. Yes, there are some issues with cat ownership. Recently, I went to watch Chelsea play a midweek game and, because I’d be getting back quite late, decided to cook dinner (monkfish in teriyaki sauce) before leaving, thinking, “I’ll just pop that in the microwave when I return.” I left it in the pan, covered with a bowl and a cake mesh. When I got home, they’d eaten it. Pip, Ron and Tiger had combined so well – presumably they thought, “That’s nice, not only has he left us a meal, he’s set it up as the prize at the end of an entertaining obstacle course” – leaving the bowl and the cake mesh so neatly next to the pan, that I assumed the heist must have been perpetrated by a human. So I accused my teenage son, who professed he hadn’t done it and that the cats were clearly trying to frame him. And he was right. But the thing is, I’m always going to forgive them. We take our cats on holiday, and Ron once went missing in the attic of a house we were renting on the day we were meant to leave. I spent three hours searching among the lung-eroding insulation and dust up there for him. By the time I caught him, we were late, probably going to have to pay a fine, and I was sweating with anxiety. But the minute I saw his face, I still thought: “Ahhh, Ron.” Cats are not selfish. They are selves, complete, rounded, rich and strange characters, but the idea that they have no empathy – a mistake humans make about animals in general, all part of human exceptionalism, which is what allows us to keep them as pets, but more importantly, eat them – is deeply mistaken. Monkey, a male cat who I gave to my wife when we first got together – I acknowledge this is a bit presumptuous, I mean, a cat’s not just for a one-night stand, he’s for life, or at least, a long chapter within serial monogamy – was one of the nicest beings I’ve ever known. Once, he appeared upstairs in Morwenna’s study, meowing and meowing. Eventually she got up and he led her downstairs – to where one of our other cats had got his paw stuck under the door. Put that in your well-where-a-child-has-fallen-down and smoke it, Lassie. Pip is not so nice. She is a grand matriarch and extremely territorial. But she is my daughter Dolly’s cat, chosen by her from a litter we found on Gumtree when she – Dolly – was seven. Elsewhere, Dolly and I have talked about the fact that she has suffered from an eating disorder. When things have been really bad with my daughter, when she has been at her lowest ebb, without fail, Pip has somehow known, and appeared, and tried – and sometimes, succeeded – to comfort her. It’s unbelievably moving to watch. On which note. My father’s affection for cats stayed with him even as almost everything else he knew about himself went. He had two living with him in his last years. After his death, we took in one of them, Zelda, originally Pip’s daughter. We brought her back to her place of birth, and reintroduced her to her family, which really didn’t turn out like Surprise! Surprise! Unless I missed that episode of Surprise! Surprise! where a mother growled and hissed at her long-lost daughter and then chased her under a cupboard. But Zelda turns out to have her own personality. She is neat and complex, and eager for human company, so likes to visit us in our bedroom at night. It turns out there’s nothing more reassuring, when you wake in the night, perhaps tormented by the recent shocking absence of your parent from this world, than feeling the soft weight of his cat on you, and hear her gentle phompharing.

3/20/2022,"Cohesion became a buzzword recently after a certain opposition coach used it while talking up Ireland. For all that Scotland exploded out of the traps on Saturday, it was the inner workings of Ireland’s system that proved more durable. Ultimately, a third straight bonus-point win could not prevent France from claiming the title. “There’s so much more left in us,” said the Ireland captain Johnny Sexton, looking forward to next year’s World Cup. “We’re going to have be a lot better over the next year and a half.” The notion that Ireland fail to peak at World Cups has become both a cliche and a constant fear for their supporters. Rewind to 2006, and Irish chests were puffed out after autumn victories against Australia and South Africa. The following year, when the World Cup in France rolled around, a team studded with players in the class of Brian O’Driscoll and Ronan O’Gara failed to progress from the pool. Ireland are again admirably well-resourced on the field, and again faced with a difficult group centred on Paris. Stade de France meetings with the champions, South Africa, and Scotland await. Will Ireland be on an upward trajectory when they kick off against Spain in Bordeaux next September? This summer’s three-Test tour of New Zealand will help to develop a vibrant style that accounted for the All Blacks last November. “It’s massive,” said the head coach, Andy Farrell, of the summer tour. “It’s the perfect opportunity that the group need … Going to New Zealand, there’s no pressure like it, so it’s a perfect opportunity to find out more about ourselves.” Farrell’s side are increasingly finely tuned: backs and forwards alike comfortable offloading, an enviable collective ability to generate quick ruck ball, with intelligent running lines across the field. They are also lethal when driving off attacking lineouts, evidenced by Cian Healy’s first-half try. Ireland finished strongly but it was a somewhat disjointed tournament. After dismantling Wales in Dublin, the unsurpassed brilliance of Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack, along with French pack’s crushing power, proved too much in Paris. Ireland recovered impressively having trailed 22-7, eventually losing by six. The round-three victory against 13-man Italy was useful learning in one sense: collectively Ireland failed to deal with a radical departure from the expected script. Farrell may suspect there is work to be done on the team’s ability to adapt, especially considering they went on to labour against another depleted opponent at Twickenham. Despite Charlie Ewels’ early red card, the Irish scrum suffered at the hands of a fired-up England. The first-choice front-rows Andrew Porter and Rónan Kelleher are missing, however, so perhaps that can be seen as an off day rather than a chronic problem. The full-back Hugo Keenan and centre Garry Ringrose are two members of Ireland’s back division who are beginning to excel at international level. Ringrose’s reading of the game, in particular, is significant and Keenan’s heroic try-saving tackle on Stuart Hogg was an accurate reflection of his ability. Sexton, meanwhile, will be 38 by next September. His celebration of the late bonus point-clinching try illustrated his enduring hunger. The Leinster fly-half says he wants to avoid going out “with a whimper” and a potential World Cup quarter-final against France or New Zealand will give him every opportunity. Asked if this is the strongest Ireland squad he has been involved with, he said: “We’ve got great potential, haven’t we? That’s what we have at the moment. We’ve got to make it reality, we’ve got to keep building over the next 18 months. “We’ve taken a slightly different approach, we’ve started talking about it already, that this is the journey. It’s a different approach to the previous management that I’ve worked under, and I think it’s the right way to do it.” For Scotland, after the euphoria of the opening win over England at Murrayfield, their considerable promise again remains unfulfilled. They have all the ingredients, and Rory Darge is the latest eye-catching product of their back-row talent factory. Hogg’s decision to ignore his teammates before being shoved into touch by Keenan is not the sort of mistake that he, or his team, can afford when they meet Ireland in Paris next October.",Sport/Sport,Farrell’s finely tuned Ireland machine put down marker for World Cup | Luke McLaughlin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/20/farrells-finely-tuned-ireland-machine-puts-down-marker-for-world-cup
3/20/2022,"Soft toys wearing face masks, drawings of hand sanitiser and secret dens under tables: a new academic study of children’s play during the pandemic has revealed the comforts and the traumas of the past two years. The research, conducted by University College London and Sheffield University, demonstrates how the young have attempted to cope with, and even to control, the changed world around them. “We were amazed by the variety of play,” UCL’s Prof John Potter told the Observer. “We’ve been able to compare the creative things children did during previous national crises, such as the Spanish flu pandemic and the second world war. Many enduring traditional children’s games date from those moments.” The gathered findings, including photographs and art, poetry and videos that were submitted from all over the world to the Play Observatory website, are now to become part of an exhibition curated by Young Victoria and Albert, the new incarnation of London’s former Museum of Childhood in Bethnal Green. The exhibition will open online on 23 March, the two-year anniversary of the first lockdown, and the physical exhibits are expected to move to the new museum site in 2023. “We saw a strong desire from children to control their own spaces, with a huge amount of den-building. Perhaps this is unexpected when children were already being kept inside in limited spaces, but a den under a blanket or a dining table can give a greater feeling of security and power over their own environment.” Other submissions include a seven-year-old’s “pretend virus-free hairdressers” and Barbie dolls participating in Joe Wicks’s online exercise class. Rituals of hand-sanitising and hand-washing also became formalised into songs and games. There was clear evidence that the first lockdown, which took place in spring, had been easier for most children. “Going outdoors allowed children to explore their neighbourhood in new ways. The second lockdown was worse, but children showed a great level of ingenuity,” Potter said. Play specialists from Great Ormond Street hospital advised on the project. “Not every child had such a good play experience, of course,” said Potter. “We should not forget that some were overwhelmed by anxiety and felt very restricted.” Submitted photographs feature chalked “Keep out” signs on the pavement and images of a virtual Minecraft funeral a child created when he was unable to attend in person. There are also pictures of toddlers Covid-testing their teddy bears and creating face coverings for hospital role play. Displayed next to the drawing Germs and Hand Sanitiser, by four-year-old Cadi from Pontarddulais, Swansea, is the Young V&A’s Study of a Gas Mask, made between 1939 and 1942 by Byron Dun, aged between 11 and 14 at the time. “This project has enabled us to move the discussion on from ‘learning loss’ as the only effect of the pandemic on childhood, and given us a chance to reflect on how children may respond now and in the future to crises and emergencies,” Potter said.",News/World news,Exhibition gives insight into children’s play in lockdown ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/exhibition-gives-insight-into-childrens-play-in-lockdown
3/20/2022,"Elon Musk has a net worth of $220bn – rounded off nicely by a bounty of government subsidies. Yet he has not taken cues from any of his billionaire peers. Jeff Bezos rarely ever shows his face on the internet, Bill Gates defers most of his public statements to his charity and Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t even have a Twitter account. But Musk has never been able to overcome a need for attention that churns away at the core of his being. He has been offered an incredible pedestal by his wealth, and he is committed to use it as obnoxiously as possible. By now we’ve become accustomed to his blend of churlish gamer patois and casual prejudice. In the past week on Twitter, Musk has challenged Vladimir Putin to one-on-one combat, derided the Ukrainian solidarity campaign as a movement for sheeple and alluded to the idea of moving to Mars by 2029. Only two weeks ago, Musk was promising satellite internet support to those trapped in Kyiv, but as the wind blows, so does the bluster. His ethical tentpoles don’t last for long, because he hasn’t given them much thought in the first place. Now he believes supporting Ukrainians is some kind of woke cause célèbre. He’s speculating that Netflix will commission a series starring a “Black Ukraine guy” and a “transgender Russian soldier”. In another post sheathed in repellent 4Chan iconography, an “NPC” – the meme representation of a brainwashed, CNN-addled liberal – brandishes the Ukrainian flag, against a background that contains flags of other causes including transgender pride and the LGBTQ+ rainbow. “I support the current thing,” it reads – suggesting that people who feel horrified at the brutal deaths of thousands of Ukrainians are only doing so as some kind of political trend rather than basic human instinct. There is an idiom people repeat about American presidents: that the pressures of the Oval Office tend to reveal the fundamental character traits of its current occupant – that same logic applies to Musk. This is a man who has directed much of his enormous capital to pulpy sci-fi schemes. He hopes to colonize Mars, he wants to build hundred-mile tunnels deep in the Earth’s crust, he believes that we may be living in a simulation. It’s a portfolio that would make the most inveterate Redditors on the internet proud, so is it any surprise that when a genuine humanitarian crisis spreads across Ukraine, Musk treats it like a video game? One which ends up with Musk in a big final-boss martial showdown against Vladimir Putin. Musk’s latest agitation coincides with yet another bizarre chapter in his personal life. Last week, the Canadian musician and Musk’s on-and-off partner, Grimes, revealed that the couple had a second child together in December. (Her name, of course, is Exa Dark Sideræl Musk.) Grimes also confirmed that the pair had since broken up, and reports quickly leaked that she was in a relationship with the whistleblower Chelsea Manning. It probably isn’t a coincidence that Musk retorted with a transphobic meme on his timeline. His brand is a toxic milieu of personal grudges, retrograde politics and old-fashioned mean-spiritedness. (Remember when Elon Musk slandered the diver who rescued the 12 boys trapped in a Thai mine as a pedophile, after he dismissed help from the billionaire?) He posts with the same motivation as the teenage boys who look to get a rise out of each other in the bowels of the most vengeful forums on the internet. The morbid difference is that Musk has accumulated enough money to wield genuine global influence. Elon Musk is far from the only grotesque rich guy in our society. Browse through the rogues gallery of NFL franchise owners or intercontinental energy barons and you will discover plenty of bleak tales, for there is nothing scarier than a man who has the power to actualize all of their ghastly quirks and tics. (Consider: Donald Trump’s golden toilet, or David Geffen isolating on a superyacht during the darkest days of Covid.) But Musk is the only one who routinely pulls the curtain back, revealing that behind all of the rich public loans and seed funding ventures, there is a CEO who has insulated himself against reality. Still, it’s ominous to watch Musk gleefully double down on his shallow, Q-baiting rhetoric, particularly after Americans just witnessed a presidential term where a man seized power by consolidating the angry, paranoid propulsion of the internet. It’s all feeling very familiar.",News/Technology,"Memes, grudges and moving to Mars: the week in Elon Musk | Luke Winkie",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/20/the-week-in-elon-musk-memes-grudges-mars
3/20/2022,"After the tonal uncertainties of his English-language western flop The Sisters Brothers, French writer-director Jacques Audiard finds himself back on home ground with this intertwining tale of love and desire in the digital age. Having earned Baftas for the neo-noir The Beat That My Heart Skipped (2005) and the bone-shaking A Prophet (2010) and won the Palme d’Or with the gripping Tamil-refugee drama Dheepan (2015), Audiard is in altogether more incidental spirits for this bittersweet affair, which flirts with the modern romcom genre while cheekily flipping the themes of Eric Rohmer’s My Night With Maud. The imposing towers of the Olympiades, the high-rise neighbourhood in Paris’s 13th arrondissement from which the film takes its French title, provide the backdrop for an elusively chaptered roundelay of stories. First, we meet Émilie (Lucie Zhang), a Chinese-French science graduate who, despite her qualifications, is kicking her heels in menial jobs such as telesales and waitressing. Émilie’s apartment belongs to her grandmother, who has Alzheimer’s and is now living in a nearby nursing home. Yet Émilie rarely visits, even assuaging her guilt by asking a supposed doppelganger to act as her stand-in, convinced her gran won’t know the difference. As for her mother’s phone calls from Taiwan, Émilie cuts them short, keeping everything at a distance. When teacher Camille (Makita Samba) presents himself at Emilie’s door as a potential rent-paying flatmate, the pair almost immediately fall into bed. Emilie is smitten, the arrogant Camille less so. “We’re not a couple,” he says before bringing home another lover, blithely declaring that “attraction fades” and that: “You’re in love; I’m not.” Next, via an apparently brief detour into the startlingly colourful sex-cam world of Amber Sweet (Jehnny Beth), we hook up with Nora (Portrait of a Lady on Fire star Noémie Merlant) who has moved from Bordeaux to pick up her studies in Paris. “I can see the Seine from my window!” she says delightedly before heading to class, where the younger students react dismissively to her thirtysomething presence. Later, a party wig causes Nora to be mistaken for Amber and she promptly finds herself the subject of mobile-phone-powered sex-shaming ridicule. So grotesque is the experience (which Audiard stages with near-gothic inflections) that Nora abandons her studies and becomes an estate agent, a twist that brings her into contact first with the ever-seductive Camille and then, more importantly, with Amber, who proves to be an unexpected soulmate. Audiard describes the stories of American graphic novelist Adrian Tomine from which he drew inspiration as being “filled with whimsy and melancholy”. The same is true of the film, for which Audiard called upon Céline Sciamma, creator of such flawless gems as Girlhood and Petite Maman, and Léa Mysius, who made 2017’s Ava, to collaborate on the screenplay. Crisply photographed by Paul Guilhaume, and presented in a romantic urban monochrome that recalls the vistas of Manhattan, this is a playfully sensuous affair that wonders what happens to slow-burn intimacy when mediated by the urgency of the online world. Mobile phones and computer screens are constant companions, bringing people together in strange and unexpected ways, whether it’s the dating apps that Émilie uses to feed her immediate needs or the pay-per-view porn sites through which Nora ironically finds a human connection. Crucially, there’s nothing judgmental about the script, which takes pleasure in confounding technophobic expectations. While digital communication may allow everyone to live in their own isolated box, it’s interesting how many of the film’s most genuinely intimate moments play out at one remove. In one scene, a couple “sleep together” thanks to the miracle of web-cam technology. In another, the thrill of a repeated declaration of love is amplified by being delivered down a door-intercom phone. Hats off to the ensemble cast for making these highly choreographed shenanigans seem as natural as they do and to French electronic music composer Erwan Castex, AKA Rone, who was joint winner of the best soundtrack award at Cannes last year and who provides the bittersweet beat to which Audiard’s film skips.",Arts/Film,"Paris, 13th District review – a compelling portrayal of relationships in the digital age",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/20/paris-13th-district-review-a-compelling-portrayal-of-relationships-in-the-digital-age
3/20/2022,"Alittle after 11pm at a euphoric sweat-sodden Stade de France, the lights finally went out on this remarkable French side. The stadium was plunged into darkness, fireworks danced across the Paris sky and in the stands 75,000 fans danced with them. Through the pitch-black night, Antoine Dupont and his teammates peered upwards to enjoy the spectacle. The song playing over the speakers was Freed From Desire, and after 12 long years France have finally been freed from theirs. It was brutal and it was draining and perhaps we should have expected nothing less. France’s grand slam was not just a victory for the 23 men in blue, or even for the nation they represent, a nation that has shed its thick cloak of scepticism and indifference and learned to love this team again. In many ways it was a victory for modern rugby itself, for valour and entertainment, for the idea that a team can be both art and science, discipline and invention, structure and chaos, past and future. Yet the real gift of this side have been to escape the burden that has weighed down so many of their predecessors: the noise, the comparisons, the chain-mail of nostalgia. It was not a perfect performance by any stretch of the imagination. It was downright scruffy in parts, pock-marked by errors and missed opportunities. But through it all France never really seemed to relinquish their control or their composure. They counterattacked with purpose, trampled all over the rucks, largely succeeded in playing the game in the areas where they wanted to play it. They slowed and quickened the game to their own liking. There was no better example of this than their crucial try just before half-time, when they pounced on an England side already going through the motions with lightning shift of pace. On ITV at half-time, England’s star-studded alumni tried to analyse the game from an English point of view, when in fact there was cherishably little to analyse. Aside from a few choice segments, England were barely allowed to play. “To infinity and beyond,” read the headline in L’Équipe on Saturday morning. And there has been a certain surreal quality to France in this tournament, the sense of a team still unsure of their own outer limits, still young and stupid enough to believe they can do anything, beat anyone. To single out individuals is almost to defeat the entire point of this side, but aside from the lavish plaudits for Dupont and Melvyn Jaminet a special mention should be reserved for François Cros in the back row, hustling and foraging and tackling as if possessed by the spirit of Thierry Dusautoir. Even the grizzled veterans swore that this was the finest atmosphere they had ever heard at this stadium. The Paris crowd is occasionally accused of being a fair-weather audience, but it was the fairest of weathers as France coughed up an early lead. Uini Atonio put a humongous shove on Ellis Genge and produced the first points. Gregory Alldritt, one of the players of the tournament, put down a marker by jackalling the ball out of Maro Itoje’s hands as if it were the last Christmas turkey in the Asda freezer. The front door was locked, and despite a couple of fine aerial claims by Freddie Steward there was little joy around the back either. France started to motor, and even if amid the odd handling error there was the utter assurance that another opportunity would come sooner or later. In the stands Fabien Galthié looked serene and composed in his thick-rimmed glasses and designer headphones, like a man who had just dropped the Eurodance track of the year. England had a good spell. But then so did Ireland, and so did Wales. Each time the French defence simply dug in, held firm, minimised the damage. The finishers rose from the bench to shut down the game: Mohamed Haouas and Romain Taofifénua both had a decisive role in Dupont’s game-clinching try, an irresistible attacking move in which England quickly found themselves choking, floundering, drowning in flesh and blue shirts and pure human desire. And so, as the fireworks studded the night like diamonds and France reeled and revelled, it was tempting to peer into the future. The current side may feel like a perfect storm of good coaching, good players and sensible governance, but these phenomena are scarcely aligned for long. The 2010 team arguably peaked a year early, surging to the 2011 World Cup final on a wave of resentment and internal dysfunction. The 18 months between now and the next World Cup will be laden with expectation. Tough times await. This team will now have a target on their backs. But you don’t have to be a French partisan to be fascinated by where this team might go next.",Sport/Sport,Paris savours a France team worthy of gracing the city of light | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/20/paris-savours-france-team-worthy-of-gracing-the-city-of-light
3/20/2022,"Tom Burgis is investigations correspondent at the Financial Times and author of Kleptopia (William Collins) There lived a man whose land was rich with oil and gas but who grew up surrounded by poverty and knew every day that things could, and periodically did, fall apart. He joined the security forces then entered public service. That is the wrong term: he began to participate in the looting that is the incessant occupation of those who hold public office in his country. This became his life’s work, to remain an insider, not to tumble from the enclave of wealth and safety into the turbulent world outside. He grew rich. He rose. He grew richer. So did those on whom he bestowed his favour, those he licensed to loot. They fawned over him, told of his greatness. As for the rest, those in whose name he ruled, there was no need to seek their consent. Instead, to maintain control, he fed them fear while promising the antidote. They are coming, the others, those who wish us harm, wish to take what we have, but I will keep you safe. It was a double life: he was at once the thief and the guard. The man I have in mind was the governor of a Nigerian state. As he guzzled petro-dollars, villages burned in his name. But this sketch applies, with only minor variations, to many of the world’s rulers. From the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Kazakhstan, most countries’ principal way of making money in the global economy is by selling its basic ingredients: fuel, metals precious and industrial, certain stones. The proceeds are at the disposal of whoever holds power. They take what they want, then hire bankers and lawyers to remove their fingerprints from the loot and stash it in rich countries. They have no need to raise taxes from their own people, so their own people have no way to call them to account. Corruption is the opposite of consent. Vladimir Putin’s eligibility for this club of kleptocrats comes across in First Person, a book written by three Russian journalists shortly after Putin became president in 2000, based on interviews with him, his wife and some of his friends. Growing up with rats and abysmal toilets, Putin dreamed of a place in the Soviet empire’s boss class as an officer in the organisation that protected its power, the KGB. One Easter, Putin, then a young recruit, was policing a religious procession outside a church. “He asked me,” a cellist friend recalls, “whether I wanted to go up to the altar and take a look. Of course I agreed. There was such boyishness in his gesture – ‘nobody can go there, but we can.’” Later, a drunk student asked to bum a cigarette. Putin, a judo champion, said no, then flung the student to the ground. Power is for getting things others cannot have; if others ask for something you do not wish to give, respond with violence. Posted to Dresden, Putin lived with his young family in a serviced apartment. There was a driver, good beer, hotdogs in the countryside at weekends. Then the Berlin Wall fell. Angry crowds massed outside the KGB station. He contacted his commanders and was told: “Moscow is silent.” The old order had fallen; he needed to join the new one. He went home to St Petersburg and secured a position in the local government with powers to decide who was allowed to make money by dealing with western capitalists. Naturally, he decided that this should be him and his cronies. He rose. Within a decade, he was president. He took his gang of kleptocrats with him to the Kremlin. (Some of them, such as Igor Sechin, are now on sanctions lists.) The rulers of the west applied the same logic to Putin as they applied to the rulers of DRC or Kazakhstan. They wanted to buy these countries’ commodities so they pretended the kleptocrats were legitimate leaders with whom they could do business. They kept this up when he murdered exiled dissidents abroad, when he stole South Ossetia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014, all the while developing a tribal imperialist spiel to stir fealty at home. After 22 years of this, Putin evidently believes his own propaganda that he is a statesman, rather than a character from The Godfather. As his forces devastate Ukraine, I asked a Russian former intelligence officer what Putin wants. “Respect,” he said. “It’s all about respect.”As well as accepting that we have so emboldened him that we may well have to meet him on the battlefield, to confront Putin’s kleptocracy, we must first cease our complicity in it. What do we think happens to the money we pay for Russian gas? How do we imagine western multinationals secure oil-drilling rights dispensed by a regime we know to be corrupt? Who do we think is behind the companies of anonymous ownership, registered in places like Guernsey, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands, that we continue to allow to participate in our economies? The Panama Papers revealed that one of the human beings behind the corporate camouflage was the cellist Putin took to see a forbidden altar. Somehow he amassed a secret fortune that ran to millions. We have known the answers to these questions for a long time but it was just too lucrative to tell ourselves we didn’t. Twin pipelines of money sustain Putin and his fellow kleptocrats. One carries western money into kleptocracies to pay for natural resources; the other carries money back out again, after it’s been stolen, for safekeeping in the west’s property markets and universities and political parties. If we wish to weaken him and his system of corrupt power, we must disrupt both pipelines. That means increasing and sustaining the reduction in our consumption of Russian oil and gas. If we do not wish merely to switch our support for one kleptocracy to others, we must replace this energy supply with something other than the fossil fuels that are the lifeblood of kleptocrats everywhere. As for the second pipeline, our noisy declarations that we are turning it off – that, as Boris Johnson put it, “there is no place for dirty money in the UK” – are laughable. A few names on sanctions lists and some loophole-ridden reforms to economic crime laws not backed by budgets to enforce them are close to meaningless while we still permit financial secrecy. Nonetheless, the danger is that by throwing more and more people out of the global economy, we hasten the creation of a shadow one. Sanctions-busting deals between Iran, Venezuela and Russia – respectively kleptocracies with Islamist, socialist and imperialist masks – reveal that this alternative is already taking shape. The leaders of the Chinese kleptocracy will use this opportunity to bolster their position at the head of this new order. We are watching the rise of what I’ve called Kleptopia. An undeclared, unconventional war between kleptocracy and democracy has been under way since long before Putin’s troops marched into Ukraine. The two sides are not arranged merely by geography. The kleptocrats have plenty of allies in the west, from the lawyers shielding their plunder to the politicians advancing their influence within democratic governments. Their victims include both Ukrainian civilians and Russian conscripts. With whom do we stand? Catriona Kelly is honorary professor of Russian and Soviet culture and senior research fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge and the author of St Petersburg: Shadows of the Past (Yale) I left St Petersburg on 22 February 2022, reaching London just 27 hours before Russian troops crossed the borders into Ukraine. For days, I’d been sure the invasion would happen. The question was, on what scale. I’d read speculation in the Russian press about intent to occupy the whole country. Surely that wasn’t possible? All the same, with Petersburg friends I drank the old Soviet toast “To Peace!” – speaking in lowered voices. What has happened since has destroyed hope and confirmed fear. This unprovoked, brutal and bungled attack on a near neighbour has been Russia’s worst foreign policy disaster in decades. For those of us who know and love Ukraine, but also love Russia, it’s a personal as well as a human tragedy. Large numbers of Russians don’t support the war. It’s an attack on Russia’s independence too. Many are fleeing from their increasingly hostile homeland – wherever flights still operate and borders are open. Much as I share Tolstoy’s scepticism about the individual’s impact on history, to a significant extent this is Vladimir Putin’s war. Determined to reverse the entropy for which he blames Gorbachev, Putin believes in the transhistorical unity of Great Russia, Little Russia and White Russia. Ukraine as such does not exist. At best, “Little Russia” is a province that is entitled to its own picturesque traditions. But autonomy equals disloyalty. Those who seek it are “Nazis”. The term assimilates campaigners for Ukrainian independence to the invaders routed by the Soviet Union (for which read, Russia) in the great patriotic war between 1941 and 1945. At the same time, it erases from the record the crucial contribution to victory in that war of Ukrainians themselves. Only such wilful forgetting could allow Putin, a Leningrader, to inflict on Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kyiv and Mykolaiv the siege warfare that devastated his birthplace in 1941-1944. After 1991, Russian politicians rapidly learned from the west how to govern by spin. The 2012 campaign to restore “spiritual ties”, much mocked by big-city sophisticates, was as focus-group-oriented as anything dreamed up by Dominic Cummings. It spoke to those who felt that globalisation had left them behind, when even goods made in Russia often came from factories owned by international corporations: Danone, Ford, Ikea, Heineken. When Putin first started talking about the historic unity of Russia and Ukraine, in the spring of 2014, this too seemed expedient, an attempt to justify post factum the impromptu annexation of Crimea. The first anniversary of the annexation once past, the rhetoric died down. But in the summer of 2021, Putin’s “historical unity” talk surfaced in deadly earnest. A precipitating factor seems to have been the 2020 election protests in Belarus. If that could happen in a country whose loyalty to Russia seemed absolute, where would “external powers” (Putin doesn’t believe in dissent without them) get to work next? The first difficulty in solving “the Putin problem” is thus that Putin is determined to defeat and purge independent Ukraine. Peace talks have been an iteration of certainties by Russian delegates set on a no-compromise position. Typical is Vladimir Medinsky, the former culture minister, an ideologue of Russian supremacism supported by bad history. It is tempting to think that if Putin and his allies were to disappear, a rational solution would emerge. Yet substantial sections of the population still support Putin: those who share his prejudices about Ukraine; those convinced the west is out to destroy Russia; those for whom things have got better since 1991; those terrified things may get worse. Putin, unlike Maria in The Sound of Music, isn’t a problem with an easy solution. But let’s concentrate on what may be achievable. Here’s a brief and imperfect list: Push for proper peace talks, accompanied by a full ceasefire, and with participation in the talks of observers trusted by both sides. As the war drags on and casualties mount, and the economic costs begin to bite, there could be a change of heart on the Russian side. There are some signs of disunity at the top even now. Listen to voices from the region. A good place to start is Ukrainian activist and historian Taras Bilous’s essay, A Letter to the Western Left from Kyiv (published recently on openDemocracy), which corrects many of the British media cliches about insuperable linguistic, cultural, historical and geographical divides and the influence of the far right. Recognise the efforts, at great personal cost, of the Russians who oppose the war: the demonstrators exposed to police beatings; the artists and administrators who resign from their jobs; the priests who speak up in their sermons when the hierarchy is silent; a few members of the business elite. Don’t organise blanket boycotts by citizenship. Don’t organise boycotts by place of origin either. Rather than ostracising works of art, try to understand the complex history of Russian imperialism. Pushkin’s To the Slanderers of Russia (1831) told western critics that Russia’s repression of Poland was a family affair. But Evdokiya Rostopchina’s The Forced Marriage (1845) presented Russia and Poland as an abusive husband and defiant wife – provoking outrage in Nicholas I. Keep up the remarkable outpouring of support for Ukraine. Make sure the media caravans and flashmobs don’t just gallop on to the next sensation. After the campaign for peace with honour, there must be generous aid from the west to help Ukrainians rebuild their devastated cities and the democracy that they are fighting so hard to preserve. In an address to the nation, the Russian Union of Rectors described Putin’s decision to embark on the “military operation” as “born of suffering”. When I think of suffering, I don’t see a small man sitting alone at the end of a long table. I see people sheltered in basements and metro stations, separated from their loved ones and their friends, or fleeing from their homes under gunfire. A Ukrainian friend, a gifted literary critic, snatched a book as she and her husband left Kyiv. She later found it was The Sound and the Fury. It couldn’t better have suited the mood among those opposed to the war, who are eloquent in their outrage. Maybe Tolstoy was right after all: it is the apparently powerful who lack full humanity, and not those whom they try to harm. Oliver Bullough is the author of Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take It Back. His new book is Butler to the World (Profile) All the horror that Putin is unleashing – the death, the lies, the violence, the refugees trudging through landscapes bleached of their colour by snow and artillery – echoes the 1940s. Putin himself calls the Ukrainians Nazis, as if this unprovoked aggression is somehow a rerun of the Soviet people’s self-defence in the second world war. That accusation is disgusting, but it’s harder to dismiss the parallels between Putin’s own behaviour and those of the dictators of the mid-20th century. He is driven by a perverse misreading of history to deny his neighbours’ humanity. Russian officials and politicians are aggressive in their patriotism. The orange-and-black striped medal ribbon became the nationalist symbol when Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014, and the air-recognition-mark “Z” has rapidly morphed into an equivalent for this new war. Putin is a bully who invades his neighbours and kills his critics, and whose government lies compulsively, even about facts that are so self-evidently true that denying them seems self-defeating. He is even driving his tanks through Ukraine, the second world war’s main battleground. In the circumstances, how could our understanding of Putin not be filtered through 20th-century history? And of course there are lessons for us from that time – about the futility of appeasement, and the heroism of ordinary humans caught up in inhumanity. But Putin is not Hitler or Benito Mussolini, he is not even Joseph Stalin, he is a modern problem, and solving a problem like him requires new skills, new sacrifices, and new laws. In the first place, the Russian elite’s patriotism and anti-western posturing is performative. The anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny has made a cottage industry of revealing how top-ranking officials or regime propagandists have property in countries that are the supposed enemy. After a hard week campaigning against the evil west, which is undermining Christian civilisation by allowing gay people to get married, they would fly to their villas in Italy or their townhouses in London. They may think they believe what they say, but their actions belie them: the ideology is just cant to confuse foreigners and keep Russians in line. Russia is an astonishingly unequal country, with the elite owning a share of wealth as great as, if not greater than, that owned by pre-revolutionary aristocrats. These kleptocrats exploited connections in government to gain lucrative contracts or state property, but they don’t trust the legal system, which waved through this monstrous spate of theft, any more than any other Russian does. That is why they have moved at least half of their wealth out of Russia, and spent it on houses, yachts, football clubs, fine art and more. Their investment managers have been in London, Luxembourg and New York, and complement the harder skills that the oligarchs learned in Russia’s business climate. What would Russia be without these offshore services? It would be a fading power with a declining population run by an ageing political class loyal to a dead empire. Its sole world-class assets are its resources of oil, gas and minerals, many of which will become irrelevant in the decarbonised world we are moving towards. The USSR’s soft power was once enormous, with its communist ideology, sublime ballet companies, film directors and musicians. But what does the Kremlin have now? A misinformation machine and an unequal alliance with a Chinese elite that must be looking at Russia’s riches and licking their lips. Putin claims to be defending the rights of Russian-speakers everywhere, yet during the pandemic, Russia had the worst rate of excess deaths of any country, a rate twice as bad as that of the United States and three times as bad as Britain’s. If he truly cared about the nation he serves, he would be focusing on Russia’s healthcare catastrophe instead of sending its sons to die in Ukraine. We cannot solve the problem of Putin; only the Russians can do that. But we can stop helping him be a bigger problem than he has to be. The first step is to deprive him and his cronies of their access to our financial system. Being able to bury their wealth deep in our economies has allowed Russia’s rulers to avoid the consequences of their own greed: their children have studied in English schools; their wealth has been invested in western funds; their German-built yachts fly under the flags of British tax havens. The way to do this is to strip them of the shield they can gain from opaque shell companies. Britain’s tax havens have sold secrecy to anyone able to afford it, while the UK’s Companies House has provided the cover for hundreds of billions of pounds of stolen wealth to flow out of Russia. When the shield over assets is lifted, we must give our law enforcement agencies the resources they need to investigate the assets’ provenance, and confiscate anything of criminal origin. Stripped of their access to the international financial system and of their stolen riches, Putin’s oligarchs will be not plutocrats but thugs. Deprived of their boltholes, they will be forced either to improve Russia for everyone that lives in it, or they will be swept from power. Ruth Deyermond is programme director for the MA in international relations at King’s College London and author of The US and Russia after the Cold War Although Russia’s war against Ukraine is less than a month old, the debate about what will come after it is already starting to emerge. So far, the war appears to be going very badly for Russia. Its assumptions about the country it chose to invade have been exposed as fatally flawed; years of expensive military reform have failed to produce an army capable of effectively fighting a war of choice; and it has had to deny asking the Chinese government to feed and arm its troops. Despite this litany of humiliations, the relative strength of the Russian armed forces mean that a military victory can’t be ruled out. There would probably be continued resistance, forcing Russia to choose between draining its catastrophically damaged economy and military capabilities in an open-ended occupation, and a withdrawal. Unless sanctions are lifted, its most important trading and diplomatic relationships – above all, with China – will be firmly tilted in favour of its partners, who will be able to deal with Russia on much more favourable terms than in the past. Whatever happens in Ukraine, it seems likely that Putin will remain in power for the foreseeable future. Nothing about his behaviour in the past decade has indicated that he would be willing to give up power voluntarily, and it seems unlikely that those in the best position to remove him will do so, not least because they are themselves closely tied to Putin and his crimes. This raises the question of how western states respond to a Putin-led Russia and how they organise their relationships with one another. First, European states and the US need to recognise that there is no going back to the world before February 2022. On issues of strategic stability, cooperation, energy security, and indulgence towards the oligarch money that has corrupted their politics, there has to be a commitment to permanent change. Some of this is already happening, but there will be pressure from other governments, lobbyists of various kinds, and from public opinion in an era of rising living costs, to undo many of the recent changes as quickly as possible, particularly in relation to sanctions. This would be a mistake, not least because Putin would be likely to see it as further confirmation of western weakness and disunity – a longstanding assumption in his foreign policy, and one of the factors that seems to have led to his huge miscalculation in Ukraine. Western states also need to acknowledge how badly they miscalculated both their relationship with Russia and the international significance of Russia’s relations with its post-Soviet neighbours. Too often in the 30 years since the collapse of the USSR, the US, the UK and others have treated Russia as little more than an irritating obstacle to getting on with the more serious business of world politics in the Middle East or east Asia. At the same time, some European states clearly prioritised energy relations with Russia over questions about where Russian foreign policy was heading. As a result, and because of a shameful view that what was happening in Ukraine or Belarus or the South Caucasus was not really a significant concern for Europe and the US, they failed both to properly respond to the first wave of Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014, or to think seriously enough about the implications for wider European security. Those implications can hardly be overstated. The reaction to the war in Ukraine has shown that despite the repeated claims of the past two decades, it is only now that a line has been drawn under the post-cold war period. For the first time since the late 1980s, western states are being forced to confront the fact that a wider European war is possible (though still unlikely), and that it would involve conflict between states with nuclear weapons. The gravity of the risks means that there needs to be an urgent recommitment to Nato as a defensive military alliance, including a commitment by all members to meet their obligations on defence spending. Those European states that have not joined, particularly those close to Russia, need to decide whether or not they want to remain outside the bloc in an era without the relatively stable rules of the cold war and where the ambiguity of the past 30 years is a vanished luxury. Neutrality is largely in the eye of the beholder, and if the Kremlin regards states as de facto allies of the US, lack of Nato membership is unlikely to protect them from whatever forms of aggression it will be capable of after Ukraine. The issue of relations with the other European states of the former Soviet Union also needs to be treated as a priority. One of the triggers for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine seems to have been the mixed signalling over Ukraine’s Nato membership, which was neither ruled out nor firmly ruled in. Nato and the EU both need to decide, and to communicate clearly, whether they plan to admit the remaining post-Soviet states that want to become members, and what the relationship with them will look like if they don’t. At the same time, even if it is unpalatable to talk about it now, there will also need to be engagement with the Russian government in some areas, as there was between the west and the USSR even in dark periods of the cold war such as the early 1980s. The most important area will probably be nuclear arms control. The western debate about a no-fly zone and the Russian government’s inflammatory, if vague, threats about nuclear weapons are a sharp reminder of the threat of escalation between nuclear superpowers – a threat that, worryingly, many seemed to have forgotten or dismissed. However hostile the relationship between Russia and the west becomes, dialogue on nuclear matters needs to be maintained. Similarly, some level of continuing military-to-military diplomatic contact on other issues will remain important – more important, in fact, than it has been in periods of better relations. Channels of communication between militaries are important for reducing the risk of miscalculation, even where they are unlikely to build much trust. Finally, the west will need to think about how it tries to engage with Russian society. Closing off all contact will simply confirm Putin’s narrative that the west wants to destroy Russia. States need to keep their doors open to Russians who want to study or visit, as well as those who are escaping repression. None of this is going to be easy, and much of it may fall foul of domestic pressures, wishful thinking, and splits within the EU and Nato. But Europe and the US’s future security depends on recognising that we are in a moment of acute danger, and that we are all in it together. Peter Pomerantsev is the author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia and This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality (Faber) Last Monday, a senior producer at the primetime Russian state news programme ran on to the set as it was being broadcast live and waved a placard protesting against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and encouraging the audience to disbelieve her own channel’s propaganda. She was soon hauled off set and disappeared for two days into police custody. She described her act as a desperate attempt to cleanse her conscience for having “zombified” the Russian people. Some have called her a hero, others say it is too little too late. But whatever your take, ultimately solving the Putin problem and creating change in Russia means confronting the psychological grip he has on his own people. The mental model of Putinism, the worldview it constructs with propaganda of word and deed to keep Russians under control, is built on several foundations: it appeals to nostalgia; it projects a conspiratorial perspective and it insists that Putin can get away with anything, that there is no alternative to Putin. As oppositionally minded Russians, pro-democracy media, civil society activists and public diplomats from the west seek to engage the Russian people, they need to take into account the strengths and weaknesses of these foundations. Even if Putin manages to cut off the Russian internet even further (he has already shut down Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and the last independent radio and online television stations), there will always be ways to reach the Russian people, from virtual private networks to satellite TV. The question is what to talk to them about. Currently, most Russians back the war and Putin’s reasons for it. It’s hard to trust polls in a dictatorship where you get 12 years in jail for mentioning the word “war”. Moreover, it’s always nice to hide behind propaganda: pretending you don’t know what’s going on allows you to avoid responsibility and make any tough or dangerous decisions. But even if these cognitive biases, fears and motivations to dodge reality don’t shift immediately there are already vulnerabilities in Putin’s main propaganda strategies. Let’s start with Putin’s uses of nostalgia. His mission has always been to “bring Russia off its knees”, the Kremlin version of “make America great again”. This has now reached a climax: in his rambling historical speech validating the invasion of Ukraine he invoked his mission to restore the Russian empire, and framed his war in terms of a second world war redux to battle (utterly mythical) Nazis. Apart from the pleasures of wallowing in (often fictional) past glories, this nostalgia propaganda is effective psychologically in other ways too. It posits that the great Russian people have been humiliated by malign outside powers, and now Putin is restoring pride. The most important humiliation Russians experience, both historically and currently, is of course internal. But the nostalgia narrative allows the Kremlin to transfer its own brutality on to a shadowy outside “enemy”, and then help people relieve their pent-up anger through aggression. The abusive, sadistic tone of Putin’s speeches, and the ones of his leading TV propagandists such as Vladimir Solovyov, give people an emotional path to articulate and validate their darkest and most violent feelings. It’s OK to be vicious and mean, this propaganda implies, it’s all history’s fault. But this nostalgia propaganda also exists to cover up Putin’s great achilles heel: his lack of a vision for the future. The future has long disappeared from Russian political discourse. Thinking about the future means concentrating on political reforms, cleaning up the courts, abolishing corruption – all things Putin cannot achieve, as they will put his own system in danger. With the new economic reality post-invasion, any hope for the future has been eradicated completely. But people will still think about it. What do the sanctions, which are yet to properly kick in, mean for their children’s futures? Media and communication with the Russian people needs to focus on these questions about the future. Both on the personal level, but also in terms of the future of the country. What, ultimately, should the future role of Russia be in the world? One of the most resonant phrases on Russia media runs: “What’s the point of the world if there’s no place for Russia in it?” The “Russia” this invokes is imperial, its identity tied to crushing others. Is there another way? To further open up such questions, a group of Russian academics led by historian Alexander Etkind propose to create a university in the Baltics that will bring students from Russia and its neighbours to work on common challenges such as the environment. Projects like these are of course long-term aims, but without the language and ideas with which to talk about the future we can’t even start to chart the way towards it. This idea of a future Russia has to be developed in partnership with Russia’s neighbours, so that it balances the needs of all of them, and escapes the conspiratorial, zero-sum vision of the world Putin’s propaganda promotes. Conspiracy thinking is another foundation of Putin’s playbook. It serves many uses. Conspiratorial thinking helps solidify community, promoting a sense of “us” under attack from “them”. It helps explain a confusing world. It also removes any sense of responsibility. Big new posters around Moscow claim that Russia “wasn’t given any choice” but to start the war, implying it’s all the fault of enemy powers. Ultimately, conspiracy thinking also spreads a sense that people are powerless to change anything in the world, which in turn seeds passivity. This can often be beneficial to the Kremlin: it wants a docile country. But this sort of thinking can also work against the government. It feeds a culture of suspicion and distrust. Thus, during Covid Russians refused to take the Kremlin’s vaccine, suspecting the government itself was somehow plotting something malign against them. As the sanctions take effect, and if people become painfully aware that their experience is far more arduous than that of the elites, a crisis in motivation could kick in. Putin’s system has always motivated people by giving them a piece in the overall cake of everyday corruption: from the traffic cop up to the minister. As long as you showed your loyalty occasionally, you were free to pursue your own financial aims. Now that motivation is gone, and you’re meant to make great sacrifices for a conspiratorial pseudo-ideology. People could simply give up on keeping the system going. This is what happened at the end of the USSR, when many people basically stopped fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Not so much a strike as just lack of motivation and despondence. Revealing this disparity between the elites and normal people will require independent, investigative Russian journalism. Since the war, however, much of this is largely based abroad. They will have to rely on tracing documents and open-source investigations. We will need a whole new iteration of what the Russian journalist and editor Roman Badanin, founder of the investigative online media outlet Agentstvo, calls “offshore journalism”: exile media that uses modern tools to stay as close to the home country as possible. As the economic situation worsens, and the propaganda weakens, Putin will turn to the power ministries to use oppression rather than ideas. This has always been his final argument: that he can carry out any crimes at home, any invasion abroad, any war crime from Grozny to Aleppo, and get away with it. In Ukraine, Putin is purposefully targeting humanitarian corridors, bombing refugees and hospitals in order to break the will of the people. It’s a message to the world that all statements about humanitarian values, the UN’s “responsibility to protect”, “safe zones” is guff. His argument is that might is right, and in the futureless new world the ones who are most ruthless, from Beijing to Riyadh and Moscow, will flourish. One small, first, but hopefully important step has been taken by the human rights lawyer and author Philippe Sands, who is trying to create a Nuremberg-style tribunal for those who began this war, not merely for war crimes but for having started a completely unprovoked invasion in the first place. In the meantime, however, there’s a joke going round pro-Putin circles inside Russia: Two Russian soldiers are drinking champagne in Russian-occupied Paris, the whole of Europe conquered. “Did you hear?” one smiles to the other. “We lost the information war.” Such humour is its own form of propaganda: helping push Russians away from the thought that the “special operation” isn’t going quite as planned. But it highlights a deeper truth: in wartime, propaganda of the deed outweighs propaganda of the word.",News/World news,How do we solve a problem like Putin?

3/20/2022,"When Basma Gale invited a family of Ukrainian refugees into her home in Kent a week ago, she felt nervous. Would the couple’s two small children be traumatised by the bombing they had experienced? Would her own children get along with them? She had never done anything like this before: would it all be a little awkward? A week later, she says Sergei and Oksana Koletvinov feel like family. She is very proud of the way her children, eight year-old Safiya and six-year-old Joshua, have befriended the couple’s eight-year-old daughter Alica and two-year-old son, Cemeh, despite not sharing a language. “Within half an hour of their arrival, all four children were running about the house together, having pillow fights and playing with playdough.” She and her husband Tom had already spoken to their children at the beginning of the Russian invasion to explain what was happening. “We think it’s really important that our children grow up understanding how privileged they are. How it could easily be us in the same situation, to create that sense of empathy for all humans. So when Sergei and Oksana’s children came to stay with us, they just knew what to do – which was to welcome them and play with them, just as they would with friends or cousins.” They were introduced to the family through Tom’s father, the Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, who had gone to Calais to see what was happening at the border. “He called us to ask if we would consider giving them a home.” Basma volunteers with refugees and her husband grew up with refugees being brought into his family home through his father’s work, so it didn’t take them long to say yes. “I think if any human is in need, you just do it if you can – and we’re fortunate we’ve got the space.” The Koletvinovs arrived at the small village near Canterbury a few hours later. They are staying in the Gales’ spare room, which has an en-suite toilet and shower, and she has also offered them a room downstairs as a private living area. “But it’s not a one-way thing. It’s an exchange. They’ve been cooking us breakfast and making us soups for lunch. They’re really keen to introduce us to their national dishes and what they eat.” Basma particularly enjoyed borscht, a traditional Ukrainian beetroot soup, and a chicken soup Oksana made her. “It tasted amazing – really fresh and very healthy and nutritious. And then it was just lovely, learning to say ‘thank you’ and ‘this is delicious’ in Ukrainian.” The Gales have also introduced the Koletvinovs to some English traditions. “Their daughter lost a tooth the other day, so we’ve been teaching them about the tooth fairy.” Sergei spent an evening playing football with Tom, who organises a local kickabout twice a week, and two-year-old Cemeh was delighted to be given his first taste of Coco Pops by Joshua. “He and my little boy just sat themselves down and had breakfast together and it was just the cutest thing to see.” Living in an area of Kent that is less diverse and multicultural than other parts of the country, Basma – who is of South Asian heritage – is keen for her children to learn about the world. “So it’s wonderful for us to have people actually in our home that they can learn from every day.” The Kolentvinovs spent two days under bombardment in Kharkiv before making their escape to England via the Polish border. Sergei, who previously spent five years working in London, speaks English and has a permanent right to reside in Britain, said that before they arrived at Basma’s house, his son had become terrified of loud noises. “He would tell me: ‘Escape! Escape!’ But now, it’s OK. He’s much better now – much, much better. Both my children are very happy here, with Basma’s children. Basma and Tom are very good people. They treat us like family,” Sergei said. He is an experienced driver and is keen to get a job in the UK. “If war had not started, we would never have come. But I feel at home here in England. And I feel hope.”",News/World news,"From Kharkiv to Kent, life with the Ukrainian refugees who now feel like family ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/from-kharkiv-to-kent-life-with-the-ukrainian-refugees-who-now-feel-like-family
3/20/2022,"A leading expert on looted antiquities is calling for the J Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles to return a Roman fresco fragment to Italy, claiming he has evidence that links the piece to a notorious dealer. Prof Christos Tsirogiannis has a photograph of the same fresco fragment from the archive of Robert Hecht who died in 2012, having faced accusations that he trafficked in illicit artefacts. These artefacts included a 2,500-year-old Greek vase that he sold in 1972 for a then record $1m to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and which was subsequently returned to Italy in 2008. The fresco fragment bears a beautiful depiction of a young woman looking out from a balcony. Wearing a loose-fitting tunic, she is sipping from a shallow cup held in her right hand. A photograph of it was among material, including antiquities still covered in soil, seized by police from Hecht in 2001. The fresco fragment had been donated to the Getty in 1996 by a private collector who had bought it from one of Hecht’s intermediaries in 1987. Tsirogiannis, a former senior field archaeologist at the University of Cambridge, is now associate professor at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. He believes this fragment could well have come from Pompeii and he has alerted the district attorney’s office in New York. He said: “It’s a beautiful, rare depiction that comes from the area of Vesuvius, probably from one of the villas covered by ash following the eruption. The museum has substantial evidence that connects it to known traffickers. Dozens of antiquities from the same private collection have already been returned by the Getty to Italy. This is another case.” In 2000, Lord Renfrew, the leading Cambridge archaeologist, singled out the fragment as an antiquity “of unknown provenance” and questioned its acquisition by the private collector. Last week, he too called for the Getty to return it to Italy. He told the Observer: “One can presume it to be looted when it really has no respectable provenance. You need a provenance going back to the beginning of the century to be of any value. “So I would say, it’s clearly an example of a looted antiquity. There are various places that such a wall painting can come from, but Pompeii is certainly one possibility.” Looted antiquities are a particularly sensitive subject for the museum, which was founded by American industrialist John Paul Getty. Its former curator of antiquities, Marion True, was indicted in 2005 – with Hecht – in Italy for being part of a stolen-art ring, although all charges were dropped because the limitation period had expired. Tsirogiannis’s research has focused on antiquities and trafficking networks and law enforcement authorities gave him official access in the early 2000s to tens of thousands of images and other archival material seized in police raids from individuals involved in the illicit trade. Over 15 years, he has identified about 1,580 looted artefacts within auction houses, commercial galleries, private collections and museums. He alerts police authorities and governments, playing a significant role in securing the repatriation of many antiquities. He identified an ancient Greek bronze horse, which Sotheby’s New York had planned to sell in 2018 until he notified the authorities of its links to the disgraced British antiquities dealer Robin Symes. In 2020, Sotheby’s lost its legal challenge and Greece’s culture minister hailed the court’s ruling as a significant victory for countries fighting to reclaim antiquities. Having linked a number of antiquities to Hecht, including two large vases that were repatriated to Italy in 2012, he said that the latest example is a Roman helmet that Christie’s New York will offer on 12 April for an estimated $600,000. He said he has similar photographic evidence showing that it too had come through Hecht’s hands. A Getty spokesperson said: “Getty continually researches the background and provenance of items within its collection and considers new evidence when it is presented. We have a longstanding policy of returning objects to their country of origin or discovery when the research indicates it is warranted.” Christie’s declined to comment.",News/Science,Fresco fragment from Pompeii reopens row over ‘looted’ artefacts,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/20/getty-museum-fresco-fragment-pompeii-row-looted-artefacts
3/20/2022,"My grandfather went to sea in his mid-teens. He served at the battle of Jutland – the Somme of the sea. In the Second World War, he worked on the Atlantic convoys, bringing food and supplies to a besieged Britain – the Stalingrad of the sea. Shortly after the war, the ship on which he was working as a stoker, the Cydonia, hit a stray mine and he was boiled alive when the engine blew up. The newspapers reported that the ship had been damaged “with the loss of one greaser”. The same phrasing appears in the records of the shipping company. He’s not named anywhere. He was commemorated not as a person but as a component. Which is how P&O dealt with their employees last week. All ships called in as if they were pedalos on a boating lake; security sent in to remove crews. So here we are, an island nation, our sea lanes closed just when every parish hall and spare room is filling up with toiletries and warm clothing that people were hoping to ship to Ukraine. The companies in Jason Reitman’s film Up in the Air outsource uncomfortable sackings to a “corporate downsizer”, played by George Clooney. That seemed far fetched at the time but P&O didn’t even bother with that. They sacked crews remotely, using a pre-recorded Teams message. The MP for Dover, Natalie Elphicke, went down to the port to protest. Like your neighbourhood arsonist offering you a flask of tea over the smoking ruins of your house. She was met with shouts of “shame on you” from the sacked workers who understood, as perhaps she didn’t, that this is not an aberration. This is the economy going to plan, as clearly outlined in Britannia Unchained, a booklet cut and pasted together by five Tory MPs. (Elphicke, like her whole party, had voted against Barry Gardiner’s fire and rehire bill which might have prevented this.) It’s a short book but if you read it you’ll see that a decent editor could have got it down to one sentence. “When we seek to protect the vulnerable we limit the freedom of the rich and the privileged – and that is a disgrace.” It’s a wretched read – a series of assertions and hunches freed from the chains of argument or evidence, with the intellectual rigour of a YouTube conspiracy rant. The prose occasionally soars to the level of clickbait, as in its most famous sentence: “The British are among the worst idlers in the world.” Most of its authors are now cabinet ministers in a government that no one would call exactly Stakhanovite. The transport secretary – who goes by the name of Grant Shapps and is not one of the infamous five – wrote a stiff letter to the CEO of P&O but was too exhausted by the effort to look up the chap’s name and addressed it to someone who had retired a while back. The chains from which the booklet’s authors want to free Britannia are, of course, those of regulation. The heroic age of regulation began at sea with Samuel Plimsoll’s attempt to govern a shipping industry that had lobbied against laws to forbid overloading and lobbied for laws that imposed prison sentences on sailors who refused to join unseaworthy ships. Nicolette Jones’s brilliant biography of Plimsoll, The Plimsoll Sensation, points out that the tactics used against him were both vicious and familiar. “Plimsollism is terrorism,” ran one headline. The royal commission that was eventually established was deliberately swamped with “evidence” about the impossibility of ever establishing a standard load line. It would just have to be left to the wisdom of shipowners, one of whom, the honourable member for Plymouth, was the owner of three ships that had been lost with all hands and two others that had been abandoned. It was simply cheaper to price in the deaths of thousands of crew than to sail safely. There’s a school of thought that the market will make P&O suffer for its bad behaviour, that customers will be appalled and not use them. It’s true that the market does regulate the market, but it does so through catastrophe. It took the death of 80, many of them children, in a rail crash in Armagh in 1889 to make the case that train companies should be legally obliged to have brakes on carriages. In the 1870s, The Daily Telegraph revealed that one train guard had been found asleep on the job towards the end of a 40-hour shift. The company had instructed the porter to nudge him awake whenever he dropped off. We are immediately angered by the casual sacking of British crews but we need to remember that the point of sacking them is to replace them with Filipino crews who can also be treated – like that guard – as components. We’ve allowed a narrative to take hold in which regulation is seen as the enemy of the individual. Indeed, we’ve elected a prime minister who made his name as a kind of anti-regulation Roy Chubby Brown. But historically, regulation is how we have established the importance of the human in the face of the machine. It’s how we care for each other. It’s always a fight. My friend, Michael Molloy, died in his teens when the coach he was travelling on crashed. The coach’s tyres turned out to be older than he was. When his mother fought for regulation, the bill she campaigned for was thrown out by Chris Heaton-Harris, the current chief whip. P&O is the logical outcome of the assault on the rules-based world that we tried to build after the war. It’s a campaign for disconnection. Clooney’s character in Up in the Air finds that he has somehow exchanged his own ability to make relationships for a pocket full of air miles. He wanders the world like an oligarch’s super-yacht – always voyaging, never docking, in perpetual and pointless motion. All at sea. At our best we hunger for connection – it’s why we wanted those ferries to take that warm clothing to Ukraine. Shortly after he was elected pope, Francis went to see the refugees in Lampedusa and talked about Lope de Vega’s play Fuenteovejuna, in which an entire town gets rid of a tyrant of a governor by murdering him. All the inhabitants are complicit so none of them has to take responsibility. The former Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Company is now owned by DP World – a “logistics solutions” organisation based in Dubai. Its power is rootless, mobile. The management of P&O distanced themselves with tech, as though they were mere functions of their own software. Components. The chains that Truss and Raab and Patel are trying to cut are the chains that bind us to each other. The chains that tell us that we too are involved in catastrophes like Ukraine or the drownings in the Mediterranean. Cut those chains and we are all diminished.
