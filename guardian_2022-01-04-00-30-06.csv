1/4/2022,"The Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, has insisted that the club are “back as big players” in the transfer market after Ferran Torres was unveiled at Camp Nou. When asked if Barça were interested in signing Dortmund striker Erling Haaland despite the club’s recent financial problems, Laporta replied: “We’re working to build a top team. Everything is possible if we do things well, and I’m sure we will. Top players are open to joining Barça. We’re definitely recovering our status.”  “Everybody in the world should get ready, as we are back as big players in the market,” Laporta added. “Barça are back!” The club president also praised new arrival Torres, who has joined from Manchester City, with Barcelona securing a bank loan to help fund the Spain forward’s €55m move. “You are young, but you already have plenty of experience,” Laporta said to Torres during the presentation. “We knew about Ferran’s situation and we were very pleased that he wanted to come to Barça so much. He is a great player.” The club’s director of football, Mateu Alemany, brushed off concerns about completing the formalities of the transfer. “The truth of the situation is that when we signed Torres, we knew we did not have room in terms of salaries,” Alemany said. “However, we have been making moves in different areas and we are convinced we can register him.” Torres was presented as a Barcelona player after signing a five-and-a-half year deal with a €1bn buyout clause. The 21-year-old said he was attracted by the “challenge” of returning the club to the top of European football. “I am facing this challenge with ambition, humility and a lot of desire,” Torres said. “I had the idea of coming back to La Liga and Barça showed an interest. I want to take Barça back to where it belongs.” Torres spent just 16 months at the Etihad Stadium after joining City from Valencia in the summer of 2020, scoring 16 goals in 43 appearances in all competitions. The forward broke his metatarsal on international duty in October, but is expected to be fit for the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Real Madrid on 12 January.",Sport/Football,‘Barça are back!’ Laporta insists club can compete for star names as Torres arrives,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/joan-laporta-barcelona-ferran-torres-erling-haaland
1/4/2022,"A teenager has been charged with the murder of 15-year-old Zaian Aimable-Lina, one of two boys to be killed within about an hour of each other in separate stabbing incidents in London on Thursday evening. The suspect, who is also aged 15 and whom police have not named because of his age, was arrested on Saturday and is due to appear at Bromley magistrates court in south London on Tuesday.  Another 15-year-old has been released under investigation after being arrested on suspicion of murder on Friday. He has been bailed until late January, police said. A postmortem gave the cause of Zaian’s death as a stab wound to the heart. A vigil was held over the weekend at Ashburton Park in Croydon, where the stabbing took place. Dozens of people gathered at a gate leading into the park on Saturday evening. Candles were lit and people consoled each other following the latest tragedy in the capital. There was also an increased police presence, with officers patrolling up and down the road adjacent to the park. The second teenager stabbed to death on Thursday evening, a 16-year-old boy in Yiewsley, west London, has yet to be named. A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of his murder on Sunday. The two incidents made last year the deadliest on record in terms of homicides of teenagers. The 30 recorded in 2021 surpassed the 29 in 2008 – the previous worst toll. As the news emerged, campaigners said efforts to tackle knife crime had been inadequate and it was now so prevalent that it was becoming normalised. “Knife crime is accepted by this generation as part-and-parcel of growing up and that’s completely unacceptable,” said Patrick Green, the chief executive of the anti-knife crime charity the Ben Kinsella Trust, which was set up in 2008 after the fatal stabbing of 16-year-old Ben in north London. “It shows that not enough has been done and, if I’m being really critical, then I’d say the approach to tackling it has been scattergun. We have to sustain our response to knife crime, it has to be over the long term and not just one- and two-year funding for projects. It is a societal problem which will continue unless it is addressed properly.”",News/UK news,"Croydon stabbing: boy, 15, charged with murder of Zaian Aimable-Lina",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/croydon-stabbing-boy-15-charged-murder-zaian-aimable-lina
1/4/2022,"Newcastle United are increasingly confident of signing Kieran Trippier from Atlético Madrid by the end of the week and hope to open formal negotiations with the 31-year-old England right-back within the next 48 hours. Although Atletico rejected Newcastle’s initial offer for Trippier, a deal in the region of £25m is expected to be finalised after Diego Simeone appeared to abandon realistic hope of keeping him in the Spanish capital.  “Kieran Trippier is an extraordinary footballer who has given us a lot and we will try to keep him,” said Atlético’s manager. “We want him to stay, he’s an important player, but nowadays, when a player wants to leave, you can’t force them to stay. You can’t retain them.” Although Trippier started Atlético’s 2-0 home win against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, he appeared to wave farewell to the crowd at the end and was the last player to leave the pitch. With Chelsea potentially interested in Trippier, Eddie Howe is keen to seal the reunion with a player he signed for Burnley as soon as possible but Newcastle’s manager seems unlikely to have Sven Botman alongside Trippier in defence when Watford visit St James’ Park for a vital relegation “six-pointer” on Saturday week. Newcastle have had a bid rejected by Lille for Botman, a Netherlands Under-21 centre-half who has recently broken into his country’s senior squad. The French club appear determined to keep the 21-year-old, with an offer in the region of £30m currently insufficient to persuade them to part with a defender also admired by, among others, Milan. Although Lille have financial difficulties they are in the knockout stages of the Champions League, eighth in Ligue 1 and believe Botman remains vital to their European ambitions. Howe also covets the Burnley centre-half James Tarkowski but, even though Tarkwoski could leave Turf Moor for nothing in the summer, Sean Dyche appears adamant he will not countenance weakening his team’s survival chances by selling the 29-year-old to a key relegation rival. With Callum Wilson’s torn calf muscle dictating that Howe is in the market for a centre-forward and a central midfield also on his shopping list, Newcastle hope to welcome a minimum of four signings.",Sport/Football,Newcastle confident of landing Kieran Trippier from Atlético for about £25m,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/newcastle-confident-kieran-trippier-atletico-madrid-25m
1/4/2022,"Awoman must lunch somewhere. When the prime minister told Liz Truss to examine every road post Brexit, her thoughts naturally turned to Mayfair and Hertford Street. Perhaps that nice caff at No 5. We are after all lunching with that nice American trade envoy, Katherine Tai. Perhaps two measures of dry gin; two bottles of Pazo Barrantes Albariño, a Spanish white wine, costing a total of £153; and three bottles of the French red Coudoulet de Beaucastel, costing a total of £130. Perhaps a £3,000 bill. Besides, the proprietor of 5 Hertford Street is Robin Birley, half-brother to Boris Johnson’s mate Zac Goldsmith, and buddy of Michael Gove and David Cameron. And he tipped Johnson 20 grand for his “leadership” campaign, wherever that went.  Surely such generosity calls for a kindly nod and wink. 5 Hertford Street posted substantial losses last year, so the money might come in handy. Birley even halved the bill if it could be paid straight away. The office wants Truss to slum it in Soho. She hits the roof. Who wins trade deals in Soho? Besides, this is one for Birley. The joy of British corruption is that there are no crude brown envelopes stuffed with notes. Money is never seen changing hands. Negotiation is via a pat on the shoulder, a placement at a dinner, a nod at the tennis net. There need not be a direct quid pro, but favours can flow both ways: a party donation, a contract, a planning refusal overturned, all rounded off with the knighthood or peerage. The British like to pretend their political culture is pure, but benign terms have been used to mask questionable interactions. In times past, the Metropolitan police vehicle for the receipt of informal benefit was the “police benevolent fund”. It was the stuff of legend and occasional comedy. Now, at a time of wild budgetary spending, every dodgy oddball is crowding round the pig trough. Goodness knows what antics will be revealed, if ever, from the proposed inquiry into the pandemic. It should be standing room only at the Old Bailey. The strangest transactions seem to revolve around politicians striving to live up to the dignity of their office, be it flat decorations, country houses or foreign holidays. Lunch at 5 Hertford Street is a classic. Turn to a party donor; at least he could host a good lunch. Truss’s civil servants saw the danger a mile off and steered her towards a more modest watering hole. She would have none of it. It went to her permanent secretary, who let it through, but he is clearly a mouse not a man. Should it now go to the cohort of Whitehall standards scrutineers? If so they must be worked off their feet, with every self-respecting property developer or drug manufacturer feeling they are carrying the weight of the Tory party on their shoulders. Perhaps the best discipline is daylight. Lunch at 5 Hertford Street is hardly a hanging crime. It rather indicates a general casualness towards public funds and relationships; an attitude of mind. Johnson was very nice to Truss. She returns the favour by shamelessly going on manoeuvres to replace him. Now she is currying favour with his friends. Is that who we want as a future prime minister?

1/4/2022,"The first professional trip I took was to Jersey, to interview a teenage skateboarder. He was slated to win some big competition, but I’m afraid I can’t tell you whether he did or what his name was. What I do remember is standing by the skate park, next to his mum, in this peculiar low island light, while he smashed himself to the ground, repeatedly, and got back up again. Before long, his elbow was bleeding – but this, his mother assured me, was an old wound, so it opened up most days. He brushed it off – didn’t even appear to notice – along with every other brutal encounter with physics and gravity. “Well, he’s 14,” his mum said. “They bounce at that age.”  He skated into my thoughts earlier this week, while the news was ablaze with England’s back-to-school mask mandate. Educationists were (and are) justifiably upset, since they received this communication – that all pupils in year 7 or above should wear masks in the classroom – long after the media had been briefed. But disgust at the absolute dishevelment of governmental standards was nothing compared with the rage of the anti-mask libertarians. It sounds like a niche group, but it includes many Conservative backbenchers, plus their supportive commentariat. Teenagers, these anti-maskers maintain, have already suffered enough. Face-coverings interfere with their learning, leave them unable to communicate with peers, render them insensate to life’s daily pleasures and reduce them to a state of slavery (granted, I saw the last claim on Twitter, where the collective 2022 resolution appears to be “be more crazy”). The thing is, my house is lousy with teenagers and I have agreed, stupidly, to stop writing about them. But I am still allowed to make the most general observations (I think). I have seen them forget their masks, try to eat through a mask, pick up a mask from the street and put it on, and flick each other with masks. But I have never heard any of them complain about wearing one. Please don’t walk away with the impression that this generation has stopped complaining. They bellyache constantly about stupid things, such as having to spend all day in the same classroom, rather than moving from one subject area to another. “What is so fun about walking down a corridor?” I have wondered aloud more than once. It’s the journey, not the destination, they say, sagely. Corridors are where all the stuff happens. Staying put and waiting for the teacher to come to you makes it feel like primary school. Will they put up with it, for the sake of public safety? Yes, but they wish the management to know that it isn’t ideal. They don’t complain, yet it is visible in their demeanours that it saps their life force when they have to attend school from home. They absolutely hate it when non-essential shops are forced to close. They weren’t wild about the bubble phase, when they had to self-isolate after the positive test result of someone they didn’t even like. There was a brief period in 2020 when they were allowed only on certain buses; that was a veritable assault on their human rights. But they adapted to masks absolutely seamlessly, uncomplainingly, faster than a baby adapts to a sock. There are a load of plausible explanations for why teenagers might moan about masks less than adults. They have better hearing, so they aren’t relying on lip-reading without knowing it. They tend to have better cardiovascular health, so they are not constantly wondering why stairs have got harder. Fundamentally, though, they are just more adaptable. We talk constantly about all the ways in which the teenage brain is like an adult brain, only less good – more volatile and impulse-driven, less able to predict consequences – and hardly talk at all about the ways in which teenagers are superior. Their entire day is structured around life’s unreasonable demands and they just acclimatise. This unruffled resilience and psychic elasticity – or bouncing, in 90s skateboarder’s-mum parlance – looks suddenly a lot more mature than what passes for maturity.

1/4/2022,"The publishing rights to David Bowie’s huge and peerless catalogue of songs have been sold by his estate to Warner Chappell Music (WCM), the publishing arm of Warner Music Group, in a deal worth at least $250m (£185m) according to anonymous sources speaking to Variety. Guy Moot, chief executive of WCM, said: “These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music for ever … We are looking forward to tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care as we strive to build on the legacy of this most extraordinary human being.”  The deal means that Warner now owns the rights to Bowie’s songwriting itself, as well as to almost all the recordings of it. In September 2021, the company completed a deal to acquire Bowie’s recordings from 2000 until his death in 2016, adding to the recordings it already owned from 1968 to 1999. Just a small cache of recorded music made prior to Bowie’s late-60s breakthrough is now not owned by Warner Music. The company has been lavishly repackaging Bowie’s back catalogue in a series of box sets in recent years. The deal is the latest in a series of major acquisitions by various companies of the catalogues of pop artists, with Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and various members of Fleetwood Mac selling the rights for their songs for large cash sums. These deals allow the publishing companies to accrue income from royalties, as well as when music is licensed for use in films, TV and advertising. Terms of the Bowie deal have not been disclosed but the Bowie estate has historically closely controlled the use of his work. The 2020 biopic Stardust, about the birth of Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust persona, was forbidden by the estate from using Bowie’s music. WCM co-chair Carianne Marshall said: “We were pleased that the estate felt that Warner Chappell has the knowledge, experience, and resources to take the reins and continue to promote a collection of this stature. All of our global leaders and departments are incredibly excited and primed to get to work with these brilliant songs across multiple avenues and platforms.” Another film that does already have the blessing of the estate is a forthcoming untitled documentary by film-maker Brett Morgen, who is using thousands of hours of rare and unseen live performance footage as its basis.",Arts/Music,David Bowie: publishing rights to song catalogue sold for $250m,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/03/david-bowie-publishing-rights-to-song-catalogue-sold-for-250m
1/4/2022,"France has taken over the rotating EU presidency for the next six months, an opportunity the president, Emmanuel Macron, will no doubt use to nudge Europe towards his goal of greater “strategic autonomy” in the world. Some in Brussels worry that hotly contested presidential elections in April could interfere with France’s EU presidency before a key conference on the future of Europe delivers any results. It’s not reassuring that Macron’s decision, temporarily, to fly the blue and gold EU flag at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris has already drawn the fury of far-right and conservative election candidates. But many European Muslims are concerned about the French stint in the EU chair for another reason: they fear that France’s divisive anti-Muslim political discourse will seep dangerously into EU policymaking.  The French election campaign essentially means it is open season on Muslims in France. Many French politicians have adopted rampant Islamophobia as an electoral strategy. Toxic debates on Islam and Muslims, mixed with acrimonious intersectional swipes at race and migration, are becoming increasingly venomous. Alarmingly, Muslim-bashing is no longer the preserve of the far-right anti-immigration candidate Marine Le Pen. Macron’s hardline interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, accused Le Pen, during a recent television debate, of going “soft” on Islam. The former TV pundit Éric Zemmour has brought an even more vicious anti-Muslim agenda to the presidential contest, while candidate for the Gaullist Les Républicains party, Valérie Pécresse, is taking a hard line on immigration, having previously banned the wearing of burkinis at outdoor leisure centres in the Paris region. Macron himself, who is expected to seek re-election, is already enforcing a spate of anti-Muslim policies, including a bill supposedly aimed at preventing “separatism” and the emergence of a “counter society” among France’s six million Muslim citizens. Macron’s government is also under criticism for shutting down the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, a leading anti-discrimination body which documents anti-Muslim hate crimes. The European Network Against Racism warns of a full-blown “Islamophobic witch-hunt” of French Muslims and says the government is using “countless administrative procedures” to close down Muslim-led organisations, mosques, schools, and even Muslim-owned snack bars, on unproven claims of links to the Muslim Brotherhood. But the fear now is that France will use its EU presidency to push for even tougher Europe-wide measures. It’s a reasonable fear in the context of French ministers calling out Helena Dalli, the European commissioner for equality, for meeting members of Femyso, the Forum of European Muslim Youth and Student Organisations, a network that also participated in a Council of Europe anti-discrimination campaign focusing on hijabs. That campaign caused a political outcry in France as an attack on its “values”. Dalli rightly defended meeting Femyso representatives to discuss challenges facing young European Muslims as “a result of stereotyping, discrimination and outright hatred”. Attacking Dalli for the meeting, Marlène Schiappa, the citizenship minister in the Macron government, said Femyso was an “Islamist association” that was “attacking France” and “infiltrating” EU institutions, allegations which Femyso flatly denies and which its president, Hande Taner described in a statement as “laughable”. An intervention by the French government with the European Commission meanwhile prompted a delay which led ultimately to the cancellation – ostensibly for administrative reasons – of planned EU funding for another rights group, Alliance Citoyenne, which has defended the right of Muslim women to swim in public pools wearing burkinis. My own reports and articles on France and Europe written over the years note a persistent unease about Islam as an alien faith, Muslims as undesired foreigners and an irrational fear of the hijab and of halal food. Diatribes conflating Islam, extremism and terrorism are a tediously recurring phenomenon at both formal and informal gatherings. France’s Muslim-panic has parallels elsewhere. In Austria the former chancellor Sebastian Kurz took aim at the alleged rise of so-called political Islam after the launch of a much-criticised website called “Islam map” which shows the locations of more than 600 mosques. The map, according to rights groups, has led to incidents of violence against Muslims. Denmark’s former immigration minister, Inger Støjberg , was given a jail sentence recently for illegally ordering the separation of young asylum-seeking married couples from Syria and Iraq, where the woman was under 18. Seeming to implicitly link Islam and refugee policy as is often the case across Europe, Støjberg had said she wanted to protect “child brides”. She previously caused controversy by arguing that Danish Muslims be kept out of work places during Ramadan because daylight fasting could create safety hazards. Støjberg has now been impeached, and may be a political outlier, but it is hard not to see Denmark’s hardline approach to “integration” and refugees, including a June law which enables it to transfer asylum seekers outside the EU while their cases are being processed, as at least partly driven by a fear of Muslims. The Austrian academic Farid Hafez raises troubling questions too about the motivation behind the Vienna forum on countering segregation and extremism in the context of integration, an annual conference launched by Austria with the support of France and Denmark to fight “political Islam” and so-called “non-violent extremism and Islamism”. If not outright McCarthyism, as Hafez calls it, such initiatives are a dangerous step towards prejudging all Muslims as a potential threat to liberal societies. Once restricted to the EU’s far-right groups, France’s fixation with Muslims has extended across the European political landscape; Islam is seen either as a threat to national secular traditions or to the idea of “Christian Europe”. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and his EU allies have long raged against Islam, but dog whistling to anti-Muslim extremists is becoming the standard pattern for many mainstream EU conservatives. Even without chalking up any major electoral victories (so far), far-right parties have in effect succeeded in mainstreaming their hostile narrative on Muslims and migrants. No wonder hostility and discrimination towards Europe’s Muslims is widespread as the EU’s own Fundamental Rights Agency warns. The 2020 issue of the annual European Islamophobia report, co-edited by Hafez with scholars, experts and civil society activists from more than 30 European countries, concluded that anti-Muslim racism has worsened across the continent. There are bright spots. In Germany, which welcomed more than a million refugees from Syria and other countries in 2015, the new governing coalition has promised a “modern immigration country”. EU governments and the European Commission are – quite rightly – struggling against violations of the rule of law, attacks on the judiciary and the erosion of media freedoms in Hungary and Poland. But they have turned a blind eye to policies and actions that reinforce exclusion and prejudice in some western EU member states. Being a European Muslim has never been a walk in the park. With about one-third of French voters saying they will vote for far-right and ultra-nationalist candidates, France’s Islam-panic is likely to escalate in the coming months. Despite the EU’s lofty talk of equality, diversity and non-discrimination, European Muslims should be braced for a tough start to the new year.

1/4/2022,"The unusually warm spell of weather, which included record temperatures over the new year, will come to an abrupt end overnight, plunging by up to 10C (a drop of 18F) across parts of the UK. The forecast follows the hottest new year’s weekend on record when 16.5C (61.7F) was reached at Bala, Gwynedd, on 31 December 2021 – a New Year’s Eve record for the UK and Wales, when it is usually about 7C.  The Met Office has issued warnings for snow, ice and winds in northern and eastern Scotland, with the cold air affecting Scotland expected to sink south across the Pennines and into the Lake District, north Wales and the Peak District. These areas could get snow flurries. Tom Morgan, a Met Office meteorologist, said: “Compared to the 16C experienced in London over the weekend, for example, tomorrow it will likely be 6C or 7C. It’s not just the cold air which will make us feel so much colder – it’s also going to be the strength of the wind. When these factors are combined, the change will be a shock to the system.” An arctic chill will engulf most of the country by midweek, bringing frost and icy road conditions for many. “Factoring in the wind speed, in many areas of the country it will feel like -1C or -2C,” said Morgan. Northern parts of Scotland including the Highlands, Aberdeenshire and Moray are under a yellow alert for frequent snow showers and gale-force winds from 3pm until 6am on Wednesday. The Met Office warned of difficult driving conditions, especially on coastal and mountain roads. It said: “In combination with winds gusting 50 to 60mph at times, temporary blizzard conditions and some drifting of snow on higher level routes is likely.” With cold air spreading south across Scotland and bringing wintry showers, icy stretches are expected to form by late afternoon on Monday. In Orkney gusts could reach up to 80mph. ⚠️YELLOW WEATHER WARNING⚠️The @metoffice have issued a YELLOW weather warning for 🌨️SNOW🌨️ and 🌬️WIND🌬️From 00:00 (04/01) to 06:00 (05/01)More info can be found here: https://t.co/OhDOEXuFYm#TakeCare pic.twitter.com/qtOzpOzjm5 Forecasters anticipate some train or bus services could be cancelled or delayed where flooding and spray caused by heavy rain occur. Though the Met Office has only issued warnings for Scotland, commuters in England and Wales returning to work on Tuesday could also see some snow, said Morgan. “There is a band of rain that could briefly turn to sleet or snow, around breakfast time to mid-morning. Seeing flakes of snow could be a surprise for many people, given how mild it has been.” Jack Cousens, the head of roads policy for the AA, said: “A mild start to the year will suddenly become cold and blustery over the coming days, with warnings of snow and ice in the Highlands. Drivers should make sure their cars are in good condition prior to setting off. Most breakdowns can be avoided by checking fuel, oil and coolant levels while ensuring tyres are undamaged and have plenty of tread. “Preparing for the worst is worthwhile, so keeping some warm clothes and coats in the car, along with some sweets and water are recommended.” The UK Health Security Agency urged people to check on vulnerable members of the public in the coming days, including elderly people and those with serious illness. The UKHSA consultant Agostinho Sousa said: “Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections.”",News/UK news,UK weather: cold snap to bring end to unseasonal warm spell ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/uk-weather-cold-snap-end-unseasonal-warm-weather
1/4/2022,"European shares bounded to record highs in the first day of trading in 2022 as markets bet on a steady economic recovery despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant. Europe’s benchmark stock index, the Stoxx 600, rose 0.6% to hit a record high of 490.76 points on Monday morning, surpassing its November peak of 490.58, as global oil and equity markets climbed.  The Stoxx 600 recorded a 22.4% jump last year, its second-best yearly performance in over a decade, following the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and government stimulus spending encouraged investment to pour back into the markets. The London Stock Exchange (LSE), which lagged behind its European rivals by climbing 14.3% last year, was closed for the New Year’s bank holiday on Monday. The LSE’s FTSE 100 has been criticised as “out-fashioned” due its dearth of tech companies and glut of oil and bank stocks. It remained 6.5% below its May 2018 peak last year while the US, German and French markets all hit record highs. Global oil prices, which last year recorded their biggest annual rise since at least 2016, resumed their rise towards $80 a barrel as fears which emerged late last year over the impact of the Omicron variant waned. The share price of the German airline Lufthansa and Air France KLM were two of the biggest climbers across Europe’s equity markets after analysts at Citi forecast that the reopening of travel routes to Asia could help bolster the beleaguered travel sector. Lufthansa shares rose by more than 6% to €6.60 a share, and Air France KLM rose by 4.8% to €4.07. Sean Darby, a global equity strategist at Jefferies, said: “Although Covid-19 variants permeated the global economy, 2021 was the year of records with many bourses closing at or near record highs, while inflows into equities surpassed their largest accumulation ever. Peering into 2022, we expect volatility to rise.” Global oil markets are also expected to face ongoing volatility in the year ahead as traders balance the risk that the Omicron variant may stall a rebound in demand for transport fuels, against uncertain supplies from the world’s biggest oil producers. The oil price retreated at the end of 2021 following the discovery of the new variant, from just over $85 a barrel in October to narrowly below $70 a barrel a month ago. However, analysts believe that Brent crude could be on track to reach $90 a barrel in the year ahead as Covid-19 restrictions continue to fall away. Tamas Varga, from the oil broker PVM, said: “Infection rates are on the rise globally, restrictions are being introduced in several countries, the air travel sector, among others, is suffering, yet investors’ optimism is tangible. “It seems that the current strain produces less severe symptoms than its predecessors, which might just help us to struggle through the fourth wave of the pandemic.” The rising oil price is likely to spell further financial hardship for hard-pressed households in the UK, which face record high petrol pump prices and further hikes to the cost of gas and electricity bills in the months ahead. British households and businesses can expect to be hit by the highest rate of inflation for a decade, owing to the rising cost of raw materials and ongoing disruption to global supply chains, after the consumer prices index measure of inflation surged to 5.1% in November. The Bank of England has said inflation could peak at about 6% in April – three times its target rate of 2% – as energy bills are expected to almost double from record levels this winter.",News/Business,European stocks reach record highs on first day of trading in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/03/european-stocks-record-highs-first-day-trading-2022-covid
1/4/2022,"The return of a requirement in England for secondary pupils to wear face masks in class has sparked a backlash at the start of the new term, but several EU countries have already adopted the measure even for primary school children. Some Conservative MPs and parents’ groups have objected to the move, warning of a long-term impact of masks on children’s mental health and arguing that they they will have a longer-term effect on people’s ability to learn and socialise.  In countries such as France, however, where a mask mandate for pupils aged 11 and over was reimposed in November after a brief relaxation at the start of the new school year, face coverings have been compulsory in all primary schools since 15 December. The measure, previously applicable to children aged six and over only in areas with a particularly high incidence, has not so far met with significant resistance during a record-breaking surge in infections fuelled by the Omicron variant. Catherine Nave-Bekhti, the general secretary of the Sgen-CFDT teachers’ union, said the requirement was “a reasonable and logical precaution given the current dynamic of the epidemic – the objective, after all, is to close as few classes as possible”. With infections exceeding 200,000 a day, children aged six and over are also now required to wear masks in indoor places open to the public, including shops, cinemas, sports complexes, trains and buses, and outside in big cities such as Paris and Lyon. Unless the entire class has been vaccinated, Italy has also required all pupils aged six and over to wear a mask indoors at school since last year, while Greece extended the mandate to nursery school children – with masks to be changed three times a day. Belgium made mask wearing mandatory for all children over the age of six, including at school, in early December, with the health minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, saying the key lay in “stopping the engine” of viral transmission among children. Spain has also required all school children over the age of six to wear face masks in class since the start of the new academic year in September, when the country was recording the highest Covid incidence rate in western Europe. The rule has generally met little resistance, although the far-right Vox party has sought to make political capital out of opposing it, warning that continued mask wearing by children “could be counter-productive” and affect development. “Almost all children over six have worn masks without rejecting it, they’ve normalised it,” said Mireia Orgilés, the author of a study on the psychological impact of the pandemic on young people in Italy and Spain. “If we explain it to them well, they can understand it and follow the rules. A lot of the time they can accept it more easily than adults,” Orgilés told the specialist publication El Diario de la Educación. In Germany, where federal states can set their own rules, mask requirements have been reimposed as the Omicron surge looms. Masks are mandatory inside all school buildings for all age groups, but can be taken off for exams and presentations. Not all European countries have followed suit: pupils in Swedish schools are not required to wear masks. The state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said on Monday school closures were possible – but not nationwide – when term starts next week. Schools in Sweden have instead been told to take preventive measures such as spending time outdoors, emphasising good hand hygiene, avoiding crowding, and ensuring pupils stay at home if they develop coronavirus symptoms. Norway, too, does not require masks to be worn at school, although children over 12 must wear them on public transport, and Poland has so far refrained from imposing a mask mandate on pupils but warned on Monday new restrictions could be imminent. In the US, where many schools that would normally welcome students back to classrooms are delaying their start dates by a few days and mandating a negative test, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance suggests masking in schools. Policies vary radically across states, however, with more than half having no set strategy but leaving the decision up to local and county governments. Eight states, primarily in the south of the country, have moved to ban mask mandates in schools. As the Omicron variant sweeps the country, teachers were scrambling on Monday to test pupils and staff: all staff and public school students in Washington DC, for example, must upload a negative test result administered no later than Tuesday to the district’s website before class begins on Wednesday. A recent German study found that requiring children – and particularly adults – to wear face masks in schools can potentially decrease Covid-19 outbreaks at schools, since clusters were generally more severe when an adult was the source. Martina Sombetzki, the lead author, said the results showed “mandatory masking of teachers and caregivers and children at schools in the 2020 to 2021 school year each resulted in a significant reduction in the number of transmissions.”",News/World news,Masks for school students mandatory in several EU countries,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/masks-for-school-students-mandatory-in-several-eu-countries
