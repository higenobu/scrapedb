1/20/2022,"The government has abandoned plans to introduce a law that would have allowed the leader of the Democratic Unionist party to potentially “double-job” in the Stormont assembly while remaining a Westminster MP. Ahead of a debate on the legislation in the Lords on Wednesday afternoon, Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that an amendment enabling dual mandates was being withdrawn.  He was responding to a question from Simon Hoare, the Conservative MP and chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee, who had described the move as “a bad idea”. “The vast majority of people and indeed politicians across Northern Ireland believe that whatever the question, double-jobbing is not the answer. Could I urge my right honourable friend to listen to the majority and ask him not to move the government amendment in the other place later today?” Hoare said. Johnson replied: “I’m grateful to my honourable friend and I’m advised that I think the amendment in question is indeed going to be withdrawn.” The government faced an avalanche of criticism over the move, with five of the six parties in Stormont and the Labour party opposing double-jobbing. The DUP was the only Northern Ireland party to support the move, with its leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, confirming this week that he would stand in his Lagan Valley constituency if selected for May’s local assembly election. On Tuesday Labour called on the government to immediately withdraw the proposal. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Kyle, warned the party would vote against it as the government had “clearly failed the sufficient consensus” test among local parties for its passing. Donaldson told reporters on Wednesday that the party had been “willing to support this proposal because it would have enabled an MP elected to the assembly to have a transitional period up to the following general election bringing us into line with other parts of the United Kingdom”. With all parties now on election-footing in Northern Ireland, rivals lost no time putting the boot in. The Ulster Unionist party peer Reg Empey described the government decision as “a victory for positive dialogue and engagement”. In a side swipe at the DUP, he added: “You don’t have to threaten to crash the institutions for unionism to have influence with government. There is another way.” The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, described the withdrawal as a “humiliating defeat for [the Northern Ireland secretary] Brandon Lewis and the DUP”. There was “no support for politicians squatting on seats to protect their own political position”, he said.",News/UK news,Plans to allow ‘double-jobbing’ in Northern Irish politics dropped,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/19/plans-allow-double-jobbing-northern-irish-politics-dropped
1/20/2022,"Microsoft recently announced plans to purchase Activision Blizzard – one of the world’s largest video game companies – for nearly $70bn, making it the biggest acquisition in tech to date. While big tech always seems to be facing some sort of – usually well-deserved – public criticism lately, the ire has mostly focused on social media. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter executives have all had to testify before Congress about their platforms’ roles in spreading misinformation and being used as organizing tools for events like the January 6 storming of the US Capitol. This is all on top of a history of alleged labor violations, including complaints that traumatized content moderators are paid poverty wages and reports that Black employees face racial discrimination.  Video game companies mirror many of the alleged problems of social media yet have long evaded accountability, outside of the occasional attempt to ban a violent video game. This is troubling given the staggering size of the game industry, which produces more revenue than the film and music industries combined and whose biggest hits make more money in days than most entire franchises make in their lifetimes. A series of recent controversies at Activision Blizzard highlights everything wrong with the industry. The latest round of shame began with a 2021 lawsuit filed by the California department of fair employment and housing. The suit alleged that women across the company were “assigned to lower paid and lower opportunity levels” and received lower salaries than male employees for similar work. The suit also alleged a “frat boy” workplace culture in which men got drunk at work and crawled into women’s cubicles to harass them. One woman killed herself on a business trip with a supervisor who brought sex toys and lubricant with him. In early December, workers at Raven Software staged walkouts to protest what they said were the arbitrary firings of a dozen contractors. The next day at least 200 employees at Raven’s parent company, Activision Blizzard, replicated the protest. In response to the pressure, Activision Blizzard agreed to give contractors modest pay raises and paid holidays. This is all despite net earnings of $2bn the previous quarter and one of their games making the company an estimated $5m a day in revenue alone. In 2019, Activision Blizzard fired 800 workers, roughly 8% of its entire workforce, despite record net revenue the year prior. November 2021 saw rebellions from both employees and shareholders after a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Activision Blizzard’s CEO, Bobby Kotick, was aware of and failed to respond to a large number of sexual misconduct allegations, including rape, in the company. The Wall Street Journal also detailed “misconduct allegations against Mr Kotick, including [that] he threatened in a voicemail to have an assistant killed”. These are hardly isolated incidents within the industry. In 2019, over a hundred workers at Riot Games, a prominent video game company, walked out to protest an alleged environment of hostility and sexual harassment. In 2020, women began posting on Twitter about harassment, discrimination and sexual assault at video game industry companies and events; one organizer maintained a record of these stories, which have grown to a few hundred. Ubisoft, the makers of Assassin’s Creed, saw a wave of resignations and firings following stories of abuse, harassment, and the normalization of sexism and overwork within their offices. In 2021, a report by the International Game Developers Association found that 71% of survey participants “perceived inequity towards others based on gender, age, ethnicity, ability, or sexual orientation”. That same survey found that roughly a third of participants had experienced “crunch”. Crunch refers to long, often uncompensated, overtime that results in employees and contractors working between 65 and 80 hours a week. A 2019 investigation by Polygon alleged a culture of fear at Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, where some employees reportedly worked 100 hours a week. The behavior of these companies is exacerbated by the same growing monopolization afflicting social media. There seem to be fewer and fewer mid-sized video game companies, while larger companies expand and swallow competition. Activision Blizzard itself is a merger of two video game giants. Last year Microsoft’s game division, Xbox, acquired another major player, ZeniMax Media, the parent company of the developers of the Elder Scrolls games. This wave of consolidation, Bloomberg News reports, could “eventually lead to creative stagnation and other symptoms of monopolization, like limited choices and higher prices”. Electronic Arts, the owner of the Madden franchise, is a great example. The company is only able to put out such terrible football games each year because it used its wealth to maintain an exclusive contract with the league, putting any current and potential rivals out of business. Steam, by far the largest online store for PC games, has a chokehold on the market. By 2013, Steam had acquired 75% of the global market for digital PC games. This near monopoly has enabled Steam to get away with the same kind of laissez-faire moderation that allowed white supremacists to fester on Facebook. An Anti-Defamation League investigation found hundreds of neo-Nazi Steam accounts, and many posts directly referencing the Holocaust and celebrating famous fascists and mass killers. Despite Steam’s market domination, it reportedly has a tiny paid moderation team supplemented by 13 volunteer moderators. The video game industry may not yet have the same power as the leading tech juggernauts, but the industry is not to be ignored – especially considering that other titans such as Amazon, Facebook (Meta) and Google (Alphabet) have recently begun moving into the space. There is another world in which video game employees are treated with respect and dignity, those who create the games we love have control over their workplaces and the products they make, and consumers play comfortably without the presence of Nazis. Until that day comes, the industry must be as scrutinized as its more dominant siblings in tech, and it must be regulated and dismantled before it becomes a new kind of vile.

1/20/2022,"Bernie Sanders has said he may consider supporting primary challengers against colleagues Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the two Democrat holdouts in debate over whether to amend the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. The progressive Vermont senator told reporters on Tuesday that he believes “there is a very good chance” that Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, will face primary challenges because of their stance on the filibuster.  He said home-state voters would be disappointed that the pair have refused to support changing Senate rules to overcome a Republican filibuster against major voting legislation while also balking at the massive, Biden-backed spending and social plan known as Build Back Better. When asked if he would consider backing such primary challengers, Sanders replied, “Well, yeah.” Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats, didn’t elaborate on his comment, but it is unusual for senators to suggest they would be willing to campaign against colleagues from their own party. Sanders’s sentiments also lay bare progressives’ growing frustrations with the more conservative senators, Manchin and Sinema, whom the left has blamed for stalling many of Biden’s top legislative priorities. Manchin and Sinema say they support the legislation but are unwilling to change Senate rules to muscle the legislation through the chamber over Republican objections. With a 50-50 split, Democrats lack the 60 votes needed to overcome the Republican filibuster. Manchin is expected to deliver a floor speech on Wednesday afternoon outlining his position on changing chamber rules to allow voting rights legislation to move forward. Yesterday he countered Sanders’s comments, saying he would not be bothered by a primary challenger. “I’ve been primaried my entire life. That would not be anything new for me,” he said Tuesday, when asked about fellow Democrats urging voters not to back him in a primary. “I’ve never run an election I wasn’t primaried. This is West Virginia, it’s rough and tumble. We’re used to that. So bring it on.” Sanders remains one of the nation’s leading progressive voices after strong Democratic presidential primary bids in 2016 and 2020 – and is still popular enough nationally to potentially affect Senate primaries around the country. Manchin and Sinema are not up for re-election until 2024, but both could face serious primary challengers then. Democratic representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who has sharply criticized Sinema for not supporting the voting rights legislation, has not ruled out launching a challenge against her. Manchin and Sinema are also experiencing some external pressure as they resist efforts to change the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. Emily’s List, the progressive group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights and has deep ties to Democrats, said it would withhold its endorsement from Sinema because of her stance on filibuster reform. “Our mission can only be realized when everyone has the freedom to have their voice heard safely and freely at the ballot box,” Emily’s List’s president, Laphonza Butler, said in a statement released on Tuesday. Naral Pro-Choice America, which supports abortion rights and is also influential in top Democratic circles, released its own statement suggesting it would no longer support or endorse Manchin or Sinema because of their stances on the legislation. The voting rights legislation in question is the Freedom to Vote: John R Lewis Act, which civil rights activists say is vital to safeguarding American democracy as Republican-led states pass new restrictive voting laws. It would make election day a national holiday while ensuring access to early voting and mail-in ballots – both of which have become especially popular during the Covid-19 pandemic. The package also seeks to let the justice department intervene in states with a history of voter interference, among other changes.

1/20/2022,"“Ilearned more about my dad through those cards than I had my whole life,” says the son of snowboarding impresario – and the sport’s possible inventor – Jake Burton Carpenter, near the end of this biographical documentary. His father has been blinded and partially paralysed by Miller Fisher syndrome; where Carpenter once penned letters addressed “Dear Rider” to snowboarding’s swelling community, he is now reduced to scribbling half-legible pleas from his hospital bed. It induces a late swell of sympathy for a handsome maverick who, at least in this fitful portrait, had come across as distant and sometimes even a bit sharklike. Dear Rider labours in positioning Carpenter’s story as a piste-side Dogtown and Z-Boys; the rebellious upstart sport pricking the pomposity of institutionalised skiing. Its basic problem is that Carpenter – whose independent streak led him to experiment in the late 70s with creating surf and skate equivalent “Snurfer” boards – wasn’t the outsider for long. As the head of what grew into industry giant Burton Snowboards, he doesn’t seem – at least until the film’s closing stretch – wildly charismatic or inspirational. And in some ways his west coast rival Tom Sims is more prescient in hothousing the freestyle ethos that later dominated the sport rather than the more linear, ski-influenced, east-coast tradition Carpenter came out of.  At one point, Carpenter – who had purchased the 1960s patent for an early version of the snowboard to annoy Sims – proceeded to enforce his ownership with businesses in the kind of fledgling position Burton once occupied. Totally heinous, dude! It’s telling that he later describes this as a “PR fuck-up”, not an ethical one. Dear Rider doesn’t exactly ignore such tricky aspects, but soft-treading criticisms from Burton employees and understandably partial recollections from Carpenter’s wife Donna (the current CEO) don’t fully weigh the man’s character either. Carpenter died in 2019 and the film’s remit is essentially celebratory – but perhaps split loyalties are why director Fernando Villena never quite hits on a compelling dramatic throughline. Still, the film proceeds down several intriguing cultural gullies, and the snowboarding sequences are pure mainlined beauty.  Dear Rider is released on digital platforms on 24 January.",Arts/Film,Dear Rider review – soft-treading portrait of snowboarding’s one-time maverick,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/19/dear-rider-review-soft-treading-portrait-of-snowboardings-one-time-maverick
1/20/2022,"Ihave no audio or video of any of my four grandparents. As they were all born in the first decade of the last century, this is hardly surprising; they didn’t live long enough to have smartphones pointed at them. I suppose the only people of their generation recorded for posterity were those who worked in radio, film, television or music, or anyone who made the news. If your nan or gramps wasn’t some kind of celebrity, footage of them probably never existed, unless you had a cine-camera enthusiast in your bloodline. I don’t. No, this kind of remembrance was the preserve of a privileged few.  Have I missed out? Much as it’s nice to see photographs of my grandparents, if some footage did suddenly turn up, I think I’d feel uneasy about watching it. I would have to brace myself, put it like that. This has been on my mind for a while. A couple of days before Christmas, I came across a tweet by a colleague at the BBC, the news correspondent Dan Johnson. “In the last few months of his life, I recorded my dad talking about his favourite music and comedy, Desert Island Discs style,” he wrote. “It’s taken me four years to finish editing it – often in tears – but I’m so pleased I have it. Best wishes, whoever you’re missing this Christmas.” I asked him to come on my radio show to talk about it. His dad was diagnosed with cancer in his early 60s and died at the age of 63. The recording, he told me, was his dad’s idea, and came at a stage when he was receiving treatment and the outlook wasn’t totally bleak. “We didn’t do any talking about the end of life or any looking back, really – apart from this suggestion which he came up with, thankfully – because I wasn’t going to be the one to take the situation there and add any negativity,” Dan said. “Dad raised the idea that: ‘We could do this thing where I talk about the songs, the music, the albums, the comedians, shows and sketches that I’ve laughed at over the years. And that might be a nice thing for people to listen to.’” And it is a nice thing, a beautiful thing, actually, to hear Dan and his late father talking and laughing. “Just to hear his voice again is special,” he added. A listener texted in to say that before his wife died, they went to a branch of Build-A-Bear and made one for each of their four grandchildren. All were fitted with a different voice message from their grandmother telling each grandchild what made them so special. While I found this incredibly moving, I also winced. Was this too much? The word macabre sprang to mind. What would it do to those children to hear their late nan’s voice every time they picked up their bears? I suppose I’d have to ask them, but I strongly suspect they wouldn’t have it any other way. Grieving, or at least remembering our loved ones, has changed for ever. Where once we had to use our imagination to remember how those we have lost moved and sounded when they were living and breathing, now that footage is on our phones and available 24/7. While I have nothing like it of my grandparents, my kids will have plenty of film of their grandparents. And my grandchildren will have plenty of me. Quite what the poor things will make of 1,000 episodes of Working Lunch, 500 One Shows, 100 Match of the Day 2s and one Strictly Come Dancing, I know not.

1/20/2022,"With a Conservative leadership campaign appearing imminent, hopeful Tory MPs are checking their contacts and quietly ringing colleagues to gauge support – and not just the ones everyone expects. Away from Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and the other perceived favourites, here are some others who could give it a try.  The junior trade minister has been increasingly talked up as a possible candidate for those unenthused by the main contenders. While not a household name, she is far from inexperienced, having been an MP since 2005 and a minister at various times since 2014, including as international development secretary and defence secretary under Theresa May. In a slight echo of Boris Johnson, she is Brexity enough to appeal to “red wall” MPs but also socially liberal. However, she is notably less chaotic. The chief whip under May and an MP since 2005, Harper has reinvented himself on the backbenches as chair of the lockdown-rejecting and influential Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of Conservative MPs. Its policy position appeals to many of his colleagues, not to mention the Tory members who will finally choose the new leader. However, Harper would have to do notably better than last time he ran, after May’s resignation, where he came ninth out of 10 candidates in the rolling series of MPs’ ballots that whittled the choice down to a final two. Another potential candidate from the CRG wing of the party – he is its deputy chair – Baker is a long-serving backbencher, beyond a one-year stint as a junior minister, but is nonetheless a relatively well-known figure. With his now traditional if not wholly serious media prefix of “Brexit hardman”, the Wycombe MP is known for his straight-talking approach and has been a regular critic of Covid rules in the Commons. Perhaps too specialist a figure to progress far if he does run. Representing a somewhat different wing of Conservatism should he stand, the former army officer and MP for Tonbridge and Malling since 2015 supported remain in the 2016 referendum and is not associated with the Johnson strand of the party. While such views might make him a niche prospect for some fellow Tory MPs, not to mention the wider party membership, Tugendhat could present himself as a sober, policy-rich contrast to the incumbent, with added gravitas from his chairing of the Commons foreign affairs committee. Like Harper, another foiled hopeful from the 2019 contest – she finished in last place, as the choice of nine MPs – McVey does have considerable Commons experience and a string of former ministerial posts, including a brief stint as work and pensions secretary. As with her previous tilt at the job, McVey’s pitch would be that she can connect the party with working-class voters. She is the founder of the self-explanatory Blue Collar Conservatism group, which has a large number of Tory MPs signed up as supporters. While the response from many voters, not to mention a number of his own colleagues, might be “What, him again, already?” the former health secretary is nothing if not a politician with a Tigger-ish bounce in approaching even seemingly lost causes. Banished to the backbenches since his breach of Covid rules via his relationship with a friend and colleague emerged last year, Hancock may feel he has served his penance. Photos this week of him emerging from some outdoor swimming, glistening and Putin-like, did not quell the sense that he is a man, once again, on manoeuvres.",News/Politics,Who are the outside bets for Tory leader if Boris Johnson goes?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/who-are-outside-bets-tory-leader-if-boris-johnson-goes
1/20/2022,"Mobile phones were still a rarity. Shopping online was a thing of the future. The launch of football’s Premier League was looming. This was Britain in March 1992, the last time the annual inflation rate was as high as it is today. Nobody under the age of 30 can really recall when the cost of living was a pressing political issue. There have been the occasional surges, usually caused by a rise in global oil prices, but nothing to match what has happened in the past six months.  Even longer memories are needed for the time inflation hit its postwar peak in August 1975. Then the annual rate climbed above 25%, prompting a run on sterling, double-digit interest and a bailout from the International Monetary Fund a year later. For many years, it looked as if inflation was something to be read about in history books. In the late 1990s the economist Roger Bootle opened a book by asking readers to envisage “a world without perpetual inflation”, where prices would rise some years and fall in others, where in a good year pay would rise by between 2% and 3% and interest rates would fluctuate between 2% and 4%. Bootle’s book – The Death of Inflation – stirred up what he called a “hornet’s nest of criticism” at the time, but by and large what he predicted came true. By the late 1990s the period of high inflation lasting from the early 1970s to the early 1990s was pretty much over. During that two-decade period, inflation was akin to the impact of an earthquake. There was a big initial shock in 1973-4 followed by a series of aftershocks each less severe than the last. UK inflation peaked at 27% in 1975, just over 20% in the early 1980s and 11% in the early 1990s. It has never subsequently been anywhere close to 10%. Economists such as Bootle came to see the 1970s and 80s as the exception rather than the rule. Historically, periods of high inflation have tended to be during wars, when governments run the economy as hot as needed to ensure national survival and ignore the risks of overheating. The first real sustained inflationary pressure in the UK after the Napoleonic wars came when the first world war broke out. According to the Bank of England, a basket of goods costing £10 in the year of the Battle of Waterloo would have cost just £7.72 at the time of the assassination at Sarajevo. In the intervening period, inflation averaged -0.3% a year. There were reasons why the 1970s and 1980s bucked this peacetime trend. The global economy was at the end of a prolonged period of strong, sustained growth. Governments’ main economic priority was full employment. Capital controls and tariffs were deployed so countries could pursue expansionary strategies with little fear of being punished by the financial markets. Trade unions were far more powerful and could bargain for high wages to compensate their members when prices rose. Large parts of the world – China, India and the Soviet Union – were closed or only partially open economies. That world was disappearing by the early 1990s. Governments saw inflation rather than unemployment as the biggest threat. Trade union power had been diminished. Capital controls were abandoned and tariffs reduced. Above all, western consumers were starting to benefit from the cheap goods produced in China and other Asian countries. As a result, it has been clear for a while that it would take something exceptional for inflation to make a comeback. Something that would throw a spoke in the wheels of globalisation, make governments keener on self-sufficiency and persuade central banks of the need to embark on massive stimulus projects. Something like a global pandemic, for example.",News/Business,Blame Covid: why UK inflation is at its highest for 30 years | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/blame-covid-why-uk-inflation-is-at-its-highest-for-30-years
