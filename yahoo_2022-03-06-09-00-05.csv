3/6/2022,"Joe Rogan has weighed in on Cain Velasquez’s arrest, wishing the former UFC heavyweight champion used his hands instead of a weapon. On a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, the comedian and UFC commentator discussed Velasquez’s alleged actions with former UFC middleweight champion Michael Bisping. Velasquez was arrested for allegedly shooting at a man accused of repeatedly molesting a close relative “100 times,” according to reports and court documents. The 39-year-old is facing a number of charges including attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. Considering the potential motive of Velasquez’s actions, Rogan and Bisping agreed the former heavyweight champion was justified in his actions. “It’s beyond sick,” Bisping said. “That guy deserves everything what Cain did. Well, Cain actually got his father, didn’t he? Not the guy himself, sadly.” According to reports, Velasquez was chasing Harry Goularte and fired a gun several times at a truck carrying him, his mother, and stepfather. The stepfather was driving the vehicle and was the only person struck with a bullet during the incident. “I mean, my only wish is that he did it with his hands,” Rogan said. “My only wish is that he just ran the car off the road, pulled that guy out of the f*cking car, and beat him to death. F*ck you.” “And even that would have been too good for him,” Bisping added. Velasquez is currently in custody at the Santa Clara County main jail where he awaits arraignment on Monday, when the judge could decide to set bail. If convicted of attempted murder, he faces a minimum of 20 years to life in prison, including additional time if found guilty of other charges. According to a police report, Goularte, 43, was recently charged with molesting a “close relative” of Velaquez and was out on bail. “That is a sickness,” Rogan said. “There’s like a certain sickness that people have, that human beings have, as sicknesses of the mind. But that one, the molesting a f*cking baby? … The molesting children is the sickest of all of those sicknesses.”   ",U.S./MMA Junkie,"Joe Rogan wishes Cain Velasquez hadn’t shot at accused molester, ‘beat him to death’ instead",https://news.yahoo.com/joe-rogan-wishes-cain-velasquez-221608368.html
