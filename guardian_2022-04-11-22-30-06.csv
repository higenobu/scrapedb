4/11/2022,"Four years have passed since Napoli ‚Äúlost a Scudetto in the hotel‚Äù. That was how Maurizio Sarri explained things after his then team was thrashed 3-0 by Fiorentina in April 2018, effectively ending their title bid. They had begun the weekend with hopes of going top of the table but suffered an emotional collapse after watching Juventus come from behind to beat Inter the night before. The Bianconeri trailed that game as late as the 87th minute, despite playing with an extra man for more than an hour. They should have gone down to 10 themselves when Miralem Pjanic, already booked, leapt knee-first into Rafinha at the start of the second-half. Instead, an own goal from Milan Skriniar allowed them back into the match and Gonzalo Higua√≠n snatched a winner at the death. To the Napoli players watching on televisions in Florence, it felt like a dagger to the heart. One week earlier, they had beaten Juventus in Turin, closing to within a point of first. Inter‚Äôs lead had dangled the prospect of an opportunity to overtake. For Higua√≠n, their former teammate, to snatch it away, felt especially cruel. Mathematically, the title race was far from over. Napoli could maintain the one-point gap by beating Fiorentina, and Juventus‚Äôs remaining three games included a daunting trip to Roma. But in Sarri‚Äôs telling, the dream ended with Higua√≠n‚Äôs strike. He saw players ‚Äúcrying on the stairs‚Äù as he made his way up to bed. There were echoes of that story this weekend as Napoli prepared to face Fiorentina. Just like in 2018, Napoli found themselves a single point from Serie A‚Äôs summit. An impressive, and essential, 3-1 win away to Atalanta in the previous round lent fresh fuel to the Scudetto dream. Just like four years ago, they were forced to watch a title rival play before them. Inter started the weekend three points behind Napoli but with a game in hand. Their 2-0 win over Verona on Saturday effectively raised them above the Partenopei into second; they hold the head-to-head tie-breaker.

Despite wobbly recent form, Inter were clear favourites at home to mid-table opposition. Still, the result did reinforce the need for Napoli to respond with a win of their own. Luciano Spalletti has brought them closer to the summit than any manager since Sarri, but he deflected a question on Saturday about whether he had done enough to earn a Scudetto. ‚ÄúThe ones who deserve it most would be Napoli‚Äôs supporters,‚Äù said Spalletti, adding that a full Stadio Diego Armando Maradona ‚Äì possible for the first time this season with relaxation of Italy‚Äôs Covid laws ‚Äì could be ‚Äúthe missing piece of the puzzle‚Äù. He might be looking at the picture on the jigsaw box backwards. If Napoli do miss out on the title again, they will not have lost it in a hotel this time but rather in their very own home. They had already suffered four league defeats in Naples, and Sunday became their fifth. Fiorentina took the lead in the 29th minute through Nicol√°s Gonz√°lez, gave up an equaliser to Dries Mertens after half-time but then roared back to win with further goals from Jonathan Ikon√© and Arthur Cabral. Three goals, just like in 2018. Not even a spectacular late strike from Victor Osimhen could rescue Napoli from fate. The result was a fair reflection of the match. Napoli did start brightly, Osimhen sending a header narrowly off target and having another goal disallowed for offside, but Fiorentina came to control the midfield and punished moments of sloppiness. Kalidou Koulibaly, whose last-man foul on Giovanni Simeone marked the beginning of the collapse four years ago, was at fault again, appealing for a free-kick when he ought to have been closing Gonz√°lez down. In the second half, the visitors targeted Napoli‚Äôs right-back Alessandro Zanoli, making just his second senior start. Ikon√©, on as a substitute, barely had time to take his first touch before firing a shot through the 21-year-old‚Äôs legs and into the bottom corner. Zanoli was caught too high up the pitch as Napoli countered down his side again for Cabral‚Äôs winner. It was a day to celebrate the work of Fiorentina‚Äôs manager, Vincenzo Italiano, whose team finished the weekend in seventh. The January sale of Dusan Vlahovic was supposed to derail the Viola‚Äôs European ambitions. Instead, they have collected 17 points from nine games without the Serbian and are 23 better off than they were at the corresponding point last season. Italiano has achieved these results by avoiding overreliance on any one player. His Fiorentina team also won 5-2 away to Napoli in the Coppa Italia at the start of this year. All eight of their goals across the two games had a different scorer. Even so, questions must be asked of Napoli, who have played as well as anyone in Serie A this season and yet faltered in front of their own fans. They could have been leading the title race if they had not drawn with Inter and lost to Milan in Naples over the past two months. In between was a 4-2 defeat to Barcelona ‚Äì more comprehensive than the scoreline suggests ‚Äì with whom they drew with at the Camp Nou. Domestically, Napoli have not beaten a top-half team at home since they thumped Lazio in November. It is tempting to wonder whether Spalletti‚Äôs intense rhetoric has hindered them. Before the Barcelona defeat, he invoked Maradona, cheering the team on from heaven. Ahead of the loss to Milan, he told his players they must decide whether they wanted to be ‚Äúimmortal‚Äù or ‚Äúquickly forgotten‚Äù. Might some players have been better served by defusing the pressure instead of raising it? In more tangible terms, we can ask whether he is getting his tactics right. Osimhen has endured another injury-disrupted season, and Napoli‚Äôs position might look different if he had been available throughout, but too often there seems to be disconnect between him and the rest of the team. He touched the ball only 28 times on Sunday, and still produced a goal and an assist. A midfield that was a strength earlier in the season has lost its way ‚Äì with Piotr Zielinski a shadow of himself. Lorenzo Insigne had a chance to make this season a glorious send-off before leaving for Toronto but has offered little. Empoli 0-0 Spezia, Inter 2-0 Verona, Cagliari 1-2 Juventus,¬† Genoa 1-4 Lazio, Napoli 2-3 Fiorentina, Sassuolo 2-1 Atalanta, Venezia 1-2 Udinese, Roma 2-1 Salernitana, Torino 0-0 Milan Spalletti described defeat on Sunday as ‚Äúa bit of a sentence‚Äù, suggesting that time was running shor. That was before the leaders, Milan, drew with Torino. The gap to first is only two points but Inter have a chance to claim top spot if they can win their game in hand against Bologna. If Napoli do fall short, there will be other games they look back on with greater regret . Losses at home to Empoli and Spezia feel more damning than to an upwardly-mobile Fiorentina. Even so, those four-year-old echoes linger. ‚ÄúIf I could replay any one match from my career, it would be the Fiorentina-Napoli game from 2018,‚Äù said the former Napoli keeper Pepe Reina. ‚ÄúThat team deserved more.‚Äù They pushed on, all the same to a club-record 91 points. At best, Napoli can end this campaign with 84. That could be enough, but feels like a distant target for a team that cannot get comfortable in its own home.",Sport/Football,Home discomforts and Fiorentina damage Napoli‚Äôs hopes of the Scudetto | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/11/napoli-scudetto-hopes-fiorentina-football
4/11/2022,"A lacklustre French presidential election campaign overshadowed first by the Covid pandemic and then by the war in Ukraine has exploded into life, propelling Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen into what looks like being a brutal runoff. Here are five key takeaways from the first round of voting as France ‚Äì and Europe ‚Äì brace themselves for a nervous two weeks before the deciding 24 April vote that will determine who occupies the √âlys√©e Palace for the next five years. In the end it was a more comfortable victory for the outgoing president than many pollsters and commentators had predicted: Emmanuel Macron finished on 27.8% of the vote, while Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) managed 23.1%. Both scored higher than in the previous first round in 2017, but the gap between them was also wider, giving Macron a much-needed boost going into the second round after weeks when the momentum was all Le Pen‚Äôs. But although early second round polls show the president marginally ahead, the final result is far from certain. Le Pen will gain votes from the far-right TV pundit √âric Zemmour, and Macron from the more mainstream right and left and the Greens. But he will also need the backing of some who voted for the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc M√©lenchon, many of whom would rather abstain or ‚Äì although M√©lenchon urged them not to ‚Äì vote for Le Pen. The former Socialist minister came in a very close third with a significantly higher than expected 22%, and at one stage ‚Äì late in the evening as the big-city votes were being counted ‚Äì looked like he might pip Le Pen to the second round. Cementing his status as the only powerful voice on a weak and divided left, his passionate oratory and radical programme were a big hit with the young: he was far and away the most popular candidate among 18- to 34-year-old voters (who unfortunately for him were also the least likely age group to vote). He also benefited from a last-minute surge from left-leaning voters initially tempted by parties such as the Greens and the Communists but who concluded, rather too late in the day, that despite some of his more extreme policies M√©lenchon was the only leftwing candidate with a chance of making it to the second round. The radical realignment of French politics that began in 2017 when Macron swept to power at the head of his ‚Äúneither left nor right‚Äù startup reached its logical conclusion with the near-total electoral destruction of France‚Äôs two traditional parties of government, the rightwing R√©publicains and the Socialist party. On the right, Val√©rie P√©cresse scored just 4.7%; the deep divide between moderates and hardliners in her party, still a force at local level, could now see it implode. On the left, the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, managed just 1.7%, also a historic low for a party that only a decade ago controlled the √âlys√©e, parliament and most of France‚Äôs regions. In the place of the classic left-right divide has emerged a new political landscape made up of a mainstream bloc in the centre that is liberal, pro-European and globalist, and by two extremes on the right and left that are, to varying degrees and in different ways, populist, protectionist, and nationalist and/or identitarian. Roughly 53% of registered French voters who cast their ballot on Sunday voted for an anti-establishment candidate, on the right or the left. Perceived by many as ‚Äúthe president of the rich‚Äù, Macron‚Äôs challenge in the second round will to persuade enough of them that though they may dislike him, they loathe Le Pen more. The far-right leader‚Äôs relentless focus on the cost of living crisis was smart and spoke to many voters‚Äô core concerns. He will now seek to point out the incoherences in her programme, defend his economic record and paint a forward-looking picture; she will portray him as out-of-touch and a representative of the elite. Perhaps the most striking of the multiple divides between the two rivals‚Äô voters was this one, identified by the pollster Ipsos: 43% of voters who said they were ‚Äúvery satisfied‚Äù with their life voted for Macron and 21% for Le Pen, while 46% of those who said they were ‚Äúnot at all satisfied‚Äù voted Le Pen ‚Äì and just 4% Macron. Zemmour‚Äôs pro-Kremlin rhetoric come back to bite him, but Le Pen‚Äôs past cosying-up to the Russian leader (including Kremlin photo-ops, support for his annexation of Crimea, and campaign loans from Moscow banks) was quick to condemn the invasion and paid no electoral price for her previous positions. Macron initially benefited from a rally-round-the-flag polling boost at the outbreak of the war, and his shuttle and telephone diplomacy with Moscow since played well with his electoral base, for whom, polls suggest, foreign affairs tend to matter more than for voters likely to cast their ballot for Le Pen. The second round campaign may well see a renewed and rather stronger focus on the far-right leader‚Äôs past Kremlin sympathies, which some voters may be more inclined to view as a factor in a vote that Le Pen has described as ‚Äúa fundamental choice between two opposing visions of society and civilisation‚Äù.",News/World news,France election: five key takeaways and moments ahead ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/france-election-key-takeaways-emmanuel-macron-marine-le-pen-runoff-first-round-voting-presidential-race
4/11/2022,"Children think farm animals deserve to be treated as well as human beings but lose this belief in adolescence, a groundbreaking study has found. Researchers from the universities of Exeter and Oxford asked a group of British children aged nine to 11, young adults aged 18 to 21 and older men and women about their attitudes to different sorts of animals. In general, the children said farm animals and human beings should be treated the same and found eating animals less morally acceptable than both sets of adults. The findings suggest that ‚Äúspeciesism‚Äù ‚Äì a moral hierarchy that gives different value to different animals ‚Äì is learned during adolescence, according to the study. ‚ÄúHumans‚Äô relationship with animals is full of ethical double standards,‚Äù said the lead author, Luke McGuire, a lecturer at the University of Exeter who specialises in social and moral development. ‚ÄúSome animals are beloved household companions, while others are kept in factory farms for economic benefit. Judgments seem to largely depend on the species of the animal in question: dogs are our friends, pigs are food.‚Äù The report says an important aspect of the human mind is ‚Äúmoral acrobatics‚Äù: people can hold ethical values that contradict each other and employ moral double standards. But the origins of moral acrobatics relating to animals is poorly understood and the researchers say this new study provides some of the first evidence examining the differences in how children and adults think about animal treatment. Among other tasks, participants in the study were presented with pictures including a farm animal and companion animals and asked to categorise them as ‚Äúfood‚Äù, ‚Äúpet‚Äù or ‚Äúobject‚Äù. They were asked how animals were treated, and how they should be treated. Children did not judge all animals to be equal. They concluded, in fact, that dogs ought to be treated better than pigs ‚Äì but also that pigs ought not to be treated differently from humans. The two sets of adult groups said pigs ought to be treated less well than dogs, while humans and dogs ought to be treated the same. McGuire said the study suggests that while children think farm animals and humans ought to be treated equally well, by adulthood people believe that companion animals and humans ought to be treated better. He said children rated eating animals as significantly less permissible than young adults and adults did. ‚ÄúSomething seems to happen in adolescence, where that early love for animals becomes more complicated and we develop more speciesism,‚Äù said McGuire. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to note that even adults in our study thought eating meat was less morally acceptable than eating animal products like milk. So aversion to animals ‚Äì including farm animals ‚Äì being harmed does not disappear entirely.‚Äù McGuire said that while adjusting attitudes was a natural part of growing up, the ‚Äúmoral intelligence of children‚Äù could be valuable. He said: ‚ÄúIf we want people to move towards more plant-based diets for environmental reasons, we have to disrupt the current system somewhere. For example, if children ate more plant-based food in schools, that might be more in line with their moral values, and might reduce the normalisation towards adult values that we identify in this study.‚Äù The paper, published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, is titled ‚ÄúThe development of speciesism: age-related differences in the moral view of animals‚Äù.",News/World news,"Farm animals and humans should be treated the same, children say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/farm-animals-and-humans-should-be-treated-the-same-children-say
4/11/2022,"This Friday sees the beginning of Passover. It‚Äôs the liberation story of the Jewish people: the journey from slavery to freedom. I‚Äôm sitting in my dressing room ‚Äì the ‚ÄúIsherwood room‚Äù, named after the writer whose Berlin Stories gave birth to our production of Cabaret ‚Äì with 10 extraordinarily liberated people. There are more pierced nipples and ‚Äúwearable erotic accessories‚Äù in here than this sheltered man from Muswell Hill could shake a stick at. So, I keep my painfully heteronormative stick to myself. A few seats away sits my friend Matt who plays Hans in the show, a specialist in obscure sexual practices: art and life have never been more attuned. He‚Äôs wearing lederhosen and glitter, polishing some sort of leather harness. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that for?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to a club after this evening‚Äôs show, where I‚Äôm strapped on to a swing and penetrated throughout the night.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúHow extraordinary.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot really, mate. For me it‚Äôs just like shaking hands.‚Äù Well, buckle up Matt and let me tell you about the time I escaped from the original ‚Äúhouse of bondage‚Äù three and a half thousand years ago. On Passover, Jews relive the exodus from Egypt as if it were happening to us now. We don‚Äôt just tell the story, we reenact it. We gather for the Seder night and recount through story, food and song our escape from slavery under the Pharaoh ‚Äì our ‚Äúdeliverance from the house of bondage to the promised land‚Äù. It‚Äôs biblical cosplay ‚Äì with matzah. That‚Äôs the unleavened bread we eat to remind ourselves that we had to flee Egypt in the dead of night ‚Äì without time for the bread to rise ‚Äì before the Pharaoh changed his mind. And we eat bitter herbs to remind us of the tears we cried in our anguish as enslaved people. We drink wine to celebrate our escape and spill wine to remind us of the drowning of our enemies in the Red Sea and the plagues they suffered. Emotional paradoxes are a Jewish tradition. Laughter needs tears. Happiness always needs its opposing corollary. Is it an injunction or just superstition that makes us eschew unadulterated joy? Even during a wedding ceremony, at the very moment of unity, a glass is smashed to remind us of the destruction of the temple (in our production of Cabaret, there is a further link to Kristallnacht). But the Seder story makes another crucial antithetical connection, which has become part of the Jewish intellectual DNA: hope shares centre stage with caution. We recite from the Haggadah: ‚ÄúNot just Pharaoh, but in every generation there are those who rise against us to annihilate us‚Äù and every year we marvel at the pessimistic prescience of the third-century sages who wrote it. If fearing the worst is a tribal habit, drummed into us at every Passover, then the loss of that fear has also become part of our collective cautionary tale telling. My character in Cabaret, the Jewish greengrocer, Herr Schultz, like so many of his generation, assumes that the superstitious injunction to be fearful of despots no longer applies in the enlightened world of Germany. He refuses to acknowledge the growing danger. His hope that the Nazi threat will pass is not counterbalanced by the ancient tribal command to fear the worst. He shrugs off his friend Clifford‚Äôs advice to leave, and ‚Äúdramatic irony‚Äù ‚Äì the audience‚Äôs gift of hindsight ‚Äì allows us to assume the worst fate befalls him. To have hope and ignore its lurking shadow is not a recipe in the Jewish cookbook. But if the Seder is a sort of preparedness drill, an annual escape dress-rehearsal, then the message is not lost on us this year. As we were rehearsing and discussing Schultz‚Äôs naive optimism, the thought of a Russian invasion would be dismissed as alarmism, even though Putin‚Äôs troops were amassing on the border. Ukrainians went about their daily business. Greengrocers sold their fruit. Weeks later, and the booby-trapped bodies of Bucha make the 10 plagues of the Passover story seem tame. Unimaginable horrors are being perpetrated by the capricious hand of this generation‚Äôs Pharaoh. And we are unprepared. Hope has lost its bedfellow. The Passover Seder is an evening of paradoxes. It is prophetic and discomforting, while also a joyous meal of celebration and ancient drinking games. Wine is drunk leaning to the left to mimic Roman aristocrats and glasses must be filled, finished, and refilled according to a set plan that no one has ever agreed on. We even have an extra cup of wine for Elijah the prophet: we open the front door and sing a song to welcome in Eliyahu Hanavi ‚Äì the eternally wandering Jew, the forever refugee, the stranger in a strange land ‚Äì to seek asylum in our home. Children stare at the glass to see if he has taken a sip while the adults gently knock the table. But Elijah isn‚Äôt just a Jewish Santa to keep the kids awake. Yes, he is the bringer of good news and joy but also the spectre at the feast. As the door opens, we feel the chill wind of reality. Elijah speaks for all of Earth‚Äôs wanderers, all those looking for shelter. With millions of Ukrainians fleeing war, his arrival is salutary. Today‚Äôs exodus doesn‚Äôt require historical reenactment at the Seder meal. It is playing out in real time and despite the thousands of people signing up to host refugees, scandalously few have made it to a place of greater safety. This year, maybe because my character Herr Schultz failed to escape, I will be thinking about a man who succeeded. A Ukrainian, also called Elijah, who listened to the ancestral warning of Passover and made the decision to flee his home town of Kyiv, after two of his brothers were killed because a new despot had arisen with a taste for violence, just like the Pharaoh. He was lucky enough to find asylum in the UK. But, however current his story sounds, this was a long time ago. Elijah Zivatovsky of Kyiv was my grandfather. There is an exodus in every generation. So, when we open the door during the Seder meal for Elijah the prophet we welcome in the original time-traveller. He comes from another time to shake us out of our docility and acquiescence. He enters the party like an embodiment of relativity. The personification of history repeating itself. Here to unsettle us and call us to action. Can we call ourselves free if others are still in bondage?‚Äô I notice that Matt has stopped his polishing. ‚ÄúFascinating stuff, Elliot. Seder night sounds like a lot of fun.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you join us on Friday after the show, if you‚Äôre not too tied up?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there with knobs on,‚Äù says Matt.

4/11/2022,"The Conservative Sir David Amess, 69, was one of the longest-serving MPs, having first been elected for Basildon in 1983 and then for Southend West in 1997. A long-term Eurosceptic, he supported Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum and tweeted a picture of a lifesize cardboard cutout of Margaret Thatcher on the day the UK left the European Union. A father of five, he was born in Plaistow, Essex and became a primary school teacher in Bethnal Green, east London after graduating in economics and government from what is now Bournemouth University. He later became a recruitment consultant. On Monday, Ali Harbi Ali, 26 was convicted at the Old Bailey of his murder and plotting to attack other MPs, including Michael Gove. Initially elected as a councillor to the London borough of Redbridge, after winning the Basildon seat Amess served as parliamentary private secretary to Michael Portillo for 10 years. When, against the odds, he held the marginal Basildon seat in 1992, it was the first clear demonstration that Labour would not win that election. He later wrote a book about his experiences, entitled 1992: Against All Odds, which was launched in the Commons at an event to mark the 20th anniversary of the election. Before the 1997 election, with a boundary review dividing Basildon, he was selected for Southend West. Amess‚Äôs ambition from the age of 11 was to become an MP. Although he did not serve as a minister, or hold positions as a Conservative spokesperson, he was well known for his campaigning from the backbenches. Issues close to his heart included animal welfare, and he was one of the few Tory MPs in favour of a foxhunting ban. Fuel poverty was another area he had been active in addressing. While serving on the health select committee from 1998 until 2007 he campaigned on various issues, including obesity and endometriosis. A devout Catholic, Amess had been described as one of parliament‚Äôs most dedicated anti-abortion activists. He was knighted in the 2015 new year honours list for political and public service. Most of his campaigning efforts in recent years were associated with the Essex coastal town he represented, including his long-running campaign to make Southend a city. In December 2019, he secured an adjournment debate in the Commons specifically on the topic, telling MPs: ‚ÄúI am not messing about. We have got it from the prime minister that Southend is going to become a city ‚Äì and it will become a city.‚Äù A proposed marina and the airport were among his supporting arguments. He saw the Queen‚Äôs platinum jubilee next year as another opportunity, asking in November 2020 for a new statue of the Queen and for a city status competition to ensure Southend got the recognition he believed it deserved. Another campaign he supported was for a memorial to Dame Vera Lynn on the white cliffs of Dover. Addressing a short debate on the future of Southend hospital in 2017, he spoke of the ‚Äúrudeness‚Äù he experienced during that year‚Äôs election campaign. ‚ÄúThe things that people now say, young, middle-age or old, to we the politicians, who take the blame for decisions of bureaucrats and others who are paid twice as much as we are, frankly, but the way they can use the word F, C and all the rest of it disgusts me,‚Äù he said. Amess recently wrote of how MPs had received security advice about holding surgeries, and how attacks had ‚Äúspoilt the great British tradition‚Äù of the voters meeting politicians. In Ayes & Ears: A Survivor‚Äôs Guide to Westminster, which was published in November, he wrote about Jo Cox‚Äôs murder in 2016 and how she had been attacked ‚Äúin the most barbaric fashion imaginable‚Äù, and about the 2000 sword attack on Nigel Jones MP, which resulted in the death of Jones‚Äôs aide Andy Pennington as he tried to protect him. ‚ÄúWe all make ourselves readily available to our constituents and are often dealing with members of the public who have mental health problems. It could happen to any of us,‚Äù Amess wrote. ‚ÄúWe regularly check our locks and many others have CCTV cameras installed, but probably the most significant change has been with constituency surgeries.‚Äù Amess and his wife, Julia, who is a part-time caseworker for her husband, had four daughters and a son. Their eldest daughter, the actor Katie Amess, was critical of her father‚Äôs stance on gay rights after he defied his friend David Cameron to vote against same-sex marriage. The MP and his three-year-old French bulldog Vivienne were running in the forthcoming Westminster Dog of the Year Show, which promotes responsible dog ownership. ‚ÄúEvery time I walk into the room Vivienne throws herself at me, lies on her back with her legs in the air to be tickled. But before that she always brings a toy so she is of a generous, giving nature,‚Äù he told his local newspaper website. He also regularly judged at local dog shows and supported various local animal charities.

4/11/2022,"The actor Sam Elliott has apologised for comments he made last month about Jane Campion‚Äôs western The Power of the Dog. While speaking with Marc Maron on the latter‚Äôs WTF podcast, Elliott had described the film as a ‚Äúpiece of shit‚Äù western with ‚Äúallusions of homosexuality‚Äù. Elliott, 77, compared the cowboy characters in the film to male strippers and questioned New Zealander Campion‚Äôs credentials in making the movie: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck does this woman from down there know about the American west?‚Äù Speaking on Sunday during an event for Deadline, Elliott claimed that he had told Maron ‚ÄúCampion was a brilliant director‚Äù but went on to say he wanted to ‚Äúapologise to the cast ‚Ä¶ brilliant actors all. ‚ÄúAnd in particular Benedict Cumberbatch. I can only say that I‚Äôm sorry and I am.‚Äù Elliott said that he wanted to discuss the film, but that he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt very articulate about it‚Äù. ‚ÄúAnd I said some things that hurt people and I feel terrible about that. The gay community has been incredible to me my entire career. Friends on every level and every job description up until today. I‚Äôm sorry I hurt any of those friends and someone that I loved. And anyone else by the words that I used.‚Äù Reaction to Elliott‚Äôs comments was universally contemptuous, with many surprised the actor had apparently failed to realise some films are not shot in their exact settings. Campion later responded to Elliott‚Äôs comments: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs really unfortunate and sad for him because he‚Äôs really hit the trifecta of misogyny and xenophobia and homophobia,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that. I think he was being a little bit of a b-i-t-c-h.

4/11/2022,"The Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer‚Äôs visit to Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday is intended to tell the Russian president that he has ‚Äúlost the war morally‚Äù, Austria‚Äôs foreign minister has said, as the EU discusses how to impose sanctions on Russian oil. On a day of brisk diplomatic activity, Nehammer is due to become the first western leader to meet Putin since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. In Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers are discussing how to help Ukraine further, while Joe Biden will hold talks with Narendra Modi, where the US president is expected to press India‚Äôs leader not to increase exports of Russian crude. Austria‚Äôs foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, said someone needed to tell Putin the truth. ‚ÄúIt makes a difference to be face to face and tell him what the reality is: that this president has de facto lost the war morally,‚Äù Schallenberg said ahead of the meeting with his EU counterparts. ‚ÄúIt should be in his own interest that someone tells him the truth. I think it is important and we owe it to ourselves if we want to save human lives.‚Äù Nehammer said Ukraine‚Äôs president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he met on Saturday, had been informed of his Moscow trip, as had the EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Turkey‚Äôs president, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Austria, which is not a member of Nato, is calling for humanitarian corridors, a ceasefire and the full investigation of war crimes. Lithuania‚Äôs foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, sounded sceptical about further talks with Putin, after a series of high-profile visits by EU leaders failed to deter the Russian leader from launching his attack. He said: ‚ÄúI have seen a lot of effort by many leaders, by Emmanuel Macron, to try and see whether they can talk to the guy. I personally have no reason to believe that he is ‚Äòtalkable‚Äô.‚Äù The visit comes as Zelenskiy warned that Russian troops would move to ‚Äúeven larger operations‚Äù in the east of Ukraine. In his nightly video address on Sunday, Zelenskiy also accused Russia of trying to evade responsibility for war crimes. ‚ÄúWhen people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologise, adapt to reality and learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this,‚Äù he said. Zelenskiy said he had discussed with Scholz how to strengthen sanctions against Russia, adding: ‚ÄúI am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favour of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical.‚Äù Russia said on Monday that it had destroyed air defence systems in Ukraine over the weekend, in what appeared to be a renewed push to gain air superiority and take out weapons Kyiv has described as crucial, before a broad new offensive in the east. Germany‚Äôs foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said there were ‚Äúmassive indications of war crimes‚Äù, adding that while ‚Äúthe courts will have to decide‚Äù, it was ‚Äúcentral to secure all evidence‚Äù. EU ministers met Karim Khan, chief prosector of the international criminal court in The Hague, and Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine‚Äôs chief prosector, who is tasked with overseeing nearly 2,000 cases of war crimes committed by Russian occupying forces. Several ministers confirmed the EU was drawing up further sanctions against Russia, targeting lucrative oil sales, although it remains unclear how quickly the bloc will move in cutting imports of Russian crude. The EU is banning Russian coal from August, but Germany opposes an immediate oil embargo. Ireland‚Äôs foreign minister, Simon Coveney, confirmed that the European Commission, which is responsible for the sanctions proposals, was ‚Äúnow working on ensuring that oil is part of the next sanctions package‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe European Union is spending hundreds of millions of euros on importing oil from Russia, that is certainly contributing to financing this war. We need to cut off that financing,‚Äù Coveney said. ‚ÄúThe sooner that can happen the better.‚Äù The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, said: ‚ÄúI think we might make progress when it comes to oil. We are constantly developing our positions and more countries are understanding how important this is.‚Äù The bloc, which imports 27% of its oil from Russia, is likely to argue over the phaseout period. Germany has pledged to phase out Russian coal and oil by the end of the year, but said ending dependence on Russian gas would take until at least 2024. Referring to these plans, Baerbock said: ‚ÄúWe need a joint, coordinated plan to completely phase out fossil fuels, to be able to withdraw as a European Union.‚Äù The EU‚Äôs chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, deplored the ‚Äúbrutal, brutal aggression of Russian troops against the civilian population‚Äù, but declined to elaborate on further EU action against Russia, stating: ‚Äúsanctions are always on the table.‚Äù The US, which has been pressing Berlin to sever Russian energy ties, is expected to make the same argument to India later on Monday. India has not imposed sanctions on Russia. Taking advantage of low prices, India has bought 13m barrels of Russian crude oil since the invasion of Ukraine began, compared with 16m barrels in all of 2021, according to Reuters. Biden has accused India of being the only ‚Äúsomewhat shaky‚Äù country on Ukraine in the Quad group of nations, which includes Japan and Australia. ‚ÄúPresident Biden will continue our close consultations on the consequences of Russia‚Äôs brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating its destabilizing impact on global food supply and commodity markets,‚Äù the White House said in a statement. As western sanctions continue to bite, a Kremlin spokesperson said there were no objective grounds for a Russian debt default and that such an outcome would occur only if engineered by others.",News/World news,Austrian chancellor to tell Putin he has ‚Äòlost the war morally‚Äô,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/austrian-chancellor-to-tell-putin-he-has-lost-the-war-morally
4/11/2022,"When Daniel Wilcox read the tweet ESPN‚Äôs Adam Schefter posted to break the news of NFL quarterback Dwayne Haskins‚Äô death, he thought about how some view athletes as mere entertainers without taking the time to see them as human. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in the NFL, you‚Äôre just a piece of meat. You‚Äôre a name and you‚Äôre a number,‚Äù says Wilcox, who played tight end for the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Baltimore Ravens. Schefter caught backlash after listing Haskins‚Äô career setbacks while reporting on his death, which occurred when the 24-year-old was hit by a truck in the early hours of Saturday morning. ‚ÄúDwayne Haskins, a standout at Ohio State before struggling to catch on with Washington and Pittsburgh in the NFL, died this morning when he got hit by a car in South Florida, per his agent Cedrick Saunders,‚Äù Schefter tweeted. ‚ÄúHaskins has a family, and they‚Äôre hurting,‚Äù says Wilcox. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pointing out a flaw in someone instead of embracing the fact that someone has just lost their life. There‚Äôs a level of insensitivity. With being a reporter, sometimes you want to be the first one to get it out and you don‚Äôt think about the people that you affect when you say things.‚Äù The sports community spoke out against Schefter‚Äôs tweet, which was posted at a time when Haskins‚Äô family, friends, and former teammates were taking in the enormity of his death. Schefter would eventually delete the tweet, but the damage was done. How about ‚Äú Dwayne Haskins, son, husband, buckeye brother, friend, beloved teammate has passed away‚Äù TF his career ups and downs have to do with him unfortunately losing his lifeü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è STFU! Let his family & friends grieve instead of throwing shade. Praying for the Haskins family!! pic.twitter.com/gb1D9KcgCQ Athletes such as Dez Bryant, Lamar Jackson, and former Ohio State University quarterback Cardale Jones all lashed out at Schefter on social media with Jones tweeting: ‚ÄúHow about ‚ÄòDwayne Haskins, son, husband, buckeye brother, friend, beloved teammate has passed away‚Äô TF his career ups and downs have to do with him unfortunately losing his life.‚Äù Haskins was with the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time of his death. Ryan Clark, a former Steelers defensive back who now works with Schefter at ESPN, says the writer has apologized to him directly for the tweet. But, as of Monday morning, Schefter has yet to give a public apology. This is not the first time Schefter has appeared to be more excited about breaking news that thinking about people‚Äôs humanity. When a grand jury decided not to indict Deshaun Watson on sexual assault charges earlier this year, Schefter‚Äôs tweet read like a PR statement for the quarterback: ‚ÄúThis is why Deshaun Watson, from the beginning, welcomed a police investigation: He felt he knew that the truth would come out.‚Äù Many pointed out that a failure to indict is not a proclamation of innocence and that Watson is still under investigation by the NFL and in civil lawsuits over allegations of sexual misconduct made by 22 women. On that occasion Schefter apologized for his ‚Äúpoorly worded‚Äù tweet. Schefter was not the only person who acted like an NFL scout in the wake of Haskins‚Äô death. Former Dallas Cowboys executive Gil Brandt sounded like he was assessing a college player‚Äôs suitability for the NFL rather than speaking about the death of a young man when he appeared on the NFL‚Äôs SiriusXM channel. ‚ÄúHe was a guy that was living to be dead ‚Ä¶ Maybe if he stayed in school a year he wouldn‚Äôt do silly things [like] jogging on a highway,‚Äù Brandt, who subsequently apologized, said. Jason Wright, former NFL running back and president of the Washington Commanders, shared his thoughts on Brandt‚Äôs statement by tweeting, ‚ÄúThere is a pervasive, trite and false narrative about athletes, especially NFL and NBA, that great athleticism cannot come with great intellect and character. It subjugates men, pushing the idea that they are worth nothing apart from the arena. It has deep roots and it‚Äôs harmful.‚Äù Beyond the blunders of those in the media, there are notable instances where dehumanization has served as a practice in the NFL. For decades, the NFL used ‚Äúrace-norming,‚Äù which assumed that Black players possessed a lower baseline of cognitive abilities. In turn, it was harder for retired Black players to receive compensation based on mental declines linked to their playing days. In response to a lawsuit by former NFL players, the NFL implemented a plan in March to eliminate racial bias in testing and payout. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to pay for your health insurance when you‚Äôre done,‚Äù Wilcox says. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to care for your broken bones. They don‚Äôt care about your torn ligaments. The surgeries you have while you are playing for them, they don‚Äôt care. All they care about is what they can do to get you on the field to help them win. They want you to make them more money and continue to bring in billions of dollars to the organization.‚Äù It was left to other athletes and those who knew and loved Haskins to step in and remind us that we didn‚Äôt lose a football player this weekend, we lost a person. Steelers linebacker TJ Watt remembered that Haskins ‚Äúwas always making people smile, never taking life for granted.‚Äù His head coach Mike Tomlin said that Haskins ‚Äúwas one of our hardest workers, both on the field and in our community‚Äù Even Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder, perhaps the least sympathetic figure in the NFL, managed to give Haskins the humanity others could not. ‚ÄúHe was a young man with a tremendous amount of potential who had infectious personality. To say we are heartbroken is an understatement,‚Äù Snyder and his wife Tanya said in a statement. But it was an athlete from another sport, New York Mets slugger Pete Alonso, who himself was nearly killed in a car accident earlier this year, who reminded us that we are all as vulnerable as Haskins. ""That could have easily been me.""Pete Alonso says when he heard the news of Dewayne Haskins' death today, he flashed back to his car accident last month and how close a call it was for him: pic.twitter.com/qx3jnTgcrY ‚ÄúThat could have easily been me,‚Äù Alonso said following the Mets game against the Washington Nationals on Saturday. ‚ÄúEveryone that is above ground should be thankful for another day. Life is fragile, but we should all count our blessings if we are on the right side of the dirt. It‚Äôs an emotional thing to go through something like that, and I feel so bad for not just [Haskins‚Äô] teammates, but also his family.‚Äù Alonso was right. Haskins wasn‚Äôt just a quarterback. Like all of us, he was a human.

4/11/2022,"Shanghai authorities will start easing lockdown in some areas on Monday, despite reporting a record of more than 25,000 new Covid cases in the country‚Äôs most populous city and one of its most significant financial centres. The metropolis of nearly 26 million people will allow what city official Gu Honghui said was ‚Äúappropriate activity‚Äù in some neighbourhoods where there have been no positive cases for at least two weeks. Residents of these neighbourhoods are not allowed to travel to those still under severe lockdowns. ‚ÄúEach district will announce the specific names of the first batch [of communities],‚Äù Gu told a news briefing. It is unclear how many residents stand to have lockdowns immediately eased. On Monday, Shanghai reported a record high combined number of cases for the previous 24 hours, with 914 symptomatic cases and 25,173 asymptomatic. For Saturday, the authorities reported 1,006 cases with symptoms and 23,937 without. Frustration has continued to grow across Shanghai. Online, harrowing tales of residents unable to access medical resources on time have been shared multiple times. Affected residents posted pleas for help with medical facilities and complaints about difficulties in buying food. They ranged from well-connected celebrities to working-class citizens. On Monday, Lang Hsien-ping, a well-known TV pundit, reported on Weibo that his 98-year-old mother had died while waiting for her Covid test results in hospital. According to regulations, patients have to be clear of Covid infections before being able to receive treatment during this period. ‚ÄúMy mother left us for ever after waiting four hours (for her Covid test results) at the door of the emergency room,‚Äù Lang wrote on Weibo. ‚ÄúI wanted to see her for the last time, but because my neighbourhood has been sealed off, I spent a long time communicating with relevant departments before they allowed me to go to the hospital.‚Äù Lang said he was then unable to hail a taxi on the streets because the city was under lockdown, meaning he did not manage to bid farewell to his mother. ‚ÄúIt was an avoidable tragedy,‚Äù he wrote. Over the weekend, a 19-minute recording of a Shanghai couple being forced to move to a centralised quarantine facility was posted on WeChat. In it, the couple were told by the local centre for disease control (CDC) that they were Covid-positive, but they insisted they were not, as their test reports showed. The exchange ended with the CDC representative threatening to enforce the decision against the couple‚Äôs will. As news of Shanghai residents struggling to buy food spreads across China, in recent weeks residents in other provinces have reportedly rushed to stockpile goods. Multiple ‚Äúsurvival guides‚Äù have been shared on social media in the past few days as people in other parts of China watched the plight of Shanghai with shock. This was certainly the case in my supermarket in Beijing today. There were far more people than normal, and everyone seemed to be filling one or even two carts.https://t.co/CBgZ21dhPm via @scmpnews The situation in Shanghai also prompted other Chinese cities to take a zero-risk approach to Covid. On Monday, the southern city of Guangzhou cancelled in-person classes at elementary and middle schools and shifted them online. The measures were taken after more than a dozen cases were found, and the authorities said they would last for at least a week. On Friday, Dr Zhong Nanshan, the country‚Äôs top respiratory diseases expert, criticised the city for its under-preparedness. ‚ÄúThe measures for prevention and control [of the Covid outbreak] in Shanghai were not sufficient, and there was insufficient understanding of the transmission characteristics of the Omicron variant,‚Äù he was quoted as saying in a university webinar.
