4/23/2022,"Samantha Bee tore into Tucker Carlson’s new documentary The End of Men, which panics about a perceived decline in masculinity. “Man, you’ve got to love a documentary that has the same energy as an ad for toilet wipes for insecure dudes,” Bee said on Thursday evening. The Fox News host’s new film “apparently claims that men are physically weaker than they used to be, which translates to weaker political leadership”, Bee explained. “Clearly he hasn’t seen Nancy Pelosi doing reps at Gold’s Gym. She can bench-press a McConnell and a half.” But the weak men logic is “not the most ridiculous argument made in the film”, Bee continued. That would be Carlson’s endorsement of testicle tanning. “Oh no, don’t! The left would hate it if conservatives began sunburning their balls,” Bee deadpanned. “Testicle tanning” is actually LED red-light therapy, which has little scientific evidence to support Carlson’s claim that it improves testosterone levels. “At best, these dudes will have smooth, even-toned dongles that will be red carpet ready,” Bee joked. Carlson’s testicle tanning panic is a continuation of his bogus “war on masculinity” rhetoric for years, from segments on declining sperm counts to women earning more money and concerns over women’s IQ scores. “Tucker’s obsession reflects a larger trend. Rightwing politicians claim masculinity is under constant attack by our modern world,” Bee explained. “Republicans’ obsession with desperate, overcompensating masculinity led us to this dipshit,” she later added, referring to Donald Trump. “Republicans love Trump because this is what being a man is to them: never admit a mistake, never apologize and never give a shit about anyone else.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers mocked Rudy Giuliani’s appearance on Fox’s competition show The Masked Singer, which finally aired his reveal on Tuesday. “That’s a terrible, terrible thing to do to people on 4/20,” said Meyers. When Trump’s former lawyer was finally unmasked, “everyone was shocked, including apparently Rudy himself”, Meyers continued. Host Nick Cannon commented that “everyone was surprised to see you here” given the “controversy” surrounding him (like, you know, trying to undermine US democracy by overturning the 2020 election). Giuliani replied: “Me too!” “I’m sure he was surprised,” said Meyers. “There’s a good chance Rudy genuinely did not know where he was and was just as surprised as everyone else when they opened that box. “I bet you could trick Rudy Giuliani into climbing into almost any container just by telling him there’s a trove of shredded ballots in there or, I don’t know, a bottle of scotch that wasn’t completely empty,” he added. “The idea that any TV show would help rehabilitate a key figure in an attempted coup for entertainment purposes is so disgusting and shocking,” Meyers continued. “The only reality show I would’ve been OK with Rudy being on is Love is Blind, just to see if he accidentally ends up marrying his cousin again.” Rudy Giuliani gets voted off The Masked Singer, which means he'll spend the next five years claiming he actually won The Masked Singer. pic.twitter.com/BcaLGrgwjC Giuliani is “the lawyer who makes all his clients look innocent by comparison”, said Trevor Noah on Thursday’s Daily Show. And since his role in Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, the former mayor of New York City has largely disappeared from public view, “like a snail retreating into its shell, but way more disgusting”, said Noah. Now that he’s been voted off the Masked Singer, Giuliani will “spend the next five years claiming that he actually won The Masked Singer”, Noah quipped. “History was made last night, because for the first time in The Masked Singer’s history, a contestant took off their mask and everyone was like, ‘No, no, put it back on,’” he joked. “It’s also weird how Rudy has the time to be on a gameshow, but he’s ‘too busy’ to testify in front of Congress,” Noah added. “Like, maybe they should’ve tricked him. Congress should’ve made themselves look like The Masked Singer, combine the whole thing. Pop him in the giant costume and sit him in front of the January 6 committee. He’d do it! That’s the gameshow America needs.” Giuliani’s appearance on The Masked Singer was “very bad”, said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday. “They finally get a Republican to wear a mask and that’s how it goes.” Kimmel recapped the disastrous episode, whose reveal prompted celebrity judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke to walk off stage in protest. As a clue to the judges guessing his identity, a masked Giuliani said he gets “put in a box a lot”. “Oh, because he’s a vampire, right?” Kimmel responded. “The coffin he sleeps in, that’s the box. They put him in a box in the parking lot of a dildo store, right? “I mean, I know it’s Fox, but I still can’t believe they did this,” he concluded. “Rudy Giuliani tried to overthrow our government!

4/23/2022,"It is customary to solemnly declare that “form goes out the window” in football derbies, but as the players of Frank Lampard’s Everton gird their loins before Sunday’s trip across Stanley Park to Anfield, The Fiver isn’t so sure this will be the case. Sure, when push comes to shove, it’s 11 highly gifted footballers against 11 and anything could happen, but in terms of form, we’re struggling to envisage a scenario in which Sadio Mané and Luis Díaz repeatedly trip over their own feet while behind them Alisson keeps shanking clearances over the roof of the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand. As for FLE? Well, colour us cynical this Spring Friday afternoon, but despite the men from Goodison Park having scraped four points from the previous six available against Manchester United and Leicester respectively through a deflected shot and late, late mis-kick, The Fiver finds it implausible to imagine they’re going to rock up to Anfield doing anything resembling a passable impersonation of 1970s Brazil. Currently more Big Sam than samba, the pressure has been well and truly ramped up on FLE in the wake of Thursday night’s events in Lancashire. In case you missed it – and given if it was a Thursday night fixture at Turf Moor between Burnley and Southampton, you almost certainly did – the home side won to leave them just a point behind Everton in the battle for Premier League survival. What’s more, if Burnley can do a number on Wolves on Sunday, FLE will start the 240th Merseyside derby in the relegation zone. In a game that both teams desperately need to take something from for wildly different reasons. Liverpool require three points to maintain their tilt at a quintuple of League, Milk Cup, Big Cup, FA Cup and FLE Being Relegated. The Toffees would happily take a share of the spoils to help them avoid making what is already shaping up to be an unprecedented season of success for Reds on Merseyside that little bit better. “I’m a realist,” said FLE manager Frank Lampard at his pre-match presser. “You understand the position we’re in. I’ve played Liverpool, managed against Liverpool – it’s always daunting because you respect the level of player and manager they have. It’s a slightly different type of test, it’s why we’re in this game.” On the subject of respect for the manager Liverpool have, Lampard was asked about the time he told Jürgen Klopp to “eff off and sit down” during a touchline spat at Anfield back in 2020. “All of us get it wrong at times,” honked Lampard, in a state of affairs that suggests he’s never got involved in a debate on Social Media Disgrace Twitter. “It was just a bit misguided from my point of view. I have seen Jürgen since then and everything is fine. We all move on because we understand what this game does to you at times.” Wise words indeed.

4/23/2022,"At an underground sports centre in central Helsinki, a group of teenagers were playing floorball, a type of hockey popular in the Nordic country during the long winter months. Not far behind one of the goals, a small door led to the “control room”, a dimly lit space with large oxygen systems and electricity generators. If the worst fears of Europe materialise and Moscow’s war in Ukraine spills across the continent to other neighbours of Russia, sports centres like these can quickly be turned into emergency bomb shelters ready to accommodate thousands of Finns. “I sleep much better at night knowing we have these bomb shelters. Especially now with what is happening in Ukraine,” said Tomi Rask, a safety instructor of Helsinki’s Civil defence centre who was leading the tour of the bomb shelter, which can host up to 6,000 people. Rask said Finland first started to build an extensive network of bomb shelters in the 1960s, partly stemming from its experience of fighting the Soviet Union in the winter war of 1939. As the country has not seen any military action since 1945, the bomb shelters have been used as sports facilities, swimming pools, car parks and storage. But the defence strategy of Finland, which has a 1,340km (830-mile) border with Russia, has come under renewed focus since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February, triggering the biggest geopolitical crisis in Europe since the second world war. Finland this week started discussions about joining the US-led Nato military alliance while its foreign minister told the Guardian his country had real concerns about the prospect of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. “I don’t want to brag, but the Finnish bomb shelter technology is one of the best. We have been doing this for a while,” Rask said, pointing to the two massive steel doors at the entry of the shelter, that he said would withstand heavy bombardment – including nuclear – as well as chemical attacks. Rask said all buildings in the country above a certain size had to have their own bomb shelters, estimating there were approximately 5,500 civil defence shelters with roughly 900,000 places in Helsinki alone, more than the capital’s population. “These shelters can protect against practically any bombing or chemical attacks. We have water, clean air and beds that can people going for weeks.” The shelter was maze-like, with different rooms popping into view as we walked through, including a cafeteria and a children’s playroom. “It was built like this on purpose,” Rask said, “Studies have shown that people react better to rooms that have walls, where there are boundaries that create a sense of privacy.” Rask’s face dropped when asked whether the events in Ukraine have impacted the work of the city’s civil defence, the unit responsible for looking after the shelters. “It’s sad to see what is happening in Ukraine. I see the poor people hiding in the metro or in theatres. It shows again how important it is what we do.” But the vast shelter network is just one of the components of what Finland calls its strategy of “comprehensive security” that has started to attract attention following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For decades, the country has engaged with every level of society to prepare for the possibility of conflict with its neighbour, said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a security expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “Russia is never specifically mentioned, but it has always been understood that the country should be prepared to make the threshold for a Russian attack as high as possible.” Finland, a country of 5.5 million people, can muster a wartime army of 280,000 personnel, while in total it has 900,000 trained reservists. Helsinki has maintained its high level of defence spending even as others cut in the 1990s and 2000s after the fall of the Soviet Union. The country recently announced it would replace its ageing combat jets with 64 F-35 planes and weapons systems in a deal worth £6.97bn. Salonius-Pasternak said it was “symbolic” that the country’s leadership pushed through with the pricy purchase of the jets just as the pandemic hit in 2020. “We had no idea at the beginning of the pandemic how bad it was going to get, what it will do to our economy. But then our prime minister came out and said that the deal will go ahead signalling that the country’s security is paramount.” Finland has also continued with conscription for all male school-leavers even after the end of the cold war when many other European nations ceased the practice. “It was a great bonding experience,” said Jon Lehtinen, 24, a student from Helsinki, who finished his year of service last year. “At the same time, it gives you a sense of social responsibility. We are a small nation and every pair of hands could one day be important.” But despite the countrywide efforts to bolster its security, Salonius-Pasternak stressed that Finland, which frequently ranks as one of the happiest countries in the world, was the opposite of a “militarised society”. “It is only natural you bring a rain jacket when there could be clouds.”",News/World news,Ukraine war puts new focus on Finland’s network of bunkers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/how-finland-bunker-mania-made-sense
4/23/2022,"As Boris Johnson met Narendra Modi on Friday morning, he joked of the enthusiastic welcome he received in the Indian prime minister’s home state of Gujarat featuring giant posters of the British leader’s face, and flag-waving crowds: “I wouldn’t get that necessarily everywhere in the world.” It was a characteristically self-deprecating reference to the fact that even 4,000 miles from home, he was unable to escape Partygate. When this much-delayed trip was being planned, Johnson’s refreshed Downing Street team hoped it would demonstrate his commitment to the solid issues of investment, post-Brexit trade deals and green energy. But beleaguered prime ministers rarely find solace from their troubles in trips abroad, and Johnson was peppered with questions about the collapse of his authority back in Westminster. By Thursday afternoon, being interviewed in the baking Gujarat sun by a string of broadcasters, he was noticeably tetchy, at one point theatrically consulting his watch, and urging Sky’s Beth Rigby to stick to questions about the substance of the India visit. In truth the victories from the visit were relatively modest. Johnson hailed the prospects for a free trade agreement, which the Indian government is indeed keen to press ahead with. Modi’s imprimatur may help speed up the process, but talks have been under way since January, after a shift in Indian policy. It has already signed recent deals with the UAE and Australia. There are questions, too, about how much the UK may be willing to tie in visas with any deal. Johnson appeared to signal he would welcome more high-skilled Indian immigration as part of an agreement, reversing a longstanding UK stance. Government sources claimed he was only referring to the “inter-company transfers” that allow firms to bring in overseas staff. Johnson also highlighted cooperation on green technologies, including a memorandum of understanding on wind power, which is expected to see Indian and UK firms collaborating. There was also the customary announcement of new investment projects, though some of these were notably small, one creating just 15 jobs (though, Downing Street claimed, 11,000 in all). Aside from that, tangible outcomes from the two-day tour were hard to identify, raising the question of why India, and why now, apart from the hope of generating some upbeat headlines about a post-Brexit trade deal. Johnson repeatedly insisted the UK and India were fellow democracies ready to take on autocratic regimes (without mentioning China or Russia by name). Human rights watchdogs warn that while it was indeed democratically elected, Modi’s government has taken on increasingly autocratic characteristics – including repressive measures against journalists and activists. Johnson stood alone at his final press conference in Delhi, because Modi himself has not given one for years. At the same time, the trip was also fraught with tensions about deepening the UK’s cooperation with a country whose stance is radically different on the overriding foreign policy issue of the day: Ukraine. Downing Street had made clear in advance that Johnson had no illusions about influencing Modi, who recently entertained Moscow’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Delhi – though the pair did discuss the conflict at length. The contradictions inherent in the relationship were evident in a story published in the Times of India during the visit, and not denied by No 10, that the UK had requested a US-made Chinook helicopter be used to transport Johnson to a JCB factory visit, instead of a Russian-made alternative. India buys much of its defence equipment from Russia. One of the few solid announcements from the visit was that the UK will liberalise exports of defence equipment to India, issuing an across-the-board licence so that individual contracts will be subject to less scrutiny. That was intended as a signal of defence cooperation as part of Johnson’s “Indo-Pacific tilt” towards a region he described in his closing press conference as “the geopolitical centre of the world”. But it was thrown into question by a report from the defence thinktank Rusi on Friday warning that Russia is laundering components for weapons from western countries through India. While Johnson’s reception in India was certainly warm, he left his lieutenants back home exposed to the full force of backbench fury over Partygate, and returns with little to show for it. And the welcome as he flies back to London is unlikely to be anything but chilly.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson feels Westminster heat under the Indian sun,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/boris-johnson-india-modi-partygate
4/23/2022,"The orbital space around Earth must urgently be protected by environmental rules and regulations akin to those that safeguard the planet’s land, seas and air, leading scientists say. An international team of researchers warn that a dramatic rise in the number of satellites is polluting the night sky for astronomers and stargazers, while increasing the risk of objects colliding in space and potentially even striking people or aircraft when they fall back to Earth. Much of the concern is driven by the surge in mega-constellations, which involve placing tens of thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit to deliver broadband internet and other services. While companies such as SpaceX and OneWeb are leading the way, others are interested, including Rwanda, which recently filed an application to launch 327,000 satellites in a single project. Writing in Nature Astronomy, scientists from the UK, US, Canada and the Netherlands warn the number of satellites in low Earth orbit could exceed 100,000 by 2030, disrupting the work of astronomers and reshaping our view of the heavens as the number of satellites seen as “fake stars” starts to rival the number of real stars seen with the naked eye. “We really need to get our act together. We need to see where have we got regulations that we’re not applying properly, and where do we need new regulations?” said the lead author, Andy Lawrence, a regius professor of astronomy at the University of Edinburgh. “This is about recognising that the problems we see in orbit are the same as those we see when we worry about the land, the oceans and the atmosphere. We need to knock heads together and say how can we solve this problem.” Among the proposals are regulations based on a satellite’s space traffic footprint and limits on the carrying capacity of different orbits. In late 2018, about 2,000 active satellites circled Earth. That number has nearly doubled in the past two years with SpaceX launches alone. All have gone into the most congested low Earth orbit, which reaches from 100-2,000km above Earth. In 2019, the European Space Agency moved its orbiting Aeolus observatory to avoid colliding with a SpaceX satellite, the first time it had swerved around an active satellite. Last year, the Chinese moved their space station twice because of similar concerns. The scientists argue that while there is robust regulation to ensure satellites are launched safely and transmit signals only within certain frequency bands, there is almost nothing to govern the impact of satellites on the night sky, astronomy, Earth’s atmosphere or the orbital environment. The researchers describe how light reflecting off satellites can ruin astronomical observations by leaving streaks across images, while their broadcasts can drown out the faint, natural radio signals that astronomers study to understand some of the most exotic objects in the cosmos. But the visible presence of so many satellites also undermines the ability to enjoy the night sky, they argue, an act the International Astronomical Union asserts should be a fundamental right. There are other concerns too. The risk of falling satellite debris causing damage to property or harm to life today is relatively low. But the danger will notch upwards as more satellites re-enter Earth’s atmosphere at the end of their lives, with potentially lethal consequences. “The first aircraft strike or ground casualty is only a matter of time,” the researchers warn. Yet another issue is rocket launch emissions which include carbon dioxide, nitric oxide and soot. “The problem of increasing debris and congestion in Earth orbit poses a real challenge for the governance of human space activity,” said Chris Newman, a professor of space law and policy at the University of Northumbria. “The breadth of new actors and increased geopolitical tensions mean that a binding international treaty is a long way off. In any event, the law can only take us so far. Countries and companies that are active in space need to demonstrate responsible leadership.”",News/Science,"Orbital space around Earth must be protected amid rise in satellites, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/22/orbital-space-earth-protected-scientists-satellites

4/23/2022,"In the fourth and final episode of They Call Me Magic (Apple TV+), Earvin “Magic” Johnson – often considered the finest basketball player of all time – sits comfortably, smiles widely and assesses his own merits. “All the things I was on the basketball court, I am as a businessman. Disciplined. Focused. Building a strategy.” While these may well be the qualities needed to become a multimillionaire sporting hero, they are not the traits that make for a gripping sports documentary. They Call Me Magic is a story of obstacles overcome, but Johnson hurdles them all so easily that no drama develops. He grows up in an honest, blue-collar family in Lansing, Michigan, his mother working in a school cafeteria while his father does long shifts at a car plant. Honing his basketball skills in pickup games against grown men, Earvin Johnson Jr soon has scalpers trading tickets outside his high school matches, is given the nickname “Magic” and proceeds smoothly to college level, where he leads Michigan to the 1979 NCAA championship. The cloud of his unglamorous upbringing clears. Johnson skips the final year of college and turns pro, joining the Los Angeles Lakers and helping them reach the 1980 NBA finals. When star player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar gets injured and is absent for the crucial Game 6, the 20-year-old Johnson takes over, operating out of position at center instead of point guard and turning in one of the greatest single-game performances in NBA history. The Lakers win and go on to dominate the 1980s, with Johnson coming out on top in his rivalry with the Boston Celtics’ Larry Bird. Meanwhile, Magic enjoys the celebrity lifestyle, refusing for years to commit to childhood sweetheart, Cookie, although in interview this doesn’t seem to have caused Cookie Johnson – so we know how that story ends – any great distress. Magic is worth dutifully waiting for: he’s busy being the best. It’s not obvious as to how exactly Johnson ruled his sport since, although it has plenty of cracking archive footage of the media hoopla around the Lakers, the series features hardly any basketball action. Perhaps it’s afraid of alienating those with little knowledge of a game that, because it is high-scoring and based on gradually asserted supremacy rather than spectacular moments, is hard to sum up in clips. Combine basketball’s opacity with the blandly pleasant positivity of the interviewees, and you have a documentary where everything seems to just happen naturally. Johnson is a calm, pleasant presence throughout, often laughing heartily at the end of the most banal anecdotes, in the manner of someone who has never failed for long enough to sharpen a sense of humour. The way serious issues pose virtually no threat to him does, however, border on comical. The NBA at the dawn of the 1980s is a ratty spectacle blighted by violence, scant live TV coverage and racial tensions, but Johnson’s arrival seems to fix all this overnight. The shock of him being diagnosed as HIV positive in 1991 leads only to a brief period of introspection before he cheerfully embraces the challenge of destigmatising the condition. Even the Rodney King riots in LA serve mainly as inspiration for Johnson’s post-retirement entrepreneurialism, giving him the idea to open cinemas, gyms and Starbucks franchises in previously desolate inner cities. This goes so well that he ends up buying the LA Dodgers, who duly win baseball’s World Series. Which is nice. Any personal demons are soon straightened out, while Johnson’s enemies are charmed or easily vanquished, or both. The closest the Magic story has to an antagonist is probably Isaiah Thomas, the Detroit Pistons point guard who is Johnson’s practice buddy in the off season for years, until the Pistons face the Lakers in the 1988 NBA Finals. Johnson remorselessly smashes Thomas on the court, their friendship ends, and the Magic carnival moves frictionlessly on. You long for him to display the childish inadequacy of Paul Gascoigne, the cold supervillain vibes of Tom Brady or the addiction to conflict of Michael Jordan. Not that Jordan has any conflict with Johnson, despite helping to end his career by succeeding him as the NBA’s most dominant player: they hug after matches and then team up as the USA flatten all comers at the 1992 Olympics. The makers of They Call Me Magic can essentially get whoever they like to appear, such is Johnson’s pull, giving the show a rich, luxury feel. The Lakers superfan celebrating how the team lit up life in his tough LA neighbourhood? Snoop Dogg. The old guy who remembers how big a deal it was when the NCAA regional final saw his local team, Arkansas, take on Larry Bird’s Indiana side? Bill Clinton. Barack Obama pops up a couple of times to say nothing of note. Earvin “Magic” Johnson is the cream, the best, on a level above the A list – but when there’s such an overwhelming winner, there’s no sport.",Arts/Television & radio,"They Call Me Magic review – Earvin ‘Magic’ Johnson is calm, pleasant and lacking a sense of humor",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/they-call-me-magic-review-earvin-magic-johnson-is-calm-pleasant-and-lacking-a-sense-of-humor
4/23/2022,"If, once upon a time, the swimwear packed in your suitcase might have been an afterthought – a bikini designed to max out a tan and lunchtime dip – it is set to become the main event of your holiday wardrobe this summer. Statement swimwear is here. To be clear, this trend is not about the sort of swimsuits to do 40 lengths. In the same way that wider fashion has moved to a glamorous night-time look as we emerge from the pandemic, swimwear is the latest – perhaps more unlikely – category to have a moment of maximalism. Brands such as Léa the Label, Maygel Coronel, Norma Kamali and Johanna Ortiz are leading a charge for costumes with ruffles, unusual cut-outs and metallic fabrics. These are designs that would get you cross looks in any pool’s fast lane. They are meant to stay dry for the Insta shoot. The swimwear market is growing. It was valued at more than $16bn in 2020, with Euromonitor predicting it would reach $21.4bn (£16.6bn) by 2025. Swimwear strictly for poolside lounging, and worn with heels rather than flip-flops, has been around for a few years. It features heavily at the villa in ITV’s Love Island (back this June), where contestants rarely get into the pool but spend most of the day in bikinis, and on the Instagram feed of stars including Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Megan Thee Stallion and Emily Ratajkowski. Ruffled and complicated swimwear can also now be found on the high street, with Zara offering suits with oversized flowers that may threaten to slow down the wearer’s front crawl. Kelsey Lyle, the swimwear buyer for US luxury site Moda Operandi, says: “Our customer loves both minimal and more embellished, detailed swimwear.” Lyle names Johanna Ortiz as “the designer to kick off the ready-to-wear meets swim trend … At Moda, we like to call this look ‘barefoot glamour.’” Marks & Spencer, perhaps more traditionally known for its sensible swimming costumes, has noticed a trend towards poolside dressing up. The brand has launched a “one stop holiday shop” in response. “We’ve never been more coordinated,” says Lisa Illis, the head of womenswear design. “[There are] printed bucket hats, bags and sandals that coordinate back to our beach swim collections. [It’s] an Instagram-worthy head-to-toe look.” Thankfully, this is swimwear you can actually swim in, made with chlorine-resistant elastane. Perhaps the most curious development here is bridal swimwear – with Pamela Anderson marrying Tommy Lee on the beach in a white bikini in 1995 as the style reference, as reprised by Lily James in the recent Disney+ series Pam & Tommy. According to Women’s Wear Daily, more than 2.5m weddings are expected to take place in the US in 2022 – the most since 1984. Matchesfashion.com launched its wedding and events edit in January 2020. The head of womenswear, Liana Wiggins, says the UK-based retailer has, like Moda Operandi, seen an uplift in sales of swimwear. “A lot of our customers are planning for destination weddings,” she says. “Maygel Coronel’s ruffled one-shoulder swimsuits are statement styles that still feel romantic and the intricate details of Isa Boulder’s woven bikini feel really special – both are perfect for a beach wedding styled with a sarong or long flowing skirt.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Ruffles, cut-outs and metallic fabrics: statement swimwear is here",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/22/ruffles-cut-outs-and-metallic-fabrics-statement-swimwear-is-here

4/23/2022,"Christian Williams has enjoyed a memorable season in valuable staying handicap chases and holds a very strong hand as the campaign draws to a close in the Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown on Saturday. Kitty’s Light, desperately unlucky when placed third in this race 12 months ago, is joined in the line-up by stable companion Win My Wings, the easy winner of the Scottish Grand National earlier this month when Kitty’s Light finished seven lengths away in second. Cap Du Nord, a comfortable winner for the stable at Kempton in February, is also in the field, but the Ayr 1-2 look like Williams’s prime contenders. Kitty’s Light is, in theory, weighted to reverse the form on 12lb better terms, but fast-improving Win My Wings (3.32) had plenty left in the tank last time and, with Rob James claiming a very useful 7lb, she is worth a bet at around 5-1 to become the first horse since 2007 to complete the Ayr-Sandown double. Sandown: 1.50 There was plenty of market confidence behind Whizz Kid before his handicap debut at the Grand National meeting, when his inexperience showed in some hit-and-miss hurdling. He did well to finish less than three lengths behind the winner in the circumstances and with Sam Twiston-Davies replacing a conditional in the saddle, a more polished round of jumping would make him the one to beat. Haydock: 2.05 Alrehb has yet to race on turf but he has a big chance at the weights on his all-weather form and the excellent Laura Pearson takes off a handy 3lb. Sandown: 2.25 Erne River was second-favourite for a Grade One novice at Aintree last time and was slightly hampered when falling at the 10th fence. He had done nothing wrong in two previous chase starts, recording a decent winning time in both, and though he has a few pounds to find with his three rivals on ratings, he has much more scope for improvement. The early betting, which rates him the 5-1 outsider of the field, looks wrong. Leicester 2.45: Happy Power is the second-favourite in a disappointing three-runner field but he has 1lb in hand of Path Of Thunder, the market leader, on ratings and showed his best recent turf form when making the running at Goodwood last summer. He could be tough to pass if David Probert gets a soft lead. Haydock: 1.00 Corsini, 1.30 After John, 2.05 Alrehb, 2.40 Irresistable, 3.15 Aussie Banker, 3.45 Darkness, 4.20 Mille Miglia. Leicester: 1.35 Sunny Orange, 2.10 Achnamara, 2.45 Happy Power, 3.20 Letmelivemylife, 3.51 Magisterial, 4.26 Flower Of Thunder, 4.56 Mumayaz. Ripon: 1.45 Insolente, 2.20 Imperial Command, 2.55 Haizoom, 3.28 Noman, 4.00 Ava Go Joe, 4.35 Mandobi, 5.10 Buckshaw Village. Sandown: 1.50 Whizz Kid (nb), 2.25 Erne River, 3.00 Greaneteen, 3.32 Win My Wings (nap), 4.07 Scaramanga, 4.40 Flic Ou Voyou, 5.15 Glynn. Doncaster: 5.05 Definitive Force, 5.35 Hezahunk, 6.05 Spirit Of The Bay, 6.35 Edgar Linton, 7.05 Matchless, 7.35 In The Breeze, 8.05 Wholeofthemoon. Wolverhampton: 5.45 Global Vision, 6.20 Desert Team, 6.50 Pilot Wings, 7.20 Scarborough Castle, 7.50 Goolwa, 8.20 Warm Smile, 8.50 Prydwen.  Sandown: 3.00 Nube Negra was 12 lengths behind Greaneteen in the Tingle Creek but is still the narrow favourite here with most bookies. That is surely a result of Greaneteen’s poor run at Leopardstown in February, but he should be fresher for a two-month break and is returning to a track that plays to his strengths.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Win My Wings can soar to rare double at Sandown,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/talking-horses-win-my-wings-can-soar-to-rare-double-at-sandown
