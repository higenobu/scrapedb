Last night, the Senate approved a massive spending bill that allocates $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine.

3/13/2022,"Former Vice President Mike Pence has spent the past week outmaneuvering Donald Trump, his old boss and potential 2024 primary opponent. Shortly after the plane Trump was flying on last weekend was forced to land due to an engine failure, Pence flew to Israel on the private jet of the GOP’s most prized donor, Miriam Adelson. And while Trump was avoiding criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin in a call-in interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Pence and his wife, Karen, flew to the border between Ukraine and Poland to distribute relief aid to refugees. In perhaps the most telling indication that the political dynamic between the two men has shifted, Pence implicitly hit Trump at a Republican National Committee speech last Friday, saying the GOP should not include any “apologists for Putin.” “Welcome to the front end of the Pence boomlet,” said veteran Republican pollster Michael Cohen, who has no relation to the former Trump lawyer. “Who had a better week or past few weeks than Pence? I mean, it’s not even close.” When Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, he not only resolidified the old Western alliances formed in the wake of World War II, he also shook up the Republican Party’s power dynamics, at least temporarily. The longtime center of power on the right, Trump has been struggling to garner attention for himself after six years of almost unilaterally controlling the national stage. And Pence, who’s best known for being stiff, boring and deferential to the former president, has walked into the center of the vacuum created by Trump's absence. Pence has even grabbed prime slots on Fox News, making news in an interview with one of Trump’s favorite hosts, Maria Bartiromo. Bartiromo pressed Pence repeatedly on his plans for 2024, and whether he would run against Trump if the former president enters the race. But Pence played coy, brushing away the questions. “I’m confident the Republican Party will nominate a candidate who will be the next president of the United States of America, and at the right time, my family and I will reflect and consider how we might participate in that process,” Pence said. The burst of attention for Pence comes after more than a year of laying groundwork behind the scenes, making campaign-style trips to early-voting states like New Hampshire and Iowa and courting Republican donors who have bankrolled successful White House bids. Trump remains the leader in early polls for the 2024 party nomination, but despite his popularity with the Republican grassroots, a number of GOP lawmakers are mulling runs of their own. All are trying to develop their own unique brands, whether through Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s culture-war broadsides or Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton’s appeal to unite the pre- and post-Trump wings of the GOP. Yet despite his very public falling out with Trump, Pence's backers see him as a figure uniquely suited to bring together the warring factions within the GOP. An evangelical Christian originally elected to Congress in 2000, he steadily climbed the ranks of the House Republican caucus. In 2012, Indiana voters elected him governor, a position he left to become Trump’s running mate and shore up the erstwhile TV host’s conservative bona fides. Since the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, in which Trump-backed rioters threatened to hang Pence for not helping the then president overturn the 2020 election results, Pence has been slowly and steadily hitting the campaign trail — even though he has yet to announce his intentions for 2024. A Pence spokesman did not respond to Yahoo News’ request for comment. But the real break in the dam seemed to come almost immediately after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. Trump and his backers, who just days earlier had been touting Putin’s “genius,” suddenly looked outdated and perhaps out of touch with the GOP. “The McCain wing of the GOP is back and stronger than ever, truth-telling about Mr. KGB,” said longtime Republican strategist Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole’s campaign for president in 1996. But Republican operatives, like the candidates they advise, are still trying to game out whether the turn from Trump-style populism, at least in matters of foreign policy, is permanent or merely a passing fluke. “It’s too soon to tell, but I still think Americans don’t want U.S. troops over there, and a lot don’t want to even send money there,” said former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “This could be an issue in the midterms.” Pence, meanwhile, is doing what he has always done, plodding forward steadily and waiting for his moments to grab the spotlight.",Politics/Yahoo News,Mike Pence knocks Trump and lays the groundwork for possible presidential run,https://news.yahoo.com/mike-pence-knocks-trump-and-lays-the-groundwork-for-possible-presidential-run-212200455.html
3/13/2022,"The shock to commodities from Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine will speed up global efforts to abandon fossil fuels, and cement Canada's role as a stable source of oil and gas in what's expected to be a decades-long energy transition. That's the view from Horizons ETFs Management Canada, one of the country's top exchange-traded fund providers with nearly $22 billion in assets under management. From global oil benchmarks to metals used in electric vehicle batteries, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions from Western powers have caused massive price increases across the commodities complex. As a result, Horizons says it's seen an uptick in interest in both its oil and gas funds, as well as those tracking uranium, lithium and hydrogen. ""What these high natural gas and oil prices in Europe are really demonstrating is that Europe can't be dependent on Russia for its energy needs,"" Nicolas Piquard, vice-president, portfolio manager and options strategist with Horizons, said in an interview. ""What this will do is really accelerate the move into renewables."" Toronto-based Horizons manages 105 ETFs on major Canadian stock exchanges. Piquard says the firm had only a small direct exposure to Russia through its emerging markets and currency ETFs prior to the country's assault on Ukraine. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and European Brent crude futures (BZ=F) saw slight declines on Thursday, following a meteoric rise in response to U.S. and European sanctions on Russian oil announced on Tuesday. While surging oil prices have added to the already strong performance of oil and gas equities this year, expectations that European nations will prioritize cleaner sources of energy to replace imported Russian fossil fuels have lifted clean energy stocks from a recent slump. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), a US$5.6 billion basket of clean energy stocks, has climbed more than 13 per cent since Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. Horizons' hydrogen and uranium-focused ETFs have climbed more than 20 per cent in that time. ""Maybe high oil prices are exactly what we need,"" Piquard said. ""It will make all sorts of energies more economic, like solar, wind, and nuclear."" Ryan Bushell, president and portfolio manager at Newhaven Asset Management, says renewable energy shares took on a temporary state of euphoria on the heels of U.S. President Joe Biden's 2020 election win. At the same time, he notes major institutional investors and massive pension funds were publicly touting ESG-friendly investments, divesting from oil and gas. ""There were a whole bunch of factors that pushed that agenda for a while,"" he said. ""Now, the fast money has gone from playing renewable power to good old fashioned oil and gas."" Like Piquard, Bushell says the run in commodity prices makes green energy more attractive because the economics are now more competitive. ""You're seeing the stocks really start to move,"" said Bushell, who owns shares of clean energy producers Northland Power (NPI.TO), Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN.TO) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP-UN.TO)(BEP) for clients, as well as a host of fossil fuel stocks. It places Canada in a very, very enviable position. I believe we will find ways to get that oil to markets that won’t buy from places like Russia.Nicolas Piquard, vice-president, portfolio manager and options strategist with Horizons Horizons ETFs Management Canada The prospect of Russian oil being ostracized by a growing number of importing nations raises questions about Canada's role in shoring up global supply. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer, with output of more than five million barrels per day, and the biggest foreign supplier of crude to the U.S. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney recently urged the United States to revive the Keystone XL pipeline project, which President Biden effectively killed on his first day in office due to environmental concerns. TC Energy (TRP.TO)(TRP), the pipeline's owner, has said the project will not move forward. Mark Little, chief executive officer of Canadian energy giant Suncor (SU.TO)(SU), said in an interview with CBC News earlier this week that Canada's oilpatch has the capacity to move additional crude into the U.S. However, Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has downplayed Canada's ability to quickly ramp up exports. Canada has limited pipeline capacity running south, and only one export pipeline to its coast, the Trans Mountain line in British Columbia. Piquard says he's ""frustrated"" by the Biden administration's willingness to engage in talks with Venezuela to potentially ease U.S. sanctions and increase oil imports from the dictator-led country, rather than reach out to Canada. With the global transition from fossil fuels still in the early innings of what experts suggest could be a decades-long shift, he's confident that Canadian oil and gas will see rising demand from beyond North America in the future. ""Canada is one of the few countries that's a true democracy, and aligned with the Western world, that has high oil and gas reserves, and an ability to increase production,"" Piquard said. ""It places Canada in a very, very enviable position. I believe we will find ways to get that oil to markets that won't buy from places like Russia.""
