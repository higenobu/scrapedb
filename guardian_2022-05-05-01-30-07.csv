5/5/2022,"PricewaterhouseCoopers has told its accountants and other staff they can finish work early on Fridays over the summer, becoming the latest company to offer flexible work incentives to try to keep employees happy and compete for talent. The accountancy firm has written to its 22,000 UK staff and told them they can knock off at lunchtime on Fridays between 1 June and 31 August, assuming they get their work done. It expects the majority of employees to benefit from this. The move comes after PwC ran a pilot of “summer working hours” in July and August last year, which proved so popular that the policy has been extended by another month this summer. A poll of 6,000 staff showed three-quarters of them felt that the shortened hours “impacted their general wellbeing to a great extent”. More than 90% thought the policy was a good idea, and three-quarters said spending more time with family and friends was the greatest benefit. Kevin Ellis, PwC UK’s chairman, said: “We knew summer working hours would be popular with our people, but the positive impact on wellbeing surpassed expectations. Not everyone could take every Friday, but they benefited from less email traffic when they did and a chance to switch off properly. “We’ve had another exceptionally busy year and as we approach the summer holiday period, we hope our policy gives people more time for themselves, their friends and their families.” Summer working hours are part of “The Deal”, PwC’s approach to hybrid working introduced last spring. It means staff can work from home some of the time and decide their own hours, but are expected to spend two to three days a week in the office or at client sites. In October, the firm introduced flexible bank holidays, allowing people to take up to two bank holidays when it suits them. The company, one of the big four accountancy firms, is competing for talent with its three rivals. Deloitte said in June it would let its 20,000 UK employees decide “when, where and how they work” after the success of remote working during the Covid crisis. In the City, the UK stockbroker FinnCap has pledged to give its employees unlimited holiday to prevent staff burnout, while last spring the global investment bank Citigroup’s new chief executive, Jane Fraser, introduced “Zoom-free Fridays” and an additional holiday. PwC posted a 2% rise in UK revenues to £4.4bn in the year to the end of June, while group profit climbed 25% to £1.2bn. Profit per partner rose by 27% to £868,000.",Lifestyle/Money,PwC offers UK staff shorter Friday work hours for summer,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/04/pwc-offers-staff-shorter-friday-work-hours-for-summer
5/5/2022,"Their colour is an unmissable shade of fuchsia pink. They walk the streets across the Philippines, posting banners along the way and stopping anyone who will listen. Many are young or first-time voters, and some travel for hours to join campaign teams. For them, next week’s election is a make-or-break moment for their country. “I really want change,” says Mariel Ramirez, 35, a first-time voter who is among those campaigning. The impact of the pandemic on the poorest, and the prospect of the return to office of one of the country’s most controversial families – the Marcoses – drove her to act. “It’s so obvious that a [Marcos] presidency would really just bring the country to its lowest point,” said Ramirez. “They’re a family who just enrich themselves.” There are just days left until more than 67 million Filipinos vote for their next president in a highly contentious election. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, known as “Bongbong” and the son of the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, is leading in opinion polls – despite his late father’s notorious history of corruption and rights abuses. Leni Robredo and her army of nearly 2 million volunteers, known as Kakampinks (pink allies), are trying to stop Macros Jr. Robredo, a human rights lawyer who has advocated for disadvantaged groups and is the current vice-president, is trailing second in the polls by a significant margin. In an election where online misinformation is rife, her supporters have launched a door-to-door effort that is unusual in its scale. In Sampaloc, a deprived district of Manila, some residents are receptive. Josie Loyola, 70, who sits outside her house in the morning sunshine, smiles as she spots the campaigners passing by. “She is good hearted, she has a lot of accomplishments,” Loyola says of Robredo. But she lowers her voice when she speaks of Marcos Jr: “[He] is really questionable, he has questionable integrity.” She worries about political instability, or a repeat of martial law, which was imposed by Marcos Sr in 1972. Human rights violations were rife during the nine-year period: 3,240 people were killed, while tens of thousands more were tortured and imprisoned, according to Amnesty International. Loyola’s son, who is crouched beside a tub of soapy water, stays focused on scrubbing his motorbike. He is undecided, he says. Not everyone wants to talk. A few doors down, images of a smiling Marcos Jr, holding his hand in a peace sign, are plastered on to a house. It was 36 years ago that the People Power revolution brought an end to Marcoses’ 20-year rule, forcing the family to flee into exile. They fled by helicopter, stashing onboard items totalling $15m (£12m): including gold bars, freshly printed cash and hundreds of pieces of jewellery. It was small change compared with the overall estimates of the family’s ill-gotten wealth. Some suggest as much as $10bn was plundered by the family. Marcos Sr died in1989, but the rest of the family was allowed to return to the Philippines in the 1990s and it has been slowly rebranding itself ever since. “Our democratic transition did not go through a process of transitional justice – unlike other countries that went through political or civil strife,” says Julio Teehankee, professor of political science and international studies at De La Salle University in Manila. Instead, the Marcoses was given a warm reception by the powerful, says Teehankee. “The society elites, the circles, embraced them and treated them as celebrities.” The family began to re-establish their position in politics and cement allegiances. In 2016, Marcos Sr was given a hero’s burial with military honours on the recommendation of President Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos survivors were appalled and warned history was being whitewashed. Duterte’s daughter Sara is Marcos Jr’s running mate. Observers say the failure of the Philippine education system to properly discuss the reality of the Marcos rule has created a gap in public knowledge, especially among younger generations, which the Marcos Jr’s camp has exploited. Online, social media accounts linked to or supportive of the Marcoses down play the dictatorship, seek to justify or even deny past abuses by spreading misinformation. They present the Marcos years as a golden era: a time when the economy was thriving; when infrastructure was developed; and there was peace and order. The human rights abuses and kleptocracy are swept aside. Celica Inductivo, 35, who lives across from Loyola, stands over a simmering pot, preparing lunch for her family, as volunteers pass. She will vote for Marcos Jr, she says. During martial law, if were a decent citizen, you did not have anything to be afraid of, her mother, who was a volunteer for Marcos Sr, told her. Inductivo does not believe his son is corrupt, and admires him for rising above such comments. “Despite the various criticisms against BBM, like [the claim he is a] thief, he doesn’t fight back,” she says, using the now popular abbreviation for Bongbong Marcos. He has been criticised for failing to attend presidential debates, and for dodging awkward media questions, including over his failure to pay a tax bill that, according to local reports, could amount to more than $3.9bn. Marcos Jr, whose slogan is “together we shall rise again”, has stuck to a simple campaign message of unity and rekindling a former greatness. “That’s one of the greatest ironies in this year’s election. The most divisive and polarising political brand in the country’s history has appropriated the message of unity and hope,” says Teehankee. It is perhaps a message that is easier to sell. “Authoritarian nostalgia is very simplistic. If you are quite frustrated and desperate, then it’s easy to believe in this rather than Robredo campaign discourse of Filipinos owning the problems of the country, and helping her find solutions for it,” adds Jean Encinas Franco, an associate professor of political science at the University of the Philippines. Polling released by Pulse Asia suggests 56% of voters would pick Marcos Jr as president, who remains the most popular candidate among all age groups. Yet Franco believes Robredo’s campaign, and the large army of supporters it has attracted, will have a lasting impact on Philippine politics regardless of the election outcome. She points not only to Robredo’s impassioned volunteers, but also to impressive turnouts of voters at her rallies. The atmosphere at such gatherings is festive, youthful and hopeful, Franco adds. “I have never seen these kind of rallies or this kind of support for any kind of politician since I started voting,” she says. “There is now a critical mass of people. Whoever the president will be, he or she will have to contend with this portion of Filipinos who are actively engaged.”For Ramirez, who has taken part in two house-to-house campaigns, and attended three rallies, she believes every possible vote counts. The election could, she says, either steer the Philippines forward, or “pull us further backwards and plunge the country down to a state of hopelessness and massive corruption”. Whatever happens next week, she says she will no longer be silent about politics. “We have so much to lose this time around.”",News/World news,‘Authoritarian nostalgia’: Philippines seems set to return Marcoses to power ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/authoritarian-nostalgia-philippines-seem-set-return-marcoses-to-power-ferdinand-marcos-jr
5/5/2022,"While the battle over abortion rights rages in the US the issue of access to abortion services is yet to be fully resolved in part of the UK. Two years after abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland girls and women in the region struggle to access services that are patchy to nonexistent. Despite progressive legislation, in practice they still face having to continue a pregnancy against their wishes or travelling to England for abortions or taking unregulated abortion pills, Alyson Kilpatrick, chief commissioner of Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, said on Wednesday. “In Northern Ireland women and girls are still faced with deplorable options,” she said. Abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019, bringing it into line with the rest of the UK, after a Westminster vote led by the Labour MP Stella Creasy. Activists hailed it as a new era. However the region’s power-sharing executive at Stormont failed to fully commission services. A deadline to do so by the end of March this year came and went. “Despite securing decriminalisation and the overturning of our near-total abortion ban, we are still waiting for commissioned services to be established and for this healthcare to be accessible to all who need it,” said Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International’s campaigns manager for Northern Ireland. “We have a postcode lottery for access to abortion provision and the services that are in place remain in a fragile state.” Most people in Northern Ireland supported decriminalisation, according to surveys but political parties have moved cautiously, fearing they could alienate socially conservative supporters. Robin Swann, the Ulster Unionist health minister, declined to commission services, saying such a step required consensus in the five-party power-sharing executive, and the Democratic Unionist party was opposed. On paper, Northern Ireland permits abortion in many circumstances up to 24 weeks – which is more permissive than in other parts of the UK. In some areas abortion pills are available for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. The region has had more than 2,550 abortions since March 2020, according to the Department of Health. But women in western areas cannot access the pills via the region’s health trust. And women who are more than 10 weeks pregnant still need to travel to England for abortions. The lack of access disproportionately affects rural and working class women, said Connie Egan, an Alliance party candidate for North Down in Thursday’s assembly election, speaking in a personal capacity. “Abortions must be accessible and compliant with international human rights standards. The secretary of state must step in and commission full services.” The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, had set the March deadline for Stormont to commission services. If breached, he promised to take legal steps to override the executive and directly instruct the nation’s health trusts to provide abortion services. “We urge him to act without delay – we cannot wait any longer,” said Teggart. “All remaining barriers to abortion must be removed – a failure to do this without the required urgency would be an act of neglect.” Maeve O’Brien, a doctor and activist with Alliance for Choice in Derry, said the UK government should have intervened months ago when it was obvious the Stormont executive had no intention of commissioning services. “We see this uproar in the States but we’re here on Westminster’s doorstep and are being overlooked. We are dealing with desperate women.” Abortion pills could be bought online for £70 but for people in one of the poorest and most deprived regions in the UK that was prohibitive, said O’Brien. She contrasted the furore over Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that guaranteed the right to abortion in the US, with Northern Ireland. “It’s really jarring having this uproar at the same time as the absolute abandonment of these women.”",News/World news,Abortion services in Northern Ireland almost nonexistent despite legalisation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/abortion-services-in-northern-ireland-almost-nonexistent-despite-legalisation
5/5/2022,"From buying supermarket value brands to putting on a jumper in cold weather, people with wealth and power have been enthusiastically advising the public on how to cope with the cost of living crisis. Many seem unaware that Britain’s poorest families have no margin to absorb higher costs, and that genuine need has given them first-hand experience of how to make their budgets go further. Recent analysis by the Resolution Foundation showed that household spending has risen most for those on the lowest incomes, which the thinktank said highlighted the need for proper targeted support rather than money-saving tips. Here are some of the most ignorant suggestions that have provoked ire: On Wednesday, George Eustice, the minister overseeing food and farming, suggested that people should buy value ranges in the supermarket, which he patronisingly advised could enable them to “actually contain and manage their household budget”. Labour said it showed how “woefully out of touch” the government was, while commenters on social media were quick to point out that “how wealthy people and poor people save money is very, very different”. With gas and electricity increasing by up to 54% from April, energy companies have been offering their customers unwelcome advice on how to manage their bills. E.ON Next sent branded socks to customers to keep them warm – and subsequently had to apologise. Britain’s third biggest energy supplier, SSE, advised customers to keep their heating bills low by “having a cuddle with your pets”, eating “hearty bowls of porridge”, “doing a few star jumps” and drinking water instead of alcohol, comments it later admitted had “embarrassed” the company. When Boris Johnson was asked on Good Morning Britain what he thought about a 77-year-old woman who has only one meal a day and travels on buses during the day to keep her household bills down, the prime minister replied: “The 24-hour freedom bus pass [allowing free bus travel for over-60s in London] was actually something that I actually introduced.” Observers have pointed out that it was the London boroughs that brought the pass in, while the pensioner, Elsie, said she was “disappointed” with his response. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, who is paid more than £500,000, suggested that workers shouldn’t ask their employers for pay rises to contain the inflationary pressures confronting the British economy in 2022. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, told LBC that the government’s solution to the cost of living crisis was to “make sure there’s a job available” for people. This prompted the host, Tom Swarbrick, to ask whether “Molly-Mae has taken over the Conservative party”, in reference to the wealthy influencer who suggested that, regardless of socioeconomic background, “if you want something enough you can achieve it and it just depends to what lengths you want to go to”. With many struggling to afford monthly rents that have reached record highs, let alone average house prices that are 6.7 times average earnings, Kirstie Allsopp was derided on social media for suggesting that young people could buy their own homes if they gave up Netflix, easyJet flights, the gym and coffees. With the average deposit for a first-time buyer £59,000, according to Halifax, buyers would have to forgo their subscriptions, trips and coffees for 37 years. The wealthy chief executive of the energy supplier Utilita, Bill Bullen, suggested that people should use less electricity to deal with the cost of living crisis, after last winter drawing on his decades of industry expertise to recommend that people wear a jumper to keep heating bills down.",News/Business,"Quit Netflix, wear a jumper: Britons face barrage of patronising tips on cutting costs",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/quit-netflix-wear-a-jumper-britons-face-barrage-of-patronising-tips-on-cutting-costs
5/5/2022,"The Bosnian footballer and manager Ivica Osim, who has died aged 80, was perhaps most famous for resigning in bitterness as coach of Yugoslavia on the eve of the European Championship finals in 1992, protesting at the Serbian bombardment of his native city, Sarajevo. Declaring that “my country doesn’t deserve to play in the European Championship”, he walked out, never to return. Osim did not at any point regret the decision, and said at the time that “on the scale of human suffering, I cannot reconcile events at home with my position as national manager”. In any case, Yugoslavia were soon expelled from the finals due to their war-torn status, and their place was taken at the last moment by Denmark, who went on to win the tournament. Subsequently Osim travelled the world as a manager, having particular success in Austria, where he won two league titles with Sturm Graz, and in Japan, where he eventually took charge of the national team. Born Ivan, but universally known as Ivica, in Sarajevo, he was the son of Mihail, a railway mechanic, and his wife, Karolina. He began his playing career with his local team, the successful railway club Zeljeznicar, in 1959. He was a tall, elegant and elusive midfielder who was a ruthless dribbler. Within five years of his debut he was showing impressive form for Yugoslavia at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo and catching the eye of clubs in other countries. Yugoslav Federation rules prohibited players from going abroad until their late 20s, so it was not until 1968 that Osim was able to join the Dutch club Zwolsche Boys. There he played only two league games after sustaining a bad knee injury, and he returned to Zeljeznicar the following season before joining Strasbourg in the French league in 1970. After two years with Strasbourg he signed for Sedan, also in the French league, and played 105 league matches from 1972-5 before a move to Valenciennes. He then switched back to Strasbourg for a final couple of years from 1976-78. For Yugoslavia Osim won 16 caps between 1964 and 1969, and he was in the team that beat the then world champions, England, 1-0 in the semi-finals of the 1968 European Championship in Italy. However, he was injured in that match by a ruthless challenge from Norman Hunter and had to sit on the substitutes’ bench for the final against Italy, which was drawn 1-1, and again in the replay, in which Italy triumphed 2-0. As soon as he retired from playing with Strasbourg, Osim became coach of Zeljeznicar and in due course took them to the Yugoslav championship in 1971-72 and to a semi-final of the Uefa Cup in 1984-85, which they lost 4-3 over two legs to the Hungarian side Videoton. With the national team he had become assistant coach to Ivan Toplak in conjunction with managing Zeljeznicar, and in 1984 he helped Yugoslavia win bronze at the Olympics. In 1986 he left Zeljeznicar to take over from Toplak, and under his command Yugoslavia reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Italy in 1990, losing on penalties to Argentina. In 1991 he combined his Yugoslavia role with managing Partizan Belgrade, with whom he won the Yugoslav cup in 1992. He guided Yugoslavia into the 1992 European Championship finals, but then resigned in high dudgeon in May 1992 as his family in Sarajevo faced Serbian bombardment in the Bosnian war. After resigning from the managership of Yugoslavia, soon to disappear as a unified entity, Osim made his way later that year to Greece, where he became manager of the leading Athenian club, Panathinaikos, for two years, twice winning the Greek cup. In 1994 he was on the move again, this time to Austria, taking charge for eight years at Sturm Graz, with whom he twice won the Austrian championship, in 1998 and 1999. He then went to Japan, where, between 2003 and 2006, he managed the JEF United Chiba club, not one of the richer teams but quite successful under Osim despite its modest means. On the back of his achievements there, in 2006 he was appointed manager of the Japanese national team, where he developed a reputation for subjecting his players to angry tirades, occasionally reducing even his interpreter to tears. For all his acerbic outbursts he was hugely popular in Japan, and when a book of his apothegms, Words of Osim, was published, it sold 400,000 copies. In November 2007, while watching a league game, Osim collapsed with a stroke. Not until 10 days later did he regain consciousness in the Juntendo University hospital in Urayasu, asking his wife, Asima, “What was the result?” Too ill to continue in management, he relinquished his role with Japan the following month. Osim is survived by Asima and their three children, Selmir, Amar and Irma.

5/5/2022,"Jesse Lingard has resolved to leave Manchester United when his contract expires this summer even if Erik ten Hag tries to persuade him to stay. Lingard feels he has not been shown the respect he deserves this season after more than 20 years at United and sources close to the player say his mind is made up irrespective of any overtures from the incoming manager. The 29-year-old was an unused substitute against Brentford on Monday in United’s final home game when Juan Mata, whose deal also ends in June, was given a first Premier League start of the season and Edinson Cavani, who has decided to leave, came off the bench. Lingard thought he had received a promise last summer from Ole Gunnar Solskjær that he would get more first-team chances after ending the previous season with an impressive loan at West Ham. But he barely featured under the Norwegian despite the team’s underwhelming form and has been more out of the team than in under Ralf Rangnick, the interim manager. Lingard was dismayed in January when a proposed loan to Newcastle broke down because of the terms demanded by his boyhood club. There was also interest then from Tottenham and Newcastle and it is understood Lingard would consider a move abroad as he tries to reignite his career and force his way back into the England squad before the World Cup. Lingard’s brother Louie described United as “classless” on Instagram after the Brentford match and wrote of his sibling: “Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send-off!!!

5/5/2022,"Ihave started getting feelings for my spoons. I blame Tim Hayward, restaurant critic for the Financial Times, for this. He wrote a brilliant piece last week about his search for the perfect spoon. At first glance this was a bit random, even for me. But before long I was with him all the way in his quest for the spoon of his dreams, a spoon of just the right depth, size, shape, length and other variables. I surveyed my spoon drawer and considered my feelings. I was disappointed to see I have no fewer than 17 wooden spoons. Disappointed because this implies a certain shallowness, as if I’m some kind of spoon lothario, collecting notches on my bedpost, focusing on quantity rather than quality. Stirring without love is just exercise, after all. But sorting through them, I realised I do have a favourite. It’s more of a spatula than a spoon, but it suits me very well. I had always looked out for it without knowing I was doing so and felt a twinge of disappointment if it didn’t come to hand. If ever I lost it for good, I now understood, I would miss it for ever. Could it just be me and the FT’s Tim who feel this way? My editor at BBC Radio 5 live did a good job of disguising her enthusiasm when I suggested a phone-in on the subject of our listeners’ favourite spoons. But she went with it, God bless her. I get significant stick for ruminating on ball-achingly mundane subjects like this and, I’ll be honest, on this occasion my confidence did start to waver. I needed back up, so FT Tim was booked to come on air with me. Just like great news organisations sometimes come together, pooling resources to pull off groundbreaking investigative journalism, here I assembled a mighty trinity of the BBC, the FT and the Guardian. All so I wouldn’t be left to shoulder the blame alone if the listeners balked at this madness. It didn’t start well. The first text in read: “Adrian, you’ve lost it luv, Carol”. Jonathan Agnew, our venerable cricket correspondent, came on to talk about the appointment of Ben Stokes as England captain, but began by asking me: “What’s all this about spoons? I think you need a lie down in a darkened room.” I asked him if he had a favourite spoon. “No,” he said. But it wasn’t long before I knew we were on to a winner. “My husband, Richard, aged 81, has a very favourite spoon,” texted Sue. “Routs about in the cutlery drawer to find it. He acquired it when he worked at the GEC at Witton in Birmingham and went to the Magnet Club works canteen every day for his lunch. So it dates back to around 1960. It has Magnet Club engraved on the handle. Memories are made of items like this.” Peter in Wimbledon, recently divorced, said it was the cutlery he missed most from his marriage. Someone else said they always used their least favourite spoon because it was a gift from their son. Oh yes, this was a rich vein of material we were mining. It all became rather moving. Ross from Streatley had framed a wooden spoon belonging to his nan. “It was her gravy spoon, half worn down over 50 years of use,” he texted. “It brings back so many memories.” Ian said: “I have two dessert spoons that my father had before me that I use every day. I lost my father 35 years ago this week.” A spoon as memento mori. Who knew? Karen in Edinburgh phoned in to tell us she was experiencing what she called spoon grief. A daft notion you may think, but it immediately made perfect sense. Her late mother’s serving spoon was missing, presumed lost. “Every time I go in that drawer, I feel so sad,” she said. “There was so much love in that spoon.”",Opinion/Opinion,I’ve no fewer than 17 wooden spoons.

5/5/2022,"Sicily’s famed cascading limestone cliff may not be the obvious choice for the next takeover bid by the world’s richest man, but one Italian man is hoping for such an eventuality. Part of the island’s Turkish Steps is being readied for sale, with a call to Elon Musk to buy it. Ferdinando Sciabarrà, 72, who was last year officially declared owner of a slice of the cliff’s upper level after a long legal tussle with the local authority in Realmonte, Agrigento, and after years of complaints about the landmark’s upkeep, believes the multibillionaire would know how to look after it much better. The Scala dei Turchi, or Turkish Steps, is one of Italy’s most visited tourist sites and features prominently in the Inspector Montalbano books by the late author Andrea Camilleri. Sciabarrà, who formerly worked for the local chamber of commerce, staked his claim of ownership based on inheritance documents dating back to the 19th century. He was handed back his share of the cliff after being investigated for occupation of state-owned land. He said he was now putting it up for auction after requests to local and regional authorities to introduce measures to better protect the site, or turn it into a nature reserve, were snubbed. “It wasn’t even enough to say: ‘we will gift you the site’,” Sciabarrà told Corriere della Sera. “We got promises, but nothing else. Now, after a year, and with being worried about what looks like being another summer surge of tourists on the Scala, we are putting it up for auction, appealing first to Elon Musk.” The cliff, which is shaped like a huge staircase jutting into the Mediterranean from the coast of southern Sicily, has suffered erosion naturally but also from the huge number of tourists, some of whom have stolen pieces of rock, which consists of soft white limestone. In January, vandals defaced the landmark with red iron oxide powder. The site was temporarily closed and seized by prosecutors in early 2020 after complaints about its poor preservation. Sciabbarà was also investigated for crimes connected with the preservation of the site and ordered to pay a €9,100 (£7,600) fine last summer. “We wanted to donate it to the public administration, which remains ‘deaf’, we were also prevented from entrusting it to an environmental association,” Sciabarrà’s daughter, Angela, told Corriere. “Tourists should be allowed to visit safely with controlled access, and not via easily bypassable fences. Rockfall also needs to be prevented.”",News/World news,Sicilian offers Elon Musk chance to buy a slice of Scala dei Turchi cliff,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/sicilian-offers-elon-musk-chance-to-buy-a-slice-of-scala-dei-turchi-cliff
5/5/2022,"Anti-corruption campaigners and MPs have warned that “the kids of oligarchs” may have used their parents’ money to buy the right to live in the UK after it was revealed that the government granted “golden visas” to 46 people aged 21 or under. The Home Office on Wednesday disclosed that it approved 46 applications for the tier 1 investor visa scheme to those aged 21 or under over the last seven years, following a freedom of information request from Bloomberg. The golden visa scheme – which was scrapped in February over fears that it had been exploited by Russian oligarchs – was designed to attract wealthy people to the UK and required applicants to invest at least £2m. Thousands used it to secure fast-track rights to live and work in Britain, and the scheme was particularly popular with Russian and Chinese families. John Penrose, a Conservative MP who serves as “the prime minister’s anti-corruption champion”, said the revelation raised concerns that golden visas could have been “a loophole for kleptocrats’ children to live gilded lives in London funded by dirty money”. He added: “If golden visas were granted to the brightest and best young entrepreneurs, Britain will have benefited hugely from the jobs, energy and wealth which they will have created. “The answer is for the government to publish its long-promised review of golden visas, so we can see what really happened and when. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, as the saying goes.” It was previously revealed that eight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin were also granted golden visas to live in Britain. The Home Office has declined to name the sanctioned individuals who were given visas, and who Johnson described as having “the blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands”. Dr Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said the latest revelation of potential abuse of the golden visa scheme was “deeply concerning”. “Due to a loophole in the golden visa regime, there were little to no checks on the source of wealth if the money was gifted to the person applying for the visa,” she said. “This means the kids of oligarchs may have used their parents’ money, possibly obtained through corruption, to secure UK residency, exemplifying yet again how the regime facilitated the flow of dirty money into the UK. “The government urgently needs to publish a report on the national security risks golden visas posed, so that there is a fuller understanding of these risks, and appropriate action is taken.” Launched in 2008, but with its origins in an investor route dating back to 1994, the scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights along with their family. The speed with which applicants were given indefinite leave to remain was hastened by how much money they planned to invest in the UK: £2m took five years, while £10m – a higher option introduced in 2011 – shortened the wait to two years. After the 2018 Salisbury poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, a former Russian military officer and his daughter, the government launched a review into the investors who were awarded visas from 2008 to 2015. The review has yet to be published. During a “blind faith period” between 2008 and 2015, 97% of investors were subject to scant checks on the legitimacy of their wealth leading to concerns about undesirable people slipping into the country, say critics. According to Spotlight on Corruption, 6,312 golden visas – half the number of all those issued – had been reviewed for “possible national security risks”. Duncan Hames, director of policy at the anti-corruption campaign group Transparency International UK, said: “Media investigations, court cases and the occasional snippet from ministers have shed some light on the pasts of some visa recipients, but we are still largely in the dark about the true extent of abuse of the scheme. “The Home Office should publish its long-overdue review, with individual cases investigated where there are concerns that the applicants made their money through crime or corruption. Only through some genuine openness can we hope enough people will learn from the mistakes of the past.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have made it clear we will not tolerate abuse of our immigration system and we closed the tier 1 (investor) route to ensure those who have profited from dirty money cannot gain access to the UK. “The new Economic Crime Act, which received royal assent after an expedited passage through parliament, delivers a package of measures to bring tougher sanctions against those who facilitate illicit finance in the UK and empowers law enforcement to investigate entities who do not comply.”",News/UK news,Children of oligarchs may have used parents’ funds for UK ‘golden visas’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/04/children-of-oligarchs-may-have-used-parents-funds-for-uk-golden-visas
5/5/2022,"Contact has been lost with Ukrainian troops staging a last stand inside Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks, the mayor of the devastated port city has said, as more civilians fled the city on evacuation buses. Vadym Boichenko told Ukrainian television “we have no way of knowing what’s going on, whether they are safe or not” after weeks of brutal bombardment that have reduced much of the city to rubble. It is not known whether any of the civilians trapped in the works, where about 200 people – including 30 children – remain, were among those who got out. The convoy of evacuation buses, organised by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, was heading for the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, said the governor of Donetsk province, Pavlo Kyrylenko, but was not expected to arrive on Wednesday. The Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik said 156 people had managed to leave Mariupol and reach the relative safety of Zaporizhzhia, 140 miles (230km) away, on Tuesday after at least 20 failed attempts to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal site. She told Sky News the main goal of aid workers “is to make sure we get out all the children”, adding: “It’s about 30 children who are still there. The most complicated step would be with the wounded soldiers, because Russia is not allowing them to get out.” Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the remaining Ukrainian forces in the plant were “securely blocked along the entire perimeter”. He claimed repeated proposals to “release civilians and lay down their arms” had been ignored. Ukraine on Wednesday accused Moscow of planning to stage a military parade in Mariupol on 9 May, when Russia traditionally celebrates its victory over the Nazis in the second world war with processions in dozens of cities. “Mariupol will become a centre of ‘celebration’,” Ukraine’s military intelligence said in a statement on social media. “The central streets of the city are urgently being cleaned of debris, bodies and unexploded ordnance.” It said an official from Russia’s presidential administration had already arrived in the city, now almost entirely under Russian control, for a “large-scale propaganda campaign. Russians will be shown stories of locals’ ‘joy’ at meeting the occupiers.” Azovstal evacuees who arrived in Zaporizhzhia were emotional. “We are so thankful for everyone who helped. There was a moment we lost hope, we thought everyone forgot about us,” said Anna Zaitseva, holding her six-month-old baby. Elyna Tsybulchenko, 54, said Russian forces “bombed like every second”. “Everything shook. Dogs barked and children screamed,” she told Agence France-Presse. “The hardest moment was when we were told our bunker would not survive a direct hit.” After failing to capture Kyiv, Moscow has refocused its efforts on gaining full control of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the eastern Donbas region, and securing a southern land corridor via Mariupol to occupied Crimea. Ukraine’s defence ministry said Russia was raising the tempo of its offensive and that it had conducted nearly 50 airstrikes on Tuesday. A ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, said artillery bombardments and airstrikes were also continuing on the Azovstal plant. The Kremlin’s official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied Ukrainian reports that Moscow’s forces were trying to storm the plant. “The order was publicly given by [Vladimir Putin] to cancel the storming,” Peskov said. “There is no storming.” On Wednesday both sides reported Russian strikes on key transport infrastructure around the western city of Lviv, near Poland, and in Transcarpathia, bordering Hungary. There were also fears the conflict could spill over into neighbouring Moldova. The European Council president, Charles Michel, offered the republic the EU’s “full solidarity” and support. “We plan to significantly increase our support to Moldova by providing its armed forces with additional military equipment,” he said during a visit. Russia’s defence ministry said it had disabled six railway stations in eastern Ukraine used to supply Ukrainian forces with western-made weapons; hit 40 Ukrainian military targets including four ammunition and arms depots; and fired two cruise missiles at military targets from a submarine in the Black Sea. Moscow had deployed 22 battalion tactical groups near the eastern Ukrainian town of Izium, apparently in a drive to capture the nearby cities of Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk in Donbas, British military intelligence said. Shoigu said his forces would consider Nato transport units carrying weapons in Ukraine as targets to be destroyed. The alliance has said individual member states are sending military supplies, but not troops. The defence ministry of neighbouring, pro-Russia Belarus has announced military drills, saying they posed no threat, but Ukraine’s border service said it could not exclude the possibility Belarusian forces might join Russia’s assault. “We are ready,” a spokesperson said. Ukraine remains defiant. “Russia struggles to advance and suffers terrible losses,” the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted. “Thus the desperate missile terror across Ukraine. But we are not afraid and the world should not be afraid either.”",News/World news,Contact lost with Ukrainian troops staging last stand in Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/contact-lost-ukraine-troops-staging-last-stand-mariupol
5/5/2022,"There was a moment on Tuesday afternoon when Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez, the comedian, set the tone yet again in Las Vegas. After all the hoopla and noise of his “grand arrival” in this gaudy old desert town, Álvarez smiled and turned quietly to his promoter Eddie Hearn. Álvarez is ready for his latest challenge as he prepares to climb yet another weight division to fight Dmitry Bivol for his WBA world light-heavyweight title on Saturday night. The jaunty Mexican band kept playing in the background and hundreds of cameras stayed fixed on Álvarez. But the best fighter in the world wanted a little laugh at his own expense. Álvarez took a menacing step towards Hearn as if he, rather than Bivol, would be his next opponent after, last September, he became the undisputed world super-middleweight champion. But being the unified champion is not enough. He relinquished his belts so he could move up to face Bivol, the smartest and most technically proficient light-heavyweight in the world. Álvarez, who is only 5ft 8in, stood close to Hearn and, slowly, lifted his head to stare upwards at the Essex promoter who towers over him. The contrast in size told its own amusing story as Álvarez produced a parody of the traditional face-off. Hearn tried to play his part but, as Álvarez maintained his steely gaze, he cracked up. For years Álvarez, who is 31 and has been boxing professionally since he was 15, hid his real self behind an unsmiling facade and the language barrier which prevented anyone outside of Mexico gaining insight into his personality. “He’s unbelievable company, so humble and funny, but when I signed him I told him he needs to start talking English,” Hearn says as he explains the change in Canelo and the droll bromance that has developed between them. The public school-educated promoter from Romford is the son of Barry Hearn, who brought boxing and darts to Britain to the masses in the 1980s and 90s. Álvarez grew up in poverty in Juanacatlán, near Guadalajara, where he sold ice-cream lollies from the age of six and was bullied because he had red hair, freckles and pale skin. They eventually called him “Canelo” because of his cinnamon colouring. Canelo learnt how to fight with an icy conviction which is now at its most obvious as he dominates world boxing. He has lost only once, to Floyd Mayweather Jr in 2013, in 60 fights and Hearn is smitten by his relentless conviction and easy-going character. “He was nervous about switching from Spanish but I said: ‘Mate, your English is perfect. It’s just confidence.’ He started rolling with it and his profile was transformed in America and the UK. People see him as a great character as well as an all-time great of boxing.” A turning point occurred last May, after Álvarez dispatched Billy Joe Saunders with brutal efficiency in Texas in front of a record crowd of 73,126. At the post-fight press conference, Álvarez was called out by Demetrius ‘Boo Boo’ Andrade. In responding to Andrade, a boring if awkward operator between the ropes, Álvarez slipped from mild bemusement to comic profanity. His repeated instruction to Andrade, to “get the fuck outta here”, delivered in a faux-American accent, went viral. Even the angriest people on Twitter realised Canelo was laughing rather than ranting. “He’s the easiest person I’ve ever dealt with in boxing and the pound-for-pound number one,” Hearn says. “Billy Joe threatened to walk away from that fight three days out. The ring was a standard 20 foot by 20 foot and he said: ‘I’m not fighting unless it’s 24 foot.’ We had to get someone to drive from Florida to Texas and build a new ring – it cost us $60,000. But I had to go to Canelo first and tell him.” Hearn grimaces. “I was shitting myself. I sat down with Canelo, looked him in the eye and said: ‘We’ve got a problem. Saunders will not fight unless it’s a 24 x 24 foot ring. He’s saying he’ll go home. I’ve got to be honest with you. I think he might.’ Canelo laughed and went: ‘It’s no problem. Give him the ring.’ I apologised because it gave a massive advantage to Saunders. Canelo said: ‘Eddie, it doesn’t matter. I’ll get him anyway.’ I couldn’t believe it. I’d been trying to pluck up courage to have that conversation and it just rolled off him. Canelo believes no-one can beat him. He seriously believes that if he fought Oleksandr Usyk [who beat Anthony Joshua to become the IBF, WBA and WBO world heavyweight champion] at cruiserweight he would win. At 200 pounds, I wouldn’t back against him.” Álvarez has already won world titles at five different weights – from welterweight to light-heavyweight. He is back at this unnatural weight, at light-heavy against the unbeaten Bivol, and the rest of the week is about to turn deadly serious. “It’s a really tough fight,” Hearn stresses, “because Bivol is fresh and he’s been waiting for this a long time. He’s massive compared to Canelo. He can punch, he’s got great feet. But when you’re as confident as Canelo you just say: ‘No problem.’ He always finds a way. “Canelo comes from poverty in Guadalajara and he’s won more belts and more money than you could imagine. He lives in outrageous luxury and has this great zest for life, for his family and golf and enjoying himself, but his seriousness inside the ring never changes. Imagine sitting in such comfort and then having to spar some 22-year-old kid who’s got nothing and wants to take your head off. Canelo could be having a laugh in the pool, or playing golf, but he still wants to fight and get better. He is a very funny guy but that drive makes him exceptional.”",Sport/Sport,Easygoing Canelo Álvarez gets serious to climb another weight division,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/04/easygoing-canelo-alvarez-gets-serious-to-climb-another-weight-division
5/5/2022,"Late-night hosts reacted to the leaked supreme court draft decision that would overturn Roe v Wade on Tuesday evening. “It’s important to remember how we got here,” said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. “Because keep in mind that poll after poll shows that a majority of Americans don’t want Roe v Wade to be overturned. But the GOP didn’t care about that, no. They didn’t care about winning over the people. They just cared about getting enough justices onto the court to get what they want.” Noah called the draft decision, first published by Politico, a “hostile takeover of America’s reproductive rights” by the five conservative justices: Samuel Alito, Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas. To those upset about the Supreme Court leak: sorry this decision to colonize every vagina in America wasn't given the respect and dignity it deserved. pic.twitter.com/ZcJYibJCfx Alito, who authored the draft opinion, argued that Roe could be overruled because “the inescapable conclusion is that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the nation’s history and traditions”. “According to this argument, there actually is no fundamental right for women to control their own bodies,” Noah interpreted. “Lawmakers could pass laws giving them that, but that right is not part of this nation’s history and traditions. Which is kinda true. I mean, the history of this nation is that man can control what women do, and that’s what we want to go back to, right?” he joked. But Roe has been settled precedent for half a century – “you want to talk about history and tradition? I would say that that’s a tradition at this point”, said Noah. “Like if you go without electricity for a weekend, you’re camping. If you go without it for 50 years, you’re Amish, motherfucker. That’s just who you are.” The court’s “reverse Uno card” of a half century of precedent was chilling and strange; Noah reminded that it wasn’t until the year after Roe v Wade that women got the legal right to have a credit card in their own name without a man. “I think we would all agree that it would be weird if the court was suddenly like ‘if the founders wanted women to have credit cards they would have said so!’” He also turned previously to outcry in rightwing circles over leak, which was unprecedented for the usually secretive court. “The conservative majority on the court has a fundamental right to choose when they want to release a decision into the world,” he deadpanned. “Imagine having some random person violate your privacy and make that choice for you. Who would do such a thing?” To those outraged over the leak, he added: “I’m really sorry that this decision to colonize every vagina in America wasn’t given the respect and dignity it deserved.” “Well, shit,” said Stephen Colbert to open Tuesday’s Late Show. He had planned to discuss the Met Gala’s Gilded Age theme, but “instead I’ve got to talk about another group of out-of-touch people in crazy outfits pretending that its 1895: the supreme court.” Colbert quoted from Alito’s draft decision, which proposed “an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of common law… “Because nothing says looking toward the future like adhering to the earliest days of common law,” the host said. “That’s why I believe that life begins at white landowning male and why horses who read should be arrested for witch mischief.” As for the four other justices in alignment with Alito: “Congratulations ladies, decisions about what you can do with your body are now being made with four old dudes and a woman who thinks The Handmaid’s Tale is a rom-com.” Alito’s writing in the decision was scathing; he called the 1973 decision “exceptionally weak” and “egregiously wrong from the start”. “So if these folks believe that Roe v Wade was so egregiously decided, why didn’t they tell the senators that during their confirmation hearings?” Colbert wondered, playing clips in which each conservative justice confirmed Roe was precedent and thus settled law of the land. “Well, because American voters support abortion in all or most cases at 80%. They knew if they were honest they wouldn’t get the job, so they lied. Which I think is perjury, but what do I know? I’m no supreme court justice – I’m not a good enough liar.”",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah on the supreme court leak: ‘A hostile takeover of America’s reproductive rights’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/04/late-night-trevor-noah-scotus-reaction
5/5/2022,"Mark Cavendish said on Wednesday that he is optimistic about his chances of adding to his tally of 15 Giro d’Italia stage wins as he prepares to return to the race for the first time since 2013. “I’ve prepared for this race where I didn’t prepare for the Tour [in 2021] so I’m quite relaxed,” said the British sprinter. “I’ve had a good buildup so I’m pretty happy with where I’m at.” This year’s Giro, uniquely, starts with three stages in Hungary, and with the finish of Friday’s stage one into Visegrad up a 5.6km drag, the 36-year-old does not expect to repeat his feat of 2009, when he pulled on the fabled pink jersey at the end of the opening leg. This is nothing to do with the lengthy fight to recover from a punctured lung sustained in the Gent six-day track race in November, but is simply because, as Cavendish said, “most of the pure sprinters won’t be in contention”. Nor is a repeat of his points classification title from 2013 on his mind, as that will distract from his target, snaffling as many of the potential seven sprint finishes as he can in the face of strong – and far younger - opposition, headed notably by last year’s two-times stage winner Caleb Ewan of Australia. However, if Cavendish were to get rolling as he did at last year’s Tour de France, he might advance in the table of stage winners in the three Grand Tours, where he currently lies third on 52 stages. Eddy Merckx is out of reach on 64, but 90s ace Mario Cipollini’s tally of 57 might just beckon the Manxman. Further ahead, Cavendish is not expected to travel to this year’s Tour, earmarked for his teammate Fabio Jakobsen, and this week he was keen to play down any hint of rivalry with the Dutchman, who has returned strongly from a serious sprint crash in 2020. “Fabio and myself have supported each other so much the last years. The last thing I want and the last thing he wants and the one thing that scares me about all this is for any sort of rivalry to be created between us, because we’ve been there for each other,” Cavendish said in conversation with The Breakdown podcast. “I’m quite reluctant to talk about it, because I don’t want to fall out with a mate because of something that’s out of our control. What’s in my control is not talking about it, so that those outside influences that are outside of my control don’t affect it.”",Sport/Sport,Cavendish confident of adding to Giro stage tally but rules out day in pink,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/04/mark-cavendish-confident-of-adding-to-giro-d-italia-stage-tally-but-rules-out-day-in-pink

5/5/2022,"The first signs of a backlash to a possible Swedish application to join Nato have emerged within the ruling Social Democrats, at the start of a critical month in which Sweden and neighbouring Finland are expected to move rapidly towards a decision. Sweden is due to publish a security policy assessment report by 13 May, two-weeks earlier than planned, which will involve representatives of all parties in Sweden’s parliament, the Riksdag. The foreign ministry is also due to issue a position paper, before a decision is taken by the coalition government, no later than 24 May. The Social Democrats are eager to avoid a split over an issue that challenges nearly 200 years of Swedish neutrality with a national election in the autumn. However, local media in Sweden reported the climate and environment minister, Annika Strandhäll, who is also the federal board chair of the women’s wing of the Social Democrats, as saying the faction had “a long history and struggle in matters concerning peace, disarmament, detente and military freedom of alliance”. Therefore, Strandhäll said: “[We] in the federal board have decided to remain in line with our congressional decisions that Sweden should be militarily non-aligned and stand outside Nato.” The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, has said he will make his views known by 12 May, giving himself time to react to what Vladimir Putin may say on Russia’s Victory Day on 9 May. Moscow has rejected reports that Putin will declare war on Europe on 9 May but it has threatened unspecified consequences if Nato accepts the two countries as members. There has been a sudden change in Finnish public opinion towards Russia after the invasion of Ukraine with many voters lacking trust in Russia, with whom Finland shares a 830-mile border with. Surveys of the Finnish parliament show close to two-thirds of ministers are in favour of Nato membership. The ruling Finnish Social Democrats are due to hold a debate on 14 May. The parliament is taking expert evidence on the plan, but opinion polls show steady support for membership in the wake of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. This increases to 80% if both the prime minister, Sanna Marin, and president back membership. President Niinistö is scheduled to make a two-day visit to Sweden later this month. The UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was in Finland on Wednesday in a show of solidarity as British troops took part in a joint exercises with Finnish, US and Estonian troops. Advocates of Nato membership support a joint application by both Finland and Sweden to be submitted to Nato ahead of its summit in Madrid on 29 June, to give Nato time to respond with an invitation to join. Finland seems determined to join even if Sweden pulls back. Wallace has been in discussion with the Finnish military about the type of military support the UK, and other Nato powers, could provide in the transition period between application and acceptance of full protection under Nato’s article 5. It is not expected that Nato forces would be stationed permanently in Finland in the transition period, but joint exercises might intensify. Finland has not experienced an increase in activity along its border with Russia, or disinformation attacks. But the country has taken steps to minimise its dependency on Russian energy by next winter.",News/World news,Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats divided on decision to join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/sweden-ruling-social-democrats-divided-on-decision-to-join-nato
5/5/2022,"Luis Díaz revved the engine, priming the afterburners. He blazed up the left, taking Juan Foyth, the Villarreal right-back, with him. He slowed and then he went again, purring away from him. The Liverpool winger had just entered as a half-time substitute in his team’s Champions League semi-final, second leg at the Estadio de la Cerámica and he was testing his marker, working out whether he had the beating of him. The answer was emphatic. He did. Díaz knew it. So did everyone and, as Liverpool set about starting Tuesday night’s tie – albeit 45 minutes late – it felt as though something had been plugged in, the power returning. For Jürgen Klopp, however, the catalyst lay elsewhere, in a detail closer to his heart, more fundamental. The Liverpool manager had watched everything go wrong in the first half, his team’s 2-0 first-leg lead wiped out – and it might have been worse. Alisson had been fortunate not to concede a penalty just before Francis Coquelin scored Villarreal’s second goal and it was one of those challenges that, no matter how many times you watched the replay, it was difficult to tell what the goalkeeper had taken first – the ball or Giovani Lo Celso. It was messy, rather like Liverpool’s performance; framed by doubt, the benefit of which probably saved Alisson in the eyes of the VAR jury. “The whole world thought the game was more 3-0 than 2-1,” Klopp said, going on to reveal that he wanted to show his players a clip at half-time of a positive moment to give them a lift. He would be told by his assistant Pete Krawietz that there was nothing available. There was no buildup play, no momentum, Liverpool scrambled by Villarreal’s fast start and Boulaye Dia’s third-minute opener. “We had 11 problems in the first half,” Klopp added, referring to each one of his players. But Klopp felt the situation turn when Naby Keïta did likewise on to a pass into a seam of space. The midfielder had Sadio Mané in front of him, plus others, including Díaz and, at last, Liverpool were looking forward. “We turned and we were running with four or five players towards their last line,” Klopp said. “Honestly, when I saw we could turn with the ball and for the first time pass through their line, I knew we had a good chance to turn it around.” It felt like a relatively small moment – not as eye-catching, for example, as Díaz’s menace. But when a team have a style as well-grooved as that of Liverpool, a way which works, which they all know does work and will continue to work, it does not take much for the certainty to return. It is what makes Liverpool such fearsome opponents. Even when they look down, there is always a way back and what was noticeable before they scored their three unanswered second-half goals to advance into the final in Paris on 28 May was the clarity of the thought processes, the calm after the first-half storm; the easy recalibration of the angles. Klopp talked of facing a “football problem” at half-time, specifically the way that Villarreal had marked man-for-man and how his front three – Mané on the left, Mohamed Salah on the right, Diogo Jota up the middle – had been too static. “You give the ball there [to the forwards] and Villarreal win the challenge,” Klopp said. “We couldn’t keep one ball in the front line in the first half because of the wrong movements.” And nor could Liverpool build through the midfield for similar reasons. When Thiago Alcântara dropped deep, he came under huge pressure and could not see the options that he wanted. “But if you press like Villarreal did, you open up other spaces,” Klopp said. “It wasn’t that Luis was the solution, it was that we moved more. The difference was what I was talking [to the players about] at half-time – that we started to do what we wanted to do in the first place. “The first goal that we scored from Fabinho … it was a situation where he offered a run in an area where he never was before in the game. Just being in the half-space, offering that run in behind. We passed the ball through and he is a bit lucky with the finish [the shot going through the legs of the goalkeeper, Gerónimo Rulli] but we had to break their lines.” It was not a classic Klopp comeback to rival those against Borussia Dortmund in 2016 and Barcelona three years later because Liverpool were not actually behind in the tie. This was what the players told themselves at the interval; it was 2-2, with the next goal standing to be crucial. And nor was it particularly wild – relying, say, on some moment of individual magic as certain clubs have done this season. Liverpool simply reset mentally and trusted that the victory would be theirs when – and not if – they played as they wanted to play, moved as they wanted to move. “To be fair, it was calm,” Andy Robertson, the left-back, said of the dressing-room mood at half-time. The football solution was structured, cohesive. This is what champion self-assurance looks like.",Sport/Football, Problem-solver Klopp presses reset to propel Liverpool into another final | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/04/jurgen-klopp-propels-liverpool-into-another-champions-league-final
