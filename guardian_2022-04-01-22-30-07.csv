4/1/2022,"It would be lovely to write about Frank Auerbach, just once, without mentioning his childhood, and I suspect the artist would prefer it. But as war once again destroys cities and people in Europe, his story has terrible relevance. Frank Helmut Auerbach was born in Berlin in 1931. When he was seven his Jewish parents sent him to Britain. He never saw them again: they died at Auschwitz. This orphan of the Holocaust is one of the great witnesses of the modern world. It’s frankly inexplicable that his portrait of Estella Olive West, called Head of EOW 1, and which belongs to Tate, is not on permanent view near the Rothko room at Tate Modern. But that’s all the better for the enterprising Newlands House Gallery, which has ransacked the Tate stores for a stunning group of Auerbachs, including this painting, that spend too much time locked away. They were commissioned and bought by one man, David Wilkie – not your stereotypical international collector with a superyacht, but an art-obsessed insurance clerk from Brentford. Head of EOW1 was not so much painted, in 1960, as built up in thick glutinous layers, like a sculpture made of oil paint. Auerbach makes a head that bulges forward from the little wooden panel in 3D, so you can walk around it and see it as an object in space. But it is also a painting, a tangled mass of congealed colours. The face is a shadowy mask superimposed on these furrows and ridges of red, orange and yellow. Like an optical illusion created by Hans Holbein, it changes depending where you stand, sometimes fading, then suddenly resolving so sharply you feel as if the real person has materialised in the room. She’s in good company. Some of Auerbach’s old friends are here, too, as fierce etched portraits: the ghosts of Lucian Freud and Leon Kossoff are so sharply delineated that the framed little sheets of paper seem to contain some precious piece of them. And that is what makes Auerbach a great artist. Again and again in this terrific selection in a spacious, meditative 18th-century house, you are gripped by fragments of human experience grasped so vividly and forcefully that they restore your sense of what it is to be human. Wilkie didn’t just collect Auerbach but formed a fruitful creative friendship with him. One of Wilkie’s notions was for Auerbach to paint a “portrait” of Bernini’s Ecstasy of Saint Teresa in Rome. Auerbach said he would rather paint the father of punk poetry Arthur Rimbaud in a baroque setting. A giant caricature of Rimbaud lit by candles like an icon towers over visitors to a grandiose theatre-like space in his disorienting 1975-76 work Rimbaud. Auerbach uses the same eerie architecture of struts and girders he’d discovered while painting postwar London building sites to carve a deep, uneasy pictorial space, with Rimbaud suspended on scaffolding over a void. Is this a homage or a satire? Maybe it is an image of modern art itself, hovering over the abyss. In fact, this compelling picture has much in common with the paintings of modern history Anselm Kiefer and Georg Baselitz were creating in Germany in the 1970s. It goes to show you can’t pin down Auerbach to the dated and confused idea of a “School of London” supposedly dedicated to figurative art. His paintings gobble up reality but explode with abstraction and fantasy. Wilkie seems to have encouraged that. Auerbach’s painting of a fire-blasted Hampstead Heath called The Origin of the Great Bear came about when Wilkie challenged him to paint a myth from Ovid’s Metamorphoses that had been missed by Titian. And in the final stunning works here, also from Wilkie’s estate and owned by Tate, he takes on Titian in a dazzling battle of paint. Bacchus and Ariadne transforms Titian’s famous painting of a princess encountering the god of wine and his crazed followers into slashes and streaks of fleshy red against ethereal blue. In his two Studies after Titian done in 1965, he turns a cruel classical tale into modern horror. These thickly encrusted, squirming, formidable panels riff on Titian’s late, violent painting Tarquin and Lucretia. It is a rape. Auerbach cuts the frenzied attack into the paint itself, a massed scab of loaded colours. In Study after Titian II the face of Lucretia forms as a mask of terror, her eyes black pools, her arms helplessly raised against human evil.

4/1/2022,"Sarah Hawkins could barely look at the photos of the families affected by the Shrewsbury maternity scandal as they responded to a landmark review this week. “It’s so difficult even to look at those pictures because I can feel their emotions,” said Hawkins, whose daughter Harriet was stillborn, nine hours after dying, at the end of a six-day labour at Nottingham city hospital in 2016. “Taking out all the emotions, [the Shrewsbury report] was like a copy and paste of Nottingham. Here, we’ve got dead babies, we’ve got harmed mothers, we’ve got hypoxic babies. It’s absolutely awful.” What happened in Shrewsbury and Telford is considered the worst maternity scandal in NHS history. But in Nottingham and East Kent, where maternity care failures have also been identified, families are still waiting to find out the full scale of the problem. A review into maternity services at Nottingham university hospitals NHS trust is under way, with the number of families coming forward increasing from 84 to 387 in just a few weeks. “We’ve got a private Facebook group just for peer support and we’ve got over 103 people,” said Hawkins. “If Nottingham isn’t on the same scale as Shrewsbury, it’s going to be more. It’s just absolutely horrifying. And I think there will be so many people out there coming forward now and saying, ‘Oh my God, I wasn’t the only one.’” East Kent hospitals university NHS foundation trust is the subject of a government-ordered review of its maternity care, led by Dr Bill Kirkup, after it emerged a number of babies had died after receiving what their families said was poor care. “So much of the Ockenden review is so resonant. It’s painful to deal with,” said Helen Gittos, who lost her daughter Harriet eight days after she was born in 2014. She was transferred to hospital after experiencing difficulties during a home birth, but waited more than an hour to see a consultant, and staff went on to claim she had turned down medical intervention, which she refutes. “The way in which I was blamed for what happened was a very difficult thing to deal with. But to learn so many people have experienced the same thing is shocking,” she said. “There is a special kind of awfulness about finding out that none of the awful things that have happened to you are terribly special.” Reading the Ockenden review was also particularly hard for families affected by the Morecambe Bay inquiry in 2015, which found maternity services were beset by a culture of denial, collusion and incompetence from 2004-2013. “I had a huge sense of deja vu and of sadness and frustration,” said James Titcombe, whose son Joshua died in 2008 after hospital staff failed to pick up on signs of an infection for almost 24 hours. “I was really struck by how similar the findings are.” He said he was frustrated to see the same problems highlighted in the Morecambe Bay report still being reported elsewhere, and said people were “just kidding themselves” if they thought the trusts under investigation were “unique one-offs”. “The problem with Morecambe Bay, I think, was that there was a tendency to dismiss it as a one-off,” he said. “It diminished the need for the whole system to change. We mustn’t make that mistake now with Shrewsbury and Telford. Or we’ll be back here again.” Titcombe said that while there had been some improvement since the Morecambe Bay investigation, and ONS data showed stillbirths and neonatal deaths had come down, much more needed to be done, and families expressed scepticism about whether the Ockenden report would result in lasting change. “It doesn’t take much to look at Ockenden, and think, ‘Oh my God, a checklist of changes is not enough’. How do you embed a completely different cultural change in attitudes?,” asked Gittos. “There aren’t enough staff, and the staff that are there are too fearful to ask for help or raise concerns. That does not make me feel very hopeful.” Hawkins said: “From Nottingham, our own experience is that they say they’ll change, and they don’t. This has all been going on for years, it’s the same things being highlighted and highlighted. “We’re a growing group of bereaved, harmed families, and people are telling stories we can’t even believe. We don’t know what justice is. But I feel like we’re maybe getting to a place where people are finally listening to us.” A spokesperson for Nottingham university hospitals said: “We would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr and Mrs Hawkins for failures in the care around the delivery of baby Harriet. Our maternity improvement programme has introduced a number of improvements, including better training and monitoring with renewed focus on the recruitment and retention of midwives and maternity teams to ensure that we offer the best services possible to every family in our care.” Sarah Shingler, chief nursing and midwifery officer for East Kent hospitals, said: “The death of a baby is a truly devastating experience for a family and our thoughts are with Ms Gittos. We are truly sorry for the failings in our care for her and baby Harriet. We have since made significant changes to our maternity service to improve the safety and quality of care for every family.”",News/Society,‘Sense of deja vu’: other maternity victims say Shrewsbury not a one-off ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/01/sense-of-deja-vu-other-maternity-victims-say-shrewsbury-not-a-one-off
4/1/2022,"The scandal of avoidable baby deaths in Shrewsbury, England, was partly caused by an obsession with natural birth, an independent inquiry found this week. A 234-page report was deeply critical of the culture at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust, where staff deliberately sought to keep caesarean section rates low. In some cases women were denied caesarean sections when they should have been offered one. As a result, some were forced to endure extreme pain to try to achieve a vaginal birth, sometimes with harmful and even fatal consequences for their baby. The culture in Shrewsbury originated from the “normal birth movement” during the 1980s, when concerns started to be raised about the increasing use of medical intervention in childbirth. Vaginal birth is a natural and physiological process. However, in certain circumstances, a caesarean section may be needed to protect the woman and the baby’s health. A caesarean can be advised as a planned procedure or done in an emergency if it is thought a vaginal birth would be too risky. In these circumstances, underuse of caesarean sections, the likes of which occurred in Shrewsbury, contributes to an increased risk of poor outcomes. At the same time, overuse, where the use of caesarean section has no medical indication, may lead to harm and a waste of resources. A caesarean section is a major operation that carries a number of risks, so it is usually only done if it is the safest option for the woman and their baby. Striking that balance when it comes to risk is why optimising the use of caesarean section is a global concern and a major public health challenge. Worldwide, the picture is a mixed bag with wildly different rates. Overall, caesarean section rates continue to increase across high-income, middle-income and low-income countries. In a study published in the BMJ Global Health journal last year, the latest available data showed that 21.1% of women give birth by caesarean section worldwide. The proportion is about one in four in the UK. However, averages range from 5% in sub-Saharan Africa to 42.8% in Latin America and the Caribbean. While in sub-Saharan Africa an average of 5% indicates underuse, the average of 42.8% in Latin America and the Caribbean is suggestive of overuse. Projections show that by 2030, 28.5% of women worldwide will give birth by caesarean section, ranging from 7.1% in sub-Saharan Africa to 63.4% in Eastern Asia. The variations show the challenge facing the world. In some areas, particularly poorer countries, women who would benefit from caesarean section are unable to have the procedure because of the financial and human resources required. At the same time, in other areas, rates are climbing extremely rapidly, prompting concerns over the health consequences of unnecessary or unsafely conducted operations. In 1985, the World Health Organization (WHO) said countries should not have a caesarean rate higher than 10-15%. Today, those specific target rates have been dumped and the WHO does not recommend specific rates in populations or hospitals, reflecting the importance of focusing on a woman’s unique needs in pregnancy and childbirth. More women than ever are giving birth in healthcare facilities, but in many parts of the world, the quality of care is poor, which has a negative effect on the health and wellbeing of the woman and their baby. It is vital all women are able to talk to health staff and be part of the decision-making on their birth, receiving adequate information on their mode of birth including the risks and benefits.",News/Society,What is the ‘normal birth movement’ and why can it be harmful?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/01/what-is-the-normal-birth-movement-and-why-can-it-be-harmful
4/1/2022,"I have two wonderful sons aged seven and three. My issue is that my older son does not understand that his brother has additional needs and resents the extra attention he gets. My youngest is being assessed for autism, and has significant traits. He needs constant supervision and has routines that must be followed or he gets distressed. Our eldest finds this frustrating and blames his brother for ruining everything. My eldest is very bright and engaging. He demands attention and has always been melodramatic, even at a young age. He gets frustrated his brother won’t play with him and says he’s weird. When the youngest does his routines with chairs, toys, cups etc, the eldest will call him weird and seek to disrupt things. The youngest will react if what he is doing is messed up, but he ignores his older brother – and all other children – most of the time. I want them to have the best sibling relationship possible but it would help if my little one gave his brother something back. We have told our older son that his brother needs more help with some things. I think he just thinks he’s being difficult or we’re pandering to him. A diagnosis is some way off – but I don’t want to label him prematurely. How can we make my eldest son understand more and be a bit more empathetic to his little brother? Any help much appreciated. What a lot you all have on your plate. As a parent, you have all the usual hurdles with making things fair between siblings, and on top of that a younger child with additional needs. But as you say, your eldest is very young to understand it all. There’s a tendency to see older siblings as much bigger than they are when a younger sibling comes along. I went to Sibs, which helps siblings of disabled children and adults, and spoke to Linda Owen, the information officer for young siblings. We thought you might be expecting your eldest son to understand a lot – too much. All you can really do at this age is acknowledge his feelings, not tell him what he should or shouldn’t be feeling. “What’s most helpful,” Owen says, “is to say something like: ‘I know it’s annoying that we have to follow all these routines. That must make you really sad/frustrated.’” Even a simple “This is hard for you, isn’t it?” can be empowering. Try to acknowledge things from his point of view, instead of asking him to be OK with the situation, and to look at things from his brother’s. Also remember: children blame themselves, so he may feel some of this is his fault. “The danger here is that you don’t want your older son to feel he has to be good, to not cause any trouble,” says Owen. It must also be frustrating for your eldest if he feels he might never come first again, that his needs will never supersede his brother’s. How much time do you spend just with your eldest? Owen recommends carving out regular, ringfenced time every day. “Better five minutes a day, every day, than an hour a week [that you may need to renege on].” Owen also recommends involving his school, if possible, and telling them what is going on for him. Young Sibs provides a service where your son can write in and get a personal response, and there is lots on its website that you and he can go through together. The links are below. But please remember to make time that’s also for him, and about him, and has nothing to do with his brother.

4/1/2022,"New laws allowing health workers involved in medical blunders in England to give evidence in secret mean future maternity scandals may remain uncovered, the NHS ombudsman has warned, as he says the “shocking” baby deaths in Shrewsbury are not a one-off. The government’s health and care bill, passed on Wednesday, means NHS staff can give evidence about clinical mistakes privately in a “safe space”. But Rob Behrens, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman, says the change means he and his staff will not be able to get to the bottom of medical failings because his office will be denied access to that vital information. In a bitter irony, the shakeup of health investigation rules was slipped through the Commons on the same day the report into the biggest maternity scandal in the history of the NHS was published. “We have now been effectively excluded from the so-called safe space,” Behrens said. “There is a serious risk of women who directly experienced maternity service failure not being able to hold the service to account as a result of the change in the law.” Under the changes, the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB), set up in 2017 by the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to improve patient safety after the Stafford hospital scandal, will be renamed the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB). The new body can collect secret evidence from midwives, nurses and doctors involved in avoidable deaths and patient safety lapses but this information cannot be shared with anyone else except coroners. “It means that if the new body, in successor to HSIB, decides to launch an investigation into a maternity crisis like the one in Shrewsbury, then they would have the right to take the views of clinicians, without the clinicians being held accountable for what they did, in terms of the evidence which they gave to HSIB,” said Behrens. “And that is a great concern. It’s a violation of accountability. The only way we could stop it would be to go to the high court.” He spoke out after the final report from the independent inquiry into Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust found 201 babies and nine mothers could have or would have survived if an NHS trust had provided better care. The failings in Shrewsbury could be the tip of the iceberg, Behrens suggests. “We do have a significant number of not only health service cases but maternity cases. I’ve looked at a considerable number of deaths as a result of perinatal incidents.” Shrewsbury is not alone in having its maternity services scrutinised by other bodies, with reports expected later this year into Nottingham University Hospitals and East Kent Hospitals University NHS foundation trust, seven years after an inquiry was held into another maternity scandal, at Furness general hospital in Barrow. “The thing that strikes me is that if you compare the Ockenden report with the Kirkup report of 2015 in Morecambe Bay, you have to ask the question, why are things happening time and time again when they should be stopped after the first example of it happening? “You get politicians who have said after Morecambe Bay, ‘This should never happen again.’ And I heard politicians in the House of Commons say exactly the same thing [this week]. But it does do. And that is a collective failure.” Behrens says he was struck by the battle campaigning mothers such as Rhiannon Davies and Kayleigh Griffiths faced in Shrewsbury for many years to get to the truth. “I take my hat off to the integrity and the persistence of those people who had tragedies and [were] still determined to find out what happened. It’s taken years out of their lives, and that is to be deeply respected. It shouldn’t have to happen. “These women and their families were let down by shocking levels of maternity care with devastating consequences. What exacerbates the catalogue of errors over many years is that the voices of victims and the families were never heard, and they were even blamed for the outcomes. That is disgraceful.” Behrens added: “This report should be a wake-up call for maternity care services and trusts. I echo Donna Ockenden’s view that maternity care should be properly funded, staff well trained, and, when things do go wrong, trusts must listen to the people affected and learn from their mistakes.”",News/Politics,"Future maternity scandals may stay uncovered, NHS ombudsman warns",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/01/maternity-scandals-england-new-law-nhs-ombudsman-warns
4/1/2022,"At the Sugar House distillery in Dumbarton, there’s a stag’s head on the wall. That’s not unusual for Scotland, you might say, and you’d be right – except that this one is used as a hatstand – a metaphorical two fingers to the traditional image of the distilling industry, and the distillery is not set in the rolling acres of the Highlands, but a somewhat scruffy industrial unit on the outskirts of town. Sugar House is one of three distilleries that produced huge online spirits retailer The Whisky Exchange’s spirits of the year. Coincidentally (or maybe not), the winners are all Scottish. “We didn’t actually realise the Scottish connection until a few days after we had all the winners,” the site’s co-founder Sukhinder Singh says incredulously. The tradition of drinking rum is firmly established in Scotland, especially in Glasgow, where there were once four sugar houses, as rum distilleries were known. And they make it from scratch: “We’re such a small-scale outfit that we can make anything we want,” says Sugar House’s distiller Ross Bradley. And they do: witness their 47% Scotch Bonnet Spiced Rum, which will blow your head off. Over at the Holyrood distillery in Edinburgh, it’s the juniper-rich Height of Arrows gin (£28.95, 43%) that caught the attention of the Whisky Exchange’s buyers, but I’m equally grabbed by its “new-make” spirits (effectively, unaged whiskies) that owe their flavour to a range of speciality malts. (Distillery manager Marc Watson used to be a brewer, and that has influenced Holyrood’s ingredient-led approach to distillation.) Gin is also a focus at Thompson Bros, a new organic distiller housed at Dornoch Castle hotel on the east coast that, remarkably, makes the fantastically summery Mediterranean gin in today’s pick. They started out as an independent bottler, but, thanks to a crowdfunding campaign, are now making their own spirits. Then there are distilleries such as Deanston, which has been going for a while as a component of better-known brands but is now striking out in a more innovative direction under new distiller Brendan McCarron. Although Deanston won whisky of the year for its 18-year-old, it’s the brand’s much younger, seductively creamy Virgin Oak bottling (see today’s pick) that’s McCarron’s own favourite. Apparently, the secret is an unappealing-looking tank of black gunge called the feints receiver, which is redistilled and contributes to the spirit’s particularly waxy character. And that’s only dipping a toe into the trend towards sustainable distilling, but that will have to keep for another week. Scottish distilling is really on a roll right now.

4/1/2022,"The Conservative peer chosen to lead the communications watchdog has a “clear lack of depth” of knowledge about social media and online safety, according to a report by MPs that described the hiring process for Ofcom’s new chair as a “shambles”. Michael Grade is in line to oversee regulation of the internet in the UK after the government named the 79-year-old as the preferred choice to lead the regulator. However, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee said on Friday that it was concerned by Grade’s admission this week that he does not use social media but is aware of how it works thanks to his children. “His clear lack of depth when talking about social media and online safety gives us concerns,” said the committee in a report published on Friday. Ofcom will play a key role in regulating large social media platforms and search engines in the UK, as the body charged with implementing the landmark online safety bill, which is due to become law by the end of the year. The report added that it would be difficult to find a candidate with deep experience across the whole of Ofcom’s remit and expressed hope that Grade, who has had a long career as a broadcasting executive, would receive advice on the tech aspects of his £142,500 a-year role. “He appears to understand the importance of Ofcom’s new role in regulating the online space. It would be difficult to find a candidate with deep experience across the whole of Ofcom’s remit, and we hope that he will be well supported with the necessary advice to fulfil his role as chair.” Despite concerns over perceived gaps in Grade’s knowledge, the committee’s Conservative chair, Julian Knight MP, said the candidate had impressed in a pre-confirmation hearing on Thursday. “Lord Grade impressed during the hearing and clearly has the character and gravitas for the role,” he said. Knight added that Grade would bring a wealth of broadcasting experience to the three-day-a-week job, having carried out leadership roles at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. The committee, which does not have the power to block Grade’s appointment, was scathing about a hiring process that has taken two years and involved failed attempts to install the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre in the chair role. Knight said: “This shambles of a process gives us great concern about the department’s ability to run effective and impartial public appointment competitions.” Grade has said if his appointment is confirmed he will resign the Conservative whip and become a crossbench peer. In a written response to the committee, Grade also appeared to warn that the online safety bill would not eradicate online harms overnight. “There will be huge expectations that Ofcom will overnight reduce or even eliminate online harms as a result of the online safety bill. Until the bill has become law, it is hard to evaluate this risk or the expectations of Ofcom’s ability to ‘rein in’ the big online platforms.”",News/Media,MPs voice fears over Michael Grade’s social media knowledge for Ofcom job,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/01/mps-voice-fears-over-michael-grade-in-depth-knowledge-of-ofcom-remit
4/1/2022,"A landscape painting considered to have been the work of a Rembrandt pupil has been confirmed as having been executed by the Dutch master himself. In what has been described as a coup for curators at Berlin’s Gemäldegalerie, which owns the painting, Landscape with Arched Bridge is now considered a direct work of the 17th-century painter, Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn. For decades it had been attributed to one of his pupils, Govert Flinck. Painstaking technical analysis of the small work, dated from 1638, which measures just 28.5cm by 39.5cm, confirmed the longstanding belief of a number of Rembrandt experts who had questioned the work’s demotion in 1989. Katja Kleinert, the curator for Dutch and Flemish art of the 17th century at the Gemäldegalerie used the occasion of the work’s planned appearance in an exhibition of the British artist David Hockney, which opens on 89 April, as an opportune moment to analyse the picture as part of the Rembrandt Research Project. X-rays showing changes and corrections that had been made to the work helped confirm Rembrandt as its creator. Kleinert said experts were unanimous in their verdict. Comparisons were made with a very similar composition by Rembrandt, called Landscape with Stone Bridge at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which the Gemäldegalerie’s director, Dagmar Hirschfeld – herself a Rembrandt expert – said shared hallmarks typical for him. “You quite often get pairs of paintings, where you have the impression he is trying to do the same again, but in another style of painting or to optimise what he has already achieved,” she said. Analysis of the painting in Berlin, which the gallery acquired in 1924, showed how Rembrandt had made radical changes to the work during its creation, including shifting the position of a storm cloud, reducing the size of a hill and making changes to a group of trees. These processes in turn made the painting more compact and dense. Specialist examination brought clarity to the way the composition was developed, each change enhancing the masterful Rembrandt style of chiaroscuro – or contrasting light and shadow. The investigation also established that the Berlin work, contrary to previous understanding, was created before and not after the Amsterdam work, which is more exact and translucent. Experts from the Rembrandt Research Project, set up in 1968 to oversee all research and discoveries about the artist, drew attention to the striking stylistic, technical and thematic similarities between the works, which had previously given art historians reasons to argue the painting was by an extremely capable Rembrandt successor or imitator. Hirschfeld said the experts’ findings would be documented and published. The promotion of the work from a Flinck to a Rembrandt, means its value will soar to more than €10m (£8.4m). Not that the work is expected to go up for sale. “It is relevant only in the case of the painting being loaned to another exhibition,” according to a spokesperson for the museum. Landscape with Arched Bridge can be seen as part of the exhibition David Hockney – Landscapes in Dialogue. It includes Hockney’s monumental four-season series, Three Trees near Thixendale from the Würth Collection in Berlin. The works are set against paintings by Rembrandt – of which the gallery owns 20 – and other masters of landscape painting who have inspired Hockney, in what the Gemäldegalerie has described as a “striking conversation”. Rembrandt painted relatively few landscapes. Until now, only seven were thought to exist.",Arts/Art and design,Painting credited to Rembrandt pupil confirmed as work of Dutch master himself,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/01/rembrandt-pupil-painting-confirmed-work-of-dutch-master-landscape

It is two months since the Kirkcaldy club signed David Goodwillie, who in a landmark case in 2017 was ordered to pay damages to the woman he was found by a civil court to have raped. The move resulted in a ferocious backlash which escalated across the first week of February, with sponsorship withdrawals, multiple resignations and the women’s team moving to sever ties. By the end of the week, the Scottish Championship club had admitted “we got it wrong” and promised not to select the player. Yet the noisy condemnation did not deter Goodwillie’s former club, Clyde, from agreeing a loan deal at the beginning of March, which was terminated days later after the local council announced it was banning the striker from the ground. Now the Scottish National party MP Hannah Bardell, who spent four years working at Livingston FC, has written to the Scottish Football Association asking it to consider a fit and proper person test for professional players in the wake of events which, she writes, sent the message that “men’s careers are more important than women’s safety”. “Footballers, particularly male footballers, are paid significant sums of money and hold a particular status that often makes them role models,” says Bardell. “It’s only right that our footballing authorities have a fit-for-purpose system of deciding who can hold that position.” Bardell is asking for a meeting between the SFA, the best-selling author Val McDermid, a dedicated Raith supporter who withdrew her shirt sponsorship immediately after Goodwillie was signed, and the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley. “Culture change is not something you can easily legislate for,” McDermid says. “But what I would like to see is clubs taking much more responsibility for the behaviours of the players off the pitch and for indicating that certain behaviours are just not acceptable.” The events of early February were a watershed moment, says Andy Smith, chair of the Scottish Football Supporters’ Association: “Women’s football now has clout and a growing voice. It is the most important dynamic in football and the women’s game in Scotland is developing fast and strengthening commercially.” Nevertheless, when the organisation partnered with Her Game Too, the campaign to stamp out sexism in the stands, at the end of February, their survey found one in four female fans had encountered abuse at matches. The row in Scotland unfolded as allegations of sexual violence emerged against players in the English Premier League including Mason Greenwood and Benjamin Mendy, prompting the feminist group Level Up to write to the CEOs of the FA and Premier League urging them to tackle gender-based violence. The campaigns director Janey Starling says: “There’ s a lot of energy from the fans who want to see clubs do better and are very disappointed that stories flare up then disappear, because the issues don’t go away. There is a recognition amongst management and supporters that this is a huge problem and there’s a need for systemic change – this is not just a few bad apples.” Their demands are echoed by the Scottish campaign group Zero Tolerance, which coordinated a statement of zero tolerance of violence against women on International Women’s Day, 8 March, supported by about 70 organisations, mainly football clubs, although with some notable Premiership absences. (Goodwillie’s victim, Denise Clair, later accused the SFA of hypocrisy in backing the campaign after refusing to take action against the footballer.) “We were delighted with the take-up of the campaign,” says the co-director Rachel Adamson, “but it’s easy to send a tweet, and now we need leadership. We need systemic change and action. We would like to see the big names in Scottish football reflect on what changes they need to make and work with experts on ending men’s violence against women to make their organisations and community gender equal.” The SFA launched its first dedicated girls’ and women’s football strategy in partnership with Uefa last year, and points to the work of its equality and diversity advisory board, established in 2017, and its equality vision, which states: “Everybody should have the opportunity to participate in football at all levels, and that no individual should be discriminated against for any reason.” Crucially, the Scottish football community could come together to reframe a push for zero tolerance as not just a women’s issue, Adamson says. That was evident amid the genuine distress and outrage of Raith fans in February. A Crowdfunder for Rape Crisis Scotland set up by a 26-year-old fan, Martin Glass, has raised £15,000. The ripple effect has been UK-wide, says McDermid, who tells how her biggest round of applause at the Oxford Literary Festival last weekend was for her stance over Raith Rovers. “I’ve taken aback since February by the responses I’ve had out and about, people coming up to me on trains and in the shops to express their disgust at what happened, and delight that some of us stood up against it. I don’t think that would have happened five years ago. The whole wave that happened in the wake of MeToo has shifted the dial.” Marie Penman, who resigned from her job at Raith’s community foundation on 1 February, has not been to Stark’s Park since. The management’s statements – at first dismissing the signing as a “football-related decision” – and behaviour since – they refused to offer any comment for this article – “were just so shocking and so far from what I thought we should be as a club”. Instead, she has been spending her weekends watching the renamed Raith women’s team, McDermid Ladies, who won their opening SWFL North/East league game last Sunday against Bayside Women. “It’s really quite refreshing,” she says.",Sport/Football,SFA urged to consider fit and proper person test for players after Goodwillie backlash,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/01/sfa-urged-to-consider-fit-and-proper-person-test-for-players-after-david-goodwillie-backlash
4/1/2022,"Gas and electricity company websites have been jammed since Thursday, collapsing under a deluge of customers rushing to submit meter readings before the 1 April regulated energy price cap increase in Great Britain. No. If you read your meter on 31 March you can still submit the reading and get the units you had used before the change charged at the old rate. Providers are saying that customers can send in readings over the next few days – some are being less specific than others about whether there is a deadline. At E.ON, customers have until Saturday 9 April to go online and submit their meter readings for 31 March. A spokesperson adds: “Smart meter customers do not need to do anything as their readings will automatically be shared with us.” EDF says its customers can share meter readings “over the coming days and into next week and we will adjust the account accordingly”. Scottish Power is accepting readings online and via its app. British Gas has a form on its website that customers can fill in with Thursday’s meter reading and says this will remain available next week. Anyone who received a text from the company on Thursday asking for a reading can still reply. Not if you are a customer of Octopus – its prices do not actually rise until Saturday. Customers will then have a week to submit their readings. Rising monthly direct debits have prompted some energy customers to consider switching their arrangements and paying when they receive their bills. Before you do this, check that it will not end up costing you more. The price cap for customers who pay in this way is £130 a year higher than for direct debit customers, and you could find that your standing charges and unit rates rise. At British Gas, for example, paying in this way attracts a standing charge of 51p on electricity and a unit rate of 30p, against a 45p standing charge for direct debit customers and a unit rate of 28p. SSE says on its website that switching from on-demand payment to direct debit could save its customers up to £129 a year. If you are having problems with the new prices there may be help available from your provider. Most have funds to support their most vulnerable customers and will tell you if you qualify, and should be able to point you towards other help and advice. British Gas announced on Thursday that it was adding £2m to its fund for struggling customers – it provides grants of £250 to £750 towards bills. If you have less than £1,000 in savings and need help you can apply. It has another fund to help customers of other energy companies – this is currently closed but will open again on 1 July.",Lifestyle/Money,Is it too late to submit a meter reading?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/01/is-it-too-late-to-submit-a-meter-reading-energy-prices
4/1/2022,"India will quickly cut tariffs on Australian lamb, wool and rock lobsters as part of a new trade deal, while it may take up to a decade to scale back imposts on a range of other products. The Morrison government is due to sign an interim trade deal with India on Saturday, in the latest sign the Coalition is clearing the decks for the start of the formal election campaign when caretaker conventions will apply. India is Australia’s seventh-largest trade partner, but attempts to diversify trade have taken on extra urgency given the increasingly rocky relationship with top-trading partner China. The interim trade deal is three months later than the original deadline, suggesting there were several sticking points in the negotiations, and the full text has yet to be released. The Australian government said tariffs would quickly be eliminated on more than 85% of Australian exports to India, valued at more than $12.6bn a year. That would rise to almost 91%, or exports valued at $13.4bn, over 10 years, according to the government. Meanwhile, about 96% of goods imports from India are expected to enter Australia duty-free when the agreement takes effect. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the interim agreement, to be signed in a virtual event on Saturday, “opens a big door into the world’s fastest growing major economy for Australian farmers, manufacturers, producers and so many more”. Australia has offered to provide new access for young people from India to participate in working holidays in Australia, with places set at 1,000 a year. The Australian government argued the move would “contribute to both workforce requirements and to boost tourism to support our post-Covid recovery”. Indian students with a bachelor’s degree with first-class honours will also be allowed to stay in Australia for three years after their graduation, rather than the current two years. This applies only to the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors. Australian agricultural exporters will be anxious to see improved market access to India, in light of the trade actions taken by China over the past two years. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There will be an immediate elimination of tariffs on Australian fresh rock lobster, which has experienced disruption in the trade tensions with Beijing. Australian wine exporters, however, will have to wait for the full benefits, with tariffs on wine bottles with a minimum import price of US$15 expected to reduce from 150% to 75% when the agreement enters into force. This tariff will then reduce to 25% over 10 years. The Australian government said sheep meat tariffs of 30% would be eliminated when the deal enters into force, “providing a boost for Australian exports that already command nearly 20% of India’s market”. “Wool will have the current 2.5% tariffs eliminated on entry into force, supporting Australia’s second-largest market for wool products,” the government said. India’s tariffs of up to 30% on a range of products including avocados, onions, kidney beans, cherries, macadamias and blueberries are expected to be eliminated over seven years. The deal, to be known as the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement, is also expected to reduce tariffs on Australian almonds, lentils, oranges, mandarins, pears, apricots and strawberries. Over five years, India is to eliminate tariffs on Australian infant formula, but the interim agreement does not appear to provide any other market access gains for the sensitive dairy sector.

In a clear pre-election pitch, Morrison said: “This is great news for lobster fishers in Tasmania, wine producers in South Australia, macadamia farmers in Queensland, critical minerals miners in Western Australia, lamb farmers from New South Wales, wool producers from Victoria and metallic ore producers from the Northern Territory.” Labor had previously accused the Coalition of not putting enough effort into deepening the economic relationship with India, despite “talking a big game with the India FTA for many years”. The opposition trade spokesperson, Madeleine King, predicted earlier this week “there may be some delivery in the minutes before midnight of an election”. The Australian trade minister, Dan Tehan, said the deal would “create new opportunities for jobs and businesses in both countries, while laying the foundations for a full free trade agreement” at a future date. Tehan and his counterpart, Piyush Goyal, will sign the interim deal in a virtual event to also be attended by prime ministers Morrison and Narendra Modi. Both governments are also expected to improve the recognition of professional qualifications, licensing and registration procedures in each country. Australian services suppliers in 31 sectors and sub-sectors – including higher education, banking and tourism – are also “guaranteed to receive the best treatment accorded by India to any future free trade agreement partner”, according to Morrison’s office.",News/Australia news,Australia to sign trade deal with India as Coalition clears decks for election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/australia-to-sign-trade-deal-with-india-as-coalition-clears-decks-for-election
