2/9/2022,"It’s a familiar scene. You’re perched in front of the TV, remote in hand, “deciding” on something to watch. There’s that show about the mafia, or the one about drugs, or that one about drugs and mafia? What about this new police one? It’s written by that bloke who did that other police one, I think he used to be in the police, or the mafia, or both? No? Well there’s that subtitled one we recorded? Mmm, bit too much of an investment, it’s only a Tuesday night after all and I sort of don’t want to have to watch the screen all of the time. Have a look what’s on “normal telly” now, there might be something good. There might! Just have a look! Cut to two hours later. The mafioso and police remain behind their respective thumbnails, unchosen, unwatched. Unsatisfied, you peel yourself off the sofa and shuffle off to bed. You’ve made a start on that book, maybe you’ll give that podcast a listen, there’s that one about … oh forget it. Welcome to the tyranny of choice.  Hold on. Having choice is a good thing, right? Well, yes. But too much choice can be harmful. Just ask Barry Schwartz. Just ask Jos Buttler. In fact, maybe give it a while with Jos. Schwartz is a psychologist and social theory professor. In a 2005 Ted Talk he explains that an “explosion of choice” has led affluent western societies towards “paralysis rather than liberation”. He merrily talks about his local store stocking 175 types of salad dressing or about the time he went to buy a new pair of jeans and was bamboozled by the different styles and fits. With so many choices to be made in everyday life, Schwartz argues that humans increasingly find it difficult to choose at all, and when they do, they are rarely satisfied with their decision. They’re haunted by the lingering thought of other options they could have chosen. His talk has been viewed 16m times. It made me think of Jos Buttler. Mark Ramprakash wrote a revelatory column for the Guardian a few weeks ago recalling a coaching session he had with a frustrated Buttler in Abu Dhabi in 2015, not long after the keeper-batter had been dropped from the Test side. Ramprakash mentioned Buttler had “a lack of trust in and understanding of first-class cricket”, that he was unsure of how to go about constructing an innings when faced with carte blanche and the scoreboard is not dictating the run rate and tempo as it does in white-ball cricket. “In that net session, I suggested I should throw him a few balls and he should play each ball on its merits,” Ramprakash wrote. “He seemed to not quite understand that concept. It led me to think there is so much premeditation in one-day cricket that some players who come through and excel in that format never adapt to the ebb and flow of Test cricket.” Renata Salecl, a Slovenian philosopher and theorist, called her 2011 book The Tyranny of Choice. She believes that choice “brings a sense of overwhelming responsibility into play, this is bound up with a fear of failure, a feeling of guilt and an anxiety that regret will follow if we make the wrong choice.” Could Buttler be suffering from the tyranny of choice? He’s a white-ball supremo. The bowler in coloured kit knows that Buttler can hit the exact same delivery in numerous different places, depending on the state of the game and the field placings. Take a length ball just outside off stump: he can step out and bunt it down the ground with just a flick of those meaty and pliable wrists. Or rock back and glide it through point. Step to leg and crash it over extra cover. Step to off and paddle it fine or slap it over midwicket. He can sweep, reverse-sweep, paddle-sweep, scoop, ramp, flick, tap, tickle and thwock. I’ll run out of verbs before Buttler runs out of scoring options, choices, to a single white ball. But in Test cricket, especially in the recent Ashes series, it’s a different story. Buttler is the panicked shopper, rendered paralysed by the choice on the condiment aisle or the dithering boxset doom-scroller. He scored 107 runs across eight innings at an average of 15.28 with a glacial strike rate of 27.43. Unsure of his process, continually bemused as to what his best option was in any scenario. Paralysis rather than liberation. Buttler faded throughout the series. With each passing game he looked more glum, upset, confused, frustrated. When Sam Billings replaced him in the final Test in Hobart, his Tiggerishness – is that a smile? Chatter and encouragement behind the stumps!? – only served to reinforce Buttler’s Eeyorish decline. England’s most successful man with the willow in Test cricket, Alastair Cook, he of the 12,472 Test runs, has often been described as only being in possession of three shots. Maybe four if you include the leave. With a cut, a pull and a nurdle off his hips being his mainstays, Cook had a limited array of strokes coupled with an absolute clarity of role and purpose. Three or four modes, slightly dull to watch at times but capable of breaking records and unifying a nation, Cook was the last terrestrial TV cricketer. No, not in actuality but you know what I mean. Buttler is at the peak of his powers in the white-ball game where more often than not there is a blueprint of how to play. The format determines it. Ramprakash recalls one of Buttler’s finest innings being the 75 against Pakistan at Old Trafford in 2020, a final day that more resembled a ODI match – a run chase, a time constraint, an equation to work with. Choice narrowed by the game situation. Very much Buttler’s meat and drink. It’s not just Buttler, of course. Any number of England’s young male batters who have grown up playing all formats, who have all the shots at their disposal, struggle with how to go about putting an innings together in Test cricket. Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope, even the feast or famine of Ben Stokes suggests a lack of clarity and confidence in how to approach the open possibilities afforded by the longest format. How many of them, Buttler included, will continue to keep attempting to crack Test cricket? How many will cut their losses and head down a white-ball-only route? After recent performances, the choice might no longer be theirs to make. What a relief. This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

2/9/2022,"“Ithink it’s pretty fresh for an Indian audience,” says Deepika Padukone of her new movie, Gehraiyaan (“Depths”). “The way this story has been told, and the way in which it explores infidelity is certainly very new.” Gehraiyaan’s promotional material isn’t hiding anything, with clips showing Padukone’s character Alisha losing herself in clinches with her illicit lover Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi), her cousin’s fiance. If that wasn’t messy enough, Alisha also has a perfectly nice boyfriend of six years, Karan (Dhairya Karwa), who’s done nothing to deserve this betrayal. “She feels stuck,” is how Padukone explains her behaviour. A 30-year-old yoga teacher in Mumbai, Alisha seems like an otherwise likable and pleasant human being, and the film dwells closely on how conflicted she is. “She feels like she’s been with this one person for so many years. And now, you know, she is at a stage in her life where she feels stuck.”  Given how deeply traditional India’s reverence for marriage and fidelity is, Gehraiyaan represents something of a departure from how Bollywood typically deals with the subject, by treating infidelity as a private matter rather than a social and moral one. “It deals with complex relationships,” says Padukone, “and views these complex characters through a non-judgmental lens. It’s like peeling an onion: there’s so many layers to all of these characters and everything they’re experiencing.” “We’ve always seen characters in Indian films as very black and white,” she adds. “Maybe a couple are together and one realises that their soulmate is outside of this. But that’s not always the case; sometimes people just drift. They want different things for their life. And I think the way we view them in this movie is a little more grey. By the end of it, you feel that everyone has a story, everyone has a journey that is far more complex and deeper.” “Infidelity is not a new topic in Hindi cinema,” says Anupama Chopra, editor of the website Film Companion, “but the treatment has changed vastly in the last 10 to 15 years.” Of films that tackled the issue in the recent past, probably the best known is Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (Never Say Goodbye) from 2006. Starring a galaxy of big names, including Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Preity Zinta and Abhishek Bachchan, its writer and director Karan Johar set the movie in New York, making it more a parodic tale of overly westernised Indians than an exploration of human desire. “I remember Karan Johar telling me that he couldn’t actually show the actors in a hotel room together,” says Chopra. “We see them walking into the hotel, but we don’t see them in the room. There were these boundaries that you couldn’t cross because Shah Rukh and Rani were such massive stars.” On the whole, the theme has been “not very popular”, says Chopra. “Cinema was very invested in the idea of the wholesome Indian film heroine, who is presumably a virgin until she gets married and then stays in the marriage and lives happily ever after. Those films prescribed a notion of epic love that could not deal with infidelity. Writers and film-makers didn’t know how to make it into mainstream commercial cinema that would be palatable to audiences who they assumed were very conservative.” Gehraiyaan marks a radical shift, not least because its star, Padukone, says Chopra, “is a massive A-lister, and these very limited ideas of what actors can or can’t be on screen are clearly now becoming outdated”. It’s also revolutionary for exploring the female motivation for straying, rather than abiding by the nudge-nudge, wink-wink humour that usually accompanies the portrayal of male infidelity. “The whole idea that it’s fine, boys will be boys,” says Chopra. Female infidelity, on the other hand, “has always been seen as a graver error of judgment than a man having an affair.” While largely ignored by Bollywood, “complexity in relationships goes back to Adam and Eve. It’s not a concept that we do not understand or aren’t aware of,” says Gehraiyaan’s director, Shakun Batra. “It’s a more modern take on infidelity and relationships. Intimacy is something we shied away from in the past. I wanted to make sure we did it in a new way. I like to believe that there is an audience for a more mature story today.” He knows his film is taking a risk. “Thankfully, the movie is on Amazon,” he says. “There is no box office collection.” Gehraiyaan certainly achieves an on-screen intensity between its protagonist Alisha and her lover that is rare in mainstream Indian cinema. “We had an intimacy coordinator on-set,” says Padukone. “I don’t think any Indian film has had that before. We knew exactly what we were getting into. The boundaries had been explored, and we knew who was comfortable with what … It was an extremely safe and comfortable environment to work in. And when it’s true to the story, that in itself makes the actor feel comfortable.” Batra says the film is not pro- or anti-monogamy, but it would be hypocritical to ignore the complexities of relationships. “We often couch the story of infidelity as the search for the soulmate or the search for the one,” says Batra, “and I felt it was time to try to tell a more authentic, more nuanced story, without taking sides or making any judgments. The idea is to provide a space to observe a relationship and be able to ask ourselves what we think of these things.”  Gehraiyaan is released on 11 February on Amazon Prime Video.",Arts/Film,Bollywood’s new affair: the film bringing complexity to screen infidelity,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/09/bollywood-complexity-to-screen-infidelity-gehraiyaan-amazon-prime
2/9/2022,"The mayor of London has signalled he is prepared to try and oust the Metropolitan police commissioner in days or weeks over a series of scandals. Sadiq Khan said he was “disgusted and angry” by recent failings and that he thought Cressida Dick lacked a plan to boost confidence in the police force which had been “knocked and shattered”.  Last week Khan said the commissioner was “on notice” after details emerged of messages shared among a group of 14 officers at Charing Cross police station between 2016 and 2018. Khan and Dick met last week for a 90-minute discussion which left the mayor unsatisfied. On Wednesday Khan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he wanted action soon from Dick and also signalled that his trust and confidence in her leadership of Britain’s biggest force was under serious strain. Khan said: “I have been quite clear to the commissioner: my expectation is the next time I see her I want to see what her response is to the examples not of one officer, of 14 officers being involved in racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, antisemitic, Islamophobic and the like behaviour, nine of whom are still serving. “Secondly, what her plans are to win back the trust and confidence that’s been both been knocked and shattered as a consequence.” Asked if Dick still had his trust, Khan said: “That will be contingent upon the response from the commissioner the next time I see her.” Khan said: “If it is the case that I no longer have trust and confidence in anybody who works for me, I’ll make that quite clear and take action.” Khan said the two big questions for Dick to answer urgently were about the culture of the Met that fostered a series of scandals and what the plan is for winning back the trust and confidence of the public. Other scandals include two officers taking photos at the scene where two sisters lay murdered in a London park, and the Met leadership’s mishandling of the case of Sarah Everard, who was kidnapped, raped and murdered by a serving police officer. Khan said inquiries announced by the Met and the home secretary could take too long, and urgent action was needed. Lack of confidence, Khan said, could deter people coming forward as victims and witnesses. Khan is the police and crime commissioner for London. But Dick is appointed by the home secretary, who has to show due regard for the views of the London mayor. It is thought, but not written down in legislation, that if the London mayor made it clear the Met commissioner no longer enjoyed their confidence, the commissioner would be likely to resign. The Guardian understands the Home Office shares Khan’s concerns about the Met but so far has been less vocal about any desire to oust her, just months after her contract was extended by two years. The most recent precedent is in 2008 when the then Met commissioner, Ian Blair, resigned after losing the support of the then London mayor, Boris Johnson. Khan said his anger over the Charing Cross scandal was intensified by the fact so many investigated over the messages remain as police officers. “I think Londoners can’t understand why nine of these 14 officers are still serving.” One who had a misconduct findings against them was promoted to sergeant, the Guardian revealed last week, another who had no discipline finding against them was also promoted. Khan said the scandals reminded him of horrifying police practices in the 1970s and 1980s. “It was unacceptable then, but it is definitely unacceptable now,” he said. A Charing Cross investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct revealed messages about the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust, prompting accusations of a culture of misogyny and racism. The IOPC stressed the incident was not isolated.",News/UK news,Sadiq Khan warns Cressida Dick has days or weeks to act on Met failings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/sadiq-khan-warns-cressida-dick-days-weeks-act-met-failings
2/9/2022,"Speaking of compelling Super Bowl LVI angles, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford finds himself in the big game just one year after he asked the Detroit Lions, who won their last NFL championship nine years before there even was a Super Bowl, to trade him. As he pointed out Monday, though, “Just because I came here doesn’t mean we were going to get to this point.”  For one, several teams were interested in obtaining Stafford, who had thrown for more than 45,000 yards and 282 touchdowns in 12 tough seasons in Detroit – but had not won a playoff game because his teammates not nicknamed “Megatron” were not so good. (“Megatron” would be Calvin Johnson, the Hall of Fame wide receiver.) Sheila Ford Hamp, the Lions’ principal owner, was not so sure she wanted to get rid of Stafford either, considering that she’d sacked the general manager and coach two months earlier. She said she was a “huge Matthew fan.” So were the team and their long-suffering fans. Stafford, selected with the No 1 overall pick in 2009, the year after the Lions finished 0-16, was no fresh talent – no guaranteed success in LA. He’d played every game over eight full seasons, often hurt, but missed the second half of the 2019 season with fractured bones in his back. Besides, the Lions were not going to just give him away. But the Rams offered a bounty in return: Jared Goff, their 27-year-old starting quarterback, plus, of larger importance, first-round draft choices in 2022 and 2023 and a third-round draft choice in 2021. Hamp OK’d the deal because, as she told the Detroit Free Press in October: “We want people to be here that want to be here and that want to play for us.” She understood why Stafford did not want to start over with another head coach. She saw everyone could benefit. Stafford had two years left on his contract, and he has acknowledged that the Lions could have said, Tough luck, pal. You are in this with the rest of us. The Lions might not win many games, but they made the deal, and for more than football reasons. “I mean, I think we’re in two different phases, and I think that’s what he had recognized,” the Lions’ new general manager, Brad Holmes, said at the Senior Bowl last week, referring to the Lions and Stafford. “I respected his request, and we did the best thing for our organization, the best thing for him.” Stafford grew up in Dallas and went to the University of Georgia, where he met his wife, Kelly. But Detroit became a special place for the Staffords. All four of their daughters were born there. Kelly had surgery there in 2019 to remove a brain tumor. He became involved with the community, participating in charities, becoming a voice. “His stand over the summer during the George Floyd protests revealed a man who’s fully morphed from taking things seriously to doing things seriously,” Mitch Albom, the Detroit Free Press sports columnist, wrote after Stafford asked to be traded. The Lions went winless in their first 11 games under Dan Campbell, the new coach, but Goff played much better at the end of the season, winning three of his last four starts. They have two first-round picks in 2022, the No 2 overall pick and either the No 31 or No 32 pick – and two more first-round picks in 2023. They can say they have benefited from trading Stafford. “All we can do is stay in the present, for where we’re at right now,” Holmes said. “The Rams, congrats to them. It’s an accomplishment to host a big game in their own city. But the present is the reality, and they’re headed to the Super Bowl, and we’re coaching the Senior Bowl,” an all-star game for top college prospects. The Rams don’t offer the cuddly appeal of their Super Bowl opponents, the Cincinnati Bengals, who almost magically have rocketed from a 2-14 finish two years ago to make their first Super Bowl appearance in 33 years under their cool 25-year-old QB, Joe Burrow. The “Who Dey?” Bengals have a 38-year-old head coach, Zac Taylor, who had to get a vote of confidence a year ago from Mike Brown, the owner, after a 4-11-1 season. Meanwhile, the Rams’ 36-year-old head coach, Sean McVay, is in his second Super Bowl in four seasons. The Rams will also be playing in their own stadium. No wonder they are a four-point favorite. There have been hiccups this season. The Rams won seven of their first eight games, but they lost three in a row in November. They then won five games in a row, but lost to the San Francisco 49ers for the second time this season in their finale. But the Rams have won three playoff games – the first playoff victories of Stafford’s career – including a victory in the NFC Championship Game over the 49ers. The mid-season additions of veteran linebacker Von Miller and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr have helped. Of the Detroit fans, Stafford said on Monday that he would “always have a soft spot in my heart and will appreciate them.” He seemed to be aware that many people in Detroit are rooting for the Rams to win the Super Bowl because he plays for them. He appreciates that. “I think we all are playing for not only the guys in this locker room, but those who helped us get to this position,” Stafford. “There’s so many people in Detroit, important people in my life, that have helped me get here.” Campbell understands why Stafford asked for a trade, adding that there are no hard feelings. The Lions will have to rebuild again, this time without Stafford, for their first Super Bowl appearance. But they granted him the opportunity to try something new, because they knew he’d benefit, too.

2/9/2022,"Who should be famous? There are people who are so brilliant at – and dedicated to – what they do that their work makes the world seem bigger and more exciting. Watching them act, hearing them sing, reading their writing or seeing their art can make you feel like something inside you is waking up – like there is more to life than work, bills and shopping. It really hits you. There are people who live wild, fascinating lives, full of stories that remind you rules can be broken. There are people who are so beautiful they seem to come from a different planet. You see a face like this and it stays with you. You find yourself, months later, in a supermarket queue, smiling and wondering about them, still. There are people who are very brave. Who will do the right thing, whatever the personal cost, because someone has to.  Then there are influencers. The typical mainstream influencer is conventionally attractive but unexceptional. They are accessible. They painstakingly document the minutiae of their lives: a parade of nights in; Tupperware lunches; cups of tea (herbal after 5); cocktails in chain bars; Ikea trips; gym outings; worthy non-fiction books; bland clothes from high street brands (they know fast fashion is bad, don’t worry); and their political views – corporate-brochure style progressivism. They are safe and unchallenging, a symptom of a risk-averse culture. As Natasha Stagg writes in Sleeveless: “A typical influencer today is basic – the opposite of avant garde.” They are famous because they want to be. And often thanks to a deeply random origin story – appearing on a homepage, buying followers, being tagged by a bigger influencer, accidentally going viral – or via their participation in reality TV. Mainstream influencers revel in their ordinariness. The larger their following, the more ordinary they tend to be. The biggest TikTok-er is Charli D’Amelio (135.8 million followers), a perfectly average suburban teenager whose skill is tap dancing. For a while her bio was a self-deprecating joke: “Don’t worry, I don’t get the hype either.” Social media has democratised fame and elevated banality. My sense is that this banality has driven the demand that influencers conform to a narrow definition of a “good person”. A squeaky-clean type with brand-friendly progressive views, who lists their privileges and performs plainly superficial gestures, such as the trend for white people “confessing” to whiteness (a characteristic that is usually obvious). If a famous person is unexceptional, the subject of their morality becomes more salient because it poses an uncomfortable question: why do they deserve their fame? Earlier this year, Molly-Mae Hague, an influencer who gained prominence as a contestant on Love Island, attracted ire for an interview where she said: “We all have the same 24 hours in a day … If you want something enough, you can achieve it.” This was interpreted as a shocking revelation of her Thatcherite worldview. Particularly stark since she serves as creative director of Pretty Little Thing, a brand that got bad publicity over paying workers in Leicester £3.50 an hour. The vehemence of the response was striking. It seemed overstated, or mistimed. Hague’s position at PLT predated this – and the wages were national news in 2020. You don’t need great powers of deduction to discern that Hague’s politics would not align with a union rep’s. Was the issue her views? Or that she didn’t conform to what was expected of her as an influencer? If she had woodenly listed her privileges and self-castigated, while remaining at PLT, what difference would that have made? While Hague’s media storm raged, I was subjected to a concerted advertising campaign by Uber, using a YouTube influencer named Lucy Moon. “Safety Matters with Lucy Moon,” went the tagline: “I love exploring the city. But as a woman, I also want to feel safe.” Footage showed Moon sipping cocktails and zipping around in a taxi. Uber has been beleaguered by issues linked to low driver pay, as Polly Smythe documented, and by safety concerns. This advert seemed like Uber’s attempt to mitigate these issues. I imagine I saw so much of it because it was targeted at young women. This is not the most sinister (or canny) marketing strategy. But the influencer partnership struck me. Moon’s social media brand is familiar: a beige array of cardigans, teas and stock privilege disclaimers. In posts from summer 2020, when the outcry over George Floyd’s murder made disavowing racism a brand imperative, Moon (who is white) exhorted followers to be better allies and advertised her own credentials by announcing that she was now reading Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race. When I watched her Instagram story, it was a video explaining colonialism. This self-conscious progressivism, performed while in partnership with a company that had to be forced by the UK supreme court to recognise workers’ rights, seems like galling hypocrisy. But I’m not sure it’s that; I think it’s mindlessness. The natural outcome of a politics that is proudly proclaimed when it is of personal benefit but totally unconsidered. Is this posturing better than what Hague said? Or worse? Moon looks like just one example of the cynical and deeply unserious way that social justice operates among influencers: as a branding device. Melodramatic language (phrases like “taking a stand”) disguises the fact that what counts as activism on social media is inherently low-effort and low-cost. Even under these conditions, influencers are spineless. They frantically espouse support for causes that have mainstream buy-in and ignore controversial ones. The anti-racism black square in 2020, for example, was ubiquitous. Expressing views on Palestine is rare. Inconsistencies abound. Rejecting colonialism is common, but there was silence last month on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, when British soldiers shot dead 13 people at a march for civil rights in Derry. The regular instances when a smear campaign (posing as a social justice crusade) is used to attract followers and advertise righteousness never involve personal risk. The recent West Elm Caleb saga was so corporate-brochure friendly that a mayonnaise conglomerate was involved within hours. It’s all just fake and silly. None of this would matter if this progressivism was not being used to sell us something. Not just Uber or mayonnaise. But these people. These bland, ordinary figures. These symptoms of a culture that is forgetting the value of beauty, weirdness and coolness. Of people who are brave. Of people who are very good at something that matters. Of feeling like something inside you is waking up. A culture that is so risk-averse it has stupefied itself.

2/9/2022,"GSK made £1.4bn from Covid-related medicines last year, beating forecasts in its first financial results since rejecting Unilever’s £50bn buyout offer in December, as chief executive Emma Walmsley pledged a “step-change in growth” in a landmark year. The company is under the spotlight after promising to raise billions by spinning out its consumer arm, whose brands include Nicorette, Panadol and Aquafresh, in a London stock market listing this summer.  GSK reported total sales of £34bn for 2021, in line with last year. The consumer healthcare business contributed £9.6bn, down 4% from 2020. GSK’s annual profit before tax fell to £5.1bn, from £6.4bn in 2020. In the final quarter of the year, turnover rose 9% to £9.5bn, slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts, while earnings per share were also better than expected at 25.6p. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs described the results as “solid”. GSK’s biggest Covid treatment was Xevudy (sotrovimab), an injected antibody treatment approved by the UK drugs watchdog in early December. Trials found it cut the likelihood of hospital admission and death by 79% in people with mild to moderate Covid-19 who are at high risk of developing severe disease. It was found to be effective against the Omicron variant. The drug brought in £958m of sales while GSK’s pandemic adjuvant, a formula added to Covid vaccines developed by others to make them more effective, generated sales of £447m. Walmsley said: “This is going to be a landmark year for GSK, with a step-change in growth expected and multiple research and development catalysts, including milestones on up to seven key late-stage pipeline assets. 2022 is also the year when we demerge our world-leading consumer healthcare business.” She said GSK would set out the future growth ambitions and financial profile of the consumer business at an investor event on 28 February. The remaining pharmaceuticals and vaccines business, called New GSK, is expected to deliver sales growth of 5%-7% at constant exchange rates this year, compared with 5% growth last year for the whole group. Walmsley is under pressure from the activist investor Elliott Management, a New York hedge fund, which is clamouring for change along with the much smaller London-based Bluebell Capital Partners. Both have pushed for a sale of the consumer business. GSK recently rejected three offers from Unilever as too low, the last of which was worth £50bn, and Unilever walked away. Elliott and Bluebell have also demanded that Walmsley reapply for her job after the company’s split, but she has insisted that she will continue to lead the drugmaker. GSK’s vaccines sales dropped 10% to £1.8bn last year, as countries’ normal vaccination programmes were disrupted by the Covid-19 vaccination drive, hitting sales of the drugmaker’s shingles and meningitis jabs.",News/Business,Boost for GSK as it reports earnings at £1.4bn in Covid-related sales,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/boost-for-gsk-as-it-reports-earnings-at-14bn-in-covid-related-sales
