12/24/2021,"A TikToker has sparked debate on the platform after sharing an Applebee’s receipt exposing a customer’s substandard tip. The user @kingj24__ posted footage of a receipt from a franchise location in Staten Island, N.Y., showing a $6.55 tip left for a server named Dana G. The total bill plus the tip is $80, meaning the cost of the meal was $73.45. The tip comes out to around 9% of the bill. That’s significantly less than the standard 20% tip, which would have been $13.49 in this instance.  Look your best this holiday season with top fashion items from Walmart: It is unclear if the TikToker who shared the receipt is the server in question. The customer also left a hand-written message on the receipt explaining the low tip.  “You [were] great,” they wrote. “Holidays are just rough right now.” They added in an arrow pointing to the tip and a frowning face.  TikTokers were divided in the comments of the video, which has since racked up over 711,000 views. Some pointed out that the customer, who seemed to be going through some financial struggle, did at least leave a tip, albeit a small one. ""It's only $4.45 less than the typical 15% average tip,"" one user commented. ""But at the same time, you don't know that family's struggle. [At] least they left you a tip."" ""The nerve of some of y'all,"" wrote another. ""Gatekeeping taking your family out to dinner for the financially blessed. What type of BS is 'stay home if you're broke.'"" ""This makes me really not want to go to Applebee's,"" commented a third. ""It's a low tip, but it's still a tip. Calling out customers like this is wrong."" Still, others believed that the customer shouldn't be dining out if they cannot tip fully, as waiters rely on their tips as a primary source of income. ""You can afford $73 and some change to feed yourself but not enough to tip?"" commented one person. ""Don’t eat out if you can’t afford the service. ""If I can't afford a 20% tip, then [I'm] not going out for an $80 meal,"" wrote another. Some TikTokers turned the conversation around, noting that restaurants should be fairly compensating their employees so they do not have to live off of tips. “Ban tipping,” one user wrote. “Force the restaurants to pay servers living wages.” “Don’t blame the tipper, blame the establishment,” wrote another. “These people shouldn’t have to rely on tips to barely make ends meet.” The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.  However, as trial attorney Laura Lawless explains for The National Law Review, businesses that employ tipped workers are legally allowed to pay them as little as $2.13 per hour, though the number varies by state. This is because employers can take a “tip credit” of up to $5.12 per hour against the $7.25 federal minimum wage obligation — meaning that as long as an employee’s hourly wage plus their tips equals $7.25 an hour or over, the low wage is considered legal. According to tax and auditing firm Plante Moran, tip credits are meant to “give some relief to businesses that pay an employer’s share of employment taxes on tip income paid to their employees by someone else.” But Lawless notes that the long-standing tip credit model “presumes that tipped employees receive a steady flow of tips and spend nearly all of their working hours engaged in tip-generating labor,” which does not “always align with reality.” Many tipped employees, for instance, might be tasked with time-consuming duties for which they are not tipped, such as bookkeeping and cleaning, while receiving just $2.13 an hour for such labor. On Oct. 28, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the “Final Rule,” which will require employers to pay the full federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour to tipped workers who spend more than 20% of the workweek on tasks not directly engaged in tip-producing work.  The rule will go into effect on Dec. 28.

12/24/2021,"Picture this: A special operations team has set up an observation post on a rocky hillside in enemy territory. The team’s mission: provide surveillance of the terrorists planning an attack from their camp below, and then target the commander once preparations have reached their peak. Down in the camp, the commander is confident the valley above is free of danger. There’s little cover, and he’s outfitted his sentries with night-vision goggles that would light up with the heat signature of any threats. The special ops troops have covered themselves with camouflage that not only blends in with the rock-strewn hillside, but hides their telltale heat. The team is difficult to see during the daytime, but impossible to spot at night. Before the attack is set to commence, the commander calls his fighters before him. As he begins to speak, a pair of crosshairs a half-mile away drifts over his silhouette. The sniper exhales and gently squeezes the trigger. This scenario could become possible thanks to a new camouflage material, Kit 300, developed by Israeli defense contractor Polaris Solutions. Kit 300 is a “thermal visual concealment”—essentially a sheet that uses advanced materials to block a soldier’s body heat. This renders them invisible to night-vision sensors, which in recent decades have become available to terrorist groups. The first American night-vision device, the M3 Infrared, debuted in the final days of World War II. Early gadgets typically paired an infrared spotlight with an image amplifier. The infrared light was invisible to the naked eye, but would illuminate a target for the image amplifier. Later scopes did away with the infrared light source entirely, instead amplifying ambient light, particularly moonlight. In the 1980s, thermal imagers heralded a revolution in night-fighting capability. By detecting small differences in heat in their field of view, thermal imagers show a person as defined by their radiated body heat, with the hands, face, and other exposed body parts shining brightly. A tank fighting at night would be seen via its engine panels. Through the 1990s, thermal imagers used to confer a huge edge on the armies of the countries who had the technology. But as the tech advanced, it became easier to acquire. After the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, Israel complained that night vision sold by Britain and Italy to Iran to stem the flow of drugs was discovered in the possession of the terrorist group. By 2017, Iran was reportedly manufacturing thermal imagers of its own. In 2018, when the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, accused Russia of giving aid to the Taliban, senior Afghan police officers and military figures said night- vision goggles were part of the gear that Russia supplied. Kit 300 camouflage could give NATO and its allies their nighttime advantage back. Polaris is tight-lipped about exactly what goes into the Kit 300 sheet, stating only that it consists of “microfibres, metals, and polymers.” The foil-like material can be formed into rock-shaped structures for soldiers to hide behind. A large sheet of the material can hide vehicles as large as a Hummer. Roughly the size of a twin bedsheet, a Kit 300 sheet weighs around one pound and compresses into a small roll. It’s also strong enough to be used as a litter to carry injured soldiers. Plus, the sheet is reportedly waterproof and has been tested in rain and high heat. While armies with thermal-imaging devices once held a trump card over their enemies, they must continue to develop countermeasures of their own to survive. Devices like the Kit 300 will allow soldiers to once again disappear. Camouflage Uniforms: For centuries, armies used brightly colored uniforms to control troops, allowing leaders to organize their infantry into tightly packed columns that delivered volleys of firepower. By World War I, as small arms improved, armies sought more subdued uniforms and began experimenting with darker patterns (brown, khaki) to blend in with the dirt of trench warfare. By WWII, U.S. troops in the Pacific wore camouflage patterns to blend in with jungle vegetation. Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP): In 2015, the U.S. Army abandoned the pixelated grays and whites of the Universal Camouflage Pattern in favor of a new scheme. Scorpion W2, developed by the Army’s Natick Soldier Systems Center, was a return to the dashes and flashes of subdued colors of previous army camouflage. In 2021, Scorpion, or Operational Camouflage Pattern, became the official duty uniform of the Army, Air Force, and Space Force. Ghillie Suits: In the 19th century, Scottish gamekeepers constructed these loose suits of dyed strips of fabrics to blend in with their surroundings and catch poachers. Lovat Scouts, the first snipers employed by the British Army, adopted and used the suits during the Boer War. The shaggy, dark suits break up the wearer’s profile to remain undetected. Today’s U.S. Army snipers use specialized suits called the Improved Ghillie System that consist of sleeves, leggings, veil, and a cape.
