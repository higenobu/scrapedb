2/15/2022,"PayPal (PYPL) investors might want to skip this first paragraph. Barely six weeks into 2022, and the shares have already shed 39% of their value, accelerating a slide which began midway through last year. While the volatile environment hasn’t helped, the company’s latest earnings displays can shoulder most of the blame for the share price meltdown. And following a particularly disappointing outlook in the wake of Q4’s result’s, the stock delivered its worst daily performance ever. Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Keane is not surprised that investor confidence is low. “Over the last two earnings reports, PYPL has taken down forward guidance with many investors wondering if the updated forward guidance is finally achievable,” the 5-star analyst explained. That said, PYPL slashed its forecast for net new active accounts (NNAs) on the latest earnings report yet did not alter its long-term outlook for 2023-2035. As such, Keane wonders if the shortfall in accounts can be negated by share gains, engagement and increasing average revenue per user (ARPU). So, can they? Based on Keane’s market share analysis, PayPal has “continued to gain share” and the 5-star analyst sees potential for growth to “remain elevated” given the ongoing share gains through PayPal’s “full suite of solutions and strategy to move up the sales funnel.” Additionally, beyond the physical goods and travel/events eComm market, PayPal’s penetration rate remains low and still offers a “large opportunity.” As for engagement, while net adds are anticipated to revert to pre-pandemic levels in FY23 and beyond, moving forward, PYPL expects engagement to “increase” from current levels. Lastly, the roll out of the new super app and suite of products/services as well as the “purging of unprofitable accounts,” should prove beneficial to both engagement and ARPU. Which all means Keane stays bullish, sticking with a Buy rating and $200 price target. Investors stand to take home about 75% gain, should the target be met over the next 12 months. (To watch Keane’s track record, click here) What does the rest of the Street make of PYPL’s prospects? Based on 27 Buys, 9 Holds and 1 Sell, the analysts’ view is that this stock is a Moderate Buy. The forecast calls for 12-month gains of ~63%, given the average price target clocks in at $186.24.

2/15/2022,"Once the bell rings on Wednesday (Feb 16), Nvidia (NVDA) will take its turn to deliver the January quarter (F4Q22) results. The chip giant’s latest earnings come at an almost unprecedented period for the company - and stock – in recent times. The shares have suffered at the hands of 2022’s extremely volatile environment and sit 18% into the red year-to-date. This is a rather unusual sight. Yet, looking ahead to the print, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann expects something more familiar, anticipating the results will beat the consensus estimates once again. That said, the upside might be capped this time around. “We see the January quarter being driven by strength in all end-markets, with Data Center and Gaming as the standouts,” the 5-star analyst said, before adding, “We believe constraints in supply, broadly speaking, will be a factor that limits near-term upside.” Looking ahead to the April guide, Mosesmann expects the company’s outlook will also exceed expectations. The analyst sees the company guiding above the Street’s revenue forecast of a low-single-digit quarter-over-quarter decline. Robust data center sales, vigorous AI and cloud computing verticals, growing ray tracing adoption, and continued momentum in the Automotive segment should all play their part. As for what to keep an eye out for on the earnings call, Mosesmann will be looking for more color on the Omniverse, details on how the 3-product strategy is progressing, comments regarding the anticipated length of the supply chain shortages and the consequences of the Arm deal’s collapse. All in all, Nvidia remains one of Mosesmann’s “favorite secular semiconductor plays,” and the analyst sees a number of “growth vectors” coming into play – including the Omniverse, next generation networking/ DPU adoption and autonomous driving. As such, the analyst sticks with a Buy rating and a Street-high price target of $400. Should his thesis play out, a potential upside of ~65% could be in the cards. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, click here) Barring two skeptics, the rest of Wall Street’s analyst corps agree here; with an additional 22 Buys, the stock qualifies with a Strong Buy consensus rating. There’s decent upside projected too; going by the $355.68 average target, shares will climb by 47% over the one-year period.

2/15/2022,"At long last, following a year of Covid delays, Sensonics (SENS) received the FDA’s nod of approval for its long-lasting continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM). The Diabetes device maker’s Eversense E3 (180-Day sensor) has now been given the go ahead and should be available to patients in the U.S. via Ascensia Diabetes Care, the company’s worldwide commercial partner, starting in 2Q22. Despite the approval’s delay – mainly on account of backlogs at the FDA and in-line 2021 results - the lone catalyst single-handedly pushed the shares up by 218% in 2021. While Raymond James’ Jayson Bedford calls the approval an “important milestone” for the company, he also believes it was “well anticipated.” In fact, the analyst thinks the shares’ valuation is out of whack, even following the 'sell the news' selloff (down by 42% in the subsequent sessions). “We still view SENS as one of the most dislocated stocks in our universe, as estimates are trending lower, and the valuation, in our view, is unsustainable,” the 5-star analyst said. “We respect management, and acknowledge that the Eversense technology is differentiated, but expectations, in our view, are too high.” The analyst also thinks the company’s 2022 revenue guidance of $14-18 million - the Street had expected $31 million - seems “somewhat meager given the anticipated marketing push from Ascensia.” With the big catalyst having played out, there are only “smaller catalysts” to look forward to in 1H22 and the stock’s success hinges on executing on the commercial front. While 2Q should also see E3’s European approval, the company’s gen-1 180-sensor has already been on the market in the region for the past four years. As such, Bedford gives Sensonics shares an Underperform (i.e. Sell) rating. (To watch Bedford’s track record, click here) Looking at the reviews breakdown, there is little consent here amongst the analysts. The stock’s Hold consensus rating is based on 1 Buy, Hold and Sell, each. At $1.90, the average price target implies ~10% downside from the current share price of $2.11.
