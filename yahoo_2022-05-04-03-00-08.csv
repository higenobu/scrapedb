5/4/2022,"A waitress has sparked an animated discussion after airing her biggest on-the-job pet peeves. For almost a year, a 24-year-old TikToker, Lizzy Smith (@c0_0l__) has used the app to chronicle her experiences in the service industry. Her most popular videos give insight into the customer behavior that annoys wait staff the most. What is inflation and what causes it? TikTok is full of content from service industry workers, who often raise issues that others may not be aware of. Starbucks baristas have shared their wildest drink orders, including one that was literally too big for the blender. Restaurant workers have been sharing their daily earnings at places like Waffle House and Hooters. One of Smith’s most popular clips shows the waitress reenacting her biggest pet peeves in real time. Her first issue? When customers cut her off before she can introduce herself. Next, Smith shows what it feels like when she arrives at a table with an order, and no one speaks up to claim it. Both problems resonated deeply with both service workers and customers. The video sparked a major discussion about the responsibilities of the servers — and of the customers. “I’m a food runner and too many ppl just stare at you like you’re crazy when I bring their food,” one user wrote. “When you’re standing there holding two VERY hot plates and there just like staring while you’re asking then who ordered what or like they just ignore,” another agreed. Check out our men's beach and swimwear summer style guide: “Why is it so hard to be a decent person? My friend and I never cut off our server,” another wrote. Some customers, meanwhile, pushed back, wondering why they should be the ones to claim their own food. “Isn’t it literally your responsibility to know who ordered what,” one user commented. “Where I work, I’m taught to get the order in a certain order so I can remember,” another added. Many commenters pushed back against that, wondering why it was an issue to speak up. “Can’t believe y’all are mad about ‘pawning,'” one user argued. “Oh no, your eating experience is ruined because you have to say ‘me’ real quick before you eat.” As is often the case, the debate veered into a discussion of tipping culture in the United States. This has been a hot topic on TikTok lately, thanks to viral videos featuring customers trying to tip with Amazon gift cards and asking for their waitress’s number, after tipping $0.

5/4/2022,"An Alabama corrections official who vanished with an inmate facing capital murder charges “may have been brainwashed” into helping him escape, her mother-in-law said Tuesday. The pair could be anywhere by now, Frances White told The Daily Beast, explaining that Lauderdale County Assistant Director of Corrections Vicky Sue White, 56, was frugal and had amassed enough money to keep her afloat for some time. “She had said that she’d like to live in Florida, that’s the only thing I can think of,” Frances White, 88, said in a phone interview Tuesday morning. As the search for Vicky White and 38-year-old Casey Cole White (no relation) stretches into its fifth day, her late husband’s family doesn’t know what to think. Frances White said her son, Thomas White, died in January from complications related to Parkinson’s disease. “I’m just proud he wasn’t still alive, cause he still thought she was a good person,” she said. “I can’t imagine her running off with that guy, but you never know. He walked into a woman’s house and stabbed her.” Inmate Charged with Capital Murder Disappears with Corrections Officer of 25 Years Casey White was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail after confessing to stabbing 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway to death in 2015. The six-foot-nine White, who pleaded not guilty to killing Ridgeway, had already been sentenced in 2019 to 75 years for a crime spree in Limestone County that same year for attempting to gun down his ex-girlfriend, stealing an SUV, shooting and killing a dog, and taking three hostages. “He stated that he wanted to kill her and have the police kill him,” said a police report from the case. “His only regret was that neither was successful. He stated that if he was released he would kill the victim.” Vicky White, who had an “unblemished record,” according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton, was last seen on April 29, leaving the county jail with Casey White to take him to court for a mental health evaluation. Casey White was handcuffed and shackled in the back of her patrol car, said Singleton. But Vicky White had committed a serious breach of protocol by transporting Casey White solo, contravening a policy put in place to have two sworn deputies with him during any movements following the discovery in 2020 of an escape plan he was allegedly concocting. Vicky White said she was headed to a doctor’s appointment after dropping Casey White off. However, Singleton said Casey White did not have an evaluation scheduled for that day, and Vicky White never showed up at the medical facility. Her patrol car was later found abandoned in the parking lot of a nearby shopping center. After first saying that investigators were looking into whether Vicky White willingly helped Casey White escape, or if she had been threatened or coerced into it, Singleton said Monday that “indications are” that she was in on it. A press release issued Tuesday by the Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Department said there had been a “special relationship between Director White and inmate Casey White. That relationship has now been confirmed through our investigation by independent sources and means.” On Tuesday, Frances White was still racking her brain trying to make sense of what happened. “Everybody’s trying to figure out what made her do it,” she told The Daily Beast. “Somebody said, ‘Maybe she was just having a bad day.’ I said, ‘Well, that’s not an excuse.’” The two had six hours to get away, White continued, “So, they’re not around here.” “I don’t have any idea where she is,” she said, noting that her former daughter-in-law had spoken about eventually retiring to Florida. Vicky White had just submitted her retirement papers the day before she disappeared, and her mom told local news outlet WAAY that nothing seemed out of the ordinary on their last morning together. About five weeks ago, she sold the home she had shared with her late husband and moved in with her mother. News reports described Vicky as flush with cash from the sale, but Frances White said she spent years socking away cash and would have plenty of it on hand. “She had money before she sold her home,” Frances White told The Daily Beast. “She saved her money. I figure if she’s still got her money, she’s still got enough to live on for a while.” Casey White faces the death penalty if convicted of Ridgeway’s murder. He “doesn’t have anything to lose, she’s got everything to lose,” said Frances White, who added, “I don’t think that man’s got any feelings for anybody.” In the aftermath of Friday’s escape, Ridgeway’s son, Austin Williams, called Casey White a “monster.” Vicky White was armed at the time, and Singleton said Casey White should now be considered armed and dangerous. An arrest warrant for Vicky White, a copy of which was obtained by The Daily Beast, has been issued on charges of permitting or aiding escape in the first degree. Casey White is wanted on one count of second-degree escape. A $10,000 reward has been offered for information leading to their capture. The case brings to mind another infamous jailbreak carried out with the assistance of a female prison employee. Joyce Mitchell, a prison seamstress, spent more than four years behind bars for helping two inmates break out of the maximum-security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, in 2015. Mitchell, who had been having an affair with one of the men, was released in 2020. Frances White’s two surviving sons are in just as much shock as her, she said: “They can’t believe it either. My oldest son, no way could he picture her leaving with him… It looks like she helped him escape.” Everybody in the family is hoping someone will come forward with a lead, she said. “You know, there’s a $10,000 reward out, and somebody will tell them something,” she said. “I thought if she had talked to anybody, maybe they would come forward to get that money… Maybe he’s got her brainwashed. But I don't know how he’d have had a chance to get her brainwashed, because he was in prison.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/4/2022,"The judge presiding over Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation lawsuit rejected Amber Heard’s motion to toss out the case. Penny Azcarate said that sufficient evidence had been presented by Depp’s lawyers to keep the case ongoing. More from Deadline How To Watch The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial; Case Resumes Today Johnny Depp's New Movie Will Be On Sale At The Cannes Market, Actor Will Play French King Louis XV Amber Heard Expected To File Motion To Toss Johnny Depp $50M Case; ""Required"" Move Expected To Fail Heard’s motion to strike is almost a formality after plaintiffs’ wrap up their case, and it was expected that Azcarate would reject such an effort. Attorneys for both sides presented oral arguments on the motion on Tuesday morning, without the jury present. For Heard’s legal team, the motion’s primary point is to assure certain appeal rights to the defense if necessary. Depp sued his ex-wife over a 2018 Washington Post op ed headlined, “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.” Heard wrote that “two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out.” Although Depp is not named in the op ed, his attorneys argue that there was enough of a connection to Heard’s 2016 claims that he physically abused her. Azcarate noted that “if there is a scintilla of evidence that a reasonable juror could weigh, then the matter survives a motion to strike.” She said that there was “evidence that jurors could weigh that the statements were about the plaintiff, that the statements were published and that the statement was false, and that the defendant made the statement knowing it to be false or that the defendant made it so recklessly as to amount to willful disregard for the truth. The weight of that evidence is up to the fact finders.” She said that she would not yet rule on whether a defamation claim should survive regarding one of Heard’s tweets. Heard’s team had no comment on the judge’s ruling. Earlier in the morning, Michael Spindler, an economic damages expert, testified that Depp “suffered lost earnings of approximately $40 million” over an almost two year period following the publication of the op ed. That included $20.3 million, after agency commissions, from the loss of playing Jack Sparrow in a Pirates 6, as well as $20.1 million from booking for non franchise films. Under questioning from Heard’s attorney, Spindler acknowledged that he was not offering testimony on whether the loss of earnings was caused by Heard’s op ed. More to come.

5/4/2022,"Speaking to the press alongside other Senate Democrats on Tuesday, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the caucus will hold a vote on legislation that would protect the right to an abortion. CHUCK SCHUMER: Republicans are spending all their focus on the leak because they don't want to focus on ""Roe v Wade,"" where they know they're on the wrong side of history and on the wrong side of the American people. Try as they might, they can't distract from the truth. The blame for this decision falls squarely on Senate Republicans, who spent years pushing extremist judges and justices while claiming this day would never come. But come it has. So in light of this potential ruling, I want to make three things very clear. First, it is our intention for the Senate to hold a vote on legislation to codify the right to an abortion in law. Second, a vote on this legislation is no longer an abstract exercise. This is as urgent and as real as it gets. We will vote to protect a woman's right to choose. And every American is going to see which side every senator stands on. Third, to the American people, I say this. The elections this November will have consequences because the rights of 100 million women are now on the ballot.",Politics/Yahoo News Video,Schumer says Senate Democrats eye vote to codify right to an abortion,https://news.yahoo.com/schumer-says-senate-democrats-intend-173448079.html
