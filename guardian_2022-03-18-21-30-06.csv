3/18/2022,"The owner of Burger King has said the operator of its 800 stores in Russia has “refused” to close them, despite its demand to suspend trading after the invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International (RBI), said it had suspended all supply chain, operational and marketing support for the Russian operation. RBI has been unable to close the operations directly, as rivals such as McDonald’s have done, because of a complicated legal contract with its main franchisee partner, Alexander Kolobov, with whom it has run the joint venture in Russia for a decade. “We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia,” said David Shear, the president of RBI, in a statement and letter to staff. “He has refused to do so. Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No.” Burger King is one of a number of western companies, including Marks & Spencer and the hotel groups Marriott and Accor, that are prevented by complex franchise deals from withdrawing. The company said that it is attempting to sell its 15% stake in the Russian operation. Shear said that any profits from the business, and its ownership stake, have been redirected to the United Nations’ refugee agency (UNHCR). “There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,” he said. “No serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses. This is exactly why we say it’s a complicated legal process.” Burger King’s main franchisee in Russia is Kolobov – the main day-to-day operator of the business – but other partners include Investment Capital Ukraine and VTB Capital, part of the state-owned VTB Bank, Russia’s second-largest bank, which has been subjected to western sanctions. Shears said any attempt to try to force termination at this time would require the support of the Russian authorities. “We know that will not practically happen any time soon,” he said. “This is also why you may see other brands in Russia with similar structures continue to operate in the market.” M&S stores are operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer’s products across eastern Europe since 1999. M&S has suspended all shipments of goods to FiBA, which operates 48 stores in Russia.",News/Business,Burger King owner says operator in Russia refuses to shut shops,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/burger-king-owner-says-operator-in-russia-refuses-to-shut-shops-ukraine
3/18/2022,"Last November, having alerted the world to the new and highly transmissible Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, South Africa-based scientist Tulio de Oliveira saw that country hit with travel bans. Already smarting at what he saw as wealthier nations’ hoarding of vaccines, antiviral drugs and test reagents, his frustration spilled over. “If the world keeps punishing Africa for the discovery of Omicron and ‘global health scientists’ keep taking the data, who will share early data again?” he tweeted. Two years into this pandemic, as the World Health Organization (WHO) mulls the tricky question of when to call it over and some countries, including the UK, pre-empt that decision, the world’s attention is turning to the future. How do we improve our response to the next pandemic? There are two main challenges: improving the surveillance of pathogens; and ensuring vaccine equity. And as De Oliveira intimated, these are linked. Not only morally, but for the first time in pandemic history, legally. It used to be that living organisms, including pathogens, were considered humanity’s common heritage, and sharing them for scientific purposes happened informally. That changed with the UN’s 1992 convention on biological diversity (CBD), which states that countries have sovereign rights over genetic resources found on their territory. Under an annex to that convention, the Nagoya protocol, the host country can set terms for accessing those resources and for ensuring the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from them. Covid-19 is the first pandemic since Nagoya entered into force in 2014, but the spirit of the protocol has not been respected. Starting with China in January 2020, countries have shared Sars-CoV-2-related data freely, demanding nothing in return. That data has driven revolutions in vaccinology, pathogen sequencing and data collection. But the fruits of those revolutions have not been shared equitably. Just 14% of people in low-income countries have received at least one vaccine dose, compared with about 80% in high- and upper middle-income countries. The WHO is now proposing several separate initiatives to improve surveillance, including two Europe-based hubs for the international sharing of pathogen data and samples. But these proposals, too, effectively ignore Nagoya. The WHO expects countries to contribute to the hubs for the common good, possibly even on pain of sanctions. Though it has been vocal about the need for vaccine equity, none of the current proposals explicitly address benefit-sharing. “We’re treating pathogen-sharing as a common good, but we’re not treating vaccines and medical countermeasures as a common good,” sayslegal scholar Mark Eccleston-Turner of King’s College London. Eccleston-Turner says human pathogens should be excluded from Nagoya and vaccines should be similarly reclassified. Practically, he suggests, this might be enshrined in a pandemic treaty the WHO is working on, that could apportion intellectual property (IP) rights according to the ratio of public-private investment in vaccine development. The three or four leading coronavirus vaccines all took a different route to market, but one thing they have in common, according to IP law specialist Luke McDonagh of the London School of Economics, is that the public bore most of the risk and the drug companies maintained most of the IP. More of the IP should stay in the public domain, he says, reflecting taxpayers’ investment. McDonagh points to research showing private-sector claims that reducing their IP dominance would dilute innovation do not hold up, and gives the example of antiretroviral drugs for HIV – the subject of an earlier IP battle. “The fact of generic production in the global south has not affected incentives for HIV research in the rich countries,” he says. But changing the status quo via a new treaty may not be easy without government backing, he admits, and the UK and EU are among those whose current stance on patents suggests they might oppose it. Sharing knowhow and building up vaccine manufacturing capacity globally are also vital for achieving vaccine equity, he says, and the WHO is promoting both. There may be a radically different solution: leave pathogens in Nagoya and respect its insistence on equitable benefit-sharing. There is a precedent, says Edward Hammond, a Texas-based consultant who has advised low- and middle-income countries on the implications of Nagoya. He points to a successful implementation of Nagoya in the WHO’s own pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP) framework. Through PIP, WHO member states share samples of flu viruses that have human pandemic potential, and the WHO receives a share of the benefits. “It has generated over $250m [£190m] in cash payments from vaccine [and other] companies,” Hammond says. Some have said applying Nagoya to pathogens would at best create delays in sharing and at worst give control to bad actors. “In the event of another pandemic, some country might assert its ‘rights’ over virus samples, keeping the rest of the world in the dark,” Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, wrote in a blog post at Stat last November. It is not just drug companies expressing that view. It is shared by some in public health. Three years ago, Vasee Moorthy, a senior science adviser at the WHO, worked on a study into the impact of Nagoya on public health. “Certain people were worried that there might be delays, but we haven’t seen that,” Moorthy says. If anything, the study found that the protocol encourages pathogen-sharing by building trust that benefits will be fairly shared. As Moorthy says: “Sharing is in everyone’s interests.” De Oliveira agrees. With its history of fighting HIV, he says, South Africa would never withhold crucial data whose rapid release it knows could potentially save millions of lives, “but unfortunately not every country has this long-term experience or transparent government and they might withhold”. To avoid that, he says, containment measures including travel bans should be balanced by financial or other support. Nagoya is not perfect, Hammond admits. For one thing, it only covers physical samples, not the digital sequence data that is increasingly all that is needed to make vaccines, tests and drugs – though he and others are lobbying to change that. But it does embrace the spirit of the era, with its accent on reciprocity. It allows for multilateral benefit sharing, as befits a pandemic. It could, he feels, have prevented or at least mitigated vaccine nationalism. And PIP could provide the model for a better instrument that covers many pathogens, including the one that causes the next pandemic.",News/World news,How should the world respond to the next pandemic?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/how-should-world-respond-to-next-pandemic-covid
3/18/2022,"At the 1937 International Exposition in Paris, two colossal pavilions faced each other down. One was Hitler’s Germany, crowned with a Nazi eagle. The other was Stalin’s Soviet Union, crowned with a statue of a worker and a peasant holding hands. It was a symbolic clash at a moment when right and left were fighting to the death in Spain. But somewhere inside the Soviet pavilion, among all the socialist realism, were drawings of fabulous beasts and flowers filled with a raw folkloric magic. They subverted the age of the dictators with nothing less than a triumph of the human imagination over terror and mass death. These sublime creations were the work of a Ukrainian artist, Maria Prymachenko, who has once again become a symbol of survival in the midst of a dictator’s war. Prymachenko, who died in 1997, is the best-loved artist of the besieged country, a national symbol whose work has appeared on its postage stamps, and her likeness on its money. Ukrainian astronomer Klim Churyumov even named a planet after her. When the Museum of Local History in Ivankiv caught fire under Russian bombardment, a Ukrainian man risked his life to rescue 25 works by her. But Prymachenko’s entire life’s work is now under much greater threat. As Kyiv endures heavy attacks, 650 paintings and drawings by the artist held in the National Folk Decorative Art Museum are at risk, along with everything and everyone in the capital. It’s said that, when some of Prymachenko’s paintings were shown in Paris in 1937, her brilliance was hailed by Picasso, who said: “I bow down before the artistic miracle of this brilliant Ukrainian.” It would make artistic sense. For this young peasant, who never had a lesson in her life, was unleashing monsters and collating fables that chimed with the work of Picasso, and his friends the surrealists. While the dictatorships duked it out architecturally at that International Exhibition, Picasso unveiled Guernica at the Spanish pavilion, using the imagery of the bullfight to capture war’s horrors. Prymachenko, too, dredged up primal myths to tackle the terrifying experiences of Ukrainians. Her pictures from the 1930s are savage slices of farmyard vitality. In one of them, a beautiful peacock-like bird with yellow body and blue wings perches on the back of a brown, crawling creature and regurgitates food into its mouth. Why is the glorious bird feeding this flightless monster? Is it an act of mercy – or a product of grotesque delusion? In another drawing, an equally colourful bird appears to have its own young in its mouth. Carrying it tenderly, you might think, but only if you know nothing of the history of Ukraine. At first sight, Prymachenko might seem just colourful, decorative and “naive”, a folkloric artist with a strong sense of pattern. Certainly, her later post-1945 works are brighter, more formal and relaxing. But there is a much darker undertow to her earlier creations. For Prymachenko became an artist in the decade when Stalin set out to destroy Ukraine’s peasants. Rural people starved to death in their millions in the famine he consciously inflicted on Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933. Initially, food supplies failed because of the sudden, ruthless attempt to “collectivise” agriculture. Peasants were no longer allowed to farm for themselves but were made to join collectives in a draconian policy that was meant to provide food for a new urban proletariat. Ukraine was, and is, a great grain-growing country but the shock of collectivisation threw agriculture into chaos. The Holodomor, as this terror-famine is now called, is widely seen as genocide: Stalin knew what was happening and yet doubled down, denying relief, having peasants arrested or worse if they begged in cities or sought state aid. In a chilling presage of Putin’s own logic and arguments, this cruelty was driven by the ludicrous notion that the hungry were in fact Ukrainian nationalists trying to undermine Soviet rule. “It seems reasonable,” writes historian Timothy Snyder in his indispensable book Bloodlands, “to propose a figure of approximately 3.3 million deaths by starvation and hunger-related disease in Soviet Ukraine in 1932-1933”. These were not pretty deaths and they took place all around Prymachenko in her village of Bolotnya. Some people were driven to cannibalism before they died. The corpses of the starved in turn became food. Born in 1908, Prymachenko was in her early 20s when she witnessed this vision of hell on Earth – and survived it to become an artist. But the fear did not end when the famine did. Just as her work was sent to Paris in 1937, Stalin’s Great Terror was raging. It is often pictured as a butchery of urban intellectuals and politicians – but it came to the Ukrainian countryside, too. So it would take a very complacent eye not to see the disturbing side of Prymachenko’s early art. The bird in its parent’s mouth, the peacock feeding a brute. Maybe there is also survivor guilt, and a feeling of alienation from a destroyed habitat, in such images of strange misbegotten creatures lost in a nature they can’t work and don’t comprehend. One of her fantastic beasts appears blind, its toothy mouth open in a sad lamentation, as it stumbles through a garden on four numbed clodhopping feet. A serpent and a many-headed hydra also appear among the flowers, like deceptively beautiful, yet murderous intruders in Eden. In another of these mid-1930s works, a glorious bird rears back in fear as a smaller one perches on its breast, beak open. There’s nothing decorative or reassuring about the images that got this brave artist noticed. Far from innocently reviving traditional folk art, her lonely or murderous monsters exist in a nature poisoned by violence. Yet she got away with it – and was even officially promoted right in the middle of Stalin’s Terror, when millions were being killed on the merest suspicion of independent thought. Perhaps this was because even paranoid Stalinists didn’t think a peasant woman posed a threat. Prymachenko remembered that, as a child, she was one day tending animals when she “began to draw real and imaginary flowers with a stick on the sand”. It’s an image that recurs in folk art – this was also how the great medieval painter Giotto started. But it was Prymachenko’s embroidery, a skill passed on by her mother, that first got her noticed and invited to participate in an art workshop in Kyiv. Such origins would inevitably have meant being patronisingly classed by the Soviet system as a peasant artist. An “intellectual” who produced such work could have ended up in the gulag or worse. Yet, to see the sheer miracle of her achievement, you must also set Prymachenko in her time as well as her place. The Soviet Union in the 1930s was relentlessly crushing imagination as Stalin imposed absolute conformity. The Ukrainian writer Mikhail Bulgakov couldn’t get his surreal fantasies published, even though, in a tyrannical whim, Stalin read them himself and spared the writer’s life. But the apparent rustic naivety of Prymackenko’s work let her create mysterious, insidiously macabre art that had more in common with surrealism than socialist realism. Then, incredibly, life in Ukraine got worse. Prymachenko had found images to answer famine but she fell silent in the second world war, when Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union made Ukraine one of the first places Jews were murdered en masse. In September 1941, 33,771 Kyiv Jews were shot and their bodies tossed into a ravine outside their city. Prymachenko was working on a collective farm and had no colours to paint. In the 1960s, she was the subject of a liberating revival, her folk designs helping to seed a new Ukrainian consciousness. There’s an almost hippy quality to her 60s art. You can see how it appealed to a younger audience, keen to reconnect with their Ukrainian identity. The country has other artists to be proud of, not least Kazimir Malevich, a titan of the avant garde famous for Black Square, the first time a painting wasn’t a painting of something. Yet you can see why Prymachenko is so loved. Her art, with its rustic roots, expresses the hope and pride of a nation. But the past she evokes is no innocent age of happy rural harmony. What she would make of Putin’s terror one can only guess and fear.",Arts/Art and design,Ukraine’s best loved artist: ‘A symbol of survival in the midst of a dictator’s war’,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/18/ukraine-best-loved-artist-peasant-maria-prymachenko-terrifying-fooled-stalin-dictator
3/18/2022,"If the negotiations over Democrats’ Build Back Better Act had gone differently, tens of millions of American families would have received checks on Tuesday. Instead, for the third month in a row, the monthly payments from the expanded child tax credit were not distributed. The monthly checks, which were approved last year as part of Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief package, had become a lifeline for many families struggling to financially recover from the pandemic. But the payments came to an end in December, after Democrats failed to pass their Build Back Better Act, which would have extended the policy. Those monthly payments helped temporarily lift millions of American children out of poverty, and the policy’s lapse has had a devastating effect. According to a report from Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy, 3.7 million more American children were experiencing poverty in January, after the monthly payments ended. The increase was disproportionately high among Black and Latino children. Progressives have continued to advocate for the expanded credit, insisting an extension of the monthly payments should be included in any social spending package that Democrats can get through Congress. But the policy appears to have no path forward in the evenly divided Senate, underscoring Democrats’ challenges in trying to advance Biden’s economic agenda. Some Democrats fear that failing to extend the expanded credit will further damage the party’s prospects in the midterm elections, making it more difficult for candidates to make a case for re-election to voters. The expanded tax credit was initially enacted through the American Rescue Plan, which Biden signed into law last March. The new policy increased the tax benefit from $2,000 per year to a maximum of $3,600 per year for children aged five or younger and a maximum of $3,000 per year for children between the ages of six and 17. The credit allowed families to collect half of the benefit through monthly checks, which were distributed between July and December of last year. The policy also made the tax credit fully refundable, meaning more low-income parents could access the funds. In December, the last month that the payments were sent out, more than 36 million American households received checks. “Talk about a program that has shown its worth in spades. So effective, so necessary. We’ve seen the results immediately,” Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Thursday. Jayapal even invited a Seattle mother of three who benefitted from the monthly payments, Leanne Do, as her “virtual guest” to the State of the Union earlier this month. Despite the clear impact of the payments and progressives’ passion for the policy, Democrats appear to be at an impasse when it comes to continuing the monthly checks. The version of the Build Back Better Act that passed the House in November included a one-year extension of the expanded child tax credit. But that bill has stalled in the Senate because of Senator Joe Manchin’s opposition to the proposal. “It’s a question of what can get 50 votes. And unfortunately, we’re still coming up against that barrier,” Jayapal said. “I don’t know what to say other than it’s incredibly frustrating to a lot of us.” Democrats are now trying to resurrect components of the Build Back Better Act that can win Manchin’s approval, specifically the provisions aimed at combating climate change and lowering prescription drug costs. But as the party cautiously approaches negotiations again, there have been conspicuously few mentions of extending the expanded child tax credit. In his State of the Union speech, Biden emphasized the importance of enacting various pieces of his economic agenda, including strengthening domestic supply chains and investing in clean-energy sources. In the hour-long speech, Biden devoted only one half of one sentence to the expanded child tax credit. “Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the child tax credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty,” Biden told lawmakers. On Monday, the president acknowledged the challenges he has faced in trying to extend the expanded credit. “It was something we should be doing again, but I’m having trouble getting it passed again,” Biden said at the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference. That trouble is largely thanks to one member of Biden’s own party. Manchin announced in December that he would not support the Build Back Better Act, saying the bill’s $1.7tn price tag was too much to stomach when US inflation has hit a 40-year high. Privately, Manchin also told colleagues that he feared parents would waste the money from the expanded child tax credit on drugs, according to HuffPost. (Surveys show parents report spending the extra money on food, rent and utilities.) Progressives in Congress are continuing to fight for the policy, but they are clear-eyed about the odds of passing an extension with the narrowest of majorities in the Senate. “As far as the path forward, I would love to say yes, but at this point, I don’t see it, and I haven’t heard a lot of conversations about how to get there,” said progressive Congresswoman Cori Bush, who noted that many of her constituents were “devastated” when the payments ended. If the policy is not reinstated, it could deal another blow to Democrats’ already bleak prospects in the midterm elections. Republicans are currently favored to retake control of the House, and the failure to pass the Build Back Better Act – and specifically the extension of the expanded child tax credit – may make voters even less inclined to re-elect Democrats. Party leaders have tried to frame Congress’s failure to extend the payments as a reflection on Republicans. Chris Taylor, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, noted that not a single Republican supported the American Rescue Plan, which initiated the monthly payment. “We are going to make sure the record is clear for voters: House Democrats delivered for families when things got tough,” Taylor said. “Every single Republican in Congress voted against helping your family.” With the Build Back Better Act stalled, progressives are also trying to find other avenues for helping families who are financially struggling. On Thursday, the Congressional Progressive Caucus released a list of executive orders that Biden should sign to advance Democrats’ policy agenda. The list includes demands to lower prescription drug costs, expand overtime eligibility and cancel federal student loan debt, among other suggestions. Jayapal pledged that progressives would continue to push for the passage of the Build Back Better Act, including an extension of the expanded child tax credit. But she argued the proposed executive orders represented a strong starting point for helping average Americans’ monthly budgets, which could in turn boost Democrats’ chances in the midterms. “We’ve got to make sure that we’re addressing the increase in housing costs, in childcare, in gas prices, and all the things that we’re seeing right now – and addressing that for people who are on the margins,” Jayapal said on Thursday. “Let’s deliver some relief quickly for people. And yes, anything we do between now and November helps us.”",News/US news,The uphill battle to resurrect the US child tax credit that lifted millions from poverty ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/us-child-tax-credit-lapsed
3/18/2022,"Back in 2020, when the workers and tourists abandoned London’s West End, Covent Garden was left almost ghoulishly silent. The days of long queues for Matilda the Musical, pre-theatre set menus and Yoda street performers were over for ever, I was certain. Patently, I was an idiot, because full high-octane tourist bedlam has now been restored, and an all-new Lahpet has entered the fray down one of the newly prettified sidestreets off Long Acre. This cool, casual, modern restaurant, which serves Burmese comfort food, was founded by Dan Anton and Burmese chef Zaw Mahesh, and began life as a stall on Maltby Street near London Bridge, before moving first into an arch in Hackney and then to a popular restaurant in Shoreditch; this new, double-floored affair on Slingsby Place is their most ambitious project to date. (Incidentally, if you have a passing knowledge of London, it’s about three minutes’ walk from Pineapple Dance Studios, and probably less if you did it exuberantly in leg warmers.) The delicious and, for Brits, often intriguing and lesser-explored flavours of Myanmar are a welcome addition to the Yards, Covent Garden’s spanking new shopping precinct. Here, a flashy, multi-floored, glass-fronted but ultimately unappealing Caffè Concerto sits close to the bland yet reliable all-day brunch spot Bill’s; there’s also a Dishoom (ever dependable, but completely oversubscribed) and a sleek Italian wine bar, Dalla Terra. But this repurposed nook of Covent Garden feels brazenly unbothered by its place in the capital, because the Yards could really be anywhere: a mall in Dubai, say, the Newcastle Metro Centre or one of those faceless retail strips featuring a Roly’s Fudge outlet and a shop that sells pleasant jumpers. It’s a brave, but utterly welcome move to open a joint that serves lahpet thohk (tea-leaf salad) and a contemporary take on mohinga, a traditional rice-noodle fish soup, which here is delightfully spicy (they will warn you about that if you order it). It perhaps needs saying that Lahpet is one of London’s very few purveyors of Burmese cuisine, now that the Mandalay Golden Myanmar in Kilburn seems to be permanently closed (Kiln, the much-loved Thai grill on Brewer Street, occasionally has Shan tofu and a restorative Burmese pork belly curry on the menu, but is perhaps a little experimental for purists). The sterling work of Burmese food writers and supper-club legends the Rangoon Sisters has gone a long way towards introducing us to the specifics of this country’s food – the crunchiness, the delicate sourness, the breakfast soups, the complex salads and, maybe my favourite thing about this cuisine, the glorious, rapturous brown-ness and mauve-ness. That lahpet thohk salad is a sterling example of this delightful funkiness, with pickled tea leaves interwoven with double-fried beans,wisps of chopped cabbage, plump, sweet bursts of tomato and salty dried shrimp; sesame seeds, crunchy peanuts and a liberal amount of garlic oil and raw garlic also put in an appearance. To a western gaze, at least, this might be unlike any salad seen before, plus it’s the colour of Fozzie Bear and army-surplus combat pants. It comes with a warning that, due to the level of caffeine in it, it may well keep you up at night. Each time I order lahpet thohk, I’m unsure I love it, but I am always compelled to scoop up every last complex, enticing bite. We also had all three of the grilled skewers, which are frankly incredible; in fact, a dinner of just these skewers and a couple of cocktails would be an evening well spent. The chicken thigh is outstanding and the black tiger prawns, heads and shells on, are impressively fragrant and charred; the Shan tofu fritters, with a finely judged tamarind dip, are also well worth having. The place was heaving with families, children, gossiping friends and giggling groups, and the music was heroically 1980s, with a strong line in the finest clever pop and electro. As Smalltown Boy by Bronksi Beat merged into Talking Heads’ And She Was, it was almost as if they’d seen me coming. I cleared a bowl of Rakhine mohinga, which could possibly be described as a sort-of chowder full of grilled squid, green beans, half a boiled egg and a good nose-blast of chilli. If you’re passing and just want a cuddle in a bowl, however, go for the coconut noodles with chicken, because it’s a heartwarming, sweetly satisfying coconut broth packed with egg noodles, shallots, perhaps too much spring onion and armed with a very good, ornate, crispy wonton. Puddings, on the other hand, are not up to much – banana parfait was a sort of deconstructed cheesecake that was less than the sum of its parts – but then, that’s the way of things with so many places in the West End these days. But it’s not enough to stop Lahpet Covent Garden now being officially one of my safe places to hide from the jugglers and those people who aggressively punt cut-price haircuts. Yes, it sells caffeine-heavy salad, but some things are worth staying awake for.  Lahpet 21 Slingsby Place, London WC2, 020-4580 1276. Open all week noon-10pm (9pm Sun).

3/18/2022,"Run Rose Run by Dolly Parton and James Patterson (Century, £20)After working his way through a small army of co-authors, including Bill Clinton, James Patterson’s latest collaborator is none other than Dolly Parton, who draws on a lifetime’s experience of the country music scene for this distinctive rags-to-riches thriller. When tiny but determined wannabe singer-songwriter AnnieLee Keyes hitchhikes into Nashville (dirt roads, ol’ blue jeans and trucks abound), she’s not only seeking stardom but hoping to outrun her (fairly easily guessable) past. Befriended by Ethan Blake, a handsome army veteran turned musician, and Ruthanna Ryder, retired country legend and, one suspects, Parton’s mouthpiece, AnnieLee learns how to deal with predatory agents and managers and begins to climb the ladder to stardom. Although the mystery runs a distant second to the fascinating details of the country scene, in particular how it treats female artists, the likable trio will have you rooting for them all the way – and Parton has released an album of songs to accompany the book. Reputation by Sarah Vaughan (Simon & Schuster, £14.99)Vaughan’s timely and chilling new novel highlights how female politicians are not only judged more harshly than their male counterparts, but also receive vastly disproportionate amounts of online abuse. High-profile MP Emma Webster, who has launched a campaign to protect women from revenge porn, is the recipient of rage-fuelled messages from anonymous internet trolls as well as threats from an angry constituent who thinks she’s not doing enough to address his – equally legitimate – grievance. It isn’t only her own life that becomes more perilous as her star rises; her 14-year-old daughter, Flora, is being bullied and ostracised by her schoolmates. Flora is driven to retaliate with some cyberbullying of her own, the narrative threatens to get out of hand – and Emma finds herself on trial for murder. Vaughan never shies away from the moral complexities in this unsparing exploration of the pressures women face both in private and public life, while masterfully retaining the suspense right up to the last page. Lady Joker by Kaoru Takamura, translated by Marie Iida and Allison Markin Powell (John Murray, £16.99)This kidnap-and-extortion story, first published in 1997 and now translated into English, is only half of a Japanese bestseller, with the concluding book due to be published in the autumn. Those who aren’t keen on delayed gratification may prefer to wait a while – or, since the first volume runs to a wrist-spraining 576 pages, may need to get reading right away. Sections focus on single characters in the all-male cast (the women, so far at least, are mere walk-ons). We begin with the five kidnappers – each of whom has a grudge against the giant Hinode beer company and its CEO, who is to be the kidnappee – and move on to the journalists who are covering the story, and the police (there’s a handy dramatis personae at the front in case you lose track). Challenging but rewarding, Lady Joker is a panoramic view of late 20th-century Japanese society, rife with social injustice and corporate corruption: a fascinating slow burn of a book, detailed, complex and immersive. Mouth to Mouth by Antoine Wilson (Atlantic, £12.99)In contrast to Takamura’s book, Wilson’s third novel is a short but perfectly formed Highsmithian morality tale. The unnamed narrator, a struggling fortysomething author, is at JFK waiting for a delayed flight when a chance encounter with a former classmate results in an invitation to the first-class lounge. There Jeff Cook, who has clearly done well for himself, recounts how, about 20 years earlier, the course of his life was changed when he rescued a drowning stranger from the Pacific ocean. When he later learned that the person he had saved was an important art dealer, Cook tracked him down, insinuating himself into his life. The dealer, a man of questionable morals, took Cook under his wing, and their fates became entwined … Wilson makes subtle, clever use of the framing device in this compact story of destiny, deception and plausibility. Hot Water by Christopher Fowler (Titan, £8.99)The author of the Bryant & May series turns his attention away from London for a darkly comic thriller about the English middle classes on holiday in the French Riviera. Married wine merchant Steve, in lust with the embarrassingly younger Summer, flies her out to a hired villa for some adulterous sexy-time a week before anyone else arrives. But his plans are stymied by his London work schedule, and Summer is left to her own devices.

3/18/2022,"Apowerful and quietly subversive study of masculinity set in rural Montana, Thomas Savage’s 1967 novel is enjoying a moment in the spotlight thanks to Jane Campion’s film adaptation, which has been nominated for 12 Oscars. The book opens with a vivid description of a rancher castrating a young bull and tossing its testicles on the fire next to the branding irons, the symbolism of which is hard to miss. Actor Chad Michael Collins is the narrator, giving distinctive voice to the sibling protagonists: the domineering and loudly homophobic Phil Burbank (Benedict Cumberbatch in the film) and his quieter, meeker brother, George. The pair, who are “more than partners, more than brothers”, oversee the running of a vast cattle farm inherited from their retired parents, and still sleep in the bedroom they shared as children. But their steady existence is upset when George unexpectedly marries a local widow, Rose, and moves her into the ranch. This prompts Phil to embark on a monstrous bullying campaign in an attempt to drive her away. Matters are further complicated when Rose’s “sissy” son, Peter, comes to live with them, forcing Phil to confront who he really is. The audiobook comes with a fascinating and heartfelt afterword written and read by The Shipping News author Annie Proulx, who hails Savage’s “brilliant and tough book … Something aching and lonely and terrible of the west is caught for ever [in his novels], and the most compelling and painful of these books is The Power of the Dog, a work of literary art.”  The Power of the Dog is available on Penguin Audio, 8hr 20 min The Sleeping BeautiesSuzanne O’Sullivan, Picador, 10hr 16minThe neurologist and writer narrates her book on outbreaks of “mystery” illnesses, such as refugees falling into prolonged comas.

3/18/2022,"Every now and then, a mooted movie project just sounds so right that you can almost touch it, even if it has about as much chance of actually being shown in multiplexes as Vladimir Putin does of winning the Nobel peace prize. Reports this week suggest that Cate Blanchett, the much garlanded doyenne of serious cinema, was not so long ago being lined up to star in a Star Trek movie for Noah Hawley, the director of Fargo (the TV edition) and Legion. Regular readers of this blogpost will be aware that Paramount decided to go a different way with the next instalment in the continuing adventures of the Starship Enterprise. They’re bringing back Chris Pine’s Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto’s Spock, along with their rebooted comrades from the JJ Abrams-led trilogy, but Wandavision director Matt Shakman will be the man in the command chair instead. That means that we’ll start hearing things leaking out about how Hawley’s version might have gone down, and one of these nuggets is Blanchett involvement. Exactly what role she would have played is not public knowledge, but the thought of the Australian actor as the captain of her own Star Fleet starship, battling weird-looking aliens and discovering anomalies in deepest space is so irresistible that it probably is already happening right now in a much cooler alternate reality than the unfortunate one we happen to be living in. Why Blanchett has only appeared in a handful of major genre projects in her career – her Galadriel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Irina Spalko in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and the son of Odin’s nefarious sister Hela in Thor: Ragnarok spring to mind – is a mystery. Few other actors can chew scenery with such lustful ferocity and mischievous glee as the awards-season favourite. Yet so often she seems restricted to the kind of movies that only critics see. Perhaps Blanchett’s infuriating absence from genre fare is down to the fact that, on occasion, she has clearly chosen the wrong projects. Spalko may be Steven Spielberg’s favourite Indie villain, but Kingdom of the Crystal Skull itself was a pretty clumsy attempt to jump the shark from swashbuckling archeological fantasy to po-faced sci-fi. Which brings us to Blanchett’s latest foray into mainstream cinema, the forthcoming video game adaptation Borderlands. Whuu? I hear you ask. Yes, Blanchett is to take the lead in a big-screen take on the 2009 open world first-person “looter shooter”, as Lilith, described as an infamous outlaw with a mysterious past who reluctantly returns to her home planet of Pandora (no, not that one) to find a powerful tyrant’s missing daughter. The movie is being directed by Eli Roth, he of the Hostel movies and that god-awful remake of Death Wish. It all sounds about as tantalising as a tasty bowl of Klingon gagh. Can’t we just get Hela back in the Marvel game? The Asgardian deity may have died at the end of Ragnarok at the hands of the fire demon Surtur, but how exactly do you kill off the Goddess of Death? I mean, there have to be screenwriting workarounds here to help restore her to the action. After all, DC brought Superman back with a box of nonsense and some sticky back plastic! If that’s not on, perhaps Paramount can find some way of featuring Blanchett in Star Trek 4 after all. It needn’t be a huge role: she could be revealed as Scotty’s more elegant, slinky sibling, or as the leader of a race of all-female extra-terrestrials who are about to achieve civilisational nirvana when Kirk accidentally drops a thousand tonnes of tribbles on their capital city. We’ll take anything at this point. Just please don’t waste a double Oscar-winner in a bad Eli Roth video game flick. But hey, this is Star Trek we are talking about. Perhaps we can just pull out the old “red matter” and create an “alternate timeline” in which this article never had to be written because Hollywood studios make better creative decisions. And if not, maybe it’s time to Ragnarok the whole darned place to fiery oblivion.",Arts/Film,Cate Blanchett and Star Trek would be a match made in heaven – please make it happen,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/18/week-in-geek-cate-blanchett-star-trek-genre-film-fantasy
3/18/2022,"At this time of the year it is the yellow of the daffodils and primroses and the rich tones of rare red squirrels as they scamper among the oaks and hawthorns, that catch the eye on Brownsea Island. But an ambitious conservation project to turn swathes of this idyllic spot off the coast of Dorset into a summertime riot of purple and violet is under way. The custodians of the island, the National Trust and the Dorset Wildlife Trust, are expanding and linking fragments of heathland, encouraging the return of hectares of heather. They aim to recreate the sort of Dorset heathland that inspired Thomas Hardy, who evoked the power and mystery of wide-open landscapes in novels such as Return of the Native and The Mayor of Casterbridge. The project is intended to improve the habitat of threatened birds such as the nightjar, a rarely seen nocturnal hunter, and the Dartford warbler, as well as for the 18 species of dragonfly and six species of bat that have been recorded here. It should also improve habitats for lizards, slow worms and the island’s most iconic resident, the red squirrel. As Brownsea Island prepared to greet the first visitors of spring on Saturday, Tim Hartley, lead ranger for the National Trust, explained that over the centuries the heathland on the island had shrunk and become fragmented. “We want to enlarge those pockets of heathland and knit them back together,” he said. “Heathlands depend on human intervention for their survival and what we’re doing is mimicking the work of our ancestors to make sure that the landscape, and the wildlife that depends on it, is still here in centuries to come.” Heathlands, with their gorse and heather, were widespread in England for centuries, formed by farmers to graze their animals and kept alive by the sort of rural people immortalised in Hardy’s work. A drive for productivity in the 20th century saw much of this wild landscape lost in favour of wooded areas and more intensively cultivated farmland. It is believed that only a sixth of the UK’s lowland heath remains, mainly in isolated pockets surrounded by towns and cities. Over the decades, Brownsea changed from a heather-rich island to one dominated by trees and gardens. In the 18th-century, landowners planted pines and created orchards and walled gardens, with little thriving in the shadow of the pines. In the early 20th century, the reclusive Mary Bonham-Christie, nicknamed the Demon of Brownsea, allowed nature to run riot, causing the island to become choked with invasive rhododendron, which loves the acidic soil. The National Trust took over exactly 60 years ago. During the winter, while Brownsea Island has been shut to visitors, clumps of Scots pine have been thinned to let in more light. Workers are also in the process of removing 12.5 hectares (30 acres) of rhododendron. Heather cuttings will be taken from existing patches and scattered across bare soil, allowing new clumps to grow. Seed is being collected from the Purbeck heaths national nature reserve on the mainland and ferried to Brownsea. Twenty five hectares of heathland is to be restored during the five-year project. Naturally, great care has been taken to ensure the red squirrels, for whom Brownsea is one of only two stable enclaves in the south of England, will benefit. Hartley said: “By opening up these woodlands, we’re making space for trees to regenerate and encouraging them to form lower branches and bigger canopies, which means more food and better homes for red squirrels.” He said the idea was not to clear all trees but to create a diverse wooded heath habitat. Luke Johns, Poole harbour reserves officer at Dorset Wildlife Trust, said the project would make a huge difference to wildlife habitats on the island. He said: “Our nature reserve in the northern part of the island provides sanctuary for rare and threatened species, from tiny insects and ground-nesting birds to the rare red squirrel and the water vole in its woods, reed beds and lagoon. These heathland and woodland restoration works are going to improve, expand and link up habitats across the island.”",News/UK news,Plans to restore Brownsea Island to Dorset heathland of Thomas Hardy ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/plans-to-restore-brownsea-island-to-dorset-heathland-of-thomas-hardy
3/18/2022,"At the start of January I burned through what I was sure at the time was the nailed-on best show of 2022. Station Eleven (available on HBO Max in the US and Starzplay in the UK), which I’ve already wanged on about a couple of times in previous newsletters, is a drama set in the aftermath of a deadly flu pandemic that manages to be simultaneously gripping, deeply sad and quietly optimistic about the future of humanity. Following an interconnected cast of characters through the pre- and post-apocalypse, the show is told in a fragmentary, time-skipping manner that is bewildering at first but becomes satisfying and revelatory once you adjust to its rhythms. Its cast is stacked with talent (Mackenzie Davis and Himesh Patel deserve to gobble up all the awards they’re pointed at). And it’s gorgeous to look at, full of grand, sparsely populated vistas – a product of the real pandemic that was raging while the show was filming. So, yes, Station Eleven: fantastic, stunning, a high watermark for TV, etc… BUT then, last week, I caught up with Apple TV+’s Severance, and suddenly Station Eleven’s procession to that best show of the year gong isn’t looking quite as certain. Set in what is either the future or a parallel present, this sci-fi thriller follows employees at a mysterious company who opt to have their brains modified so they only remember their work lives at work and their home lives at home. A strange premise for sure, but Severance twists it into one of the most singularly inventive and thought-provoking series I’ve seen in quite some time, mulling over everything from our relationship with work (it’s already been dubbed the first “great resignation thriller”) to bodily autonomy. As in Station Eleven, there’s some trickery at play with the storytelling. The bifurcated existence of the characters allows the show’s creators to keep information from both them and us – but never in a way that feels frustrating. And the cast (Adam Scott, Britt Lower, John Turturro, Christopher Walken) and behind-the-scenes talent (Ben Stiller directed a sizeable chunk of the series) are seriously impressive too. Befitting a show directed by Stiller, Severance is very funny at times, when it’s not harrowing and/or puzzling. Oh: and it’s stunning to look at, though in a completely different way to Station Eleven, finding pleasing symmetry in prefab office spaces, never-ending corridors and claustrophobic cubicles. Paradoxically, both these series have rocked up at a time when there’s plenty to despair about in the world of scripted TV, with the sudden influx of remakes, reboots and superhero franchises, and the surfeit of soulless cash-in dramas about real-life scammers and scumbags. These two shows, though, feel like one-offs. You can see the faintest outline of influences in each – The Leftovers for Station Eleven, the work of Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry for Severance – but these inspirations have been bent into strange new shapes. Both shows also have an almost preternatural timeliness in their themes: not through some desperate desire to be “of the moment” but through a fascination with the persistent questions that underpin our age. Are these already the best two shows of the year? Severance is only two-thirds of the way through its nine-episode opening series, and might completely botch the landing (no such worries for Station Eleven, which, as a limited single series, has already wrapped things up pretty expertly). And it’s only the middle of March. There’s a long way to go and plenty of television to come: a new series of Donald Glover’s game-changing Atlanta starts next week in the US, the final season of Better Call Saul airs next month and all manner of much-anticipated shows are in the pipeline. Even so, if Station Eleven and Severance aren’t in the running when the end-of-year lists are finally drawn up, 2022 will have been a very good year for TV.

3/18/2022,"The boss of JD Wetherspoon has warned of increased costs caused by the rising price of food and drink products and soaring energy bills, as the pub chain cut losses and said business was close to returning to pre-pandemic levels. Tim Martin, the outspoken chairman and founder, said he expected to be able to hold the increase in costs to just below the level of inflation. UK inflation is at a 30-year high of 5.5% and is expected to rise to almost 8% in April, with fears it could hit double digits as a consequence of the war in Ukraine. “There is pressure on input costs from food, drink and energy suppliers, mitigated to an extent, by a number of long-term contracts,” Martin said. “Overall, the company expects the increase in input prices to be slightly less than the level of inflation.” On Thursday, the Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.75% in an attempt to curb the soaring cost of living. Martin said JD Wetherspoon had benefited from nearly 70% of its 800-plus pubs being freehold, with mortgage rates fixed for the next decade. He added that most of its leasehold pubs had rent reviews that were also fixed below the current level of inflation. JD Wetherspoon said it was finally seeing a return to more normal trading patterns, after the last restrictions were lifted after the spread of the Omicron Covid variant over Christmas and the new year. Sales in the three weeks to 13 March were only 2.6% down on pre-pandemic levels, as the group more than halved its losses to £21.6m in the six months to 23 January. “Following a traumatic two years for many businesses and people, the ending of Covid restrictions has brought a return to more normal trading patterns in recent weeks,” Martin said. The company had not been affected by labour shortages reported in some sectors, operating with a “full complement of staff”, he added. There were no significant supply chain issues affecting the business, which he described as “fully stocked, with some minor exceptions”. Martin, an outspoken critic of government policies to curb the pandemic, said: “Draconian restrictions, which amount to a lockdown-by-stealth, are, of course, kryptonite for hospitality, travel, leisure and many other businesses. The company is confident of a strong future if restrictions are avoided.” The London-listed business has a market value of more than £1bn. It has 859 pubs across the country – 13 fewer than a year ago and down from a peak of 951 in 2015.",News/Business,JD Wetherspoon to raise prices as pub sales continue recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/jd-wetherspoon-prices-pub-sales-pandemic
3/18/2022,"Arsenal may be tired as they travel up to Birmingham but they should not be disheartened after a battling defeat to Liverpool. Mikel Arteta’s side simply lack the strength in depth of the Reds and a striker who can finish their slick moves; Alexandre Lacazette would likely be Jürgen Klopp’s sixth best option in attack if he were to switch allegiances. Regardless Arsenal have a good chance to continue their mission to clinch fourth spot against Aston Villa. The high likelihood of Bukayo Saka bearing down on Ashley Young feels like an avenue to instant success as Lucas Digne looks set to miss out. Villa will also be disappointed if former Gunner Callum Chambers is out with a head injury as he has proved an instant hit for Steven Gerrard. A depleted defence may not be enough though as Arteta has made a lot of noise about Arsenal’s exhaustion and if he is not just blowing smoke then Philippe Coutinho’s magic could derail the manager’s best laid plans further.

3/18/2022,"If you’re the founder of a small business that’s making waves across the UK, you may well be more than happy with the way things are. But for many British business owners, the ultimate goal is to export their goods and services around the world. This is particularly the case in the UK’s knowledge-economy sector, where innovative SMEs have the potential to change lives and benefit communities far and wide if they can gain access to markets overseas. Among the many SMEs actively pursuing international opportunities are medical imaging business Axial3D, indoor farming experts LettUs Grow, and disability access consultancy Direct Access – all united by a shared vision to make a difference working with customers around the world. Based in Belfast, Axial3D is pioneering technology that turns 2D MRI and CT scans into highly precise 3D images that can be used by surgeons worldwide and even turned into 3D printed models. These images and models are then used to plan complex neuro, cardio, orthopaedic and cancer surgeries, and for creating patient-specific implants. Axial3D’s CEO Roger Johnston sees huge opportunities worldwide “Currently, for many complex surgeries, 2D imaging can be difficult to interpret, so surgeons often go into, say, a cardiac operation with multiple plans in their head, to cover the different scenarios they might find,” says Axial3D’s CEO Roger Johnston. “But if I turn that 2D image into an incredibly precise 3D one, the surgeon can typically plan on just one scenario. We’ve found that 53% change their surgery plan when they see the models, that surgery time is cut on average by 62 minutes, and that patients leave hospital 16% faster. “Our imaging has helped an amazing range of operations, such as separating conjoined twins, removing tumours, and performing complex heart surgery on babies, so we’re making a real difference to patients every day. Axial3D’s precise imagery can be turned into 3D printed models “We can also provide these perfect 3D images at a price anyone who can access 2D imaging can afford. We’re changing healthcare – and that’s what gets us out of bed in the morning. “We’ve been used by around 50 NHS trusts, but in global terms, the UK is a relatively small market. There are huge opportunities for our product across the world. “Because surgeons can order models on our website, we’ve been receiving orders from all around the world since we started commercialising two years ago. We’re now used in more than 300 hospitals in 30 countries, ranging from the Middle East, to South America, the US, and even Nepal.” Further export opportunities mean Axial3D’s patented system has the potential to save thousands more lives every week. To maximise these openings, the company is tapping into international marketing expertise from the Department for International Trade (DIT) and its partners at Invest Northern Ireland. “Sometimes it takes time for the full impact of this kind of support to be recognised, but we’ve already doubled the size of our marketing activities,” Johnston says. “We now sell over 70% of our models outside the UK, and our business has grown at an average of 250% per year for each of the last three years.” This kind of high-growth potential is part of the vision at LettUs Grow, which was founded in 2015 by three University of Bristol graduates, Charlie Guy, Jack Farmer and Ben Crowther. They have ambitious plans for their indoor farming technology, which enables food to be grown faster and more sustainably. The business came about from us looking at some of the issues in food production,” says Guy, the company’s CEO. “These ranged from food waste in our supply chains, through to the fact that we have to import a huge amount of fresh produce into the UK. LettUs Grow already works with partners in other countries and sees many more export opportunities “Over the years, we’ve developed technology to create vertical farms, which can bring resilience to food-supply networks and will be key to the future of sustainable farming. In these farms, instead of plants growing in soil, or in a hydroponic solution, plant roots are exposed to a very fine mist that feeds them a specific, optimised set of nutrients and water, and enables them to grow much faster. “Our very first product, a small aeroponic grow-at-home kit, has now transformed into a 40ft container farm. We can provide growing systems that enable producers to grow 365 days a year in any geographic or climatic conditions.” The trio’s patent-pending technology has huge potential in the UK but there are even more opportunities abroad, especially in places such as Scandinavia, where there’s very little natural light in winter, or the Middle East, where water is at a premium. To build the business’s export arm, LettUs Grow has been exploring potentially lucrative markets including China, South Korea, Singapore and the US, as well as Europe, looking at which new territories are best suited to its technology, and where to focus its energies when it comes to exports. In LettUs Grow’s innovative vertical farms, instead of growing plants in soil, roots are exposed to a fine mist containing optimised nutrients “We’ve proved the technology here in the UK, and now the exciting thing for us is taking that technology to the world,” says Guy. “DIT’s support has enabled us to make a detailed assessment of different markets, and that means we’re now working on substantial projects with partners in other countries, some of which dwarf any of the projects we’ve delivered in the UK. “Everyone who works for LettUs Grow wants to make a positive change to the environment, but that means having an impact on a global scale. And that’s very much where we want to take our business.” Steve Dering, COO of Direct Access, believes that international experience is a plus The built environment is as crucial as the natural one, and this is where Direct Access is helping to improve the daily lives of millions. What started as a one-man operation in a spare room in Nantwich, Cheshire, is now a thriving business with eight staff that helps organisations improve their accessibility through workplace assessments, training and audits, and which designs accessible products such as hearing loops and evacuation chairs. Unusually, the business is fully staffed by disabled people – including its COO Steve Dering who is profoundly deaf – and this has made expansion into the export market more challenging. “In some ways, the changes because of the pandemic have been good for deaf people because video calls have become more widespread,” says Dering. “But it’s still not easy for us to just pick up the phone and talk to someone. “Our founder, Steven Mifsud, always tells us: ‘Don’t let location be your anchor.’ Being able to understand businesses overseas and how to approach them is really helpful for that. When we looked at exporting to France, we made sure all our PowerPoint presentations and emails were in French, and that we had a translator. I think clients appreciated that, while we’re deaf, we were still able to communicate. I’ll sometimes send DIT an email I’ve written in French so they can check the language and tone, because if you get those small things right, it makes a big difference.” Direct Access began its exporting journey after attending a disabilities conference in Dubai in 2017. “That conference, and the conversations we had there, led to our first contract, which we won to help make Expo 2020 Dubai as inclusive as possible,” says Dering. “We now work in France, Canada, Saudi Arabia and the US. “Accessibility standards in other countries can be lower than in the UK, so we’re there to teach best practice to companies that want to go above the minimum, as well as supplying our accessibility products – people like to buy British, because of the quality. “One of the reasons we’ve been so successful is that we have international expertise, and people want to understand what we do in other countries. The world is getting smaller because people like to travel, and if you have consistency of accessibility wherever you go, it makes the world better for everyone.” To find out more about getting started with exporting goods and services, and what resources are available for your business, visit great.gov.uk",Going global with business,Taking tech to the world: three firms changing lives beyond UK shores,https://www.theguardian.com/going-global-with-business/2022/mar/18/taking-tech-to-the-world-three-firms-changing-lives-beyond-uk-shores
