3/1/2022,"The UK’s deputy prime minister has suggested Ukrainians would prefer to flee to countries nearer to home amid criticism that the Britain’s support for refugees is “heartless” and pressure to offer more help from Conservative MPs. Under plans set out on Sunday evening, Ukrainian nationals settled in the UK will be able to bring their “immediate family members” to join them, which applies only to spouses, unmarried partners of at least two years, parents or their children if one is under 18, or adult relatives who are also carers. In contrast, the European Union is preparing to grant all Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years, senior officials said on Monday. Asked why the UK was not matching the EU’s offer, Raab told Sky News: “In relation to the Europeans, of course they’re closer to Ukraine and as the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK said over the weekend it will often be the case that … most Ukrainians will want to stay in Ukraine, but if they leave they’ll want to be as close to their home country as possible in order to be able to come back in the future.” Raab said the UK scheme would allow up to 100,000 Urkainians to come, adding: “I think that’s the right way to approach.” On Monday, Boris Johnson, the prime minister, received a letter from members of the One Nation Conservatives group, led by the former Home Office minister Damian Green, criticising the UK’s response and also signed by the former ministers Jeremy Hunt, Caroline Nokes and Sir Robert Buckland. “We need sincere and immediate support for the Ukrainian people. The United Kingdom cannot flag or fail, our message must be clear: Ukrainian victims of war seeking refuge are welcome,” the letter says. The One Nation caucus, which is often seen as a centrist grouping in the party, has about 40 members. The shadow home secretary, Labour’s Yvette Cooper, also said the government needed to do more to help Ukrainians fleeing war and seeking to rejoin friends and family in the UK. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “At the moment, what the Home Office is doing is trying to just tweak the existing system. They’re trying to carry on with a version of business as usual, with a version of asking people to apply for traditional work visas or traditional visitor visas or traditional family visas that are still narrowly drawn. “And the normal system just doesn’t work when you are facing war in Europe, when you’re facing a crisis on this scale. “We need to be fast and flexible – that is what other countries have done in different ways and that is what we can do as well, what we have always done in the past, and I think it’s what people across the country want to do.” Cooper added the Home Office “has simply not done the preparation”, despite weeks of warnings of a Russian invasion in Ukraine and the resulting refugee crisis. Raab warned that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, could respond to resistance in Ukraine with “even more barbaric tactics”. He told Sky News: “We know that Putin will react to this, or we fear that he will react to this, with even more barbaric tactics, that’s why we must be prepared that this could be a long haul.” The former foreign secretary added: “This is turning into a much, much more perilous misadventure for Putin than I think he realised and it has a demoralising effect on Russian forces and it has had the effect of steeling the will of the Ukrainian people. “That’s how we will ensure Putin fails in Ukraine and we’re there for the long haul.”",News/World news,"Ukrainians want to stay near home, claims Raab, amid UK visa criticism",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/ukrainians-want-to-stay-near-home-claims-raab-amid-uk-visa-criticism
3/1/2022,"The reason you don’t see a revolution happening in Moscow is not that people don’t care about what’s happening in Ukraine. On the contrary, my social media feed is filled with posts from Russians opposing the war. “What happened?” they say. “How did we get to this? This is madness!” People are saying they feel guilty about being Russian. People are burning their passports on camera. Hell, I posted: “I am Russian but Putin is not my president.” But there are far fewer people actually out protesting. You have to understand that ordinary people in Russia are scared out of their minds. On the first day of the conflict, almost 1,000 protesters were jailed across Russia for walking outside with as little as a piece of paper that said: “I don’t want war.” According to the independent media source OVD-info, in the first four days of the war more than 5,200 people were arrested. My friend spent time in jail for walking down the same street as the protesters. A professor of sociology, Grigory Yudin, was arrested in the centre of Moscow and reportedly beaten up in the back of an autozak (police bus). There are now more police teams than I can count – with new names such as Rosgvardiya (Russia’s internal military force) – and they are ruthless. These forces were created several years ago specifically to wander the streets of Moscow (and other cities) and prevent anything “suspicious” from happening. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an 18-year-old kid or a pregnant middle-aged woman, they’ll beat you up, put you in a wagon and take you in for questioning. When you have a former KGB agent in charge, you have a country that functions as an enormous jail. It is painfully clear to us that this war is absolutely pointless. Putin is using false history lessons, lamenting the fall of the Soviet Union, and making claims about Nato advancing its forces simply to justify his own madness. I believe that the true answer to the question people ask on social media – “how did we get to this?” – is that Putin is insane. I don’t know when or why this happened. Maybe it’s his age. Maybe his isolation during the pandemic caused him to question his legacy. I could believe anything now. When my wife, who is Ukrainian, and I woke up last Thursday in our Dubai hotel room, our whole world had turned upside down. We turned on Putin’s televised address about the military operation. Twenty minutes later, we turned it off. We were scared by the vagueness of his report. What was a “special military operation”? Was this really a declaration of the third world war? We were disgusted by the theatrical performance of a president we had never chosen. We were even more disgusted by the thought that most people in Russia would believe him. There’s a huge divide of opinions between the “New Russians” – my generation, people born in the 1990s, who never lived in Soviet times – and the older generation. Not one of my friends back home believes that Putin wasn’t planning this war for some time. The older Russians are fed lies by TV and other media to convince them that what Putin is doing is justifiable. The big problem is that there is no coherent ideology in Russia. There is no shared way of interpreting the world. Instead, the simplistic idea that has become prevalent is a story of “us v them”. It’s extremely easy to sell and it gets votes. That’s the agenda that Putin has been pushing for the past decade or so. He says that Ukraine is an enemy that is historically part of Russia but sold itself to Nato, or that everyone in the world is the US’s puppet. These ideas are so contagious. When you try to reason with an average person in Russia, they might say something like: “The TV is right and you’re wrong. Also – you’re probably an agent of the CIA.” Many people live in ever-present fear and it’s easier for them to believe what they’re told. Standing outside the crowd can cost you your freedom. None of my younger Russian friends around the globe are surprised. We’re so used to feeling disappointed and embarrassed by our government that we barely feel shame any more. Like children of abusive parents, after so many years we forget what’s normal and what’s not. We simply sigh, shake our heads, and say: “Well, what did you expect?” The “global Russians”, as we call ourselves, long ago gave up on the prospect of having a country and government we’d be proud of. I can’t help but be reminded of the Soviet war with Afghanistan: 15,000 Russian deaths. Nine years of combat. My mother told me stories of her former classmates, people she actually knew, arriving back in coffins. It was a totally pointless endeavour that cost Leonid Brezhnev the entire economy and helped contribute to the Soviet Union’s collapse. Putin, who is so keen on history, is unknowingly digging his own grave. With Russia cut off from Swift and facing sanctions from the EU, the US, and the UK, it’ll take only a few years before it runs into extremely hard times. And when it does, people will not be afraid any more. If history teaches us anything, it’s that people – even ones as stubborn and patient as the Russians – will not tolerate a lack of food. When the money runs out, so will Putin’s clock. And we – the new generation of Russians – will be waiting.

3/1/2022,"There’s a good reason why Jordan Crane’s amazing new graphic novel, a gorgeous-looking book that comes with rounded corners and thick ivory paper, looks a bit like an expensive journal. Keeping Two is indeed a kind of diary, its narrative comprised almost entirely of the innermost thoughts of its two characters. Just as in a diary, nothing much seems to happen for pages at a time and yet everything does. The wild imaginings of this pair when they’re apart, emotional maelstroms that spiral exhaustingly like endless staircases, will lead in the end to an epiphany for them both: a rising gratitude each for the other that is symbolised by the sudden falling of swollen raindrops across each frame (an image that brought to mind the restorative arrow-shower at the end of Philip Larkin’s The Whitsun Weddings). Crane’s characters have no names; they are a suburban Everycouple. When we first meet them, they’re at home, bickering about who will go out to buy supper and who will stay behind to deal with the dirty dishes. In the end, she goes and while she’s gone, he stands at the kitchen sink, his mind roaming, one thought leading to another, and on and on. He revisits an argument they had while they were out driving; he remembers a conversation they shared in which he insisted that deaths always come in threes; he ponders the impossibly miserable plot of a novel they both read. As the hours tick by, these interconnected and somewhat death-strewn notions begin to coalesce into piercing worry for his girlfriend. He misses her. Where is she? Why is she taking so long? Has something happened? Unable to restrain himself any longer, he heads out to try to find her, a decision that will ultimately precipitate the book’s final, transcendent scenes. Keeping Two, which has been 20 years in the making, isn’t a straightforward read. Crane, an award-winning cartoonist, is ambitious for his medium and his narrative shifts constantly between past and present, fantasy and reality, with a speed that can be confusing; every page – every frame – is bathed in a bright, leafy green and this sometimes makes it hard to read characters’ emotions (after a few hundred pages, it’s pretty tiring on the eye too). But it also repays patience, its powerful climax at once deeply connected to, and utterly at odds with, the frustrating detours that precede it. If it is, at moments, about claustrophobia and loss, its larger message has to do with human connection: how we long for it and yet how easily we take it for granted. Crane suggests, without ever labouring the point, that the words “soon” and “one day” are, once a person reaches a certain point in life, not only weaselly but foolish. Now is the thing. Here is the moment. Sleepwalk through the present and you may find, when you finally wake up, that your so-called future is already long past.

3/1/2022,"The chief executive of the UK’s biggest private pension scheme is seeking to offload its £450m of assets linked to Russia, saying there is a moral as well as financial imperative for companies to do so after the invasion of Ukraine. Simon Pilcher, the head of the Universities Superannuation Scheme, said it had sold off about half of its portfolio of investments connected to Russia in the last few weeks. “We think there is a clear financial as well as a moral case for divestment with respect to our Russian holdings,” said Pilcher, speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday. “Morals drive finance and if you are a financial investor and you don’t think about the moral impacts of what you are doing you are both shortsighted and, dare I say it, immoral.” Pilcher said the moves by the oil and gas companies BP and Shell, which have announced loss-making exits from investments in Russia’s energy industry worth tens of billions of pounds, showed that there was no case for continuing to trade with Russia. “We think that Russia has placed themselves outside of all norms,” he said. “There are very few people that have just been listening to the statements regarding Shell and BP [who wouldn’t think] there is very little appetite for anyone to trade with Russia under these circumstances. It is very hard to see how Russian investments are a sound financial investment. And that completely ignores – and we are not – the moral case.” Pilcher said his team at USS, which has about 500,000 pension customers and £90bn in investments, had found it difficult to find buyers for its Russian assets as the country and its institutions had become toxic for traders since the invasion. “In the current environment there is very little trading,” he said. “It is exceptionally difficult to get a price on anything. We have halved our equity investments relating to Russia in the last several weeks.” Pilcher said that about 0.5% of its £90bn portfolio, a “fairly modest amount”, was linked to Russia. On Monday, KLP, Norway’s largest pension fund, said it would sell off its 500m Norwegian kroner (£42m) of investments in 22 Russian firms including the energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft and the banks VTB and Sberbank. The Norwegian government has also announced that its $1.3tn (£970bn) sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, would divest from Russia. Last week, the Church of England announced it had sold all £20m of investments in Russian companies in response to what the archbishops of Canterbury and York described as Vladimir Putin’s “act of evil” in Ukraine.

3/1/2022,"Transport for London has encouraged people to work from home on Tuesday and Thursday as thousands of tube workers went on strike, crippling the capital’s transport network. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said its members were “solidly supporting” the industrial action with picket lines mounted outside tube stations. Another 24-hour walkout is planned for Thursday, with knock-on effects on services on Wednesday and Friday. The union fears spending cuts will lead to hundreds of job losses and reductions in pensions and working conditions. Transport for London (TfL) has said no jobs would be lost and it has not proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions. TfL’s chief operating officer, Andy Lord, said: “We haven’t proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has or will lose their jobs because of the proposals we have set out, so this action is completely unnecessary. “We know our customers deserve better than this and that is why we’re urging the RMT to talk to us so we can find a resolution to this dispute and call off this action, which is threatening London’s recovery from the pandemic.” Lord told LBC the disruption on London’s tube network on Tuesday and Thursday was different from the strike action held ahead of Christmas last year. He said: “The dispute is across the entire network, whereas the previous dispute before Christmas was with the night tube only with the RMT and on certain lines. “Today it is covering the whole network. We are hoping to run a limited service on some of the lines but I would really encourage customers to check the TfL website and only travel if their journey is essential.” He encouraged people to work from home on Tuesday and Thursday. Asked about what provisions have been made for key workers who were not able to work from home, Lord added: “We’ve laid on extra buses and we also have all our other TfL services which are operating normally. I hope that they will be able to get to work without too much of an inconvenience.” Train passengers in the south of England were also hit by disruption unrelated to the tube strike. Network Rail said a suspected power supply failure had led to a “complete loss of signalling” in Ashtead, Surrey. This was causing delays to services between Epsom and Leatherhead operated by Southern and South Western Railway. Rail replacement buses have been requested. The disruption came on the day rail fares were increased, causing more misery for passengers. A spokesperson for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the strikes would cause disruption to Londoners and businesses trying to recover from two devastating years. “It will also damage TfL’s revenues at a time when TfL is already under huge financial strain due to the pandemic,” they said. “TfL are working to mitigate the impact of the strikes but disruption is inevitable. “The mayor urges Londoners who need to travel on 1 and 3 March to check before they make their journey, consider whether they are able to work from home, and use alternative modes of transport where possible. “Sadiq doesn’t want to see strike action and is imploring the unions to come to the table and work with City Hall and TfL.”",News/UK news,London tube strike: workers stage 24-hour walkout in jobs dispute,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/london-tube-strike-workers-stage-24-hour-walkout-in-jobs-dispute
3/1/2022,"A local authority that slashed children’s speech and language therapy by 50% to help reduce waiting lists has been forced to reverse the policy after a legal challenge that could have implications for other councils. Coram Children’s Legal Centre (CCLC) sent a pre-litigation letter to Norfolk county council warning that the policy was unlawful after a mother of an 11-year-old boy, referred to as H, was told his provision was going to be halved. The mother, who does not wish to be identified, said H had already missed considerable support due to the pandemic. He has an education, health and care plan (EHCPs) that legally entitles him to speech and language therapy. “Families understood and accepted the need for staff to be redeployed to other areas of the NHS during a national health crisis,” she said. “The last thing they expected though, when services were able to be reinstated, was for Norfolk county council to introduce a policy that would dramatically reduce speech and language therapy to the children who need it the most.” The policy was detailed in a document entitled Supporting Children and Young People on the Norfolk and Waveney Speech and Language Therapy Waiting List, which said there were 1,500 on the waiting list and more than 2,400 children actively being supported. To try to reduce the backlog and “release capacity”, it said Covid arrangements for EHCP provision would continue with “an average of 50% provision” for two terms, a move that would have had a dramatic impact on children living in the county who have special needs, according to the CCLC. According to CCLC, H’s support was cut even more, after the council commissioned NHS community services to provide a report on his language and communication needs, which further reduced his sessions by a half – leaving him with a quarter of his original support. CCLC said the council had failed to deliver special educational provision as outlined in H’s EHCP in accordance with section 42 of the Children and Families Act 2014. It also said it was unlawful to review children’s EHCPs outside of the statutory timetable and it should be based only on a change in the child’s needs rather than motivated by the needs of the service. Waiting lists for speech and language therapy are growing in many areas following disruption caused by the pandemic. Qaisar Sheikh, the head of education law at CCLC, said: “The local authority’s withdrawal of the unlawful policy was a great outcome not only for H but all children who access speech and language therapy through their EHCPs in Norfolk. “Following this legal action, we have already been contacted by parent groups in at least one other local authority who have seen similar cuts in services and are looking for legal support.” Michael Bateman, the assistant director for SEND strategic improvement at Norfolk county council, said it was always intended as a short-term plan to make children on the waiting list the top priority for the first two terms of a five-year contract with a new specialist provider. “This decision was taken to increase our support to as many children and their families as possible and has enabled the new provider to reduce the number of children waiting by just under half. “This approach, which was always planned to be short-term, meant a reduced service to some children who were already receiving speech and language therapy. After listening to parents, we have changed this interim approach.”",News/Education,Norfolk reverses huge cuts to boy’s speech therapy after legal challenge,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/01/norfolk-reverses-huge-cuts-to-boys-speech-therapy-after-legal-challenge
3/1/2022,"‘But why should we care about a practice that is being performed overseas?” It was a blunt question put to me by an audience member at a conference on female genital mutilation. Should we care because of a commitment to human rights? Our collective duty to prevent suffering? We have a moral obligation to end the practice in Britain and also to focus efforts on eliminating it globally. After spending many years researching FGM, I have spoken to women who vehemently support it and those that actively resist it. If we are going to end FGM, it is important that we hear all women’s voices, however uncomfortable that may make us. I argue in my new book, FGM: When Culture and Law Clash, that we should all care about FGM happening anywhere, because the practice is connected at home and overseas. The British government’s focus is predominantly on what takes place in the UK. There have been efforts to introduce more legislation – FGM was criminalised in Britain in 1985, with updates to the law in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2003 (2005 in Scotland) and 2015 – although there has only been one conviction, in 2019. Some government funding has been provided to grassroots organisations in the UK and the African-led anti-FGM movement, but not enough. If our efforts mainly focus on protecting girls in Britain from FGM, then we will never end it. It is a global practice. Girls in the UK are taken abroad during the summer school holidays, which is known as the “cutting season”. One woman told me: “I have heard of parents taking their girls back to the home country, like a holiday, and something happens during the holiday and then they come back and they are not the same again.” In some of these cases, children’s services or the police apply to the family courts to obtain an FGM protection order to stop them from leaving. But families continue to evade the law, flying girls abroad under the pretence of visiting relatives. Some girls are taken to countries where FGM is medicalised. A charity worker told me: “We have certainly heard in Dubai that UK customers are their top customers for FGM.” FGM performed abroad is a crime in the UK but police say that enforcing this is almost impossible due to evidential challenges and uncooperative families. Given the international community’s pledge to end FGM by 2030 (as part of the UN Sustainable Goals), it is difficult to reconcile this with the UK government’s hostile approach to asylum seekers at risk. Sometimes, I feel like a broken record, stuck saying the same things for the last decade because I still see vulnerable women and girls denied asylum on the basis of FGM. This is the problem – we have not moved on. There are no statistics on FGM asylum claims in the UK. According to the UNHCR, of the 25,000 girls and women seeking asylum in Europe in 2014, 71% had been victims. The UN refugee agency said that in 2011, more than 2,000 women claiming asylum in the UK were from FGM-risk countries – a quarter of female claims. Many women and girls will be refused asylum and told to return to a country where FGM is a threat. This happened in one of my court cases, where I represented a mother (herself a victim of FGM) trying to protect her daughter from the same fate. Priti Patel, the home secretary, refused her asylum, resulting in costly litigation. I represent many people who have had their asylum claims rejected. One woman who was refused asylum had fled from the Gambia, where she had been forced to become a “cutter”, performing FGM on others. She told me that she was cut aged seven and was deeply traumatised, “the screams that the girls do … sometimes I even scream and think there is blood all over my house, sometimes I will have the flashback that they are cutting someone”. Our anti-FGM policy is disconnected from reality. The government needs to see FGM as not purely a British issue happening in a vacuum, but a global practice. British girls are cut here and abroad. Girls at risk seek safety in Britain, but they are refused the same protection as British girls. It is time our government was committed to protecting all girls and women. No girl is undeserving of living free from FGM.
