3/24/2022,"Fuel prices, already at record levels, could be being pushed higher in 121 locations across the UK as a result of the £7bn takeover of Morrisons by a US private equity firm, the consumer watchdog has said. The Competition and Markets Authority opened an investigation in January into the supermarket chain’s takeover by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), examining matters including a potential lessening in competition between petrol forecourts. With prices predicted to rise further if the war in Ukraine continues for much longer, the CMA found the takeover could make matters worse for motorists. CD&R already owns the petrol station giant Motor Fuel Group (MFG) and won a lengthy auction to buy Bradford-based Morrisons in October. MFG owns 921 petrol stations across England, Scotland and Wales, operating under several brand names, while Morrisons runs 339 petrol stations at its supermarkets. The regulator voiced concerns over 121 areas where MFG and Morrisons both have forecourts and would face “limited competition” from other players after the merger. Colin Raftery, a senior director of mergers at the CMA, said: “Prices for petrol and diesel have recently hit record highs, which makes it even more important that we don’t allow a lack of competition at the pump to make the situation worse. “We’re concerned that this deal could lead to higher prices for motorists in some parts of the country. But if CD&R and Morrisons are able to address these concerns then we won’t need to move on to an in-depth investigation of the merger.” In practice, this could mean CD&R offering to sell petrol stations in areas where the CMA believes consumers could be adversely affected. Petrol hit a fresh high this week. Figures from the data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on Tuesday was 167.3p, while diesel was 179.7p. Experts have said the continued war in Ukraine could lead to petrol soaring towards £2.50, while diesel could go as high as £3. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, cut fuel duty by 5p in his spring statement on Wednesday. CD&R has been approached for comment.",News/Business,Watchdog raises petrol price concerns over Morrisons takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/24/watchdog-raises-petrol-price-concerns-over-morrisons-takeover
3/24/2022,"Boris Johnson has described Russian plans to host the 2028 men’s European Championships as “beyond satire” and recommended the tournament be hosted by Ukraine, despite the UK and Ireland’s joint bid. The prime minister was speaking in Brussels, where he is to attend a Nato summit addressing Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. On Wednesday Russia expressed a declaration of interest in hosting the 2028 or 2032 Euros. “I think that the idea of Russia holding any idea of football tournament or any kind of cultural event right now is beyond satire,” Johnson said. “I can’t believe that anybody would seriously consider their suggestion and, yes, I think the best thing possible would be for the entire Russian forces to retire forthwith from Ukraine and hand the tournament to them, of course.” Johnson had been replying to a direct question over whether it would be better for Ukraine to host the Euros than Russia, but he apparently failed to recall that his own country had bid for the tournament and that he had tweeted in support of it. On Wednesday, a message from Johnson’s official account read: “The UK and Ireland bid for the UEFA Euro 2028 has this government’s full backing. “Our world-class stadiums and passionate fans stand ready to host one of the world’s greatest sporting events. Let’s bring football home.” Last year, Johnson’s government gave £2.8m to UK football associations to explore a bid for the 2030 World Cup, with Johnson vocally supportive of the decision. He was reported to have lobbied the president of Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, over the bid but the process ended with a decision to apply for the European Championship instead after finding “many areas of uncertainty” in a World Cup push. Allying with Ireland, the five nations’ bid is the favourite to secure the 2028 tournament. The Russian expression of interest was received coldly by Uefa, which warned that the country could receive further sanctions should a full bid go ahead. Russian teams are banned from Uefa competition at international and club level, and Fifa has removed the country from the qualifying process for this winter’s World Cup in Qatar.",Sport/Football,Boris Johnson calls for Ukraine to host Euro 2028 despite UK-Ireland bid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/boris-johnson-calls-for-ukraine-to-host-euro-2028-despite-uk-ireland-bid-russia
3/24/2022,"Good morning. The US has formally accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine and vowed to pursue accountability “using every tool available”. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, said the US had reached its conclusion using public and intelligence sources. He said that “as with any alleged crime”, a court with jurisdiction would be “ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases”, and the US would continue its efforts to gather evidence. Last week Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a “war criminal”, triggering backlash from the Kremlin. Blinken did not give details of specific incidents that the state department considered to be war crimes, but listed attacks on “apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers and ambulances.” Biden has arrived in Europe for an emergency Nato summit, a G7 summit and a meeting of the European Council in Brussels. He aims to keep pressure high on Russia. A Russian reporter has died amid Russian shelling in Kyiv. Oksana Baulina, who was reporting for the independent Russian news website the Insider, was at least the fifth journalist to die since the conflict began. Seven humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians have been agreed for Thursday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said. Many previous agreements have fallen apart. None have been agreed for Mariupol. The Alabama Republican congressman Mo Brooks has said Donald Trump asked him to “rescind” the 2020 election, remove Joe Biden from the White House and reinstate Trump. Brooks’s statement follows Trump withdrawing his endorsement of Brooks for insufficiently supporting his lie about electoral fraud. Brooks, who until had now been one of Trump’s strongest supporters, said his refusal to toe the line resulted in him losing the former president’s backing. “President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 election, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,” he said. “As a lawyer, I’ve repeatedly advised President Trump that 6 January was the final election contest verdict and neither the US constitution nor the US code permit what President Trump asks. Period.” When did Trump withdraw his endorsement? On Wednesday Trump said Brooks “made a horrible mistake recently when he went ‘woke’ and stated, referring to the 2020 Presidential Election Scam: ‘Put that behind you, put that behind you.’” Meanwhile, a man charged in 6 January attack has been granted asylum in Belarus. Charged with assaulting police, Evan Neumann said that although he had been in the building, he rejected the charges and had not hit any officers. Washington has joined nine other states in restricting magazine capacity size after the governor, Jay Inslee, signed a package of bills tightening the state’s gun laws. “We are not willing to accept gun violence as a normal part of life in the state of Washington,” said Inslee, a Democrat. The measure bans the manufacture, distribution and sale of firearm magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Members of the public were not permitted in the capitol for several hours before and after the bill signing as a “prudent precaution”, according to a spokesperson for the Washington state patrol. When does it come into effect? 1 July 2022. Are there exceptions? The measure does not prohibit the possession of these magazines and allows them to be used by law enforcement and corrections officers, members of the armed forces, Washington’s national guard and licensed firearms dealers. Madeleine Albright, the first female US secretary of state, has died at the age of 84. Albright, who came to the US as a refugee and served under Bill Clinton, died of cancer, her family said. Colombia could elect its first black female vice-president after the leftist frontrunner for president, Gustavo Petro, picked Francia Márquez to be his running mate. Márquez is an environmental campaigner who has survived at least one assassination attempt. A group of Republicans in Wisconsin are pursuing an illegal effort to undo the 2020 election. Despite the anti-democratic measures they promote, partisan gerrymandering means they are unlikely to lose control of the state assembly this fall. Potentially dangerous PFAS chemicals have been identified in scores of packaging products from US restaurant and grocery chains, a Consumer Reports investigation has found. CR tested multiple samples of 118 food packaging products and found evidence of the “forever chemicals” PFAS in more than half, while almost a third contained levels above a threshold supported by CR experts and others. Port Freeport in Texas has obtained 95% of property in the historically Black neighborhood of East End as part of a sweeping expansion. For 97-year-old Henry Jones, this means being pushed out the house he called home for more than 70 years. “What I accumulated, I thought I would enjoy it and my family [would] inherit it,” Jones says. “Now, everything’s going to pieces while I’m here.” The world’s forests limit the climate crisis in more ways than just by storing carbon, research shows.

3/24/2022,"If you’ve ever sighed “Ahhh” at a flock of young lambs and then gone off to gnaw on some of their shanks for your lunch, you’re a living example of the meat paradox. Animals elicit empathy and we don’t wish them harm. But the vast majority of us still kill and eat them, or at least kill their male young and take their milk. Rob Percival, head of policy at the Soil Association, sets out to unpack this paradox in a discomfiting book that delves into our complicated relationship with meat. Percival takes as his cue a 2016 paper by the psychologists Brock Bastian and Steve Loughnan that focuses on the dissonance this love/eat relationship creates. Human beings are not short of strategies to deal with it. Farmers imagine an implicit contract in which we look after animals and they in return give us their corpses. The North American Cree tell themselves that the reindeer give themselves to the hunter out of generosity. For most consumers the most effective tactic is simply not to think about it. This is especially useful if the animals you eat are reared in intensive factory farms. You really don’t want to be thinking of a sow who can’t even turn in her crate when tucking into a bacon sandwich. “It’s not that we eat lots of industrially farmed meat because we are ignorant of what really happens,” says Percival, “rather we are wilfully ignorant because we eat lots of meat.” He challenges many of the claims made by those who think they can escape the paradox by simply avoiding meat and dairy. He picks apart the idea that a natural human diet is vegan. For the past 1.8m years – since the time of Homo erectus – meat has formed an important part of our diets, and until recently we just couldn’t have got the iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and fatty acids we needed without it. However, Percival is not always so rational. At one point he announces that “there is a word for what we do to these animals, those that we consume. Murder.” A whole chapter on “murder” follows, yet he never provides an argument for why this is the right word to use for animal slaughter. He doesn’t seriously consider the possibility that there is no irresolvable paradox after all, just an uncomfortable tension, as there always is in the interdependence of life and death. So when he meets Alex, a farmer who says, “I can rear an animal with love, and I can kill it,” he just doesn’t know what to make of him. Alex challenges Percival’s claim that “the dissonance generated by the paradox is too potent to be processed”. Perhaps that’s why Percival comes to no clear conclusion about whether we should still be eating meat today. Still, his provocative book presents a challenge that most haven’t even begun to confront – and few are ready to meet.

3/24/2022,"Helsinki has a small and sensible tram system, except for the wonderful SpåraKoff “pub” tram: a bright red single carriage that loops around the city, serving mostly beer and “long drink” (gin and grapefruit soda; please, try the long drink) to passengers. It covers most of the usual sights in town and without any annoying commentary. The seats aren’t particularly comfy and the decor is mostly wood but you’re on a tram, with beer, so already having the best afternoon/evening of the week. For Helsinki, drinks are reasonably priced at less than €8 a pint and there’s an ever-changing wine list. Just to make it extra special, it has a toilet, so you might never need to leave.Gavin The trams on Hong Kong Island are affectionately known as “ding dings” and run down the main road arteries for more than 13km, west to east, between Kennedy Town and Shau Kei Wan. To drift along this urban canyon’s length takes about two hours and costs 25p, and the sights are unending. From the windows of towering residential monoliths in every pastel shade, satellite dishes and air con units strain outwards for light. Below, cardboard trolleys and shining automobilia are shunted through the narrow streets, lit by retail neon. From the slightest cracks jungle trees leap up, coalescing in parks. Float by the Bank of China and HSBC towers. There’s no better way to relax in the world’s most manic city.Culann Robinson The tram runs between the hills at Villa Opicina near the Slovenian border and the lovely Adriatic city of Trieste, about 6km away. It becomes a funicular using cables to help navigate the steepest sections. The views are wonderful, the experience is unusual and you have the opportunity to visit two countries in one trip. The tramway has been closed since August 2016, following an accident, but the authorities are hopeful that, after several scandals and mishaps, the line will reopen this year. I can’t wait to return and enjoy a ride, followed by beautiful food and wine in one of Trieste’s old squares.Jennifer Cutler While they’re not quite urban icons in the way that trams often are, New Orleans’ characterful streetcars are undoubtedly the best way to explore the city’s charming scenery and rich history. Board the vintage streetcar on the outskirts of the French Quarter where Common Street meets St Charles Avenue, and make yourself comfortable on the mahogany seats. The St Charles line (the oldest continuously operated streetcar line in the world, having opened in 1835) takes passengers through Uptown and the eye-catching Garden District, passing iconic mansions, parks, museums and enticing local shops. For $1.25, this old-fashioned experience is well worth the money.Hamish Lister If you have ever taken the train between Dresden and Prague, then you may have already noticed the gorgeous rock formations of the Elbe Sandstone mountains along the Elbe River valley in the so-called Saxon Switzerland of Germany. The 8km-long Kirnitzschtalbahn or the Kirnitsch Valley Tramway runs between the spa town of Bad Schandau and the Lichtenhain waterfall. The tram will take you up to the waterfall or to various access points for hiking throughout the region – the Malerweg or Painters’ Way has inspired generations of artists. The tram’s final stop is home to the delightfully kitsch, half-timber Lichtenhainer Wasserfall hotel, which offers hikers and vintage tram enthusiasts alike a well-earned beer or, if you prefer, kaffee und kuchen.Robby Block Catch the yellow line to Meadowhall for £4.60 return.

We took the No 1, which has a stunningly scenic route from Rebeira to Foz overlooking the Douro River the whole way. The route does get busy and runs roughly every half an hour. You can go earlier in the day or wait for the next one, like we did. It costs €3.50 one way, or a bit more return – you can use contactless to pay on the tram. When at Foz it’s lovely to watch the mighty waves crash and admire the beautiful lighthouse.Joy This ancient city’s extensive tram routes, built in the second half of the 19th century and electrified in 1902, are the best way to sample the life, colour and people of Alexandria. For 5p one can have a 90-minute trip through the old areas of the city including the harbours and out to the eastern suburbs. Each carriage has its own conductor and the first one in the blue tram is reserved for women. The conductor squeezes his way through the passengers issuing tickets. Sellers of merchandise all pass through, plying their wares. Outside, the business of Alexandria is conducted on, and next to, the tram lines.

3/24/2022,"Microplastic pollution has been detected in human blood for the first time, with scientists finding the tiny particles in almost 80% of the people tested. The discovery shows the particles can travel around the body and may lodge in organs. The impact on health is as yet unknown. But researchers are concerned as microplastics cause damage to human cells in the laboratory and air pollution particles are already known to enter the body and cause millions of early deaths a year. Huge amounts of plastic waste are dumped in the environment and microplastics now contaminate the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People were already known to consume the tiny particles via food and water as well as breathing them in, and they have been found in the faeces of babies and adults. The scientists analysed blood samples from 22 anonymous donors, all healthy adults and found plastic particles in 17. Half the samples contained PET plastic, which is commonly used in drinks bottles, while a third contained polystyrene, used for packaging food and other products. A quarter of the blood samples contained polyethylene, from which plastic carrier bags are made. “Our study is the first indication that we have polymer particles in our blood – ​it’s a breakthrough result,” said Prof Dick Vethaak, an ecotoxicologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. “But we have to extend the research and increase the sample sizes, the number of polymers assessed, etc.” Further studies by a number of groups are already under way, he said. “It is certainly reasonable to be concerned,” Vethaak told the Guardian. “The particles are there and are transported throughout the body.” He said previous work had shown that microplastics were 10 times higher in the faeces of babies compared with adults and that babies fed with plastic bottles are swallowing millions of microplastic particles a day. “We also know in general that babies and young children are more vulnerable to chemical and particle exposure,” he said. “That worries me a lot.” The new research is published in the journal Environment International and adapted existing techniques to detect and analyse particles as small as 0.0007mm. Some of the blood samples contained two or three types of plastic. The team used steel syringe needles and glass tubes to avoid contamination, and tested for background levels of microplastics using blank samples. Vethaak acknowledged that the amount and type of plastic varied considerably between the blood samples. “But this is a pioneering study,” he said, with more work now needed. He said the differences might reflect short-term exposure before the blood samples were taken, such as drinking from a plastic-lined coffee cup, or wearing a plastic face mask. “The big question is what is happening in our body?” Vethaak said. “Are the particles retained in the body? Are they transported to certain organs, such as getting past the blood-brain barrier?” And are these levels sufficiently high to trigger disease? We urgently need to fund further research so we can find out.” The new research was funded by the Dutch National Organisation for Health Research and Development and Common Seas, a social enterprise working to reduce plastic pollution. “Plastic production is set to double by 2040,” said Jo Royle, founder of the charity Common Seas. “We have a right to know what all this plastic is doing to our bodies.” Common Seas, along with more than 80 NGOs, scientists and MPs, are asking the UK government to allocate £15m to research on the human health impacts of plastic. The EU is already funding research on the impact of microplastic on foetuses and babies, and on the immune system. A recent study found that microplastics can latch on to the outer membranes of red blood cells and may limit their ability to transport oxygen. The particles have also been found in the placentas of pregnant women, and in pregnant rats they pass rapidly through the lungs into the hearts, brains and other organs of the foetuses. A new review paper published on Tuesday, co-authored by Vethaak, assessed cancer risk and concluded: “More detailed research on how micro- and nano-plastics affect the structures and processes of the human body, and whether and how they can transform cells and induce carcinogenesis, is urgently needed, particularly in light of the exponential increase in plastic production. The problem is becoming more urgent with each day.”",News/Environment,Microplastics found in human blood for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time
3/24/2022,"The ruler of Dubai will have no face-to-face contact with his two children from his marriage to Princess Haya nor any substantive say in their upbringing, after a long-running court battle between the former couple and a series of damning judgments about his “abusive behaviour”. Concluding more than two and a half years of legal proceedings, which began when Haya fled to the UK with the children in April 2019, the president of the family division of the high court in England and Wales said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum had “consistently displayed coercive and controlling behaviour with respect to those members of his family who he regards as behaving contrary to his will”. In a written judgment, Sir Andrew McFarlane ruled that Haya would have sole responsibility for decisions relating to the children’s medical care and schooling. He said the Dubai ruler, who is also prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, a close Gulf ally of Britain, had inflicted “domestic abuse” on an extraordinary scale against his ex-wife, which had emotional and psychologically harmed their children and would continue to do so if she were required to gain approval for matters involving their wellbeing. At the outset of proceedings, Sheikh Mohammed had sought the return of Jalila, now 14, and Zayed, now 10, to Dubai. But McFarlane said that since October 2019 the Dubai ruler had accepted that the children would remain living with their mother in England and, on 1 December last year had announced that he would no longer pursue direct contact with them. This change of heart followed damning judgments by McFarlane which determined, on the balance of probabilities, that: Sheikh Mohammed orchestrated the abductions and confinement of two of his other children, Princess Latifa and Princess Shamsa – in the latter case from the streets of Cambridge – and subjected Haya to a campaign of “harassment and intimidation”. He hacked the phones of Haya and five of her associates, including two of her lawyers, using NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware while the couple were locked in court proceedings. His agents attempted to buy a £30m estate next door to Haya’s Berkshire home in a “very significant threat to her security”, while publicly denying they were doing so. In the latest judgment, published on Thursday, McFarlane noted Sheikh Mohammed’s failure to attend or play a part in any of the many court hearings, instead relying on his lawyers, and his “absence of any acceptance of responsibility, expression of remorse or understanding of the impact of this behaviour on the mother” and failure to acknowledge Haya’s good parenting. Describing the co-parenting relationship as “entirely bankrupt”, he wrote: “The children are being harmed by the degree to which their mother is compromised emotionally and in terms of the time and focus she has been able to give to them because of the need to engage with all of the issues that have preoccupied her these last three years, and by the impact that the need constantly to engage with the demands of this court process has had on her. “The harm to the children from all of these factors will, I am clear, continue if she is, in the future, required to communicate with his highness to gain his approval for matters, even serious matters, relating to the children’s health, education or psychological wellbeing.” In oral evidence, Haya, who last year was awarded a potentially record-breaking divorce settlement that could exceed £500m to protect her and their children from the sheikh, said: “To look forward to shared parental responsibility with somebody who cannot even see you as a parent, or bear to mention your name on paper, does not feel like that there is anything shared about it.” McFarlane said a series of legal challenges, including appeals, brought by the sheikh’s lawyers, while legitimate, were a manifestation of a desire to “coerce and control” Haya and prevent or curtail the court’s investigations. He added: “His highness’s behaviour towards the mother, in each of its separate manifestations, whether by threats, poems, coordinating press reports, covertly arranging to purchase property immediately overlooking hers, phone hacking or in the conduct of this litigation, has been abusive to a high, indeed exorbitant, degree.” The result of the judgment is that Sheikh Mohammed will be limited to “indirect contact” with his children, for example by phone or via messaging apps. McFarlane said the explicit naming of children in a welfare judgment appeared to be unprecedented but Haya and Jalila favoured publication and it would “remove the potential for conjecture, manipulation and/or falsehood” by the sheikh or those acting for him with respect to the children’s welfare.",News/World news,Dubai ruler to have no direct contact with two children after UK court battle,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/uk-court-bars-dubai-ruler-from-face-to-face-contact-with-two-children
3/24/2022,"A record 29.3m items of child abuse imagery were found and removed across the internet in 2021, according to data from the US nonprofit organisation in charge of coordinating reports on the matter. The figure released by the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) is a 35% increase from 2020. The centre said the increase in reports was not necessarily cause for alarm and could represent an improvement on the part of platforms. “Higher numbers of reports can be indicative of a variety of things including larger numbers of users on a platform or how robust an ESP’s [electronic service provider’s] efforts are to identify and remove abusive content,” it said. “NCMEC applauds ESPs that make identifying and reporting this content a priority and encourages all companies to increase their reporting to NCMEC. These reports are critical to helping remove children from harmful situations and to stopping further victimisation.” The overwhelming majority of reports made to NCMEC came from Facebook. There were 22m pieces of child abuse imagery reported from Facebook alone, and for the first time data was broken out for its owner Meta’s other products, revealing that Instagram made 3.3m reports and WhatsApp 1.3m. Google made 875,783 reports and Snap 512,522. The adult social network OnlyFans was represented on the list for the first time, with its owner, Fenix International, making 2,984 reports in 2021. Some companies were conspicuous by their tiny footprint. Apple, despite running a messaging platform and a photo-sharing service, found and reported just 160 pieces of child abuse imagery over the period. Andy Burrows, the NSPCC’s head of child safety online policy, said: “The record number of child abuse reports received by NCMEC last year is yet another reminder of the scale of offending now taking place online and the risks children continue to be exposed to when using social media. “With the online safety bill starting its journey through parliament, it is imperative politicians take this opportunity to forge the strongest possible piece of legislation which will protect children from preventable harm and stifle grooming and the sharing of child sexual abuse images.” The report highlights the complexity of discussions around prevention of harm to children online. End-to-end encryption, which prevents platforms from reading the contents of messages between their users, has come under attack from the government on the grounds that it hampers efforts to fight child abuse. But the data tells two stories on the topic. Comparing the reports from WhatsApp and Facebook, which have a similar number of users, suggests that the technology may indeed hide millions of cases of abuse; while comparing the reports from WhatsApp and Apple, both of which offer end-to-end encrypted messaging services, shows how much companies can do to root out abuse even within those limits. Antigone Davis, the global head of safety at Meta, said: “We report the most content because we work hardest to find and remove it. It’s part of our longstanding commitment to protecting children online, but we cannot do this alone. It is time others in the industry invest more so we can work together to prevent the spread of this heinous content. We’ve made detection technology available to all technology companies because it’s going to take investment from everyone in our industry to prevent this harm.” Snap declined to comment. OnlyFans and Apple did not reply to requests for comment.",News/Technology,Sites reported record 29.3m child abuse images in 2021 ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/24/sites-reported-record-293m-child-abuse-images-in-2021
3/24/2022,"North Korea has launched what is thought to be its largest intercontinental ballistic missile to date, according to military officials in Japan and South Korea, in what would be the regime’s most serious provocation for years. South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said it had detected the launch of an “unidentified projectile” from North Korea on Thursday afternoon. South Korea said the launch was assumed to be a long-range missile, possibly an ICBM fired on a lofted trajectory, the Yonhap news agency reported. If that is confirmed, it would be the first full-capability launch of the regime’s largest missiles since 2017, and a sign that it has made significant progress in developing weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads anywhere in the US. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, described the launch as “reckless”, while the state minister of defence, Makoto Oniki, said the missile was possibly a new type of ICBM. Oniki said the missile had flown for about an hour before landing inside Japan’s exclusive economic zone [EEZ] about 90 miles west of the Oshima peninsula on Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island, at 3.35pm local time. There were no reports of damage to aircraft or vessels in the area. “At a time when the world is dealing with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, North Korea is pressing ahead with launches that unilaterally aggravate provocations against the international community, which is absolutely unforgivable,” Oniki said. Analysts say the unprecedented frequency of missile tests this year is a clear signal that Kim Jong-un is determined to cement North Korea’s status as a nuclear power, enabling the country’s leader to approach any future nuclear talks with the US from a position of strength. “Despite economic challenges and technical setbacks, the Kim regime is determined to advance its missile capabilities,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “It would be a mistake for international policymakers to think the North Korean missile threat can be put on the back burner while the world deals with the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The Kyodo news agency quoted Japanese government sources as saying that the missile had flown for 71 minutes to a range of 684 miles from its launch site, reaching an altitude of 3,700 miles. No previous North Korean missile had flown for that long or reached that altitude, Japan’s defence ministry said. The suspected launch of an ICBM came as the US president, Joe Biden, and other G7 leaders prepared to meet in Brussels to discuss the war in Ukraine. But Pyongyang’s first full test-firing of an ICBM since 2017 is certain to draw condemnation from the US and its allies. South Korea’s defence ministry did not immediately confirm whether the test involved an ICBM, while the country’s military said it had been fired from North Korea’s east coast towards the East Sea, which is also known as the Sea of Japan. South Korea’s outgoing president, Moon Jae-in, called a meeting of the national security council, the presidential Blue House said. “The president seriously urged North Korea to immediately halt actions that create tension and return to the path of diplomatic settlement through conversations as soon as possible,” the presidential office said in a statement. The launch will present Moon’s successor, Yoon Suk-yeol, with a considerable policy challenge when he takes office in early May. North Korea has conducted 13 rounds of weapons launches this year, including one on 16 March in which a suspected missile exploded above the capital, Pyongyang, shortly after launch. The volley of tests fuelled speculation that Kim was gearing up for the launch of a larger weapon theoretically capable of reaching the US mainland. US officials said the North had used two launches, on 27 February and 5 March, to evaluate components belonging to its largest ICBM system yet – the Hwasong-17 – before conducting another test at full range. North Korea’s official media insisted that the two successful tests were aimed at developing cameras and other systems for a spy satellite. Experts said a full Hwasong-17 launch could coincide with the 110th anniversary of the birth of North Korea’s founder, and Kim Jong-un’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, on 15 April. North Korea has carried out three full ICBM tests, with the most recent, in November 2017, involving a new type of ICBM called a Hwasong-15. The regime claimed the missile was able to reach the entire US mainland. Kim suspended missile launches during several rounds of nuclear diplomacy with Donald Trump in 2018, although their three meetings failed to make any progress on dismantling the North’s nuclear arsenal. With little prospect for a return to nuclear talks with the Biden administration, North Korea hinted at the start of the year that it could break its self-imposed moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests. “If today’s launch turns out to be an ICBM, it would signal an end to the moratorium. That’s for sure,” said Go Myong-hyun, a senior researcher at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. The Hwasong-17, which is “considerably larger” than the Hwasong-15, was unveiled at a predawn military parade in October 2020 and displayed a second time at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang in October last year.",News/World news,North Korea test-launches its ‘largest intercontinental ballistic missile yet’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/north-korea-test-launches-its-largest-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-yet
