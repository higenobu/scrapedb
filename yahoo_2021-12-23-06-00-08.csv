12/23/2021,"Gary Edwards, of Pennsylvania, was sentenced to a year of probation in the January 6 Capitol riot. He was arrested earlier this year after his wife made Facebook posts about his participation. His wife said at his sentencing that she never ""dreamed"" a Facebook post would be used against him, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. A woman whose bragging Facebook posts led to her husband's arrest for participating in the January 6 Capitol riot said at his sentencing on Monday that she never expected her social media comments would be used against him. Gary Edwards, of Churchville, Pennsylvania, was sentenced to a year of probation on Monday and ordered to pay a $2,500 fine and $500 in restitution for his role in the insurrection, according to court filings seen by Insider. At Edwards' sentencing, his wife, Lyn Edwards, told a judge that she was ""express[ing] off the cuff"" when she wrote about her husband's experience inside the Capitol in now-deleted Facebook posts to friends, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. ""Never in my life could I have dreamed that something I posted on Facebook would be used against my husband, would lead him to be arrested,"" she said in court, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. According to the FBI, Lyn Edwards' first Facebook post about the riot started out with: ""Okay ladies let me tell you what happened as my husband was there inside the Capitol Rotunda."" She went on to say her husband chatted with police, walked around carrying flags, and witnessed people singing the national anthem. ""These were people who watched their rights being taken away, their votes stolen from them, their state officials violating the constitutions of their country, and people who are not being given the opportunity to be able to have evidence shown,"" she said in one post, according to the FBI. Screenshots of her Facebook posts were later sent to the FBI by an anonymous tipster, the FBI said. Lyn Edwards told the judge that she later watched a New York Times video of the riot ""in horror"" and wished she had been in Washington, DC, with her husband on the day of the insurrection, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""In our relationship, I am the one who is much more observant and alert to my surroundings,"" she said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Gary Edwards pleaded guilty in September. The FBI has used the internet to find rioters, asking for the public's help to identify them in January. Social media sleuths identifying and outing Capitol rioters online have led to numerous arrests. A New York man was arrested and charged for his alleged involvement in the riot after a woman sent the FBI screenshots from the dating app Bumble showing him saying he stormed the Capitol, Insider reported. A Michigan man was arrested in December after he bragged about his participation in the riot on social media, the Department of Justice said. Facebook was a hub for social media users planning the attack on the Capitol, according to an internal report reviewed by Buzzfeed News. Members of pro-Trump Facebook groups including ""Stop the Steal,"" which amassed more than 365,000 users before it was banned for making ""worrying calls for violence,"" contributed to the Capitol riot, according to the report.

12/23/2021,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch prosecutors on Tuesday said three Russians and a Ukrainian were 'fully responsible' for shooting down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Eastern Ukraine in 2014 and should be found guilty of murder. The men - all of whom remain at large - could face sentences of up to life imprisonment if found guilty of helping to supply the missile system used by Russian-backed rebels to fire a rocket at the passenger jet as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. ""The four suspects together are fully responsible for shooting down flight MH17, which caused the death of the 298 people on board, and the murder of those on board,"" prosecutor Thijs Berger told judges. In the second day of presenting their closing arguments, the prosecution said the evidence showed that the suspects -- Russians Oleg Pulatov, Sergey Dubinsky and Igor Girkin and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko -- pulled the strings in the area where MH17 was shot down. The four were identified by a special international Joint Investigative Team which looked into the crash of flight MH17 and were later named by Dutch prosecutors. According to prosecutors, the men, who are all linked to Russian-backed rebel groups, made the shooting down of MH17 possible by arranging for a Russian-made Buk missile to be brought to the area. Under Dutch law it does not matter that the suspects did not ultimately pull the trigger, because someone who makes someone else commit a crime can be convicted as a perpetrator of that crime, prosecutors said. A sentencing demand is expected on Wednesday at the end of the 20-month trial. None of the defendants were present in court. One suspect, Pulatov, has sent lawyers to represent him. The others have never cooperated with the court and are being tried in absentia.

12/23/2021,"Stephanie Duncan stood before Judge Bradford Charles in Lebanon County court Wednesday saying the prolonged assault and abuse she inflicted on five adopted children in her care ""would forever be her fault."" ""I wish I could go back a long time ago, and not try to adopt children or put them in our home,"" she said. The North Annville resident plead guilty in October for abuse that included physical punishment and deprivation of food, water, heat and bathroom privileges, according to police. Duncan received an aggregate sentence Wednesday of 17 to 47 years in a state correctional facility. She is also to have not contact with any children for the entirety of her sentence. Children by definition are dependent upon those that call themselves parents, but Charles said what Duncan did to these five children was clearly torture. ""These children were tortured, and in some ways they they were tortured worse than any prisoner of war was tortured by an opposing military force,"" he said. Charges include aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a child and tampering with or fabricating physical evidence. Duncan Pleads Guilty: North Annville mother Stephanie Duncan pleads guilty in torture of five adopted children 'No regard for humanity': 'No regard for humanity': Lebanon judge unmoved by apology from father of 5 tortured kids Child abuse:Max Schollenberger was found dead by police a year ago. Has anything changed since then? On Jan. 13, the Lebanon County Detective Bureau opened an investigation into Duncan and her husband, Robert, after their 11-year-old son was rushed to Hershey Medical Center after he was found to be unresponsive and hypothermic. ""An examination of (the boy's) body revealed bruises on his neck, shoulders, back, abdomen, hip, and genitals,"" according to a news release from the district attorney's office. ""The medical staff determined the location of the child's bruises were not consistent with accidental injury."" The medical team determined the child was suffering from extreme hypothermia caused by prolonged exposure to extreme cold. At Duncan's sentencing hearing, Lebanon District Attorney Pier Hess Graf said, ""If there is any doubt that this a diabolical, evil, malicious woman,"" one would only have to look at her actions dealing with the 11-year-old's medical condition. ""She doesn't call 911, she doesn't rush him to the hospital right away,"" Graf said in court. ""She drags that poor little boy up a flight of stairs, throws him in a shower, and as he's vomiting she tries to make him eat food and drink water so nobody would find out how bad it is."" The North Annville couple tortured all of the children they had adopted in calculated and prolonged ways. This included physical punishment, depriving them of food and water and heat and bathroom privileges, and trying to cover up their crimes. ""Any time that the children, in her mind, didn't apply by her rules, she came up with a financial cost,"" Graf said in court. ""So if they were clumsy and broke a bowl, if they left a light on, if they did something to displease her ... and to earn that cost back they had to do chores. That could be running up and down stairs for hours at a time in blazing hot weather. They could be sitting outside in blazing hot weather not being allowed to move."" All of the children's bedrooms had cameras and were monitored by the Duncans day and night. The 11-year-old is shown spending every night alone, cold and clothed only in a diaper in his empty room. Graf said that for each adopted child, the Duncans received financial subsidies. The Duncans would exaggerate mental health conditions for the children, which gave the parents additional money. ""We are talking tens of thousands of dollars per year to allegedly care for these kids,"" she said. ""It's the most disgusting set of circumstances I can possibly envision. Especially since (Duncan) ... worked at Philhaven, so she certainly knew how to work her way around the mental health system, and what to report and what to get for it."" On Jan. 15, the Lebanon County Children and Youth Agency obtained a court order granting the agency custody of the children, who were then removed from the Duncan's home. Graf said officials had multiple conversations with the children regarding the sentencing of the Duncans. The children were not present at Stephanie Duncan's sentencing Wednesday. ""All of the in-person interviews describe Stephanie Duncan as the main perpetrator,"" she said. During his sentencing before Charles on Oct. 13, Robert Duncan apologized for his role in the prolonged assault of the children. ""I recognized the nature of what I have done ... and I was wrong,"" he said. Robert Duncan received an aggregate sentence of 6 to 30 years in a state correctional facility. He is also to have no contact, direct or indirect, with any of the children. ""I have always been taught my entire life to believe that there is no sin that is unforgivable,"" Charles told Stephanie Duncan at her sentencing Wednesday. ""I'll tell you what, this comes pretty damn close."" The Department of Human Services operates a 24/7 hotline about the welfare of a child and to report suspected child abuse.
