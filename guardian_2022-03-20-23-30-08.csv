3/20/2022,"For a while it felt so far away: listening to your favourite artist, pints flying overhead, queueing for portable toilets, losing your friends and finding new ones. But after two years of cancellations and delays, music lovers can once again look forward to an array of festivals and gigs this summer. From Paul McCartney at Glastonbury and Tyler, the Creator at Parklife, to Adele and Elton John at BST Hyde Park and Liam Gallagher at the Etihad Stadium, there’s something in the music calendar for everyone. “Summer 2022 marks the beginning of the next era of the musical summer season,” said Emily Eavis, co-organiser of Glastonbury festival, which is returning in June for the first time since 2019. Alongside headliners McCartney, Kendrick Lamar and Billie Eilish, the festival has announced more than 80 names so far, including Olivia Rodrigo and Diana Ross. “All gigs are back, festivals will return with bells on and people will be streaming through many gates all summer long full of excitement,” Eavis said. “It’s a huge relief that these life-affirming gatherings are back, and it feels like we have actually turned a corner in this long, difficult pandemic trajectory. We can’t wait to welcome people back to Worthy Farm.” Not only has music helped shape Britain’s identity, but the UK music industry contributed £5.8bn to the economy pre-pandemic, according to UK Music, the umbrella organisation representing the commercial music industry from artists and record labels to the live music sector. The industry now has the potential to play a key role in the nation’s recovery from the pandemic. “Live music is emerging from a Covid-enforced hibernation that saw around a third of jobs right across the music industry wiped out and many stages empty for almost two years,” said the UK Music chief executive, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin. “The absence of live music left a big hole in many people’s lives and helped us realise the power of music when it comes to lifting people’s spirits and having fun. “It’s been an awful two years for the whole industry – but there is now a cautious optimism that we’ve turned a corner and everyone is determined to deliver the best summer of festivals and gigs ever.” Other hugely popular acts billed this year include Ed Sheeran and AJ Tracey at Radio 1’s Big Weekend, a stadium tour by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Rolling Stones at BST Hyde Park, Muse at Isle of Wight and Iron Maiden at Download. “It very much feels like the return is very real and its significance for us as promoters, but also for artists and attendees, is huge,” said Melvin Benn, the managing director of Festival Republic, which is behind some of the UK’s biggest festivals including Latitude, Wilderness, Reading and Leeds and Wireless. Though a significant number of festivals – including Creamfields, Parklife, Tramlines and Reading and Leeds – returned last year, there is a heady feeling of ceremony about this summer, as all restrictions seem to be firmly in the past. Alongside the huge, staple events, countless grassroots festivals and concerts are popping up nationwide. Ben Cross, the founder of Cloud X, an entertainment company that operates a record label and runs live events, including the Cloud X festival which launched last year, said: “This summer in Britain is going to be absolutely amazing. “The pandemic highlighted the importance of not only recognising but investing in and celebrating underrepresented communities. Being able to continue this mission feels liberating. Roll on the summer of love.” According to data from the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), more than 50% of UK festivals with capacity of 5,000 and over cancelled or postponed in 2021, after the season was wiped out by Covid in 2020. Paul Reed, the chief executive of AIF, said: “We are certain, at this stage, that summer 2022 will see a full return to the fields but we still need support to aid this recovery. “That’s why we have repeatedly called on government to maintain the current reduced 12.5% rate on tickets beyond the end of March. It remains a very challenging time for festival organisers, with pressures along the supply chain, loss of skilled workforce, Brexit complications around movement of artists and crew, and a 20-30% increase in infrastructure costs across the board.” UK Music has also urged the chancellor to ditch the “hugely damaging” VAT hike on concert and live event tickets that is due to kick in on 1 April – a move that promoters and music industry chiefs are concerned could force a rise in ticket prices. “The demand for tickets this year is significant, so all of my shows are in a really strong position,” Benn said. “But unless the government extend the VAT break we will definitely not make up what we lost in 2020 and to a lesser extent 2021.”",Arts/Culture,‘Roll on the summer of love’: UK music festivals on song after Covid closures,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/20/roll-on-the-summer-of-love-uk-music-festivals-on-song-after-covid-closures
3/20/2022,"Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow’s forces bombed an art school in Mariupol where more than 400 people had taken shelter, amid further reports that civilians from the devastated southern city were being forcibly transported to Russia. Days after Russian shells struck a theatre in the city also being used as a shelter, local authorities said Mariupol’s G12 art school had been destroyed while women, children and elderly people were inside. There was no immediate word on casualties. As Moscow claimed on Sunday it had fired a hypersonic missile against Ukraine for the second time, the country’s human rights spokesperson, Ludmila Denisova, accused its forces of kidnapping Mariupol residents and taking them to Russia. “In recent days, several thousand Mariupol residents have been deported to Russia,” Denisova said on Telegram. After processing at “filtration camps”, some were then transported to the Russian city of Taganrog, about 100km from Mariupol, and from there sent by rail “to various economically depressed cities in Russia”, she said. Denisova said Ukrainian citizens had been “issued papers that require them to be in a certain city. They have no right to leave it for at least two years with the obligation to work at the specified place of work. The fate of others remains unknown.” Russian news agencies have said hundreds of people Moscow calls refugees have been bussed from Mariupol to Russia. Denisova said the “abductions and forced displacements” violated the Geneva conventions and the European convention on human rights and called on the international community to “respond … and increase sanctions against the terrorist state of the Russian Federation”. In a separate post, Denisova said 56 elderly people in the town of Kreminna in the Luhansk region had died after a Russian tank “cynically and purposefully fired at a home for the elderly”. Fifteen survivors were “abducted by the occupiers”, she said, calling the attack “another act of horrific genocide”. A total of 6,623 civilians were evacuated on Saturday along humanitarian corridors, including 4,000 from Mariupol, authorities said on Sunday, with Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, adding that seven safe routes would again be open on Sunday to enable civilians to leave frontline areas. More than 3.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine to escape the Russian onslaught in Europe’s fastest growing refugee crisis since the second world war, the UN has said, with another 6.5 million thought to be displaced inside the country. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday it had deployed another of its new Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missiles, which travel faster than the speed of sound and can change direction mid-flight, making them hard to intercept. The ministry in Moscow said a Kinzhal missile fired had hit a fuel depot near the southern city of Mykolaiv. On Saturday it said it had used the missile for the first time to destroy an ammunition depot in western Ukraine. It added that cruise missiles had also been launched from Russian warships in the Caspian Sea to strike the fuel depot and an armour repair plant in the northern Chernihiv region of Ukraine. The claims could not be independently verified. Russian shelling also heavily damaged the Azovstal metallurgical plant in Mariupol, one of the largest in Europe, Ukrainian officials said. “The economic losses for Ukraine are immense,” tweeted an MP, Lesia Vasylenko. The mayor of the encircled northern city of Chernihiv said on Sunday a hospital had been hit in the latest shelling, killing dozens of civilians. “The city is suffering from an absolute humanitarian catastrophe,” Vladislav Atroshenko said. Details are also emerging of a rocket attack that killed as many as 40 marines in the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv on Friday, according to the New York Times, which cited an unnamed Ukrainian military official. Russian forces fired on eight cities and villages in the eastern Donetsk region between Friday and Saturday, Ukraine’s national police said, killing or wounding dozens of civilians. At least 37 residential buildings and facilities were damaged including a school, a museum and a shopping centre. Nevertheless, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Sunday that the frontlines between Ukrainian and Russian forces were “practically frozen” as Russia did not have enough combat strength to advance further. “[Over the past day] there were practically no rocket strikes on [Ukrainian] cities,” Arestovych added. Humanitarian conditions in Ukraine, meanwhile, continued to deteriorate. Aid agencies have warned they are struggling to reach hundreds of thousands of people trapped by Russian forces, whose advance has been slowed by logistics problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance around several key cities. Mariupol is among the hardest hit after suffering heavy bombardment since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February, leaving many of its residents without heat, power or water. Local authorities have said at least 2,300 residents have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves. “To do such a thing to a peaceful city, what the occupiers have done, this is a terror that will be remembered even in the next century,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address early on Sunday. Rescue workers on Sunday were still searching for survivors in the Mariupol Drama Theatre flattened by Russian airstrikes on Wednesday. In the capital, Kyiv, authorities said at least 20 babies carried by Ukrainian surrogate mothers are being cared for by nurses in a bomb shelter because of constant shelling, with parents unable to travel into the war zone to pick them up. Britain’s defence ministry said Ukrainain resistance had forced Russia to “change its operational approach”, but warned that Moscow’s strategy of attrition was “likely to involve the indiscriminate use of firepower resulting in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis”.",News/World news,"Russia bombed Mariupol art school sheltering 400 people, says Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/russia-bombed-mariupol-art-school-sheltering-400-people-says-ukraine
3/20/2022,"A large fire that ravaged important reedbeds looked after by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is no longer burning but concern remains about its consequences for wildlife. Fire crews and six engines from Cheshire and Merseyside fire and rescue services tackled the blaze on marshland near Parkgate on the Wirral peninsula, after being called out at about 6.20pm on Saturday evening. A fire investigator was at the scene and police were told that the fire was suspected to have been started deliberately. The RSPB said the full extent of the damage to the reserve – home to birds including bearded tits, Cetti’s warblers and bittern – was still being assessed. Marsh harriers were also beginning to build their nests on land now lost to fire. The blaze, driven by wind, extended to more than 1 sq km of marshland on a site of special scientific interest. Carl Nevitt, a station manager for Cheshire fire and rescue services, was in charge of the response to the incident. He said: “We created fire breaks to protect properties and the police air support unit was used to give us information on the directional spread of the blaze. “We were at the scene for some 15 hours, leaving just before 10am this morning having monitored the area overnight after the flames were extinguished.” Unstable ground meant fire crews had to leave the fire to burn itself out. Drone footage taken on Sunday morning revealed a large swathe of marshland had burned, leading to concern about the consequences for wildlife and habitats. The RSPB said it was “shocked and saddened” by the fire which it said had “devastated” the Neston reedbed, part of its Burton Mere Wetlands reserve. The charity said the full extent of the damage was being assessed and it would share further details once more information emerges. A spokesperson added: “We’d like to take this opportunity to thank the emergency services for all they’ve done so far in helping to tackle and investigate the fire.” Cheshire constabulary appealed to the public for information and said they were particularly keen to talk to a group of teenagers seen in the area at 6.20pm. The three boys and a girl are described as being aged between 14 and 15. The girl had long dark hair and was wearing a dark jacket. The two boys were wearing dark jackets and the third teenager was wearing a light blue jacket and trousers. The fire could be seen for miles around, and dramatic images and video were shared on social media. One Twitter user described the fire as a “dreadful sight”.

3/20/2022,"Exactly two years ago Prof Sir Andrew Pollard was starting to panic. “We were just waking up to the reality of Covid-19 and that we would need vaccines for our very survival,” the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group told the Guardian this week. He joined forces with a colleague, Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert, and together they launched one of the greatest medical missions in modern history. Their seemingly impossible task – to design, develop and deliver a vaccine from scratch to slow the advance of a lethal pandemic – was completed in less than 12 months, to the relief of millions. Today though, the coronavirus landscape – and the status of their jab, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 – looks very different. In the UK, half the population have had their vaccine, restrictions have ended, and while cases and hospitalisations are rising in the UK, a dramatic uptick in deaths is not expected. The jab has saved more than a million lives, according to estimates, but its reputation has been battered by a toxic mix of misinformation, miscommunication and mishaps. Two years after Pollard, Gilbert and their teams first began making the miracle jab now known as Vaxzevria or Covishield, it has been sidelined in the UK and Europe, and snubbed in the US. Instead, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is gearing up for what will probably be its final act: saving the rest of the world. About 2.6bn doses of it have been distributed to 183 countries, but 3 billion people have yet to receive a first dose of any Covid jab. The highly infectious Omicron variant is flagging in the west, but new cases are soaring in less-vaccinated areas. Globally, daily cases remain high, averaging about 1.8m – three times the 600,000 a day in December. Cases are rising in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, and the low cost and ease with which the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could be deployed to these regions, as well as the more “inaccessible parts of the world”, meant the jab could still play a crucial role in helping end the pandemic, Pollard said. “Protecting people elsewhere is also important for our own defence,” he added. The current vaccine gap could open the door to a deadly new variant, which is why he believes the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab’s ultimate legacy will be to build a “global wall of immunity” in 2022 – saving more lives in low- and middle-income parts of the world but also slashing the risk of new variants arriving in the UK and elsewhere. While Pollard takes “huge satisfaction” from “a team of boffins” developing a jab that has been so widely used, he admitted the last two years had not been straightforward, adding: “Misinformation has undermined confidence in the vaccine.” Particularly damaging, he said, was a story from Germany in January 2021 incorrectly claiming the jab had only 8% efficacy in elderly people. Looking back at the behaviour of politicians who pushed the “nonsense” claims, Pollard was scathing. “President Macron amplified the story globally by claiming the vaccine was ‘quasi-ineffective’,” he said. “It is difficult to fathom why he would make such a comment in the midst of the Alpha wave with thousands dying across the continent, but the damage was done.” Hours later the European Medicines Agency approved its use for all ages, but many countries still opted not to use the vaccine for their elderly people. “The rhetoric undermined confidence in the vaccine, undoubtedly costing lives,” said Pollard. Delayed deliveries and lower efficacy rates than mRNA jabs have also not helped the Oxford/AstraZeneca cause. But other scientists have a different take on the jab’s bumpy ride – suggesting those involved with its development are also to blame. The lack of older people in its trials compared with the mRNA studies, for example, was a “big issue”, Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, told the Guardian. “Given that these age groups were always going to be the number one priority, not including them was a mistake.” Dr Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at Leicester University who previously worked on respiratory virus outbreaks in Hong Kong and Singapore, is also critical of the “overly complex” early Oxford/AstraZeneca trials. Reflecting on them this week, what still strikes him now was their “uneven make-up” with “no elderly initially, and few BAME participants”. Hunter and Tang also raise the dosing debacle. A blunder meant some doses given to volunteers were only half-strength. The initial half-dose jab received by about 3,000 British patients proved far more effective than the full dose that up to 20,000 Brazilians received. The efficacy rate in Britain was 90%, compared with 62% in Brazil. The overall rate of 70% sowed huge confusion, especially when compared with the much clearer results of trials by Pfizer and Moderna. The final straw for some came in March 2021. A link between the jab and rare blood clots emerged, which partly explains why the UK now favours other jabs as boosters. In December, Menelas Pangalos, the executive vice-president for research and development at AstraZeneca, said the company hoped to tweak its recipe to avoid the issue. However, the Guardian has learned the company has since abandoned that idea – because it has still not identified the cause. “This being the case we are not at this time looking to modify the vaccine,” a spokesperson confirmed this week. Two years after the jab’s inception, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, insists he has no regrets. “It is really hard to regret anything when you have delivered 2.6bn doses of vaccine, saved 1 million lives around the world and enabled economies in many countries to restart,” he said. “A lot of people focus on some of the challenges that we faced in parts of the world, but I would like to remind everybody again that the US and Europe represent about 10% of the world’s population.” Indeed, a data analysis for the Guardian by Airfinity, the health analytics company, reveals that despite the jab’s trials and tribulations, it is already reaching every corner of the globe. Among the 2.6bn doses delivered, 166m have gone to Brazil, 84m to Mexico, 60m to Vietnam, 54m to the Philippines, 19m to Nigeria, and 16m to Iran, for example. Even Germany and France, once the sources of slipshod reporting and false claims about the jab, have quietly accepted 31m and 10m doses respectively, the analysis reveals. Despite the early “excessive hype”, Tang says it remains an “effective” and “useful” vaccine that can still play a big role. “The AZ vaccine is cheap, easy to store and its overall efficacy is still generally sufficient to roll out across many countries to offer protection against severe Covid-19.” Designed to be sold not-for-profit – for about £3 a dose, a fifth of the price of Pfizer’s jab – it recently started turning a modest profit. Rivals have made tens of billions of dollars but Pollard calls AstraZeneca “morally brave” for ignoring the “perverse commercial incentive in a pandemic to sell first to the rich”. A spokesperson says low-income nations will continue to receive the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis. AstraZeneca is under contract to deliver a further 1.4bn doses worldwide this year, according to a second Airfinity data analysis for the Guardian. “We estimate these [orders] will be fulfilled by the autumn,” said Matt Linley, Airfinity’s analytics director. Some of AstraZeneca’s 25 facilities in 15 countries will reduce their output after that, he expects. “However, we do not foresee demand for the AstraZeneca jab ending completely,” Linley added. “There will remain a need for it, although at a much lower level, especially in difficult to reach parts of the world.”",News/Society,Oxford Covid jab gears up for final act: saving the rest of the world,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/20/oxford-covid-jab-vaccine-astrazeneca
3/20/2022,"Why do many animals snore? Making such loud noises when sleeping surely is an advertisement to any nocturnal predator that unconscious prey is close by and relatively vulnerable. Geoff Moore Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. If my wife is anything to go by then it’s to mimic the sound of a giant dinosaur sleeping really close by, thereby scaring the hell out of any predators. Tintenfische If snoring and farting did, in fact, significantly imperil the animals in question, then natural selection would have eliminated those respiratory and digestive features. The fact that snoring and farting are prevalent in many species, informs you that they do not significantly imperil the creatures. JPL_Sussex I guess it sends an audible signal to other animals: “I am sleeping now, if danger comes, wake me up.” RECEIVE3 The animals we notice snoring are often pets or domestic animals, whose breeding is not really geared to evading predators. From the evidence of wildlife documentaries and zoos, other snorers are the likes of bears and lions, who are the predators others have to keep clear of, or maybe some who sleep deep and secure in burrows. Snoring is parts of the upper airways, such as tongue and throat, vibrating when they are relaxed in sleep. Being overweight or sleeping in certain positions can make it louder, traits that are only likely to occur for those who are in little immediate danger of being pounced on by predators. Advertising where and how they sleep is a luxury reserved for those animals who don’t need to worry. leadballoon Our garden in north Nottinghamshire seems to have hibernating hedghogs every year. Towards the end of winter they typically snore really loudly, which I would have thought was a problem for a hibernating snack. Bufospinosus I think it was originally a problem until urban foxes worked out that, while it might look like a hibernating snack, it’s actually much like an angry ball of nails. Our cats (none of whom were prodigiously endowed when it came to mental acuity) quickly worked out that hedgehogs were more difficult to open than a can of cat food, and the reward for doing so was not worth the trip to the vet that ensued. HrDrIgelMeister Its probably just an emergent property of sleeping when the animal’s waking super-control of everything is switched off. You continue breathing deeper and deeper while asleep and the airflow in the passageways creates a snort. This might actually be a warning to any predator that the snorer is actually not as asleep as they seem. Most animals in the wild will sleep with one eye open … kglowe Do they snore in the wild, though? Or is it a side-effect of a far more comfortable life that are having in captivity or in people’s homes. Bear in mind that many animals in captivity (or domesticated) reach an age and a size that they would never achieve in nature and snoring has a lot to do with both. YRV2016 I doubt it is possible to snore underwater, so snoring must have evolved after our exit from the sea. Think walruses basking in the sun making the fish and oysters jealous of their extravagant respiratory raspberry blowing and you’ll get the picture. Snoring is therefore a sign of high status designed to create envy among those who cannot sleep. Holy_Ska_Dubman I think we make far too much of the idea that the world is predatory. Look at some of the YouTube vids that show different species helping each out for no reason or gain, but because they can. There’s plenty of room for us all, or there used to be. Snoring is most likely the audible expression of a universal link to spirituality. HolgerDan A friend of mine works for the Highways Agency, which does an incredible (and invisible and unappreciated) job of looking after roadside habitats to try to maintain as much wildlife as possible. Until I met him, for example, I never knew that it looked after the big bat colony under the M5 between Bristol and Clevedon and it has very strict rules around heights of cutting back habitats to help roosting birds etc. His finest hour was helping his eight-year-old daughter with her class assembly project on mice. The video of hibernating mice snoring themselves silly brought the house down. Jaws4PM Snoring is caused by the unavoidable, age-related relaxing of the soft palate (assisted by fat accumulation, which further softens the tissue and muscle relaxant drugs like alcohol). Evolution ignores anything that happens after the much earlier progeny-bearing age, since by that point genes have already been selected and passed on. So you could just as well ask what possible survival benefit is there to arthritis, or losing our hearing? In fact, most animals outside of human domestication probably just don’t live long enough to even reach an age where their body gets a chance to soften enough for snoring to start (or arthritis, deafness or any other signs of ageing) being picked off by disease and ordinary, non-snore-assisted predation. Nor is their diet usually rich enough in calories to gain the aforementioned weight. Some do discover the joys of fermented fruit though, and also presumably related binge-drinking related snoring and – assuming they survive the night – hangovers. HaveYouFedTheFish Evolution certainly can have effects on a species’ post-breeding individuals; hence the menopause in humans. Genes don’t simply exist in the context of one individual, a group shares largely the same genes, so things that can can advantage the group – such as childcare-sharing older women no longer suffering the extreme risks of birth – can evolve. Imtryingdamnit Nocturnal hunters tend to hunt by smell. snazpizaz2 Animals snore because unlike me they don’t use a CPAP.

3/20/2022,"A young woman who was killed in a student flat in London over the weekend has been named by police as 19-year-old Sabita Thanwani. Police were called to an accommodation block in Clerkenwell for students at City, University of London at 5.10am on Saturday after emergency services received reports of an injured woman. Officers and the London ambulance service attended and found Thanwani suffering from serious injuries. They attempted to revive her, but she was pronounced dead at the scene at Arbour House, Sebastian Street. Thanwani’s family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers. A special post-mortem examination will be arranged in due course, police said. Detectives said they are looking for Maher Maaroufe, 22, a Tunisian national who is known to travel and has links across London. The Metropolitan police said anyone who sees Maaroufe should not approach him and call 999 immediately. No arrests have been made and detectives from the Met’s specialist crime command are leading the investigation. DCI Linda Bradley from the unit said: “I am reiterating our urgent appeal for information to trace 22-year-old Maher Maaroufe. He has links across London, particularly in the Marble Arch, Edgware Road and Lewisham areas. He is also known to travel to Cambridgeshire.” One of the images police released shows Maaroufe with dark hair and a moustache and beard. They said he has now shaved his head and has little facial hair. “Maaroufe had been in a relationship with Sabita but he was not a student,” Bradley said. “He is a Tunisian national of no fixed address. “Officers are making inquiries to trace those who had contact with him, but I would ask anyone who knew him who has yet to speak with police to please get in touch. “I am also appealing, once again, for Maher Maaroufe to attend a police station immediately. Maher – I am making this appeal directly to you: if you see this, please go to the nearest police station. It is important that we speak with you.” The front of Arbour House, a multi-storey block, was taped off and a section of nearby Goswell Road was closed to traffic on Saturday. Ana, 20, an international student and resident at Arbour House, was in the building when the police arrived. “It has made me feel really uncomfortable and reminded me that we have to take extra precautions, especially as she was a woman around my age,” she said. “Seeing the police was scary at the beginning. We heard all the banging, the police raiding rooms to investigate on the fifth floor. I don’t actually know where they found her, but they were coming into our rooms. “But now it feels a lot safer to have them around while they investigate.” A spokesperson for Unite Students, which runs Arbour House, said: “As this remains an ongoing police incident, we are unable to comment on their investigation. “Our priority at this time is the safety and wellbeing of students at Arbour House. We are working closely with the police and City, University of London.” A spokesperson for City, University of London said: “As a university, we will do everything we can to support our students and staff and we will continue to fully support the police with their investigation.

3/20/2022,"Startling heatwaves at both of Earth’s poles are causing alarm among climate scientists, who have warned the “unprecedented” events could signal faster and abrupt climate breakdown. Temperatures in Antarctica reached record levels at the weekend, an astonishing 40C above normal in places. At the same time, weather stations near the north pole also showed signs of melting, with some temperatures 30C above normal, hitting levels normally attained far later in the year. At this time of year, the Antarctic should be rapidly cooling after its summer, and the Arctic only slowly emerging from its winter, as days lengthen. For both poles to show such heating at once is unprecedented. The rapid rise in temperatures at the poles is a warning of disruption in Earth’s climate systems. Last year, in the first chapter of a comprehensive review of climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of unprecedented warming signals already occurring, resulting in some changes – such as polar melt – that could rapidly become “irreversible”. The danger is twofold: heatwaves at the poles are a strong signal of the damage humanity is wreaking on the climate; and the melting could also trigger further cascading changes that will accelerate climate breakdown. As polar sea ice melts, particularly in the Arctic, it reveals dark sea that absorbs more heat than reflective ice, warming the planet further. Much of the Antarctic ice covers land, and its melting raises sea levels. Scientists warned that the events unfolding were “historic”, “unprecedented” and “dramatic”. The Associated Press reported that one weather station in Antarctica beat its all time record by 15C, while another coastal station used to deep freezes at this time of year was 7C above freezing.",News/Environment,Heatwaves at both of Earth’s poles alarm climate scientists,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/20/heatwaves-at-both-of-earth-poles-alarm-climate-scientists
3/20/2022,"Rishi Sunak has repeatedly declined to say how many more people could be pushed into fuel poverty by rising energy prices, saying only that people should not be scared. The chancellor is facing increasing pressure over cost of living issues in the run-up to Wednesday’s spring budgetary statement, with particular concerns that a rise in energy bills next month, followed by another in October, will be devastating for household budgets. “Without question, this is people’s number one priority at the moment,” Sunak told BBC One’s Sunday Morning programme when asked about energy costs. “I get that, and I know how difficult it is when you’re working hard and seeing the price of everything go up every week. “And the steps that we have taken to sanction Russia are not cost-free for us at home. I want to be honest with people: it’s not going to be easy.” However, when asked a number of times how many people could potentially fall into fuel poverty, Sunak declined to answer the question, saying only that actions already taken – including a £150 council tax rebate for homes in bands A to D, and a £200 discount on bills in October that will be repaid with higher bills in future years – “will make a big difference”. Appearing earlier on the same show, the consumer expert Martin Lewis predicted that 10 million people could experience fuel poverty, saying the impact of energy prices would have a worse impact than Covid or the financial crisis of 2008. “Money prioritisation used to be, do I go to the hairdresser or do I go to the pub and have a takeaway. Now it’s about: I’m prioritising feeding my children over feeding myself,” Lewis said. “That is simply not tenable in our society. There is absolute panic, and it has not started yet.” “It’s not something money management can fix,” he said. “We need political intervention.” When asked about Lewis’s forecast of the number who could face fuel poverty, Sunak said: “I don’t know if he presented any analysis to show that.” Asked if he had done such an analysis, he said: “The analysis we’ve done will show that the impact of policies we’ve put in place will disproportionately help those on lower incomes.” While declining to speculate on what, if any, extra help might come this week, Sunak said people should “judge me by my actions over the past two years”, adding: “Where we have been able to make a difference, I have tried to do that.” Questioned about another likely rise in energy bills in October, when the price cap for the bills is next reassessed, Sunak said: “We don’t know and I don’t want people to be scared. What we have is a price cap that will protect people all the way through to the autumn. We’ve acted now to help them with the increase that is coming in, in April. The situation is obviously very volatile in Ukraine.” In an earlier interview with Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Sunak hinted he could be leaning towards measures to help people with petrol and diesel costs. “Obviously I can’t comment on specific things,” he said. “But what I would say is, I understand that. I have a rural constituency; people are incredibly reliant on their cars, and this is one of the biggest bills that people face, watching it go up. “We are all seeing that when we are filling up our cars. I get that. That’s why we have frozen fuel duty already; I announced that in autumn. It’s the 11th consecutive year of fuel duty freezes and that really helps people, I know that.”",News/Business,Rishi Sunak declines to say how many more people could face fuel poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/rishi-sunak-fuel-poverty-energy-price-rises-martin-lewis
