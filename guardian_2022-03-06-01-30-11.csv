3/6/2022,"Ukraine claimed to have destroyed more Russian forces on Saturday, as the Kremlin continued to bomb civilian targets on the tenth day of its invasion, and a plan to evacuate residents from the besieged city of Mariupol fell apart because of hostilities. The defence ministry in Kyiv said its soldiers had shot down an enemy helicopter and a warplane, capturing its pilot. They also launched a successful counter-attack in the Kharkiv region, seizing equipment. The city, Ukraine’s second biggest, has been under ferocious Russian bombardment. Russia’s military machine controls much of south-eastern and southern Ukraine, including the city of Kherson and its surrounding province. Residents flooded into its main square on Saturday and protested peacefully and noisily against occupation. They waved Ukrainian flags and even hijacked a Russian armoured personnel carrier, taking it for a spin, to loud applause. Similar large-scale anti-Russian demonstrations took place in Melitopol, where Russian soldiers fired into the air, and the Azov Sea port of Berdyansk. It is too early to say whether Vladimir Putin’s ambitious plan to conquer Ukraine and topple its pro-western government is grinding towards failure. But there is no doubt Ukraine’s continued ability to fight back has defied his apparent assumption of a swift and largely unopposed Russian military victory. Speaking to the BBC, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, reinforced the message that Moscow’s campaign was faltering and said Ukraine “can absolutely win against Russia”. He observed: “The war has already not gone as Russian president Vladimir Putin might have planned.” US officials point to the fact that Ukrainian aircraft are still operational this weekend, together with some air defence units. It is a scenario most had believed unlikely when Moscow’s so-called “special operation” began last week. Russia has forbidden the word “war” and made its use a criminal offence. “The Ukrainians still have a significant majority of their air combat power available to them, both fixed-wing and rotary wing, as well as unmanned systems and surface-to-air systems,” a US official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. With its land invasion apparently stalled, and with little progress made in the advance of a Russian super-column towards Kyiv, Moscow is increasingly turning to indiscriminate shelling and bombing of civilians. The objective, Kyiv believes, is to spread panic and terror. Multiple cities were hit on Saturday. They included Bila Tserkva, south of the capital, and Kharkiv, where residents spent another night in underground shelters and metro stations. There was fierce fighting in Bucha, just north-west of Kyiv, with reports of civilian casualties. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow’s “terror tactics” were designed to force capitulation. In a video address on Friday night, he berated Nato members for failing to enforce a no-fly zone over the country, saying it gave a “green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages”. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin warned that Russia would consider any third-party declaration of a no-fly zone as participation in the war, and even claimed Ukraine’s leadership was calling into question the future of the country’s statehood, saying that “if this happens, it will be entirely on their conscience”. A desperate humanitarian disaster has been unfolding in Mariupol, where an apparent agreement to evacuate 200,000 people from the port city fell apart because of what Kyiv said was continuous Russian shelling. About 500 people managed to escape from the nearby town of Volnovakha. At least 200,000 people remained trapped in Mariupol on Saturday without heat, electricity and water. “Everything has been hit. Apartment blocks, shops, the hospital. It’s like world war two,” Anatoliy Lozar, a volunteer defender, told the Observer. He added: “We won’t give up. We will fight to the very last man.” Lozar said civilians were paying a terrible price for Russian aggression. “I saw a car pull up outside a hospital and a mother run out with a wounded child. I have no idea whether the child lived or died. We can’t even collect our dead. The morgue has no electricity.” Médicins Sans Frontières said medicines had run out, with locals drinking snow and rainwater. The city’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said supplies of food were critically low. “They want to wipe Mariupol and Mariupol residents off the face of the earth,” he said, describing indiscriminate shelling of residential areas and hospitals. In other parts of the country the Russian military suffered setbacks. Ukrainian self-defence units shared video of what they said was a Russian pilot who had ejected from a plane in the Chernihiv region, north of Kyiv. On Thursday Russian bombs levelled an apartment block in the city, killing 47. The pilot has previously bombed civilians in Syria, local commanders said, saying they would send him to The Hague for trial. His co-pilot died. Another video shows the downing of a Russian military helicopter, which crashed in a fireball seconds after a missile strike. “Russia has a clumsy 20th-century army. Ukraine is using 21st-century weapons like Stingers and Javelins,” Olena Chebeluik, a historian in Lviv, said. She added: “We are fighting in small mobile groups. Our fighters can hide. They know the territory. Locals support them.” The Ukrainian offensive in the Kharkiv region was possible because of “low morale” among occupying forces and a lack of preparation by Russian reserves, Ukraine’s armed forces said. Some separatist units had also pulled back to the Donetsk and Luhansk region after Ukrainian units stormed and seized the rebel-held town of Horlivka. Ukraine’s military claims that 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Moscow puts the figure at 500. On Saturday the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said 66,224 Ukrainians living abroad had returned home to fight – the equivalent of 12 brigades. ‘“Ukrainians, we are invincible!” he said. Outside Lviv’s main recruitment office, instructor Vitaly Glyuk said Ukraine had taken the initiative against a more powerful opponent. “The Russians are getting a bit exhausted. We are now going forward. It’s our time,” he said. He added: “We have been fighting this monster for 300 years already.”",News/World news,Ukraine claims battlefield successes as Mariupol evacuation falls apart,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/ukraine-claims-battlefield-successes-as-mariupol-evacuation-falls-apart-russia
3/6/2022,"More than £85m has been raised to provide aid in Ukraine, in an “absolutely incredible” show of support from the UK public. But the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has urged people to donate money rather than goods to help those affected by the conflict. The DEC, made up of 15 leading UK charities, thanked everyone who has contributed so far and said the message from aid workers at Ukraine’s borders and inside the invaded nation is that money is needed rather than donated items. Giving an update on the progress of its emergency appeal on Saturday, the DEC said: “We are seeing an absolutely incredible response from the public to this appeal, which has now raised over £85m. We are grateful to everyone who is giving, organising events and helping to spread the word. “Our member charities are at the borders and inside Ukraine responding to the huge and growing humanitarian crisis. They are telling us that what they need is funding rather than donated items.” The committee said “generous donations” had been made to the appeal by the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge among others, and the latest total includes £25m from the UK government. The chief executive of the DEC, Saleh Saeed, urged people to donate money because “trying to transport goods from here, the UK, thousands of miles to Ukraine will take a long time and may not be necessarily what people need when it arrives”. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Saturday morning, Saeed said: “What we would advise is the things that people collect today here in the UK are not necessarily what people need tomorrow.” He added that he would urge people to “donate cash through a reputable charity”. The DEC has warned that support for Ukraine is likely to be needed for “months and years” and urged people to keep donating. The appeal has gained considerable traction and been highlighted by various celebrities, including Trigger Point actor Adrian Lester, Game Of Thrones’ Kit Harington and the former Doctor Who David Tennant.",News/Society,Ukraine fundraiser hits £85m as charities say money needed more than goods,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/05/ukraine-fundraiser-hits-85m-as-charities-say-money-needed-more-than-goods
3/6/2022,"Elvira Nabiullina could barely hide her unease. The governor of the central bank of Russia – famed for sending coded messages with her attire – had chosen to dress in funereal black as she warned about the devastating hit to the Russian economy from sweeping sanctions imposed by western governments in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. With the rouble plunging by more than a quarter and queues forming for foreign currency, Nabiullina announced last Monday that the central bank’s key interest rate would more than double to a record 20%, to curb soaring inflation. In steps to cushion the blow for ordinary Russians, capital controls would be put in place, while the stock market would temporarily close. Her choice of clothing, as well as an awkward appearance on TV with Vladimir Putin at an emergency meeting on Monday, have raised questions over what she really thinks about his decision to wage war. Ashen-faced and remote, did she really support the war? “We know she hates the war as she was wearing black on Monday. She always wears something to give her views away,” said Charlie Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital. “She’s in mourning for the Russia she helped to build. I don’t think her feelings will be hidden, and Putin will be aware of it. But he doesn’t care.” Highly respected in the international community, including among some of Putin’s harshest critics, Nabiullina is viewed as a moderniser who reformed the central bank and kept Russia’s economy out of worse trouble despite challenging conditions since taking her post in 2013. As a former trusted adviser to the president, she is credited with helping to build up a “fortress Russia” economy, one with less dependency on the US dollar and better equipped to cope with western sanctions than during Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Softly spoken, she communicates not just through words but through her apparel – especially brooches – to drop hints about her policy thinking. In May 2020, as the government urged people to stay at home, she wore a house-shaped brooch. A month later, after cutting rates, she choose a pigeon – in Russian, the word also means “dove”. “I put something into each symbol but I’m not going to explain,” she told Russian TV two years ago. For Sergei Guriev, a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris and leading authority on Russia, this week’s coded message was to demonstrate the severity of the blow being dealt by western sanctions. “This time she was in black and had no brooch. It should not be read as she disagreed with Putin’s policy, but as a sign that it is time to bury normal monetary policy,” he said. Guriev, a liberal-minded former Kremlin adviser who left Russia abruptly in 2013 amid a political crackdown by Putin, has known Nabiullina for 15 years. “[She is] very highly regarded and respected. Viewed as competent, modest, and honest. “She is trusted by Putin. She has built a lot of elements of fortress Russia – not just foreign exchange reserves but also a domestic payment system and the payment card ‘Mir’ – but I am sure she was not part of the narrow circle making the decision on going to war.” Analysts expect Russia’s economy could be set for a deeper recession this year than the one caused by Covid-19. Sanctions freezing the central bank’s assets have severely limited Nabiullina’s room for manoeuvre. Out of $630bn (£475bn) in foreign currency reserves built up by the central bank – which could have been used to protect the rouble – experts say much of the sum has been rendered useless. Analysts estimate $300bn worth of assets could be tied up at foreign banks, while much of the remaining sum is thought to be in Chinese yuan and gold bullion stored in Moscow, which cannot be sold quickly or easily. With the central bank sanctioned, any possible Middle East or Chinese buyers could also face reprisals from the US. For Nabiullina, the developments unpick almost a decade of work going against the grain of Putin’s increasing global isolation by opening up the economy. When western sanctions came in 2014 following his invasion of Crimea, she opposed capital controls and pressed ahead with floating the rouble on the currency markets, while adopting inflation targeting, in line with the world’s leading central banks. In recent years she has taken public positions to urge the government to accelerate reforms to encourage private investment. “She is a brilliant governor. The war is not her fault,” said one Russian economist based in London. “Putin makes geostrategical decisions with huge economic consequences and leaves it to his team of experienced technocrats to pick up the pieces and sort out the mess.” An ethnic Tatar – the largest minority group in Russia – she was born in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan, between the Volga river and Ural mountains, a year after the Cuban missile crisis. Her mother was a manager at a factory, while her father was a chauffeur. A fan of opera who recites French poetry from memory, she was the first woman to lead the central bank of a G8 country, before Russia’s suspension from the group of rich nations in 2014. Last week, in an internal video, Nabiullina told staff the economy was facing an extreme situation they had all hoped would not happen. “You can just sense that something really serious has just happened. She pleads with her staff not to start arguing about politics. That’s pretty unusual,” said John Lough, an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, who was sent a copy of the video. “There are signs of panic. It’s extraordinarily serious and it’s going to bring the Russian economy to its knees.” Now Russian economists question whether she will stay when her five-year term expires in June, although they say her priority could be to help protect ordinary Russians from the consequence of Putin’s actions by staying in post.",News/Business,Russia’s central bank head ‘is mourning for her economy’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/05/russias-central-bank-head-is-mourning-for-her-economy
3/6/2022,"In the days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of his country, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, used his Telegram channel to send a defiant video message from the centre of the capital, Kyiv, calling on the nation to unite and resist the Russian attack. The WhatsApp-like messaging service, co-founded by exiled Russian billionaire brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, has become a key weapon in a digital propaganda battle that will ultimately boost its usage and investor profile ahead of a possible $50bn stock market flotation next year. Ukraine’s 44-year-old president, a former TV actor and comedian who campaigned over Telegram in the run-up to his landslide victory in the 2019 presidential election, used the service to refute claims that the army had been told to lay down arms, that an evacuation had been ordered – and to galvanise the populace by proving he would not be leaving the capital. Telegram, which has more than 550 million monthly users globally, is already Ukraine’s most popular messaging app. The service’s much-hyped encryption and its ability to disseminate messages to groups of up to 200,000 – the limit on Facebook-owned WhatsApp is 256 members – has seen it dubbed the “app of choice” for terrorists. Telegram was banned in Russia in 2018 after Pavel Durov refused to give the authorities access to its user data. However, the crackdown, which included blocking IP addresses, was easy to circumvent, and the service continued to grow. Russia gave in and lifted the ban in mid-2020. The app has been adopted as a leading source of news outside state-controlled media, and in the Ukrainian war it has become a 24-hour news lifeline for civilians, journalists and even the military. It has become the go-to platform for protest groups of all kinds, from Extinction Rebellion to anti-vaccination groups, from the US Capitol rioters to pro-democracy campaigns in states including Russian-allied Belarus, Hong Kong and Iran. But Telegram’s role in the dissemination of unverified information alarmed the 37-year-old Durov – who has been called the Russian Mark Zuckerberg, after he founded what is still by far the country’s most popular social network, VKontakte (VK), in 2006. Last weekend, he said he was considering shuttering the service in the “countries involved” for the duration of the conflict. “We do not want Telegram to be used as a tool that exacerbates conflicts and incites ethnic hatred,” Durov posted on Sunday. Hours later, he changed his mind, following mass requests from users, who said it was their only source of information. “Double-check and do not take on faith the data that is published in Telegram channels during this difficult period,” Durov advised. Jamie MacEwan, media analyst at research service Enders, said. “This is another example of Telegram being linked to resistance movements. It has very much been part of its reputation over the past couple of years as it has boomed. It is associated with being a safe haven.” Durov is known for occasional eccentric behaviour – he once threw paper aeroplanes made from bank notes out of VKontakte’s office windows, causing fights in the street below, and he publicly offered Edward Snowden a job. He is now on a mission to make his second tech venture the success story that was ultimately wrested from him first time around. During anti-Putin protests in 2012, Durov became hugely popular for refusing to close down groups that were using the social media site to organise marches. Two years later, he was on the receiving end of a hostile investor coup that saw VK appropriated by Mail.Ru group, headed by Russian billionaire and Putin ally Alisher Usmanov. In December, the Kremlin strengthened its grip on the company when Russian insurance company Sogaz, founded by giant Gazprom, took control of VK. Durov sold up and left the business as well as the country, becoming a citizen of St Kitts & Nevis in the Caribbean, after resisting Kremlin pressure to release the data of Ukrainian protest leaders. It is little surprise that Telegram, which he launched with brother Nikolai in 2013 and is operationally headquartered in Dubai, is built on security and privacy. The publicity-averse Durov, who has a penchant for dressing all in black nevertheless spends much of his energy criticising the security standards of rivals, most notably world leader WhatsApp. In recent years security experts have in turn questioned Telegram’s claims of superiority, pointing out that, unlike rivals, it does not offer end-to-end encryption by default over all its messaging options. Moxie Marlinspike, creator of the popular Signal secure messaging app, took to Twitter last week to remind Ukrainians that Telegram is not as encrypted as people think, after what he alleged was a “decade of misleading marketing and press”. Telegram is the most popular messenger in urban Ukraine. After a decade of misleading marketing and press, most ppl there believe it’s an “encrypted app”The reality is the opposite-TG is by default a cloud database w/ a plaintext copy of every msg everyone has ever sent/recvd. https://t.co/6eRGIyXyje Durov’s experience at VK left him with an aversion to bringing in outside investors to fund Telegram. With a fortune estimated at over $17bn, he has been able to support it for most of its early life without outside help. But the search for alternative ways to raise the funds necessary to drive growth led him into an ultimately disastrous foray into the world of cryptoassets. In 2018, Durov embarked on a plan to raise billions through the launch of a cryptocurrency called Grams, a venture that sparked an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US. Pre-sales ahead of the planned initial coin offering (ICO), which would have funded a proposed Telegram Open Network (TON) system of apps services and a store of digital and physical goods, drew a rapturous response from an initial select group of investors, raising $1.7bn. But two years later, Telegram shut TON down and agreed an $18.5m settlement with the SEC, which had argued that Grams bypassed US financing laws. It ordered that the money be returned to investors. The setback in fundraising has not slowed growth, however: in early 2021, Telegram reported the biggest user boost in its history – 25 million in 72 hours. Durov, who is now also a French citizen, credited the rush of new Telegrammers to an announcement by WhatsApp clarifying its privacy policy relating to data sharing with parent Facebook. Durov added, rather grandiosely: “We may be witnessing the largest digital migration in human history.” The WhatsApp policy did not include sharing the content of messages, but it spooked many users, who defected to other platforms anyway: Telegram and Signal were the biggest beneficiaries. “The increasing downloads of Telegram is [partly] driven by consumers’ growing anxiety over the power of the biggest tech companies, and by privacy concerns,” says Forrester analyst Xiaofeng Wang. A few months after that user boost, Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reported that unnamed sources close to the company claimed a $50bn initial public offering was on the cards by the end of next year. A successful IPO would cement the rise of Telegram, which has begun to make headway on the extremely difficult proposition of making money from the users of messaging services. Durov, who once vowed Telegram would never carry ads, is seeking to monetise the platform through a combination of “privacy-safe” advertising and sponsorship of channels. “The timing of the emergence of talk of an IPO is quite telling, coming almost immediately after the early 2021 boom when its user potential started to explode,” says MacEwan at Enders. “I think the momentum they now have, the sheer weight of users, and the fact they are experimenting with ‘privacy safe’ advertising make them an attractive flotation candidate.” A Telegram spokesman confirmed that the company is pursuing plans for an initial public offering, and that some pre-IPO bonds have been sold with a five-year expiry, but cautioned that the timeline is not certain. “As for the IPO plans, they will depend on the economic situation at the time,” he said.",News/Business,Telegram app rides high on thirst for trustworthy news ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/05/telegram-app-ukraine-rides-high-thirst-trustworthy-news
3/6/2022,"So is the conflict in Ukraine – as some of the world’s media seem to think, the “TikTok war” – or, more generically, “the first social media war”? As Russian tanks rolled into the country, videos of frightened people huddling together, explosions blasting through urban streets and missiles streaking across Ukrainian skies suddenly replaced TikTok’s usual fare of memes, jokes, fitness and dance videos. “Ukrainian social media influencers,” reported Reuters, “uploaded bleak scenes of themselves wrapped in blankets in underground bunkers and army tanks rolling down residential streets, juxtaposed against photos of blooming flowers and laughing friends at restaurants that honoured more peaceful memories of their home towns. They urged their followers to pray for Ukraine, donate to support the Ukrainian military and demanded Russian users in particular to join anti-war efforts.” TikTok users across the country began livestreaming the war and the buildup of Russian forces, denying Vlad the Invader the ability to dominate the narrative about what was happening. All of which is impressive. It was a light (sometimes the only light last week) shining in the darkness. What we were seeing, wrote Chris Stokel-Walker on Vice, was the “meme-ification of the Ukraine invasion”. In a networked world, this is supposedly a big deal because memes can be used to dominate the information space – now believed to be an important element of any conflict. The strange thing is that, up to now, we thought that the Russians were the Olympic champions of this stuff. One thinks of the famous “Gerasimov doctrine” – their new theory of modern warfare that emphasised hacking an enemy’s society rather than attacking it head-on. And yet in the early days of the assault on Ukraine, they’ve been struggling to gain a foothold, partly because of the way western tech platforms have silenced Russian disinformation agencies, but also because pro-Ukrainian voices are drowning them out on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Why has TikTok become so important in this story? One answer, suggests Stokel-Walker, is that – as a medium – it’s ideally suited to war. It “throws users headlong into an immersive, endless stream of snappy content”, he writes, and “is designed to monopolise attention. Even legitimate information can work by appealing to outrage – and there are few things more outrageous than what’s going on in Ukraine at present.” TikTok makes it really easy for users to become creators themselves just by responding to existing videos – and in the process boost the virality of what appears in their feeds. That has its downsides, though – just as the “retweet” button on Twitter has. If you’re just building on something you’ve received from someone else, that means you might be inadvertently recirculating misinformation. One viral hit, for example – a video clip posted on TikTok and labelled “Bro fucking Russian paratrooper filming there [sic] TikTok while dropping in Ukraine” – turned out to have originally been posted on Instagram in 2015. This is not to suggest that TikTok is more riddled with disinformation than other social media, just that the authenticity of what appears on it can be difficult to establish. The upside is that the internet is also good at debunking falsehoods. The Russians have already had some experience of this. On 21 February the country’s Tass news agency reported that five Ukrainian soldiers had crossed the border into Russia in two armoured personnel carriers and that Russian forces destroyed both vehicles and killed the five Ukrainians in them. In no time at all, online sleuths at Bellingcat exposed the video as fake news. Geolocation data showed that it had been filmed not in Russia but inside the occupied part of Ukraine; and the destroyed personnel carriers were a type that Ukraine doesn’t own, painted over to make them look Ukrainian. Seeing the embattled Ukrainians vanquish Putin on social media is deeply satisfying. But there’s a whiff of Arab spring about it – a tendency to confuse online excitement with more sobering realities of power, ideology and ruthlessness. When Stalin was informed that the pope was opposed to something he wanted to do, his icy riposte was: “And how many divisions has the pope?” Something similar applies today. Faced with the rout of his bots on social media and his banishment from tech platforms, Vlad the Invader might similarly inquire how many missiles does TikTok or Facebook possess? And he knows the answer, as do we in our hearts. The battle for Ukraine won’t be fought with memes.

3/6/2022,"There is both stillness and movement in Caroline de Wolf’s Belgian home. Its defining feature is the monumental staircase, based on the central spiral ramp in New York’s Guggenheim Museum, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Inspired by their love of the visionary American architect, De Wolf and her husband, engineer-turned-designer Joris Van Apers, built the house in Duffel, just south of Antwerp, in 2000. It was designed by Van Apers, who was working as an engineer at the time. He now runs the family business, Joris Van Apers BV, which is both a design studio and a supplier of reclaimed wood. De Wolf is the CFO. The couple’s passion for wood, and for nature, is a unifying feature of a space governed by architectural flow. “The different rhythms of the house follow the rhythm of the staircase,” says De Wolf. Rising through all three levels of the house, the spiral construction is made of a mixture of plaster and hard micro-cement. The treads are pine. “All levels and rooms lead to the staircase, like the branches of a tree to their trunk.” “We wanted a house with open spaces that connected with nature and lots of light, but we also wanted warmth and intimacy,” says De Wolf of the 5,400sqft three-bedroom home. A mixture of materials, including a range of reclaimed woods, slate tiles reclaimed from a monastery, and lime-finished walls, provide warm hues as well as texture. In the living room, the dynamic interplay of colours that characterise Paul Klee’s paintings was the starting point. The vivid red of paired shelving is picked up in De Wolf’s favourite artworks, two abstract paintings by Belgian artist Michel Mouffe installed over the slate fireplace. A Murano glass table lamp, golden curtains and panelled ceiling offset lime-washed teal walls and the two inviting 1930s blue lounge chairs – by Czech designer Jindrich Halabala – gather around another standout piece, the coffee table by the Belgian artist and designer Ado Chale. This is a home for moving between spaces and relaxing, but glance up and you see not only the reclaimed pine-beamed ceiling, inspired by New York’s Gramercy Park Hotel, but also the railings of the fitness centre at half-level, used by the couple’s two daughters, 17 and 14. A passerelle, or bridge, designed to add depth and geometry, connects the fitness area to the girls’ bedrooms. There’s also a pool in the garden, heated year-round for daily swimming and, in the main bedroom up in the eaves, a hot tub is concealed beneath a deep, pine window seat. Lift the pine seat, climb in and, “with the windows open, it creates the feeling of being outside in the bath, and a strong connection to nature,” says De Wolf. “When the hot tub is closed you can sit, relax, read or meditate on the window sill.” Versatile and housing concealed storage, these resting quarters (“bedroom” doesn’t do the space justice) are both functional and calming. A television is hidden inside a nutwood trunk at the foot of the bed and there’s a dressing room behind double pine doors. “We were looking for intimacy and a place to relax,” says De Wolf, “a bedroom not just for sleeping, but also for tranquillity and peace.” The hot tub, she says, shows off her husbands’s “playfulness”, as well as his fondness for “secret, surprising places”. In both the main bedroom and bathroom the rich grains of wood and the use of textured fabric counter the almost ascetic feel created by the lime-washed walls, steel windows and steel-framed glass partitioning. There’s something monastic – and chic – about it. In fact, the term “boutique monastic” could be coined just for this house. In the bedroom, the pine floorboards were blackened by a process similar to shou sugi ban, the Japanese technique of burning wood. In the bathroom, York stone tiles on the floor complement an antique Italian nutwood counter salvaged from an old bank, and customised ceramic basins. “We love the tactility, the structure of wood, and the fact that it is a natural material,” says De Wolf. It’s downstairs in the living and dining area that the family spend most of their time. “This is where we relax together as a family,” says De Wolf. “The big oak table, designed and made by Joris, is used as a work table and as a dining table.” The tiles on the kitchen island, also designed by Van Apers – as were so many features of the house – were handmade by a French ceramicist named Regula Brotbek. In characteristic attention to detail, the pattern was inspired by a vase Brotbek designed for Van Apers’s mother. The slate worktop was made in the company’s studio. The kitchen looks out on to the garden on three sides. “We love the contact with nature when we are sitting here,” says De Wolf. “We drink our coffee and read the papers here, and always eat here as a family.” vanapers.be",Lifestyle/Life and style,Upward spiral: inside a chic Antwerp home,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/05/upward-spiral-inside-a-chic-antwerp-home

3/6/2022,"Tadej Pogacar picked himself up off the gravel to win Strade Bianche with a stunning solo ride into Siena. The reigning Tour de France champion was involved in a huge crash early in the race but blew apart the field after it came back together to cross the finish line alone. Pogacar made a bold move with 49km to go on in the early part of the seventh gravel section and quickly established a gap of more than minute and a half on the peloton behind. Alejandro Valverde, who finished second in his final Strade Bianche, and Kasper Asgreen put up a chase behind but were not able to catch Pogacar who rode alone for a quarter of the race. Before the Slovenian’s stunning attack, the defining moment of the race looked to be a huge crash with around 100km to go that took out a number of the leading riders and saw Jumbo-Visma’s 2018 winner Tiesj Benoot, among others, retire. The crash saw pre-race favourite Julian Alaphilippe fly dramatically over his handlebars and the reigning world champion was probably only saved worse injury by managing to unclip from his pedals as a Quick-Step colleague was blown across his path by the strong winds. Alaphilippe and most of what remained of the peloton were able to make up a two-minute disadvantage on those who stayed upright to rejoin the front of the race, but were left in the dust by Pogacar soon after. Earlier, SD Worx played their hand to perfection, enabling Lotte Kopecky to win the women’s race. The powerhouse Dutch team managed to get three riders into the leading pack in the final kilometres, isolating two-time winner Annemiek van Vleuten, and setting up the Belgian national champion to get the racing line through the windy roads of Siena as they came off the top of the brutal final climb. Kopecky, 26, powered away through the final turns to claim what she described as the biggest win of her career. “It was a really good plan from the team,” Kopecky told Eurosport post-race. “Racing like this is super nice to do, I have teammates behind me who have my back. “I was never confident of beating [Van Vleuten]. I knew she was the person to follow. I let her go a bit on the last climb and then just kept going. I turned to the right to pass her, she passed again and then it was sprint through the last corner.”",Sport/Sport,Tadej Pogacar leaves rivals in dust for stunning solo win at Strade Bianche,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/tadej-pogacar-leaves-rivals-in-dust-for-stunning-solo-win-strade-bianche-lotte-kopecky-cycling
3/6/2022,"Boris Johnson has praised British journalists who were hit by bullets in Ukraine and said press reporting on the conflict “will not be intimidated or cowed”. The prime minister commended the “astonishing” courage of the Sky News journalists, who he said were “putting themselves in terrifying and dangerous situations”. Stuart Ramsay, the broadcaster’s chief correspondent, was hit by a bullet in his lower back when a car carrying him and a crew towards Kyiv was shot at on Monday. The camera operator Richie Mockler was hit with two rounds to his body armour. After managing to escape and take cover they were later rescued by Ukrainian police. Afterwards, they were told by Ukrainians that they had been ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad. The entire crew, which also included Dominique van Heerden and Martin Vowles from Sky News and local producer Andrii Lytvynenko, are now safe. Footage of the incident, showing the team under heavy fire while glass smashed around them, was played on Sky News on Friday. “The courage of these journalists, putting themselves in terrifying and dangerous situations, is astonishing to watch. They’re risking their lives to ensure that the truth is told,” Johnson wrote on Twitter. “Free press will not be intimidated or cowed by barbaric and indiscriminate acts of violence.” In a written account of the attack, Ramsay said his team had been on their way to the town of Bucha to report on the destruction of a Russian convoy by the Ukrainian army the previous day. Their journey was just under 20 miles (30km) from the centre of Kyiv but, held up by road closures and redirections, it took hours. At the last Ukrainian checkpoint they were advised not to travel further so they decided to turn around. But after they were given the go-ahead by a police officer, they cautiously drove towards an intersection when “out of nowhere” there was a “small explosion”. Ramsay said that a tyre burst, the car stopped and “our entire world turned upside down”. “The first round cracked the windscreen. Camera operator Richie Mockler huddled into the front passenger footwell. Then we were under full attack,” he said. “Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel, and dashboard had disintegrated. “We didn’t know it at the time, but we were later told by the Ukrainians that we were being ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad. It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car – they didn’t miss.” Thinking that perhaps a Ukrainian army checkpoint might be responsible for the shooting, some of them stepped out of the car to explain that they were journalists. But the bullets continued. “I do recall wondering if my death was going to be painful,” Ramsay said. After being hit by a bullet in the lower back, he was told that he got out of the car and started running but lost his balance and fell. “Landing like a sack of potatoes, cutting my face. My armour and helmet almost certainly saved me,” he said. The team managed to get to a factory unit where they took cover and were later rescued by police. The Sky News crew members have since returned to the UK and Lytvynenko is with his family in Ukraine. “We were very lucky,” Ramsay said. “But thousands of Ukrainians are dying, and families are being targeted by Russian hit squads just as we were, driving along in a family saloon and attacked. This war gets worse by the day.”",News/World news,Boris Johnson praises ‘astonishing’ courage of UK journalists shot by Russian hit squad,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/boris-johnson-praises-astonishing-courage-of-uk-journalists-shot-by-russian-hit-squad
3/6/2022,"After Oksana Masters won the first US gold medal of the 2022 Beijing Paralympics on Saturday by taking first in the women’s biathlon sitting sprint, the Ukraine-born multi-sport star dedicated her win to the people of her homeland. Masters, who finished the 6km course in 20min 51.2sec with a 100% accuracy in two prone shootings, shared the podium with Kendall Gretsch, another American multi-sport threat who earned the bronze four years after taking gold in Pyeongchang. China’s Yilin Shan won silver for the host country. “I owe a lot to my mom and then it is for Team Ukraine and Ukrainian people,” Masters said. “It is as much for Team USA as is for Ukraine. I’m so proud to be Ukrainian, to be American and represent both and that’s the power of sports that you can represent so much more than just one thing.” For the 32-year-old Masters, it marked her 11th career Paralymic medal – and fifth gold – less then eight months her road cycling golds in time trial and road race at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo. Her eighth career Winter Paralympic medal lifted Masters into a tie for third all-time among US women behind only alpine skiiers Sarah Will and Sarah Billmeier, who won 13 apiece. She could race up to seven times over nine days in Beijing, placing that record squarely in target. But for all the silverware in her trophy cabinet, Saturday’s win marked her first biathlon title in three tries. “My first biathlon gold medal and I never thought I will ever, ever achieve this and hence it is so special,” she said. “This was my third time around, I played in Sochi and I played PyeongChang and to finally get it in Beijing was special. To share that podium, I think from day one is great, incredible things are coming for [Team USA]. Masters, who was born with defects believed to be from the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident, spent the first seven years of her life in three different Ukraine orphanages before she was adopted by a Kentucky woman. Afterward, Masters said that she sympathized with her fellow competitors from Russia and Belarus who were forced to withdraw due to the Ukraine conflict. “It is sad and my heart goes out for the Russian and Belarusian athletes,” Masters said. “Honestly, I was at the dinning hall and one of them came and hugged me and was crying because they wanted to compete. “I wish that we are living in a world where every single athletes from every country could represent every part of the world. Come together and brace each other together and participate not against each other but with each other. I wish they were here and I hope for peace really really soon. I can’t wait to race with the Russian athletes and the Belarusian athletes.” Gretsch, who was born with spina bifida, took bronze in Saturday’s event after winning gold in the paratriathlon at the Summer Paralympics in August. The 29-year-old from Downers Grove, Illinois, also won two golds at the 2018 Paralympics – one in 6km biathlon and one in 12km cross-country skiing – only two years after first taking up Nordic skiing after learning that her paratriathlon class wouldn’t be included in the 2016 Rio Games.",Sport/Sport,Ukraine-born Oksana Masters wins first US gold of Beijing  Winter Paralympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/oksana-masters-first-gold-paralympics-ukraine
