2/11/2022,"As the Navy continues to investigate what happened to Kyle Mullen, the former Manalapan High School football star who died Feb. 4 shortly after completing the most arduous phase of the Navy SEAL selection process, a former SEAL candidate who knew Mullen detailed his own traumatic “Hell Week” experience in an interview with the Asbury Park Press. “Hell Week” runs from Sunday through Friday, a five-and-a-half day test for the SEALs’ BUD/S class, which involves underwater demolition, survival and combat tactics. It comes in the fourth week as part of the selection process for the Naval Special Warfare Basic Training Command. A majority of the candidates do not finish the week. Mullen, 24, died hours after completing Hell Week in San Diego. The former SEAL candidate, whose name is being withheld because of the matter’s sensitive nature, attempted Hell Week in 2021.

When they pulled me, they brought me to a classroom with cots in it and kept me there. I was really messed up with bad chafing and my muscles just were not working.” He said the classroom was monitored, but not by medical personnel. “In the classroom I didn’t have any medical attention,” he said. After several hours, he said, the monitor “told me to go check with medical and you are free to go. I got wheeled into medical in a wheelchair. They did a quick examination of me, told me I was fine.” The candidate said he did not agree. “I said, ‘I think I need to go to the hospital,’” he said. “The chafing was so bad. There was pus coming out of my armpits, out of my waistband. I couldn’t shower because it felt like acid was being poured on me when water hit the chafing. They said, ‘You don’t need to go to the hospital.’ I ended up calling a friend who drove me to the hospital.” 'Something greater than us': Middletown South athletes doing squats to help Navy SEALs At the hospital, the candidate said, he was diagnosed with rabdomiolisis (a breakdown of muscle tissue that releases a damaging protein into the blood), cellulitis (a bacterial skin infection) and dehydration. “They told me my kidneys could have shut down (if he wasn’t hospitalized),” the candidate said. “I ended up staying at the hospital for five days.” He said he knew Mullen through the Navy, and that his death prompted him to voice concern about the post-Hell Week process he experienced. The Navy’s Southwest Region public affairs office did not return multiple emails seeking comment.
