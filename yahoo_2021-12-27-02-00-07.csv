12/27/2021,"The thrill of seeing a great white shark prowling a shipwreck turned terrifying for a Virginia man when he realized the shark was coming straight at him. David Scherrer of Virginia Beach recorded the moment, which he says happened while he was spearfishing about 20 miles off the coast. It shows the cunning shark give the appearance of passing him, then swiftly turn. It then comes straight at Scherrer, and gets within a foot or two of his speargun before turning at the last second. Scherrer keeps the tip of his speargun pointed at the shark, clearly afraid it might attack. “Dove down to 50’, saw this white, thought it was cool at first. Then I started swimming up, (it) started chasing me, and wasn’t so cool anymore,” he wrote on Facebook. “Two things going through my mind as it came at me. 1. Hold your ground/don’t panic. 2. Where do I stab this thing.” Scherrer says his heart was racing as he witnessed a “dream and nightmare at the same time.” It happened Dec. 16 off the northern leg of the Outer Banks, and the shark was about 10 feet long, he told the Virginian Pilot. “Normally when that happens, things end a bit more dramatically,” Scherrer told the news outlet. Winter is when great white sharks migrate down the East Coast to warmer water off the tip of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, experts say. Shipwrecks off the Outer Banks are a popular spot to stop on their journey and feed. Some have been tracked as far as Nova Scotia to the mouth of the Mississippi River, the shark research agency OCEARCH reports. Scherrer’s video has gotten more than 330,000 views on Facebook and Instagram, and 1,400 reactions and comments. Those include some who noted the shark may have considered Scherrer an intruder. “Imagine that, you strolling around the shark’s home and it gets curious and wants to see what your doing there… Funny how that works,” Sean Fallon wrote on Facebook. Others were less sympathetic to the predator, and wondered why Scherrer didn’t pull the trigger in those final seconds. “If it opens its mouth, I shoot,” he wrote on Instagram.

 A man who called into the North American Air Defense (NORAD) Command's annual Santa tracking center and told President Biden ""let's go Brandon"" said he meant it in ""jest."" Jared Schmeck, 35, a former police officer who works for an electric company, called the NORAD line and had a brief conversation with Biden on Christmas Eve. After a brief chat with the president where they talked about what his children wanted for Christmas, Schmeck used a slogan that has become popular among supporters of former President Trump as a veiled insult toward Biden. Schmeck said he meant no disrespect to the president but that he thought he could be doing a better job. ""At the end of the day, I have nothing against Mr. Biden, but I am frustrated because I think he can be doing a better job,"" he said to The Oregonian/Oregon Live. ""I understand there is a vulgar meaning to 'Lets go Brandon,' but I'm not that simple minded, no matter how I feel about him,"" the father told the news outlet on Christmas morning. ""He seems likes he's a cordial guy. There's no animosity or anything like that. It was merely just an innocent jest to also express my God-given right to express my frustrations in a joking manner...I love him just like I love any other brother or sister."" Schmeck told the news outlet he was not a ""Trumper"" calling himself a ""free-thinking American and follower of Jesus Christ."" Schmeck said he and his children call into NORAD every Christmas Eve and that he was unaware that it would be livestreamed or documented. ""I thought it would be automated. We just waited on hold and then they answered,"" he told the news outlet. ""And I thought, 'wow, this is real.' "" At the end of the call, first lady Jill Biden wished Schmeck a Merry Christmas where he responded, ""I hope you guys have a wonderful Christmas as well,"" adding, ""Merry Christmas and let's go Brandon!"" ""Let's go Brandon, I agree,"" the president responded.
