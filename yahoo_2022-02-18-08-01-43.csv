2/18/2022,"Maybe cryptocurrency isn’t “rat poison” after all? Those were once the words of Warren Buffett, the famous investor called the “sage of Omaha” for knowing things before the rest of the market. Now his money is saying otherwise. Specifically, his company Berkshire Hathaway has bought $1 billion worth of stock in a digital bank that focuses on crypto. Berkshire Hathaway made its crypto investment public with a SEC filing earlier this week. It revealed that Buffett’s company had purchased $1 billion in shares of Nubank, a digital bank based in Brazil, and the largest of its kind in Latin America. Nubank is a so-called neobank, a type of bank that operates outside of the rules of the traditional banking system. The digital bank's investment unit, NuInvest, allows users to put money in a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)—tapping a financial space that Berkshire's leaders have shown little love for. Berkshire’s chairman and CEO has not refrained in the past from calling cryptocurrency “rat poison” and an unproductive asset that “has no unique value at all.” Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime partner and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has also hardly been one to shy away from voicing his strong opinions on cryptocurrency. Munger recently stated that he wished cryptocurrency had “never been invented,” and he has even indicated that he would not want any crypto trader marrying into his family. Munger has a particular distaste for Bitcoin, the most popularly traded cryptocurrency, once calling it “disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.” Munger has supported China’s decision to ban Bitcoin trading in the country and has called on the U.S. to take similar measures. “The Chinese made the correct decision, which is just to simply ban them,” he once said. But even though its owners have expressed their personal disdain for cryptocurrencies and the crypto market, Berkshire Hathaway’s latest investment in Nubank is not the first time the conglomerate has dabbled in this market. Berkshire already bought a $500 million stake in Nubank last summer, months before the company went public in December 2021. At the time, Nubank announced that this had been the largest single investment the fintech bank had ever received. As Berkshire was upping its investments into the crypto sphere last year, the company also dropped some of its other, more traditional financial assets. In the same SEC filing that showed the $1 billion investment in Nubank, Berkshire revealed that it had dropped over $3 billion in its shares of Visa and Mastercard. While Buffett and Munger may have a personal distaste for cryptocurrency, the superstar investment pair may be seeing an entirely different kind of opportunity in digital financial service providers like Nubank. There is huge competition among up-and-coming digital banks in Latin America, where a large portion of the population feels underserved by the traditional banking and financial system. Companies like Nubank are looking to tap into a massive potential consumer market of people largely dissatisfied with the existing system. “There is so much opportunity in the [Latin America] region. The combination of a great population, horrible customer experiences, and very high fees, it is unmatched,” Nubank cofounder Cristina Junqueira told Fortune last June. “Worldwide there is no place that is better suited in terms of having a great opportunity for fintech companies to tackle.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•yesterday,"Years after calling Bitcoin ‘rat poison,’ Warren Buffett just invested $1 billion in a crypto-friendly bank",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-just-invested-1-163230481.html
2/18/2022,"Drivers best start bracing for another surge in gas prices amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and years of under-investment by the oil industry, warns one veteran energy strategist. ""My guess is that you are going to see $5 a gallon at any triple-digit [oil prices] ... as soon as you get to $100. And you might get to $6.50 or $7. Forget about $150 a gallon, I don't know where we will be bv then,"" Energy Word founder Dan Dicker said on Yahoo Finance Live. Dicker said oil prices could shoot higher to $150 a barrel, or in line to the ""super spike"" highs from 2007. Oil prices have been red-hot lately as geopolitical tensions rise between Russia and the rest of the world. WTI crude oil has climbed 13% in the past month to $94 a barrel. Russia produces 10 million barrels of oil a day, the equivalent of 10% of global demand. Any loss of that oil due to geopolitical issues could cause a tightly supplied market to become tighter, pushing prices for the hydrocarbon up. The march up in oil has pushed gas prices further higher from already elevated levels. Gas prices are coming off their seventh straight weekly advance, according to data from GasBuddy. The national average is up 16.5 cents a gallon from a month ago and 97.2 cents a gallon from one year ago. The average price nationally for gas currently stands at $3.47. “Not only are oil prices up, but the bulk of the nation is starting the multi-month transition to summer gasoline, further adding to the rise at the pump. In addition, cold weather in Texas last week caused some power outages at major refineries, further weighing on markets. I see no other potentials in the short term but additional price increases unless Russia does an about-face on Ukraine. Even then, we’ll still see seasonality push prices up, so motorists should be ready to dig deeper,"" said Patrick De Haan, Gasbuddy head of petroleum analysis.

2/18/2022,"It’s that time of year: performance and compensation reviews. The good news: More companies are planning to give pay raises that are bigger than 3% this year. The bad: The average raise is not really that high, all things considered. Forty-four percent of companies plan to raise worker pay by more than 3%, according to Payscale’s 2022 Compensation Best Practices Report (CBPR). That’s the highest rate of companies giving more than 3% pay raises in six years. But it still leaves many workers with fairly paltry increases when the dramatic rise in prices over much of the past year is factored in. In fact, about 85% of companies tell Payscale they are worried about inflation, but most aren’t giving pay increases to match it. Last month the annual inflation rate hit 7.5%, according to the latest consumer price index. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com The increasing number of employers dipping deeper into their coffers comes at a time when many are facing worker shortages and high turnover. Last year, nearly half of companies reported the volume of employees quitting was higher than in previous years, according to Payscale, a compensation software and data company. Roughly three out of four companies say they’ve had trouble recruiting to fill those job openings. “The lasting impact of the pandemic on the labor market has shown us that when it comes to pay, employers are scrambling to figure out what to offer new hires and how to structure salary increases to retain their current workforce,” Shelly Holt, chief people officer at Payscale, said in a statement. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com Yet Holt says companies should look at their compensation strategies holistically. It doesn’t just mean pay increases. Nearly two-thirds of employers surveyed by Payscale provided individual bonuses, and 59% awarded company performance bonuses in 2021. Nearly half of companies provided hiring bonuses and spot bonuses last year, according to Payscale. And on the recruitment side of things, 55% had some type of employee referral bonus program in place. Companies also adjusted their 2022 benefits, with about a quarter more employers offering remote work options. A total of 65% of companies surveyed offer this option for workers now. Nearly one in 10 companies even offers a four-day workweek. ​​“What matters most to employees overwhelmingly includes things that enhance their lives, from better benefits that account for both physical and mental health to workplace flexibility and remote work,” she says.

2/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. shares fell the most in almost a year after the data software company reported financial results that illustrated a continued lack of net profit. Most Read from Bloomberg Blinken Offers Lavrov Meeting as Tensions Spike: Ukraine Update Elon Musk Ratchets Up Trudeau Criticism With Hitler Comparison Meme Money That Won Melania Trump NFT Came From Melania Trump Wallet Hong Kong to Test Whole City for Covid With Beijing’s Help S&P 500 Tumbles 2% as Ukraine Jitters Roil Trading: Markets Wrap The stock declined as much as 14% in intraday trading Thursday. Palantir shares have lost about half their value over the past 12 months. The net loss was 8 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings were 2 cents a share, short of analysts’ expectations. Net income is “within eyesight,” Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp assured analysts in a conference call, but he didn’t provide a date. Pandemic-related restrictions are hampering the business, particularly in Europe. The region needs “to reopen,” Palantir Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said in an interview with Bloomberg. “We need to work on Europe,” he said. The number of business customers tripled last year to 147, but most of that came from the U.S. Sankar said he expects to add at least 175 salespeople this year, with many focusing on European businesses. Karp started Palantir with the tech mogul Peter Thiel almost two decades ago to sell software to U.S. government agencies and their allies. The company has worked furiously in recent years, especially during the past year, to bring on more corporate customers. It has added hundreds of salespeople, simplified its software products and even spun up a program to take equity stakes in small startups that agree to be customers. Palantir grew revenue 41% to $1.5 billion in 2021, beating the 40% rate it pledged late last year. Still, Palantir’s government business is larger and growing faster than its commercial segment, a dynamic that has concerned investors since Palantir went public in 2020. Revenue last year from government customers increased 47% to $897 million while commercial increased 34% to $645 million. Deals with biotech startup Dewpoint Therapeutics Inc. and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc. contributed to total fourth-quarter revenue of $433 million. Palantir said it will deliver a 23% adjusted operating margin on $443 million in revenue during the quarter ending in March, falling short of an average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company said it expects its operating margin to increase to 27% in the fiscal 2022. The company’s sometimes-controversial government work remains core to its future operations. Along with assisting more than a dozen governments in battling the Covid-19 pandemic, the software is used to power military operations. “We are not ambivalent about the side we have chosen when it comes to supporting the defense of the United States,” wrote Karp, in his annual letter to shareholders. “Everything we have accomplished, and everything we have built, has been made possible by the country in which our company was founded.” Continuing to expand its commercial segment is critical to sustaining the 30% annual revenue growth Palantir promised investors when it went public, according to Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
