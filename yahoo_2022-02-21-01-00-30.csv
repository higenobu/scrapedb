2/21/2022,"Along with being expected to start a rate hike cycle in March, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to stop purchasing assets to add to its $9 trillion balance sheet. And while multiple rate hikes seems to be largely factored into the stock market, winding down the balance sheet — i.e., start selling assets into the market as opposed to buying — is a less understood variable. “When... the most reliable buyer with its own printing press and an incredible willingness to buy – when they step out of the market, that is a fundamental change to the marketplace,” Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queen’s College at Cambridge University and Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, told Yahoo Finance Live this week (video above). ""So it shouldn't come as a surprise that [stock prices] are lower, because $120 billion a month of asset purchases are disappearing."" El-Erian stressed that unwinding the balance sheet ""need not be disorderly. If you can establish and you still have strong fundamentals, people will come in and take the leg up based on something much more lasting than a liquidity regime. The concern we have is by being late, the Fed also puts economic growth in play. And that means earnings become more uncertain. So that's why this is a very delicate period. There is still a window to get this right. But unfortunately, that window is closing."" The anticipation of increased Fed hawkishness is one of the reasons behind the uptick in volatility this year, with the CBOE Volatility Index averaging more than 23 thus far in 2022 after average of just under 20 in 2021. The MOVE Index, which measures Treasury market volatility, has also seen a more dramatic surge with a 19 percentage point rise so far this year. According to Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, investors have to try to factor in the shrinking of the balance sheet – what she called “a tightening cycle that is unlike any we have seen in the past” – even if it’s uniquely challenging to do so. “Unlike in past periods, they’re not giving us a playbook,” Sonders told Yahoo Finance Live. The Fed isn’t “telling us in advance: Here’s what we’re thinking in terms of balance-sheet shrink, the amount per month. Here’s what we’re thinking in terms of rate hikes. Data dependency is what they’re emphasizing, which means we’re all living day to day in terms of what the data looks like and ultimately how the Fed has to behave."" In terms of relevant data, there are two more important inflation reads before the Fed’s next meeting on March 15 and 16: the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (commonly known as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation) on Feb. 25; and the Consumer Price Index, due on March 10. In any case, El-Erian noted that the stakes are very high — not only in terms of market volatility and a drop in speculative asset prices (which has already been occurring), but also because of potential economic risk. ""In a perfect world, you want people to say this inflation is truly transitory,"" he explained. ""I don't need to change my behavior. But because inflation has stayed high for so long, people are changing their behavior. They're asking for compensation, higher wages, companies are raising prices."" The danger, he stressed, is when companies expect costs to continue to rise and consequently preemptively raise prices for consumers. ""The really dangerous phase is anticipatory — when you feel that to protect your purchasing power, to protect your profit margins, you need to protect against future inflation,"" El-Erian said. ""And that's what the Fed can help avoid is that inflationary expectations become a main driver of inflation."" ""We’re not there yet,"" El-Erian added, ""but if the Fed is not careful, we’ll get there.” Julie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9am-11am ET.

2/21/2022,"Mortgage rates surged to the highest level in two years, leaving homebuyers on high alert as further increases loom. “Things aren’t going back down,” DLB Financial Services CEO Debbie Boyd told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “So we have to quit thinking this is a bubble and just start thinking that this is it now. This is the real thing.” The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage — the most common loan for homebuyers — increased to 3.69% last week from 3.55% the previous week. That’s the highest level since January 2020, according to Freddie Mac, and well above the average of 2.73% a year ago. The surge in rates followed an increase in 10-year Treasury yields, which rose above 2% for the first time since 2019 this week. Solid employment growth for January and a high inflation report are likely to accelerate the Federal Reserve’s plan to increase benchmark interest rates to combat inflation, which is running at a 40-year high. “I think we're going to have three, maybe four hikes this year. Doesn't mean they're all going to be huge,” Boyd said. “But even an eighth of a point, or a quarter of a point does trickle down through the markets, and it makes everybody nervous.” Though recent rate increases have helped fuel homebuyer sentiment to plummet, the housing market has remained red hot. “If you need a new house, you're going to go buy a house. If you're moving across the country and have to relocate, you're going to be buying a house,” Boyd said. “It doesn't matter what the price is.” The average sales price across the country for an existing single-family home rose 14.6% to $361,700 in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. As a result, entry-level homebuyers generally spent up to 25.6% of their household income on mortgage payments, further straining affordability for young buyers. “Real estate markets are caught in a lopsided dynamic with many buyers eager to find the right home before rates rise even higher, but very few available homes for sale as a result of almost a decade and a half of underbuilding,” said George Ratiu, Realtor.com’s manager of economic research. “The benefits that ultra-low interest rates provided over the last two years are wearing off and affordability is becoming a huge hurdle for many buyers.” Still, rates are historically low. By comparison, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage reached an all-time high of over 18% in 1981, according to Freddie Mac. “We are used to now historically low interest rates. I remember when I got a 5.50% rate several years ago, like 10 years ago, and that was a great rate,” Boyd said. “So it's all in what we're used to. We've forgotten that rates were higher than 2% at one time.” While rising mortgage rates will likely price out many young and moderate-income first-time homebuyers, now could be a good time to lock in a rate if you want to refinance or are looking to invest. Homeowners rushed to refinance their mortgages in January during a three-week break from rate increases that added more than a half-point to the 30-year fixed rate last month. “Call it a preemptive strike of getting a refinance in place before mortgage rates run any higher,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, previously told Yahoo Money. Last week’s increase in rates cut down the population of high-quality refinance candidates who could shave three-quarters of a point from their mortgage to 5.1 million, according to figures mortgage technology and data provider Black Knight previously gave Yahoo Money. That’s down from 5.9 million the previous week. So now’s the time to refinance. The same holds true for any real estate investors, Boyd said, before rates climb to 4% in the second half of the year. “So you're going to be buying a little bit more expensive with a little more expensive money. But it's not going to get cheaper,” Boyd said. “So if this is the market you want to get in, you need to get in now.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Money.
