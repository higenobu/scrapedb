3/17/2022,"Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, says the party will assess its internal culture in “an ongoing way” after facing a barrage of questions about whether the late senator Kimberley Kitching was bullied and ostracised by senior colleagues. Marles said on Thursday he understood the “legitimacy of asking questions” about events prior to Kitching’s sudden death at the age of 52. But the Victorian right winger said he had known Kitching for 30 years and the “whole Labor movement is in a state of grief and shock”. Marles told reporters in Hobart he did not accept “assertions that have been in the media” about the way Kitching had been treated, or what subsequent actions she or others might have taken. But he said he did not intend to “get into that debate now” given her family and friends were battling grief. A reporter from The Australian newspaper put it to Marles that he might “be using … eulogies to not answer questions, which is a shameful thing to do”. Marles said he “profoundly” rejected that assertion. “I’d really think about the question that you’ve just asked,” he told the reporter. “I’ve rarely said it in an interview, but that’s offensive”. Since her sudden death of a heart attack last week, friends and allies of Kitching have argued she was effectively ostracised by Labor’s Senate leadership team of Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher, after a series of internal disagreements. Wong and Gallagher have suggested in public commentary they disagree with some of the assertions being made about their behaviour, but have declined to engage in detail, citing respect for Kitching’s grieving friends and family. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Kitching – a longtime player in Labor’s Victorian right faction, and friend and factional ally of Labor’s former leader, Bill Shorten – was also facing a battle to secure preselection to remain in the Senate at the coming election. Because of an extraordinary federal intervention in the Victorian branch of the Labor party, triggered by a significant branch stacking scandal, current preselections in the state are determined by the national executive. The power of Labor’s national executive to determine the fate of individual MPs and senators has caused anxiety in the state branch. Speaking the morning after Kitching’s sudden death, Shorten said she had been under considerable stress. “I’m not a coroner, I can’t tell you why this woman at 52 was taken from us, but I have no doubt the stress of politics and the machinations in the back rooms had its toll”. Marles was asked by a reporter on Wednesday whether Kitching had raised a bullying complaint with him. He did not directly answer the question. He was asked if he knew why the ALP national executive had not endorsed Kitching’s preselection “given even the Dalai Lama has paid his respects to her?” Labor’s deputy leader said pre-selection processes remained under way for a number of positions “which includes the Victorian Senate, which is more than senator Kitching, in the sense that there are more people than just her on the ticket, and that is still a pre-selection to occur”. Marles said Kitching’s life was “not defined by those questions, it’s really not – and in a moment where somebody has passed and where a funeral is to come, it is about thinking about the totality of what someone has done”. Asked whether he believed Kitching’s friends and supporters should be “more sensitive” in the timing of their allegations, Marles said: “I understand people’s grief in this moment”. “But right now the right thing, I believe, in terms of honouring Kimberley Kitching is to be celebrating her life in this moment, doing everything we can, given the shock of the circumstances, and that’s what I’ll be doing”. Kitching’s funeral is next Monday.",News/Australia news,Labor to examine internal culture in ‘ongoing way’ after questions about Kimberley Kitching treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/labor-to-examine-internal-culture-in-ongoing-way-after-questions-about-kimberley-kitching-treatment
3/17/2022,"Parents Chris and Barbara say the vast majority of other parents they meet are supportive of their transgender child and keen to include them in different activities. “There’s a tremendous body of people out there who are looking to contribute to a diverse society, and really willing to do so,” Barbara, who did not want to use her last name, says. “And not just in a quiet, sit on the sidelines way, but in a practical and supportive way. You know, how can I involve you? Would your child like to play cricket? You know, how, what can we do? How can we support you?” That attitude is reflected in a new survey of Australian parents which found 82% support the teaching of gender and sexuality diversity in schools. The Western Sydney University survey, the first of its kind, asked 2,000 parents whether they believe gender and sexuality diversity should be included in classroom discussions. 94% said they wanted relationships and sexuality education delivered in government schools, while a majority wanted to see gender and sexuality diversity introduced in the curriculum in primary school and the early years of high school. Chris says they felt their experiences and views were unrepresented by media discussions of parents’ opinions on the issue. “I think there’s a very strong narrative in the media that seems to be very driven by what the research would suggest is a small proportion of people.” The release of the parents’ survey comes after the New South Wales government confirmed they would oppose One Nation MP Mark Latham’s controversial bill to ban discussion of gender diversity in classrooms. The bill sought to ban the discussion of “the ideology of gender fluidity to children in schools” and prevent schools from supporting transgender students without parental consent. NSW education minister, Sarah Mitchell, released the government’s response to the bill on Wednesday, saying it would “lead to targeted discrimination against a marginalised community which already experiences poorer mental health and wellbeing outcomes”. Chris said they tried to avoid any discussions on the bill, adding that any negative debates around transgender children made them “fearful” for their kids. “It reminds me of all the bad playground experiences that they had, and that they continue to have. So it’s actually really depressing. “But when something like this research comes out, it’s a bit like a beacon of light.” Jacqueline Ullman and Tania Ferfolja, associate professors at WSU’s school of education, authored the report, and told Guardian Australia the survey was significant. “Really, up until this point, we really haven’t had large scale research that actually looked at this topic,” Ferfolja said. “What we’ve mostly heard about is that parents, almost unanimously, don’t want the inclusion of gender and sexuality in the curriculum, and what we’ve found is actually, to the contrary, that actually 82% are supportive.” “I think it’s pretty significant because it pretty much turns the whole debate around on its head. I think Australian parents are overwhelmingly supportive and really believe in equity for students.” Ullman added that much of the discussion of parents’ opinions have been “assumptions,” with little to no previous research on their actual views. “We’ve had lots of outspoken people on both sides of the topic, but most outspoken people, some of whom have been featured in the media, give the impression that all parents feel this way,” she said. “From the responses we had from parents, we can see that many of them think that it is the child’s right to exist in a safe and inclusive space, in addition to having access to information that’s relevant about their health and wellbeing.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The study surveyed 2,000 parents of public school children from kindergarten to year 12, and found broad support for adding discussions of sexuality to relationships and sexual health education. A majority of the parents believed that content covering gender and sexual diversity should be introduced to students by the end of Stage 4 (years 7 and 8). Ferfolja said she hoped the survey would provide a “national baseline” for a more representative discussion of parents’ views of schooling curriculum moving forward. “Kids have a right to be reflected in the curriculum, and to have their voices heard in the curriculum. We can’t just pretend that gender and sexuality diverse kids don’t exist. “They should have equal access, they should be visible and reflected in the curriculum – because we know that kids disengage if they’re not.”",News/Australia news,Survey suggests four in five Australian parents support gender and sexuality diversity education,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/survey-suggests-four-in-five-australian-parents-support-gender-and-sexuality-diversity-education

3/17/2022,"In the spring of 2019, Phil Goldberg, a lawyer and hired gun for a front organisation serving some of America’s most powerful oil firms, spotted an opportunity to serve his masters. The University of Hawaii was holding a conference about a wave of lawsuits against the oil industry, and Goldberg was alarmed the event failed to include representatives from the energy business. So the day before the symposium, he fired off an email to the university demanding that big oil be heard alongside its critics. The event was to interrogate the oil industry’s decades-long cover-up involving the climate crisis. But a one-sided debate, Goldberg wrote, “does students and the general public a significant disservice”. He insisted the meeting be postponed. Denise Antolini, associate dean at the university’s law school who organised the conference, said in her 23-year-career as a law professor, she had never received such demands. “Your request to disrupt our public event was quite surprising, especially coming from far across the continent, from someone I’ve never heard of, on behalf of a private client with an apparently direct financial interest in chilling debate about climate litigation,” she replied. The conference went ahead, but Goldberg chalked up his intervention as a win. He had managed to pressure Antolini into reciting his objections to the conference in her opening statement. He also convinced the university to post his blogs on its website alongside a letter published by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser denouncing the meeting for daring to suggest there was a solid legal case against the oil companies. Goldberg is part of a network of enablers working to preserve big oil’s power and reputation as it faces a barrage of litigation. More than two dozen cities, states and municipalities allege the industry lied to Americans for decades by downplaying and outright denying that fossil fuels caused climate change. The lawsuits demand companies use some of their vast profits to help pay for the human toll of the climate crisis, including the damage brought by rising seas and increasingly severe weather disasters. Desperate to avoid costly settlements, the fossil fuel industry relies on front organisations to discredit the litigation and sway public opinion in its favour. So nearly three years ago, the friends of big oil turned to Goldberg, a former Democratic congressional aide and self-described “committed environmentalist”, to persuade Americans that the companies responsible for the growing climate disaster are now the ones to fix the problem. Though Goldberg heads an ostensibly independent initiative called the Manufacturers Accountability Project (Map), much of its funding comes from some of the biggest names in the oil business. Map hired Goldberg to push back against litigation on the fossil fuel industry’s behalf, allowing oil companies to keep their hands clean in the process. Goldberg is leading a charge in local media to discredit those suing the fossil fuel industry as a “fringe litigation movement” conspiracy of opportunistic politicians, environmental extremists and money-grasping lawyers who pose a threat to the American way of life. “There are two goals of this litigation – drive climate policy and wage a public relations campaign against the energy industry,” Goldberg told the Guardian. “It has no foundation legally and, more to the point, is not the right way to fight climate change.” Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University who specialises in climate litigation, likens the strategy to that pursued by the tobacco industry when it faced litigation over what it knew about cigarettes causing lung cancer. But, she said, the strategy may prove more successful for big oil. “The fossil fuel industry has this ability to really take command of the societal narrative on a whole level that the tobacco industry just didn’t because, although we were definitely a cigarette culture for a time, not everybody was so dependent on cigarettes in the same way we are on fossil fuels,” she said. Kert Davies, founder and director of Climate Investigations Center, is scathing about Goldberg’s part in that. “Phil Goldberg is a useful pawn on a much larger chessboard. If he doesn’t know that, it’s a shame,” Davies said. “If he does know his role, it’s worse.” Outwardly Goldberg seems an unusual bearer of the torch to snuff out climate lawsuits. The New Jersey-born lawyer characterises himself as a “progressive, pro-environmentalist” with a long commitment to Democratic causes. With that, he has positioned himself as a voice of reason as he leads the fossil fuel industry’s campaign to distract Americans from the scene of the crime and embrace big oil as a necessity in the struggle to contain global heating. But Goldberg is also a former coal lobbyist now working as an attorney for a Kansas City law firm – Shook, Hardy and Bacon – that made its name decades ago as the cigarette industry’s attack dog. The legal practice even gained public notoriety for inspiring the fictional law firm of Smoot, Hawking in the satirical book turned film, Thank You for Smoking. Shook, Hardy pioneered a strategy toward avoiding corporate accountability – a denial strategy the oil companies followed not many years later. Starting in the mid-80s, the firm convinced cigarette companies to shut down research into the dangers of nicotine, warning it could be used against them in court. It also hired specialists with advanced scientific degrees to cast doubt on the evidence that smoking causes lung cancer. The firm’s lawyers soon developed a reputation for probing the lives of people who dared to sue the tobacco firms and for using court procedure to draw out cases until plaintiffs ran out of funds. All of this so disgusted one federal judge, Gladys Kessler, that in a damning 2006 civil judgment against the cigarette makers she said Shook, Hardy and other firms played “an absolutely central role in the creation and perpetuation” of a 50-year campaign of deceit. “They devised and coordinated both national and international strategy; they directed scientists as to what research they should and should not undertake; they vetted scientific research papers and reports as well as public relations materials to ensure that the interests of the (tobacco industry) would be protected,” she wrote. “What a sad and disquieting chapter in the history of an honorable and often courageous profession.” The chapter cemented Shook, Hardy’s reputation for vigorously defending clients and drew other contentious industries to the firm. And since joining Shook, Hardy in 2003, Goldberg has lived up to its reputation for playing hardball. Throughout his career, Goldberg has developed an expertise at combatting public accountability lawsuits on the behalf of many embattled corporate clients, including coal companies, the asbestos industry, and pharmaceutical companies accused of medical malpractice. Simultaneously over the last two decades, he has led a wing of the Democratic thinktank, the Progressive Policy Institute, that works to protect corporations from lawsuits and to keep regulatory changes in the hands of politicians who can be influenced by industry money and lobbyists. Goldberg has also advised the rightwing American Legislative Exchange Council on drafting laws to make it harder to sue big corporations. Goldberg’s current defense of the fossil fuel industry is equally focused. He deflects questions about big oil’s cover-up of its own scientific research on global heating by claiming that raking over the past is not going to help find solutions to the climate crisis. He also avoids answering questions about parallels with the tobacco industry’s actions. Instead, Goldberg has sought to nurture a progressive image with claims to be dedicated to the climate fight but concerned that suing oil companies is getting in the way of solutions. He goes out of his way to say that he “cares deeply about climate change” and, in his answers, returns repeatedly to “the important work that needs to be done on the climate”. This image was carried through to the photographs for this article which Goldberg agreed to pose for only while riding his bicycle. He declined to remove his helmet for any of the pictures. Today, Goldberg is at the face of a PR campaign to squash climate litigation against big oil. He calls his strategy the “iron triangle defense”: one side of the triangle is dedicated toward shaping the public narrative, the second is for pressuring legislatures to write laws that discourage corporate accountability litigation, and the third side influences the judicial process with amicus briefs in cases that might have a bearing on those lawsuits. A key part of the iron triangle strategy is that its beneficiaries should not be seen as the ones who are pulling the strings. Corporations fighting legal battles learned long ago that Americans are not particularly trustful of executives in suits. So major industries seek to influence public opinion and political action by funding front organisations to work on the behalf of corporate interests, but under a different name. It was an obvious move for the fossil fuel industry to turn toward front groups as it grew increasingly alarmed in recent years at a surge in lawsuits demanding compensation for damage caused by the climate crisis. Oil executives feared a repeat of the tobacco industry’s fate when public opinion turned sharply against the cigarette makers, forcing the largest civil settlement in US history. Major oil firms, including Exxon, Shell and Chevron, looked to the National Association of Manufacturers (Nam), one of the US’s most powerful business lobby groups with a long history of creating front organizations at the behest of various industries, to help “combat frivolous, politically motivated lawsuits against energy manufacturers”. Four years ago, Nam launched a group, the Manufacturers Accountability Project, to take the campaign in defense of big oil on to the streets and into the local media. A year later, it recruited Goldberg to lead the initiative. While much of their strategy is an attempt to intimidate litigants through the legal process, Goldberg’s role is to take the fight to local communities in an attempt to mould public opinion – and potential jurors – before the cases come to court. From local newspapers to National Public Radio, Goldberg pushes arguments designed to deflect from the fossil fuel industry’s responsibility for the climate crisis. “Those of us who care deeply about climate change, our economy and our way of life must focus our elected leaders on game-changing innovations, not these politically-driven litigations,” he wrote in the New Jersey Globe after three New Jersey senators pressed the state to sue big oil to pay up for the costs caused by their deceptions. Goldberg has pursued similar lines after the attorneys general of Vermont and Connecticut filed cases against the oil industry. “We should be fighting climate change instead of each other,” he reasoned in the local press. Sokol, the law professor and climate litigation specialist, said she saw Goldberg’s intervention tactics everywhere there is a lawsuit against the fossil fuel industry. “Say a new locality files a suit … suddenly the local press is infiltrated with Goldberg quotes. He fires out op-eds,” she said. “It’s a concerted battle against this litigation, which in many ways is a testament to how powerful the industry suspects this could be if it’s allowed to have its day in court.” Still, even in Goldberg’s home state, there are plenty who are not buying it. In 2020, three New Jersey state senators pressed the state to sue big oil to pay up for the past and present costs caused by their deceptions. “Rather than alert the public and help usher in the transition to clean energy, big oil took a page out of big tobacco’s playbook and funded and led a decades-long campaign to lie, deceive, and confuse the public about the science of climate change,” two of the senators, one Democrat and one Republican, wrote in USA Today. “It’s only fair that these fossil fuel companies who got rich while igniting the climate crisis are made to pay their fair share of the costs to our communities.”",News/Environment,The stealth operative for big oil who’s out to derail America’s climate fight,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/17/the-stealth-operative-for-big-oil-whos-out-to-derail-americas-climate-fight
3/17/2022,"Divorces are often messy and almost always emotional. When Major League Soccer’s Columbus Crew tried to leave for Austin a few years ago claiming business problems, a lawsuit stopped them in their tracks. The Los Angeles Rams recently won the Super Bowl, and this past December St Louis – their former home city – received $790m as part of a settlement related to their relocation. Relations sour quickly when a pro sports team up and leaves. Or threatens to. Or the numbers don’t add up. And things between Glendale and the Arizona Coyotes had been on the skids for years when a missed rental payment brought the disorder to national attention at the end of last year. Still, beyond the headlines, the Coyotes and Glendale divorce provides a grim and vivid tale about how things can go south for taxpayer subsidized sports ventures. And often a parting of the ways is best for both sides. First, a brief timeline of the Arizona Coyotes, who just may be cursed: 1996 – the Winnipeg Jets relocate to Phoenix, Arizona. 2003 – the Phoenix Coyotes relocate to nearby Glendale and the Gila River Arena. 2005 – Jerry Moyes buys the team. 2009 – Moyes places the team in bankruptcy. The NHL takes over and signs a short-term lease extension with the City of Glendale. 2010 – An ownership bid to buy the team is derailed by the threat of litigation. 2013 – After the league threatens to relocate the team, Glendale signs a 15-year lease to support a new ownership group: Renaissance Sports & Entertainment. In 2014, they change their name from the Phoenix Coyotes to the Arizona Coyotes. 2015 – Glendale voids the long-term lease after an alleged violation of conflict of interest laws. 2016 – the Arizona Coyotes announce plans to move to the Arizona State University campus in Tempe, a 25-minute drive from Glendale, and build a new arena there. The university subsequently backs out of the deal. 2016 – Glendale enters into a contract for sports entertainment firm AEG to manage the Gila River Arena. Since the team moved south from Canada they have hardly distinguished themselves. The Coyotes have not cracked the top half of NHL attendance since 2001, and have made the playoffs just once in the last nine seasons. This season they sit dead last in the Central Division. Off the ice, things have been even worse. As a rule of thumb, even in taxpayer subsidized private-public ventures, taxpayers seldom know the true state of any pro team’s finances. After all, teams have every reason to plead poverty: they have to negotiate a CBA every few years with the players’ union; they want to maximize leverage when negotiating lease terms with a city or county; and often it’s in a business’s interest to keep profits – which are taxable – as minimal on paper as possible. The Coyotes, though, got dragged into bankruptcy court in 2009 by then owner Moyes, so some facts emerged. And things were very, very bad. Moyes filed documents to support his claim that the team had lost over $70m in the years leading up to bankruptcy, and was on track to lose $45m that season. An audit showed the team had never turned a profit on paper – not all that odd for a modern sports team – but the loss of $54.8m for 2008 was jaw-dropping. One argument, espoused by Moyes, is that the bad sight lines at the America West Arena hurt attendances and ergo the bottom line, placing the team in a hole it could never dig itself out of. Yet after bankruptcy, the team relocated to Glendale and the city ponied up $180m of the $220m price tag for constructing a new arena. Glendale even guaranteed to pay $15m per year in “management fees” to the new ownership group and included a generous provision: if the owners, RSE, accrued more than $50m in losses in five years, they could relocate. Yet not even one year passed before a lawsuit was filed in a dispute over naming rights. Then, Glendale asserted that the city was only earning about $4-5m per year from parking and non-hockey revenue, as opposed to the projected $7-8m. Things were even worse in 2014 as Glendale claimed to be losing money on the deal and the city council voted to terminate the original lease due to an alleged conflict of interest. Supposedly, a city attorney involved in drafting that lease left afterwards to work for the Coyotes. The low revenue for these years is not surprising given that teams need fans to turn up to games if they’re going earn money from parking. NHL teams have 41 or so home games per year. From 2000 to 2004, the Coyotes average attendance was 14-15,000 per game. By 2019, attendance had dipped into the 13,000s. One journalist speculated that the problem was location: Glendale is too far from the more affluent areas of Phoenix. The theoretical suburban hockey mom with her minivan of kids would not make the drive that often to catch a game. In 2016, Glendale signed a contract with AEG to manage the Gila River Arena and the Coyotes issued a statement saying that: “We have a strong relationship with AEG and we are very excited.” In a radio interview, though, the Coyotes president stated that the team wanted a short-term deal. They were publicly eyeing an exit to Tempe, but then newly-elected Glendale city manager Kevin Phelps said he had “not given up on keeping the Coyotes.” The Coyotes had had a chance to submit their own proposal to manage the arena, but failed to submit a bid. Thus, in April 2016 a “Gila River Arena Management Agreement” was signed between the city and AEG Management Glendale LLC. AEG basically took on booking non-NHL events, covering operating costs including hiring, dealing with food and drink sales, ticketing and parking. The key provision, though, stated that AEG shall “negotiate, enter into, administer, amend and terminate all contracts relating to the use of Arena facilities and services, including the Coyotes lease … subject to the prior written approval of the City.” Basically, Glendale hired AEG to play hardball with the Coyotes and turn the stadium into a profitable venture. Season ticket sales were energized in 2019 by the signing of Phil Kessel, but long-suffering fans had not forgotten the gimmicks from yesteryear. Wayne Gretzky becoming a part-owner in 2000 and being inducted into the franchise’s “Ring of Honor”, despite having never suited up for the team. Or the Coyotes signing 40-year-old Brett Hull to a two-year deal for $4.5m and unretiring his father’s Winnipeg Jets number – No9 – for him to wear. Hull’s first season in Arizona was canceled due to a work stoppage, and he played just five games into the second season before retiring. Of course, all professional sports teams deploy gimmicks to attract fans. But the Coyotes’ open flirting with a relocation to Tempe since 2016 “to expand the team’s fan base” increasingly poisoned relations with the city of Glendale. This past summer, Phelps said: “They’ve been talking about moving for years. That really kind of forced us to then contemplate, ‘Well, if they do move what would be our gameplan?” The city commissioned an economic study that found hosting live events and concerts at Gila River Arena would be more profitable than hosting Coyotes games. While housing an NHL team involves keeping the ice frozen and play-ready for several months of the year, the ice is only one inch of brine water and easily covered to make way for concerts. In theory, an arena can host NHL games one night and a concert the next. The massive stumbling block is that the NHL does not release the season’s schedule until late April, and play starts in October. This isn’t such a problem in a huge market like New York or Los Angeles where big acts are desperate to perform and are more likely to adjust to a team’s schedule. But it’s a tougher ask in a place like Glendale, where best-selling artists may not be interested in appearing in the first place. Things got nasty in 2021. Glendale officially announced that the Coyotes year-to-year lease would not be renewed. The Coyotes paid $1.4m in outstanding taxes to the county after the threat of being locked out of their own arena. An email dated 9 December 2021 from ASM Global to Patrick Murphy, the Coyotes president, clarified that the team had issued checks for a total of $999,000 but these were partial payments and the franchise still owed over $2.7m. The email then details a structured payment plan with funds due on 20 December 2021, 31 January 2022 and 1 March 2022. The kicker is in the last few lines in ASM’s email to the Coyotes: “We have endured numerous disputes and have never billed the Team for anything but actual expenses. As you are aware, these game expenses are for actual out-of-pocket expenses that ASM Global incurs on behalf of Team. Banking these expenses is a courtesy, not an obligation of ASM Global.” Via email, Phelps told the Guardian that the Coyotes did make payment for their charges through 31 December 2021. A 20 October 2021 letter to the Mayor of Glendale on Coyotes letterhead from Marina Carpenter, general counsel for the team, memorialized some key meetings but also put forth disputes. For example, she conceded that the Coyotes did not resolve their financial obligations for the 2020-21 season until after the city “graciously waived 100% of the base Arena Rent.” She tried to lay the blame on ASG, claiming they “did not provide sufficient documentation” for invoices. She also noted that the Coyotes had “been forced on numerous occasions to request additional supporting documentation from ASM resulting in payment delays.” These explanations raise the question: why do you need supporting documents for an invoice? Isn’t that the point of invoices? And can’t you pay an invoice, then dispute it later? In a healthy long-term business relationship with mutual trust and goodwill, yes. But not when there’s no sense of commitment, and plenty of penny pinching and finger pointing. There’s no villain in this tale. Glendale has an obligation to the taxpayers, whereas both AEG and the Coyotes are businesses with obligations to maximize profit for shareholders. Glendale spent almost $200m for an arena and their anchor tenant missed payments. That things got nasty, and so brazenly zero-sum, indicates a bad match at the onset. A business was struggling, so who had to cover the losses? Even when the team was winning, attendance was less than spectacular. The Coyotes were publicly hoping for a new $1.7bn arena and entertainment district in Tempe. Instead, in February they signed a three-year deal worth $120m with ASU to play at a 5,000 seater collegiate arena. Even during their worst attendance years in Phoenix and Glendale, the average was well over double that. Fans and armchair economists have to wonder how you can support a professional NHL team with ticket sales and parking revenue effectively capped? Tempe is 11 miles from the population hub of Phoenix, but Glendale is only nine miles away. So will there be any boost from the team’s new location? Glendale, meanwhile, has moved on. The city has announced plans to invest millions in remodeling and upgrading the Gila River Arena. And, of course, having the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals at the nearby State Farm Stadium nearby helped their leverage and bargaining position with the Coyotes. The city never had to depend on the Coyotes to be a golden goose. During the Moyes bankruptcy fiasco, the NHL threatened to relocate the team back to Winnipeg, which in part cajoled Glendale to sign a long-term lease with new ownership. However, after the Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg in 2011 and that threat lost bite, Glendale looked at the books and realized the city was hemorrhaging money. Then they brought in AEG to deal with the Coyotes and professionalize the setup. The NHL has been vaguely supportive of the move to Tempe, with statements about the team’s “long-term” future in the area. However, a short-term lease in a collegiate arena is unsuitable for a pro team. Unless the team gets new ownership with deep pockets who want to pay to build their own stadium, or the proposed Tempe Entertainment District happens soon, the wandering Coyotes may have emerged from bankruptcy only to fall back into a death spiral. With vastly diminished ticketing and parking revenues starting next season, can the team even keep up with bottom-feeders like Buffalo and Ottawa who at least put more than 12,000 fans in the stands each game? Would the league ever contemplate intervening or funneling assistance to the club if current ownership wants to tap out? But these concerns are at least no longer shared with the Glendale or local taxpayers. Any future problems will belong to the Coyotes or Tempe.

As an editorial manager at Penguin Random House, Lee is someone with long experience in instructing copy-editors, proofreaders, indexers, printers and all the other unsung heroes who, if they do their job well, invisibly make the author’s glory seem effortlessly attained. It doesn’t always go well, though; disarmingly, Lee admits to having been “part of a team that managed to print 20,000 copies of The Importance of Being Ernest”. It might once have been said to a greenhorn copy-editor that “the writer is your natural enemy” (attributed, possibly wrongly, to an editor at Time magazine), but a good one can save us from all kinds of embarrassment, and not just on the trivial level of grammar or spelling. As one relates to Lee proudly: “I once worked on a novel in which one of the characters was in the midst of a difficult pregnancy and in the end, in a scene of great tension, gave birth prematurely. By this point, from detailed descriptions of the seasons passing, it was possible to work out that the mother had already been pregnant for 18 months.” Riffling through some old index cards with the contact details of freelance copy-editors of yesteryear, Lee unearths some gems: here’s one who will happily work on “biography, crime, travel, politics”, but – this part underlined – “Not too much poetry”. You can hear the weary sigh echo down the ages. Any bibliophile will find many enjoyable nuggets in the compendium of book chat that follows: from Kurt Vonnegut’s theories about the shapes of stories to the oddest book title of the year prize (2004 winner: Bombproof Your Horse), or Ian Fleming’s productivity tips (write for three hours in the morning and one in the evening, never read over what you wrote yesterday). Lee interviews a host of thoughtful editors, translators, text designers, blurb-composers and other artisans of literary culture, informing us that the collective noun for a group of ghosts (ghostwriters) is, of course, a “fright”, or smartly debunking the supposed romance of the slush pile. “I once looked up the author of a mildly promising slush pile find about French politics,” Lee recalls, “and discovered the author was in prison for strangling his girlfriend.” The most combative chapter, inevitably, concerns punctuation: here Lee madly advises that “British English” has no need for the serial or Oxford comma, but then authors are notoriously precious about these marks of rhythm. As Mark Twain wrote: “Yesterday Mr. Hall [his publisher] wrote that the printer’s proofreader was improving my punctuation for me, & I telegraphed orders to have him shot without giving him time to pray.” Other recurring characters include the splendidly grumpy Gertrude Stein: “a comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it”. Meanwhile, I should like to start a campaign to bring back the manicule (a pointing hand with a cuff) as “the seventh footnote indicator, after the pilcrow”. It remains for me only to express a collegial bafflement with the book’s rhetorical gimmick, which, in defiance of all convention and good sense, insists on always using “words” (as in the title) when it actually means books, or sentences, or prose style, or stories. So, when Lee warns that “bad words are the junk food of the literary world”, she doesn’t mean swearwords but cheap fiction; and when she regretfully explains that sometimes “the words will return to you for pulping”, she means the books, because you literally cannot pulp words. By the time I read: “The application of ‘sense’ to our words is one of the most vital ways they get good,” I was losing the will to live; once informed that “even Hitler was concerned with getting his words better”, I prayed that the author had fatally Godwinned her own scheme; but it went on, relentlessly, to the end. Perhaps, after all, it is a friendly invitation to each reader to take up the blue pencil for themselves.  Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.

3/17/2022,"Those who knew El Limoncito remember a welcoming and industrious community of lime farmers who poured their sweat into the soils of Mexico’s sun-baked backlands in search of a better life. Then the drug conflict exploded and everything changed. The village’s primary school found itself on the frontline of a six-hour Monday morning gunfight that sparked a ferocious two-year struggle for control of the area. As gunmen from two rival cartels – armed with .50-calibre sniper rifles and improvised tanks – fought pitched battles for El Limoncito’s dusty streets, locals fled, leaving behind everything they had. “It was all-out war,” remembered one former resident, who asked not to be named for fear of being killed. El Limoncito’s deserted schoolhouse became a base for fighters from one of the warring factions – then a blood-spattered graveyard after their enemies stormed its classrooms in an attempt to retake the village. Family homes became makeshift forts used to spray invaders with gunfire. The pale yellow chapel was peppered with bullets and robbed of its flock. “It’s appalling – we’re in the middle of a war we never asked for,” said Father Gilberto Vergara, a Catholic priest from Aguililla, the surrounding municipality in the western state of Michoacán. Vergara said it was impossible to know how many were killed in the battle for El Limoncito since the gunmen carried their fallen comrades back into the hills. But the carnage left crystal clear the intensity of the conflict raging in Mexico’s hinterlands after decades of state abandonment and cartel control. “The bullets are real – and they kill,” the priest lamented. “The war between them is a war in every sense of the word – and this is a battlefield. “The toll goes far beyond the bullets you see on the ground,” Vergara reflected. “You look around and see the abandoned crops. The people gone. Areas where people lived happily have become regions of fear.” Fifteen years have passed since Mexico’s then president, Felipe Calderón, launched the ill-fated “war on drugs” here in the Tierra Caliente (Hot Land) – a strategically positioned sweep of mountains and river valleys that has been a major hub of drug trafficking and production since the 1980s. Calderón vowed in December 2006 to obliterate Mexico’s mafias, “for the new generations of Mexicans who have the right to a safer and better Mexico”. “We will give neither truce nor quarter to the enemies of Mexico,” he told thousands of troops tasked with blitzing the cartels. Fast-forward to 2022, however, and little seems to have changed, bar the names of some of the cartels and kingpins locked in a vicious squabble for control of smuggling routes like the one on which El Limoncito has the misfortune to lie. Hipólito Mora, a lime farmer famed for helping launch Mexico’s “self-defense” vigilante movement nearly a decade ago, claimed today’s situation was even worse than in 2013 when he urged residents to take up arms against the Knights Templar cartel. “Things are so bad that here in the capital Morelia … there are four, five, six, sometimes even seven murders a day,” Mora complained, as rifle-toting bodyguards guarded the hotel where he was holding court over a cup of chamomile tea. “If this is happening in Morelia, which is full of security forces, just think what’s happening in other municipalities,” Mora added. El Limoncito, three and a half hours south-west of Morelia, has been turned into a ghost town by the two-year turf war between a coalition of crime groups called the Carteles Unidos and the fast-growing Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG) whose leader, El Mencho, was born nearby. Every single one of the bungalows on the village’s rocky main drag is vacant, each empty room filled with reminders of heartache and horror. An abandoned game of Monopoly, a class photo from a school now in ruins, a copy of the Burt Reynolds family comedy Cop and a Half, a toothbrush and a mouldy jalapeño pepper on a Styrofoam tray. The derelict residence of a watermelon farmer – one of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans uprooted by violence in recent years – is guarded by a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe. But the Virgin’s face and hands appear to have been shattered by gunfire and the wooden door lies open. Inside, gangsters have scrawled their groups’ names on to a bookshelf in red ink and what looks like blood. Spent .50-calibre cartridges litter the undergrowth outside, the markings suggesting they came from an ammunition plant in Missouri. El Limoncito’s chapel resembles a planetarium: its sanctuary dotted with constellation-like specks of light as the sun pours in through dozens of bullet holes in the walls and roof. In the creche, an intruder has scribbled a tribute to one of Mexico’s most wanted men. “100% behind The Lord of the Roosters,” it says, in reference to El Mencho’s nickname. Dusty copies of Grimms’ Fairy Tales share school classrooms with bullet-pocked whiteboards and walls. Green and red smiley faces remember the children in the teacher’s good or bad books when class last sat. José, Juan and Miguel had been naughty. Itzamara and Byron had been nice. Mexican soldiers who had occupied the area the previous week urged reporters not to venture into the fields beyond the village’s last home, where a machete lay beneath orange and purple graffiti exalting the Jalisco cartel. Three days earlier an elderly farmer had died in the next village after stepping on an improvised landmine. The region’s untended groves were rumoured to be strewn with such devices. Six days after those troops arrived there was an edgy calm, as soldiers set up camp in the school. Cartel triggermen had abandoned their roadblocks and retreated into the mountains to avoid a confrontation. Humvees mounted with Minimi machine guns patrolled the highway that is used to move vast quantities of drugs through Mexico and on to the US. Anxious locals fretted that the expulsion of one cartel might simply clear the way for another to seize power, noting how security forces had served such a purpose in the past. In Aguililla, a picturesque town 25 miles to the south, troops had occupied the main plaza and were offering free haircuts and check-ups in an effort to win over a community that has spent decades under cartel control. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised to fight crime with “hugs, not bullets” – and here was his flagship policy in action. A yellow army banner hung from the town’s bandstand offering “chats to avoid the proliferation of the use of firearms”. “You can’t put fire out with fire,” the president, best known as Amlo, said recently in defense of his attempt to bring peace with social programs not deadly military raids. Calderón sends in the army Mexico’s “war on drugs” began in late 2006 when the president at the time, Felipe Calderón, ordered thousands of troops onto the streets in response to an explosion of horrific violence in his native state of Michoacán. Calderón hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico’s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed. Kingpin strategy Simultaneously Calderón also began pursuing the so-called “kingpin strategy” by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders. That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps – notably Arturo Beltrán Leyva who was gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009 – but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie. Under Calderón’s successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, the government’s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world’s most murderous mafia groups. But Calderón’s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa’s Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. When “El Chapo” was arrested in early 2016, Mexico’s president bragged: “Mission accomplished”. But the violence went on. By the time Peña Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain. ""Hugs not bullets"" The leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime, offering vocational training to more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels. “It will be virtually impossible to achieve peace without justice and [social] welfare,” Amlo said, promising to slash the murder rate from an average of 89 killings per day with his “hugs not bullets” doctrine. Amlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong ""National Guard"". But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants. Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office. Father Vergara was skeptical such tactics alone would work in a region so immersed in violence. “I agree with Amlo on many things. He says he’s a pacifist and I consider myself a pacifist too. But I also believe that you react to what you have before you. Hugs? Yes, I’d hug someone who comes in peace and is calm. But if someone is fighting me with a gun in their hand, I’ll disarm him first and then be able to give him a hug.” Mora, the former vigilante leader, voiced satisfaction troops were “liberating” areas such as El Limoncito from cartels whose armories now include explosive-laden drones and Frankenstein-like tanks known as “monstruos”. But he also doubted López Obrador would succeed where previous presidents had failed. “I don’t believe there’s any way of putting an end to such violence in the short term,” Mora admitted, noting horrifying levels of bloodshed in states such as Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Colima – not to mention the resort city of Cancún near to where a British businessman was shot dead last weekend. “It’s incredible – not even the beach is safe these days,” Mora said. In some Michoacán farming communities such as Pareo, just north of the hot land, locals have long since abandoned hope of government protection and again created their own heavily armed militias to keep out the cartels. “Here we love life … Out there it’s fucked up,” said a vigilante commander as he showed off one of more than 80 pillbox-style fortlets his troops use to defend Mexico’s avocado-growing heartlands from the narcos. Amlo has celebrated the army’s hot land occupation and said displaced families are starting to return home – but locals dispute official claims the army is now completely in charge. “They’ve made themselves present – but taking control will require much more work,” said Vergara. “Are the organized crime groups no longer here? No – it’s just that we can’t see them. They haven’t just suddenly evaporated. They are people – and they are somewhere.” The priest was right. Three weeks later, the cartel killers reappeared, shooting Aguililla’s mayor dead in broad daylight near its occupied main square. As mourners packed the town’s 19th-century church to lament Mexico’s 21st-century ordeal, Vergara fought back tears and urged them to seek solace in God. “What we have always asked for, and ask for now, with such faith … is that this killing stops,” the priest said before the mayor was buried to the sound of mariachi. A few miles out of town, residents had built a roadside shrine to Jude the Apostle, the patron saint of desperate cases and lost causes. “Most holy apostle,” said the prayer painted on its side. “Make use, I implore thee, of the special privilege that has been granted to thee, of bringing quick and visible help when all hope has been lost.”",News/World news,Battle-scarred ghost town bears mute witness to Mexico’s drug wars,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/mexico-ghost-town-drug-wars-limoncito
3/17/2022,"The Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has become the latest footballer to have his house burgled while he was playing in a high-profile game. The French international described the five-minute break-in as “our family’s worst nightmare” and said his children were asleep in their bedrooms at the time. Pogba said he discovered he had been burgled minutes after Manchester United’s Champions League defeat to Atlético Madrid at Old Trafford on Tuesday, a game in which he had appeared as a second-half substitute. He tweeted: “The burglars were in our home for less than five minutes but in that time they took from us something more valuable than anything we had in our home … our sense of safety and security.” He added: “This occurred during the final minutes of last night’s match when they knew that we would not be home. My wife and I rushed home not knowing if our children were safe and unharmed. “As a father there is no feeling worse in this world than not being there to protect your children and I sincerely hope that no one ever has to feel what I felt last night.” Pogba also offered a reward to “anyone who has a clue to help us”. pic.twitter.com/O3hocLUh51 Pogba’s United teammate Victor Lindelöf was the victim of what he described as a “very traumatic” break-in at his house as he played against Brentford in January. The Swedish defender’s home was targeted while he was in London, forcing his wife to lock herself and their two children in a room for safety during the burglary. In February 2019 the house of the Liverpool striker Sadio Mané was burgled when he was playing in a Champions League game against Bayern Munich. During another Champions League match in 2007, the home of the Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard was also targeted. His wife, Alex, confronted the gang who demanded she hand over jewellery and the contents of a safe or else they would “take her kids”.
