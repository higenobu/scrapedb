5/19/2022,"The crypto crash will not reduce the sector’s climate impact any time soon, an economist has warned, even though the environmental footprint of digital currencies is in theory set by their market value. “Unless bitcoin collapses further, there’s no reason to expect a decrease in environmental impact,” said Alex de Vries, a data scientist at the Dutch central bank and the founder of Digiconomist, which tracks the sustainability of cryptocurrency projects. His research shows that while the increase in a cryptocurrency’s price encourages more computer capacity to be dedicated to it – increasing carbon emissions – that capacity takes a long time to disappear after the value declines, so the climate impact persists. Cryptocurrencies work by validating their transactions through huge numbers of “miners”, who use their computers to solve extremely complex maths problems in exchange for the chance of getting tokens as a reward, in a highly energy-intensive process. De Vries estimates that the bitcoin network currently uses around 204 terrawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year, around the same as the energy consumption of Thailand and above that of all but 23 sovereign nations. Other cryptocurrencies add to that footprint: ethereum, the token that underpins the NFT boom and the “decentralised finance” sector, has an annualised footprint of around 104TWh (equivalent to Kazakhstan, more than all but 34 nations), while even dogecoin, a lighthearted spinoff of bitcoin famed for its community’s positive attitude, consumes an estimated 4TWh annually. Those figures have barely changed over the past month despite $1tn being wiped off the crypto sector, and other measures of the amount of processing power devoted to “mining” similarly show little decline. All major cryptocurrencies use electrical power in rough proportion to the price of the token because that dictates how much the reward given to miners is worth. For bitcoin, for instance, the reward for successful mining is 6.25 bitcoin every 10 minutes – currently, around $210,000. The higher the value of the reward, the more energy it is worth using to try to win it, ensuring that as the price of bitcoin rose from $8,000 in October 2019 to $60,000 two years later, the energy use of the sector rose too, from 73TWh to its current high. But while an increase in the price of cryptocurrency quickly leads to an increase in the carbon emissions of the sector, a crash like the one seen in past month doesn’t do the reverse. “It likely stops the environmental impact from going up any further,” said de Vries, “but a bitcoin price of $25,200 is sufficient to sustain an annual electricity consumption of 184TWh.” A stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 per token. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price. Others, known as ""algorithmic stablecoins"", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don't collapse. Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens. That’s because the cost of cryptocurrency mining is split over two main areas: buying the hardware, and paying for electricity. When prices are on the rise, miners buy new computers – expensive graphics cards for ethereum, or purpose-built “rigs” for bitcoin – but once they are already set up, it’s only worth switching them off when the cost of electricity alone is higher than the expected revenue. In a paper published in the journal Joule last year, de Vries estimated that a massive crash in the price of bitcoin, back down to $8,000, would be required to meaningfully reduce the total emissions of mining – and even then, it could sustain an energy consumption of up to 60TWh per year. The continued turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets means the sector may have further to contract. On Wednesday morning, tether, a stablecoin that effectively functions as a bank, paid out a further $1.5bn to depositors withdrawing their cash from its coffers. In the past week, the slow-motion bank run has seen $9bn of its reserves withdrawn, more than 10% of its total market cap and well over twice the cash-on-hand it declared it had at the beginning of the year. Andreessen Horowitz, a prominent venture capital firm and one of the key financial backers of the cryptocurrency sector, said on Tuesday that we may be entering a “crypto winter”, echoing a warning from the Coinbase chief executive, Brian Armstrong, that valuations may be depressed for some time.",News/Technology,"Crypto crash unlikely to reduce its climate impact, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/18/crypto-crash-unlikely-to-reduce-its-climate-impact-expert-says

5/19/2022,"You’d think a person would remember why they were admitted to intensive care and nearly died, even if that person was a politician, with one of those notoriously short memories. In April 2020, just over two years ago, Boris Johnson could have become our late prime minister. Another life snuffed out by Covid-19 to add to the daily death toll. Others in his circle caught the virus, but for him it was nearly fatal – in part because his obesity made him highly vulnerable to the disease. Johnson himself said this. It’s not a matter of debate. In the aftermath, and to his credit, he launched another anti-obesity strategy. There have been a lot of them, but more on that later. This time, the government’s proposals looked promising, aimed at curbing the heavy marketing of junk food that ends up in children’s stomachs and turns into the internal fat that surrounds adult organs, causing chronic illnesses. I’ve seen the X-rays. It’s not pretty and it kills. And this grim spiral costs NHS England at least £6bn a year. Experts agree that it’s the easy availability and low cost of highly calorific, sugary, salty, fatty food that has to be tackled if obesity is to be reduced. The supermarket shelves loaded with biscuits and sweets and crisps. The takeaway outlets with high calorie ready meals swimming in grease. Telling individuals to just lose weight is no good at all – and unfair. The highest numbers of overweight and obese people are found in the poorest and most deprived communities. It’s the devil’s own bargain: unhealthy food is tasty and cheap. People are used to eating pies or fried chicken and chips, filling up between meals with salty or sugary snacks. We develop the taste for such foods, the kids clamour for them, and so many families short on money buy processed food and skip the fruit and vegetables, which cost more. Junk food is heavily promoted and discounted. That was what Johnson pledged to tackle in the wake of his hospital stay. But now the government is dragging its feet over some of the key measures that everyone applauded when the strategy was introduced in July 2020. The ban on multi-buy offers, such as BOGOF (buy one, get one free) deals on foods high in fat, salt or sugar, is postponed until October next year – 12 months after it was supposed to come in. The other key measure, a ban on online adverts to children and TV advertising of such foods before the 9pm watershed, is delayed until January 2024. Why? Because families are struggling with the cost of living, says the government. And to give industry “time to prepare”. The implication is clear: deprived families should carry on buying cheap junk food that endangers the health of their children. Health campaigners are in despair. They have been calling for these particular measures for decades now, only to see them snatched away at the 11th hour. “Our appetite cannot cope with what food companies are throwing at it. We are programmed to seek out calorie-dense food, and we eat too much of it and it’s making us sick,” said Henry Dimbleby, the independent author of the government’s national food strategy. But it’s not just health campaigners who are raising the alarm. Senior Tory politicians are lining up to condemn this delay, which they know could well be a permanent U-turn. William Hague denounced the change of plan in the Times as “intellectually shallow, politically weak and morally reprehensible”. One in five children are obese by the time they are 11, “their chances of living a long and healthy life already impaired,” he said. He called it a national disgrace. Lord Bethell, a Tory minister at the Department of Health until September last year, called the delay “unconservative” and suggested it would be hard for the bans to be put into force now before the next election. Also writing in the Times, he said that without good health, people could not fulfil their potential. “They are less economically productive, less able to create and care for a family, more likely to need medical and financial support from the state, and more likely to die young.” He was concerned, too, he said, at the burden imposed by obesity on the NHS. Obesity massively increased in the 1980s, in Thatcher’s “have it all” Britain. The seminal Foresight report on its causes and effects in 2007 laid out what every investigation since has confirmed, that changes are needed to our whole food environment. But no government has done enough. Too many voluntary agreements have been made with the food industry. Too few restrictions on sales and promotions have been enforced. One obesity strategy after another has failed to deliver. A Cambridge study published last year identified 14 government-led obesity strategies in England from 1992-2020, containing 689 wide-ranging policies. And still the overweight and obesity figures rise. The latest delays are unpardonable. If the government is really worried about struggling families’ bills, then do something to help them buy better food. Subsidise fruit and vegetables and real ingredients. Make simple healthy meals cheaper and slap tax on junk food, as they successfully did on sugary drinks. The savings to the NHS and increased productivity from a healthier workforce would amply repay the cost. It’s frankly immoral to let the nation’s children sleepwalk into an adulthood of health problems and shortened lives. The next generation deserves so much more.

5/19/2022,"The idea of the Pope’s O’Rangers playing in a Big Vase final seemed utterly absurd as recently as five years ago. Having just seen his team knocked out of the qualifiers by Progrès Niederkorn, the fourth best team in Luxembourg, the then-O’Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha was subsequently seen remonstrating with angry fans while standing in a bush, a state of affairs that correctly suggested his reign was doomed a month before the fitba season proper had even started. How things change. On Wednesday night in Seville, O’Rangers will line up against Eintracht Frankfurt for the final of this season’s competition, one in which they’ve already knocked out two much better Bundesliga teams. And in the sizzling heat of Andalusia, upwards of 150,000 Gers fans are seeking sanctuary in the shade of the local orange trees before what is arguably the biggest game in what some cynics view as the club’s proud nine-year history. But The Fiver has long been of the view that if it looks like O’Rangers, sounds like O’Rangers and plays like O’Rangers, then it’s definitely O’Rangers and there’s little to separate them and their opponents going into this decider. “A Scottish club getting to [Big Vase] final?” mused veteran keeper Allan McGregor. “It shouldn’t really happen, should it? Let’s be honest.” Speaking on the wireless from Seville, O’Rangers royalty and Scottish national treasure Ally McCoist could barely contain his giddiness, promising the bevvies would be on him should his former club win at the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium. “I am going to throw my wallet to the crowd if we win tonight,” he promised. “I am going to throw credit cards about. It will be deep joy.” If the scenes of carousing being beamed into Fiver Towers from Spain are anything to go by, Ally could be bankrupt by this time on Thursday. It is heartwarming to see then that, thus far, all who have travelled from Scotland are enjoying themselves while keeping tomfoolery to a bare minimum. With around 50,000 Frankfurt supporters also in Seville, not to mention the handful of Queen’s Celtic fans who still haven’t made it home from their final against Porto in 2003, the local constabulary are on high alert. “I know we have a lot travelling with us,” said O’Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst. “We have to enjoy the occasion, but make sure we are not causing any problems. Half the people will go home really happy and half will not, but we should respect the whole city and people working hard to accommodate us and not leave anything negative behind.” Anything, that is, apart from Coisty’s credit cards, which could end up behind several different bars.

Peel’s family said in a statement: “John/Dad was in a position to have access to many of the most celebrated people and events in the history of popular music. This is reflected in a wealth of souvenirs he collected. In going through the accumulation of 40 years of pop music moments, we decided that some of the most interesting items might find a home, with fans of his programme or of the artists whose music he played.” Among the other items up for auction in Live in Session: Property from the John Peel Archive are a handwritten letter signed by David Bowie, a 7in of Nirvana’s 1988 single Love Buzz/Big Cheese and the BBC Radio 1 DJ’s horn gramophone, which sat on his desk at the family home in Suffolk fondly known as Peel Acres. The Lennon/Ono pressing is estimated to sell for between £15,000 and £20,000. Katherine Schofield, director of Bonhams’ popular culture department, said: “John Peel had an incredible impact on the new music landscape. Without his passionate advocacy of emerging talent, generations of music lovers may never have heard the sounds of the Fall, the Undertones, Sex Pistols, and countless others. “This collection, offered directly by the family, comprises some of Peel’s most collectible and rare records, spanning decades in music – many of which are accompanied by letters from the artists or their management.” Peel died of a heart attack in 2004, aged 65. He was one of the longest-serving Radio 1 DJs, appearing on the station from 1967 until his death. He was known for his uncontainable and adventurous music tastes and for his particular patronage of artists including PJ Harvey, Captain Beefheart, Pulp and the White Stripes. Trademarks of his BBC Radio 1 show included the live Peel Sessions and the annual Festive Fifty countdown of Peel’s favourite songs of the year. In 1998, he was named an OBE for services to British music. He also ran a record label, Dandelion Records, from 1969 to 1972, was a regular presenter on Top of the Pops in the 1980s, and wrote a memoir, Margrave of the Marshes, which was completed by his wife, Sheila Ravenscroft, after Peel died while on holiday in Peru.

5/19/2022,"Boris Johnson’s row with the EU over Northern Ireland’s Brexit arrangements is “absolutely solvable” but only if the UK accepts that a border is inevitable, the former head of the World Trade Organization has said. But Pascal Lamy said the prime minister could only achieve a breakthrough if he stopped mixing “oil and vinegar” and throwing emotional Brexit politics on to what he said was essentially a technical problem. Lamy said he did not understand the UK’s strategy, which risked a trade war with the EU, but added that it was unlikely to come to this as the “cost-benefit ratio” was “ridiculous”. If matters did deteriorate and the EU retaliated with sanctions, the bloc would win as those with greatest capacity for trade generally did, Lamy said. His comments, in an interview with the Guardian, came after the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, threatened new laws to allow the UK to change some of the Northern Ireland protocol. The UK government has come under pressure from the Democratic Unionist party and the Traditional Unionist Voice, both of whom campaigned on an anti-protocol ticket in the recent Northern Ireland assembly elections. Lamy, who has followed Brexit closely over the past seven years, and who is now president of the Paris Peace Forum, a French non-profit organisation, after leaving the WTO in 2013, said demands to remove the border in the Irish Sea completely would never deliver a breakthrough. “I don’t understand exactly what they [the UK] are after,” he said. “If it is no border it won’t work. You cannot leave the EU and not have a border. That’s just having your cake and eating it. “So there is a question mark as to what exactly is the problem on the UK side. If it is ‘we don’t want a border’ then it is like saying: ‘We don’t want Brexit.’ Then this is unsolvable.” Lamy continued: “The UK government has this capacity to mix problems and to cook a political soup. “These are oil and vinegar issues between emotion and technicalities. Emotion is extremely high because Boris Johnson keeps beating the drum to say Brexit is a great thing. He has to increase the sound of the drum to say Brexit is a great thing all the time.” If the UK admitted a border was the direct consequence of Brexit, then a solution could be found, Lamy said. There could be a dynamic solution for Northern Ireland, he suggested. This would involve a “thin border” with few checks on trade across the Irish Sea while the UK remained aligned to EU standards. This would become a “thick border” if the UK wanted to diverge from those standards, Lamy added. This solution would require equivalence in standards with the EU and has already been rejected by the UK as unacceptable because it would compromise the country’s control of its own laws. Lamy said this went to the core issue of borders between nations and always involve tradeoffs. “The UK are torn between their political position, which is they want to have the capacity to diverge [on standards], and the technical consequence of that, which is a thicker border,” he said. The only way to solve the issue was to “dial down the emotion” and “let the technicians find the solution that allows both sides to find a midway between a thick and a thin border”. Given the border between the UK and the EU was not negotiable, the UK’s best shot at a solution was to “play for time, as you can’t play with money”, Lamy said. Solutions included trusted trader schemes that would would “transport the border up the value chain” and light-touch checks at ports. “Customs officers only have a limited amount of time in the day. It’s about finding a compromise between ensuring control on one side and trade to flow on the other,” Lamy said. He played down the UK’s threat to legislate to “disapply” some of the protocol if the EU did not concede to Johnson’s demands, saying he found it difficult to believe the UK and the EU would end up in a trade war. “If there was one, the EU would win as generally the one that has the largest trade capacity prevails,” Lamy said. With war in the Ukraine and Sweden and Finland making the momentous decisions to join Nato, Brexit was an “irritant” to EU leaders, he added.",News/Politics,"UK must accept border on Irish Sea is inevitable, says ex-WTO chief",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/uk-has-to-accept-border-irish-sea-inevitable-ex-wto-chief-pascal-lamy-brexit-boris-johnson
5/19/2022,"Are we finally getting some good disability representation in fiction? Certainly, the publishing industry seems to have belatedly recognised the need to get disabled writers through the door. After a successful social media campaign, Amazon has recently introduced a “disability fiction” section. The Society of Authors now has a dedicated peer network for disabled and chronically ill writers. And in 2020, the Barbellion prize was set up to reward brilliant work by disabled authors. But does any of this mean that disabled people are finally seeing themselves and their experiences in the novels they pick up in Waterstones? It depends where you look. Children’s literature is definitely getting better at representation. Indeed, when I asked disabled friends and acquaintances to name their favourite disabled character, almost all of them highlighted books aimed at younger readers, like Elle McNicoll’s A Kind of Spark. Lizzie Huxley-Jones, who is disabled herself, says that through her work as a children’s author and sensitivity reader she is seeing signs of progress. “Even just in the last three years in the UK – probably five if I’m being extremely generous – I feel like there has been a big push around securing autistic talent, publishing autistic stories, which I think is great because, historically, autistic people really didn’t get to tell our own stories.” While she acknowledges that there are still overlooked dynamics – characters with chronic pain, for example, or disabled kids of colour – she attributes the recent progress to a recognition that children deserve to see themselves reflected in the stories they read. There’s also the simple fact that a lot of kids’ books centre on a group of friends, rather than one protagonist, which creates space for more diversity. Huxley-Jones hasn’t seen the same commitment to representation in the adult literature sector, where she says disability is still seen as a niche topic. While there are some novels with disabled characters out there, a concerning number of them stick to damaging tropes – perpetuating stereotypes rather than portraying disabled people with the same depth and complexity as other characters. As Cat Mitchell, a lecturer in writing and publishing at the University of Derby, puts it, there’s either “a tragedy narrative where the character dies at the end, or a narrative where either the person miraculously recovers or it’s discovered that their disability or illness was fake all along”. Several of the people interviewed for this article pointed to Jojo Moyes’s Me Before You as the ultimate example of the problem: the main character becomes disabled and then – spoiler alert – kills himself. “Not only are these narratives not realistic,” Mitchell says, but “they’re never written as if there are disabled people in the audience. It’s that nondisabled gaze that they are writing for, which is really problematic.” She is equally disparaging of triumph-over-adversity narratives, in which a disabled person’s struggles in an ableist world are used to make a nondisabled audience feel lucky by comparison. These tired stereotypes are exactly what Victoria Scott, who co-led the campaign for the Amazon disability section, set out to tackle with her fiction. Her debut novel, Patience, drew on her relationship with her nonverbal sister to explore the complex ethical questions that will come with a future in which genetic conditions can be cured. “I wrote it from the family’s perspective,” she says, but she purposely gave the disabled character a distinct and idiosyncratic voice. “I feel like society pushes people like my sister into the shadows, and it doesn’t acknowledge them … so when I wrote Patience, I wanted her to be an awesome character. She’s funny. She’s a bit sweary. She’s a massive Take That fan. And she’s got all these different parts of her personality. She’s a really interesting, multifaceted human being.” Scott’s determination to portray the inherent value of disabled life is in stark contrast to all the stories in which disability is a byword for worthlessness. Books like Scott’s, which put disability front and centre, are important in an industry that undervalues these stories and sees them as niche rather than universal. Scott wanted to create the Amazon category to dispel this idea, and to encourage other authors to write stories that treat disability as interesting and worthy of artistic attention. Equally important, says Mitchell, is “incidental representation,” where a character “just happens to be disabled and it’s not really central to the plot”. This is almost unheard of in adult fiction, she says. The reasons for this lack of representation are varied, but Mitchell and Huxley-Jones point to the inaccessibility of publishing as an industry. Hours are long and, for authors, pay is often delayed. Much depends on making contacts at long and inaccessible conferences. And because publishers pay an advance for a book long before they make money from it, they are incentivised to stick to narratives and characters they already know will sell. So it probably shouldn’t be surprising that we see the same tropes again and again. Yet, the increasing diversity of children’s literature shows us that change is possible. If we can recognise that disabled kids deserve to see themselves represented in books, we must surely be able to recognise that disabled adults deserve the same. After all, disabled kids grow up. Hopefully, developments such as the new Amazon disability category and the Barbellion prize will encourage authors and publishers into the huge space disability representation could occupy. Diverse stories are important.

5/19/2022,"Towards the end of Brad Birch’s reimagining of Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People, farmer Patrick places a water bottle in the centre of the stage and invites fracking enthusiast and local MP Mick Powell to take a sip. He smirks and hesitates. It is a tense, briefly thrilling moment. While it is a tidy retelling of the source narrative, it is unfortunate that not much else in Birch’s adaptation nor in Joe Murphy’s staging comes close to being equally compelling. Birch relocates Ibsen’s original narrative to an unnamed town in present-day Mid Wales. It is an intriguing conceit: with Mick’s support, fracking company Westra are testing potential gas sites. Jobs and regeneration wealth are promised, until an explosion at the site begins to pollute the water table bringing Mick into conflict with Rhiannon, his sister and local GP. It is never clear whether A Hero of the People is a contemporary tale of political corruption set in a specific location, or if it is supposed to function as a parable. It aims to be both, perhaps, but such ambiguity is unpersuasive. Vaguely local while straining for universalism, it is undermined by banalities and illogical exposition that are at odds with its supposed reality. For example, if this is a contemporary world where the deletion of a corporate tweet is a significant plot point, it is never clear why the pages of a local newspaper appear to still be the only method of disseminating local information (or what the significance of this might mean in 2022, considering the perilous state of much local journalism). It is telling that the play is most persuasive in scenes that are wholly original, whereas much else falls between two dramatic stools.But if the play fails to convince, the performances often do. As Mick, Oliver Ryan is pleasingly slimy and, as his daughter Hannah, Mared Jarman offers a compelling emotional counterpoint. The excellent Suzanne Packer stirringly imbues Rhiannon with a convincing gravitas, even when her character has to resort to emotional histrionics, and Catrin Stewart as editor Elin Tate and Pal Aron as Patrick are great in two underwritten roles.

5/19/2022,"UK inflation is running at 9% in May, driven by sharp rises in the price of gas and electricity, food and transport costs. Among the groups hardest hit by the rising cost of living are pensioners, who are often on a fixed income and tend to spend more on home energy bills than other households. In April the state pension went up by 3.1%. The average energy bill of just under £2,000 is 20% of the £9,627 a year paid through the new state pension. Becky O’Connor, the head of pensions and savings at the website interactive investor, said: “It is asking the impossible to expect people on low, fixed incomes, including the UK’s more than 11 million pensioners, to shoulder such [price] increases. A high proportion of the UK’s 66 and over population are dependent on the state pension alone.” We heard from Guardian readers who are trying to keep up with rising costs. Suzanna, a retired teacher from London, has changed what she eats to help reduce her spending. “The cost of food means I buy less and have a basic diet,” she says. “I don’t [use the oven], because you worry about how much energy does the oven use. I normally eat very healthily. I’m going round looking at things that maybe I can just stick in the microwave because they’re cheaper. Even boiling vegetables, it takes quite a long time.” The 78-year-old lives in a block of flats for older people, but has had to cut down on socialising because of the cost, leaving her feeling isolated. “We’ve had the pandemic, and hardly anyone ever came out their room. I didn’t see anybody for weeks because a lot of elderly people are still very anxious. And now this. I moved just as the pandemic struck. My old friends are starting to say they’d like to come, but that means going out, eating, going to something.” Suzanna has a teacher’s and a state pension, but says they have not risen enough over the last decade to keep up with her costs. “Even though I had two pensions, it wasn’t a vast amount of money,” she says. She is worried about inflation getting worse. “Even if you can manage at the moment, the anxiety of older people will be all about next winter, or when everything goes up more.” In the last three months, Ken Taylor, 72, a retired salesperson from Sherburn in Elmet, North Yorkshire, has begun keeping a list of everything he spends. “I’ve been budgeting for every penny,” he says. “I’ve got a section for the house, I’ve got a section for food, the car, food for the dog, so I can see where the money’s going. And it does go, just about all of it, every month.” His monthly income from a state pension and a small work pension is £1,188, and his outgoings for essentials are £1,096, leaving £92 for any additional expenses. “It will not be long before I do not have enough to last the month,” he says. “I dread to think where I’ll be in six months’ time, because by then I’ll be chipping away into my savings. Because of energy costs, which we know already are going to ramp up in October, and food costs, which are going up all the time – and of course fuel prices are another burden.” Taylor uses his car for his own mobility and to visit his children, and is also part of a voluntary group taking people to hospital, so there are people in the community who depend on his ability to keep it on the road. “Because we’re in a rural area, people can’t afford taxis to go to hospital, but we take them [for free],” he says. “I’d like to see more support, not just for pensioners, for families as well. I don’t agree with this thing about people just getting by. It’s not good enough. People should be having a good life. We’re a very rich country.” Janet, 66, a retired teacher, lives in rural Wales with her husband, John, 65, a retired civil servant. The couple are trying to make energy savings where they can. “We have switched off everything electric except the lights, fridge, freezer, washing machine and TV,” she says. “I’ve gone back to using an old oil-fired Aga that stood in the corner for years because it heats the house and it dries my washing.” The high price of heating oil is a major concern. The couple used to be able to fill their oil tank for £600, but it now costs them £535 to fill just to halfway. “The tank will be empty by next winter,” she says. John has had four heart attacks and is now suffering from the aftermath of a Covid infection, meaning the house needs to be kept warm. “We’ve closed off the upstairs of the house,” says Janet. “We’ve converted our sitting room into a bedroom. So we live downstairs. I’ve put a curtain over the top of the stairs, which is very thick. And we just don’t use the upstairs of the house.” Janet was one of millions of women affected by a rise in the state pension age. She retired at 60 with what she thought would be enough savings to see them through, but says they are now “absolutely stacked up with loans and credit cards”. Janet does now receive the state pension, but because of that she no longer qualifies for a carer’s allowance, which used to bring in £68 a week. “We’re working people,” she says. “We’ve worked all our lives and we’ve enjoyed doing it, because we felt we were doing a good job, a beneficial job. I just feel so abandoned by the state.” Adrienne Ayres, 69, retired from mental health social work in 2014. “I now have hardly any savings,” she says. “When you retire, the things [money coming in] can be very small. So I do things like selling clothes on eBay. Things like that pick up a few quid, but if you can have an extra tenner in your hand that stops you taking it out of the bank.” Ayres lives alone and says she is very anxious about rising costs. “I shop economically but the cost of living has risen way beyond my pension,” she says. “Food particularly. I used to be able to keep it down to £50 [a week]. But now if I’m not careful I get up to £80. So I’ve seen £30 [extra] going on a food bill very easily in the last few months.” She has also seen her monthly energy costs rise by £26 a month over the last year. “I’m barely cooking,” she says. “And yet it’s gone up that amount, so what is going to happen when the heating goes on?” Though Ayres owns her own home, she is worried about the future. “I’m a lot better off than many women my age but the coming decade, the 70s, is a challenge,” she says. “When I first trained as a social worker I saw elderly people living in abject poverty, I saw horrid care homes smelling of urine. I imagined that by the time I retired we would have improved how we cared for older people. That’s the measure of a civilised society, isn’t it?”",News/Business,‘I feel abandoned by the state’: UK pensioners on the cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/uk-pensioners-cost-of-living-crisis
5/19/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has opened up on Andreas Christensen withdrawing from Chelsea’s FA Cup final defeat by Liverpool on the morning of the game, claiming it was not the first time the defender had pulled out of a match at short notice. Christensen, who is set to join Barcelona this summer, forced Tuchel into a late rethink for the final when he made himself unavailable despite not being injured. The Denmark centre-back was in line to start but he has complained of stomach issues before games in the past and it is unclear whether he will be involved when Chelsea host Leicester on Thursday and Watford on Sunday. “Andreas came in the morning of the match to inform me, speak to me,” Tuchel said. “He told me he was not ready to play the match, to start the match and be on the bench. He had his reasons. They stay private and confidential. It was not the first time as you can see over the last weeks that we had some of the same situations. “That’s why he did not play regularly over the last weeks. We thought we are in a good progression, development because he played a strong match before the final against Leeds. The conversation took place. We had to respect it. Of course. He has our support still but for tomorrow I am unsure. It was very short notice before the Cup final, not only before this match. Other matches the weeks before. No chance I have a prediction before tomorrow or the weekend.” It remains to be seen whether Christensen is given a send-off at Stamford Bridge. The 26-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and agreed to join Barcelona after negotiations with Chelsea over a new deal broke down.",Sport/Football,‘Not the first time’: Tuchel on late Christensen pullout from Chelsea team,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/thomas-tuchel-late-andreas-christensen-withdrawal-chelsea-fa-cup-final-not-first-time
