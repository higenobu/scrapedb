4/5/2022,"The 17th-century Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo was so impressed with Jan Brueghel the Elder’s work that he once wrote to the artist, declaring he could smell spring itself in the minute petals and leaves that bloomed from the Flemish master’s brush. Four hundred years later, those with less olfactory imaginations can head to the Prado in Madrid to fill their nostrils with the scents that suffuse Brueghel’s 1617-18 painting The Sense of Smell. For its latest show, the museum has enlisted the services of curators, researchers – and the Puig perfume house – to recreate the fragrances of 10 of the many items that appear in Brueghel’s oil on board. The work, part of a set of pieces on the five senses, shows a beautiful garden where plants and flowers abound, peacocks amble and guinea pigs picnic. Brueghel provided the flora and fauna while Peter Paul Rubens contributed the allegorical figures. Inspired by its heady visuals, Alejandro Vergara, the Prado’s head of Flemish painting, had an idea last summer. “I was thinking out loud for a while and having different conversations with friends and colleagues about a year ago and we came up with the idea of focusing on the sense of smell and having a perfumer work on the painting, identify what’s in it, and create 10 scents,” said Vergara. Once researchers had identified the 80 different plant and flower species seen in the picture, Gregorio Sola, Puig’s senior perfumer, set about creating some of their scents. The fruits of his labour can be sampled from the four diffusers that sit in room 83 of the Prado, delivering their carefully calibrated perfumes at the touch of a screen. As well as jasmine, rose, spikenard, fig tree, orange blossom, daffodil, a bouquet of rose, jasmine and carnation, there is iris – and kid gloves scented with amber. While Sola opted not to conjure up the smell of the guinea pigs, the peacocks or the hound who has muzzled his way into the picture, he did recreate the scent of the civet who lies coiled in its bottom right-hand corner. Puig’s diffusers dispense a hot stinky hit of civet, which, thankfully, soon fades out. “Civet is a pretty harsh, dirty smell, but it’s what you find in all the [perfume] recipes from 1500 and 1600,” said the perfumer. “That’s because it was used as a fixative to make sure the perfume lasted on the skin.” The perfume is synthetic – “so no animals were hurt” – while all the others are based on highest-quality natural essences, including iris, which is twice as expensive as gold because of the long, slow and complicated extraction process. According to Vergara, the “strange, innovative exhibition” is intended to introduce visitors to the miniature world of Brueghel and to the scents of past centuries. “Brueghel is phenomenal, but many people don’t focus on him and the reason for that is that he paints very small scale, which makes it very hard when you walk through a museum,” said the curator. “And the Brueghel name is also a mess, people don’t know which Brueghel they’re looking at because you have Pieter Bruegel the Elder, his son Jan, and there are a bunch of other Brueghels – and that causes confusion.” But, added Vergara, The Sense of Smell is an incredibly beautiful painting achieved by using single-hair brushes and a magnifying glass. He hopes the unusual mix of sight and smell will pique visitors’ interest in the entire five sensory series. “I think it’s a really nice visit to a museum – in 45 minutes you look at five beautiful paintings and connect with this idea that you’re not expecting: the smell of the past.” Sola hopes his scents will help fix Brueghel’s picture in people’s minds as keenly as civet musk fixes a fragrance. “Our olfactory memory is stronger than our visual or auditory memory: the memory of our mother’s perfume, of our first kiss, of our first car, or of the first day at school with the smell of new pencils and paints,” he said. “We all have our own olfactory memory and the idea of this exhibition is that Jan Brueghel’s painting will leave its own memorable olfactory print on all of us.”",News/World news,Prado creates palette of odours to make scents of Brueghel painting,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/prado-creates-palette-odours-make-scents-brueghel-painting
4/5/2022,"Morrisons has warned its profits are likely to take a significant hit this year as the cost of living crisis and disruption due to the war in Ukraine weigh on the grocery market. The UK’s fourth largest supermarket chain said “developments in the geopolitical environment” and “ongoing and increasing inflationary pressure” since the beginning of February were hitting consumer sentiment and spending. It said it was difficult to predict how long the problems would last, and that unless conditions improved, it could face a “material adverse effect” on sales and earnings for the year. It had already seen a fall in earnings for the three months to 30 January compared with the same period in the previous year. In a statement issued before a meeting with investors who helped finance a £7bn takeover deal in October, Morrisons said underlying quarterly profits to January had plunged almost 10% to £316m. The statement highlights retailers’ struggle with soaring inflation on basics from milk and eggs to sunflower oil and wheat. Disruption to supply chains caused by the war in Ukraine has added to existing pressures resulting from a surge in consumer demand as pandemic restrictions have unwound in many countries. Rising energy prices – partly resulting from sanctions on Russia, which is a major oil and gas supplier, as well as increased labour costs in the UK linked to Brexit and the pandemic – are also adding to costs for businesses and fuelling inflation. Families have begun changing their grocery-buying habits as they look for ways to save money in the face of higher energy bills and petrol prices, with many switching to shopping at discounters. About a third of food and drink businesses reported that sales were below their expectations between December and February, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS also found that food and beverage producers were more likely to have incurred extra costs because of energy price rises and Brexit compared with other businesses. Morrisons appears to be one of the biggest losers from consumers trading down. In the latest data from industry analysts Kantar, the retailer’s sales fell 11.5% in the three months to 20 March, more than any other major chain. Aldi and Lidl, the German discount chains that typically do well when family budgets are under stress, were the only grocery retail chains to see sales increase as they drew bargain-hunting shoppers.",News/Business,Morrisons says profits likely to take big hit from inflation and Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/morrisons-supermarket-profits-sales-inflation-ukraine-war

4/5/2022,"Among all the outstanding actors who have appeared in the BBC’s television soap EastEnders over the years, none lasted longer, nor retained such huge popular affection, as June Brown, who has died aged 95. In the role of Dot Cotton, the chainsmoking, hypochondriac launderette manager of Albert Square, Brown created a great Dickensian character of detail, humanity and colour that enrolled her in the long-running soap’s female pantheon, alongside Barbara Windsor’s Peggy Mitchell, Wendy Richard’s Pauline Fowler, Anita Dobson’s Angie Watts and Pam St Clement’s Pat Butcher. She joined the cast in 1985, playing for eight successive years until 1993, when she took a break – and appeared in Rodney Ackland’s Absolute Hell, a vivid chronicle of bohemian low-life in London just after the second world war, at the National Theatre, alongside Judi Dench – before returning to the fray in 1997 and continuing for more than 20 years more, announcing in 2020 she had left the soap “for good”. As Dot, she gossiped for Britain, battled heroically with a wayward son, lost her job, helped her best friend to a comfortable death, married and lost a husband, Jim Branning (John Bardon), and maintained a running sparring match with Leonard Fenton’s kind GP, Doctor Legg. She often came out with the unexpected, and a nation hung on every word, inhaled every puff, as she gallivanted spikily among her neighbours. Only an actor of vast experience, in life and in show business, could possibly have played, and sustained, such a role, and Brown qualified gloriously on both counts. Apart from anything else, she produced six children in seven and a half years with her second husband, all of them in her fourth decade. “And here’s a funny thing,” she said, quoting Max Miller, “when I was in hospital, having given birth to my first child, I did my ballet exercises every day at the end of my bed. A week later, when I left the hospital, my waist had reduced to 24 inches; ironic, given how much I shunned exercise as a girl – and how little I do now!” When she appeared in Calendar Girls in the West End in 2009, aged 82, she claimed she was the only one of the replacement cast who stripped completely naked for the photo call. She simply could not care less about propriety or coy camouflage. She was one of those rare people in life, let alone the theatre, who simply said what she thought, did what she felt like and got away with it. Four years after Calendar Girls, in 2013, she bonded big-time with Lady Gaga on the Graham Norton television chat show, to such an extent that it was she who came across as the more outlandishly eccentric and hilarious of the two. Sipping from a large glass of red wine, she had the audience, and her fellow couch squatters, who included Jude Law, eating out of her hand for half an hour. June was born in Needham Market, Suffolk, the third of five children of Henry Brown, an entrepreneur in the expanding market of electrical gadgets and appliances, and his wife, Louisa (nee Butler). She was educated at St John’s Church of England school in Ipswich, and, as a scholarship girl, at Ipswich high school. After wartime evacuation to Leicester, she served in the Wrens in 1944-45, trained at the Old Vic School in London and joined the Old Vic company where, in the 1948-49 season, she appeared in Congreve’s The Way of the World, Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard and Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus, in a company that included Edith Evans, Faith Brook, Harry Andrews, Robert Eddison and Donald Sinden. She worked her way diligently round the reps, coming to a greater prominence in two seasons at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon (1955-57) and the Birmingham Rep where, in 1958, she played Hedda Gabler (“one of the most beautiful creatures I’ve seen on a stage” said the actor Nigel Hawthorne) and Lady Macbeth opposite the new star Albert Finney. Small roles on TV followed in the 1960s in both Dixon of Dock Green and Z Cars, though by now she was up to her elbows in children. Still, she managed appearances in The Rough and Ready Lot (1959) by Alun Owen, with Jack MacGowran and Ronald Harwood as soldiers of fortune at the Lyric, Hammersmith, and in John Vanbrugh’s Restoration classic The Provok’d Wife in a 1963 revival at the Vaudeville with Eileen Atkins and Dinsdale Landen. Appearing in many TV plays in the 60s,she also featured regularly in the Prospect touring company, based at the Arts in Cambridge, the launching pad of Ian McKellen, under the direction of Toby Robertson and Richard Cottrell. She maintained her “serious” connections at the Royal Court in two controversial plays: Life Price (1969) by Michael O’Neill and Jeremy Seabrook, directed by Peter Gill, a play about a child murder on a Midlands housing estate that emptied the theatre for 10 days then packed it out for two weeks when the doors were thrown open free of charge; and Just a Little Bit Less Than Normal (1976) by Nigel Baldwin, in which she played the mother of a young victim (Karl Johnson) of terrorist violence. In both, she represented an authentic voice of working-class anger. Although she played timid, maternal Mrs Parsons in three episodes of Coronation Street in 1970 and Lady Eleanor in the Time Warrior series of Doctor Who in 1973, it was EastEnders that changed her life and put her name in lights. Dot kept her busy but she did manage another couple of low-life spirits – Nannie Slagg in Gormenghast (2000), with Warren Mitchell, Celia Imrie and Christopher Lee, and a cleaning lady in Margery and Gladys (2003), a black comedy caper of a haughty widow (Penelope Keith) and her cleaner Gladys (Brown) taking off after mistakenly thinking they have killed a teenage burglar; they evade the police (Roger Lloyd Pack and Martin Freeman) and depart for the Caribbean after a night on the town in Blackpool. A Conservative voter, Brown was appointed MBE in 2008 and published a fruity autobiography, Before the Year Dot, in 2013. She was married to the actor John Garley from 1950 until he took his own life in 1957. She married the actor Robert Arnold in 1958. He died in 2003. Brown is survived by five children from her second marriage, Chloe, William, Naomi, Sophie and Louise. Another daughter, also Chloe, died as a baby.",Arts/Television & radio,June Brown obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/04/june-brown-obituary
4/5/2022,"Carrie Lam came to office pledging to unite Hong Kong, but she will leave accused of being a divisive leader of a politically turbulent city. Lam entered Hong Kong’s civil service in 1980, with her colleagues labelling her a “houdadak”, or “good fighter”, because of her strong will in a bureaucratic battle. She eventually rose through the ranks to become the first female governor of the key financial hub in 2017. She announced on Monday that she will not seek a second five-year term of office. Lam’s tenure has been marked by controversies and scandals. In 2019, as hundreds of thousands of protesters flocked to the streets to demonstrate against a proposed, then withdrawn, extradition treaty with mainland China, Lam warned activists not to push Hong Kong into an “abyss”. She told her people that summer she was not a “sell-out” or Beijing’s “puppet” in a tearful TV interview. The following year, Beijing imposed a hugely controversial national security law in the territory, which banned acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Since its implemantation, a succession of political activists have either been jailed or have fled the city. News outlets ranging from Apple Daily to Stand News have been forced to close. According to Reporters Without Borders, close to two dozen journalists and press freedom campaigners have been arrested since June 2020. More recently, the Lam administration’s insistence on “zero Covid”, in line with the mainland’s strategy, triggered warnings from international businesses groups of a potential exodus. Its handling of a deadly “fifth wave” of Omicron spread also led to the postponement of the election to find her replacement from March to May. Lam, 64, describes herself as a devout Roman Catholic. She was born into a working-class family of seven in the former British colony in 1957. She once called herself a workaholic, sleeping only three or four hours a day. In 1982, two years after joining the civil service, she was sent to Cambridge University in England for a course in development studies. It was there she met mathematician Lam Siu-por, who later became her husband in 1984. They have two sons; both were educated in Britain. Her ties to Britain, which is now accusing her of suppressing Hong Kong’s democracy movement, go back a long way, too. In 2004, she was the director-general of the Hong Kong economic and trade office in London, the city’s top representative to Britain. Lam returned to Hong Kong in 2006. The following year, she renounced her British nationality – she is likely to have been a joint Chinese-British citizen – and became the city’s secretary for development. Her husband and two sons, according to media reports, also held British passports. Lam’s rise to the top office came at a time when scepticism over Beijing’s influence in self-governing Hong Kong had begun to grow among some of its 7 million residents. She became the city’s No 2 in 2012, and in 2017 became leader, after securing 777 votes from a 1,194-member elections committee, which critics say is not representative of the will of Hong Kong’s voters. On 1 July, 2017 – the day of the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China – Lam was sworn in to office by Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. “Hong Kong, our home, is suffering from quite a serious divisiveness and has accumulated a lot of frustrations. My priority will be to heal the divide,” she said in her acceptance speech. Lam’s work has been consistently praised by Beijing, and her supporters say she has a difficult job in the first place. Her critics both inside the city and overseas say she failed in uniting a divided Hong Kong and plunged one of Asia’s most vibrant financial hubs into uncharted waters. “Her time in office has been characterised by numerous missteps that show just how removed she is from the population, and how little she cares about their concerns,” said Louisa Lim, author of a forthcoming book, Indelible City: Dispossession and Defiance in Hong Kong. “Time after time she has failed to stand up for Hong Kong’s interests or defend the city in any way.” Lam defended her government in an interview with the state-owned Global Times in December last year, but she also admitted the shortcomings. “What is most regretful is I was unable to unite Hong Kong society better,” she confessed. “Gradually, I believe Hong Kong society will be more united, and our citizens should be more confident for its future.” On Monday, she looked back at her five-year term saying: “I have faced unprecedented and enormous pressure.” She revealed that her decision was not a surprise to Beijing. In fact, she said, she expressed her intention to step down after her current term last year, and that Beijing was receptive. Analysts say the forthcoming election provided Lam with an ideal opportunity to leave office. In the autumn of 2019, she told a group of businesspeople in a closed-door meeting that she was “very, very limited” in what her administration could do. “For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable. If I have a choice, the first thing [I would do] is to quit, having made a deep apology,” Lam said, her voice breaking with emotion. “So I make a plea to you for your forgiveness.” But on Monday’s press conference, she insisted her decision was purely personal. “There’s only one consideration and that is family. I have told everyone before that family is my first priority in terms of my consideration,” she told reporters. “They think it’s time for me to go home.”",News/World news,Carrie Lam: a divisive leader in Hong Kong’s turbulent times,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/carrie-lam-a-divisive-leader-in-hong-kong-turbulent-times-profile
4/5/2022,"The Treasury has asked the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token, or NFT, as it attempts to show Britain is at the cutting edge for new technologies by launching its own cryptoasset. It said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had asked the 1,136-year-old institution to create the NFT – a type of unique digital asset stored on a blockchain, the same decentralised ledger of transactions used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin – so it could be issued by the summer. “This decision shows the forward-looking approach we are determined to take towards cryptoassets in the UK,” the Treasury said on Twitter, posting a picture of the royal coat of arms on a blue background. NFTs use the unique blockchain value to confer ownership of something – whether tangible or virtual – with pieces of digital art, photographs or music increasingly popular. Typically bought and sold by collectors, some NFTs have soared in value and are worth millions of pounds, as buyers use them to flaunt their taste or wealth, or speculate on the price gyrations to make money. The Treasury’s announcement did not specify what image or object the Royal Mint’s NFT would confer ownership of, whether more would be created, nor whether NFTs would be used to generate funds for the exchequer. A Treasury spokesman said more details would be announced “soon”. The decision to launch an NFT is likely to raise eyebrows at a time when more than a million people in Britain are expected to fall into poverty this year after Sunak did not do more in his spring statement to cushion the poorest in society from soaring living costs as inflation hits the highest level in three decades. The rise of NFTs has also led to a spate of scams and have become a target for hackers, losing consumers vast sums. Sunak said it was his ambition to make the UK a global hub for cryptoasset technology through close oversight of the emerging sector. “We want to see the businesses of tomorrow – and the jobs they create – here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long term.” The government said it intends to legislate to bring stablecoins – digital assets usually pegged to a fiat currency such as the pound or the dollar – into its regulatory regime, meaning issuers and services providers offering such products in the UK would need to follow rules set by UK authorities. Last month, Ukraine announced it would issue NFTs to help pay for its military after the Russian invasion of the country. The global NFT market reached $25.5bn (£19.4bn) last year, according to DappRadar, a firm that tracks sales, in a dramatic rise from $100m in 2020. As with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, some economists have said the craze bears the hallmarks of a speculative bubble despite its potential as a powerful and innovative new tool for artists, musicians and publishers.",News/Technology,Rishi Sunak asks Royal Mint to create NFT,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/04/rishi-sunak-asks-royal-mint-to-create-nft

Helen MacNamara, who now works for the Premier League, issued a statement after a leak naming her as one of the 20 people issued with fines after a Met investigation. She said: “I am sorry for the error of judgment I have shown. I have accepted and paid the fixed-penalty notice.” MacNamara was fined in connection with a leaving party held on 18 June 2020 to mark the departure of a private secretary, Hannah Young, who was moving to New York to take up a role with the British consulate general.

Boris Johnson was not present at the event but the former cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill and the former No 10 aide Dominic Cummings are reported to have been in attendance. Cummings has written a blog defending Young and saying: “It is deeply, deeply contemptible that not just the PM but senior civil servants have allowed such people to have their reputations attacked in order to protect the sociopathic narcissist squatting in the No 10 flat.” MacNamara left government in February 2021 and joined the Premier League the following May, where she holds the position of chief policy and corporate affairs officer.

4/5/2022,"About a year and a half ago, the artist Derek Fordjour picked up a copy of Black Herman’s Secrets Of Magic, Mystery and Legerdemain, a highly fictionalized memoir by the most esteemed Black magician of the early 20th century. “I’m not sure I believed his claims,” Fordjour tells the Guardian, recounting the magician’s improbable tales of traveling the world and outrunning bandits. Black Herman, he had concluded, was not really a good guy: “In my mind, he was a hustler” who convinced Black audiences during the Great Depression that they could cure all with his magic potions, and escape mortal peril by learning his tricks. Despite Black Herman’s grift, however, his success continued to fascinate Fordjour, who had never heard of any other Black magicians. Fordjour’s latest show, Magic, Mystery & Legerdemain, on view at David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles through 7 May, looks back at the history of magic as an elaborate cultural metaphor. “Magicians are people we give permission to deceive us publicly,” he says, unsurprised that in the public imagination, they’re nearly always white. Even pop culture’s current fascination with Elizabeth Holmes and Anna Sorokin – whose claims to fame are their respective abilities to make money appear out of thin air – “further demonstrate how privilege functions”, Fordjour adds, wondering aloud whether any grifter women of color had ever risen to such acclaim. “The more I thought about magic, the more I saw it as a really rich space to talk about privilege, power, deception and strategy.” In the spirit of Black Herman, Fordjour’s exhibition leans into high-key drama: visitors enter the gallery through a pair of opaque curtains, then proceed down a small tunnel lit by an ornate chandelier. If you come early, you’ll be greeted by a mysterious woman in showgirl drag, who later stars in the live magic show that takes place Tuesdays through Saturdays at 2pm. In a pointedly kitsch production co-written by Fordjour and the artist Numa Perrier, actor Nubia Bowe plays the assistant to Black Herman, who’s played by Kenrick “Ice” McDonald, magic historian and first Black president of the Society of American Magicians. In contrast to the magic show’s fully constructed vaudevillian stage, velvet curtains, tassels and all, Fordjour’s paintings and sculpture inhabit the more familiar space of the white cube gallery. Each work of art functions as a mini historical lesson, organized to play out in a kind of ballad. “There are chorus paintings and verse paintings,” Fordjour explains, where chorus paintings depict “actual magic, and specific magicians that lived”. Float, a painting of man in matching magenta turban and bowtie passing a hoop over a levitating woman, is of real-life husband-and-wife duo Goldfinger and Dove, who came up in Hollywood’s magic circles in the late 1960s. “I was interested in painting Goldfinger largely because of the headdress,” the artist says, alluding to the historical practice of Black magicians, barred from white stages, frequently playing the part of more “mystical” ethnicities. Where the chorus paintings represent “your more classically understood magicians”, Fordjour’s “verse” paintings present magic in a very different context. They portray figures like Fannie Davis, a stay-at-home mom who successfully ran an illegal gambling racket in Detroit in the 1960s. Her magic trick, according to Fordjour, was building generational wealth for her children during a period when Black families were routinely denied mortgages. There’s also a painting of Henry Box Brown, whose escape act from slavery involved mailing himself in a box to the free state of Pennsylvania. And Meu Povo, the largest painting in the show, depicts a carnival scene in modern-day Brazil that had felt so much to Ghanaian-American Fordjour like Africa. “These people were summoning a place that they had never been.” In both verse and chorus, the fractured surface of Fordjour’s paintings have the texture of peeling rust, or wet earth that hardens and cracks as it dries. It’s an effect he achieves in the studio by layering his canvas with tiles of corrugated cardboard wrapped in newspaper, painted, wrapped in more newspaper, and painted again. “There are 12 or 13 steps before I start a painting,” he explains, at which point he lays down his colorful imagery in acrylic, charcoal and oil pastel. Then, “there’s this life underneath that I can access by cutting away”. His digging an X-Acto knife into certain points on the surface creates moments of depth, and small explosions of color. During Fordjour’s daily magic shows, Black Herman and his assistant’s disappearing acts and switcheroos are punctuated by the magician’s operatic refrain. “But first you must believe!” McDonald belts intermittently, to the live, gospel-inflected organ music. “Magic is not real,” Fordjour insists, which is what makes Black Herman’s promises so egregious, but this show tacitly emphasizes the importance of believing anyway. The chorus and verse split magic into two different types, where the former is an untrustworthy game of spectacle, performativity and deceit. The latter, however, concerns the magic of human triumph – making something out of nothing, surviving impossible odds, or surpassing your own wildest dreams. This second kind rings loud and clear in Birth of Showtime, Fordjour’s most quintessentially LA painting. It’s a sentimental rendering of a young Magic Johnson reaching out to an orange tree with a visible sense of wonder, based on the basketball legend’s own story of arriving in LA for the first time. “He didn’t believe the oranges were real, so he asked his driver to pull over so he could actually touch one,” Fordjour recounts. “That moment for me felt very painterly, like the start of something.” What followed was the NBA’s transformation into a cultural institution so unprecedented that Earvin Johnson was no longer a fitting name; from then on, he was just known as Magic.

4/5/2022,"John Oliver discussed the many problems faced by truckers in the US and an industry that mistreats them. The Last Week Tonight host started by saying that “everybody loves” trucks, from kids to producers of reality shows, and they remain a “vital part of the economy”. He detailed that 70% of the tonnage that moves around the US travels via trucks. After just three days of no truckers, “every produce department would go from all you can eat market to all you can eat raccoon buffet”. But the industry is “facing a massive problem” with drivers. But despite headlines that might suggest the opposite, “it’s less a problem of driver shortage and more a problem of driver retention”. Driver turnover can be as high as 300% in certain companies over a year, with most about 100%. The base compensation is down 50%. One of the central problems is that “most drivers are paid by the mile not by the hour,” which doesn’t allow for the many hours spent loading and reloading. It’s become “a huge sticking point”, said Oliver, who showed footage of one driver who was stuck in his truck for 19 hours without pay. Many truckers are then forced to make up for time, which can be dangerous. About 5,000 people die each year in crashes with large trucks. The drivers are “squeezed between regulations and the companies that they drive for and at no point in the process are their own feelings or needs taken into account”. Another issue is that most companies classify them as independent contractors not employees, which means they receive no benefits and “all the costs and risks of truck ownership get pushed on to the truck driver” – which leads to “a pretty shitty bottom line”. Oliver also spoke about the fallacy of lease purchase agreements, where drivers are offered the chance to lease their truck from the company so they can eventually own it themselves. But they “almost never succeed”, Oliver reported, with one company saying just 5-10% of them were able to complete the purchase. That means truckers are tethered to one company and are paying back earnings. Companies often charge them for parking in their own lot and on one occasion, for using office toilet paper. This can lead to a driver owing the company money at the end of the work week. “Can you imagine picking up your paycheque and finding an envelope of $-5 bills?” he said. But some of these “predatory” companies are now finding themselves involved in lawsuits, including a $15m class action suit against Western Express. “We should probably recognise that we have all gotten used to the idea of next-day shipping, but someone somewhere pays the price,” he said.
