12/24/2021,"Energy bosses are dialling up the pressure on ministers to shield consumers from soaring gas and electricity bills, with calls on the government to set up a multibillion-pound scheme to help spread the cost to households over a number of years. Amid warnings that energy bills could rise by 50% next year, triggering a “national crisis”, suppliers such as EDF have called on the Treasury to follow other European countries by cutting VAT and green levies to bring down bills.  One idea gaining traction within the industry, including at the trade body Energy UK, involves a government-administered scheme to smooth the impact across multiple years so that consumers aren’t hit all at once. Under plans sketched out by energy suppliers, one or more commercial lenders – such as banks – would cover the immediate cost that they are incurring to buy energy on wholesale markets at record prices, with a sum of at least £7bn required. The loans would not require a government guarantee, but officials would be responsible for ensuring repayments. Fans of the plan believe this could avert the need to pass on the huge increase in gas prices with an immediate hike in the energy price cap that limits what suppliers can charge bill payers. The cap is forecast to rise from £1,277 to nearly £2,000 in April without intervention. With lenders shouldering the upfront cost of wholesale energy prices, suppliers would then be able to stagger tariff increases across multiple years, repaying the lenders through an industry-wide scheme overseen by the government. Ministers and officials are understood to be considering the proposal. One industry chief executive told the Guardian this would avoid extra spending or loan guarantees from the Treasury. “The mechanism could be funded by industry, the government would just need to make sure everyone paid back their part of it and that there were no free riders,” he said. “It just needs enforcement. We need to make sure we don’t slam households with all the costs in the single year.” Dan Alchin, the deputy director of retail at Energy UK, said the plan was among a number of options that could help ease the crisis. “Italy has stepped in and helped suppliers through loan facilities to spread increases out over longer periods of time,” he said. “We’re still working through how this could work in practice but that’s one way it could be facilitated. You don’t hit people with price increases all at once, you spread it out. “We need government to be thinking about these sorts of options and to take action to mitigate the worst impacts.” On Thursday the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy. But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the £600 expected rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up next year. Since 1 October, the cap – set by the industry regulator Ofgem – has been set at a record £1,277. It is due to change on 1 April when Ofgem is expected to raise it significantly, prompting predictions that the cap will hit £2,000 in 2022. One industry source said bills would be closer to £3,000 if energy suppliers were able to pass on the full cost of gas prices. “As it is, the price cap is hugely limiting the impact on households,” he said. “That’s a dam that will burst at some point. You can only hold the pressure for so long.” He said scrapping green levies and VAT “wouldn’t touch the sides” but that an industry-wide loan facility could have a larger impact. “We’ll still have to pay it but we’re not trying to pay off a one-in-30-year event in a single year.” EDF, the UK’s fourth biggest energy supplier, said the situation was “critical” and the government must “act now to support energy customers”. Philippe Commaret, the managing director for customers at EDF Energy, said that by next October the UK’s energy price cap “could easily exceed £2,000”. A government spokesperson said: “The energy price cap is insulating millions of customers from record increases in global gas prices and will remain in place, and at the same rate, this winter. We continue to support those most in need through our £500m household support fund, the warm home discount and winter fuel payments.”",News/Business,Ministers under pressure to protect consumers from energy price crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/ministers-under-pressure-to-protect-consumers-from-energy-price-crisis
12/24/2021,"The government has announced that the long-awaited Afghan citizens resettlement scheme will start in January 2022. The programme will provide support for up to 20,000 Afghans, prioritising women, children and others at risk.  The government says those who stood up for women’s rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law will also be prioritised under the scheme. It added that some of those already evacuated, including women’s rights activists, journalists and prosecutors, will be the first to be resettled under the scheme and will be granted indefinite leave to remain, which gives them the right to work and study. Those who worked for the British Council and the security firm Gardaworld, and alumni of the Chevening scholarship programme, will also be considered for resettlement. However, charities working with refugees have asked the government to provide more clarity about how the scheme will work. Louise Calvey, head of services and safeguarding at Refugee Action, said: “It’s vital for the thousands of Afghans stuck in hotels in the UK and the thousands more in fear of their lives in and around Afghanistan that the resettlement programme starts immediately and is properly funded. Yet ministers remain concerningly tight-lipped on crucial details, such as how many of the 20,000 people they’ve pledged to help are already in the UK, and how many additional refugees stuck overseas will be welcomed. “The government must also provide urgent clarity on how it intends to back local councils and international organisations to make sure people fleeing the Taliban quickly receive the life-saving protection and support they desperately need.” A British Red Cross spokesperson said: “We welcome the news that the UK government is set to open the resettlement programme that was promised to people within Afghanistan who need protection. “We know that resettlement programmes can be lifelines for people fleeing persecution and violence, especially when the right support is in place when they arrive in the UK. Our experience supporting a previous programme – for people from Syria – is that for these schemes to work well it has to be a real partnership between national and local government, charities like our own, but also the communities themselves, who play a vital role in welcoming those who seek safety here. “When that’s in place, the benefit [for] people affected by the crisis and the communities that welcome them is huge. We look forward to hearing more about the plan and how this will work in practice.”",News/UK news,UK will start resettling at-risk Afghans in January,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/uk-will-start-resettling-at-risk-afghans-in-january
12/24/2021,"Postal delivery deadlines have well and truly passed, and the window of time for a last-minute gift run has just about shut. Add rising Covid-19 cases to the mix, and a hasty trip to the mall on 24 December feels very much like panic buying.  While browsing for digital presents is something we “often don’t consider” because of “the tradition of having something physically wrapped up,” professor in consumer behaviour from Queensland University of Technology, Gary Mortimer, says the pool of virtual gifting options has dramatically deepened. “Being able to sit quietly one evening and go through a whole range of virtual gifts and experiences for loved ones certainly mitigates the stress of having to battle busy shopping centres,” he says. “I actually give a lot of virtual presents to my friends and family,” says Yulia Saf, blogger behind Miss Tourist, who spends much of her time travelling. “I do not think it ever feels like a last minute, ‘I-didn’t-have-time-to-buy-you-a-real-present’ present.” She says it is “really important” to consider what the person likes. Then it’s a matter of searching the web for “virtual gifts by interest”. Once you’ve found something that works, gifting it digitally is easy. There’s an app store pre-installed on most smartphones, and while most people use the store to download purchases on their own devices, you can also buy an app as a gift for someone else through them. Here’s how. On an Apple iOS device – like an iPhone or iPad – start by browsing the store for the app you’d like to gift. Once you’ve found what you want, tap the app to arrive at its detail page. There, you should see a rectangle with an arrow pointing up; that’s the action button. Tap it, and scroll through the pop-up menu until you see the “Gift App” option, then select it. From there, follow the directions to send the app as a gift, which will involve entering the contact details and a message for your recipient, setting a delivery date, and choosing a visual theme for your gift presentation. If you’re an Android user, Google Play doesn’t offer the same gifting service. But don’t worry, there is a workaround. In the Google Play Store app, tap on the Menu button. From there, select “Send gift”. Google Play allows you to gift credit for an app, rather than gifting an individual app alone. You’ll be able to enter the amount you would like to gift, and follow onscreen instructions to deliver that credit to your recipient. From Netflix to Spotify, Audible, and Amazon Prime, many online streaming services and subscriptions can be sent as gifts. For most, you can find a dedicated gifting page built into a streaming product’s website. But before you buy, Andrew Zeng, digital marketer and e-commerce expert, urges you to “read the fine print”. “Many platforms will only allow you to gift a subscription to new users,” he says. The Disney+ one-year gift subscription, for instance, cannot be added to a recipient’s existing subscription. Other services do “allow gifting additional months to pre-existing users”. Just be sure to double check the terms of the gift before you place your order. Mortimer also suggests perusing virtual travel experiences. “As a result of the pandemic, we saw a lot of travel agencies doing virtual tours of places,” he says. “Jordan, Petra, all the places you’d love to get to, but can’t.” Airbnb offers virtual experiences, from trip planning sessions to tours of famous movie sets; closer to home, Indigenous travel site Welcome to Country also has digital travel sessions on offer. Zeng’s personal favourite digital present is the gift of an online class. “A friend of mine gifted an online course subscription recently, around photography and branding, as I continue to grow my business,” he says. “I found it extremely thoughtful and endearing.” You aren’t limited to sending your gift to its recipient in a trite email with a link and activation code. Saf says there are plenty of ways to make giving the gift more fun. An easy option that will personalise the gift is a video. “Just record a simple, short video of yourself with a personal message,” Zeng suggests. “As if you were to give the gift in person.” Saf also says using video can be a helpful way to teach a not-so-tech-savvy recipient how to activate their virtual gift. She recommends using Loom video, which supports recording your screen and face simultaneously. For the camera-shy, Zeng suggests pairing your virtual gift with an e-card. Easy to find for free online, some e-card sites offer digital versions of classic printed cards, featuring quirky quotes and designs you’d pick up from the local news agency. Others offer animated video cards. Both are a ribbon on top of your virtual gift which you can upload into an email and shoot over to the recipient instantly. Finally, beyond the apps, subscriptions, vouchers and e-cards, Zeng recommends gifting custom digital art. “You could use a marketplace like Etsy, find an artist and have them hand draw a self-portrait, or something of significance,” he says. “It’s all about personalisation when it comes to virtual gifts, that makes it extra special.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘Certainly mitigates the stress’: how to give someone an app, subscription or other virtual gift",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/24/certainly-mitigates-the-stress-how-to-give-someone-an-app-subscription-or-other-virtual-gift
12/24/2021,"More than 35,000 British retailers and 20,000 bars and restaurants are facing significant financial distress, according to new data, while shoppers are forecast to spend almost a quarter less in physical stores this Boxing Day than before the pandemic. If fashion and footwear shops, furniture businesses and other “non-essential” retailers are allowed to remain open from 26 December, £3.94bn is expected to be spent in stores and online that day, 10% less than before the pandemic and 1% lower than last year.  Spending in physical stores alone is expected to fall by 23% compared with 2019 as many shoppers avoid high streets, shopping centres and retail parks amid fears over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. The forecast for the whole post-Christmas week is not much brighter, according to a report by GlobalData for Vouchercodes. A total of £13.9bn is expected to be spent between 25 and 31 December, down 9% on 2019 and up just 1% on 2020 when many high streets were in lockdown. Online retailers will be the big winners, with over £1bn expected to be spent on Christmas Day alone as shoppers snap up bargains while digesting their festive meals. Angus Drummond, a director at VoucherCodes, said fears of a lockdown had pushed shoppers to buy before Christmas rather than waiting for discounts, a trend that he said would “negatively impact the performance of Boxing Day sales”. Meanwhile, data released by the insolvency firm Begbies Traynor revealed the parlous financial position of 55,000 retailers, bars and restaurants across the UK amid reduced footfall and cancellations during a key trading period. The figure represents an improvement on the same quarter of 2020, but a 2% rise in retailers facing financial difficulty versus the period between July and September, as inflation and supply issues continue to bite. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “While many bars, restaurants and hotels have flourished since the summer as the UK has reopened … many now face the prospect of trading through what is typically the leanest part of the year with the double whammy of falling trade and very limited government support.” The disappointing sales for the post-Christmas week are likely to pile pressure on businesses that have suffered because of the pandemic and months of high street lockdowns. Cancelled holidays, parties, weddings and other events have also put a dampener on clothing sales, which account for a large chunk of the retail market. City centres appear to have been hit particularly hard by advice to work from home and nervousness about sharing public transport. Data from the retail intelligence firm Springboard on Wednesday showed a 17.3% drop in footfall in central London compared with the same day last week, and regional cities have recorded a 3.4% drop. Ailing finances could lead to a wave of business failures around the latest quarterly rent day, on Christmas Eve. Creditors often step in to secure their cash before the rental bill payouts at a time of the year when businesses are likely to be more flush with cash because of festive spending. Often administrators are not called in until the new year, however, as many leases have a “Santa clause”, which gives leeway on rent payment until after the Christmas holiday. Retailers have not been included in the government’s latest £1bn bailout package, which focused support on hospitality and leisure businesses. Hospitality businesses say that up to £6,000 in grants for each outlet is not enough to make up for lost takings.",News/Business,Dismal post-Christmas forecast for Omicron-hit high streets in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/post-christmas-forecast-omicron-covid-high-streets-uk
12/24/2021,"Stella McCartney took a near £2.7m salary from her fashion company last year, up more than £220,000 on the year before, while the business claimed almost £850,000 in support from the government’s furlough scheme. The designer’s pay went up despite a 26% fall in sales to £28.4m in the year to 31 December 2020, as sales in the UK more than halved, while the company recorded a pre-tax loss of £31.4m, according to accounts for Stella McCartney Limited filed at Companies House. The group made a £33.4m pretax loss the year before.  The accounts show McCartney’s label, in which she sold a minority stake to the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH in 2019, said it was dependent on additional funds being provided by its new shareholder in order to remain a going concern. LVMH, which owns a suite of high-end brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy, had already provided additional loans of £26.3m last year, taking its total lending to the group to just over £66m. Stella McCartney Limited said the directors of Anin Star Holding, LVMH’s investment vehicle, had “indicated their intention to continue to make available such funds are needed by the company” but there could be no certainty that support would continue. The London-based fashion company, which prides itself on its environmental and ethical credentials, said its aim for 2021 was to increase sales by 4% and “significantly reduce” losses. However, the business is likely to have continued to be affected by further high street lockdowns and limits on socialising imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic. LVMH bought into McCartney’s label in 2019 just over a year after she ended her 17-year business partnership with its rival conglomerate Kering, and bought back its 50% stake in her brand. McCartney, the daughter of the former Beatle Sir Paul and the late photographer and animal rights activist Linda, designed her first jacket as a teenager. After work experience at Christian Lacroix she rose to become the creative director of the Parisian fashion house Chloé, before starting her own label in a joint venture with Kering, the owner of Gucci, in 2001. A spokesperson for Stella McCartney Limited said: “During the lockdown senior management including Stella took a salary reduction. The 2020 accounts relate to a year of transition and the effects of the pandemic on the retail sector, yet given these challenges the brands sales have remained strong. “In common with all companies within our sector, we are currently dealing with one of the most challenging periods faced by a generation, and are conducting a review in order to adapt our business to the changing economics of our industry. “Our mission to end animal cruelty and to help embed sustainability as core principles in corporate conduct has delivered real progress. We are confident we can emerge stronger and better equipped to continue the vital work towards a more sustainable future for all.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Stella McCartney got pay rise while fashion firm took furlough cash,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/23/stella-mccartney-got-pay-rise-as-fashion-firm-took-furlough-cash
12/24/2021,"Spending time with family matters enormously to human beings. There was a spectacular reminder of that truth this week. DNA from the bones and teeth of 35 people who were buried more than 5,700 years ago in a neolithic tomb in the Cotswolds showed that, fully 700 years before work began on Stonehenge, 27 of the 35 were biological relatives from five generations, including small children. The realities of neolithic life are mostly unimaginable to us today. In their care for family, on the other hand, these otherwise distant communities seem vividly relatable. What was true in prehistory is also true now. This weekend will be its annual embodiment. For most people, the Christmas holiday is the pre-eminent family occasion of the year. Its religious significance has long been secondary to its social importance. For both good and ill, this is a family time. There will be many lonely and hungry people this weekend, and there is invariably a frightening spike in domestic violence. Yet, in spite of Covid curbs, the spread of Omicron and disruptions on road and rail, around half of Britain’s population still plans to visit relatives.  After the enforced isolation of Christmas 2020, this is no surprise. But, simultaneously, it is hardly a shock that greater caution than normal abounds in people’s shopping, socialising and travel behaviours. This year has been very different from the typical pre-pandemic Christmas, partly because so many staff in all parts of the economy have gone down with Omicron, but also because the combined effect of the past 20 months and the new variant’s high transmissibility means that the public is rightly cautious. The possibility of a renewed lockdown and a repetition of the last-minute disruption of 12 months ago has added to the collective restraint. The impact on some sectors of the economy has been devastating. It is a huge relief that Christmas is going ahead across the whole of Britain. Individuals need their break. So do families, communities and nations. The pressure on children has been damaging. The stress for elderly people is particularly palpable. Yet the holiday go-ahead has been a close-run thing. News that there will be no further announcements of new Covid rules in England was only confirmed by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, less than two days before the holiday. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have all been compelled to tweak and tighten their post-Christmas arrangements right up to the last moment. Future restrictions remain very possible. Any idea that all this is a political triumph for Boris Johnson is untrue. In the context of his past mishandling and rule-breaking, and the human losses that have flowed from his approach, the suggestion is immoral. Politically, Mr Johnson has been desperate for Christmas to go ahead, partly because he is a hedonist, partly to avoid a repetition of 2020, partly because it is a tabloid campaigning issue, but also because an intimidatingly large part of his party is recklessly opposed to any restrictions at all. Even Mr Johnson knows that the real issue here is whether, and to what extent, the economy and society can be kept going without the NHS buckling under the strain. Much of his party does not care. In this context, the possibility that the impact of Omicron on individuals may be less severe than feared is good news, if confirmed, but it is not a vindication of Mr Johnson’s handling of the pandemic. If a large section of the Tory party had had its libertarian way, Britain’s record infections, deaths and hospitalisation tallies would be larger still. It is great that the Christmas holiday is here, but the credit for that belongs to the good sense of the majority of the British public, not to the folly of their incompetent and divided government.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Christmas break: no thanks to Boris Johnson | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-christmas-break-no-thanks-to-boris-johnson
