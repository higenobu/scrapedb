3/11/2022,"Rivian (RIVN) reported its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results on Thursday after the closing bell. Shares fluctuated in after-hours and then fell as much as 9% immediately following the release. These are the results versus consensus estimates expected by Wall Street analysts for the electric vehicle startup's Q4 top and bottom line: Adjusted loss per share: —2.43 cents versus -2.05 expected Revenue: $54 million versus $63.99 million expected In its shareholder letter, Rivian stated: ""Through the first half of Q1 2022, we experienced several headwinds and other factors impacting our production ramp, including a planned 10-day shutdown to fine-tune our production lines, significant supply chain limitations, a large spike in COVID-19 cases likely attributable to the Omicron variant, and severe winter weather in Central Illinois."" ""Like the rest of the industry, we anticipate supply chain challenges to persist through 2022. We are working closely with our suppliers to identify component constraints early so that we can support the supplier ramp and/or develop alternative solutions if needed."" Rivian says as of March 8, it produced 1,410 vehicles in 2022 and 2,425 vehicles since the start of production. The Irvine, California–based company is pre-profitable and still in the process of ramping up its production. Rivian produced 1,015 vehicles and delivered 920 by the end of 2021. The EV startup's stock is down more than 55% year to date as investors have rotated out of tech and high growth names amid rising inflation the the likelihood of tighter monetary policy. Rivian shares also took a beating this year immediately following a couple of significant developments: The EV maker backed by Ford (F) and Amazon (AMZN) recently announced it would raise the price of its R1T and R1S electric pickup trucks due to inflationary pressures. The increase was initially supposed to apply to exiting and future orders. After heavy criticism from pre-order holders, CEO R.J. Scaringe apologized and promised Rivian would honor prices for orders already in place and for anyone who had canceled due to the hike. The price increase highlights the challenges facing auto makers amid rising costs for parts and raw materials. ""Everything from semiconductors to sheet metal to seats has become more expensive and with this we have seen average new vehicle pricing across the U.S. rise more than 30% since 2018,"" wrote Scaringe in a pricing update statement on March 3rd.  In early January the stock tumbled when Amazon announced it will be the first commercial customer for automaker Stellantis' Ram ProMaster Battery Electric Vehicle van launching in 2023. The e-commerce giant already has a deal with Rivian for 100,000 delivery vehicles to be delivered by 2030. ""The gut-check of having partner AMZN exercise its right to secure EDVs from alternative vendors (Stellantis, Daimler) has shaken investor confidence,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's auto analyst Adam Jones in a January note to investors. On Thursday, Rivian highlighted its partnership with Amazon. ""At the end of 2021, we sold the first production EDV to Amazon,"" said the shareholder letter. It went on to state, ""As we progress through these significant milestones, we are also in the process of exploring ways to further expand our commercial partnership with Amazon."" Rivian's stock shot up when it went public in November of last year. Shares are down significantly from its intraday high of $179.47. The company reached a valuation of about $152 billion in mid-November. Today, Rivian’s market cap is sitting of around $40 billion. Ines is a stock market reporter for Yahoo Finance.

3/11/2022,"Money can’t buy happiness directly, but it seems like paying a financial advisor sure can help. A new survey found people with more than $1.2 million in household assets report higher levels of happiness when working with a financial advisor compared to those who don’t have an advisor. The finding is part of Herbers & Company’s inaugural Consumer Financial Behaviors Study, which polled 1,000 consumers across the U.S. A financial advisor can help you manage assets and plan for retirement. Find a trusted advisor today. “As individuals move past $1.2 million of assets, those who work with financial advisors rapidly increase in happiness, while those without advisors rapidly become less happy,” wrote Sonya Lutter, the certified financial planner (CFP) and licensed therapist who authored the study. Herbers & Company is a consultancy firm that specializes in helping independent financial advisory firms grow their businesses. To quantify a respondent’s level of happiness, the survey presented each consumer with a list of 43 questions concerning his or her daily behaviors and interactions. The survey also pinpointed four core principles of happiness – fulfillment, intention, impact and gratefulness – and gauged how much respondents identify with each. All participants in the survey have at least $250,000 in household assets. The survey found that 66% of respondents who work with a financial advisor reported heightened levels of all four core factors of happiness. Only 34% of people without an advisor identified with those four principles in the same way. The results of the study also suggest that those with financial advisors experience greater satisfaction outside of their relationship with money. “People who have financial advisors are not only happier with their finances, but they are also far happier about their personal relationships and their communication with their partners,” wrote Lutter, a former administrator of applied human sciences at Kansas State University. “While it’s possible that happy couples might be more likely to hire financial advisors, it’s also possible that working with a financial advisor gives couples an opportunity to talk about financial goals, and thereby gives them a happiness boost.” Then again, the more money a person has, the happier they'll be, right? Not exactly. Respondents with $1.2 million in household assets reported the same level of happiness, whether they work with a financial advisor or not. Those above that threshold who work with an advisor reported significantly higher levels of happiness than those without advisors. The largest disparity in happiness was observed among the richest respondents to the survey. Of high-net worth individuals with $6 million or more in assets, those with a financial advisor reported the highest levels of happiness across the study. Meanwhile, those without a financial advisor reported the highest levels of unhappiness in the study, despite owning $6 million or more in assets. “For those who make it to the top 5% of wealth in the U.S., working with an advisor can mean the difference between being happy with financial success or allowing money to decrease happiness,” Lutter wrote. “It appears that a financial advisor is needed to increase happiness levels above the $1.2 million threshold.” The old axiom is true, money can’t buy happiness. Then again, a recent Herbers & Co. survey found that people with the most money are happiest when working with a financial advisor. However, those with over $6 million in household assets but no advisor reported the highest levels of unhappiness in the study. The survey shows happiness levels fluctuate among people with fewer household assets, regardless of working with an advisor or not. But once individuals surpass the $1.2 million mark, those who work with a financial advisor report much higher levels of happiness than those who go it alone. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors in your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now. When looking to hire a financial advisor, it’s important to do your due diligence and interview at least three possible candidates. Ask about their account minimums, fee structures, investing philosophies and any special certifications they hold, like the CFP designation. You’ll want to take all of these factors into account when choosing an advisor. If you want to take a closer look at an advisor and/or their firm, search for them on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database. This tool allows members of the public to access an advisor’s Form ADV, which contains important information about their business and displays any legal or regulatory disclosures on their record.
