4/8/2022,"This week I was shocked to discover myself on the front page of the Australian and other Murdoch-owned media where I was accused of being anti-Israel. This came as a huge surprise not just to me, but to my family, my neighbours and the many professional colleagues I have worked with as an editor and climate activist. It was a shock because, while I’ve been targeted for years for my climate change work, I have never been the target of a politically motivated hit job designed to undermine the independent candidates I support. It was also a shock to read that I am anti-Israel because I am not anti-Israel. I am not an anti-Israel activist. I am not an expert on Israel and don’t pretend to be. I leave that to those who do the hard work of making it their area of expertise. I have deep friendships and work closely with colleagues in the Jewish community in Australia, the US and around the world. Somehow, I am being used by Murdoch media to try to weaponise the issue of Israel, divide the Jewish community and turn them against sensible independent candidates. I am a human, not a tweet. But that is how the Australian decided to define me based on three retweets (retweets!) that I posted. Two of them were over 10 years ago. I retweeted about the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) campaign during this year’s Sydney festival because it was a campaign that cut through very quickly and was much discussed in the campaign world. I was not part of that campaign, nor did I call for people to boycott the festival. I went to a festival event myself. As a citizen exercising my right to free speech, my two other retweets were about specific human rights abuses. It’s something I feel strongly about not just in Israel but around the world. In the wake of this personal attack – and threats of more like it to come – what is not a shock to me is that it happened. Murdoch’s media and the Liberal party seem to specialise in intimidating and bullying those they oppose. It poses a real threat to fair elections in Australia. Sure, I was the headline, but it’s not about me. It’s about smearing by association the dynamic, independent, mostly female candidates l support and I believe offer Australia the best chance for positive change at the May election. I am simply a pawn to sacrifice in order for the Australian to defeat a powerful slate of independent candidates who believe in the integrity of government and want to change the toxic political culture in Canberra. I fervently support these candidates because they are championing sound policies for the public good. I don’t write their policies on anything – that’s their job – and from what I’ve seen, they are very good at it. We’ve seen what they can do. Their medivac, climate and integrity bills are just the kind of policy Australia needs. I support these candidates because it’s time to see what independents can do. What I am, to my great surprise, is a big enough threat to be front page news. It seems laughable and paranoid – that the Australian would pick on a lone volunteer for such scrutiny. The Liberal member for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, has taken to tweeting photos of me. But that does not mean it hurts any less. As anyone who knows me knows, I have worked hard for three decades as a climate activist, journalist and businesswoman. I volunteer in my community. I have a family. After watching the painful interview with Michael Towke on The Project this week, I can’t imagine what he and his family went through when the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and his team went to work on him. It is why I think it is so important to get the independents into power. And that is what this is all about. This week global climate scientists said we only have three years to begin to reduce emissions for a livable planet. The independent candidates I support want to do more than send their prayers as yet another round of deadly flooding hits Lismore and Sydney, or when the next devastating fires burn across Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. The independents want federal government action that meets the urgency of the crisis. It’s time to vote for elected officials who will address this threat, not hide from it. It’s time to vote for independent candidates who have put addressing climate at the top of their agendas. I ended up on the front page of the Australian because I dared to volunteer and to talk up these candidates and their priorities. As we head to the election in May, I ask my fellow Australians to focus on that, and not the Australian’s attack coverage. I’ll be there with you. And I’ll continue to speak out, to tweet and campaign for climate solutions and policy. See you at the polling booth.

4/8/2022,"Gomeroi traditional owners have voted overwhelmingly against entering into an agreement with Santos for its Narrabri gas project on the eve of a court hearing to decide if the project can go ahead without their consent. Santos has launched proceedings in the national native title tribunal to progress the 850-well coal seam gas project in north-west New South Wales without agreement from the Gomeroi People. The case will be heard over four days of hearings starting next week. The NSW and federal governments approved the Narrabri gas project in 2020. The lands targeted for gas production are subject to a native title claim, meaning Santos requires either an agreement with Gomeroi traditional owners or a determination by the national native title tribunal. Santos filed an application for a determination by the tribunal in May last year. It put an offer to Gomeroi traditional owners last month, seeking their consent for the project in exchange for a compensation package. The traditional owners voted 162 to two, with four abstentions, to reject the proposed deal. Raymond “Bubbly” Weatherall is one of 18 Gomeroi people who make up a representative body of the native title claimants. He said he did not think Santos had presented a fair agreement or negotiated in good faith. “Our land is worth more than money,” he said. “The spiritual and physical connection that we have to our country far outweighs any money any proponent can offer.” Weatherall said although the native title process did not allow for veto rights, the nearly unanimous vote was an indication of the level of opposition to the development. Traditional owners, community organisations and unions will hold a rally near the federal court in Sydney on Friday – the day hearings were originally due to commence in Brisbane – opposing the gas field. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gomeroi woman Suellyn Tighe said she was concerned about the effects the project would have on the environment of the Pilliga forest, water and cultural sites. “When it comes down to it, the destruction of the environment, cultural sites and spiritually important places will affect our cultural wellbeing,” she said. “Generations won’t be able to go see these places – particularly in the Pilliga – that are important for cultural practices.” A spokesperson for Santos said the company “has been engaging and working constructively with the Gomeroi community since 2012, and will continue to do so”. “Santos will respect the decision of the national native title tribunal,” they said. But Gomeroi man Boe Spearim said traditional owners wanted Santos to walk away and people were prepared to “continue to fight and do as much as possible to halt any destruction of country”. “Our goal would be that Santos get out of Gomeroi country,” he said.",News/Australia news,Gomeroi traditional owners vote against agreement with Santos for Narrabri gas project,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/gomeroi-traditional-owners-vote-against-agreement-with-santos-for-narrabri-gas-project
4/8/2022,"Rio Tinto has taken full control of an alumina refinery in which oligarchs Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg hold stakes after the Australian government slapped sanctions on the pair and banned the export of bauxite products to Russia. The oligarchs have an interest in Queensland Alumina Limited through shareholdings in En+ Group, a London-listed resources company which owns the second-largest aluminium producer in the world, Rusal. Rusal owns 20% of QAL and Rio Tinto owns the remainder. In a statement, Rio Tinto said: “As a result of the Australian government’s sanction measures, Rio Tinto has taken on 100% of the capacity and governance of Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) until further notice.” “Our focus remains on ensuring the continued safe operation of QAL, as a significant employer and contributor to the local Gladstone and Queensland economies,” the company said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement released last month, En+ said Deripaska “cannot receive any type of financial benefit from his minority holding in En+, Rusal or any part of the group and is completely blocked from receiving dividends” as the result of a 2019 deal with US authorities under which the companies were released from sanctions and the oligarch reduced his shareholding to 45%. “According to public sources, Mr Vekselberg is indirectly a minority beneficiary,” Rusal’s spokesperson said. “He does not have any influence on Rusal’s operations.” Activists who have poured pressure on Australian companies to sever ties with Russian oligarchs after the invasion of Ukraine welcomed the move. However, Dan Gocher, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said that “until Rio Tinto provides further details we remain concerned that Deripaska and Vekselberg may still financially benefit from Queensland Alumina”. “At Rio Tinto’s annual general meeting in London later today, the board is likely to face questioning from shareholders about its relationship with Rusal,” he said. He said Origin Energy, which is in a gas exploration joint venture in the Beetaloo basin with Falcon Oil & Gas, a company in which Vekselberg holds a stake, should follow Rio’s lead. “Origin is clearly attempting to weather the storm,” he said. “We have to ask what is the point of sanctions, if Vekselberg can still profit from any successful exploration in the Beetaloo Basin. “Origin Energy should suspend its joint venture with Falcon Oil & Gas until Viktor Vekselberg’s interest in Falcon is quarantined.” Origin has previously said it will “follow any rules dictated by the Australian government, and other governments as appropriate, with respect to sanctions”. “Origin is the majority owner and operator of the Beetaloo Joint Venture with significant operational control over any activities undertaken in the Beetaloo Basin. Origin is carrying 100% of the costs for current exploration activities, with no funding being provided by its joint venture partner.”",News/Australia news,Rio Tinto takes full control of Queensland alumina refinery after Russian oligarchs sanctioned,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/rio-tinto-takes-full-control-of-queensland-alumina-refinery-after-russian-oligarchs-sanctioned
4/8/2022,"It was an emotional sermon and Phil Dooley, the interim leader of the global evangelical megachurch Hillsong was preaching about pain. “Pain happens in life – sometimes we cause the pain,” he told Hillsong congregations around the world from its Hills Campus headquarters in western Sydney last Sunday. “In order to get healthy, sometimes we have to go through some pain.” Without directly referencing the recent troubles affecting the Pentecostal megachurch – which in the last two weeks alone include its founder Brian Houston resigning for breaching its code of conduct after two women said he had behaved inappropriately towards them, and the airing of an explosive documentary containing allegations about the church’s culture – Dooley also spoke about the need for “honest conversations” and added that “healing can only take place when we acknowledge this pain”. The pain Dooley speaks of has been felt around the world. A respected church elder and Houston family confidant has resigned, nine of its 16 American church campuses have broken from the church, including the resignation of its first African American pastor and leader of Hillsong Atlanta which opened less than 12 months ago. Sources say church attendance numbers, which have been rumoured to be in decline after several years of global scandals, have been noticeably down the last two Sundays. One production worker said camera crews were struggling to film the weekend’s sermons “without showing all of the empty seats”. Hillsong – which has grown from a congregation of 45 in western Sydney in 1983 to churches in 30 countries and on six continents – is in crisis. This week the Guardian has been made aware of rifts at the highest levels of the church that appear to run deeper than has previously been reported. This split led to the resignations of senior figures in Australia and the United States which began prior to Brian Houston resigning from all positions at the church on 23 March. Publicly, divisions have played out between what might be termed the spiritual and business factions of the church. The Guardian now understands there has been a split in senior management in the business wing of Hillsong about the direction of the church, including the moving to a future without the Houstons and other senior board members. There has also been significant debate within the highest levels of Hillsong about it operating as a brand rather than a church. Sources have stated they feel conflicted about airing this information publicly, but fear the church will not change without external pressure. Hillsong’s troubles came to a head several weeks ago with the resignation of Hillsong stalwart Dr Gordon Lee from the Australian-based church eldership, the body that looks after spiritual governance. Lee’s resignation is believed to be due to concerns with the handling of Brian Houston’s alleged “moral failings”. Houston resigned as global senior pastor after an internal investigation into complaints that he behaved inappropriately towards two women found that he had breached the church’s code of conduct. In a leaked transcript of an all-staff meeting on 18 March, Sydney-based Hillsong general manager George Aghajanian noted there were a lot of rumours circulating started by “a few of the elders” who he claims were not involved in internal investigations. “The elders’ role is to basically pray for people, and to care for people spiritually,” Aghajanian said. “But beyond that they have no government’s [sic] authority in our church.” It is unclear whether the eldership has been formally dismissed, but sources say that Aghajanian’s comments “reducing them down to nothing more than people who only prayed for the sick” means it has been effectively neutered. Aghajanian’s apparent attitude towards the elders has upset many staff and raised the ire of many in the “spiritual” faction of the church, and increasingly some within the “business” side of the church. Sources with knowledge of Hillsong’s power structure fear he could be using the crisis to consolidate his already considerable power. After several years of scandals in Hillsong churches culminating in the sacking of “celebrity preacher” and head pastor of Hillsong New York City Carl Lentz, the church hierarchy has been restructuring its governance. Local boards are being disbanded and put under the authority of the Australian-based global board, led by Aghajanian, who is described as the man behind the Houstons’ throne. He presides over the church’s business operations. The church has set up unpopular but widespread use of nondisclosure and non-compete agreements, routinely requiring workers and volunteers to sign NDAs, including Hillsong College students, who must sign an NDA each semester. While the church has said this is part of their “internal commitment to facilitate the protection of personal information” and necessary to comply with Australian privacy regulation, critics have long maintained it sets a culture of secrecy and fear, and forces people with complaints to take them in-house. Those complaints are often investigated by George Aghajanian’s wife, Margaret, the church’s head of pastoral care oversight. She is said to have a substantial role in interpersonal affairs and has investigated a number of incidents that have rocked the church in recent years. Former Hillsong College student Anna Crenshaw, who has alleged she was a victim of sexual assault by a fellow staffer and went through an investigation led by Aghajanian, described repeated questioning, accused the church of sitting on statements, and of a culture where she believes the church has “protected the perpetrator over the victim”. Last year, a Hillsong spokesperson told Vanity Fair Crenshaw’s complaint led to an internal investigation which “did take some time to complete as there were multiple parties present at the time of the alleged behaviour”. The perpetrator, Justin Mays, who was subsequently convicted of indecent assault, was “stood down” from his positions during the investigation. The power couple is cited by some Hillsong insiders and regular parishioners as the reason they declined to speak on record. The Guardian has contacted the Aghajanians for comment. One leader who is willing to speak publicly is Phoenix-based Pastor Terry Crist. A respected figure in the church beyond the United States, he withdrew his six churches from the Hillsong umbrella on 27 March. Over the weekend, he spoke to the Guardian and repeated his call for an overhaul of Hillsong governance. “I believe it is in the best interest of Hillsong Church globally to conduct an internal investigation related to board conduct, to immediately restore the Sydney eldership, to make the findings public, and to dismiss the board members who have protected the institution and not the people,” he said. Crist said his local parishioners are “very supportive” of his move to sever ties with Hillsong. “Our church has always felt the tension between our need to focus on local ministry versus the expectation to focus on the global initiatives,” he said. “I have heard from pastors all over the world this week expressing their concern for us and offering encouragement and prayers.” An expert in church governance has also warned that the resignation of Houston may not be enough, as leadership culture is rarely set by a single person. William Vanderbloemen is a church recruitment specialist who works with about 250 of the 400 largest churches in the United States. “In my experience, whenever there is a sudden or scandalous departure of a pastor and serious questions about the organisation’s culture, there is also a need for a more holistic review of the administration,” he said. “I’ve seen it so many times. Boards have to ask hard questions about who else should or shouldn’t step down. What about biological family or close friends involved in running the organisation?” Vanderbloemen said churches in crisis are also prone to overcorrection where new leaders are hamstrung by overcontrolling boards. “In a church like Hillsong where the founders are still the leader, a culture change is almost impossible without a leadership change,” he said. “Phil Dooley is a great leader and I hope he will be able to turn things around. But in my experience, I don’t know that you can do a cultural overhaul without having some level of personnel overhaul.” Many regular churchgoers agree the church needs to urgently change the upper echelons who have presided over several scandal-plagued years. Some have vowed to stay in the Hillsong “family” and fight to reform the church, but increasingly the pain of recent weeks is turning to outright anger. A 27-year-old member of Kingdom City, which was until recently Hillsong Kansas City, said she is pleased the church will be returning to focus on local issues and that the Houstons had shown a “drastic change in attitude”. Another member who has been attending Sydney’s Hills Campus for 22 years said she is staying on for now to fight for reforms, but “there is a group of us who have stated that if Brian returns or any Houston is appointed global senior pastor, we will leave”. One recently departed Australian church staffer doubts that Hillsong – which has built much of its popularity on highly produced music and stadium spectaculars – will ever be able to reign in its culture of “sex, drugs and rock’n’roll” and function as a church rather than a brand. “I’ve seen behind the curtain, I’ve seen the inner workings – and that’s why I’m no longer part of Hillsong,” she said.

4/8/2022,"The Coalition’s handling of the economy is central to Scott Morrison’s re-election pitch. In the last week Morrison has bolstered the government’s credentials with an impressive-sounding claim. “This global pandemic was 30 times worse economically than the global financial crisis of just over a decade ago,” he said in Kemps Creek on Wednesday. “But our employment outcomes have been 50% better.” The basis of the comparison about the size of the downturns is that, according to International Monetary Fund figures, world gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in 2009 and 3.1% in 2020. The basis of the employment claim is that for the 70 months of the 2007-13 Labor government, jobs increased by 916,000. Some 500,000 more jobs were created in the final 70 months of the Coalition government. Independent economist Saul Eslake told Guardian Australia the claim was “a little misleading, but not entirely wrong”. The government has used figures adjusted for purchasing power parity, which Eslake said attempts to correct for the value of services being “underpriced” in developing economies. But at market exchange rates, without making adjustments for reported value, Eslake said global GDP fell by 2% in 2009 and 3.5% in 2020. Suddenly the downturn that is “30 times bigger” is less than twice as big. Stephen Koukoulas, the managing director of Market Economics and a former economic adviser to Julia Gillard, said the claim is “absurd”. “It’s using a very, very small numerator to work out a big change,” he said. But Eslake said there is “some basis for Morrison’s claim”. “And the reason is the global financial crisis was really a north Atlantic financial crisis, of North America and western Europe.” Eslake said other countries, including Australia, “avoided the most severe consequences”. “[The Covid downturn] was truly global, it had an impact on large developing countries China, India, Brazil and Indonesia that were relatively unaffected by GFC.” Eslake said that advanced economies’ GDP fell by 3.3% in 2009, compared with 4.5% in 2020. “From that point of view, the Covid recession was half as big again for advanced economies, of which we are one,” he said. Looking just at Australia, the biggest contraction in the GFC was the December 2008 quarter (-0.5%) compared with the first half of 2020 (-7%). “So you could say perhaps for Australia it was 14 times,” Eslake said. Eslake said the Covid recession was the “the direct result of government policies to shut economies down, for which there was almost no precedent”. “In contrast most other recessions are caused by interest rates being too high for too long … or a financial crisis, or both,” he said. “Partly because it was caused deliberately by governments, [they] felt a moral responsibility to ameliorate the consequences of that recession to a much greater extent than they have in the past. The amount of fiscal stimulus was enormous.” G20 countries injected fiscal stimulus worth more than 5% of GDP in 2020, compared with 2.4% in 2009. “The fiscal policy response of advanced economy members of G20 was more than double what was done in GFC and that was true in Australia,” Eslake said. On employment, Eslake noted there is “all sorts of scope for cutting it in the way you want”. “Employment didn’t fall very much during GFC so the recovery, almost by definition, wouldn’t be that strong.” Morrison’s claim is good as far as it goes, but how far is that? Not very. Yes, the Covid recession was larger than the global financial crisis. By most measures, it was not “30 times” as large, although the measure he has used is technically accurate. The two downturns differ in that governments could fix most of the economic harm caused by Covid by lifting restrictions once the virus had been eliminated in a state or after the population was vaccinated.
