4/5/2022,"The desolate stillness of a photograph showing a row of barracks belies the turbulent conditions of its making. Two months after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, executive order 9066 authorized the forced removal and mass incarceration of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans living on the west coast by the United States government. Cameras were considered contraband and banned from the camps, but Toyo Miyatake, a respected photographer before the outbreak of war, managed to assemble a makeshift one from a lens and film holder he had smuggled inside the Manzanar camp in California. For months he took photos like this one clandestinely, compelled to capture for posterity the realities there; eventually the camp director allowed Miyatake to become the camp’s official photographer on the condition that a white assistant would click the shutter, thereby remaining technically within the rules. Photography has long been used as a means to document, but as Miyatake’s work attests, it can also be used to resist. A new exhibition at the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum in Queens, No Monument: In the Wake of the Japanese American Incarceration, considers how Japanese American artists have represented and remembered the incarceration through experimentation with photography and sculpture. Sculpture, after all, is the traditional medium of monuments, and the presentation marks the 80th anniversary of the signing of executive order 9066 in February 1942 while conveying ambivalence toward the commemoration and memorialization of historical trauma, particularly at a time when monuments of racists and colonizers are being removed. “Monuments tend to be erected at the expense of the peoples whose forgotten life and labor make their construction possible,” points out Genji Amino, who curated the show with Christina Hiromi Hobbs. “Instead of aspiring to elevate overlooked events and degraded life to the status of authoritative history, what would it mean to look to experiments by artists of color in order to imagine alternatives to monumentalism?” Artworks by celebrated modernist sculptors like Isamu Noguchi and Ruth Asawa are displayed alongside a small selection of crafts made by as-yet-unidentified Japanese Americans in the concentration camps, with instances of art making in the periods before, during, and immediately after the second world war sharing space with more recent efforts to contend with the legacy of the harrowing events that signified the apex of anti-Japanese sentiment in the 20th century. No Monument interrogates common framings and official histories of Japanese American incarceration. “Our exhibition aims to move beyond narratives of resilience and sacrifice, which, despite the truths they contain about wartime Japanese American experience, can often have the effect of calling attention away from the racial violence perpetrated by the state during this period, of romanticizing Japanese American suffering, and of failing to address the fact that the legacy of the incarceration has not been outlived and the structures that produced it are still intact,” Amino says. White photographers like Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams played a role in those narratives, creating widely circulated photos that some criticize as showing Japanese Americans as loyal, hapless victims, exemplary citizens and assimilable into society – all precursors to the model-minority myth of hard-working, rule-following Asian Americans triumphing over adversity. “Many members of the broader American public are unaware that the Japanese American incarceration even happened, or if they are aware of it, they might believe that the incarceration wasn’t so bad,” Hobbs says. “Japanese Americans were allowed to make art and play baseball, and therefore the experience is not comparable to other atrocities.” But its impact was felt far and wide, which the exhibition proves with works by not only west coast artists who were incarcerated following the executive order but also those living in Hawaii under martial law after Pearl Harbor and those on the east coast who lived under threat but not confinement. “No Monument suggests that the wound of the incarceration extends beyond those who were immediately affected to also include those living in other parts of the United States at the time, as well as to the descendants of those who were incarcerated,” Hobbs explains. And the incarceration was no discrete event but rather one that reverberated long after and even before the war: the show includes some striking, expressive prewar photographs by west coast Japanese American pictorialists, an influential movement extinguished by the incarceration whose lost and destroyed works are only now beginning to be appreciated. Some artists turned to abstraction to process what many found unthinkable (and was later euphemized by official histories as internment). Evoking the enclosing and revealing of memories are a see-through polyester-resin sculpture by Leo Amino (the curator’s grandfather) and Noguchi’s eviscerated Monument to Heroes, riddled with bones and wooden blades. (As a New York resident, Noguchi was exempt from the government’s evacuation orders, but in 1942 the already-established artist willingly – and controversially – entered Arizona’s Poston camp, where he spent futile six months attempting to improve conditions and develop an arts program.) The legacy of imprisonment endures, even if 80 years on few physical structures remain. From 1993 to 1995 Patrick Nagatani, a descendant of incarcerated Japanese Americans, photographed the 10 major concentration-camp sites, finding building remnants and detritus at some, while others bore no trace of that history; what can and cannot be seen is one of the exhibition’s themes. “It’s that seamless surface, the wounds that can’t be seen, which again connects to the model-minority idea,” Amino says, gesturing to a giant peanut-like closed-form ceramic by Hawaiian-born Toshiko Takaezu that nowhere betrays that it contains a rattle. “I hope that in the exhibition descendants are able to reflect on the possibility of silence as a form of memory and inscrutability as a form of remembrance,” adds Hobbs. In conversation with these works of fine art are crafts made by Japanese Americans in the camps, including carved-wood nameplates that differentiated the barracks. But the discourse surrounding these objects has at times been problematic. “The way they have been celebrated is often synonymous with the celebration of Japanese American sacrifice, industry, and even grace in the face of adversity,” Amino explains. “The title of the first publication documenting the incarceration arts, Beauty Behind Barbed Wire, says it all, celebrating the Japanese American capacity to transform circumstances of degradation and deprivation into art.” These objects are now housed at Los Angeles’s Japanese American National Museum and circulate as part of the traveling exhibition and remembrance project Contested Histories: Art and Artifacts from the Allen Hendershott Eaton Collection, which arrives at the Noguchi Museum this weekend in conjunction with No Monument and continues to crowdsource information about the objects. Looming as a centerpiece is Kay Sekimachi’s ethereal 1969 nylon monofilament sculpture Ogawa II, an apt alt-monument that floats from the ceiling and appealed to the curators for its interiority, transparency, and haunting quality. Citing this work, Hobbs hopes the show furnishes a space for Japanese Americans to grieve and reflect: “For members of the community whose ancestors found the experience of the incarceration to be too difficult to name, I hope that spending time with the works in the exhibition might provide some solace.” It may not be made of stone or stand staunch on a base like typical monuments, but the force of its presence is just as undeniable.

4/5/2022,"Pro-green cabinet ministers are frustrated by Boris Johnson’s decision to back away from ambitious onshore windfarm plans for England, as it emerged more than 100 Tory MPs are lobbying against the policy behind the scenes. The prime minister, who is to announce his energy strategy later in the week, will announce big targets for increasing nuclear power and offshore wind, as well as exploiting more North Sea oil and gas. But he has been hit by a cabinet split over onshore wind, with Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, and Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, in favour, and others including Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, branding onshore turbines “an eyesore”. Another nine ministers sitting in cabinet – Steve Barclay, Nadine Dorries, Simon Hart, Chris Heaton-Harris, Brandon Lewis, Priti Patel, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Mark Spencer and Nadhim Zahawi – signed a letter calling for a cut in support for onshore wind in 2012. The letter was orchestrated by Heaton-Harris, now responsible for party discipline, who co-ran a campaign called Together Against Wind and wrote a manual that was a “step by step guide on opposing a windfarm in your area”. A spokesperson for Heaton-Harris would not comment on his communications with the prime minister about the issue of onshore wind. One cabinet source said those cabinet ministers and Tory MPs arguing against the expansion in England said they “should look at the polling in favour of onshore wind. They are fighting a war from 10 years ago.” The prime minister is expected to approve financial incentives to encourage communities to accept windfarms in exchange for lower energy bills, but changes to planning laws in England to make permission easier to get are less likely. One government source said: “If you strip away the theatrics, everybody is talking about community consent. The PM has spoken about that, Kwasi has spoken about that. That’s one thing ministers would want to ensure that communities are to be paid to directly share in community infrastructure close by.” He added: “The workhorse of Britain’s future energy needs is and will be offshore wind. There will be more onshore wind and it will be in windy parts of Scotland. Let’s see what happens in England.” John Hayes, the Tory MP and former energy minister who led the charge against onshore wind in 2015, warned the government against overturning the moratorium put in place at that point. “To reverse that would be extremely politically unwise but also the argument does not stand up in terms of environmental efficiency and energy efficiency,” he said, arguing against an expansion of onshore wind on the grounds of cost, protecting wildlife, and aesthetics. One Tory MP said there was a WhatsApp group of more than 140 anti-onshore wind Conservative MPs, who would make it very hard for any energy bill with stretching onshore wind targets to pass. “It’s certainly way more than his [Johnson’s] majority,” he said. Another Conservative MP put the number of rebels at more than 100, adding that the prime minister was not politically strong enough to get such proposals through his own party. But Chris Skidmore, a Tory MP who runs the net zero support group, said: “We are at a fork in the road here. We either need to double down as Kwasi is doing and saying we need secure forms of homegrown clean energy. You could say look at the North Sea – but it’s gone. We’ve extracted most of it. Fracking – we’re not the States. So what you need is the tripartite plan of wind, nuclear and energy efficiency. There is public support for onshore that there wasn’t 10 years ago.” Renewable industry sources were not downcast about the government’s plans. “[Johnson] needs to get energy bills down quickly, he’s not going to rule out onshore wind and solar. It’s a case of how you go about doing that in a way that gets it past the nimbys. He was interested in local electricity discount schemes, where the closer you live, the more you get off your bill,” the source said. It comes as energy scientists criticised Shapp’s comments, in which he claimed onshore wind would be an “eyesore” and destroy the view in beautiful areas. Dr David Toke, from the University of Aberdeen, said this is false, and that there is plenty of land, for example next to train lines, that is ripe for use. He told the Guardian: “Only a small proportion of England is classified as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Yet, for, example, there’s very few wind turbines near to motorway routes, which can hardly be classed as beautiful. As you go from England to Scotland by road or rail you will notice a definite increase in the use of land close to transport corridors for windfarms. “The rules effectively banning windfarms in England are unique to planning in the UK and are a testament to the government’s political inability to mobilise this very cheap and clean source of renewable energy to reduce our energy bills.”",News/Environment,Boris Johnson blows cold on onshore wind faced with 100-plus rebel MPs,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/boris-johnson-blows-cold-on-onshore-wind-faced-with-100-plus-rebel-mps
4/5/2022,"Civil service chiefs are braced for the behaviour of top Whitehall officials to be severely criticised in the Sue Gray partygate report, after the government’s former ethics chief apologised for attending an illegal gathering. Amid speculation about whether Boris Johnson will be fined over lockdown parties in No 10, there is also consternation in Whitehall about how to deal with the fallout from senior civil servants being implicated as organisers of gatherings when the full report is finally published. It comes as Helen MacNamara, the former head of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office, issued an apology after a leak named her as one of the 20 people issued with fines after a Metropolitan police investigation. A senior source said there was concern that details in the report by Gray, herself a senior civil servant, would cast some civil servants in a bad light and there may be evidence that some knowingly broke rules when organising gatherings, leading to the potential for disciplinary action. Gray has the power to name senior civil servants in her report although she may choose not to use it. In her interim report, she named no names and referred only to the “senior official whose principal function is the direct support of the prime minister” – thought to be an allusion to Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary. The government has committed to revealing whether or not Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, receives a fixed-penalty notice but intends to keep other names secret. Gray will not know who has received a fine when she publishes her report after the conclusion of Scotland Yard’s inquiries. Downing Street on Monday defended the “anonymous process” of the Met investigation, under which names of those being fined are not officially released. Some Tory MPs are increasingly unhappy about the “drip-drip” of revelations, however, with backbencher Steve Brine saying: “I would have thought that the best thing is just transparency, open the curtains.” The Met is expected to issue a further wave of fines in the next few weeks, with Gray publishing her full report as soon after that as possible, potentially after local elections purdah is over in May. Despite the investigation, cabinet ministers attempted to draw a line under the partygate scandal on Monday. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit minister, said fines for the parties were “not the most important issue in the world” given atrocities in Ukraine while Simon Hart, the Welsh secretary, insisted the “world has moved on”.",News/Politics,‘Partygate’: Whitehall braced for top staff to be implicated in Sue Gray report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/partygate-whitehall-braced-for-top-staff-to-be-implicated-in-sue-gray-report
4/5/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of cancer patients in England face being diagnosed late in the coming years, MPs have warned, as they condemned the government’s failure to tackle the NHS staffing shortages that risk survival rates going into reverse. In a 52-page report on cancer services, the Commons health and social care committee said the absence of any serious attempt by ministers to fill gaps in the cancer workforce was jeopardising efforts to improve survival rates. MPs added that without action 340,000 patients between 2019 and 2028 will be denied an early diagnosis, which could mean the difference between life and death. The verdict came after an inquiry by MPs found there was no detailed plan to address shortages of clinical oncologists, consultant pathologists, radiologists and specialist cancer nurses. “Earlier cancer diagnosis is the key to improving overall survival rates. However, progress is being jeopardised by staff shortages which threaten both diagnosis and treatment,” said Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the committee, who said the Covid crisis had exacerbated the problems in cancer care. “We are further concerned at the damaging and prolonged impact of the pandemic on cancer services, with a real risk that gains made in cancer survival will go into reverse. “A mother told us of her 27-year-old daughter’s five-month struggle to get a diagnosis of cancer – tragically she died three weeks after it came. Unfortunately, many more lives will almost certainly end prematurely without earlier diagnosis and prompt treatment. “That is why we are calling on the government and the NHS to act now to address gaps in the cancer workforce upon which success depends. To date we have found little evidence of a serious effort to do so.” Despite claims the NHS protected cancer services during the pandemic, 3 million fewer people in the UK were invited for cancer screening between March and September 2020, MPs discovered. Between March 2020 and March 2021, 326,000 fewer people in England received an urgent referral for suspected cancer. About 4.6m fewer key diagnostic tests were carried out, the report added. Witnesses told MPs that they had been forced to “ration treatment”, and likened working in cancer services during the pandemic to “working 25 years ago”. MPs also highlighted that because of pressure on GPs, family doctors may not spot as many potential cancer cases. They said that urgent cancer referrals have begun to recover but waiting time targets are being missed, which risks “greater numbers of late diagnoses”. The MPs said the best way to improve survival rates would be to diagnose more cancers at an earlier stage, but achieving ambitions to improve early detection rates would be difficult without sufficient staffing. “Neither earlier diagnosis nor additional prompt cancer treatment will be possible without addressing gaps in the cancer workforce and we found little evidence of a serious effort to do this,” the MPs said. “This report sounds the alarm to government, loud and clear, about the severe staff shortages within the NHS and sheer lack of realistic targets in place to fill the gaps,” said Minesh Patel, the head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support. “This is causing huge anxiety for people living with cancer.” Dr Ian Walker, the executive director of policy, information and communications for Cancer Research UK, said the report exposed the government’s “persistent failure” to address chronic staff shortages. The co-founder of the #CatchUpWithCancer campaign, Professor Pat Price, warned that unless urgent action was taken to address the shortages, “this will translate into more people dying younger and unnecessarily”, adding: “This is a crisis that should be at the top of the prime minister’s priority list”. NHS England said cancer had been a priority for the NHS “throughout the pandemic”. It added: “We have been seeing referrals for cancer checks at record highs for the last 11 months – with more than 567,000 people starting cancer treatment since the start of the pandemic – and by investing £3.8bn in increased treatment and diagnostic capacity through the elective recovery plan we aim to ensure that we are catching and treating more cancers at an early stage and saving even more lives.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the government will invest £8bn over the next three years to cut the backlog and deliver an extra 9m checks, scans and operations by 2025, as well as up to 160 community diagnostic centres.",News/Society,"340,000 cancer patients face late diagnosis due to NHS staff shortages",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/05/340000-cancer-patients-face-late-diagnosis-due-to-nhs-staff-shortages
4/5/2022,"Who is to blame? In the hailstorm of bad NHS news, the government and its press outriders are trying, with some success, to shift guilt on to the NHS itself. The public is no longer clapping, they say, with only 36% of voters telling the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey that they are satisfied with the NHS. That figure should frighten any government – unless people are persuaded to blame the NHS instead of its political masters. Look at the groundswell of rightwing commentary blaming “lazy” GPs and “overpaid bureaucrats”, with articles headlined “The public have lost faith in our NHS religion” (Daily Telegraph) and “Are we falling out of love with the NHS?” (Spectator). Will this strategy of shifting the blame work? Probably not. The last time public approval fell so low was in 1997, when Tony Blair’s “24 hours to save the NHS” helped turf out a Tory government after years of underfunding. In the BSA survey, the three top reasons for dissatisfaction given were long waits, NHS staff shortages and inadequate government funding – not the treatment itself. No miracle can save the Tories from facing the next election with the NHS in a crisis which they have created: waiting lists and staff vacancies will still be rising. Anita Charlesworth, research director at the Health Foundation, warns that a million more health and care staff will be needed when this decade of ageing reaches its peak. Trawling the world for staff can’t fill the void caused when the Tories’ 2010 budget axed training places for clinicians who would now be in service. On Tuesday the Lords will again vote on former health secretary Jeremy Hunt’s amendment demanding regular estimates of NHS staffing needs for the next five, 10 and 20 years. Former Tory health minister Julia Cumberlege, championing the amendment in the Lords, tells me that saving the £6.2bn a year wasted on agency staff would pay for the extra trainees. You can see why the Treasury blocks any revelation that a million more NHS staff will be needed. The present struggle is to retain staff whose pay was cut by an average of £850 last year. The Tories may be comforted by 39% of the survey sample saying the NHS wastes money and 25% saying the NHS “must live within its means”. Yet there is rock-solid support for its founding principles – free for everyone (94%) and paid from taxes (86%). Few on the Tory benches harbour Hayekian hopes of dislodging Aneurin Bevan’s socialist system: they know it would be political suicide, and most know that private insurance dreams are unworkable nonsense. The political algorithm is simple: fund the NHS well and satisfaction rises. Though funding is nominally back to historical growth, inflation saps it, with no chance of repairing a decade of its lowest funding growth ever, says Charlesworth. Ministers mock the “magic money tree”, but they offer their own “magic efficiency tree”, she says, as they double impossible “efficiency savings” to 2.2% which the NHS must squeeze out this year. Ministers can blame Covid, but the NHS was already plagued with a 4.4m waiting list. There are fewer doctors, nurses, beds and intensive care places than in comparable countries. Their best hope is to blame those who are struggling to provide underfunded services, by putting themselves “on the side of consumers” against NHS professionals. Of course NHS staff aren’t all saints, and there are obstructive professional demarcations, but unpopular politicians attack respected public servants at their peril. The NHS will never lack disasters, or even the sort of heart-rending callous treatment revealed in the Ockenden report, on deaths caused by poor maternity care in Shrewsbury and Telford, which was valiantly exposed by determined victims. “Never again” gets repeated every time, but Alastair McLellan, editor of Health Service Journal (HSJ), says that for all the “lessons learned” he doubts there will be a time when disasters never happen. Each has its own local causes – on this occasion, midwifery dogmatism on “natural” birth, arrogant doctors and managers who engaged in obfuscation. But as health secretary Sajid Javid vows to “go after” those responsible, he should note the report’s emphasis on lack of funds and staff. Avoidable deaths are embedded in Javid’s own regular statistics, with funding at their root: when 6.1m patients languish on English lists, people die waiting. The HSJ tracks collapsing ambulance services, with 3,000 people suffering “severe harm” in February alone because of delays in reaching those with strokes and heart attacks. Average response times stand at a shocking 78 minutes, due to hour-plus handover times at hospital entrances. McLellan says the cause is “lack of social care filling the beds, preventing admissions, delaying ambulance handovers”. He expects coroner’s courts soon to record large numbers of deaths due to late ambulances. Last week the government ended Covid restrictions and free tests in England, though infections have hit their highest ever level, and the Office for National Statistics says that 1.5m people are reporting long Covid, which will have unknown consequences for the NHS. The Guardian has revealed how children’s mental services have been overwhelmed, a situation worsened by Covid. But for all the NHS’s troubles, hold on to this: in the national patient survey in late 2021, most people report that they had good treatment, with 75% approval for hospitals, 83% for GPs and 88% for cancer. That suggests Tory attempts to rubbish the NHS will fail. The public complains about access to services, and for that they blame the government. Last week the annual “mandate” from the secretary of state to NHS England laid out a deranged wishlist of 13 “objectives”, all of equal “priority”: 50m extra GP appointments each year, more levelling up, no debts and 40 new hospitals. Objective number 12 is “The NHS will continue to support its workforce” (but not with pay). This sets out the NHS as it should be, as it would be on 2010 funding rates. As it is, it sets up the NHS to fail to meet impossible goals.

4/5/2022,"When Dirty Den Watts gave his alcoholic wife a present in the Queen Vic on Christmas Day 1986, 30 million viewers were watching. “This, my sweet,” Den snarled at Angie, “is a letter from my solicitor telling you that your husband has filed a petition for divorce.” It’s easy to be wise after the event, but Angie’s mistake was to get drunk on the Orient Express on the way back from the couple’s second honeymoon in Venice and then blab to the barman that she didn’t really have only six months to live. Den, naturally, overheard this admission and realised that Angie had dreamed up the lie to bring her philandering husband (who had made 16-year-old Michelle Fowler pregnant, earning the enduring rage of her mum, Pauline) back into something like conjugal felicity. The days when a British soap could attract more than half of the population are over. Thirty-five years later, EastEnders is struggling with ratings. Last Christmas, the BBC soap pulled in just 2.9 million viewers, landing it in 10th place of the top 10 most-watched programmes on Christmas Day. The 40-minute episode promised two weddings and a big reveal (which turned out to be that Dotty Cotton isn’t Nasty Nick’s daughter, but Rocky’s), but prompted disaffection on Twitter. “What the hell was that?!?” wrote one. “Where were the two ‘actual’ weddings? Why did not a single one of them walk down the aisle?!? Where was the big Nazi storyline? That was probably the most mediocre Christmas episode ever! Why did no one die?!” I know what you’re thinking: Nazi storyline? It’s not just that, for some, soaps have lost the plot. Rather, soaps have lost their place in the national discourse. When, for instance, in Coronation Street in 1998, Deirdre (née Hunt, later Langton, Rachid and Barlow) was jailed for fraud while her conman lover, Jon Lindsay, walked free, the prime minister, Tony Blair, supported the Weatherfield One and promised to intervene. William Hague, the leader of the opposition, told the House of Commons: “The nation is deeply concerned about Deirdre – Conservatives as much as anyone else.” As late as 2009, Barbara Windsor’s Peggy Mitchell pulled a pint for the London mayor – Boris Johnson – after a tyre on his bike was punctured outside the Queen Vic. “If you have any ideas how I could help Walford,” Boris oiled at Peggy, “here’s my card.” Not the first time our leader had mistaken fiction for fact. Today such a waste of parliamentary time and stomach-churning cameos are scarcely conceivable, and not just because politicians have more important things to worry about. As the television ratings expert Stephen Price puts it: “The soaps’ dominance of traditional TV appears to be on the wane, no longer impervious to challenge from the linear opposition and losing fans to the streamers.” By “linear opposition”, he means shows such as Bradley Walsh’s Breaking Dad on ITV and BBC One’s The Repair Shop. By “streamers”, he means the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime and catchup services such as BBC iPlayer and Channel 4’s All 4. While TV viewing as a whole fell by 9% between 2017 and 2019, Coronation Street’s audience fell by 19%, while Emmerdale’s went down by 22% and EastEnders’ by 37%. All soaps are ailing, then, but last month two soaps were terminated with a ruthlessness akin to the moment in Coronation Street in 1989 when Rita Fairclough’s nemesis, Alan Bradley, was dispatched by a Blackpool tram. BBC One’s Holby City was axed after 23 years, while Channel 5 decided to stop broadcasting the 37-year-old Australian soap Neighbours, prompting its production company, Fremantle, to cancel it. Kylie Minogue, who found fame on the show as Charlene Robinson (née Mitchell), tweeted: “We had no idea how big the show would become and how passionately viewers would take it to heart. Pure love! I can still hear Madge calling … CHARLENE!!!!” Minogue was recalling Neighbours’ glory years: when Charlene married Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) in 1987, nearly 20 million Britons watched. Today, the Neighbours audience on Channel 5 averages 1.2 million – undeniably small, but double the 600,000 who watch Hollyoaks on Channel 4. “It’s sad to see Neighbours go,” says Phil Redmond, the creator of Brookside, Grange Hill and Hollyoaks. “But the truth is the world has moved on.” Television history is littered with terminated soaps: Crossroads, Eldorado, Family Affairs, Brookside. But if the axe can descend on Neighbours, a fixture on British and Australian TV for decades, perhaps no soap is safe. In response, Britain’s leading TV soaps are being moved around the schedules, but that may seem as futile as relocating the deckchairs on the Titanic. Coronation Street will broadcast three hour-long episodes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, instead of dividing Monday and Wednesday into two separate half-hour chunks with another programme in between. Also on ITV, Emmerdale has moved from 7pm to 7.30pm, Monday to Friday, in order to accommodate an hour-long ITV News programme. In response, BBC One has moved EastEnders to a consistent 7.30pm time slot, Mondays to Thursdays. Emmerdale is currently winning the 7.30pm ratings battle. Even as their ratings plummet, though, soaps are investing in the future. Despite MPs worrying about the outlay of the licence fee, the BBC spent £87m on a new set for EastEnders. A patch of wasteland next to the original set has been transformed into a new one, complete with replicas of the Mitchell brothers’ garage, the Beales’ fish-and-chip shop and, according to media-watchers’ decoding of drone footage, the dramatically rich juxtaposition of a mosque next to the Queen Vic. Last month, ITV announced that construction work has started on an expansion to the Coronation Street set, across the Manchester ship canal from MediaCityUK in Salford. “It’s a testament to the confidence ITV has in the show that it is investing so much in our future,” says John Whiston, the managing director of continuing drama and the head of ITV in the north. “Mind you, I guess it won’t be long before we blow it up, burn it down or crash a tram into it.” Are soaps still a worthwhile investment? Traditionally, they were appointment-to-view telly. After Larry Hagman’s diabolical Texas oilman, JR Ewing, was shot in 1980, 83 million people in the US tuned in to watch the episode in which his killer was revealed. Viewers had to wait from the finale of series three to the fourth episode of series four to discover whodunnit. This sort of cliffhanger, or so you would think, is inimical to the binge-watching culture of Netflix and Amazon Prime. The drum “doof-doofs” marking the cliffhanger at the end of EastEnders was predicated on deferring gratification until the next episode, when viewers would learn, for instance, if Ethel ever did find her little Willy (spoiler alert: Willy was a dog – a pug – and he usually came back). But, in 2007, the Netflix executive Ted Sarandos revolutionised how we watch TV, by drastically cutting the time between the cliffhanger and its resolution. “The television business is based on managed dissatisfaction,” Sarandos told me in 2013. “You’re watching a great television show you are really wrapped up in? You might get 50 minutes of watching a week and then 18,000 minutes of waiting until the next episode comes along. I’d rather make it all about the joy.” Another problem for soaps is that the “water-cooler effect” is no more. “There never was a water cooler – it was people talking about last night’s telly on the bus,” nitpicks Tony Jordan, a scriptwriter and series consultant who was for many years the driving force behind EastEnders. “But the principle remains: soaps were the original Fomo. You were afraid of missing out. That’s how we got audiences of upwards of 26 million.” But time-shifting technologies and binge watching don’t necessarily mean viewing is no longer communal. Beau Willimon, the creator of the Netflix drama House of Cards, argues that the end of the singular, common viewing experience has been replaced by smaller “concentric circles” of conversation. He has a point: the water-cooler effect may be obsolete, but it has been replaced by virtual communities. Live-tweeting your joy at the return of Ozark or your disappointment at Killing Eve’s lamentable new series on a mobile device to fellow fans while watching on another screen is what communal TV looks like in the digital age. It is also simplistic to say that soaps are merely victims of streaming; they have also been beneficiaries of catchup services. Last summer, for instance, ITV bosses decided to add weeks’ worth of episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale to ITV Hub during the World Cup so that football fans could binge-watch between their favourite matches. It’s unwise to go too far with this argument, though. Take viewing figures for 14-20 March. The most-watched TV show was the penultimate episode of The Apprentice on BBC One, which had 6.7 million viewers, 2.1 million of whom watched not live, but on catchup services, notably iPlayer. By contrast, Coronation Street, that week’s top-rated soap, was watched by 5.5 million viewers, only 716,000 of whom saw it on catchup, notably ITV Hub, suggesting that soaps are more dependent on appointment-to-view main channel telly than any other TV format. Redmond argues that soaps’ main problem is not streaming, multichannel TV or the multiplication from a TV set in the living room to phones, tablets and other mobile devices. Rather, soap operas have sold their souls and thereby hastened their demise. “They have spread themselves too thinly, so they are disconnected from reality. They should spend more time on scripts and developing characters. For some reason, humans just want dramatic stories; the problem is that soaps aren’t providing them. It’s a temptation to sensationalise – I know, I’ve done it myself – but it’s a short-term fix. Quality control is what’s important,” he says. Traditionally, British soap operas postured as slice-of-life telly, tackling issues such as racism, sexism, violence against women, suicide and cot death in a serious manner that you would never see in US soaps such as Dallas or Dynasty. They also helped to develop ordinary Britons’ political and emotional literacy, argues Jordan. When the heterosexual Mark Fowler was diagnosed as HIV-positive in EastEnders in 1991, Britons brought up by the tabloids to believe it was a “gay plague” were dramatically disabused. Similarly, says Jordan, “When someone got cancer and struggled with it, that may have helped some people who thought they were weak, but realised they were just struggling, as was the character on the soap.” Jordan hails soap writers such as Sarah Phelps (EastEnders) and Sally Wainwright (Coronation Street), whose angry passion for such issue-based dramas made them essential viewing. When Coronation Street began in December 1960, its terraced Victorian street looked just like the one lived in by millions of Britons and caught the wave of kitchen-sink realism generated by John Osborne in the theatre and Lindsay Anderson at the cinema. Jordan argues that soaps came into their own as Britain became socially fragmented. We needed good neighbours on TV, perhaps, because they were less likely to exist in real life. “One thing that made EastEnders popular is that you wanted to live there,” says Jordan. “It was a community, when communities were disappearing. It was a rule on the show that nobody ever said: ‘This place is shit – I’m off to Watford or Barbados.’ Viewers had to want to live at No 3 Coronation Street or Albert Square … they’d fit in to the community and Den Watts could be their landlord.” Soaps’ social integrity was undone in the quest for ratings. A pivotal moment came when an aeroplane crashed into Beckindale during Emmerdale’s ratings-grabbing 1993 Christmas special. But sensational storylines need not show that a soap has lost its soul. Jordan recalls being deeply moved as a teenager as he watched a 1967 episode of Coronation Street in which a train derailed crossing the viaduct, crashing into the cobbles, trapping Ena Sharples and killing Sonia Peters. “It had integrity because the community came together,” he says. He contrasts that with the notorious EastEnders storyline from 2011 in which Ronnie Branning switched her dead baby with Kat Slater’s newborn child, which prompted more than 9,000 complaints, many from bereaved parents objecting to its seemingly cynical sensationalism. Nine years ago, I wrote an article for the Guardian headlined: “Soap operas: has the bubble burst?” In it, I argued: “Soaps are like printed newspapers or the British monarchy – the only question is when they will do the equivalent of stopping the presses or making the last royal hanger-on live without taxpayer subsidy in a council flat.” You will have noticed that there are still printed newspapers and that no royal, not even Prince Andrew, lives in a council flat. Perhaps, like the death of Mark Twain, their demise has been exaggerated. “There’s no reason why soaps can’t survive,” argues Jordan. “But I’m not an idiot. I know that in the days when there were 30 million viewers for EastEnders there were only four channels and now choice is virtually unlimited. I can do the maths. But there is a place for them, and a substantial audience, too, as long as they are written by – and seen by – people who care about the characters and their stories.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘What the hell was that episode?!’ Can the soaps ever win viewers back?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/05/what-the-hell-was-that-episode-can-the-soaps-ever-win-viewers-back
4/5/2022,"If you are over a certain age, you will recall the weird, interstitial era that came between the halcyon days of dialling 192 for free directory enquiries and the full onset of the Internet Age. In those liminal days, if you wanted to find a phone number, one of your options, other than flicking through a telephone directory, was to call 118 118, which a TV ad campaign aggressively encouraged you to do. These ads featured two skinny blokes – apparently twins – wearing 70s facial hair and running vests numbered “118” who’d jog around to a version of the Ghostbusters theme (“Who ya gonna call?”). In my imagination, the Gleeson twins – universally known in Ambridge as “One of Them” and “the Other One” – resemble the 118 118 characters, committed runners that they are. Possibly they circle the village ceaselessly, locked together like Francesca and Paolo in Dante’s Inferno. They never speak; they were cheerfully hailed this month by Tracy, but answer came there none. Once upon a time, we learn, they were champion ballroom dancers, until One of Them injured his ankle and the Other One gave up his glorious career in solidarity. Now they are reduced to eating eggs benedict at Grey Gables and being the subject of gossip between Ian Craig and Susan Carter, the most unlikely friendship in the history of Ambridge. Moving on. I don’t mean to make a trite comparison here (OK, maybe I do) but the stage we are at in the Chris-Alice divorce now seems to me to resemble the moment in about September 2020 when it began to dawn on the populace that, despite the prime minister’s airy pronouncements back in the spring that Covid would All Be Over in 12 weeks, we’d be lucky if we’d be out of it in two, or even three, years. I suppose there is the faintest chance that Chris’s one-night stand with Alice’s best mate Amy (and I’m still shuddering at the mention of the word “bra” on Radio 4 outwith the safe space of Woman’s Hour) will precipitate a grand reconciliation, but I doubt it. Were one to plot Chris and Alice’s personal trajectories on a graph, you’d see that their lines have now, fatefully, crossed. He’s plunging, she’s rising up, increasingly magnificent and implacable (and sober). She’s even faced down Susan in the shop – not bad when you consider that she chucked a brick through its window in a drunken rage only months ago. All she wants is Her Baby, which is all he wants, too. The gods of Ambridge will be plotting the courtroom drama even now. I will not be discussing those appalling goldfish, Kate and Roy. I love animals but they both need to die.",Arts/Television & radio,"Charlotte Higgins on The Archers: like a Bojo promise, Alice and Chris’s divorce moves into parody",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/05/charlotte-higgins-on-the-archers-like-a-bojo-promise-alice-and-chriss-divorce-moves-into-parody
4/5/2022,"Crab and lobster have been classed as “fish to avoid” by the Marine Conservation Society in its new UK guide to sustainable seafood, due to concern over whales getting entangled in Scottish fishing gear. Monkfish from the North Sea and the west of Scotland, where populations have declined to their lowest since 2013, have also joined the guide’s list of “fish to avoid”, alongside most skates and rays. Skates and rays are in decline globally, with a third of species facing extinction due to overfishing. The charity said its latest assessment of UK seafood shows a need for more rigorous management of British seas, as well as revealing a glaring data gap of fish and seafood stocks in Scottish waters. Fourteen species of fish and seafood have joined the MCS’s “fish to avoid” list. Ten were added last year. The MCS said the picture was concerning as it “was moving in the wrong direction”. “The latest Good Fish Guide ratings – where all new UK ratings are either amber or red rated – illustrate the urgent need for transparency and better management if we’re to recover fish stocks in UK seas,” said Clara Johnston, fisheries policy manager at the MCS. Crab and lobster populations are suffering as a result of poor management generally. In the west of Scotland, however, there is particular concern that migrating whales are getting entangled in ropes attached to crab and lobster pots more frequently. A study last year by Nature Scotland found increasing entanglements of cetaceans, sharks and turtles in crab and lobster creels. Reported entanglements were most likely to be minke whales or basking sharks, but 95% of entanglements went unreported, the study said. The waters around Skye were the riskiest for interactions between creels fleets and whales. Charlotte Coombes, MCS’s good fish guide manager, explained: “The migrating whales are funnelled between the mainland and the islands. Some of the evidence suggest the minke whales are not as strong swimmers as humpbacks, so minkes are more affected.” Recent data suggest that 2.2% of the local minke population may be killed through entanglement each year. Except for in Shetland, there are no limits to the number of pots that fishers can put in the water in Scotland. The decline in monkfish in the North Sea and the west of Scotland is also worrying, added Coombes. “There are catch limits and that does help. But the limits apply to a wider area, so there is room for the population to be taken at higher quantities than it can sustain.” Nine types of Scottish brown crab and lobster were classified differently in this year’s guide: eight were either “fish to avoid” (or amber, under the MCS’s traffic light system), while only one, Shetland brown crab, was rated as “best choice” (a green traffic light). There was some good news: 10 types of fish and shellfish were now in the “best choice” category, including sardines from off south-west England and North Sea herring. There are 656 species ratings in all, with 161 now listed as “avoid” and 148 as “best choice”. The Future Fisheries Alliance, a coalition between the MCS, WWF and the RSPB, is calling for fisheries management to be to strengthened. It wants to see the current draft of the Joint Fisheries Statement, due to be published at the end of the year, include targets for recovery of depleted fish populations via more effective management, a commitment to install remote electronic monitoring on vessels and urgent action to tackle wildlife bycatch.",News/Environment,"Much of Scottish crab and lobster is ‘fish to avoid’, says sustainable seafood guide",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/much-of-scottish-crab-and-lobster-is-fish-to-avoid-says-sustainable-seafood-guide
