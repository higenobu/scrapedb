5/1/2022,"Even when he was being feted as one of the key players on the late-00s chillwave scene, it was clear that Chaz Bear’s achilles heel was that his production skills comfortably eclipsed his ability to write actual memorable songs. A decade on, his seventh album as Toro y Moi suggests that not much has changed. Woozily maximalist psychedelia meshes with disengaged, treated vocals, funk basslines (Postman) and lo-NRG disco (Millennium), and it all sounds suitably opulent. Every so often, the disparate elements coalesce into something special, most notably on the gorgeous Days in Love, which would have sat nicely on Tame Impala’s Lonerism. Almost as good is the gently seductive Goes By So Fast, which echoes English Riviera-era Metronomy. Just as frequently, however, the disparate elements remain resolutely just that, and the resulting sketches sound frustratingly half-baked. It’s possible to listen to Foreplay several times in quick succession without it leaving even the faintest trace in the memory. Likewise, Déjà Vu is so instantly forgettable it might have been better titled Jamais Entendu. Mahal is ultimately too uneven to be an album to particularly cherish.",Arts/Music,Toro y Moi: Mahal review – gently seductive but frustratingly half-baked,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/01/toro-y-moi-mahal-review-gently-seductive-but-frustratingly-half-baked
5/1/2022,"The revelation that almost half of single men don’t change their bed sheets for up to four months conjures memories and smells from my former life as a slob, although I doubt many of today’s bachelors are as bad as I was. At 22, I didn’t need to change sheets because I slept on a bare mattress. I did very little laundry, in part because each week I bought five pairs of socks for a pound from Primark and tossed them into the bin, which I rarely emptied, after one wear. At the same time, I knew this behaviour wasn’t healthy, and I don’t believe anyone really wants to live in filth. I felt embarrassed by my untidiness without addressing it. Towards the end of my first year at university, there were room inspections at our halls of residence and I was told, in front of my flatmates, that mine was disgusting. I had 24 hours to fix the problem, pending a second inspection, so I ran around Leeds, buying disinfectant, air fresheners and sheets, feeling sick with shame. Twenty years later, I have not completely left behind bad hygiene. Recently, I had to scrub my office chair (I work from home) after my wife found me at my desk after I’d been running. I had become distracted en route to the shower, fallen down an internet rabbit hole and was sitting there reeking of sweat. I suspect one of the reasons single men don’t change their sheets is that to yourself you never smell truly awful. It’s not a woman’s job to fix a man, and Silvia Federici and others have written important feminist critiques of the politics of housework, but I dread to think where I’d be if I were single. When my wife goes away for a night or two, I regress. “Might as well relax while I’m the only one here,” I think, and soon there are greasy plates piling up, fingerprinted tumblers on the coffee table and, yes, an unmade bed. It’s a long road to zero-slobbery and you need to be vigilant. As that sage of male solitude Henry David Thoreau said: “It is best to avoid the beginnings of evil.” Before judging these single men we should remember that changing sheets is difficult, especially for one person: you tuck in a side, walk around the bed, try to secure the bottom corner and the opposite one comes undone. It is much easier for a couple but, even so, my wife and I growl at each other every other Sunday: “Pull it tighter!” How come then 62% of single women change their sheets fortnightly? Perhaps there’s a whiff of male entitlement, of the quaintly dishevelled variety, at play. I doubt Boris Johnson changes his sheets often, or at least he wouldn’t if he didn’t have somebody else to do it for him. I laughed at the scene in Kingsley Amis’s novel Lucky Jim, when the protagonist burns his bedsheets with a cigarette then hides them from his host, without considering who would clean up afterwards. In The Bachelor Home Companion, meanwhile, the late American humorist PJ O’Rourke advised: “Sheets can be kept clean by getting drunk and falling asleep with your clothes on.” Looking back on my years of squalor, it strikes me that I never thought it was worth making my environment pleasant for myself. I lacked self-respect, but over the years I gained some by changing my habits. So much of life is about habit. Once you get into good ones, it becomes easier. But you must remember that bad habits are always lurking beneath the surface, or in this case beneath the covers.

5/1/2022,"When an athleisure jacket racks up 2.8bn views on a social media platform with reviewers praising its ability to create an hourglass silhouette, you know it’s a signal that this is a body shape that is – dare we say it – trending. Lululemon’s Define jacket has been dubbed the Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) top for its instant sculpting effect, thanks to a bit of Lycra and clever tailoring. Countless young women have shared videos on TikTok of themselves zipping and unzipping the snug-fitting top and doing a celebratory dance. “BBL for the win,” said one. The hourglass is currently the biggest shape in fashion. “We’re seeing an industry-wide obsession with hyper-femininity,” says Katie Devlin, fashion researcher at the trends intelligence agency Stylus. “There’s been a change in the types of bodies that we see represented in fashion, [marking] a definite shift towards embracing curvier, more womanly figures.” Last week Victoria Beckham launched VB Body, a capsule collection of body-contouring dresses, bralettes and leggings, which, she said in a recent interview, “really do cinch you in at all the right places, and give you a nice round bottom or a defined waist”. Like it or not, Kim Kardashian was here first. “She’s been pushing this hourglass thing for years,” says the author and Central Saint Martins fashion lecturer Harriet Worsley. “Fashion is finally catching up with her.” Kardashian launched her own shapewear line, Skims, in September 2020, and has introduced size-inclusive garments such as a waist trainer, and cycling shorts that flatten tummies and “enhance the natural shape of your butt”. With many of us coming out of lockdown with quite a bit more body to sculpt than before we went in, it’s perhaps not surprising that Selfridges, which stocks Skims, reports a “huge spike” in its sales – “and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down”, says Grace Neal, a womenswear buyer there. “We’ve seen an increase of 118% of Skims sales versus the previous year.” However, she adds, customers are looking for something a little different these days. “They aren’t necessarily looking for shapewear to make them look thinner,” she says, “but to enhance the body they already have.” “Historically, shapewear has always been incredibly restrictive and uncomfortable,” says Devlin. “The main point of it in the past has been to make the wearer as small and as skinny as possible. While restriction still plays a part, these brands are celebrating different parts of the body that previously no one would have wanted in their silhouette.” Parts of your body, she means, such as hips and bottoms that accentuate the hourglass aesthetic. The American singer Lizzo’s new shapewear line, Yitty, which launched on 12 April, goes even further in celebrating a fuller female form. Its clothes are not designed to be hidden away and worn in secret shame, but as (very tight) garments in their own right. Vests, cycling shorts and bodysuits, in electric blue, neon yellow and a bold butterfly-wing print can be worn “as an under layer or shown off”, says the website. Modelling some of the range herself, Lizzo is very much doing the latter (similarly, VB Body is, Beckham has said, a mixture of “shapewear and womenswear in one”). In a recent Instagram post, Lizzo said: “I’m sick of people telling me how I’m supposed to look and feel about my body. I’m tired of discomfort being synonymous with sexy. Yitty isn’t just shapewear, it’s your chance to reclaim your body and redefine your beauty standard.” The American plus-size influencer and beauty entrepreneur Katie Sturino welcomes the new shapewear. “I love the fact that someone with my size can actually wear something that 20 years ago you’d only see on a Calvin Klein model.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Behind the curve: shapewear trend shows time of the hourglass has come ,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/01/behind-the-curve-shapewear-trend-shows-time-of-the-hourglass-has-come
