4/15/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Oleksandr Kozkukhar KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv early on Friday, and air raid sirens blared across Ukraine as residents braced for new Russian attacks after Moscow's lead warship in the Black Sea sank following a fire. The explosions appeared to be among the most significant in Ukraine's capital region since Russian troops pulled back from the area earlier this month in preparation for battles in the south and east. Ukraine claimed responsibility for sinking the Moskva, saying the Soviet-era flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet was struck by one of its missiles. The vessel sank late on Thursday as it was being towed to port, Russia's defence ministry said. Over 500 crew aboard the missile cruiser were evacuated after ammunition on board exploded, the ministry said, without acknowledging an attack. Ukraine says it hit the warship with a locally made Neptune anti-ship missile. The ship's loss comes as Russia's navy continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities on the Black Sea nearly 50 days after it launched the invasion. Residents of Odesa and Mariupol, on the adjacent Azov Sea, have been bracing for new Russian attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy alluded to the sunken warship in an early morning video address in which he warned of Russian intentions to target the eastern Donbas region, including Mariupol. Zelenskiy paid homage to all ""those who halted the progress of the endless convoys of Russian military equipment ... Those who showed that Russian ships can go ... down to the bottom."" There were no immediate reports of damage following the explosions reported in Kyiv, Kherson in the south, the eastern city of Kharkiv and the town of Ivano-Frankivsk in the west. Ukrainian media reported electricity outages in parts of Kyiv. Air raid sirens went off in all regions of Ukraine just after midnight on Friday and continued blaring in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia even after those elsewhere went quiet, Ukrainian media said. Reuters could not immediately verify the reports. MOSKVA Whatever the cause of the Moskva's loss, the episode is a setback for Russia. If Ukraine's assertion that it hit the ship in a missile strike turns out to be true, the attack will go down in history as one of the highest-profile naval attacks so far this century. Russia's defence ministry said it is investigating the cause of the fire on board. The United States said it did not have enough information to determine whether the Moskva was hit by a missile. ""(But) certainly, the way this unfolded, it's a big blow to Russia,"" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Russian forces have pulled back from some northern parts of Ukraine after suffering heavy losses and failing to capture Kyiv. Ukraine and its Western allies say Moscow is redeploying for a new offensive in the eastern Donbas region. Russia launched its assault in part to dissuade Ukraine from joining NATO. But the invasion has pushed Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, and nearby Sweden to consider joining the U.S.-led military alliance. Moscow warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland join, Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea, in the heart of Europe. Commenting on Russia's military setbacks, CIA Director William Burns said the threat of Russia potentially using nuclear weapons in Ukraine cannot be taken lightly, but that the agency has not seen much practical evidence reinforcing that concern. BATTLE FOR MARIUPOL Moscow describes its invasion as a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies say Russia has launched an unprovoked war that has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad and killed or wounded thousands. Russia's navy has fired cruise missiles into Ukraine and its Black Sea activities are crucial to supporting land operations in the south and east, where it is battling to seize full control of Mariupol. Russia said on Wednesday that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines from one of the units still holding out in Mariupol had surrendered. Ukrainian officials did not comment. If taken, Mariupol would be the first major city to fall to Russian forces since they invaded, allowing Moscow to reinforce a land corridor between separatist-held eastern Donbas areas and the Crimea region it seized and annexed in 2014. Ukraine said tens of thousands of people were believed to have been killed in Mariupol, where efforts were under way to evacuate civilians. Russia's defence ministry said late on Thursday that 815 people had been evacuated from the city over the past 24 hours. Ukraine said that figure was 289.

4/15/2022,"Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva has sunk following an explosion aboard, officials say. Ukrainian forces claim to have hit the ship with missiles, but Western officials could not confirm that on Thursday. While the details remain unclear, the incident is seen as a significant blow to the Russian navy. The Russian Black Fleet flagship, the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, sank on Thursday, according to Russian officials. Ukrainian forces claim to have struck the Russian cruiser with a long-range missile launched from shore. Russian officials said a fire had caused ammunition to explode but did not say what caused the fire. Western officials said Thursday morning that there was not enough information to attribute the fire to a specific cause. The damage to the Russian flagship appeared extensive. Even before reports of the ship's loss, the incident was seen as a ""significant blow"" to Russia's navy, Western officials said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that their forces struck the Russian warship with Neptune anti-ship missiles. One official said the Moskva was ""drowned."" Russian state media later said the warship was afloat, its main armaments were intact, and the fire had been localized, implying it has been contained but perhaps not extinguished. A senior US defense official, speaking anonymously to describe developing events in Ukraine, told reporters on Thursday that Moskva was believed to have ""experienced significant damage"" and was still ""battling a fire, but we do not know the extent of the damage,"" what caused that damage, or whether there are casualties. Russian Navy ships in the northern Black Sea moved south as the Moskva battled a severe fire, the US official said. Western officials have called Ukraine's claims ""credible"" and said the Russian account of a fire breaking out aboard was ""difficult to believe,"" but the US official wouldn't rule out an accident. ""The risk of fire is ever present and potential for explosions are also ever present, particularly on a surface combatant, which is designed in this case for air defense,"" the US defense official said, pointing to the munitions and fuel that a ship like Moskva would be carrying. This would be the first known use of the Ukrainian-developed Neptune missiles. The Neptune is capable of striking land and sea targets within a 200-mile range. It's the first mid-range cruise missile produced by Ukraine and designed primarily to strike warships, like the Moskva. The cruiser was between 60 and 65 nautical miles south of the port city of Odesa when it experienced an explosion. ""Sixty miles is well within the Neptune's effective range but it also could have been something else,"" the US official said. The US official called the fire ""extensive"" and ""significant"" but said it's unclear if there is damage to the hull. The warship does appear to be sailing east, however. ""Our assumption is that she'll be heading to Sevastopol for repairs, but that's really all we can say,"" the US official said. Roughly a half-dozen ships were ""fairly dispersed"" in the northern Black Sea at the time of the explosion, according to the US official, who said that four or five those ships, which were ""as close or closer"" to the coast as the Moskva, ""have all moved south."" ""At this point, we hold them no closer than about 80 nautical miles from the coast, but ships move and I can't predict where there'll be an hour from now,"" the US official added. That movement has raised speculation that Russian commanders are trying to increase the distance between their ships and Ukrainian coastal defenses, which are being bolstered by weaponry provided by Western countries. The Moskva is perhaps best known for involvement in the attack on Ukraine's Snake Island at the start of the Russian invasion. When asked by the Russian fleet to surrender, Ukrainian guards on the island were heard saying ""Russian warship, go f--- yourself."" Speaking Thursday, however, the US official couldn't confirm that Moskva had been involved in that incident. Since then, Moskva has been active around Odesa. The Russians have repeatedly sent landing ships toward the port but diverted them at the last moment, tying up Ukrainian forces in the area with threats of an assault. While the circumstances are unclear, the damage to Moskva is significant for Russia, which will be unable to reinforce its ships in the Black Sea following Turkey's closure of the sea to warships at the outset of the conflict. Alessio Patalano, an expert on naval warfare in East Asia at King's College London, called it ""one of the most severe naval losses since the Falklands War."" ""Tonight Russian commanders will feel less secure as they reflect upon the fact that the [Black Sea] is no longer their lake. It's a box with no way out,"" Patalano said. ""Things have got much harder.""

4/15/2022,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday said it is “nice” of the state of Texas to bus illegal immigrants from the border to Washington, D.C., hours after the first bus out of Texas arrived blocks away from the U.S. Capitol building. Last week, Abbott announced that Texas would be sending willing illegal immigrants to Washington, D.C., by bus and plane in response to the Biden administration’s recent announcement that it will lift Title 42, a Trump-era public-health order that has allowed U.S. border officials to quickly expel migrant families to Mexico, next month. “These are all migrants who have been processed by CBP and are free to travel, so it’s nice the state of Texas is helping them get to their final destination as they await the outcome of their immigration proceedings — and they’re all in immigration proceedings,” Psaki said when asked during a press briefing about the first bus arriving on Wednesday. The bus carried dozens of migrants from the Del Rio sector in Texas. The migrants were released into Texas’s border communities by the federal government after coming to the U.S. from Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, Fox News reported. After the bus arrived in the Capitol, the migrants checked in with officials and had wristbands they were wearing removed before being allowed to leave, the report added. Psaki had previously called Abbott’s policy a “publicity stunt.” The state has sent an undisclosed number of buses to the border communities impacted by an influx of migrants, but the Texas Division of Emergency Management said each bus “has the capacity and supplies necessary to carry up to 40 migrants.” The state has a pool of up to 900 buses for the operation, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said last week, according to CNN. “From the [Rio Grande Valley] to Terrell County, a large majority of the communities that originally reached out for support through this operation have now said that the federal government has stopped dropping migrants in their towns since the governor’s announcement on Wednesday,” Seth Christensen, chief of media and communications for TDEM, told Fox News last week. Meanwhile, Psaki doubled down on her criticism of another of Abbott’s policies during the press briefing on Wednesday, this time calling the governor’s order to carry out “enhanced safety inspections” of vehicles that pass through ports of entry a “political stunt.” Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to carry out the enhanced inspections last week over concern about “cartels that smuggle illicit contraband and people across our southern border.” The governor suggested there will be an increase in smuggling when Title 42 ends. On Wednesday morning, Psaki released a statement that said: “Governor Abbott’s unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains, delaying manufacturing, impacting jobs, and raising prices for families in Texas and across the country.” During the briefing, Psaki was asked if she is blaming Abbott for inflation. “Well I think we’re trying to state the facts of what is another political stunt that we’re seeing happen and the impact of it,” Psaki replied. “What we’re seeing is right now, factually, there’s over $1 million in trade crossing over the U.S.-Mexico border every minute. These actions are impacting people’s jobs and the livelihoods of hardworking families in Texas and across the country.” She went on to say that the “unnecessary inspections” are causing “significant delays, which are resulting in a drop in commercial traffic of up to 60 to 70 percent in some ports.” However, the country has been contending with soaring inflation for months now. A Labor Department report released Tuesday showed the Consumer Price Index, a major inflation gauge measuring the cost of the average household basket of goods, came in at 8.5 percent over the 12-month period ending in March. The rise is the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981.

4/15/2022,"San Dieguito Union High School District Superintendent Cheryl James-Ward has apologized for remarks that stereotyped Asian students as high-achievers from high-income families.

The official’s comments, seen as perpetuating the model minority myth, were reportedly made during a board training session on Monday on diversity, equity and inclusion.

Citing data that showed Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese students getting fewer D and F grades than other ethnic or racial groups, Michael Allman, a board trustee, asked James-Ward, “Do we know why Asian students do so well in school?”

In response, the superintendent said it’s because those students are from rich families coming from China.

“We have an influx of Asians from China, and the people who are able to make that journey are wealthy,” James-Ward said. “You cannot come to America and buy a house for $2 million unless you have money.”

She then cited her own community as an example.

“In my community, in Carmel Valley... we had a large influx of Chinese families moving in, sight unseen, into our homes, into the community, and that requires money.”

James-Ward added that entire families — including grandparents — immigrate to the U.S., allowing for a strong support system for students at home. On the other hand, some Latinx families simply “don’t have that type of money,” and parents work jobs that leave them with no time to help their children.

The official’s remarks quickly drew criticism from the community. The Californians for Equal Rights Foundation, whose leaders are Chinese American, said in a statement that her comments were “deeply offensive, grossly inaccurate and intentionally divisive, which ill-fits her leadership role in a major school district,” according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

 

A video of James-Ward’s remarks was also posted on YouTube and has been viewed more than 4,000 times. YouTube commenters responded by pointing out the diversity of Asian communities, as well as the value of meritocracy.

“Absolutely shameful and ignorant comments. My parents are the perfect example of how hard work and discipline can lead to success in America. To study hard and achieve academically is the least I can do to respect their efforts. This was true back when I was in high school and college and remains true today,” a YouTube user commented.

Others took the opportunity to highlight their own hard work.

“Unbelievable pre-judgement and stereotype. I came to the United States 24 years ago, with only 200$ in my pocket. I lived in a basement, I worked in buffet restaurants and I walked more than 1.5 hours one way to the campus even during the coldest winter storm in Pennsylvania,” one user wrote. “Even under all the stress, I still managed to get two masters degrees within 2.5 years from a top 30 university, straight A. Don't be arrogant saying ‘wealth’ is the only reason Asians do good at school.”

“I’m an immigrant from China. I came here with $720 dollars in my pocket. In my first five years in school, I worked almost all weekends and holidays,” another commented. “Now both my wife and I have busy work. But we spend at least one hour per night with our kids when they are young. Our TV is not allowed to turn on on weekdays. We teach our kids the values of hard work. We told our kids if they fail at school work, they are the ones to be blamed, not other people or other ethnic groups. This superintendent doesn’t want less advanced students to work hard so she can stay in power.”

James-Ward reportedly responded to the backlash in an interview by saying her comments were taken out of context to cause a “firestorm.” The superintendent reportedly also faced a recent dispute relating to redistricting.

“I should’ve said it differently, right, because the issue is very complex. I should’ve just left it at ‘complex,’” she said.

Following the interview with the San Diego Union-Tribune, James-Ward called the reporter back to apologize for her comments, stating,

“If I harmed any member of my community, I am deeply sorry, and that would never be my intent.”
