1/6/2022,"Pablo Neruda may have won the Nobel prize for literature in 1971, but newly opened archives in Stockholm reveal the judging panel’s concerns about the Chilean poet’s “communist tendencies”. The list of writers in the running for the Nobel prize, and the deliberations of the secretive members of the judging panel at the Swedish Academy, are kept confidential for 50 years. But the newly opened archives show that, although 1971’s winner Neruda was praised by the prize-givers for “a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent’s destiny and dreams”, behind the scenes some members of the Swedish Academy were hesitant.  They questioned how works such as Neruda’s odes to Stalin fitted with Alfred Nobel’s stipulation that the prize go to “the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction” – according to journalist Kaj Schueler, who researched the Swedish Academy’s documents from 1971 for the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. While the Nobel committee chair Anders Österling praised Neruda’s “poetic natural power and dynamic vitality”, he questioned whether “the increasingly dominant communist tendency in his poetry is compatible with the purpose of the Nobel prize”. Neruda, known for his passionate, romantic poetry, was also a leftwing politician and diplomat, and close friend of President Salvador Allende. Neruda died days after Augusto Pinochet’s military coup in 1973, under circumstances that have since been investigated. “A writer’s way of thinking – whether Marxist, syndicalist, anarchist or something else – belongs to his free right. However, Neruda is fully politically involved, including through his hymns to Stalin and other purely propagandistic achievements. On that basis, I have reservations about his candidacy, without, however, wanting to firmly reject it in advance,” wrote Österling in 1963 – an opinion that he continued to hold in 1971, according to Schueler. Österling had previously spoken out against the candidacy of Ezra Pound because he “propagates ideas of a nature that is definitely contrary to the spirit of the Nobel prize”, and Samuel Beckett, because of his nihilism. Österling was eventually persuaded of Neruda’s merits, and Beckett won the prize in 1969, but Pound never did. The opening of the archives also shows that WH Auden, James Baldwin, Philip Larkin and Jorge Luis Borges were all nominated for the 1971 award. Auden made the shortlist, along with Patrick White, André Malraux and Eugenio Montale. White (in 1973) and Montale (1975) would later win, but Malraux and Auden never did. The list of 90 writers nominated for the 1971 Nobel includes just one woman: the Estonian poet Marie Under.",Arts/Books,Nobel winner Pablo Neruda was almost denied prize because of odes to Stalin,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/05/pablo-neruda-nobel-prize-almost-denied-odes-to-stalin
1/6/2022,"The forthcoming economic crisis analysed by the Resolution Foundation (UK households warned of ‘year of the squeeze’ as cost of living soars, 29 December) is partly based on a view that wage growth is stagnant. This is true for a wide range of employees but not necessarily for all. In fact, earnings growth in the year to October was 4.9%, matching consumer price index inflation, in part buoyed up by labour market shortages. If we follow the Office for National Statistics’ breakdown of sectors, average earnings in the private sector grew by 5.4% in the year to October, while in the public sector the growth rate was 2.7%. So 2022 is set to be yet another tough year for public sector employees. Further analysis of the different parts of the private sector shows average earnings growing by 7.7% in the finance and business services sector, contrasting with a low rate of 2.8% in manufacturing. Pay growth for some is quite strong, while for others it is very weak and certainly below the rate of inflation.Alastair HatchettIncomes Data Research   Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/6/2022,"A “vaccination doubt line” set up by doctors in the Netherlands is receiving up to 1,000 calls a day from people who are still unsure whether or not they should get jabbed against the coronavirus. The helpline, originally launched as a local service in November by Robin Peeters, an endocrinologist at the Erasmus medical centre in Rotterdam, and Shakib Sana, a GP, was given a national number last month and has been inundated with inquiries.  Staffed mainly by volunteer medical students from rooms made available in the university hospitals of Utrecht, Amsterdam, Nijmegen, Maastricht and Rotterdam, the service has met “an extraordinary response”, Peeters said. He told the Dutch public broadcaster NOS that there appeared to be more “doubters” than anti-vaxxers among the unvaccinated population. “The more you can help people come to a decision and limit hospital admissions, the better,” he said. Peeters said callers to the line, which is open from 8.30am to 4.30pm, fell into three main categories. First, those with questions about their individual medical situation: whether the jab would make their migraines worse, or interact with their medication. There were also a large number of questions about pregnancy and fertility and Covid-19 vaccines, as well as possible side-effects. The answers to many such specific questions could not be found on government information websites, he said. “The strength of a telephone helpline is that people can call anonymously and ask independent medical professionals,” he said. “People get their information from all sorts of unreliable sources, so there’s a need for independent advice.” Before Christmas the line received 4,400 calls over five days, Dutch media have reported. The students log every question they receive, and have access to a database containing fully referenced answers to the most common queries. Whenever they are unsure about an answer, they can contact specialists such as immunologists, gynaecologists and allergists – for more specific information. “The aim is to give every caller an appropriate and correct answer,” Peeters said. Conversations with the few committed anti-vaxxers who call are kept as short as possible, with the students trained to always ask whether the caller has a specific medical question. If not, they move on to the next caller. The objective is expressly not to pressure anyone into getting vaccinated, Peeters told the Gelderlander newspaper. “We want them to come to their own decision – we just want them to base it on correct information,” he said.",News/World news,"Covid ‘vaccination doubt line’ receiving up to 1,000 calls a day in the Netherlands ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/covid-vaccination-doubt-line-receiving-up-to-1000-calls-a-day-in-the-netherlands
1/6/2022,"The Göteborg film festival is no stranger to stunts. It has previously featured screenings for a single audience member at a North Sea lighthouse, as well as “coffin screenings” in which lucky viewers were interred inside a sarcophagus to enhance their sensory empathy. This year, festival directors are planning to put the entire audience under by hiring a hypnotist for three gala screenings. Ahead of Swedish premieres for Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Memoria, Shirin Neshat’s Land of Dreams and Christian Tafdrup’s Speak No Evil, a hypnotist will appear on stage to “transform the audience’s state of mind in accordance with the mood and theme of the film”.  Organisers said the spell would be broken after the screening. They did not comment on what would happen if the hypnotist became unavailable between the opening or closing credits – or what the effect would be on audience members who might, for instance, need to access the bathroom during the film. Memoria, whose running time is nearly three hours, is the most prominent among the films: a near dialogue-free English language debut for its Thai director with Tilda Swinton playing seemingly the only person on Earth able to hear new sonic booms. Göteborg artistic director Jonas Holmberg explained that the experiment was intended to “raise questions about submission, transgression and control” made more pertinent during the pandemic. “Watching a film in the cinema can be extremely hypnotic,” he added. ““At home, with a tablet, it is much harder to maintain the focus you need to get really absorbed by a film. The Hypnotic Cinema is both a tribute to and an extension of the experience of watching films at the movie theatre.” The Goteborg film festival runs for 10 days from 28 January.",Arts/Film,Audiences to be put in hypnotic trance at Swedish film festival,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/audiences-to-be-put-in-hypnotic-trance-at-swedish-film-festival
1/6/2022,"Thousands of Tigrayans are being deported from Saudi Arabia and held in secret detention sites in Ethiopia, according to Human Rights Watch. In a new report, the international rights organisation says it has identified two detention sites where thousands of people from the war-torn Tigray region of Ethiopia are being mistreated and forcibly disappeared. The sites, identified via satellite imagery, videos and witness accounts, in the towns of Semera and Shone are most likely used to detain Tigrayan deportees, HRW said.  The HRW report also includes testimony from returnees who claim that they were abused and beaten while in custody in Saudi Arabia. “Tigrayan migrants who have experienced horrific abuse in Saudi custody are being locked up in detention facilities upon returning to Ethiopia,” said Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Saudi Arabia should offer protection to Tigrayans at risk, while Ethiopia should release all arbitrarily detained Tigrayan deportees,” she said. Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians have migrated over the past decade, travelling by boat across the Red Sea and then by land through Yemen to Saudi Arabia. The causes of this migration include conflict, economic hardship, drought and human rights abuses. In January 2021, the Ethiopian government announced it would cooperate in the repatriation of 40,000 of its nationals detained in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of the returnees from Saudi Arabia between November 2020 and June 2021 were Tigrayan, according to HRW. The 23 Tigrayans interviewed for the report are undocumented migrant workers who were rounded up in Saudi Arabia and say they were also subjected to abuses there, including beatings and overcrowding. Many spent up to six years in formal and informal detention facilities in the kingdom. After being deported to Ethiopia, they were held in facilities throughout the country, HRW said: in centres across Addis Ababa; in Semera, Afar region; in Shone, in a state known as Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ region; and in Jimma, Oromia region. Trhas*, a 33-year-old Tigrayan woman who was deported from Saudi Arabia in December 2020, told HRW that Ethiopian federal police stopped her at a checkpoint at Awash Sebat, Afar, and put her on a bus to what she describes as a “military camp” in Shone. “We asked the federal police for food and water and the toilet, but we were beaten if we left our seats,” she said, describing the 36-hour bus ride to the camp. “They said, ‘Bandits don’t need food.’” In 2021, the Guardian exposed Saudi Arabia’s mass mistreatment of undocumented African migrants, exacerbated by the pandemic, at al-Shumaisi detention centre near Jeddah. Detainees interviewed at the time said they were subjected to a litany of abuses including insufficient food and water, unsanitary conditions, denial of medical care, and extortion by the centre’s guards. Nearly all interviewees said that Saudi authorities had arrested and detained them because of their irregular immigration status, but that the authorities did not provide legal justifications for their detention, nor allow them access to a lawyer or to challenge their detention. Prolonged detention without access to judicial review violates international law. Saudi Arabia is not party to the United Nations’ Convention on Refugees, and has long drawn international criticism for not having an asylum system. “Saudi Arabia should stop contributing to this abuse by ending the forced return of Tigrayans to Ethiopia and allowing them to seek asylum or resettlement in third countries,” said Hardman. A conflict in the Tigray region, in Northern Ethiopia, between Ethiopian federal government and allied forces and those affiliated with the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) began in November 2020. Since then, rights groups and the media have documented numerous abuses including massacres, mass displacement, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and blocking of humanitarian relief. The Saudi Arabian government’s Centre for International Communication and the Ethiopian government’s Communication Service did not respond to requests for comment. *Names in the HRW report have been changed to protect the identity of those interviewed.

1/6/2022,"1636: Edward Colston is born into a merchant family in Bristol. In 1680 he becomes becomes a leading shareholder in the Royal African Company, which has a monopoly in the trade in slaves. He dies in 1721, having donated some £70,000 – equivalent to millions in today’s money – to Bristol, helping to establish a number of the city’s oldest institutions. 1895: A statue of Colston is erected in Bristol “by popular subscription”. A plaque attached to its plinth says: “Erected by the citizens of Bristol as a memorial to one of the most virtuous and wise sons of their city.” Attempts to raise money for the memorial from Bristolians are largely unsuccessful and the monument ends up being financed by the wealthy Bristol publisher James William Arrowsmith.  1921: Rev H J Wilkins publishes a short book based on archival research that acknowledges Colston as a slave trader. Wilkins is the first in the modern era to question the image built around Colston and to ask if such veneration was appropriate for a man who traded in human beings. 1973: In response to historical silence surrounding the 600th anniversary of Bristol as a city and county, Derek Robinson writes A Shocking History of Bristol, exposing Colston as a leading financier of the slave trade and drawing attention to his continued celebration in annual rituals. May 1996: Complaints pour in after Bristol’s Festival of the Sea fails almost entirely to mention the city’s role in the slave trade, with multicultural arts groups launching a counter Anti-Festival of the Sea. Bristol trip hop band Massive Attack announce they are boycotting Colston Hall over its association with the slave trader. January 1998: The first direct action against the Colston statue takes place, with “fuck off slave trader” painted on the statue overnight in red paint. Days later a Bristol councillor, Ray Sefia, said he could understand why the statue was targeted. “It’s like having a monument to Hitler,” he told the Bristol Post. “We have to be very clear about Colston’s role in the slave trade.” September - October 2007: Protests outside Colston Hall are orchestrated by activists angry at the venue being used to host events celebrating the bicentenary of the end of the slave trade. The protests, some months after renewed calls by civil rights campaigners to rename the hall, come as a number of public debates are held re-examining Colston’s legacy. July 2018: Bristol council agrees to attach a new plaque to the Colston statue to make clear his “active role in the enslavement of over 84,000 Africans”. However, after an intervention by Bristol’s Society of Merchant Venturers, the wording of the plaque is watered down. Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, responds to the re-wording by blocking its installation. October 2018: Bristol MP Thangham Debbonaire calls for the removal of the statue of Edward Colston. Days later an art installation made up of concrete figures depicting enslaved Africans packed into a slave-ship appears in front of the statue of Colston. 25 May 2020: A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneels on the neck of George Floyd, an African American man, for eight minutes and 40 seconds until Floyd is dead. The murder, which is captured on video, sparks worldwide anti-racist protests under the banner of Black Lives Matter. 7 June 2020: The statue of Colston is pulled from its plinth, rolled to Bristol harbour and thrown into the River Avon by a crowd of thousands taking part in a Black Lives Matter protest. In the following days, Colston girls’ school removes a half-size replica of Colston’s statue, his name is removed from buildings in Bristol and his likeness taken from church stained glass windows. In London the mayor, Sadiq Khan, orders a review of statues connected with slavery in the capital. 25 January 2021: Jake Skuse, Rhian Graham, Milo Ponsford and Sage Willoughby are charged with damaging the statue and plinth “with each other and others unknown without lawful excuse”. 13 December 2021: The Colston 4 go on trial at Bristol crown court accused of criminal damage. 5 January 2022: All four defendants are cleared of criminal damage after jurors are urged by the defence to “be on the right side of history”.

1/6/2022,"The European Union’s top diplomat has pledged “full support” to Ukraine on a visit to the frontline of the country’s war with Moscow-backed separatists. Josep Borrell is the first EU high representative for foreign policy to have visited the Donbass region since war broke out nearly eight years ago.  “We are here first to reaffirm European Union’s full support to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he told journalists. “Any military aggression against Ukraine will have messy consequences and severe costs,” he said echoing recent declarations of EU leaders. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who accompanied Borrell on a helicopter trip to the Luhansk region, hailed the visit as historic. It was, he said, a “sign of Ukraine-EU unity in the face of elevated Russian threats”. Borrell visited Stanytsia Luhanska, a village and crossing point on the frontline that has endured years of shelling in the conflict with Russian-backed separatists. Tensions have escalated as tens of thousands of Russian troops have massed along the border with Ukraine. “The conflict on the borders is on the verge of getting deeper and tensions have been building up with regard to European security as a whole,” Borrell said. The EU has been searching for a role in the conflict before a series of crucial meetings next week aiming to reduce the temperature between Moscow and the west. Officials from Russia and the US will gather in Geneva next Monday, followed by a Nato-Russia council two days later, with talks then moving to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Meanwhile Germany and France have stepped up their own diplomacy: Berlin is sending German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s foreign policy adviser, Jens Plötner, to Moscow, while Paris is dispatching his French counterpart, Emmanuel Bonne. France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, called for close cooperation among Europeans in relations with Russia. “A demanding dialogue with Russia on the basis of parameters that we judge conform to our collective security interests is useful and necessary to reinforce strategic stability in Europe,” he said in a statement issued on Wednesday. Le Drian is due to host EU foreign ministers in Brest next week for further talks on how to handle relations with Moscow. Earlier this year France and Germany provoked fury among other EU members, by calling for a summit with Vladimir Putin. Poland and the Baltic states rejected the idea, arguing it would not change the Russian president’s behaviour. Instead the EU agreed to explore further economic sanctions against Russia, but a paper on that subject drawn up by EU officials is yet to see the light of day. Despite Ukraine’s pleas for preventative sanctions, EU officials oppose revealing any possible actions against Russia, fearing it could deepen tensions. Discussing sanctions would also be likely to exacerbate divisions among EU member states on how to respond to Russia. The Europe and US blame Moscow for provoking a crisis by massing tens of thousands of troop at the border with Ukraine and have threatened “massive consequences” if Russia invades. The Kremlin has called for guarantees that Ukraine will never be a Nato member and says the alliance should remove troops and weapons from EU member states bordering Russia, demands dismissed as unacceptable by European leaders.",News/World news,Top EU diplomat offers full support to Ukraine on visit to conflict frontline,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/top-eu-diplomat-offers-full-support-to-ukraine-on-visit-to-conflict-frontline

1/6/2022,"As long as they live in Bristol, the three men and a woman cleared this week of toppling the statue of Edward Colston may never have to buy their own drinks again. Jake Skuse, 33, Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, played key roles in tearing the statue of the 17th-century slave trader from its city centre plinth, dragging it to Bristol harbour and throwing it in the River Avon.  On the first day of their trial last month, hundreds of supporters applauded the “Colston Four”, as they have come to be known, as they arrived at Bristol crown court. On Tuesday they were found not guilty of damaging the statue, bringing their chapter in the saga to a close. But their actions, considered to be one of the most significant and symbolic acts of public dissent in Britain this century, sent shock waves that are still being felt nationally and globally. The toppling of Colston – which came just two weeks after the murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, sparked antiracist protests around the world – exploded like a cultural hand grenade. It catalysed a nationwide reassessment of the symbols of Britain’s imperialist past. Within six months nearly 70 tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists were removed across the UK, a Guardian tally found, as conversations intensified over which historical figures were appropriate for public veneration. Reverberations were felt as far away as the US where, at the funeral of Floyd himself, Rev Al Sharpton referenced the protest as symbolic of changing attitudes to race, saying: “I’ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters statue; over in England they put it in the river.” And it triggered outrage on the right. Dozens of so-called “statue defender” protests across the UK culminated in a chaotic rally by football fans around the statue of Winston Churchill in Trafalgar Square. Impassioned commentators compared protesters to a “woke Taliban” and warned of efforts to erase British history. “We cannot now try to edit or censor our past,” the prime minister tweeted. But as much as it was a trigger for a broader debate, the toppling of Colston’s statue was also the culmination of a uniquely Bristolian story. Erected in 1895, 174 years after Colston’s death, the bronze likeness celebrated a man regarded by some as the city’s philanthropic patron saint. He had given his name to three schools in the city and half a dozen roads, and a number of Bristol’s most ancient institutions owed their existence to his largesse. Every year celebrations were held in Bristol cathedral in Colston’s name. Leading pupils from the schools that bore his name were taken on pilgrimages to see a clump of his hair and his nails preserved like relics in the city’s Merchants Hall. A plaque attached to the plinth on which Colston’s statue stood celebrated him as “one of the most virtuous and wise sons” of Bristol. But concerns had long been raised over his presence. Looming over the heart of south-west England’s most multicultural city, Colston had served as a potent reminder that its wealth was raised off the backs of enslaved people. Giving expert evidence in the trial, the historian David Olusoga described how Colston had made his fortune as shareholder, and eventual head, of Britain’s most-important slave-owning enterprise, the Royal African Company. During his tenure, it kidnapped and enslaved an estimated 85,000 Africans, including 12,000 children. “For me, it was symbolic of power and lack of respect, and the position of black people as a community,” Ros Martin, a playwright and activist for many years with the Countering Colston campaign, told the Guardian. She said she felt the trial was an “appalling injustice” but that she felt buoyed up by “the fact that [the defendants] are four young white people feeling empathy and showing empathy and getting people to think”. “It’s moving beyond being a bystander, which is required from all of us,” Martin said. Throughout the 10-day trial, the public gallery was packed with locals, many of whom cheered videos shown in court of the moment Colston fell. Martin was there, and other supporters and friends of the defendants. But others, such as Douglas Peden, a local lawyer, and his two daughters, had come to watch history play out in the courtroom. “It’s the symbolism of it,” Peden said, admitting he also supported the defendants. “It’s property and ownership up against freedom of expression.” The feeling was reflected elsewhere in Bristol. Outside a pub in Bristol city centre after court one evening Jodie Lily, from Exeter, told the Guardian she knew at least 10 people who were present when the statue was toppled. “It’s only those four because they got their faces,” she said. “That piece of shit should have been taken down.” The bare facts of the case were not in question. Giving evidence, the defendants proudly recounted the roles they played. But they denied criminal damage, arguing their acts were justified by the offence caused in Bristol by the statue. It was a high-risk legal strategy, given that support for the toppling of Colston was not universal, even in Bristol. A week after the statue was felled, a counter protest by the empty plinth drew a 300-strong crowd, including a banner reading “all lives matter”. Concerns were felt across the UK. Polling by Policy Exchange found nearly half of people opposed the way the statue was toppled, compared with a quarter in support, while YouGov found that although a slim majority supported Colston’s removal, just more than one in 10 thought it was done in the right way. Nevertheless, change has since come in the wake of Colston’s toppling. Colston Hall, Bristol’s major events venue, changed its name – finally fulfilling an undertaking first made in 2017 – to the Bristol Beacon. Colston’s name was removed from pubs, buildings and roads. The 275-year-old Colston society was disbanded and his image was removed from stained glass windows. But at the same time, culture war battle lines were drawn, and the government sensed a populist win. Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Milo have been cleared but new measures in the government’s police and crime bill will allow courts to send people found guilty of damaging a memorial to prison for 10 years. As critics have pointed out, someone caught defacing a statue could, under the proposals, be jailed for longer than someone found guilty of rape. As for Colston himself, since being fished out of the River Avon by Bristol council, his statue has found his way to the city’s M Shed museum, where it has been transformed, according to Olusoga, into “the most important artefact” of the story of Britain’s relationship with its brutal slave history. There, the statue of the old slave trader lies supine, with red paint daubed on its eyes, mouth and hands. Its coattail and staff are missing. It is surrounded by placards from the day it was pulled down and across its 17th-century robes is scrawled “BLM”.",News/World news,How Bristol came out in support of the ‘Colston Four’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/how-bristol-came-out-in-support-of-the-colston-four
1/6/2022,"Boris Johnson and Angela Rayner have clashed over energy prices and the wider cost of living in the first prime minister’s questions of the year, during which Johnson made a series of false statements to advance his arguments. Rayner, standing in for Keir Starmer after the Labour leader again tested positive for Covid, castigated Johnson over the impact of inflation and rising bills, saying the prime minister was “governing shambolically” and trying to blame others.  In response, Johnson talked up rising employment figures and government schemes to help with energy bills. He also made three incorrect statements in his comments to Rayner. The Labour deputy leader began by challenging Johnson over inflation, saying: “In October the prime minister said that fears about inflation were unfounded, but working people across the country are starting the new year facing rising bills and ballooning prices. So how did he get it so wrong?” Johnson replied: “Of course I said no such thing, because inflation is always something that we have to be careful about.” But in an interview with Sky News in October, he had said: “People have been worried about inflation for a very long time, and those fears have been unfounded.” At the end of PMQs, Rayner raised a point of order, noting this and asking if Johnson “would like to correct the record”, which he did not, instead beginning a statement on Covid. Rayner said inflation was heading towards 6%, and would badly affect people’s livelihoods and savings. She went on: “Mired in their sleaze, with a divided party, the prime minister is losing the support of his backbenchers and governing shambolically – and a Labour party ready to take over.” She added: “What will the prime minister do to get a grip of this?” Johnson replied by saying he was “delivering jobs for British people”, and said that when the Omicron variant emerged, Labour “said that we needed a roadmap to lockdown”, which would have harmed the economy. However, Labour called only for the so-called plan B suite of restrictions, such as mask use and home working, which Johnson himself imposed soon afterwards. Turning to energy prices, Rayner reiterated Labour’s demand – one shared by a number of Tory backbenchers – for VAT to be removed from fuel bills, to lower prices. “The prime minister pretends it’s not his fault,” she said. “He blames global forces. He blames the market. The prime minister has made political choices that have led us into this place. His government has failed to invest in long-term energy security.” Energy prices would be a “seismic hit” for households, Rayner said. “Can’t the prime minister see what’s happening yet again? Working families are picking up the tab for his incompetence.” Johnson responded by saying that removing VAT from fuel would be impossible if he were to “do what Labour would do, and go back into the EU”. However, Labour’s policy is not to seek re-entry to the EU. Rayner went on to say the UK was suffering because of Johnson: “Under this prime minister, the country is worse off. Prices for everyday goods are soaring out of control. Hard-earned savings will be hit, and the wages of working people won’t go as far.” Serious solutions were needed, she said, adding: “Instead, we have this prime minister and his incompetent leadership. “And every time we are faced by challenge, he denies there’s a problem. He tries to laugh it off. He looks for someone else to blame. “Can I suggest to the prime minister: it’s not about brushing your hair, it’s about brushing up on your act.”",News/Politics,PMQs: Boris Johnson and Angela Rayner clash over energy prices and inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/boris-johnson-and-angela-rayner-clash-at-pmqs-over-energy-prices-and-inflation
1/6/2022,"Official data shows the number of people getting boosted in the UK fell to just over 100,000 on Sunday, compared with highs of more than 900,000 before Christmas when on some days people were queueing for hours to get vaccinated. Asked about the slowdown, the government’s vaccine minister, Maggie Throup, said the Christmas break and public holidays were key factors. So will this week see higher numbers coming forward or are there other factors at play?  Almost 60% of over-12s have had their booster or third dose. But only half of the remaining 40% have had their second dose and it is notable that there wasn’t a dramatic uptick in the number of people coming forward for first and second doses in the pre-Christmas vaccination campaign. Since a three-month gap is needed between doses, the ceiling for boosters will remain at 80% of over-12s well into the spring. People need to wait 28 days after testing positive to be eligible for vaccination. So the huge surge in cases – 2 million were estimated to have had Covid in the week before Christmas – will have inevitably meant a large number of people postponing their booster. Figures on how many people this affected are not available. But the highest rates of Covid, with one in 15 people aged 25 to 35 estimated to be infected in England last week, also coincide with the age group that would be roughly due for their booster if they had their previous vaccinations on schedule. The general guidance, not just for Covid, is not to have a vaccination if you’re running an infection. Clinical trials automatically discount people who test positive, so there is not much evidence on exactly how the immune system responds to an infection and a booster at the same time. There aren’t any known harms associated with the combination, aside from the obvious one of putting health professionals at risk if you attend a clinic while infectious. Since infection also boosts antibody levels, there is likely to be less benefit to getting a booster at the same time. It is possible that the side-effects of a booster, on top of mild Covid symptoms, might feel a bit worse, but there is no suggestion that this would be a clinical concern. Fom 11 January in England, and from 6 January in Scotland, people who receive positive LFT results will be required to self-isolate immediately and won’t be required to take a confirmatory PCR test. In theory, all LFT results, including negative ones, are already supposed to be reported via the government’s test-and-trace system and feed into daily case numbers. In practice, a much smaller proportion of LFT results are reported compared with PCR results, which are automatically entered into the system when processed in the laboratory. However, cases are already running far above the numbers being confirmed by PCR testing and the UK is already relying on other methods, such as the Office for National Statistics Infection Survey, to assess levels of prevalence.",News/Society,Will the UK’s Covid booster campaign pick up speed in January?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/will-the-uks-covid-booster-campaign-pick-up-speed-in-january
1/6/2022,"The pleasure of watching a streak of positive habits accumulating on a whiteboard has become almost a dependency for me. So much so, I debated packing it in my suitcase for a short trip away. But the humble whiteboard has a more portable, sophisticated upgrade: the guided journal. A few years ago I thought the trajectory of these workbooks – designed to probe or organise different facets of your behaviour or health – had probably peaked.  Back then, deluxe hardbacks lined the shelves of stylish stationery chains (Kikki K favoured own-brand pastel numbers: Happy, Thrive, Dream Life), while Urban Outfitters displayed quirky titles (Moon Journal, My Adorable Cat) from the lineage of Keri Smith’s 2007 Wreck This Journal in the gift section, alongside moustache mugs and line-drawn temporary tattoos. But the upswing is far from over, and the scope has become ever broader. There are journals designed to delve deeply into hobbies, or straighten out specific personality kinks. Some favour style over substance – expensive hardbacks with minimal prompts – while others offer a wealth of theory between exercises. Bianca Jafari is a product development executive at Thames and Hudson, focusing on gift products: puzzles, stationery, games and, in the pipeline, guided journals. She says journals are no longer just the domain of niche or self-help publishers. The bigger publishing houses are basing journals on their bestsellers, such as Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Journal (HarperCollins) and Michelle Obama’s Becoming: A Guided Journal for Discovering Your Voice (Penguin). “Producing a guided journal is a no-brainer because they can use content that they already have,” says Jafari. “For example, the Michelle Obama journal is a big win for Penguin because they already own the images. They’ve already got data that says that the content is a bestseller. There’s already an audience that exists.” That’s all well and good for the publishers, but can guided journals really live past the punter’s first flush of good intentions, or are they destined to be abandoned as quickly as a teenage girl sets aside the diary she received for Christmas, into which she poured her New Year resolutions? I decided to try a few. “Some journals are interest-based to help you practise a craft, like astrology, or manage your veganism or gardening,” says Jafari. Since none of those are areas of concern for me, I unearthed some that are applicable to many of us as a new year begins. Collective Hub, from Australian publisher Lisa Messenger, puts out books and journals aimed at entrepreneurs. Know Your Numbers is one such product – a chunky hardback that works hard for the money with budget templates, saving tips, start-up launch advice and income tracking tables. Several publishers offer journals dedicated to going alcohol-free, including Sober As F*** (based on Sarah Ordo’s memoir); the 90-day journal Dear Alcohol, I’m Breaking Up With You and the Alcohol Experiment Journal, based on the bestselling book This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. I tried the Declutter Challenge (Mango Publishing) by Cassandra Aarssen, which suggests you “Namast’ay home this weekend and declutter some junk”. Cynics will say this paperback isn’t helping by adding to your hoarding, but Aarssen does actually invite you to bin it, on the final (120th) page. Her “30 quick steps” to organising your home draw on mindfulness, visualisation and gratitude. As a way to avoid the long-overdue pruning of my garden hedges, I list “six awesome things about decluttering my home” and draw the things in my lounge-room that make me the happiest in the cartoon picture frames provided. I do chuck some things from the drawers into a box in the car port, but a few days later it’s Christmas Day and I receive a whole variety of future landfill. Then the Declutter Challenge joins the teetering pile of journals on my desk, presumably for ever. The line between habit-tracking books, such as bullet journals (which focus on to-do lists, logging completed tasks, and the steps towards achieving various-sized goals) and guided journals has blurred to near indistinction. “Many people associate habit trackers with the new year and downloading a few apps and promising to drink more water,” says Jafari. She believes that they are satisfying, but that commitment to a guided journal is “more special”. “You can sit with it over enough time to block everything else out … and you pour yourself into it.” One such hybrid is the Australian creation The Resilience Agenda, a “mental fitness diary” that provides strategies for achieving said fitness; though your main task is to identify each day’s three top priorities to help you reach your goals. James Clear’s bestselling Atomic Habits has been turned into the Clear Habit Journal; while Adelaide United’s football club captain Stefan Mauk has created the Inner Game, to help athletes with goal monitoring and preparation. I tried out Mindset. Reset, from Perth-based finance professional turned life coach Alisa Pettit. Promising to focus on “the non-fluff emotional stuff”, she’s delivered a generous amount of theory among the exercises. There’s still plenty of scribbling to do, and I find this the most productive journal yet. I look at the hierarchy of 10 areas of my life and find I’m tanking on “spirituality” and “community”. I’m encouraged to analyse how blame, justification and lack of responsibility have so far scuppered my goals. Then there’s the goal-setting itself. Pettit has designed three contracts that you can stick to the mirror, based on your short-term, middle-term and long-term goals. Mine are choreographing a pole-dance routine by February; developing an open mic comedy set in three months and entering a bodybuilding competition within 12 months. Serendipitously, I see they could all feed into one another. Finally, there are the journals that go for the jugular, either suggesting urgent reflection is needed – such as with Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad – or tackling tough topics, such as Grief, A Guided Journal by Australian marriage celebrant Jo Betz, written after she lost her husband, and Susan Buniva’s Successful Co-Parenting with a Toxic Ex. “These are quite different to the self-help journals, because they’re quite intrusive,” says Jafari. “Like the Judgement Detox Journal [by Gabrielle Bernstein], which asks, ‘Why do I feel the need to judge, and what happened in my own life that makes me confident to judge someone else?’” I tried Cheaper Than Therapy (Running Press), to which no author is credited, unless you include the nods to Freud and Jung. Inside are Rorschach inkblot tests, dream analysis, word association tests and methods to actualise your worst self, and 120 prompts, hopping from the distant past, to the past week, to your general psyche. As the foreword says, none of this is to be taken “super-seriously”. I decide this journal might be a good vehicle to tackle my pornography use (very healthy or very unhealthy, depending on how you look at it), via prompts such as “Do you feel worthy of scorn? Why or why not?” and “What’s your sexual fantasy? OK. Now tell me the real one? What do you think that means?” as well as the quiz “How psychosexual are you?” (“Do you ever pee yourself a little?” “Do you relentlessly chew gum?”). The answers are enlightening but, obviously, are to remain as closely guarded as my search engine results.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Messy? Unproductive? Need to dismantle your privilege?

1/6/2022,"It’s healthy, tasty and easy to make. With split pulses or lentils as its main ingredient, dal is a good source of protein, fibre and iron, making it the comfort food you can enjoy freely without feeling disgusting afterwards. I first discovered dal during an extended camping trip in the Northern Territory in 40C heat. As the main storage option was the boot of the car, that narrowed down the meal options somewhat.  A two-step dal mix that could be heated up on the camp stove in minutes soon became the star dish on a menu that otherwise consisted of two-minute noodles, pasta and jar sauce and bland tinned soup. And back in the city, with the many options that refrigeration and a fully fledged kitchen affords, dal remains a staple. An everyday dish across India, there are seemingly endless varieties to try (many of which are vegan), from refreshing tomato or light coconut-based dals to rich dal makhani (which means butter in Hindi). Plus you can easily adapt it and add whatever veggies need using up. Many don’t require the dal to be soaked first and can be cooked in under 30 minutes. If you’re less of a guts than me and have leftovers, I hear it lasts well in the freezer too. I suggest finding one or two that work for you and sticking with them. That way you can skip having to choose a recipe and write a list before you go shopping and cook it, as it’s somewhere in that process that I usually replace one of those steps with “get takeaway”. My go-to recipe is Meera Sodha’s quick coconut dal in her book East. She came up with it shortly after having a baby when she was “still a little broken and exhausted”: so, you know, manageable for those of us with regular energy levels but who are less advanced in the kitchen. The yellow soupy goodness topped with a zingy tomato sambal is very satisfying. And if that’s too tricky, grab the pre-prepared packet dal next time you go to the supermarket.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: a simple dal recipe adds a dash of healthy, comfort food to your diet ",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/06/easy-wins-find-a-dal-recipe-you-love-and-reap-the-rewards
1/6/2022,"Addressing children’s mental health is “more complex” than blaming social media and requires investment in social housing and supports through schools, the children’s commissioner has said. Anne Hollonds spoke to Guardian Australia in a wide-ranging interview about Australian governments’ responses to Covid-19, and a suite of new measures at the federal level to tackle bullying online.  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has made the affect of social media on youth mental health a focus in the lead-up to the 2022 election, campaigning on online safety and arguing reforms are needed, particularly to prevent harassment of women and girls. Hollonds said she “absolutely” supports the legislation to unmask anonymous social media trolls, the social media inquiry and regime of eSafety commissioner content takedown orders as measures that put “the best interest of children as the first priority” in the “unregulated” digital world. But Hollonds warned that a decade-long increase in mental health problems including self-harm, which predates the Covid-19 pandemic, has other social and economic dimensions. “There are some people who might like to say ‘oh it’s all the fault of social media’. “That’s often the go-to answer as to why kids have mental health problems. I wouldn’t deny it has an effect but it’s not as simple as that, it’s more complex.” Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data shows in any given year 20% of Australians experience mental ill health and that, even before the pandemic, three-quarters of Australians with mental ill health were under 25. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One in four Australian teens reported experiencing psychological distress in 2020 and parents have warned that the pandemic and lockdowns have made it harder to find help. Hollonds said poor youth mental health is a “long-term increasing trend” which Covid has “opened our eyes to in a way we can’t ignore” due to a “spike where there were extended lockdowns”. “It’s something that obviously worries me hugely … you just have to ask how bad does it have to get before we recognise that we need to make children a national policy priority?” In addition to the way living in a digital world has “changed the experience of childhood”, Hollonds nominates the financial pressure from the cost of housing and inadequate support systems as causes. “For example the education system … for the kids who are struggling, perhaps the old style education system where it’s just about academic learning is not really doing enough for kids,” she said. “I think Covid has shown schools are about much more than academic learning that can be replaced by zoom. “By closing schools we actually added pressure to the distress of kids.” One of the main lessons from the pandemic is that schools “should be the last to close and the first to reopen, because of their importance in the overall wellbeing of children”, Hollonds said. “In my view … we’ve under-estimated school as a community hub of support for the wellbeing of kids and their families.” Hollonds said that some other developed countries had better integrated the health and education systems making it “easier for people to get help they need”. Hollonds said the cost of housing and the “spike in costs during Covid” was also a deeply worrying factor that emerges from her consultation with children, young people and their families. “It’s those areas with low incomes, higher poverty and disadvantage … outside CBDs, in rural and outer urban areas – [they are] precisely the areas where rents have become unaffordable [during the pandemic].” Hollonds called on governments to address “under-investment in social housing over decades” and to look at economic drivers of housing costs. Her comments back calls from other experts for more comprehensive mental health supports and higher income supports to tackle the youth mental health crisis. In November the former Labor premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill, who’s now chief executive of Minderoo Foundation’s Thrive by Five initiative, accused the Morrison government of neglecting to assess the affect of the pandemic on young children, with current policies labelled “a series of crisis responses”. The latest Naplan data has found that Australian schoolchildren’s basic literacy and numeracy skills were relatively unscathed during first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, but gaps are widening between city students and those in regional and remote areas. Guardian Australia previously reported concerns from teachers that the compounded effects of two years of intermittent learning in some areas are only just beginning to become apparent, especially for younger cohorts (up to grade 2) that are not captured by the Naplan dataset.",News/Society,"Youth mental health: Australia needs to look beyond ills of social media to fix crisis, children’s commissioner says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/youth-mental-health-australia-needs-to-look-beyond-ills-of-social-media-to-fix-crisis-childrens-commissioner-says
1/6/2022,"I love the ocean but in the last two years, I haven’t seen her much. Now the world’s gotten a little bigger, all I want to do is be by the water. Sup – or standup paddleboarding – is the closest you can get without actually getting wet. You cruise along, admire the view, find a nice spot for lunch.  You can dip in, dip out – hell, you can take a rod if you want, or do some downward dog on your board. Humans have been supping a long time – records go back to as early as 3,000BC, but the modern iteration was born in Hawaii in the 1940s, when surfer John Ah Choy could no longer get up and down on his board. He started to use a paddle to help him get out to the waves, his kids picked it up, and like many water-related activities that come from that island, it spread quickly across the globe. Paddleboarding is now a common feature in most Australian waterways. It’s often cited as the fastest growing water sport – and when you do it, you can tell why. For starters, you can learn almost instantly. You just hop on the board and when your balance is right, if you feel comfortable, you stand up. Simple. Nic Cooper has been supping for years now. He loves it so much he’s made it his job – taking travellers around Victoria to the best spots. “I’m hardcore into it. But I’m not I’m not one of those that goes on, like, marathon Sups or anything like that. I just love being out in the ocean and just chilling,” he says. “I see it as relaxation.” Cooper says he’s never had a student who couldn’t do it – some stay on their knees, but given you’re cruising past turtles, dolphins and kangaroos, it’s still a good time. “Depending on your balance and stuff like that, you can get pretty good at it within a few hours,” he says. Egalitarian in its demands, Cooper says all ages and most body types can Sup. “I think it’s made water sports accessible for everyone.” Once you’ve got the basics, you need to finesse your technique to get the most out of each stroke. While this isn’t essential for beginners, it’s a must to compete in a race, or to Sup your way along a river for a few days. This requires “bending your knees as you go forward and … leaning down on your paddle … to get the most propulsion as possible,” Cooper says. “Even giving your paddle a little twist as it exits at the back will have less push on the water and therefore it’ll be a more efficient stroke.” More advanced Sup-ers can even ride them like surfboards. Before we set out for a lesson on Melbourne’s waterways, Cooper’s best advice was “never look back”. Which of course, I forgot when a turtle swam under me. I swivelled around and went very quickly from standing up paddleboarding to falling down paddleboarding. But I stayed dry, and luckily out of the frame of our fast-moving photographer. Despite the tumble, a sense of calm prevailed – it is like valium in a water sport. As we drifted on the ocean just off Mt Martha beach, shadowed by peninsula “shacks” that would cost a cool $2m, I asked whether the sport was as egalitarian in price as it is in skill. How much does it cost to sit on a board for a hit of bliss regularly? Not much, or quite a lot, says Cooper. The cheapest, easiest way for those who want to try it is to book a Sup session or hire a board at the beach. Depending on where you are, board hire can be about $30 for 60 minutes. If you want a lesson to make sure you’ve got the basics – or to mine your guide for the best spots – it’ll cost about $60 for an hour. As for buying your own gear, it depends what you want to do with it. “If they want to go on these huge trips – 20, 30km along the coastline or whatever – then they’re going to want a long, thin touring board,” Cooper says. For activities like yoga, he suggests something wide and stable. The cheapest Sup I could find online was a blow-up one going for $200 – without a pump. Price differences from there are about quality, ease, and weight – the more expensive boards blow up quicker, last longer and are substantially lighter, Cooper says. He warns to avoid the cheapest new boards “because it’s just going to break”. A high quality board new will cost about $900, but secondhand options are the best way to score a bargain. Supping isn’t a solo sport, either. Aficionados can join their local clubs and even plan holidays around the activity. “You can take them in a backpack so you could go to some really awesome places … Once you’re confident and you know you’re not going to fall off, then you can go anywhere really.” This piece was supported by Visit Victoria and Wild Adventures Melbourne.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘You can learn almost instantly’: a beginner’s guide to standup paddleboarding ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/06/you-can-learn-almost-instantly-a-beginners-guide-to-standup-paddleboarding
1/6/2022,"A south-west Sydney nursing home is battling a major Covid outbreak with families now questioning the timing of booster shots and why positive cases were kept in close quarters with uninfected residents. One fully vaccinated resident who was receiving palliative care has died, and 63 more have tested positive to Covid at the Bupa aged care home at Clemton Park – 38 residents and 25 care staff – a sharp rise since the facility activated its outbreak management plan on 21 December after a staff member tested positive.  Bupa closed the 144-bed facility to all visitors at this point, however cases have steadily risen, and have since spread between the home’s separate “communities” on different floors of the complex. On Tuesday, families of residents were notified by email that a resident receiving palliative care, who had contracted Covid, had died. Residents had been scheduled to receive their Covid-19 booster doses on 10 January, after having received their initial two doses in April and May. Management has now brought forward booster vaccinations for residents, with 31 of the 140 residents receiving the dose on Tuesday and others scheduled for this Friday. Dimitrios Kapeleris is furious at how Bupa has cared for his father, Theofanis, who has tested positive. After first learning of the Covid outbreak, Dimitrios pleaded with management to evacuate all Covid positive patients from the facility, to “avert a disaster of the likes of Newmarch House and St Basil’s”. He was worried about his father’s wellbeing and chance of surviving Covid. He was also concerned about the potential for aerosol transmission within the facility when doors were opened by staff. In Facetime video calls with his father during the outbreak, Dimitrios claims he could see staff leave the door to his room open for several minutes as they came in to clean up. The 84-year-old suffers diabetes and has advanced dementia, and his son had already taken the precaution of taking his father to a private clinic to get his booster shot in early December (before the outbreak began), unsatisfied with the idea of leaving it until January when the rest of the home would receive it. Dimitrios claimed his request to separate positive cases was turned down. He is also critical of how Bupa communicated news about the outbreak to families. “They’re in damage control, it’s all about PR … Only now after complaining are they holding a meeting with the families and sending regular emails and, but they’re still leaving out details,” he said. “I was trying to prevent my dad from getting infected. And lo and behold, he got infected. “He’s holding up OK. But he’s scared, and I’m concerned if he deteriorates. I’m just hoping he pulls through.” Staff are checking in on Covid positive residents twice daily, but Dimitrios said that should be more frequent and he wanted his father to be moved to a hospital or other care facility. “This is going to be an unmitigated disaster,” he said. At a crisis meeting with families held on Wednesday afternoon, several families raised concerns about the psychological state of their parents with dementia. A spokesperson for Bupa confirmed that staff were checking in on positive patients twice daily, and said that most residents were “clinically stable with only mild symptoms”. “In order to keep relatives abreast of the situation, text messages and email updates are being sent on a daily basis,” they said. The spokesperson added: “The health and safety of our residents and team members is paramount so we acted quickly to control any potential spread of Covid-19. This included closing the home to all visitors, using rapid antigen tests on all residents and members, full PPE for team members including face shields, and a deep cleaning of the home.” They also said the facility is “cohorting our team members to single communities”, and that additional agency staff have been brought in. Additionally, the spokesperson said that residents were “remaining within their own communities within the home to minimise movement in the building with team members dedicated to each community so they don’t work in other areas”. Of the 140 residents in the facility, 118 are double vaccinated. When asked why booster doses were scheduled more than six months after residents had received their second dose, the Bupa spokesperson referred Guardian Australia to the commonwealth health department, noting it was the body responsible for the aged care vaccine rollout. A department of health spokesperson said that commonwealth vaccine providers have been asked to schedule a visit for all eligible residential aged care facilities by the end of January, and that it had so far contacted all facilities to schedule booster shots. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Scheduling and timing is managed between vaccine providers and facilities to ensure clinics are held at a time suitable to the facility and their residents – there has been a focus on booster clinics where there is a higher risk of outbreaks due to community transmission.” “Booster clinics are being delivered by commonwealth vaccine providers, primary care providers and, where eligible, facilities can self-manage an onsite clinic,” the department spokesperson said. Dimitrios said he believed the policy of keeping residents in their own quarters had failed. “We had been advised that they were sealed off from each other. Then how did my dad get it when the first case was in another community (section)?” Dimitrios said his father was “one of the few” who had had a booster dose, and that family of other residents who were unboosted remain concerned. “They are petrified,” he said.",News/Australia news,Covid outbreak at Sydney nursing home leaves residents ‘petrified’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/covid-outbreak-at-sydney-nursing-home-leaves-residents-petrified
1/6/2022,"For Phil Johnson, the licensee of Aireys Pub, keeping the hotel open seven days a week at what should be peak season has instead become a “day-by-day proposition”. During summer the hotel’s lawn, which boasts spectacular views of the sea and sunset, is usually packed with holidaymakers who have flocked to the Victorian surf coast town of Aireys Inlet to escape Melbourne’s heat.  But this year the pub’s takings are on target to be down by about 20% over summer due to a combination of staff being unable to work because they fear they have Covid and people staying away because they don’t want to catch it. The pub is among businesses grappling with a staff shortage crisis gripping hospitality and tourism operations from Victoria to Queensland, as skyrocketing Covid cases caused by the Omicron wave and a shortage of testing keeps workers away from their jobs. Johnson said the hotel had also struggled to find staff in the run-up to Christmas because two normal sources of labour – backpackers and cooks who come from overseas on skilled migration visas – were unavailable due to the pandemic. “We have 40, 45 staff over this peak period,” he said. “At the moment I’ve probably got about 10 with Covid or suspected Covid, which is making life really hard.” He said workers have been unable to confirm whether they have it because of the long waits for PCR tests at the nearest site, about 30km away in the Geelong suburb of Torquay, and the unavailability of rapid antigen tests. “A few people have had like one or two, but I was in Geelong this morning, just going through Chemist Warehouse, but I can’t find any,” he said. “Our kitchen’s good, which is good, so it’s just the front of house that we’re struggling with. It’s just a day-by-day proposition at the moment.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some customers are also staying away, even though Aireys Inlet appears to be as full of people as usual – no short-term rentals are available in the town this week, according to booking website stayz.com. “We are not as busy as we thought we’d be because a lot of people are being cautious,” Johnson said. “It seems like a few families down here got it, so they’re staying away. And a lot of the oldies who we’d normally see just aren’t coming because I think they’re obviously, rightly, concerned.” He said the fall in business so far was “not great, but not the end of the world”. “If we come to a grinding halt next week, then we’re going to be in a whole lot of pain, but touch wood we’ll just keep going.” Staff shortages have hit tourism and hospitality operators across Victoria and the country, with reports of restaurants shut in nearby Lorne. On the other side of the bay, Hotel Sorrento, which services millionaire’s playground the Mornington Peninsula, closed suddenly on New Year’s Eve “due to health & safety reasons”, operators said on social media. It will reopen from midday on Friday, the hotel said on Tuesday. Up north, the luxury Intercontinental resort on Hayman Island, in Queensland’s Whitsunday islands, has cancelled tourist bookings because staff are in isolation, while the restaurant industry in holiday hotspot the Gold Coast has reportedly ground to a halt. Staff shortages have also hit domestic travel, with flight numbers at less than 80% of what was seen in January 2019, before the pandemic hit, according to data compiled by rating agency Fitch. “It’s very dramatic, staff shortages that are really starting to bite now,” Daniel Gschwind, the chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, said. He said the sector had suffered from a lack of labour even before the pandemic, with cooks, chefs and hotel managers in short supply, although the Queensland industry brought more than 30,000 people back to work last year. “The reality is we’re still short of what we need now,” he said. “It is now made worse because with Omicron spreading, which we anticipated, it is taking staff out of jobs. “That has actually now led a number of operators to operate at reduced hours or just close completely because they haven’t got enough staff.” He said difficulties getting PCR tests were making the situation worse. “Getting a test is a challenge and getting the result is a further problem because it’s not as if they arrive in 24 hours any more, it takes days,” he said. “We wanted the borders to open and we knew we had to take that step but it makes it so much harder.” He said two years of international borders being closed had also cut off the flow of working holiday visa holders, international students and skilled visa holders on which the industry had relied. “People have all kinds of views about that but the reality is that the Australian economy was fuelled by thousands of international workers,” he said.

The industry relied too much on casual workers, Lord said. “It’s time hospitality jobs were well paid, secure and reliable jobs that workers can count on,” she said. “It’s terrible that many hospitality venues are having to shut their doors due to rising case numbers and staff shortages, but it’s also terrible that so many workers in hospitality have never had access to paid leave when they’re sick or need to care for loved ones, let alone know how many hours they will work week to week.”",News/Australia news,‘We’re struggling’: Covid surge spoils summer for Australia’s hospitality and tourism businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/were-struggling-covid-surge-spoils-summer-for-australias-hospitality-and-tourism-businesses
1/6/2022,"Importers of already-approved Covid rapid tests say they are being frustrated by long regulatory delays blocking them from selling the devices for home use, further strangling supply at a time of peak demand. The Morrison government has faced sustained criticism over its failure to shore up supplies of Covid rapid tests ahead of the current Omicron wave, including by companies critical of the slow regulatory approval process.  Currently, Australia’s health regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, needs to separately approve the same rapid Covid test for use in two different settings: at home through self-testing, or at various points of care under the supervision of a health practitioner of staff member. Approvals for home tests were slow to commence and are still lagging badly behind. Just 18 tests have been approved for home use, while 65 tests have been approved for use in care settings. Suppliers who already have approval to supply rapid tests in point of care settings are facing months-long delays to obtain the regulator’s green light to sell the same devices for self-testing, despite the fact they have already been deemed safe and reliable, and generally only require a tweaking of packaging and instructions. One importer said they had been waiting three months for the TGA to examine the instructions included in the box of their already-approved rapid test, to ensure they were suitable for home use. “That is a source of frustration for many importers,” he said. “You would think that maybe if the TGA was to say to us ‘this is what your insert has to say’, we would say exactly that and away we go.” “But in the meantime we are communicating backwards and forwards and have been doing so for some time.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning An analysis of registers published by the TGA shows 26 suppliers of rapid antigen or lateral flow tests are currently approved to sell tests for use in point of care settings, but not for home use. Not all of those 26 suppliers have applied for approval to sell their tests for home use and some rapid tests require the use of special instruments, not available in a home setting, to properly obtain a result. The TGA said it is prioritising the assessment of self-tests, but suggested delays were often caused by applicants. “For most applications received by the TGA, there is missing information that requires additional submissions from suppliers which in turn, extends the finalisation of the regulatory review and approval process until the information is submitted and then assessed,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson said self-tests must comply with minimum standards, including performance criteria and information on labelling and instructions for use that can be easily understood by consumers. In cases where approval for point of care tests already existed, suppliers wanting to sell the same test for home use must provide additional information and change instructions for use to enable self-testing, the spokesperson said. Instructions written for health professionals contained assumed levels of knowledge that were “not suitable for consumers or lay-persons”, the TGA said. The supplier is also required to show how they would provide support for self-testing, including, for example, through instructional YouTube videos. Suppliers must also provide usability testing by untrained, unsupervised users. “The TGA’s assessment process ensures that Australians can be confident that the tests they are using are safe, perform as intended, with the relevant steps and support provided to consumers who purchase them.” One test distributor said the approval process for an at-home Covid test had taken several months, despite the TGA having previously approved another supplier to sell identical tests for home use. “It’s just so difficult and it’s taken far too long,” the distributor said. They said tests cost about AUD$3.50 out of China, plus freight, warehousing and distribution costs. National cabinet agreed on a plan late Wednesday evening to give disadvantaged people small cash payments to cover the cost. The agreement will provide up to 10 rapid antigen tests free to more than six million concession card-holders, but everyone else who is not a close contact of a case and symptomatic will still have to pay. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, dismissed growing calls for universal free access to rapid testing kits, at odds with Labor leader Anthony Albanese, who on Wednesday called for rapid tests to be made freely available. “We have considered the options and it is clear that this is the simplest, most efficient, fairest and most responsible way to fix the mess that Scott Morrison has made of testing at this critical juncture of the pandemic,” Albanese said.",News/Australia news,Rapid antigen test importers say ‘frustrating’ regulatory delays are holding up kits for at-home use,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/rapid-antigen-test-importers-say-frustrating-regulatory-delays-are-holding-up-kits-for-at-home-use
1/6/2022,"One of New South Wales’ major regional hospitals had to source its own triage tent, is sending Covid tests six hours away due to a lack of space for its own diagnosis machine, and has had positive patients wait 30 hours to be transferred to a designated hospital for those with the virus. Doctors at the Tweed hospital, which is 1km from the Queensland border in northern NSW and serves a hinterland that includes Byron Bay, are even donning personal protective equipment to drive home, in their own cars, asymptomatic Covid-positive patients because taxis won’t take them.  Kristin Ryan-Agnew, president of the local branch of the Nurses and Midwives Association and a senior nurse at the hospital, said local Covid cases were tripling daily, much faster than the 5o% growth in new cases reported for NSW as a whole on Wednesday. As a result of increased presentations to Tweed’s emergency department, nurses were doing “double shifts every day” with one day off before resuming the toil. “They’re going to fall over in a screaming heap,” she said. “They will not be able to manage.” Eighteen staff, many of them senior, have resigned since December out of a roster of about 150, citing burn-out and the better conditions offered over the border. Queensland offers $1,800 a year for nurses’ education, a Covid bonus – both absent in NSW – and higher wages, Ryan-Agnew said. “They were really top-notch, really good quality staff, and they can walk up to the Gold Coast and they’ll just completely snaffle them.” As Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday, nurses at Lismore Base hospital – the destination for Tweed’s Covid patients needing treatment – are also struggling to cope with a surge in medical needs. The Tweed hospital is buckling under spiking demand for care and a lack of trained staff and appropriate equipment. A senior manager, for instance, had to phone around themselves and then purchase the triage tent prior to Christmas after months of pleading to the health department, Ryan-Agnew said. The tent, though, remains far from adequate, with no toilet, forcing potentially Covid-positive patients – and anyone waiting for PCR testing to cross the border – to traipse through the main hospital lobby. “You can have people with heart conditions, sick kids, elderly, frail, all sitting there waiting to be seen, and you’ve got a potential Covid patient walking through the waiting room,” Ryan-Agnew said. Patients with chest and severe abdominal pain, septic children and adults should be in beds not a tent without nursing care, staff said. Earlier this week, one Covid patient had to wait 17 hours before being transferred to Lismore, while another patient had to wait 30 hours before being moved on Wednesday. The nurse manager shares office space and air-conditioning with two beds set aside for Covid patients with no air-locked space for changing PPE. “We have bottles of hand sanitiser sitting on top of overflowing bins, flapping Covid tent flaps compromising PPE,” another staff member, who requested anonymity, said. “We also continue to struggle getting adequate PPE and supplies, certain masks run out, no hair coverings and no disposable blood pressure cuffs.” A Northern NSW Local Health District spokesperson said a “transportable treatment area” had been set up to treat Covid-positive patients without serious illness so they didn’t need to enter the hospital. “As with any month in a large organisation there has been some staff turnover, however, this is not different [from] other months or years,” the spokesperson said. “These positions have been filled with new staff, casual staff, and any potential shortages can also be filled with staff between wards and facilities. “Our workforce across northern NSW has been increased and upskilled, with more than 265 staff attending surge training in intensive care, emergency care and immunisation specialties to provide additional capacity if needed. “We regularly review our stocks and supply chains of resources, including PPE and pharmacy items, to ensure adequate supplies.” According to Ryan-Agnew, some of Tweed’s problems were partly self-inflicted. Pathology North, the department’s regional pathology unit, offered to supply Tweed with a BD MAX machine used to conduct Covid tests on the spot. That would save sending the results three times a day for what can be a six-hour journey. “We just needed the scientists to use it because you have to have doctors to be able to read the results,” Ryan-Agnew said, but the hospital management refused to set aside space to house it. “We still don’t have the BD MAX. That’s been argued for months and months and months.” Do you know more about pressure in the healthcare system? Contact peter.hannam@theguardian.com.
