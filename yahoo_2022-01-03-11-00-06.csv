1/3/2022,"As of Sunday, Texas recorded over 10,000 new COVID-19 cases. Gov. Greg Abbott said he asked for federal support to testing sites on Friday. This comes after Abbott worked to block vaccine mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has long been opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates as well as other preventive measures, said that his state has requested federal help for testing sites. ""Detecting COVID-19 and preventing COVID-related hospitalizations are critical to our fight against this virus,"" Abbott said. In a press release on Friday, Abbott said the state requested ""resources for federally-supported testing locations and medical personnel and additional federal allocations of monoclonal antibodies."" Abbott said he requested support for testing sites in Bexar, Cameron, Dallas, Harris, Hidalgo, and Tarrant counties because of their high positivity rates and hospitalization. Bexar, Dallas, Harris, and Tarrant counties are in the top 25 of all US counties for COVID-19 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus resource center. According to state data, there were 10,892 new cases across Texas as of Sunday. As of December 29, the state had a 26.49% test positivity rate, and over 5,500 COVID-19 hospitalizations. Abbott also said the state requested additional medical personnel for urban areas as well as supplies of several monoclonal antibody treatments. Last week, the Texas Department of State Health Services announced the state had run out of sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody effective against the Omicron variant. In a tweet, Abbott criticized President Joe Biden for not fulfilling a pledge to support states with their COVID-19 response and accused him of ""hoarding the anti-body therapeutic drugs & denying states independent access to that medical treatment."" In his press release, Abbot said: ""While the Biden administration has cut supplies of monoclonal antibody treatments and testing kits when they are needed most, the State of Texas is urging the federal government to step up in this fight and provide the resources necessary to help protect Texans."" Back in October, Abbott issued an executive order that barred any Texas entity, including private businesses, from issuing COVID-19 vaccine mandates. That ban came after Biden announced plans to require private businesses with more than 100 employees to require COVID-19 vaccination or weekly testing. ""In yet another instance of federal government overreach, the Biden Administration is now bullying many private entities into imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, causing workforce disruptions that threaten Texas's continued recovery from the COVID-19 disaster,"" Abbott said in the order at the time. Additionally, on Friday, a federal judge ruled to halt Biden's mask and vaccine mandate as conditions for funding for Head Start programs, KVUE reported. Following the ruling Abbot said': ""Texas just beat Biden again."" Insider was unable to reach Abbott's office at the time of publication.

1/3/2022,"A video has emerged in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, showing a clerk at a local convenience store beating a customer as he suffers a seizure. Now, the community is outraged as the victim has been hospitalized and days later cannot move his whole body. On Dec. 22 at the Princess Market convenience store around 3:30 p.m. on West Raleigh Boulevard after a 56-year-old Black man entered the store. Gregory Evans, according to his family, started having a seizure when the clerk left his post behind the counter to confront him. It was then that the person started to beat Evans with a stick despite the man experiencing a medical crisis. The violent assault was captured on cellphones by other customers. WRAL, a local NBC affiliate, assisted in the investigation of the assault by providing authorities with video copies of the incident they had already acquired. Sobhi Hassan, 68, was arrested by Rocky Mount Police Department earlier on Tuesday, Dec. 28, and was charged with simple assault in connection with the incident. The video shows Hassan shouting at Evans, “Get out now,” before coming over to beat him six times on his leg during his seizure. As a result of the altercation, Evans is hospitalized and undergoing tests. The incident has prompted acts of civil unrest calling for justice for Evans. Protestors cleaned up trash, as they collect signatures for a petition to get the store shut down, claiming that the store has a history of treating customers “in a negative and discriminatory way.” Local authorities are continuing to investigate the assault to determine if it can be considered a hate crime. His sister, Edith Cooper, gave an update on his condition at the Ebenezer Baptist Church on Monday, Dec. 27, during a forum organized by civil rights activist the Rev. Thomas Walker. The goal was to give voice to the community and to hear the progress of the investigation from the police. She informed the community, “He’s a little slow … and he still doesn’t have full mobility of his body at this time.” She also noted that her brother said that his back and legs are “hurting.” Police Chief Robert Hassell asked the community in a forum on the investigation, which lasted for approximately an hour and 20 minutes, to be patient as they gather information. “Once that is complete, then we will take the appropriate action and move this case forward,” Hassell said. “Give the police department and our District Attorney’s Office a chance to do what we are hired to do.” He continued, “I only ask the community: Please remain calm and let the police department conclude this investigation — and we will take the necessary actions that needs to be taken, in lockstep with our District Attorney’s Office, to make sure that we have a solid case if there is one to be brought.” He shared that they have more information on the assault, including additional videos. Hassell further noted that he was unable to speak with Evans because of his health. During the gathering at Rev. Walker’s church, Cooper said that her brother could not strike Hassan back after he was hit because of the seizure. She said that her brother grabbed the counter involuntarily as he experienced the shakes and convulsion of the seizure. Cooper further explained that witnesses took him outside of the store and alerted an ambulance of the trauma. According to the sister, at first paramedics treated him exclusively for the seizure before being made aware that he had been beaten.
