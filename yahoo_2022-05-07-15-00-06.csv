5/7/2022,"Abortion is certainly no laughing matter, which makes it a delicate dance for a topical comedian to broach. Bill Maher worked both sides of the street on Friday night’s Real Time on HBO, starting with a few quips and then embarking on a serious discussion on the ultra-sensitive issue. Starting with a riff on Cinco de Mayo – “If you can’t remember what you did last night, you might want to get an abortion now” – Maher noted several states with ultra-restrictive laws. “Suddenly, getting the right pronoun doesn’t seem so big.” More from Deadline Bill Maher Claims Twitter Has Failed In A 'Real Time' Take On The Big Elon Musk Sale Bill Maher And Bob Odenkirk Talk About God And Comedy In HBO's 'Real Time' Session NBC Sets Full 'Sunday Night Football' Announcing Team, Including Michele Tafoya's Replacement On the bright side, those in states with draconian abortion laws can use the car pool lane if driving to another territory, Maher said. The panel discussion featured Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Paul Begala and former NBC sports reporter and guest co-host for The View,” Michele Tafoya. “People hate talking about abortion, so let’s talk about it,” said Maher to kick things off. “Is this going to be the galvanizing issue the left thinks it will?” Begala said the apparent demise of Roe v. Wade would take the nation back to 1931, and pointed out that Texas and Michigan have laws that offer no exceptions for rape or incest. “They want to punish and control.: Tafoya said she was pro-choice, but said, “There’s gotta be a point at which we say, ‘This is a human being capable of living outside the womb.” She brought up a colleague who works in the maternity ward of a hospital and saw five-month old premies who survived to be 20-year-olds. “Why would you extinguish that life?” Maher noted that abortion “didn’t used to be a partisan issue until it became an issue for the Christian right.” Tafoya noted the advent of sonograms may have raised temperatures, before Maher delivered his own views. “It really comes down to, ‘Do you like women, or do you like babies?’ I never thought life itself was particularly precious. I really don’t. I’m serious. I think life is for the living. Until you’re born you’re not living. We wouldn’t miss you if you’re not born.” He allowed, “I get that’s not most people’s position. Begala noted that most people support three positions on abortion: “Rape, incest and if my daughter gets in trouble.” Invoking the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Tafoya said that the former Justice thought Roe v. Wade was not constructed right. “I do think there is some middle ground.” Wrapping up with New Rules, Maher said that looking after you and keeping you safe is not Twitter’s job. “It’s your job,” he said, noting how some people feel that the social media audience is “All helpless dumb blondes ready to believe anything. Like Donald Trump.” He ran down a list of technological innovations that prompted fears in the past. “Lies can spread faster, but so can truth. This idea that we can clean up Twitter and protect you, it’s ridiculous. It’s like fact-checking graffiti on a dive bar bathroom wall.” Every age is the misinformation age, Maher asserted, and suggested, “Develop a better bullshit detector. That’s a better solution than me giving up what I’m allowed to read.” Sometimes, Maher said, misinformation is just history’s first draft. “This is America,” he said, laughing when an American flag waved to back him. “Where people have the right to express what they thin, including the right to be wrong, to lie, and to be an asshole.” Opening guest Chloe Maxmin, former Maine State Senator and coauthor of Dirt Road Revival: How to Rebuild Rural Politics and Why Our Future Depends On It, called for a new effort to address the needs of rural Americans through dialogue.

5/7/2022,"Travel industry leaders are hopeful the Biden administration will finally end a major COVID-era hassle for Americans traveling abroad and for international travelers who want to visit the United States: A negative COVID test within 24 hours of boarding a U.S.-bound flight. That requirement has been in effect since late last year, when the Biden administration ended a ban on travel into the United States from a variety of countries and replaced it with the negative-test requirement. At first, the rule said travelers could show a negative test within 72 hours of their departure time, but that was tightened to 24 hours. While it’s a worry for Americans traveling abroad, who might get stuck overseas while recovering from COVID, it’s a bigger barrier for foreigners who want to come to the United States: Booking a trip means risking a wrecked itinerary if a positive COVID test prevents them from even arriving. The skies may soon brighten. “We are optimistic this requirement will be lifted by summer, so we can get the benefit of all the international in-bound travelers,” Christine Duffy, chair of the U.S. Travel Association and president of Carnival Cruise Lines, told Yahoo Finance at the recent Milken Institute annual conference in Beverly Hills. “The Commerce Dept. has been working closely with the travel industry and the administration is aware of the issue.” [Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or send in your thoughts.] More than 250 travel-related organizations, including Delta, United, American and Southwest airlines and the Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Omni and Choice hotel chains, sent a letter to the White House on May 5 asking the government ""to expeditiously terminate the inbound testing requirement for vaccinated air travelers."" The letter pointed out that Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and other countries no longer test incoming passengers for Covid, and that many American workers are returning to normal routines—so why not international travel? The travel industry may have suffered more than any other industry from COVID lockdowns, exposure fears and rules meant to keep travelers safe. That includes billions of dollars in lost business from foreign travelers who aren't coming. The U.S. Travel Association says overseas travel to the United States in 2021 was 77% below 2019 levels. Those figures don’t include Canada and Mexico, though inbound travel from those neighboring countries plunged as well. Overall, those declines add up to about $160 billion in lost revenue annually. Anecdotal evidence suggests the pre-departure testing requirement imposed last year heavily influences travel decisions. Industry officials say that during the winter, for instance, Caribbean bookings for U.S. travelers were much stronger in places such as the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico where Americans don’t need a pre-departure test to return home, than in similar locales where a test is required. ""When those restrictions came in place, all those international islands, the Caymans, Antigua, they didn't get any travelers,"" Richard Stockton, CEO of Braemer Hotels & Resorts, said at the Milken Conference. ""They got concentrated into Key West, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands. Those resorts went through the roof while the others suffered."" There are also inconsistencies in the testing policy. People traveling to the U.S. from Mexico or Canada by land don’t need to show a negative COVID test, for example, while air travelers do. Travel industry officials say Commerce Sec. Gina Raimondo—whose job is to advocate for American businesses—is pushing for an end to the testing rule. But Biden administration COVID policy is driven by the White House, where Ashish Jha recently replaced Jeff Zients as the national COVID response coordinator. Jha, presumably, would need to sign off on the withdrawal of the COVID testing rule, with Biden’s approval. So far, he hasn't. Jha faces other pressing matters. The Biden administration suffered a stinging rebuke in April when a federal judge struck down the federal masking requirement on airplanes and mass transit systems. The Justice Dept. is appealing that ruling, though it seems more interested in protecting federal powers in future emergencies than in reinstating the mask rule. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, still recommends travelers mask up on airplanes and mass transit. Jha may feel the Covid testing rule for inbound travelers is now a necessary offset to the protection lost from the end of the mask mandate. The counterargument is that the end of the masking requirement makes the COVID testing requirement for inbound travelers outdated. Roughly 2 million people per day now fly domestically without a mask requirement, while the number of international travelers who must pass a COVID test is about one-tenth as many. Vaccines and boosters, meanwhile, have slashed the odds of serious illness for those who get COVID. “There’s no reason for a pre-departure testing requirement,” says Tori Barnes, executive vice president for public affairs and policy as the U.S. Travel Association. “We need to be globally competitive as a country. All other countries moving toward an endemic stage.” The Biden administration seems to be lurching in that direction. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said on April 26 that the United States was “out of the pandemic phase.” But a day later, he modified that characterization, saying the U.S. is out of the “acute component” of the pandemic stage. Maybe by summer, he'll be willing to say the pandemic is irrevocably over.
