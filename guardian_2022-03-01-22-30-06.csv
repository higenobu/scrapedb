3/1/2022,"Earlier this month, Steve Bladon, a father of four, watched with some unease as the prime minister announced the lifting of all Covid restrictions in England. After two years of the pandemic – the lockdowns, the legal requirements to self-isolate, the social distancing and mandatory masks – the message from government was that it may not be over, but it’s time to learn to live with Covid. As the headteacher of a primary school in a small town in Lincolnshire, Bladon, 46, knows as much as anyone about living with the virus. He has led his team and school community tirelessly through the pandemic, delivering remote education and food parcels, reassuring anxious parents and keeping colleagues calm. It’s been exhausting but rewarding, and he’s proud of what his school has achieved. Now, however, he’s one of as many as 1.3 million people in the UK learning to live with long Covid – that’s an altogether different challenge. “My life has changed profoundly,” he wrote in a recent blog. “I now feel fatigued and exhausted almost all of the time. I have no energy, like someone has removed my batteries. On the worst days of the last few months, I’ve been sitting or lying down worrying about breathing. Breathing is life itself. When you’re struggling to breathe, everything else falls into perspective.” It’s a far cry from the fit, energetic man Bladon was not so long ago. Long Covid has affected him in all sorts of unexpected ways. When the Guardian interviewed him last week, he warned he sometimes loses track mid-sentence and forgets words. It’s something that’s happened since he contracted the virus. “It’s like being in somebody else’s body,” he says. “I wake up in the morning and whereas I would normally jump up at once and go running before work, now I don’t sleep very well. When I wake up I feel exhausted. It’s like having no energy, no fuel, no batteries. There’s nothing there. “I get up, I feel lousy. As a matter of pride I think oh, I’ll hoover the front room, I’ll put the breakfast things away. But if I do anything I feel shattered. I’ve gone from being non-stop to having to think about every step. When you get in this situation you realise how much work means to you and how big a part of your life it is.” Bladon, whose children are aged from five to 13, has been teaching for 23 years. He’s been a headteacher for 11 of those, the last four and a half years at Horncastle primary school in Lincolnshire. “Headship is always a challenge,” he says, “but the last couple of years have been so turbulent and unpredictable, and difficult to navigate at times because there was no precedent. It’s been a bit like being entered into an endurance event but with no finish line.” He remembers vividly the day the prime minister announced the nation was going into lockdown in March 2020. It seems a long time ago. “We were all just looking at each other. We didn’t know what to expect,” he says. As the first wave of the pandemic swept across the globe, Horncastle primary – like every school in the country – closed to all but the most vulnerable children and those of key workers. Everything was new. Government guidance began to arrive thick and fast, landing in inboxes day and night, weekends and holidays. Teachers learned a whole new way of teaching remotely. “We don’t have the best wifi in this part of the world,” says Bladon. “A lot of children did not have devices. But our staff responded brilliantly. They delivered food packages to families in need and helped parents access food banks when they faced hardship. For the first 18 months of the pandemic, Bladon and his school saw relatively few cases among the 500 pupils and 70 staff, but since September there have been multiple outbreaks. “In the worst week we had over 20 staff off. Parents have been worried. Staff have been worried.” There have been difficult conversations with parents, reluctant to send their children to school. There have been bereavements. Staff and pupils have been ill. “The last two years have been the hardest mentally and physically of my whole career in terms of leading a community, but equally they’ve probably been some of the most proud and rewarding of times.” Then on 9 December last year, everything changed for Bladon. As he wrote in his blog: “I’ll remember that day for some time. I’d actually forgotten to test at home that morning so I took a lateral flow test in my office as soon as I remembered. “The double lines came as a shock. I had a heavy cold but no other symptoms. I quickly gathered my things and left school, in something of a haze. December 9th was actually the last time I set foot in school. In fact, I’ve only occasionally left the house since.” Bladon had been double vaccinated but was not yet eligible for the booster when the virus struck. After the challenges and restrictions of living with Covid, he’d so been looking forward to all the traditional Christmas celebrations at school and at home. Instead, he isolated with his seven-year-old daughter (who tested positive the day after), and though he felt very unwell with an intense cold, facial pain, fatigue, tight chest and loss of smell, he was not admitted to hospital. After 10 days of isolation he emerged and tried to get back to normal life in time for Christmas. “We had a really busy week. I was feeling OK, not 100%. I thought, I’m through the worst of it. But as the days went on, I was really beginning to feel quite tired.” Some time between Christmas and the new year, he went for a run. “I’ve always been into running. I agreed to go with a mate who was coming back from injury. We ran five kilometres and stopped every kilometre. We went a bit slower than both of us normally would, but I felt quite good. Four or five days later I tried the same thing again, but running by myself, and I just felt completely dreadful.” After a kilometre he gave up and went home to bed. “My chest was hurting. I got into bed and I stayed there for pretty much 24 hours.” It was the onset of post-Covid syndrome, or long Covid, and it’s been a battle ever since. “Going from being really busy and fit to almost housebound – it’s taken a bit of getting used to,” says Bladon. “I now feel fatigued and exhausted almost all of the time,” he wrote in his blog. “If I get up from a chair too suddenly, just to go to another room, my heart rate soars. If I go upstairs or do a simple job, like emptying a bin, I lose my breath.” Following medical advice, he is taking things slowly, trying to build up his strength and stamina. Some days are bad, some are better. “I put my faith in medicine and doctors. I’m being well looked after. I’ve had good support from my GP and from my employers at the Wellspring Academy Trust. I avoid Googling anything and trust that my body is recovering. “This is a new virus. In some people it’s taking a long time to work through the body. The doctors’ opinion is that I was fit and healthy, it’s simply a matter of resting. I’m having to accept the fact that I might be in it for the long haul.” He can’t wait to get back to school, back to normal life. In the meantime, his deputy is acting as headteacher. “I regret being so ill, but it has not put me off teaching. I love working in a school. I love being with children. Making a difference is what it’s about. I think I can still do that, and that’s what I want to do, but goodness me, it’s been very, very hard.” I ask him about what he thinks now of the government’s decision to lift all Covid restrictions. “I’m not comfortable with the decision. Nothing has changed substantially to what’s happening at ground level in schools. People are becoming ill with Covid still. As I’ve found, some people get very ill.”",News/Society,‘I last went to school in December’: a headteacher’s battle with long Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/01/headteacher-battle-with-long-covid-school-lincolnshire
3/1/2022,"More than 100 members of staff at the University of Manchester have signed a letter opposing an attempt to force out the director of the Whitworth Art Gallery (Wag), calling it a “grave violation of academic and artistic freedom of expression”. The Guardian reported last week that Alistair Hudson was asked to leave his post by the university over a row regarding a statement of solidarity with Palestine’s “liberation struggle”, which was removed from an exhibition of works by the human rights investigations agency Forensic Architecture. It followed a series of complaints by UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), which advocates for Israeli causes. UKLFI told the Guardian they had “suggested that the university should take appropriate disciplinary action” against Hudson in September. Sources also said the university had explicitly cited Hudson’s response to the fallout from the exhibition as reason for his alleged ousting. In a new statement shared with the Guardian, staff across the university, as well as members of Forensic Architecture, said they were “gravely concerned and outraged at the attempt to force out” Hudson. “We demand that he be reinstated and an apology issued by the UoM to this grave violation of academic and artistic freedom of expression,” they said. The statement said it was “damaging and dangerous” that the university “supported the idea that a statement against Israel’s war crimes against the Palestinian people was an act of antisemitism, and forced its removal. “Forcing out the Wag director six months after the event is therefore not only punitive, but also shows that the UoM will not support and defend its staff when and if under pressure from outside organisations.” The controversy dates from August, when a statement was removed from the exhibition exploring how pollution, chemical attacks and the aftermath of explosions affect marginalised people in places around the world, including Palestine. The letter added: “After demonstrations from staff and students (including over 13,000 letters of support for Forensic Architecture sent to the UoM senior management team) the solidarity statement was reinstated, but a counter-statement was exhibited alongside it.” A protest against the university’s action against Hudson “and their censoring of support for Palestine” is expected to take place at Whitworth Hall on Tuesday. In Tuesday’s open letter, university staff demanded “that the UoM reinstate Alistair Hudson and apologise to WAG, the wider UoM staff, and UoM students for this grave violation of the principle of academic and artistic freedom. We also extend our solidarity to the Palestinian people for the right to live with freedom and in dignity.” One of the organisers of the letter told the Guardian the letter had received “such a large endorsement” within days. They called the alleged move to oust Hudson a “chilling precedent” that they said risked damaging the prospects for politically engaged research “and further marginalising Palestinian solidarity in UK universities”. Colleagues, they said, were “also profoundly saddened that the episode threatens to seriously damage the international reputation” of the university. It comes as a group of 23 artists – including the Turner prize winners Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo – said they are pulling their work from the Manchester leg of a prestigious touring art exhibition in support of Hudson, Palestinians, political freedom and artistic expression. The University of Manchester pointed to a previous statement that said staffing matters “remain strictly internal to the university” and it would not comment on Hudson, whom it described as “our current Whitworth director”. A spokesperson added: “We would, however, like to address the explicit criticism in the coverage that the university has in some way suppressed academic and artistic freedoms, or bowed to external pressures. We refute such claims entirely. Museums and galleries have traditionally been a space of experimentation and challenge and we hope that the Whitworth is a place where we can debate, discuss and disagree well.”",News/Education,Manchester University staff sign letter in support of Whitworth gallery director,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/01/manchester-university-staff-sign-letter-alistair-hudson-whitworth-palestine
3/1/2022,"Grocery prices rose at their fastest rate in more than eight years in February, according to the market analysts Kantar, which predicted the squeeze on shoppers would continue as a result of supply-chain disruption and the conflict in Ukraine. Food price inflation hit 4.3% last month, the highest since September 2013, as the price savoury snacks, fresh beef and cat food increased the fastest. However the cost of some products, including bacon, beer, and spirits fell. Britain’s households have been grappling with a cost-of-living crisis, after the annual inflation rate hit 5.5% in January – a near 30-year high. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, economists had predicted more pain in April when household energy bills would soar. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “Apart from the start of the pandemic, when grocers cut promotional deals to maintain availability, this is the fastest rate of inflation we have recorded since September 2013. “Added to this, ongoing supply-chain pressures and the potential impact of the conflict in Ukraine are set to continue pushing up prices paid by consumers.” Higher prices and the end of Covid restrictions in England were having an impact on consumer behaviour, the data showed, as shoppers chose more own-label products than branded items for the first time in three months. Aldi and Lidl were benefiting from more visits to their stores, and were the fastest-growing retailers during the 12 weeks to 20 February. Their sales increased by 3.3%; an extra 1.3 million customers shopped at Aldi compared with 2021, while almost 1 million more people visited Lidl. Lidl’s sales boost enabled it to overtake Co-op to become the UK’s sixth-largest grocer, meaning both discounters were now among the top six supermarkets, behind Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons. Overall sales at supermarkets fell last month, and households spent on average £26.07 less at grocers, as the economy began to open up after the pandemic and consumers returned to buying more food on the go, purchasing sandwiches or snacks for their lunch break, or enjoying meals out at restaurants and cafes. As a results, shoppers were filling their trolleys with fewer items to consume at home. Despite this trend, sales at the biggest grocers were higher than before the Covid crisis. McKevitt said: “Supermarkets with a strong food-on-the-go offering will have enjoyed an added boost that is not reflected in the numbers as people picked up sandwiches, snacks and drinks while out and about again,” The return to work and socialising after Covid had led more consumers to return to supermarkets. Kantar reported that online grocery sales had fallen by 20% in February compared with a year earlier, as 835,000 fewer people bought groceries online. However bad weather, including storms Dudley and Eunice, which hit the UK in February, kept many customers away from stores, and there were almost 7m fewer shopping trips during the week ending 20 February. On 18 February, when a rare red weather warning meant people in Wales and south-west England were advised to stay at home, Kantar reported a 25% drop in footfall compared with the same day in 2021, as many schools, businesses and train stations were closed across the UK.",News/Business,"Grocery prices in UK rise at fastest rate in eight years, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/grocery-prices-uk-rise-fastest-rate-food-price-inflation-shoppers-covid-ukraine
3/1/2022,"Schools are too often reluctant to report child sexual abuse carried out by staff and pupils, and are sometimes more concerned about preserving their reputation than protecting the interests of children, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse has said. The report, which focused on abuse in residential schools in England and Wales, found that despite improvements to safeguarding over the last two decades, children continued to be sexually abused, in some cases by teachers who exploit positions of trust. While many of the cases of sexual abuse occurred years ago, the inquiry panel stressed that recent testimonies on the Everyone’s Invited website showed that for children in some schools sexual abuse and harassment between peers remained endemic. The report warned that schools were not as safe for children as they should be and schools needed to accept “it could happen here”, and in the case of peer-to-peer abuse “it probably is happening here”. The report into abuse at residential schools is the 19th produced by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA). It was set up to examine the extent to which institutions have failed to protect children in England and Wales from sexual abuse. For the investigation into residential schools, the inquiry panel examined incidents of child sexual abuse, harmful sexual behaviour between children and other safeguarding issues at 13 schools, and a further eight schools which have closed. It included residential music schools, including Chetham’s school of music in Manchester, as well as a number of residential special schools, where there have been numerous allegations of and convictions for child sexual abuse. The report, published on Tuesday, said many of the schools responded inadequately to allegations, in some cases there was a culture which actively discouraged reporting, and too often headteachers found it “inconceivable” their staff could have committed such crimes. The inquiry chair, Prof Alexis Jay, said despite 20 years of enhanced focus on safeguarding, schools were not as safe for children as they should be. “Schools play a central role in the lives of almost 9 million children in England and half a million in Wales. They should be places of learning where children are nurtured by trusted teachers and are able to flourish in a safe environment. “This is in contrast to the many shocking instances of child sexual abuse detailed in this report. They represent the opposite of everything that a school should be. “Poor leadership frequently left staff unaware of how to respond to concerns about sexual abuse or too afraid of potential consequences to act. “In some cases, it was clear that protecting the reputation of the school was prioritised over the protection of children from sexual abuse – this is a recurring theme in very many of our reports.” The report makes a series of recommendations, including setting nationally accredited standards and levels of safeguarding training in schools and introducing a duty on boarding schools and residential schools to inform the relevant inspectorate of allegations of child sexual abuse, with regulatory consequences for breach of this duty.",News/Education,"Schools too often reluctant to report child sexual abuse, inquiry finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/01/schools-too-often-reluctant-to-report-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-finds
3/1/2022,"A planned response to Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on Tuesday night by Rashida Tlaib, a progressive Democrat from Michigan, highlighted a rift in the party. The president will speak to Congress and the nation from the Capitol. The Republican rebuttal will be delivered by Kim Reynolds, governor of Iowa. Tlaib will also respond, for the Working Families party. It will not be the only Democratic response: Collin Alred of Texas will speak for the Congressional Black Caucus. One moderate Democrat, Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, said Tlaib’s decision to speak was “like keying your own car and slashing your own tires”. Tlaib said: “Despite some sensational coverage, it’s simple: I’m giving a speech about supporting President Biden and his Build Back Better agenda for the people.” Build Back Better, valued at $1.75tn and meant to boost health and social care and address the climate crisis, passed the House with moderate support. But it stalled in the Senate, opposed by Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Biden’s State of the Union address will be overshadowed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But he is expected to reframe his domestic ambitions. Tlaib will highlight the cost of not passing Build Back Better. The Working Families party was formed in 1998 by unions and other groups. It aims to “build our own party on top of the two-party system in the United States”, sometimes running candidates in Democratic primaries, seeking to build “the multiracial movement we need to win the America we deserve”. On Monday, Maurice Mitchell, the party’s national director, said: “Obstructionist Republicans and a handful of corporate Democrats have ground Washington to a standstill while child poverty spikes and costs continue to rise for housing, healthcare and childcare. “It doesn’t have to be this way.” Gottheimer played a prominent role in negotiations over Build Back Better and Biden’s $1.2tn infrastructure plan, which passed with Republican support. He told Axios Tlaib’s speech would be “massively counterproductive”. He added: “This only highlights the real tension between the socialist far left and the common-sense moderate wing, which is focused on crime, costs, tax cuts and affordability and turning the page on Covid.” Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said it was “astonishing” that the “radical left continues to promote a Democratic death wish, and sees no problem relegating our party to the permanent minority”. Tlaib said Americans should “look past the headlines and hear progressives’ vision for working with the president and Congress to deliver for our residents”. Biden will deliver his first State of the Union with his approval rating at new lows and with Republicans favoured to re-take the House in November.",News/US news,‘Keying your own car’: Democrat hits out at Tlaib for State of the Union response,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/rashida-tlaib-biden-state-union-response-democrats-gottheimer
3/1/2022,"For teenager Janice Mitchell, hearing the Beatles’ I Want to Hold Your Hand on US radio in December 1963 affected her in ways she still can’t quite articulate. “How do you explain why [you were] electrified when you were struck by lightning?” she says, laughing. I Want to Hold Your Hand didn’t just sound more interesting than the other songs in rotation on her home town station, the single represented an escape from a difficult childhood. Mitchell, of Cleveland, Ohio, grew up with neglectful parents who eventually abandoned her and two younger siblings. And 1963 had been another hard year. Mitchell was reeling from the death of a beloved great uncle, one of the few adults who had shown her kindness. The arrival of the Beatles provided a glimmer of hope. “I realised I wanted to go to where the Beatles were from, because I figured that’s where happiness would lie,” Mitchell says. “That was my goal: to go there and breathe Beatles air, walk on sacred Beatles soil and have a happy life.” Mitchell made good on her wish, as she recounted in her riveting book My Ticket to Ride: How I Ran Away to England to Meet the Beatles and Got Rock and Roll Banned in Cleveland. She and another resourceful friend successfully left the US and spent a blissful three weeks in England in autumn 1964, enjoying London nightlife and the sights and even visiting Liverpool – though, unfortunately, they did not cross paths with any of the Beatles. My Ticket to Ride is far from the only Beatles book released last year. Most notably, Paul McCartney’s bestselling The Lyrics: 1956 to the Present arrived weeks after The Beatles: Get Back, a companion piece to Peter Jackson’s epic-length documentary. But Mitchell’s memoir is one of the few Beatles books written by a woman in the 60 years since they released their debut single. The Beatles have profoundly shaped and enriched the lives of women, but the literature, journalism and critical scholarship – with a few notable exceptions – tends to focus disproportionately on how men experience and appreciate the band and its music. “For a generation X woman coming up in the 1990s, the odds of placing a Beatles-related story or interview at a major publication felt like 100-1,” says music journalist Kristi York Wooten. Yet in recent years more scholars, journalists, musicians and podcasters are challenging conventional Beatles narratives and expanding who gets to lead conversations around the band. To Wooten, this shift is long overdue. “Media coverage of the band’s evolution has depicted women as bystanders, rendering our stories of the music’s impact inferior or merely tied to fandom.” Ardent Beatles fandom isn’t always viewed in a positive light, despite how vital it was to the band’s success. As critic Sasha Geffen writes in Glitter Up the Dark: How Pop Music Broke the Binary: “Without Beatles girls, there’s no Beatles. Each group forged its identity in relation to the other.” Yet the narrow stereotype of a Beatles fan that crystallised during the 1960s – think a teenage girl screaming over the band because they’re so cute – lingers. “Female scholars who are also fans of the Beatles still run the risk of being perceived as more of fan than as an authoritative voice,” says Dr Christine Feldman-Barrett, a senior lecturer in sociology at Griffith University and author of last year’s A Women’s History of the Beatles. “The legacy of the ‘hysterical’ female Beatles fan is such that it has, I believe, made a good amount of women reluctant to write about the Beatles until more recently.” Feldman-Barrett’s book is a comprehensive corrective to outdated modes of thinking. It delves into lesser-covered topics ripe for analysis (such as how the Beatles influenced female musicians) and takes a fresh look at Beatlemania, the women of the Beatles’ universe and fan relationships with the band. The book grew out of Feldman-Barrett’s lifelong appreciation for a band that opened her eyes to other subjects, such as “British history, the interest in eastern spirituality in the 1960s”, she says. “It’s really been a portal into different interests.” As Geffen writes: “A girl could invest her desire in the band, but she could also discover herself there.” Decades later, the Beatles’ ability to spark curiosity persists across generations. Growing up in the UK, musician and author Stephanie Phillips was struck by the Beatles’ cultural omnipresence. “As a young person who wanted to develop my own sense of self, it almost felt overwhelming,” she says. Coming to the band’s music in her 20s via noisier covers by American bands such as Pixies and Throwing Muses “gave the Beatles this alternative sheen and almost made them sound like an obscure underground cult band,” she says. Such sonic leeway shaped the music Phillips makes in the punk band Big Joanie – she references both the White Album’s “experimental song structures” and the taut songcraft of the Beatles’ “earlier, pop-centric albums” – and helped her cement a different perception of the band. “My version of the Beatles wrote short and snappy love songs, experimented with every genre possible and was clear about the cultures they were influenced by,” she says. “It is in my mind a more expansive and inclusive version of the Beatles than the band that I grew up hearing on the TV as a kid.” Dr Holly Tessler vividly recalls hearing news reports on John Lennon’s 1980 murder, although she didn’t know who the musician was at the time. “Being the dorky kid I was, rather than listening to the music, I decided it was going to be a research project,” she says. The 10-year-old borrowed Nicholas Schaffner’s The Boys from Liverpool from the library and spent the next few weeks reading (and re-reading) the book, “boring all of my friends and family” by peppering them with Beatles facts. “After what must have been an interminable amount of time, my parents just said: ‘Here, kid, listen to music.’ And there was no going back.” Tessler’s subsequent insatiable interest in all aspects of the Beatles led her into academia and founding the University of Liverpool masters program The Beatles: Music Industry and Heritage. Launched in September 2021, it offers a rigorous study of the band’s cultural, media and economic impact. Tessler says the class is diverse, spanning new graduates to mature students in their 60s. “I was a little bit concerned that there would be a big division,” she says. “They’ve all sort of bonded now. And everybody’s a happy little group of Beatles students together.” The younger generations of Beatles fans who came to the band long after their breakup are even less beholden to rigid historical narratives surrounding the group, says Tessler. “[They’re] much more plugged into debates around gender and sexualities than earlier generations would have been.” It’s a conversation that has been broadened by the podcast world. “I see more young fans wanting to move away from the ‘who do we blame for the breakup’ approach, and more towards an approach that analyses everyone’s individual experiences, emotions, and points of view,” says Thalia Reynolds, who co-hosts Another Kind of Mind: A Different Kind of Beatles Podcast with Daphne Mitchell and Phoebe Lorde. The show operates as a collective of voices presenting thoroughly researched episodes (sample: “Jealous Guy: Lennon-McCartney and Competitive Admiration”). “We thought it was past time the Beatles were discussed with empathy and humanity,” says Lorde. “That means making the effort to see things from every perspective.” The podcast’s co-hosts say the Beatles have shaped their lives in numerous ways: influencing them to perform, write and develop an appreciation for music; deepen friendships; and even find solace in discussions about topics such as John Lennon’s sexuality. “The Beatles’ music, their story, their selves are uniquely comforting,” says Mitchell. It isn’t necessarily a given that multiple generations of Beatles fans will get along. Allison Boron grew up a fan of the Monkees and Beatles. As a teenager, she eventually found kindred spirits in the latter’s nascent, circa-Y2K online community. “I can’t imagine who I would be without the Beatles,” she says. “It sounds crazy sometimes when I hear myself say that, but there’s really no way they haven’t impacted my life.” One early job working for a local Beatles tribute band piqued her interest in the music industry, where she works today. In 2018, she launched the podcast BC the Beatles. Boron recalls how she and co-host Erika White received plenty of encouragement from older fans. But they also experienced ageism, sexism and fandom gatekeeping. “We were bumping up against people who didn’t think we had a place at the table because we weren’t there originally,” she says. “We were having a hard time getting taken seriously.” Empathy for the unfairly maligned Yoko Ono inspired the launch of All About the Girl, a Liverpool-based podcast. “All my life I had heard all sorts about her, that she was some kind of talentless destructive force, or a joke,” says co-host Chloe Walls. “Only when I started to do my own research did I grasp the total disservice done to her by the mainstream narrative.” Walls came to love Ono’s music while researching the Beatles after seeing the 2019 movie Yesterday; she was “irritated” by how the film “fundamentally misunderstood what made the Beatles great.” Several podcasters interviewed mentioned Beatles fan fiction and fan art as an influence on their fandom – and especially that of younger generations. For Walls, the Beatles’ online fandom was also formative in that it “allowed me to be creative in a space with other likeminded people” and also introduced her to her partner (and podcast co-host) Daisy Cooper. The pair met in 2020 on Tumblr, “in a discussion about the relationship between John and Paul,” Walls says. As an adult, My Ticket to Ride author Mitchell worked as a journalist and a private investigator. While writing her book, she used those skills to try to figure out aspects of her painful childhood. She discovered greater empathy for her younger self – as well as perspective on how hearing I Want to Hold Your Hand altered the trajectory of her life. “If I had never heard the Beatles at that time, my life would have been completely different.”  My Ticket to Ride: How I Ran Away to England to Meet the Beatles and Got Rock and Roll Banned in Cleveland by Janice Mitchell is published by Gray & Company.",Arts/Music,"‘It’s a more expansive, inclusive version’: how women reshaped the history of the Beatles",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/01/its-a-more-expansive-inclusive-version-how-women-reshaped-the-history-of-the-beatles
3/1/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. It’s difficult to sit down and concentrate at the moment, isn’t it. Whenever something worrying and momentous is occurring in the news, most things feel frivolous and pointless. I used to experience an amorphous sense of guilt around writing about video games for a living when important and harrowing things were happening in the wider world. I work at a newspaper replete with talented people doing difficult and vital journalism about the geopolitical events that affect us all. Should we not be reading that, instead of something about Elden Ring? It was the pandemic that finally convinced me that games, like all art and culture, are vital when things are terrible – they provide not just a distraction, but also respite. When we are overwhelmed, we need something that helps us feel more grounded, in control. When we are heartbroken, we seek out songs and novels and poems (and, yes, games) that reflect our feelings back at us, or give us space to process them. During 2020, video games were actively helping people – to socialise, to unwind, to cope with the near-unbearable stress of living through Significant Historic Events. I saw (and reported on) the positive effects that they were having on people, some of whom were totally new to games. Sometimes it can be difficult to find the joy in the real world. That is why we create fictional ones. I think that in times of crisis, games are not just a useful escape from our feelings, but a way to process them. I was really struck by these lines from the closing paragraph of Simon Parkin’s beautiful Elden Ring review last week: “Video games can be all kinds of different things, representing all manner of artistic ambitions. Most, however, share a common goal: to conjure a compelling fictional reality, filled with beckoning mysteries, enchanting secrets, and enriching opportunities to compete and collaborate. They aim to provide a liminal space in which a determined player can fix that which is broken, order that which is chaotic … Its final gift is the assurance that, whatever monsters lurk in a broken world, with perseverance and cooperation, they too can be overcome.” That urge to fix things – to take action, to make things better – is something that video games can satisfy for us, even when there is little we can usefully do to help in the real world. This is why, perhaps, they can be such a powerful mental salve, and why we so often turn to them when things feel broken. Here, at least – on my Animal Crossing island, or in the Lands Between, or on my Civ map, I can experience a sense of calm, of joy, of victory, and bring some order to the world. I have never seen a more affecting interactive portrayal of the effects of conflict on ordinary people than This War of Mine, from Polish studio 11 Bit, inspired by the siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s. Instead of a squad of soldiers, you take control of ordinary people searching for food, shelter, medicine and safety in an occupied country, trying to avoid danger and get by until a ceasefire is declared. You must manage not only their physical needs, but also their emotional state, which takes a dreadful battering with each new misfortune.

The game that immediately came to mind was Watch Dogs: Legion, an innovative and lovably imperfect action-thriller about a near-future London that has become a technocratic surveillance state. In this game’s fiction, Brexit was a disaster, Scotland seceded from the UK, and corporate and military interests have seized total control over government, providing two very good illustrations of why Scottish independence might be a good idea in the first place. Unfortunately there is barely a mention of Scotland in the game’s actual script (to my knowledge, and I played a lot of it), so we don’t know how it’s going north of the border in this fictional future.

3/1/2022,"As many people do when discussing the complex world of cryptocurrencies, Vladimir Putin kept it simple: “Of course, we also have certain competitive advantages here, especially in the so-called mining.” After events this weekend, when Russia was hit by severe financial sanctions, the Russian president might be considering capitalising on those advantages. Putin was speaking in January, days after the country’s central bank proposed a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining. In the case of bitcoin, the cornerstone cryptocurrency, mining is the energy-intensive process by which computers verify new bitcoin transactions – putting them on a virtual ledger known as a blockchain – and generate new bitcoins as a reward for that work. The Bank of Russia was emphatic in its warning, saying that cryptocurrency mining entailed “significant risks for the economy and financial stability.”. One week later, Putin appeared to be less sure, pointing that Russia had advantages in cryptocurrency mining due to its huge energy wealth and expertise in the field. Putin’s doubts about a full crypto-embargo might well have deepened after the west applied massive pressure to Russia’s financial system with new sanctions. The EU, US, UK and Canada have targeted the country’s $640bn (£478bn) in foreign currency reserves – a financial buffer held as a back-up to deal with emergencies and provide financial stability – by agreeing to “prevent the Russian central bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions”. The same group have also announced that unnamed Russian banks will be expelled from Swift, the main global payments messaging system used by banks to make cross-border money transfers. Russia and its banks could be looking at cryptocurrencies more closely because they could represent an alternative medium of international exchange to the dollar. Cryptocurrencies could also bypass the international banking system that is key to enforcing sanctions as a listening post for financial transactions worldwide (a characteristic of cryptocurrencies that watchdogs and central banks dislike), by offering an alternative way to make irreversible cross-border transactions. “We’re at a watershed moment in global history where central banks of nation-states are no longer in direct control of the financial instruments once used to impose global regulations. With cryptocurrency in its infancy, these decentralised currencies lack the agency and infrastructure needed for the ability to regulate institutions as large as Russia,” says Eric Michaud, co-founder of Off The Chain, a blockchain security conference. Other crypto experts argue, however, that the transparent nature of blockchains makes it difficult for sanctioned entities to use cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions. Nonetheless, some nation states have turned to bitcoin for an escape. Iran, heavily sanctioned by the US but with substantial fossil-fuel reserves, effectively converts its excess energy into cash by acquiring bitcoins off Iran-based bitcoin miners (powered by fossil-fuel generated electricity) and using the currency to buy imports. “The Iranian state is … effectively selling its energy reserves on the global markets, using the Bitcoin mining process to bypass trade embargoes,” said Elliptic, a blockchain consultancy that helps clients combat crypto-related crime, in a blog post last year. Elliptic’s director of policy and regulatory affairs, David Carlisle, says crypto mining is “one of the most feasible options” for Russia, which is already the third-largest country for bitcoin mining according to data from the University of Cambridge. “In addition to actually minting crypto that can be used to trade with governments, Russia can tax the underlying money activity as well. They can license and tax the activity itself,” says Carlisle. Elliptic estimates that the Iranian government could make about $1bn a year from Bitcoin mining. Carlisle adds: “Once it’s in possession of large amounts of bitcoin that it’s mined, Russia can then use that Bitcoin to pay for imports of goods and services that it might otherwise struggle to access, owing to US and European restrictions.” However, the Wall Street Journal reported last week that the US is considering imposing sanctions on Russia’s cryptocurrency market. Companies such as Elliptic offer software that lets businesses spot illegal crypto transactions. According to Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, the transparent nature of blockchains makes it difficult to use cryptocurrencies as a basis for cloak-and-dagger sanctions dodging. “Sanctions evasion activity is captured on public, permanent, immutable blockchain ledgers,” says Caroline Malcolm, head of international public policy and research at Chainalysis. Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced extensive sanctions against Russian businesses and elites following the country’s invasion of Ukraine. This has prompted many to ask Chainalysis how Russia may attempt to use cryptocurrency to evade sanctions. There remain other paths that Russian actors could use, including the North Korean route of hacking cryptocurrency platforms, which raised $400m for Kim Jong-un’s state last year alone, according to Chainalysis. There are also ransomware attacks, where criminal groups encrypt a target’s computers and demand cryptocurrency in exchange for unfreezing them, although Russia’s FSB security agency recently claimed to have dismantled the REvil ransomware group. Last year, the US treasury department sanctioned two Russian-owned cryptocurrency exchanges, SUEX OTC and Chatex, for allegedly helping launder ransomware proceeds. On Monday, crypto exchange Binance said it was blocking the accounts of any Russian clients targeted by sanctions. According to Elliptic’s Carlisle, the Russian state could use a network of exchanges to conceal crypto ownership. “If the Russian government or Russian entities wanted to look to ways to evade sanctions using crypto, they could try to develop a network of complicit exchange services that would help them do that,” he says. There are also cryptocurrencies that are difficult to trace, such as the privacy-focused Monero. But Carlisle adds that the sheer scale of the financial restrictions facing Russia is such that cryptocurrencies will not suffice. “Crypto alone will never enable Russia to circumvent financial restrictions at the scale it needs to mitigate the full impact of restrictions; Russia’s total banking sector assets are $1.4tn – nearly the size of the entire crypto market.” There are also alternatives to cryptocurrency. Ejecting Russian banks from Swift could encourage China to strengthen its own nascent payment network, Cross-Border International Payments System. Alexi Drew, a senior analyst at RAND Europe, a research institute, says: “It would not be beyond the bounds of belief that China takes the Russian line on sanctions being unfair and provide a means to alleviate them by giving Russia the use of CIPS.” Or the answer might be even closer to home. The Bank of Russia is developing its own digital rouble too.",News/Business,Could Putin be exploring cryptocurrencies to bypass western sanctions?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/could-putin-be-exploring-cryptocurrencies-to-bypass-western-sanctions-russia-ukraine-invasion
3/1/2022,"BBC Two’s new reality show Rock Till We Drop doesn’t have the most compelling of premises. A search to find new musical acts, with all the members aged 64 or over, on paper it has the uncomfortable tang of everything that has gone before it. X Factor. Britain’s Got Talent. That thing where Gene Simmons paid a cursory amount of attention to some schoolkids. These are all shows that used real people as fodder for hard-edged entertainment. Doing the same with older people would be an absurdly bad look. And yet, despite all this, Rock Till We Drop turns out to be one of the most life-affirming things I have watched in years. The series sets out to form two new bands, then train them up to perform a set at the Isle of Wight festival. Tonally, it’s a minefield. Too hard-edged and it would have been cruel. Too easy on the contestants and it would have been saccharine. Too lax with Covid protocols and it would have been a disaster. There are a thousand ways to get a show like this wrong, and only one way to get it right. Miraculously, Rock Till We Drop gets it right. As we meet each new potential band member, we’re told their history. Sometimes they have toiled away without recognition. Sometimes they will have come within a hair’s breadth of fame, only to have an unlucky break. Sometimes they will have been held back by their own lack of belief. On paper, this sounds like a cynical onion-chopping attempt. But in reality, it’s a world away from the cheap sob stories you’d see on shows such as X Factor. Here, they are stories of lives that have been lived. We see the full sweep of who these people were, to better understand who they are now. There’s a refreshing clear-headedness about it, too. The show’s two groups are mentored by Martin Kemp and Lady Leshurr, who quickly discover that this isn’t just going to be a celebration of later life. There’s an incredible amount of hard work involved and, when the groups start practising together in episode two, it quickly becomes apparent that this will be an incredible uphill battle. A particularly telling moment comes when the festival organiser warns Kemp that the band will have to be good. It’s one thing to put them on stage, quite another to predict how a drunk and sunburnt festival crowd will respond. This is a very good point. Of all the possible climaxes to a heartwarming reality show, you suspect the one people want least is a load of 80-year-olds getting pelted with bottles of urine. So reality sets in quickly. The chosen few have to learn very quickly how to work together as a band and sound cohesive. Some struggle. There are nonagenarian drummers who have to undo decades of big band style in order to learn All Right Now by Free. There are church singers who aren’t used to singing solo. There is a bassist who, for reasons we may never fully understand, keeps saying the word “twang” out loud whenever he plays a note. The frustration is palpable. One drummer, a Merseybeat veteran who plays in a wheelchair, struggles so openly with adapting to a reggae beat that it becomes hard to watch. The tension even gets to the mentors. Kemp swiftly transforms into a dehydrated husk as he attempts to keep everyone’s spirits up. Worse still, his musical director, Toby Chapman, permanently looks as if he’s on the edge of flipping out and Whiplashing an entire roomful of pensioners. But soon, something beautiful happens. As the bandmembers mesh, they start to become the stars they’ve always wanted to be. Seasoned leather-clad guitarists start to look the part. Singers find their voice. Without question, my favourite is Carol, a seventysomething music teacher who happens to be a monster on the bass. Every second she is on camera is filled with total joy and rocksteady competence. The woman is a delight. She cannot be on television enough. The world is a brighter place for having her in it. This is the spirit that fills Rock Till We Drop. There is so much heart on display that it is a pleasure to watch. It’s still early days, but this just could be the feelgood hit of the year.",Arts/Television & radio,Rock Till We Drop: a talent show for the over-64s?

3/1/2022,"A further 100,000 Ukrainians refugees will be able to come to Britain, the home secretary, Priti Patel, will announce on Tuesday, following pressure for the UK to take more of those fleeing the war in eastern Europe. The scheme will be widened so that anyone who is an adult parent, grandparent, child over 18 or sibling of a Ukrainian national living in the UK can apply to join them. A new visa sponsor route will also be created to let British businesses bring Ukrainians to the UK. The change was announced by No 10, with the home secretary, Priti Patel, expected to give more details in a Commons statement later on Tuesday afternoon.

3/1/2022,"The Munich Philharmonic Orchestra has sacked the star Russian conductor Valery Gergiev after he failed to speak out against the invasion of Ukraine or distance himself from his close friend and supporter Vladimir Putin. The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, said on Tuesday morning that Gergiev’s contract had been terminated with immediate effect. It came a day after the conductor’s management dropped him for refusing to end what it said was his “long-expressed support” for a “criminal regime”. The decision leaves Gergiev, hailed as one of world’s greatest conductors, more or less isolated in the world of classical music. The Scala in Milan, the Festspielhaus in Baden-Baden and the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg have also cut their ties with the 68-year-old. The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, which has run an annual Gergiev festival since 1996, is expected to cancel its event this September if the conductor does not end his support for Putin. In the US, Gergiev had already been replaced for several performances by the Vienna Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall in New York and in Naples, Florida, and for two performances again at Carnegie Hall in May where he was due to lead St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Orchestra, of which he is music director. Reiter said in a statement that Gergiev, who had been the chief conductor at the Munich Philharmonic since 2015, had refused a demand that he “distance himself unambiguously and unapologetically from the brutal war of aggression which Putin is leading against Ukraine and now in particular also against our partner city, Kyiv.” Reiter had appealed to the conductor in a letter on Friday to condemn the war, giving him until Monday evening to do so. “In the current situation, a clear signal for the orchestra, its audience, the general public and politics would be essential in order to enable further cooperation,” he said. Marcus Felsner, Gergiev’s former manager, on Sunday called him “the greatest conductor alive and an extraordinary human being with a profound sense of decency” but said he had no choice but to let him go as he “will not, or cannot, publicly end his long-expressed support for a regime that has come to commit such crimes.” He said: “In the light of the criminal war waged by the Russian regime against the democratic and independent nation of Ukraine, and against the European open society as a whole, it has become impossible for us, and clearly unwelcome, to defend the interests of Maestro Gergiev.” Felsner, who signed Gergiev in 2020, called it “the saddest day of my professional life”. Over the years, Gergiev’s close friendship with the Russian president, which began in the early 1990s, has drawn increasing criticism, particularly since the annexation of Crimea. In 2014, Gergiev was a signatory to an artists’ appeal that supported the annexation and in which he stated his clear support for Putin’s political views. In 2012 he appeared in an advert supporting Putin’s presidential campaign and in 2016 he conducted a concert in the Syrian city of Palmyra for an audience of Russian soldiers, government ministers and journalists after its capture from Islamic State. There has so far been no public reaction from Gergiev, and his US agent has yet to respond.",Arts/Music,Munich Philharmonic sacks conductor Valery Gergiev over failure to denounce Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/01/munich-philharmonic-sacks-conductor-valery-gergiev-over-failure-to-denounce-putin
