2/4/2022,"Parents who choose to home educate but fail to register their child with the local authority in England are likely to face sanctions, under government plans for a compulsory national register of children who are not in school. Under the proposals, parents who educate their child at home will face a new legal duty to supply information to a council-maintained register. There will also be a duty on local authorities to support families educating their children at home, offering general advice and examination support if requested.  Local authorities and child protection charities have long pushed for a mandatory national register of children not in school to help keep track of them, ensure they are receiving a suitable education, and ensure support and safeguarding for vulnerable children. The pressure has mounted during the course of the pandemic with increased numbers of pupils being taken out of school for elective home education and high absence rates in England. In November the Association of Directors of Children’s Services estimated that 115,542 children were home educated in 2020-21, a 34% increase on the previous year. The true figure could be far higher; the lack of a register makes it impossible to know. Ministers have promised to bring forward legislation at the earliest opportunity, but the government’s response on Thursday to a 2019 public consultation on the issue said the rollout was still “subject to securing the necessary resources”, and details of what penalties parents may face have yet to be determined. Responses to the consultation suggest there is likely to be fierce opposition from home education devotees. Among the 4,800 responses to the proposal that local authorities should be obliged to maintain a register of children who are not in school, 96% of local authorities agreed while 82% of parents and young people disagreed. Those opposed to the register and the associated duty on home-educating parents to provide information said it was an invasive and intrusive attack on parents’ rights and a waste of resources, while maintaining that education is a parental responsibility. Victoria Campbell, of the Portsmouth Home Education Group, said: “We are not surprised that the government will be pushing ahead with the register, even though there is no evidence to support its stated aim of protecting children. We also have concerns over it being abused by local authorities who already have a tendency to overstep their remit, causing damage to families in the process.” The Department for Education said: “The vast majority of home education is already done well but, particularly in light of the pandemic contributing to a rise in children not being educated in school, the government will support local authorities to make sure they know where every child is being educated, that it is of the right quality and that support is offered to home-educating families.” Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, was among those to welcome the proposal. She said: “The register of children not in school is vital in making sure that we are able to keep children safe and engaged, wherever they are learning.”",News/Education,Parents in England who fail to register home schooling could face sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/03/parents-in-england-who-fail-to-register-home-schooling-could-face-sanctions
2/4/2022,"Being an Islamic State leader is not what it used to be. The death of the latest IS supremo, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, far from the heartland of the terror group’s rise in Iraq in a frugal home in the back blocks of Syria, is another painful blow to an organisation that only five years ago held significant territory in both countries and cast a shadow across an entire region. Its slide ever since has been dramatic. Unable to hold land, its old guard wiped out, its finances shredded and rank and file depleted, IS looks – at face value – like a group that has had its day. And yet it still lurks amid the rubble of both countries, where it is slowly, yet assuredly stirring.  To many who study IS, a prison break last month in north-eastern Syria looked to be a sign of things to come. Dozens of extremists were able to plan and gather in the heart of one of the biggest cities in the country’s north-east and launch an audacious bid to free the up to 2,000 men inside. The battle to reclaim the prison raged for six days and, while it was eventually returned to the control of the Kurdish forces who run the province, the gap between disaster and triumph was narrow. The fighting was the first time since IS capitulated in the far eastern Syrian town of Bahguz in March 2019 that the remnants of the organisation had revealed itself en masse. That it could still stage a large operation in a major centre was a surprise to some – but not to Kurdish leaders, who had warned of this day since inheriting thousands of prisoners from the IS era and tens of thousands more of family members from towns and villages on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border. A journey though what was formerly a centre of IS’s self-proclaimed caliphate late last year revealed broken, impoverished communities still unreconciled after nearly a decade of upheaval. On the Iraqi side of the Euphrates River, in Anbar, the grievances date back nearly a decade more since the ousting of Saddam Hussein in the 2003 US-led invasion. A common theme in both countries remains that Sunni Muslims remain largely kept out of a flatlining political process and an ascendant regional push by the smaller Shia sect. Without Sunnis being able to meaningfully shape their outcomes while watching political rivals cement their gains, IS’s message of restoring lost glories and dignities will remain potent for some – just as it was when the terrorist juggernaut first gained steam. It is consequently still active. In Deir Azzour province, the anti-Isis coalition is carrying out raids against IS targets most days. Further west in Rojava, Kurdish counter-terrorism forces are also busy trying to weed out sleeper cells and ward off hit and run attacks – the type of low intensity insurgency that the group used so effectively in Iraq from 2004 to 2011. Except, this time it can carry out such attacks on both sides of the river. The risk of an escalation with a large number of prisoners and potential sympathisers in detention camps remains high. Kurdish leaders in Syria have been warning of the immense dangers in allowing thousands of IS men and families to gather on their soil and have urged the US and Europe to help find a solution. The ghosts of Camp Bucca in Iraq, the US post-invasion detention centre that acted as a an academy for the forerunners of IS, looms large in Kurdish thinking. Qurayshi was an alumnus, so too was his predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdad, his anointed successor, Abu Hassan al-Muhajjir, and the Isis number two, Sami Jassem who was arrested in Idlib last year and handed over to Iraqi forces. All four leaders had chosen Idlib as a refuge. With so many itinerants passing through and nondescript homes to hide in, many of the group’s most committed members now call it home. Its role as a new ground zero, so close to Turkey, has sounded a new alarm. Even more disturbing though would be to ignore the menace gathering in the shadows elsewhere in Syria.",News/World news,Islamic State’s head may be dead but its body still shows signs of life,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/islamic-states-head-may-be-dead-but-its-body-still-shows-signs-of-life
2/4/2022,"Tensions in societies around the world over the current Covid situation are going to be very difficult to handle, one of Britain’s most senior scientific figures has warned. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, who stepped down as a government scientific adviser in November last year, warned the idea of simply “exiting” a pandemic is not realisitc.  “I just don’t think you wake up on Tuesday and it’s finished. It’s not going to happen like that,” he said in an online meeting of the Royal Society of Medicine. “The transition from [the] acute phase of the pandemic to something new, not yet defined, it’s really difficult – bumpy, different around the world, different within a single country, with the degree of inequity that’s happened globally, but also nationally,” he said. Farrar noted one problem is that while some people may argue the pandemic is now in the past, and the situation in the middle of the pandemic was exaggerated, others believe it’s far from over. “And so the tensions, I think, within societies are going to be very difficult to handle,” he said. Farrar added that while he has sympathy with the disruption of education and the health and economic impacts of Covid he is concerned about the speed at which some want to move on. “My concern is that there will be too fast a shift to saying it’s all over and we will lose the humility of accepting that we’re only two years into a novel human pathogen, that is still a huge amount of uncertainty,” he said, adding it is also crucial to resolve the problem of vaccine inequality. While Farrar said the most likely scenario is that there will be a transition to Omicron becoming endemic, as the variant is less severe than others, it is not the only possibility. “My worry in the push to try and move on from this [is that] we ignore those other scenarios, which are less rosy but we should be absolutely prepared for,” he said. Farrar added that while he agreed it is time to begin easing Covid restrictions in the UK, he is in favour of keeping some measures. “I would be in favour of continuing for instance, mask wearing on public transport, in enclosed spaces, etc,” he said. “And I would be pushing ever harder on trying to encourage people to be vaccinated, get their boosting doses, and make sure that everybody has access to the vaccines from a UK perspective.” Farrar also warned that he has deep concerns about the global Covid situation, warning that the pandemic has been made worse “by a catastrophic failure of global diplomacy”. “The ongoing geopolitics of east /west but increasingly, understandably, north/south, because of vaccine inequity is going to lead to really troubling years ahead and will have ramifications beyond pandemics to our ability to come together to solve issues of inequality, of issues of climate change, of issues of drug resistance, of issues of migration and conflict,” he said.",News/World news,"World faces ‘bumpy, difficult’ Covid transition, says senior scientist",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/world-faces-bumpy-difficult-covid-transition-says-senior-scientist
2/4/2022,"Joe Biden on Thursday said US special forces “successfully removed a major threat to the world” after the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, blew himself up in a pre-dawn raid in Syria. “As troops approached, in a final act of desperate cowardice,” Qurayshi blew himself up the third floor of a house, killing his own family members, the US president said.  Biden called Qurayshi “Haji Abdullah”, said he had been responsible for a massive prison strike last month, and called him “the driving force between the genocide of the Yazidi people”. “Our forces carried out the operation with their signature preparation and precision and I directed the Department of Defense to take every precaution possible to minimize civilian casualties,” Biden said. Biden said: “Knowing that this terrorist had chosen to surround himself with families, including children, we made a choice to pursue a special forces raid at a much greater risk to our own people rather than targeting him with an airstrike. We made this choice to minimize civilian casualties.” When special forces approached Qurayshi, he detonated a bomb that blew himself up, “not just with the [suicide] vest but to blow up that third floor, rather than face justices for crimes he has committed, taking several members of his family with him, just as his predecessor did”, Biden said. By predecessor, Biden was referring to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed in October 2019 in a village nine miles south of Atme in the jihadist-controlled Idlib region, where Wednesday’s overnight raid took place. Thirteen people were killed, including women and children. Unicef has confirmed that at least six children died, and Betrand Bainvel, the acting Unicef regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said another girl was badly injured. In his remarks, Biden said that “thanks to the bravery of our soldiers, this horrible terrorist is no more”. He thanked the US special forces, the Syrian Democratic Forces for their “essential partnership”, the Department of Defense and members of the national security team. He also pledged to continue working with US allies including the Syrian Democratic Forces, Iraqi security forces including the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, and the roughly 80 members of the global coalition involved in the fight against the Islamic State. “Last night’s operation … sent a strong message to terrorists around the world. We will come after you and find you … We continue our unceasing effort to keep the American people safe and the strength and security of our allies and partners around the world,” Biden said.

2/4/2022,"It was a risk and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang knew it. Arsenal were always going to take a dim view of his trip to Barcelona on Monday morning, which was where the striker felt he had needed to be. Just in case. To give himself the best opportunity of making it happen. It was not authorised by Arsenal and so there was the possibility of the club fining him although, given the state of his relationship with them and, more specifically, the manager, Mikel Arteta, it had to have felt low down his list of concerns.  What was rather higher up was the potential to for him to become a laughing stock, a latter-day Peter Odemwingie. In January 2013 the then West Brom centre-forward had driven to QPR on deadline day, believing he was about to complete a transfer only to be left in his car outside Loftus Road. For Aubameyang, his father’s house in Sitges – a little way down the coast from Barcelona – was not exactly the Shepherd’s Bush roundabout but the reputational damage stood to be the same if things did not work out. And yet he has not got to where he is without having the courage of his convictions, without seeing a chance and going for it. As Aubameyang basked in the excitement and acclaim of his Barcelona unveiling at the Camp Nou on Thursday, having got his move at the last moment, there was a candid admission about Arteta. Had the problem at Arsenal simply been with him? “I think it was only with him and then he took this decision,” Aubameyang said. “He wasn’t happy and that’s it. I was calm.” More broadly, as Aubameyang held court in Spanish – his second language behind French and in front of Italian, English, German in that order of fluency – he was reminded of two things. First, the wisdom of trusting in his instincts and second, how it is possible in this crazy game for fortunes to change in the blink of an eye. A quick recap. Aubameyang had been dropped from the Arsenal squad by Arteta on 11 December for a disciplinary breach – a late return from an authorised trip to France; not his first problem with punctuality – then stripped of the club captaincy and cast into exile. The 32-year-old went to the Africa Cup of Nations with Gabon but he did not feature after testing positive for Covid and then being diagnosed with heart lesions. Gabon released him back to Arsenal on 17 January. Where he remained in the deep freeze; overlooked for selection, barred from training with his teammates. He was pushed towards a club in Saudi Arabia but he did not want that. When Arsenal went to Dubai for their warm-weather training break, he was left in London. Now Aubameyang stands at Barcelona, one of the biggest clubs in the world, with a contract until 2025, albeit with a break clause after 18 months. And the chance to prove a point to one man, in particular. “I am living a dream and I will work to stay here as long as I can,” Aubameyang said. “It has been a long time since I played a match but I am clear that I am ready to play and help. I have spoken to Xavi [the manager] and he sees me as a No 9. “Monday was a very long day, madness and we signed in the last two minutes. I was at my dad’s house, waiting for everything to be OK. In the afternoon, they called me to go and do the medical. There was a bit of stress at the end but it was all good.” What we know about Aubameyang’s crimes against Arteta is that one of them came last March when he reported late for the derby against Tottenham and was dropped to the bench. The month before, Aubameyang had been reminded of his responsibilities by the club after apparently breaching Covid rules to get a tattoo. Then it all kicked off in December when he missed his flight back from France. There had been lots of muttering about how he was always late; at which point, it is perhaps worth remembering the words of Thomas Tuchel, the Chelsea manager, who had Aubameyang at Borussia Dortmund. “When we wanted him to be on time, we told him the meeting was 10.45am when it was 11am,” Tuchel said last May. “He did not miss one single training session in two years. Maybe he arrived five minutes late – that can happen with him. But if he does this, he is in a hurry, he is sorry and he has still a smile on his face. That’s him, and it’s hard to be really mad with the guy. He has a big heart. A bit crazy but nice crazy.” Jürgen Klopp, who also managed Aubameyang at Dortmund, would say the same things and so would Christophe Galtier, the Nice coach, who worked with him at St Étienne. In other words, count to 10 when it comes to the scattiness; embrace the exuberance. Was there something else between Aubameyang and Arteta? Something more egregious? It almost feels as if there had to be. According to Ian Wright, there was nothing. “The saddest thing for me was that we don’t know what’s happened,” the former Arsenal striker said. “I don’t know and I’m in touch with Aubameyang.” When attitudes are perceived to be wrong, when conflict arises, Arteta does not tend to negotiate. Just ask Mateo Guendouzi or William Saliba, the Arsenal youngsters on loan at Marseille. Precocious talent can be petulant, challenging. Arteta seems to have zero tolerance; it is his way or the highway. Arteta has insisted that Aubameyang’s poor form this season was not a factor in his treatment of him, even if it is easy to wonder. What if Aubameyang had 14 Premier League goals instead of four? Aubameyang had no desire to leave Arsenal; unlike some of the club’s superstars from the not too distant past, he did not put in a transfer request. Rather he was forced to go, with Arteta wanting him out permanently, and not on loan. Aubameyang’s solution was to make his leap of faith, to travel to Barcelona, to show the club he meant business. The move drew nods of approval from them, as did his decision to accept a lower salary until the end of the season as Barcelona seek a way out of their economic crisis. “You know that when Barcelona’s finances are healthy, Barcelona will show gratitude to those who have helped Barcelona,” Joan Laporta, the president, told him. Aubameyang is back on the up. “They were difficult months,” he said of the end at Arsenal. “Football is like that sometimes. If I have to say anything about that, for my part I never believed I did anything bad. But it is behind me. I want to think of the present.”",Sport/Football,‘The problem was only with Arteta’: Aubameyang back on the up at Barça,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/aubameyang-the-problem-was-only-with-arteta-barcelona
2/4/2022,"As British households face a record 54% rise in energy billsfrom April, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced a £9bn plan intended to mitigate the cost-of-living crisis facing the nation. All households will receive a one-off £200 upfront discount on their energy bills this year, which, however, will be automatically recovered from people’s bills in £40 instalments over the five years from 2023.  Four-fifths of UK households will further qualify – on average – for a £150 rebate on council tax for homes in bands A to D, which will not be repayable. The number able to claim warm homes discount, which is availilbe for those receiving benefits, will be extended by a third to three million. Here, four householders share their reaction to Sunak’s announcement. John Lancaster, 72, from Burnley, feels partial relief about the news that he will benefit from the council tax rebate, which will go some way towards mitigating a huge rise in his energy bills. He and his wife were recently quoted a 12-month fixed duelfuel tariff of an estimated £255.51 a month – a 145% increase in their current monthly direct debit payment of £104.06. “We live in a band D property, so we will get the council tax rebate,” Lancaster said. “My wife, who is also retired, is disabled, so we are not going out a lot and heating our home is quite important. We will have to stop using some rooms and turn the heating off in them, and watch carefully what we spend on groceries. “We hopefully will be able to absorb the new payments somehow by cutting down on shopping and meals out for example. I really do not know how people worse off than us will manage.” The couple’s fixed dual-fuel contract with Octopus Energy is due to expire on 23 February. Lancaster tried to log into his account this morning to see whether their quote had changed since the announcement on the new energy cap. “But I couldn’t get in, there may have been too many people trying to do the same thing,” he said. “After getting our last quote, we decided not to renew to another fixed tariff until the new price cap was announced to see whether the tariffs offered would alter. We now have a couple of weeks until our contract runs out, so we will check whether other suppliers make more attractive offers.” “I don’t pay council tax so even though I’m eligible for the rebate it doesn’t apply to me,” said Sarah Moorby, from Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria. “It just won’t make any difference to mine and my children’s situation.” Moorby, who spoke to the Guardian earlier this week about the rise in energy bills, said she applied for a council tax reduction and as she receives universal credit, her council decided she did not have to pay anything. Even though her household is in council tax band C, she said both the rebate and the £200 repayable discount were “not as helpful as [they] could be” and did not “go far enough”. The 39-year-old welfare assistant who has three children said she would just have to prioritise her energy bill, which she fears may increase by about £2,500 a year, over other expenses like food and clothing. “They should be a priority too but they will just get pushed further and further down the list,” she added. Moorby was paying £105 a month with People Energy before the supplier went bust in September and moved to paying £209 a month with British Gas, a 99% increase. “The only other option will be to turn the heating and electricity off. They’re basic commodities that people should have access to, like shelter, food and water. But now they’ve become almost luxury items,” she said. “Even if I did turn the heating and electricity off and sat in a duvet in the dark, I would still have to pay standing charges. Also who wants to do that anyway? That’s not living.” Aaron Warren, 37, a business development manager from Colchester, has done the maths and is mentally preparing for a huge financial monthly hit from April. “I’m not going to gain anything from the chancellor’s support package, nothing at all. I will qualify for that energy bills rebate of £200, but that will have to be paid back. “Since last year our house is in council tax band F, so no luck there. My family will be around £400 a month worse off from April, due to a combination of higher energy bills and a national insurance rise of around £80 a month for my wife and myself each.” Warren and his wife both work full-time and several days a week from home to save thousands a year on commuting. The couple and their two young children, aged four and five, live in a four-bedroom semi-detached house built in the late 1980s. “Our house is pretty energy efficient, but according to our latest quote we will be paying £365 for energy a month if we stay on a variable contract, and £387 if I fix our tariff for two years. In November 2020, our monthly bill was £118. Just enormous increases, it’s pretty upsetting. “Some companies have quoted me over £400 a month – I never in a million years thought that’s how much I’d be paying for gas and electricity. The British Gas website kept crashing today, people are panicking now.” Warren said the family’s spending behaviour would have to be adjusted to make up for this substantial rise in living costs. “We’re fortunate enough to be earning quite well, but we have two young children and costly childcare, and we’re changing our shopping habits already. I can see that many families will be in dire straits. You just feel like you keep getting hit.” “I don’t know how they [the government] expect people to afford it,” said Kate Ross, from Isleworth, west London. “I work from home mostly and when you do that your bills are bound to be more than usual,” added the 34-year-old. Ross, who works for a design and build company, said she and her wife used to pay about £63 a month in September 2020 for their gas and electricity with Bulb Energy, which they have been with for five years. They were asked to increase their monthly direct debit on their fixed rate tariff to £154.94, a rise of 146%. She said the one-off £200 discount for households was “not enough” and even though they are also eligible for the £150 council tax rebate, it “doesn’t really cut it”, said Ross. “How much is that going to equate over a year? It’s nothing really,” she added.",Lifestyle/Money,‘It doesn’t really cut it’: households react to Sunak’s energy bills support,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/03/it-doesnt-really-cut-it-households-react-to-rishi-sunak-energy-bills-support
2/4/2022,"Trevor Noah unpacked the Cuomo scandal fallout at CNN, also known as “the channel you watch at the gym while you listen to a podcast”, the Daily Show host said on Wednesday evening.  Jeff Zucker resigns as CNN records another explosive, Cuomo-related scandal pic.twitter.com/5M0YxxM0mK Earlier in the day, the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, announced his surprise resignation after he disclosed a consensual relationship with a colleague. “As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years,” Zucker said in a statement. “I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong.” “Man, this must’ve been a really weird day for CNN,” Noah said. “On the one hand, it’s bad that your boss is resigning under a cloud of scandal. On the other hand, you got the scoop! “You may not know this, but he’s the one who made CNN what it is today,” Noah added on Zucker, who joined CNN in 2013. “He’s the one who pushed it toward entertainment more, and less news. He’s the one who said, ‘Enough of those international correspondents, let’s just get people fighting on camera!’ Like you remember when CNN would just make us watch Trump’s empty podium for an hour? That was his choice.” Zucker often kept Donald Trump on air, even before his election in 2016, “because he liked Trump”, Noah explained. “Because he knew Trump was good for ratings, because Jeff Zucker is the one who gave Trump the job for The Apprentice, and The Apprentice is the only reason that Trump went on to become the president – agh!!!” But the craziest part of the story, Noah concluded, was how far the blast radius from former New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s scandals reached. “So Andrew Cuomo was such a creep that he took down himself, his brother Chris and the president of CNN,” Noah said. “He’s like Ronan Farrow but by accident.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers responded to a statement from the National Archives that Trump tore up many of his official White House documents. “It doesn’t surprise me that Trump treated official presidential records the way the rest of us treat credit card offers from Discover or the way I treat autograph requests from my wife’s niece,” he said. “Also, let’s all spare a thought for the federal employee who had to tape all of Donald Trump’s presidential records back together,” he added. “Just getting Ziploc after Ziploc of confetti soaked in hand sweat, trying to figure out which words to put together to form sentences. Piecing together Trump’s notes is like fishing a bunch of magnetic poetry out of a garbage disposal.” Meyers also lamented more news of Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, such as a report from the House committee investigating January 6 that he directed Rudy Giuliani to ask the Department of Homeland Security about seizing voting machines in key states. “Man, Trump tried everything: the justice department, homeland security, swing state lawmakers, even Rudy Giuliani,” Meyers said. “Of all people, I can’t believe and yet I can believe that he had Rudy call the Department of Homeland Security. Although, who knows with Rudy – it could’ve been a butt dial.” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert looked into the lawsuit against the NFL by former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores for racial discrimination. “Now, sure, almost 70% of NFL players are Black, and there’s only one Black head coach in the entire league, but the NFL can’t be racist! They spray-painted a tiny ‘end racism’ next to the Kansas City Chiefs logo!” Colbert joked. Flores was fired by Miami on 10 January, despite leading the team to its first back-to-back winning seasons since 2003. “Despite his overall record, winning seven of his last eight games this season, Flores was fired, apparently because he did not get along and go along with the owner,” Colbert said. But eight other teams also lost their coaches, and Flores got several interviews for open positions, including with the New York Giants. Such coaching searches are bound by the NFL’s “Rooney Rule”, which requires NFL teams to interview a diverse range of candidates for head coaching jobs and other leadership positions. “It’s a great idea, gives everybody an opportunity, unless you don’t give an opportunity to anybody, which is what happened in this case,” Colbert explained. Flores learned via mistaken text from Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots coach, that the head coaching job had gone to someone else – three days before his interview with the team. “So he’s saying they wasted his time just to check a pretend box about how they pretend care about diversity,” Colbert noted, “though I imagine it did take the pressure off the job interview – ‘Where do I see myself in five years? Uh, I don’t know, suing you?’” Flores is still in the running for two other head coaching jobs, “which is what makes this lawsuit even more impressive”, Colbert concluded. “You see, the NFL, generally speaking – not very forgiving to anyone who stands up to them, or kneels near them. So Flores, who is only 40 years old, has put his future livelihood on the line here, but he’s doing it for a higher purpose.”",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah on CNN fallout from Andrew Cuomo: ‘He’s like Ronan Farrow but by accident’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/03/trevor-noah-cnn-jeff-zucker-cuomo-daily-show-recap
2/4/2022,"An Italian former priest dubbed “Don Euro” by his parishioners because he kept pestering them for money has been jailed for extorting a former bishop. Luca Morini served as a priest in the Tuscan village of Pontasserchio before being defrocked by the Vatican amid a series of scandals, culminating with a court in Massa Carrara sentencing him on Wednesday to seven and a half years in prison for extortion.  He was also convicted of assuming a false identity after masquerading as a judge when hiring male sex workers but acquitted on charges of extorting a nun, drug dealing and money laundering. Morini was reportedly considered “a good-natured priest” when he first arrived in Pontasserchio, a village of about 2,600 inhabitants close to Pisa. But he soon earned the nickname Don Euro after persuading his mostly elderly parishioners to donate generously to the church’s collection plate, with the money allegedly being splurged on parties, diamonds, luxury holidays with sex workers and visits to swingers’ clubs. Legal investigations into his shenanigans only began in 2015 after one of the sex workers blew the whistle on him and his lavish spending, revealing that Morini had posed as a judge, and after he was exposed by the TV show Le Iene. Four men, including the original whistleblower, brought a case against Morini for false identity and were awarded €14,000 (£12,000) in compensation by the court. Morini’s parishioners claimed to Le Iene that he was always pestering them for money, even during confessions, although they never officially reported him. Morini’s conviction for extortion related to Giovanni Santucci, the former bishop of Massa Carrara. Santucci had suspended Morini from priest duties and was allegedly blackmailed into loaning him thousands of euros and buying him a €200,000 house. Santucci resigned from his post last year. Prosecutors had asked for a prison term of eight and a half years, but Morini’s defence team argued that he was suffering from mental illness and his sentence was reduced.

They work like a camera obscura, she says, but for human nature: “By looking indirectly at the thing they wanted to focus on, they were sometimes able to see it even more clearly than with their own eyes.” What, exactly, our narrator might be focusing on animates this novella like a ghost. Cold Enough for Snow is the second book from Melbourne writer Jessica Au. It won her the first Novel prize in 2020 and comes a decade after her acclaimed debut, Cargo. The plot is simple; “deceptively” so, as some reviews have noted: mother and adult daughter visit Japan, see the sights, take in art and food, go home. What we hear of their conversation is quotidian and understated, at frustrating odds with the narrator’s pressing hunger for connection. Memories swirl of interactions with others: her partner Laurie, with whom she’s considering a child; the lecturer who introduced her to “the classics”; an unsettling customer at the Chinese restaurant where she once worked.  What links these apparently undirected reminiscences is a preoccupation with care. The narrator’s mother and uncle, born in Hong Kong, are “careful” in their gestures, take “care with [their] clothes and appearance”. She recalls her mother “perfectly repairing and adjusting” her childhood clothes; the objects “carefully chosen” in her lecturer’s home; Laurie “carefully measuring and planing back the wood” for his father’s studio. “Attention, taken to its highest degree,” as Simone Weil wrote, “is the same thing as prayer. It presupposes faith and love.” Au’s calm, unrelenting focus would be hard to take over a longer book – but this novella is graceful and precise. Like the narrator fine-tuning the aperture on her Nikon camera, Au seems to say, we have to choose our scale, what we pay attention to. The narrator, hunting for deeper significance, is shadowed by the possibility this choice might just be random. She envies Laurie’s ability to “see things that others might miss”, and alerts herself to the “small details” in Japan’s subdued museums, bathhouses, bookshops. Glazed ceramics, fabrics, leaves, paintings: meaning floats to the surface, then scatters, as on rippling water. She takes her mother to an impressionist exhibition in Tokyo, full of “paths and gardens and ever-changing light, [showing] the world not as it was but some version of the world as it could be, suggestions and dreams.” The two women peacefully make their way through shaded parks and forests, muted subways and shops. An older Japan – of villages, lanterns, temples – “halfway between a cliche and the truth”, shimmers through the “gentle rain”. In contrast, the narrator’s home in Australia seems soulless and overly bright, with its vast freeways, sprawling suburbs and screeching birds. The objects that stand out to her on the trip – a piece of jewellery, a photo, a bowl – betray her yearning for a more intimate scale. What the narrator wants is ways to “know someone and to have them know me”. The trip seems obsessively planned around experiences that might spark some shared vocabulary with her mother, down to the time of evening that “might be nice” for a certain restaurant. A melancholy detachment seeps into all this perfect composure – an anxious sense of being outside the moment, not dissimilar to that seen in Katherine Brabon’s The Shut Ins, or Katie Kitamura’s Intimacies. Another, lost vocabulary hovers: her mother’s first language is Cantonese, hers is English – “we only ever spoke together in one”. Cold Enough for Snow is filled with meticulous observation: temperature (“the subtropical feel, the smell of the steam and the tea and the rain”); colour (“a blue plate, the colour of agate, on which white flowers, probably lotuses, were painted, and … a mud-brown bowl, whose inside was the colour of eggshells”); light (as a rule, “milky”). The narrator reflects on the way she too is observed – by her lover as she falls asleep, in the way “one is able to look upon a person one knows well”. One way to know anything, perhaps the only way, is looking. Finally, we bump up against what is not knowable. Au has mentioned her taste for “subverting narrative expectation … open endings, scenes in which nothing happens yet everything happens”. Cold Enough for Snow is exactly this, a book of inference and small mysteries. The stories, memories and images Au puts on the table escape easy conclusions – like the lines of a screen painting the narrator admires: “Some were strong and definite, while others bled and faded, giving the impression of vapour. And yet, when you looked, you saw something: mountains, dissolution, form and colour running forever downwards.” Aesthetic, opaque, endlessly uncoiling. Cold Enough for Snow by Jessica Au is out now in Australia ($24.95, Giramondo), in US on 15 February (New Directions) and in the UK on 22 February (Fitzcarraldo).",Arts/Books,Cold Enough for Snow by Jessica Au review – a graceful novella about how we pay attention,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/cold-enough-for-snow-by-jessica-au-review-a-graceful-novella-about-how-we-pay-attention
2/4/2022,"The government is struggling to secure the support of three key backbenchers for its controversial religious discrimination bill ahead of next week’s crucial parliamentary sitting. Labor and the Coalition are on Friday poised to deliver joint reports calling for the bill to be considered for passage through parliament.  Stakeholders tracking two inquiries, expect Labor to express concerns about the contentious statements of belief clause and exemptions allowing religious institutions to discriminate on the grounds of religion, but to ultimately not oppose the bill. But the government is yet to gain the support of three of its backbenchers, Liberal moderates who are still holding out despite a deal to protect LGBT students. Although the in-principle support for the bill does not commit Labor to vote for it, it has caused consternation among some LGBT activists who wanted the opposition to take a harder line, including to require the amendments to protect LGBT students be tabled first. Others are hopeful, as they see it as consistent with Labor’s position that it supports banning discrimination on the basis of religion and allows plenty of latitude to strip the bill of add-ons that give religious groups privileges not contained in other discrimination laws. On Thursday Scott Morrison announced the government would introduce an amendment that would prevent students being expelled from school for their sexuality or gender, to be included in the religious discrimination package. The move, which infuriated conservative Christian groups, fulfils a deal with four Liberal MPs – Angie Bell, Katie Allen, Dave Sharma and Fiona Martin – made in December in return for their support for the religious bill. But the remaining trio of holdouts – Bridget Archer, Warren Entsch and Trent Zimmerman – indicated the amendment would not be sufficient for their support. Archer told Guardian Australia the amendment was a “positive step forward” but it “doesn’t shift my position at all” because the concern over LGBT students “is only a fraction of the issue with the bill”. Archer said she was concerned with the “explicit override of Tasmanian anti-discrimination laws”, as the religious bill explicitly overrides its laws banning speech that “offends, insults, or humiliates” people based on other protected attributes. “I agree there should be freedom from discrimination on any attribute including religion, sexuality, or parenting status. “For me – it’s the statement of belief that is problematic in that regard – it goes beyond freedom from discrimination and extends to entrenching religious privilege.” “I value our gold standard anti-discrimination laws … I’m not prepared to stand by and see them eroded, the Tasmanian government doesn’t want to see them eroded.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Archer said her objections would be “very hard to overcome” unless the bill was stripped back to an “orthodox discrimination bill” that simply prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion. Entsch said negotiations were “a work in progress” that he would not conduct through the media, adding: “I’m at the stage of my political career where I’m more concerned with outcomes than reputation.” Zimmerman, who has previously called for discrimination against LGBT teachers to also be banned, confirmed he has reserved his position, at least until he sees the committee inquiry reports. Labor MP Josh Burns told Guardian Australia it would “be helpful if the government would reveal if it is planning on amending the bill”. Burns noted the “conflicting public statements” between attorney general, Michaelia Cash, who said in December that amending the Sex Discrimination Act to protect LGBT students would wait for 12 months and a further review, and the prime minister on Thursday who appeared to commit to an amendment in the religious discrimination package itself. Burns, a member of the joint human rights committee that considered the bill, said he had “no idea” which was the government’s position. The government has listed the religious discrimination bills on the Senate program for Wednesday, suggesting they could try to pass them in the lower house on Tuesday, but Labor is increasingly confident that with the Coalition split on its own side the bills may not be forced to a vote. Labor caucus resolved in November that it would reserve its final position until after the inquiries were completed. If the government forced a vote Labor would “not oppose” the bill in the house, while making clear “the need for the government to deliver on its three-year-old commitment to protect LGBT students from discrimination”, caucus resolved. Labor will not resolve its position until it sees the final version of the bill, meaning the shadow ministry and caucus meetings on Monday may not even consider it, because Morrison’s flagged amendments are still yet to be tabled.",News/Australia news,Liberal holdouts unswayed by changes to religious discrimination bill as Labor unlikely to oppose,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/liberal-holdouts-unswayed-by-changes-to-religious-discrimination-bill-as-labor-unlikely-to-oppose
2/4/2022,"Western Australia’s food supply crisis is “the worst in living memory” with the state’s umbilical cord to the eastern states severed, not by Covid or border closure, but by extreme weather. Flooding in South Australia has washed out more than 300km of the only rail line that brings food and supplies into WA from the east coast.  With border closures already isolating WA from the nation and the world, a one-in-200-year weather event is squeezing inbound supplies, leaving many supermarket shelves bare. Staples such as pasta, sugar, toilet paper, medicines, sanitary items, some meats and frozen foods are running low but fruit, vegetables and milk that are locally produced are less affected. Major supermarket chains, including Coles and Woolworths, were forced on Thursday to introduce buying limits on some products and the Independent Food Distributors Australia chief executive, Richard Forbes, said the crisis could continue for up to six weeks. “This is the worst disruption to the food supply chain into Western Australia in living memory because of the reliance the food industry has on the Trans-Australian Railway,” Forbes said. The 100-year-old rail line runs for nearly 2,000km from Port Augusta in South Australia to Kalgoorlie in WA and is the world’s longest completely straight track. “It’s a logistical nightmare to try to solve because we now have to think how we are going to get 90% of our product that comes from rail transported in, in another form – and that’s with trucks. “In the trucking industry, we are short of truck drivers because of Covid and it’s costing small business a fortune because of price gouging.” The Australian Trucking Association was contacted for comment. The WA transport minister, Rita Saffioti, said a “rail bridge” had been established to allow normally prohibited 53.5 metre-long road trains with three semi-trailers attached to travel to Kalgoorlie. They are likely to arrive on Friday and depart for Perth two days later, with double road trains now allowed into the metropolitan area. “We are getting more trucks and bigger trucks and we are looking at the shipping option,” Saffioti said. “I have spoken to Coles and Woolworths today and they have some committed shipping options, but they will take a while and it’s really about making sure that the backlog of supply that is over there [on the east coast] can be brought over here. “It highlights that we need to ensure that we have a more resilient east-west supply chain connection.” Saffioti said the rail line should be re-opened by 17 February and that air charter was also an option. She reassured people that there was plenty of fresh produce in WA. A federal emergency meeting was discussing the use of defence ships and aircraft to transport products into the state, Saffioti said. But Forbes said using boats and ports was a slow option. He is calling for compensation for WA food distributors who supply 6,500 venues, including schools, military bases, hospitality, care homes and hospitals. Across Australia, poultry and meat products are already in short supply as Covid affects the workforce at meat processing plants and suppliers. The flooding has also affected roads running up and down the country and the NT Road Transport Association executive officer, Louise Bilato, said that trucks were being forced to detour 3,000km through Queensland from Adelaide, affecting supplies into the territory. “It’s the perfect storm, unfortunately, because we were already compromised by the distribution of networks in NSW and Victoria impacted by Covid,” she said. Forbes said the issue wasn’t going to be solved as soon as the rail line was fixed because it would take time to get the network up and running again. A wave of Omicron cases is continuing to grow across WA that has forced hundreds of teachers and students into isolation in the first week of school. Authorities and supermarkets are urging customers to be respectful and only buy what they need. A Coles spokesperson said from Thursday, temporary limits were in place across all WA supermarkets, online and Coles Express stores to help manage demand for key items. Items limited to one unit a customer include rapid antigen test kits and toilet paper. Regular pain medication is limited to two packets a customer as are chicken breasts and chicken thighs from the meat department, and sausages, tissues, flour, sugar, rice and pasta, among other items. At Woolworths, a two-pack limit has been issued for flour, sugar, rice, pasta, eggs, and paper towels, among other items. A stricter one item-only limit applies to rapid antigen test kits and toilet paper.",News/Australia news,‘A logistical nightmare’: flooding takes out sole rail link sparking West Australian food shortage,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/a-logistical-nightmare-flooding-takes-out-sole-rail-link-sparking-west-australian-food-shortage
2/4/2022,"Palm Springs, in the words of Andy Samberg’s character, Nyles, is “one of those infinite time loop situations you might’ve heard about”. Which serves as the baseline for a hugely enjoyable, feel-good romantic comedy that incorporates a compelling science fiction element and a nice bit of existential dread to stop things getting too sentimental. Nyles and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) meet at a wedding in Palm Springs. After an eventful reception, Sarah follows Nyles into a cave in the desert where she steps into a glowing red light, only to awake once again, on the morning of the ceremony. It becomes clear that an earthquake opened up a fissure in space/time, and in entering the cave the pair became caught in time loop, doomed to repeat the day of the wedding forever.  It transpires that Nyles has been trapped in this infinite loop for longer than he can remember, resigned to the fact he will never experience linear time again. It also comes to light that Sarah is not the first person to have accidentally joined Nyles in this temporal purgatory. Another wedding guest, Roy (JK Simmons), also entered the cave rift and is pretty furious about it. He is determined to make Nyles pay, infinitely, for ruining his life. As Nyles and Sarah explore the all the potential paths and limitations of circular time, they begin to have fun and enjoy each other’s company, all while trying to find a way back to their own reality. Released in 2020 as the pandemic was in full swing, Palm Springs’ modest, temporal adventure could not have landed at a more appropriate time. Repeating the same day again and again suddenly became relatable. But it’s Palm Springs’ good heart that really makes it resonate. Despite the wry, sarcastic vein of humour that runs through it and its deviations into existential despair, Palm Springs’ goal is to lift your spirits. There is a perverted optimism to its idea that life is pointless, but less pointless in the company of someone else. It would be remiss not to mention Harold Ramis’ iconic time loop comedy, Groundhog Day, which transcended its status as a movie to establish an entire subgenre unto itself. But although Palm Springs is certainly a part of that subgenre and shares common DNA with the Bill Murray classic, Groundhog Day does not cast a long shadow over it. Palm Springs has more than enough questions and original ideas bouncing around to make it equally satisfying. Nyles and Sarah’s initial approach to being caught in the time loop is what might best be described as joyfully nihilistic. Nyles is long resigned to the fact escape is impossible and, by the time Sarah joins him, “nothing matters” is virtually his mantra. The only wisdom he can share is that she needs to “learn how to suffer existence”. To that end, Nyles spends his time day drinking and living “with as little effort as possible”. But Sarah, too, was unhappy with her life and shares Nyles’ outlook, believing everyone is alone and that people marry simply out of fear of loneliness. Now, that might all sound a bit bleak and, I guess, ideologically that might be accurate. But Palm Springs has a light touch and, as Nyles is quick to inform us, “being a source of terror is not fun” so things never get dark enough to drain the story’s energy or pour cold water on Samberg and Milioti’s spark. It helps that both Palm Springs’ leads are very appealing and share a great chemistry. Sure they’re both cynical, but they’re utterly charming with it. They ponder philosophical reasons for their predicament, as well as the scientific, but at the end of the day it’s simply great fun to watch them explore their corner of space/time together and slowly grow closer. Simmons is also on top form as the angry and vengeful Roy – equal parts Charles Bronson and friendly neighbour. It feels conceptually appropriate to have rewatched Palm Springs quite a few times and it displays no law of diminishing returns. It is as absolutely joyful the second time, the third time and so on, as it is the first. Which means Palm Springs has quickly become a member of that most treasured of genres – the comfort movie. Palm Springs is one of those rare films that never gets old, whose repetition only makes it more endearing, so it can be relied upon whenever we need a pick-me-up.",Arts/Culture,Palm Springs: feel-good infinite time loop romcom serves side order of existential dread,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/04/palm-springs-feel-good-infinite-time-loop-romcom-serves-side-order-of-existential-dread
2/4/2022,"When Gwen Kong lost her job in sales and account management in February 2020, she became one of the many women thrust into economic insecurity by the pandemic. During the following 12 months and amid several lockdowns, she left a long-term relationship, moved in with a family member, and picked up some contract work but missed out on many opportunities, some because she was “too qualified”.  “It got to the stage where I took my CV to the supermarket and they just turned around and said, ‘What are we going to do with you?’” Kong said. By the time Victoria was onto its fifth lockdown, her confidence had taken a hit. “I was pretty much at the end of my tether when I got a call from my bank and they told me about Fitted for Work. So I bit the bullet and I reached out to them for help,” she said. “It was big for me because I never allow anyone to see me as the victim. You can call me proud; I allow no one to see me in that vulnerable state.” Donna de Zwart, the managing director of Fitted for Work, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to helping women experiencing disadvantage find employment, said Kong’s story was one of many. “There is a real hidden epidemic within the pandemic of women that we just don’t know about. Women who’ve given up work, purely because they’ve had to take the brunt of those carrying responsibility, or lost work,” she said. The organisation supported Kong in several ways – it provided her with feedback on her CV, tips to improve her LinkedIn profile, clothes and makeup for job interviews and monthly check-ins on the phone. She also participated in online workshops alongside women in similar circumstances. “You know sometimes when you’re so down you can’t pull yourself up, then you speak to other people and you know it’s not that bad? That’s what it was. It was so nice to have a group of women to talk to, especially during lockdown,” Kong said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The 49-year-old has since found work – albeit casual – with a recruitment agency, secured a rental in Melbourne’s CBD and is slowly building her confidence back. “I’m determined to work my way back up,” Kong said. Fitted for Work is one of six organisations to receive a share of $1.1m in new funding from the Victorian government to help women overcome barriers to economic security. The funding will support more than 800 women at greater risk of economic insecurity, including single mothers, Aboriginal women, women over the age of 45, women with a disability and women from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, including migrants and refugees. The state’s minister for women, Gabrielle Williams, said the pandemic had disproportionately impacted women, given they have been more likely to lose work, suffer severe financial impacts and shoulder an even greater share of unpaid caring responsibilities. “As our state recovers from the pandemic, all Victorians need the opportunity to rebuild so that no one gets left behind. That’s exactly what this funding will do,” she said. De Zwart said the funding would allow the organisation to increase the number of services on offer to keep up with demand. While the organisation supports women of all ages and backgrounds, de Zwart has noticed an increase in older women struggling to find employment post-pandemic. “We’ve got a whole generation of women who are feeling incredibly anxious about their futures,” she said. “It’s the one time in a woman’s life where she’s really able to devote herself to her career because she’s got the space to be able to do that. But we do live in an incredibly ageist society.” Kong admits it’s been challenging trying to secure full-time employment. “Particularly as an Asian woman, people have this perspective that you don’t speak English well,” she said. “But I’ve decided that my life from now on, it’s all about positivity. If I’ve had a shit day, I will allow myself 20 minutes, half an hour to feel shit, allow myself to be down, allow myself to cry and after that I’m going to pick myself up.”",News/Australia news,Australian women thrust into economic insecurity in Covid’s ‘hidden epidemic’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/australian-women-thrust-into-economic-insecurity-in-covids-hidden-epidemic
2/4/2022,"“They were all saying she was coming home,” Bec Rees says. Her mother, Sue, had gone into hospital in Melbourne with a burst ear drum. She also had cancer. Then she got Covid. She didn’t come home.  Sue Rees was 74, and when she died on 8 January she became one of more than 1,500 deaths reported in Australia in this latest surge of the global pandemic. As Australia’s death toll grows, we know very little about who has died. Daily press conferences reveal the rising number, often accompanied by the disclaimer that those who died had “underlying conditions”. The director and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, Prof Brendan Crabb, says that sort of language risks dividing people into the “ones we care about and the ones we don’t”. “A very large proportion of us do have an underlying condition – heart conditions, diabetes … even if that wasn’t the case, does it matter?” Sue would have hated being a statistic, her daughter says. “She always hated taking off her clothes, her pearls, her brightly coloured tops … if you dress the same as everyone else, they stop talking to you as an individual with a personality and start treating you like a two-dimensional cardboard cut out. “She got caught up in a system where she was just treated like a number and no one could see who she was. When you’re in those hospital gowns you just become one of thousands. Faceless, soulless, you’re just a nobody.” Sue Rees was not a nobody. She was the sort of person who saw Les Misérables six times – and convinced Bec to gatecrash the after party with her. She was the kindest soul around, her daughter says, but incredibly competitive. When it came to any sort of game she always played to win. Even Connect Four. She was a flowergirl at her daughter’s wedding. Once, Bec broke Sue out of hospital to see Hugh Jackman live in concert. She sang and danced for hours, Bec says, “with a Picc in her arm” to deliver her chemotherapy drugs. Sue got back, washed off the blood, and hummed a Jackman song. Sue had lymphoma, a cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. She was undergoing chemotherapy in the oncology ward at Epworth Richmond. In early December, there was talk of her being discharged. A week later, she caught Covid from a staff member and was transferred to the Alfred Hospital. Rees held her mother’s hand as she died, after being “100%” convinced she would come home. “All the feedback from the doctors, her nurses, her vital signs, they all were saying she’s coming home despite all the comorbidities,” Bec says. “It feels heartless and faceless for all of the victims when [other victims] have stories given to them, photos shown of them, they were memorialised, they were remembered. These Covid victims had a face and a story, and right now they’re just a statistic.” Sue’s memorial was at One Tree Hill in Tremont, in the Dandenong Ranges, which bears the same name as the spot on Hamilton Island where Bec got married. Sue declared her time there “the time of her life”. “She has been taken from you sooner than she would have otherwise been, had it not been for Covid-19,” celebrant Jacqui Chaplin told the mourners, as she invited them to both grieve and celebrate Sue’s life. They heard about a childhood accident, Sue’s love of tennis, her marriage (after it ended she declared she had “downsized” both her home and husband), work, children and grandchildren. She was a “cool Mum” and a “great cook” who became a personal carer. Then she needed care, after she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Over 10 years she had 18 specialists and more than 50 surgeries, but she survived. Until Covid. Bec has taken off on a road trip up the east coast. She’s thinking about Cairns next, or Palm Cove, or somewhere else. And, of course, she’s thinking about her mum. Asked what first comes into her mind, she says: “She was the kind of person that would go to any length to help others, protect others, support others, and make sure that they were OK before worrying about herself. “She was so much more than a statistic.”",News/Australia news,‘She was so much more than a statistic’: a vibrant Melbourne life cut short by Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/she-was-so-much-more-than-a-statistic-a-vibrant-melbourne-life-cut-short-by-covid
2/4/2022,"The Morrison government is being urged by one of its own backbenchers to “face facts” and accept the use of the term apartheid in relation to Israel. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that “no country is perfect” in response to a new Amnesty International report that concluded Israel had “perpetrated the international wrong of apartheid, as a human rights violation and a violation of public international law”.  But Ken O’Dowd, a Queensland Liberal National party MP, said he would encourage the Australian government to take the report “on board” and act on some of its findings. “The report has come as no surprise to me,” O’Dowd said. “It confirms what I’ve seen on my two trips to Palestine … I’ve seen it with my own eyes and you can’t deny what you see with your own eyes.” Asked whether the Australian government should accept the use of the term apartheid, or whether that was too politically difficult, O’Dowd said: “I don’t think it’s too difficult. Let’s face facts – the fact is there is a form of apartheid existing and it should be corrected. It’s not fair at the moment.” O’Dowd, who first used the term apartheid in a speech to parliament in November and is a member of Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, said in an interview on Thursday that human rights were being neglected and new settlements were “eating into Palestinian lands”. O’Dowd’s position on the term apartheid puts him at odds with the federal government’s official stance. It is not thought to be a widely shared view within Coalition ranks, although the Nationals MP for the NSW seat of Parkes, Mark Coulton, told parliament in November he thought the situation was “a level of apartheid, with a suppressed people”. A spokesperson for the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said on Wednesday in response to the Amnesty report: “We do not agree with the report’s characterisations of Israel, and we remain a firm supporter of the State of Israel.” Labor, too, has stopped short of applying the apartheid label, arguing it was “not a term that’s been found to apply by any international court” and “not helpful in progressing the meaningful dialogue and negotiation necessary”. But the opposition’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said the findings of the Amnesty report were concerning, and the government should “review it closely, assess the situation on the ground and make representations about Australia’s view”. On Thursday Liberal senator Eric Abetz and Labor senator Kimberley Kitching issued a joint statement to reject the report’s “attempts to equate Israel’s efforts to the abhorrent historical practice of apartheid in South Africa”. Abetz, who chairs the Australian Parliamentary Friends of Israel, and Kitching, the deputy chair, said: “Amnesty does such good work, which we support. But pretending Tel Aviv in 2022 is like Cape Town in 1976 is demonstrably wrong and needs to be called out, without rancour, just sadness.” “The misappropriation of hateful words does nothing to aid the peace process for a mutually negotiated and enduring two-state solution where Israel and a future Palestinian state can coexist in peace and security,” they said. The comments came after Amnesty called on the international community to “urgently and drastically change its approach” and “recognise the full extent of the crimes that Israel perpetrates against the Palestinian people”. “Indeed, for over seven decades, the international community has stood by as Israel has been given free rein to dispossess, segregate, control, oppress and dominate Palestinians,” Amnesty said in its 280-page report. The London-based human rights organisation said it had concluded “almost all of Israel’s civilian administration and military authorities, as well as governmental and quasi-governmental institutions, are involved in the enforcement of the system of apartheid against Palestinians”. Amnesty said it had identified acts that “amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid” under the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute of the international criminal court. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Israel’s government has strongly dismissed the report, saying the findings were “divorced from reality” and Amnesty “quotes lies spread by terrorist organisations”. Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, said if Israel were not a Jewish state, “nobody in Amnesty would dare argue against it”. Morrison said on Wednesday all countries were subjected to “criticisms” but his government would “remain a staunch friend of Israel”. The Australian government’s position is to support “a two-state solution, with Israel and a future Palestinian state establishing internationally recognised borders”. Australia urged “all parties to refrain from actions and statements that undermine the prospects for peace”, said a spokesperson for Payne.",News/Australia news,‘There is a form of apartheid’: LNP backbencher urges PM to face facts on Israel,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/there-is-a-form-of-apartheid-lnp-backbencher-urges-pm-to-face-facts-on-israel
2/4/2022,"New buy now, pay later-style schemes targeting renters are “preying on the vulnerable”, say consumer advocates who have renewed calls for the federal government to overhaul credit laws to better regulate the sector. A recent entrant into the market, Tenanting, which is owned by PropTech Group, follows the model of buy now, pay later (BNPL) products such as Afterpay, which offer microloans for retail purchases that users can then pay back in four instalments.  Tenanting advertises that it will pay rent on an individual’s behalf “instantly” with the user repaying it over four instalments with the addition of a 5% fee. Financial Counselling Australia (FCA) has taken aim at the company, calling it “yet another alarming example of a fintech company taking advantage of loopholes in the credit laws”. Spokesperson James Hunt said financial counsellors were increasingly seeing people harmed by BNPL-style products and they were warning people against using them for day-to-day living expenses such as groceries or rent. “Using products like these might seem easy and harmless but the charges quickly add up and the next thing you know you’re in even more financial trouble,” Hunt said. “We’re very worried that will only exacerbate financial hardship.” Greater Sydney’s median weekly rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $515, according to the Tenants’ Union of New South Wales. The addition of a 5% fee would leave the average renter paying $25.75 more a week, a significant amount for someone on a low income. Fiona Guthrie, the chief executive of Financial Counselling Australia, wrote on Thursday to the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the federal minister for financial services, Jane Hume, urging them to commission an independent review of the legislation that governs financial products, with the view to developing more effective regulation. “Because these companies operate outside of the national credit code, there are no legal requirements to assess a person’s ability to repay, nor are they required to have proper hardship procedures in place if people find themselves struggling,” the letter states. An earlier letter sent by the organisation in December urging better regulation received no formal response. A spokesperson for Hume said on Thursday that while the minister had not received a formal request for a meeting she would welcome an approach to discuss “this important sector and the issues raised”. Hume and the Treasury had “worked constructively with FCA as valued stakeholders and will continue to do so into the future”. “The Morrison government values the vital community work undertaken by financial counsellors, a sector that has been vital in Australia’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “Over the past two years, the government has allocated more than $7m to FCA, reaffirming their important role in supporting the financial well-being of Australians.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Hunt said “there’s a bigger picture here”. “We know a lot of people are feeling stuck financially, forced to take on debt,” he said. “People need more adequate and empowering income support, not more fintech companies preying on their financial vulnerability.” Tenanting’s fee schedule is more aggressive than some other companies offering similar financial products targeted at renters. RentPay, an offshoot of rental listings site Rent.com.au, bills itself as a long-term flexible payment planning service for renters. But it also offers a product called Safetynet, which allows the renter to draw a short-term line of credit to the total of one week’s rent, which they can then repay over four instalments. Each missed repayment accrues a $15 fee. RentPay also offers rental bond loans that don’t accrue interest if they are paid back within 21 days. The company told Guardian Australia, however, that 80% of its customers who received one of these loans did not repay within that timeframe.

I don’t think we take advantage of any loopholes or push people into debt spirals. I think the flexibility we offer in the product actually helps people manage their money better.” Bader said Safetynet was developed in response to customer demand as an emergency mechanism. “It’s not there to be used for an everyday thing.” In a statement, a spokesperson for Tenanting said: “We provide tenants with a flexible payment option to pay rent as a better alternative to predatory payday lenders. We are decentralising the rental system and putting control back in the hands of the Australian public.” Leo Patterson Ross from the Tenants’ Union told Guardian Australia the rental payments system could do with more flexibility for tenants, especially those with variable incomes, but BNPL-style schemes were “not the way to do that”. “The people who are most likely to have financial pressures that push them to a solution like this are the kind who are least able to ride those extra payments, so it’s least in their interests,” Patterson Ross said. In many states in Australia, unless a tenant is frequently late with rent, those who fall into arrears can retain their tenancy if they pay the rent in full before an eviction date, often even in cases where a tribunal has made an eviction order. State governments also offer hardship provisions and, in some cases, bond loans for renters who are struggling to come up with large lump sums at short notice. “The key here is that there’s no interest paid on that amount,” said Patterson Ross. “Australia can generally do better in bringing in hardship protections for people who are in some kind of financial strife – but they don’t need to borrow the money from [for-profit] lenders like this. And if they do, it’s a sign that the amount of support we have in place for them isn’t sufficient.” Frydenberg has been contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,"Buy now, pay later schemes for Australian renters ‘prey on vulnerable’, financial counsellors warn",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/buy-now-pay-later-schemes-for-australian-renters-prey-on-vulnerable-financial-counsellors-warn
2/4/2022,"The warring New South Wales Liberal factions have taken time out from actively trying to solve their preselection woes to try to lower the temperature in the fractured party following the leaking of text messages critical of the prime minister. With Scott Morrison’s threat of a federal intervention now public, the factions are expected to regroup over the weekend ahead of a last-ditch attempt to finalise who will be endorsed in eight winnable federal lower house seats and the third Senate spot.  “We need some alternative thinking,” one factional organiser told Guardian Australia. The NSW president, Philip Ruddock, wants the factions to come up with a negotiated solution. “A champion team always beats a team of champions,” he said while refusing to speculate how the impasse could be resolved. Liberal party rules require 90% support from the 27-strong state executive. This requires all three factions to agree – and for the factions to in turn get their own members to toe the line. The right has championed plebiscites which give branch members a greater say in preselections – and some feel very strongly democracy must be honoured. A limited midweek resolution to automatically endorse the current ministers Sussan Ley in Farrer and Alex Hawke in Mitchell, and the sitting MP Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney, failed. It was defeated 16-7 by a combination of the left and right factions who wanted to preserve their bargaining position on the remaining seats. Zimmerman, appearing on ABC TV on Thursday afternoon, stated the obvious – that the clock was ticking ahead of the federal election expected in May. “I really don’t want to talk about the internals of the NSW division to any great extent,” he said. “But what I’d say is it is obviously important that we do have candidates in the field as quickly as possible. I’m sure a lot of work has been done to achieve that outcome.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Zimmerman would not speculate on who leaked damaging texts allegedly sent between the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian and an unnamed federal cabinet minister. In the testy exchange, Morrison was referred to as “a horrible, horrible person” and a “complete psycho”. “I think it does become a bit of a political parlour game,” the North Sydney MP said. “People will speculate but I suspect [Network Ten journalist] Peter van Onselen will keep his source to himself and we’ll never know the truth of where this has emerged from or the context in which it happened.” Moderate sources suggested the faction was ready to support a compromise deal that would see Ley, the environment minister, Hawke, the immigration minister, and Zimmermann protected from any challenge with preselection ballots in all other seats except Hughes.

Of particular concern to some members of the executive is a plan to parachute Young Liberal Alex Dore, from Manly, into the southern Sydney seat of Hughes, held by the maverick rightwinger Craig Kelly who quit the party to become an independent. The lack of local input into choosing candidates – Kelly was also parachuted in – has deeply angered southern Sydney-based Liberals from all factions. The seat is under threat from the independent movement campaigning partly on a platform that Hughes needs local representation in line with the electorate’s values. One senior right figure said Dore as the pick for Hughes was a “non-negotiable” within any deal. Dore was originally from the moderates but is the nephew of Chris Dore, the editor-in -chief of the Australian newspaper. He is close to the former rightwing broadcaster Alan Jones, who loomed large over NSW politics for 30 years. The other seat that remains controversial is Dobell, with Morrison supporting Jemima Gleeson, a Pentecostal preacher, for the seat and the right backing Dr Michael Feneley, a cardiologist who has previously run in Kingsford Smith. There have been persistent rumours but no official confirmation that Gleeson is no longer running. If Hawke’s centre-right faction supported the compromise deal, the state executive could potentially achieve the 90% majority needed to override plebiscites in certain seats by using special powers. Under these provisions, the NSW state executive can override preselection processes if it deems it “imperative to campaign effectively for an imminent election”. If factional powerbrokers cannot agree to the deal, then two options remain: the “nuclear option” of federal intervention, which is unpopular and would be open to legal challenge, or allowing preselections to happen in all seats, which would see Ley sacrificed.",News/Australia news,Warring NSW Liberal factions take time out after text leak ahead of last-ditch preselection talks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/warring-nsw-liberal-factions-take-time-out-after-text-leak-ahead-of-last-ditch-preselection-talks
2/4/2022,"The opening ceremony is set to be staged on Friday, 4 February, from 11pm AEDT at Beijing’s National Stadium, and run until the closing ceremony at the same venue on Sunday, 20 February from 1pm AEDT.  In keeping with tradition, competition has already started with the curling and luge under way. Australia’s very first curling team, Tahli Gill and Dean Hewitt, lost their opening two round-robin matches on Wednesday and Thursday. Australian Alexander Ferlazzo also completed two luge training runs overnight. The short answer is Beijing, which is the first city to host both a summer and winter Games following the 2008 summer Olympics. Those who remember the famous “Water Cube” which hosted the swimming in 2008 will this time be treated to the “Ice Cube” – the pool has been converted into a four-sheet curling rink. The slightly longer answer is that there are three cluster sites: one in Beijing proper and two others in the nearby mountainous regions of Yanqing and Zhangjiakou. Yanqing is a northern suburban district about 80km from the city centre. The Zhangjiakou zone in the neighbouring province of Hebei is about 220km from central Beijing. The Guardian will be extensively live blogging each day of the Games, while the action will be broadcast by Channel 7 and streamed on 7 Plus. Curling is among the earliest sports to get under way each day, from 8:35am local time – 11:35am AEDT, as Beijing is three hours behind AEDT. About 2,800 athletes from 90 countries are expected to compete across 15 disciplines: alpine skiing, biathlon, bobsleigh, cross-country skiing, curling, figure skating, freestyle skiing, ice hockey, luge, nordic combined, short-speed skating, skeleton, ski jumping, snowboarding and speed skating. A total 109 gold medals are there to be won following the addition of seven new events: women’s monobob (an individual version of bobsleigh), men’s and women’s big air and mixed team events in speed skating, ski jumping, aerials and snowboard cross. Norway, according to sports statistics organisation Gracenote. It predicts – unsurprisingly – that the Nordic nation will win 45 medals including 21 golds, which would surpass its record-breaking total of 39 medals won at Pyeongchang in 2018. Russia and Germany are slated to take home 30 medals apiece. Gracenote predicts Australia will win three gold medals and one bronze, and a 15th-place finish on its virtual medal table. This would be a solid improvement on past Games, the most recent a 23rd place at PyeongChang with two silver medals and one bronze. Australia has won 15 medals across the last seven Games (five gold, five silver, five bronze) dating back to 1994. Before that the country had not won a single medal since 1936 when it first contested the Winter Olympics. A contingent of 43 athletes, the nation’s third-largest in history and featuring the strongest female representation to date with 22 women and 21 men, who will compete in 10 of the 15 disciplines. Of those 43 there are 19 debutants. The oldest member of the team is 33-year-old Sami Kennedy-Sim and the youngest 16-year-old Valentino Guseli. Scotty James is the big-ticket name in the halfpipe against American rival and three-time Olympic champion Shaun White. The 27-year-old was Australia’s flagbearer at the 2018 Games, at which he became the first Australian to win a Winter Olympics medal in snowboarding with bronze. Jarryd Hughes and Belle Brockhoff are 2021 mixed snowboard cross world champions and genuine contenders for gold in that event. Australia is among the western countries whose officials will not head to Beijing as part of a diplomatic boycott amid global criticism over China’s human rights record. Australia, whose diplomatic relationship with China has deteriorated significantly, cited the wide-scale repression of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in its northwestern region of Xinjiang. The Morrison government is following the lead of the US, Britain, Canada and Denmark, while Japan will not send officials but did not explicitly define the move as a diplomatic boycott. The New Zealand and Netherlands governments have also steered clear of calling their absence a boycott, saying they will not send government delegations because of China’s Covid-19 travel restrictions. Those world leaders who will be in attendance include Russia president Vladimir Putin, Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, among other Middle Eastern and central Asian countries. Generally in recent years there is at least a bit depending on weather conditions, but this will be the first time almost 100% of the snow used will be artificial. Before you ask yes, this is down to climate change, which has caused shorter winter seasons, less snowfall and melting ice. This was also a problem at the 2014 Games in Sochi, where snowboarders recall the halfpipe melting. There are some challenges with this. Artificial snow is icier than its natural counterpart, which could compromise safety, and there are also concerns about environmental damage. More than 100 snow generators and 300 snow-cannons will work to to cover the slopes but Chinese organisers say the machines will use 20% less water. They also insist the Games will be carbon neutral. That means venues powered by renewable energy, ice rinks using natural CO2 technology for cooling, instead of ozone-damaging hydrofluorocarbons. There was, however, a surprise dump of real snow earlier in the week. Authorities have pledged unrestricted internet access for foreign athletes at the Olympics, a rare break in the so-called Great Firewall of China that blocks access to popular messaging apps, social media platforms, search engines and websites deemed a threat to national security. But technology experts have warned that using Chinese WiFi services to connect to apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter or YouTube will leave visitors susceptible to surveillance. Australia is among a number of NOCs who have advised athletes to use burner phones to safeguard their privacy and security against the Chinese government and to leave their personal electronic devices at home. The US, British, Canadian and Dutch Olympic associations have issued similar advice. Human rights and athlete advocacy groups have also warned competitors could put themselves in danger if they speak out in support of the Uyghur Muslims and used the case of tennis player Peng Shuai as an example of the potential consequences of speaking out. This is where surveillance and the pandemic may overlap. China is utilising technology as a primary means of controlling the spread of coronavirus, through contact tracing apps, drones and robots. Robots will be used to transport equipment between venues, ensure social distancing and sanitise areas, while robot chefs will prepare and serve some of the food to athletes and delegates. All visitors to the Winter Olympics will be subject to artificial intelligence, predictive policing, Big Data databases and extensive surveillance of social media platforms, which Human Rights Watch says constitutes an “Orwellian surveillance state”. Also in place will be a “closed loop”, also known as a biosecurity bubble. All athletes, officials and media will be separated entirely from locals, staying in hotels inside the “loop” and required to be tested daily and sometimes twice daily. Volunteers and Beijing residents working at the Games face three weeks of quarantine before returning to their homes. Despite the regulations, organisers are hoping for stadium capacities of at least 30%. Tickets will be distributed to targeted groups of people, though it is still unclear who those people will be. Those who do attend will be required to undertake strict Covid-19 prevention measures.",Sport/Sport,"Beijing Winter Olympics: if you’re watching from Australia, here’s what you need to know",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/beijing-winter-olympics-if-youre-watching-from-australia-heres-what-you-need-to-know
2/4/2022,"The principal of a Brisbane school that demanded families sign anti-gay and anti-trans enrolment contracts previously lobbied senators to allow employers “the right to discriminate” against homosexuals. Citipointe Christian College principal Brian Mulheran, a Pentecostal pastor who has led the school for four years, does not hold teaching qualifications or registration, Guardian Australia can reveal.  While such qualifications are not required by principals in independent schools, a group of furious parents is now calling for Mulheran to be sacked over his attempt to introduce the contracts. Mulheran released a statement on Thursday saying the school would withdraw demands that parents sign enrolment contracts that called homosexual acts “immoral” and “offensive to God”, and implied transgender students would not be recognised at the college. Mulheran said the college “does and will not” discriminate against students on the basis of sexuality or gender identity, but that it will continue to assert its “freedom” to maintain its Christian ethos and beliefs. “It is central to our faith that being gay or transgender in no way diminishes a person’s humanity or dignity in God’s eyes.” But parents and teachers who spoke to Guardian Australia on Thursday said the withdrawal of the contracts did not address their underlying concerns about the direction of the school. Guardian Australia has learned that in 1996, Mulheran, then a pastor at the Christian Outreach Centre (which became Citipointe), gave evidence to a Senate hearing on sexuality discrimination. In his evidence, recorded in Hansard, he said homosexuality was an “immoral act” and argued that business owners should be allowed to discriminate against gay people. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We have children whom we love and care about, and we do not want to allow them to be taught wrong morals and be influenced by wrong moral behaviour,” he said. “Our children should not have to bear the brunt because of legislation that forces an immoral situation. People who employ other people … should have the right to discriminate (against homosexuals).” The Queensland College of Teachers has no record of Mulheran – who holds degrees in science and theology – in its database. Registration with the teachers’ college is a requirement for all Queensland classroom teachers in state and non-state schools. Most principals also have teaching experience, training and accreditation – though it is not a legal requirement for principals of independent schools. In a statement, a group of 23 parents has called on Mulheran and the school board to resign. “We are still deeply concerned that those responsible for the catastrophe that has unfolded this week, the principal Brian Mulheran and the governing board members, remain in their positions,” a statement from the group said.

She said the actions of the school showed exactly what could happen if the federal parliament passed a proposed religious freedom bill. Corrine McMillan, the local state MP for Mansfield, and a former state school principal, said families in the community “would absolutely expect that the school they send their child to is led by experienced and qualified educators”. “We have 19 schools in the Mansfield electorate. We don’t have cane farms or iron ore mines – what we produce is education,” McMillan said. “Just as very few people would trust an unqualified surgeon to operate on them, there aren’t many parents who would knowingly entrust their child’s education to anyone but a professional, qualified educator.” The Queensland education minister, Grace Grace, welcomed the withdrawal of the enrolment contract. “Comparing homosexuality to things like bestiality, paedophilia and incest is nothing short of abhorrent. In the interests of the mental health of students, staff, carers, parents, and indeed anyone impacted by this, I hope they abandon it completely and nothing like it ever surfaces again.” Mulheran did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment.",News/Australia news,Citipointe Christian College principal lobbied senators for ‘right to discriminate’ against gay people,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/citipointe-christian-college-principal-lobbied-senators-for-right-to-discriminate-against-gay-people
2/4/2022,"Iwas on a walk with my friend Ivan, talking about the time I had Covid, and how it was bad but not too bad, and on the bright side at least now I had some antibodies, before he interrupted me and said: “You didn’t have it.” “What? I didn’t have Covid? Yes I did!”  “No you didn’t. You didn’t get a positive test.” “I couldn’t get a test.” “So you don’t know you had it – and therefore you can’t say you had it.” “But I was sick. I had all the symptoms.” “It was probably a cold.” “You weren’t there. What are you, a pathologist?” And so on. I’ve had this fight with a few different people. They are Covid deniers … as in, they are denying that I had Covid. Like a lot of people, I reckon I caught the virus in early January during the perfect storm of the Omicron wave, mass infections, an unprepared government and a stressed and broken testing regime. I had gone to a Melbourne wedding that was held indoors – and two days following the event, the bride’s step-dad and the groom’s father, as well as various cousins and friends, all got Covid. And so did I – or so I thought. Their symptoms were similar to mine: a scratchy throat, muscle aches, fatigue, a cough. But I tested negative on my one and only RAT, no other RATs were available and I didn’t have access to PCR testing. It left me wondering – if you had been to a super-spreader event, could you assume a positive result by proxy? It was the epidemiological equivalent of that philosophical conundrum: “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” If you were exposed to the virus and had the symptoms, but no one is around to test you, did you have Covid? I was not alone in believing I had Covid but lacking the proof to back up my claim. When the Omicron wave hit in late December and early January suddenly half the people I knew were sick – but half of those people, with all the classic Covid symptoms were testing negative on RATs or couldn’t get RATs or had PCR test results delayed and then voided or were testing negative on as many RATs as they could get their hands on, but positive on PCR tests. Or negative on four or five RATs until they stuck a swab right down their throat and then got a positive result. It was a confusing time – the predictable extension of what happens when the government pivots sharply to personal responsibility – making everyone into their own mini-health department of one, and tasked with having to take over the detection, management, treatment and reporting of the virus. Last week news.com.au political reporter Samantha Maiden tweeted, “Has anyone else in Melbourne or elsewhere experienced a strange phenomenon where they have lots of Covid symptoms – sore throat, spots on throat, extreme fatigue, nausea but test negative? Including via PCR?” In the more than 1,500 replies, the answer was overall a resounding “Yes”. For those of us who were sick but lacked a positive result it could have been ineffective tests or some other illness such as a cold – but I got to thinking that maybe some people, including myself, could have been suffering from a variation of Havana syndrome. Havana syndrome was named after the mysterious illnesses, experienced by CIA officers around the world and originally thought to be a result of the use of biological weapons, but later thought to be a form of mass hysteria and a psychosomatic illness, to eventually – as of this week – found to probably be a bit of both. The victims of Havana syndrome reported a variety of symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, hearing loss, fatigue, mental fog and difficulty concentrating after hearing an eerie sound. But after extensive testing, nothing came up. According to Professor ​​Robert Baloh, writing for the Conversation in September, “Mass psychogenic illness typically begins in a stressful environment. Sometimes it starts when an individual with an unrelated illness believes something mysterious caused their symptoms. This person then spreads the idea to the people around them and even to other groups.” In my case, I had been writing about Covid for two years and it had so completely taken over my psychic, physical (restrictions and lockdowns) and online landscapes, that when a real life situation (a wedding in a closed room with 75 people) occurred where it might be likely to catch it, I was probably psychosomatically primed to think I would get Covid. In fact, at the wedding reception, several of the guests said they had feared they might catch the virus at the event and so had cleared their schedule for the next couple of weeks to allow them to recover. This week, a report by a panel of expert scientists named pulsed electromagnetic energy and ultrasound as plausible causes for the mystery Havana syndrome symptoms but said that psychosocial factors could have worsened symptoms. Such factors could also explain other incidents which “could be due to hypervigilance and normal human reactions to stress and ambiguity, particularly among a workforce attuned to its surroundings and trained to think about security”. That all sounds pretty familiar.",Opinion/Opinion,"Omicron felled me, but like the unheard tree in the forest I couldn’t prove it | Brigid Delaney",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/omicron-felled-me-but-like-the-unheard-tree-in-the-forest-i-couldnt-prove-it
2/4/2022,"How will history record these years when the pandemic is finally over? How will our children start the story, when they tell their grandchildren about the great pandemic of the 2020s? They’ll surely include tales of the months we could not leave our homes, of the empty toilet paper shelves in supermarkets, and the years when we reached for a mask when we went out, as instinctively as reaching for the keys.  But death will lead the stories. That’s what we have been afraid of, either personally, or for vulnerable friends and family. That’s our collective trauma. More than 5.7 million deaths around the world so far. More than 5,900 in Australia. Somehow though, right in the thick of it, it’s not what we’re talking about. It may be because we’re so busy coping day to day, taking one step at a time and not planning or thinking about what Covid-19 variant lies around the corner. But it’s also because the discussion of death is conducted with statistics; numbers and graphs without human names and faces attached to them. If we are not directly affected, or frontline workers, it happens out of sight. When governments were trying to persuade us to stay at home they brought weary health workers to press conferences and occasionally allowed reporters into hospitals. Now we’ve been moved on to the “personal responsibility” phase, we get the bare figures, written to a formula. “Unfortunately X people in New South Wales lost their lives, including X in their 90s and X in their 80s.” Even when Omicron tore through the nation and the death toll climbed alarmingly higher, we didn’t really confront it. We were all supposed to be getting used to “living with Covid”, just as more Australians were dying. I note this not to dismiss the importance of statistics, nor to stoke fear, and certainly not to argue for a return to lockdowns. But it is important that human stories are not diminished or obscured by the numbers. Stories inspire compassion. They force decision makers to take responsibility. Which brings me back to the deft deployment of numbers. At its mildest it happens with the daily report on how many of the dead had “underlying conditions”, possibly as a signal to healthy people to worry a bit less. The Omicron variant is milder. But the term “underlying conditions” covers ailments suffered by millions, and as the Burnet Institute’s director Prof Brendan Crabb pointed out, what distinction are we really trying to draw? Just because someone has “underlying conditions” doesn’t mean their death is less tragic. More overt are the politicians hiding behind statistics when faced with the rising death toll, particularly the crisis in aged care. The minister for aged care services, Richard Colbeck, when challenged about the obscene absence of those services at a make-up parliamentary committee after he skipped the last one to attend the cricket, insisted the sector was performing “extremely well”. And yes, he backed that extraordinary assertion with statistics. As political reporter Paul Karp wrote, Colbeck noted in 2020 there were 28,000 Covid cases in Australia, of which 2,051 were in aged care (7.2%), but now of the 1.8m cases, just 10,500 were in aged care (0.58%). He didn’t add that those “just” 10,500 cases have resulted in 650 deaths since last July. The health minister, Greg Hunt, sought refuge in a different set of numbers when asked about aged care mortality. “I think an important piece of information as well, the latest advice that I have is that approximately 60% of those that have agonisingly passed have been in palliative care,” he said. Medical editor Melissa Davey reported this week that aged care and health workers considered it pretty disrespectful to appear to rationalise that the elderly patients were going to die anyway. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, goes even further, trying to claim credit for people who haven’t died. “We have saved 40,000 lives based on looking at the average among the OECD,” he says whenever he can possibly fit it into an interview, a comparison skewed by Australia’s relatively lower death rate in the first years of the pandemic. Early in the pandemic Guardian Australia began a series called Lives Lost to Covid, to record the stories of those who had died, when their families and friends were ready to tell them. We wanted to know about their loves and losses and idiosyncrasies and adventures. This week reporter Tory Shepherd has returned to the series, recounting the life of Sue Rees as remembered by her daughter Bec. Whatever history makes of these Covid years, people like Sue must be part of the story.",News/Australia news,Politicians are hiding behind numbers as Covid deaths rise.

2/4/2022,"The majority of Australians would support restoring funding to the ABC, according to a new poll, after new figures showed funding has been cut by $526m since the Coalition’s first budget. The poll of 1,000 voters conducted by the Australia Institute found that 52% want the $84m cut from the ABC in the last three years to be restored, more than double those who oppose it (25%).  Despite being elected after promising no cuts to the ABC and SBS, the Abbott government reduced funding to the ABC in the 2014 budget, with a further pause in the indexation of funding imposed in 2018 under Malcolm Turnbull. There have been $526m in cuts to the ABC budget since 2014, with an ongoing reduction to base funding of $106m per year by 2021-22, the ABC has told Senate estimates in reply to questions on notice. In that time, the ABC has slashed 640 jobs, from 4,704 staff to 4,064. In addition to staff cuts, the ABC’s savings have come from discontinuing the 7.45am radio news bulletin, reducing spending on independent production and discontinuing ABC Life. The poll shows despite a majority of voters backing increased ABC funding, the issue is polarised along party lines. Coalition voters narrowly favoured increased funding, with 43% in favour and 36% opposed, whereas Labor and Greens voters had solid majorities of 65% and 63% in favour and just 17% an 16% opposed. Support for more ABC funding is highest in Victoria (57% in favour) and New South Wales (54%), whereas in Queensland 44% wanted increased funding and 29% were opposed. The Australia Institute poll found that 61% of respondents agreed that “a strong, independent ABC is critical to a healthy democracy” with only 19% disagreeing. In the 2021 budget the Morrison government gave an extra $30m to SBS, but the ABC copped a $10m reduction in its operational funding from $880.56m in 2021-22 to $870.34m in 2022-23. In 2020 the independent thinktank Per Capita did a report for progressive lobby group GetUp estimating that total funding cuts to the ABC totalled $783m since 2014. Labor has pledged to protect the ABC and SBS against “arbitrary ideological cuts and political interference” by granting the public broadcasters funding in five-year cycles. Australia Institute senior research, Bill Browne, said “Australians depend on the ABC for quality news reporting, emergency broadcasting and documentaries, drama and comedy that tell Australian stories”. “Cuts to the ABC undermine its truth-telling mission, cost hundreds of people their jobs and mean Australians miss out on quality broadcasting,” he said. “The ABC is an essential part of Australia’s democracy and accountability infrastructure. “The government could start by restoring and increasing ABC funding for its next three-year funding cycle, coming in July.”",News/Media,Coalition has slashed $526m from ABC – and most Australians want funding restored,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/04/coalition-has-slashed-526m-from-abc-and-most-australians-want-funding-restored
2/4/2022,"Afamily member of mine (who, out of embarrassment, wishes to remain anonymous) recently had an incident of the pongiest proportions. It involved a two-litre bottle of milk mistakenly left in her car for an entire weekend in the hot summer sun. The result: an explosion that covered the front passenger side of her car in milk that curdled and seeped into the upholstery. Along with the maggots that wriggled out from her carpet, it left a foul, pungent smell that would just not go away.  While it isn’t always a detonating milk carton, most of us have been in a similar situation – one that leaves a lingering stink in our car. Professional crime scene cleaner and the director of Clean Queens, Gabrielle Simpson, says the most common bad smells in cars are from spilt takeaway coffee, or windows left down after rain which leads to excess moisture in a car’s carpets and fabrics. The hot, wet weather much of Australia is experiencing certainly isn’t helping keep that new car smell either. Simon Cook, who is a partner at Star Car Wash, says that bacteria in the air conditioner unit, cigarette smoke, body sweat, stale food left in difficult-to-locate crevices or any liquid or wet food spillage – especially milk and seafood – are also quite common sources of stink. “Always clean the contaminant before it gets the opportunity to generate an odour,” he says. But if the smell has already set in, Simpson says you should “remove, wash and rinse out the cause of the smell. This usually means a steam clean machine and high-powered wet and dry vacuum.” Importantly, do not just mask the smell. “Using any type of masking spray is just that, it will mask a smell it will not eliminate it,” she says. To effectively remove a bad smell, you need to look at what exactly is causing it and where it is, then employ the right strategy depending on the source. If you are a pet owner or carer, it’s always better to protect the car interior than to remedy the smell. Seat and floor coverings can help with this. But if the damage is already done, Cook’s advice is to “steam clean where the damp hairs are more readily removed from the upholstery. At home, a vacuum with a power head can help.” Mop up the milk or coffee as soon as possible, preferably with an absorbent paper towel or microfibre cloth. Blot the stain rather than rubbing it, as rubbing can cause the liquid to penetrate further into the fabric. After this, “the most effective process is to use a powerful extraction system to suck out the liquid. It will be also necessary to rinse the area with water to thoroughly flush the milk from where it has been,” Cook says. This could be done at home with an enzyme-based cleaner, or through a professional service. For set milk stains, Cook suggests a steam cleaning tool to break down the hardened residue. “In some cases, it may be necessary to remove the affected seats and carpet in order to gain access to where the milk has run.” Whether it’s sweat, vomit or something else, accidents happen – especially if you have kids. “Safe removal of any excess fluids off a carpet or upholstery is a start,” Simpson says. “Diluting a small amount of ammonia with water and patting it over the fabric or carpet will help break down any protein out. Apply pressure to the spill using something super absorbent like a towel.” But if you don’t have the time, or just want the best outcome, Simpson recommends engaging a carpet and upholstery cleaner to steam clean and deodorise the fabrics and carpets. The smell of cigarettes is often the trickiest to remove, because the smoke particles can reside nearly anywhere within a car. The managing director at All Aces Cleaning and Restoration, James Wright, suggests using sugar soap on the hard surfaces, and recommends changing the air filter of your car. “It is inexpensive and easy to replace.” But the odour can still sometimes hang around, in inaccessible locations within the car. If this is the case, the help of a professional car cleaner is probably required. “The process usually involves a complete detail where every internal surface is either wiped down or steam cleaned,” says Cook. Mould occurs when fungal microbes meet spilled liquid or dropped food on an interior surface and begin to grow. “The best option is to wipe away any of the mouldy patches with an anti-bacterial product. This should also include steam cleaning all fabrics,” says Cook. This is because “the heat helps kill the spores”. “The most important final process is to then let the car fully dry with the doors open before use.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Don’t cry over spilt milk: how to deal with a smelly car,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/04/dont-cry-over-spilt-milk-how-to-deal-with-a-smelly-car
2/4/2022,"Refugees previously held in detention on Nauru have turned down the chance of a US visa because their partners – also accepted as refugees – have been denied permission to join them. Under its deal with the Australian government in 2016, the US agreed to resettle up to 1,250 refugees who had been held in Australia’s offshore system on Nauru or Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island.  But the US does not guarantee that family members of anyone accepted for resettlement will also be granted a visa, and lawyers advocating for refugees in Australia say anyone with a temporary or permanent Australian visa is almost always rejected. Lara*, who fled Iran in 2013 and was on Nauru for more than five years, said she had refused her US medical examination after receiving an email from the US Resettlement Support Center confirming that her partner Parham* would not be allowed to join her. Lara declared her relationship to the Australian government in 2014 and began living with Parham in 2015. Their protection claims, which were logged separately, were approved in 2015 and subsequently both were recognised as refugees on Nauru. In 2018 Parham’s application was denied on the grounds that he had failed to “establish that you meet the definition of refugee” under US law. Lara’s application was also denied, but she successfully appealed, while his appeal was rejected. “I feel like I am swimming in a tsunami and can’t wait to flee persecution in Australia, but not without my partner,” Lara said. Lara was evacuated from Nauru to Brisbane for Parham’s medical treatment in 2019. Parham was granted a bridging visa in 2020 while she was kept on a community detention visa. Because they have different visa types they are forbidden to live together. Guardian Australia is aware of at least two other cases where refugees have turned down the possibility of US resettlement because it was clear their partner or other family members would be unable to join them. Josephine Langbien, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said it had often been difficult for people to obtain clear information about the US resettlement process, and forcing people to choose between their family and permanent resettlement was “an unthinkable cruelty”. “Our understanding is that in the past, many people with permanent or temporary protection visas in Australia were told they were ineligible for resettlement in the US, regardless of whether their family members are eligible,” Langbien said. “This is an entirely unfair distinction, especially because many families were initially separated between Australia and offshore detention by the arbitrary date when offshore processing was reintroduced in 2013. That government decision could now potentially separate some families permanently.

Because of the lack of transparency, it is difficult to know how often this is happening in practice. But if this option was widely available to refugee families regardless of visa status, it would be an important and positive development. She said people resettled in the US were also entitled to apply for family reunion once they arrived – but only for their partners or dependent children. That also meant they would have to go through another bureaucratic process and wait even longer to reunite with their family, Langbien said. Nasreen, 62, a Hazara refugee whose story has been reported previously by Guardian Australia also rejected her second US interview as her husband, Mohammad, is not authorised to join her. Nasreen fled Afghanistan with her children in 2013 to join Mohammad in Australia. He was recognised as a refugee in 2012 and holds a permanent visa. She was transferred from Nauru to Australia for medical care in 2014 and was admitted to a mental health hospital. Mohammad has never been permitted to live with his family in Sydney due to holding different classes of visa. “After four years of separation from my children who were on Nauru, now the government wants to split me from my husband who is also my carer. It is not resettlement, but a forced separation for an elderly woman with multiple disabilities and in need of extensive support,” she said. Principal solicitor at the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, Carolyn Graydon, said accepting resettlement in the US risked permanent separation for such families. “To be reunited with their families, they have to start all over with lengthy US family reunion processes, which are far from certain and still depend on the individual circumstances in every case and take years of processing. The Australian government has never made an effort to keep families together. These are the cruel, direct consequences of government policy,” Graydon said. A spokesperson for Australia’s department of home affairs said details of the US resettlement process were “matters for the US”. “We understand the US intends to return to Australia and Nauru in February 2022, subject to Covid-19 restrictions, to finalise resettlement interviews,” they said. As of May last year the cap on refugees accepted under the deal had almost been reached, with 936 refugees resettled and a further 258 provisionally approved. By 31 October the number accepted had risen to 990.
