4/12/2022,"“Ihaven’t been in court for a few years so excuse me if I’m a bit rusty,” said Doug Emhoff. “You know, not too much has changed in my life except for the Secret Service, Air Force Two, the selfies, the cameras following me everywhere and oh: my wife is the vice-president of the United States.” The theatre erupted in whoops and clapping. Kamala Harris, sitting in the fifth row with her sister Maya, blew kisses through a black face mask and applauded her husband. It was one of those only-in-Washington moments. On Monday, the Shakespeare Theatre Company hosted a “mock trial” inspired by William Shakespeare’s romantic comedy Much Ado About Nothing and presided over by retiring supreme court justice and good sport Stephen Breyer. Much Ado is best known for Beatrice and Benedick, two proud intellects who only fall in love after others play Cupid. That seemed fitting for Harris and Emhoff, who were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend and married just shy of their 50th birthdays. But the question before the not-so-serious court was: should Margaret be held liable for Don John’s defamation of Hero? Emhoff, who was a prominent entertainment lawyer for nearly 30 years, was lead advocate on Margaret’s behalf. The event, full of inside-the-beltway topical gags, had been due to take place last month but was postponed after the second gentleman came down with coronavirus. “I thank your honours for granting my motion for a continuance due to plague,” began Emhoff, wearing dark suit, blue shirt and blue tie and standing at a lectern under bright stage lights. “The White House apothecary told me my symptoms would be wild but – whew!” The mock trial is a longstanding Shakespeare Theatre Company tradition but had gone virtual for the past couple of years, due to the pandemic. Monday marked a return to an in-person audience at the Sidney Harman Hall but it was also livestreamed. Emhoff, an amiable and slightly goofy presence, remarked: “My parents tonight are watching the livestream but I might have told them that I was arguing in front of the United States supreme court so, cameraperson, can you just keep a very tight shot…?” The second gentleman faced quick-fire questioning from Breyer and four leading judges from the District of Columbia and Virginia. “How do you define woman?” asked one, a nod to the recent esoteric questioning of the supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson by Republican senators. Tongue firmly in cheek, Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was interested in Beatrice and Benedick. “He says he doesn’t want to marry anyone but I think it’s clear from the text that his real concern is that if he marries somebody who’s really pretty and is really smart and witty, she could turn out to be the one who is better known and more prominent than he is.” There was laughter from the audience. There was more when Emhoff responded dryly: “As I say, your honour, I used to be somebody.” The judges – relishing a chance to let their hair down – also made references to Will Smith’s slap of Chris Rock at the Oscars, Britney Spears’s conservatorship, Downton Abbey, Republicans Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Emhoff was careful not get too political. One judge asked: “So when Beatrice tore up her love letters, making them unavailable to investigators, was that a violation of the imperial records act? If so, is Merrick Garland going to get around to that?” The second gentleman demurred: “There’s certain things I’m not allowed to talk about.” But he did take a deft swipe at Donald Trump’s oldest son, during his defence of Margaret. “She was just an unwitting pawn in the scheme of the real villain here, the self-described villain: Don Jr – I mean, Don John.” The case against Margaret was put by Debra Katz, a DC litigator and founding partner of Katz, Marshall & Banks. The judges and the theatre audience ruled in her favour, whereas the audience watching via livestream sided with Emhoff. Harris then took to the stage, gave Emhoff a hug, posed for photos and and spoke with those assembled including Britain’s Simon Godwin, artistic director of the Shakespeare Theatre Company. Someone managed to get a selfie with Emhoff before the Secret Service trod the boards and encouraged Harris to exit, stage right.",News/US news,Much ado about Doug: second gentleman takes spotlight at Shakespeare debate,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/much-ado-doug-emhoff-shakespeare-debate-kamala-harris
4/12/2022,"The intervention by Crispin Blunt to attempt to taint a court’s verdict of sexual assault against the former Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan will put the apparent culture of impunity at the Palace of Westminster in the spotlight again. While the #MeToo scandal led to major reforms to try to protect staff members and parliamentary aides from bullying and abuse, there have been multiple attempts over the past few years to cast aspersions on those seeking justice. Three Conservative MPs in recent years have been found by courts to have committed sexual assault or rape, two of them with character references provided by fellow Conservatives. Throughout the trial, Ahmad Khan sought to block reporting of the case in which a jury found he had plied a teenager with alcohol and assaulted him. Blunt, a former justice minister, said he had been prepared to give evidence to defend Ahmad Khan, but according to reporters who covered the trial, he had not attended for the prosecution’s case, where the victim’s parents were said to have been reduced to tears describing the effect of the assault on their teenage boy. Blunt attended only for the defence and summing up. But he was not the only Tory MP to come to Ahmad Khan’s aid. Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the house, attended court on Monday, and another MP, Adam Holloway, provided a character statement used as part of Ahmad Khan’s defence. Blunt has apologised and resigned from the all-party parliamentary group on LGBT+ rights he chaired. But others have made similar interventions, sometimes without serious sanction. Natalie Elphicke, who took the parliamentary seat of her former Tory MP husband Charlie Elphicke when he was convicted of sexual assault, signed a witness statement calling his victim a liar, according to the Sunday Times. She remains a Tory vice-chair. Holloway was also among four Tory MPs described as a “protection racket” for Elphicke. Along with Natalie Elphicke, the MPs Sir Roger Gale, Theresa Villiers and Bob Stewart signed a letter – using parliamentary stationery – putting pressure on a senior judge to intervene to stop the publication of their character statements for Elphicke in his trial. The Commons standards committee called it “egregious behaviour … corrosive to the rule of law and, if allowed to continue unchecked, could undermine public trust in the independence of judges.” Victims have long complained that political convenience can trump complaints even at the very highest level. Charlie Elphicke was given the Tory whip back shortly before the vote of no confidence in Theresa May, as was the suspended MP Andrew Griffiths, who had sent a slew of inappropriate texts to young women. Griffiths was later found by a high court judge to have raped and abused his wife, in what the judge called “coercive and controlling behaviour”. Two other MPs, suspended from the party, are still in parliament despite serious allegations against them. David Warburton has been accused by three women of sexual harassment, as well as being pictured with what is said to be lines of cocaine. Rob Roberts, whose seat in Delyn, north Wales, would likely fall to Labour if he faced a recall, has continued sitting as an independent after refusing to step down despite being suspended from the Commons for six weeks last May for making repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards a former member of staff. Parliamentary technicalities have let Roberts off the hook of a recall petition –and though rules have now been changed they are conveniently not retrospective. By and large, it has been the Conservative party in the spotlight but Labour is not immune – the former MP Mike Hill was found by an employment tribunal to have repeatedly sexually assaulted and harassed a parliamentary staff member. In the case of Hill, Keir Starmer has shown he is prepared to take a politically difficult decision, forcing Hill to resign and call a byelection, in which the party lost the seat to the Conservatives. But at least one MP tried to intervene to help Hill, too. A tribunal heard how Kate Hollern, then a shadow communities minister and former aide to Jeremy Corbyn, attempted to dissuade the Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen from offering support to Hill’s staff member. And both parties have been accused of having intolerably slow internal complaints processes. The Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh waited three years for the party to investigate her claims against the then Labour shadow cabinet minister Kelvin Hopkins, which he denied and then quit before it could be concluded. In Ahmad Khan’s case, there remain serious questions about the complaint the victim said he made to the Conservative press office – of which it says there is no record – where he suggests the officer did not take any action when he told them about the police complaint shortly before the 2019 election. Dogged campaigning by victims, staffers and some committed MPs has meant significant reforms have taken place to help tackle the culture of impunity that was highlighted in the #MeToo scandal. But there remains a question about how many MPs are committed to that reform – and how many do believe their status as elected representatives gives them special privilege, even in matters of law.",News/Politics,Crispin Blunt’s defence of sex offender MP revives stench of impunity,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/crispin-blunt-defence-sex-offender-revives-stench-impunity
4/12/2022,"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are to receive fixed-penalty notices for breaching Covid laws after a police investigation into Downing Street parties during lockdown, No 10 has said. In an unprecedented development, the prime minister and his chancellor were both set to be fined for breaking their own emergency laws brought in to protect the country during the pandemic. No 10 would not say whether Johnson and Sunak would contest the fines – likely to be £20 or £50 – or pay them straight away. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on both Johnson and Sunak to resign. The fines relate to parties held in Downing Street during lockdown and are likely to include a gathering in the cabinet room for Johnson’s birthday in June 2020, which was also attended by Sunak. However, No 10 gave no details on how many events the prime minister will be fined for attending. A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister and chancellor of the Exchequer have today received notification that the Metropolitan police intend to issue them with fixed penalty notices. We have no further details, but we will update you again when we do.” It comes after the Met said it had issued more than 50 fines, with Starmer saying the “widespread criminality” called into question Boris Johnson’s honesty and integrity.The force has been investigating 12 gatherings, including some in the Downing Street garden, inside No 10, and one in the prime minister’s own residence at No 11. The fines are likely to prompt renewed speculation over Johnson’s leadership, after he faced a significant threat from his own party over the scandal earlier this year. Some Conservative MPs have previously said a line would be crossed by allowing a prime minister to remain in office if he is found to have broken the law. About 20-30 MPs were at one point thought to have submitted letters of no confidence in the prime minister, with 54 needed to trigger a leadership challenge. However, some have backed away from the idea of removing Johnson as leader since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, arguing now is not the time to change leader. People are referred by the police for fines to the Criminal Records Office (ACRO) if officers have a “reasonable belief” that the law has been broken. If Johnson and Sunak were to contest the fines, it would be likely to be dealt with via the single justice procedure in a magistrates court – behind closed doors as with thousands of other Covid fines imposed during lockdown.Starmer told the BBC: “This is further evidence that blows the PM’s defence out of the water. He told the country, he told parliament, that all the rules had been complied with in Downing Street., where he lives and works, and now it is obvious there was widespread criminality.“I’m afraid it calls into even further question the honesty and integrity of the prime minister, who stood up and said nothing was going on that shouldn’t have been going on. It’s obvious that was wrong and it reflects very badly on the prime minister.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak fined for breaking lockdown laws,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/boris-johnson-and-rishi-sunak-fined-for-breaking-covid-lockdown-laws
4/12/2022,"According to Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, the conviction of fellow MP Imran Ahmad Khan for child sexual assault was just based on “lazy tropes about LGBT+ people”. Amazing, really, that it was the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on LGBT+ issues who was the only person seemingly making a link between gay men and paedophilia in the wake of Khan being found guilty of assaulting a 15-year-old boy, after plying him with alcohol. I want to say “you had ONE job, Crispin”, but I see that among other things, the Reigate MP is a paid board member of a hotel group. So … you had SOME jobs, Crispin. But let’s be crystal clear here: none of them was you, a former minister of justice, claiming that child sexual assault was “an event that was minor on any scale”. In reality, the only minor involved was the victim. If you missed it, this is the story of the Wakefield MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, who has now been expelled from the Tory party after yesterday’s conviction at Southwark crown court. He will naturally be appealing and remaining as an MP while he does that – and we’ll come to the section on the expanding number of Commons crims in a bit. Anyway, once the guilty verdict came in, Crispin Blunt – that mangled instance of nominative determinism – opted not to shut up/pipe down/fail to chime in. Instead, Blunt decided that the case was “a dreadful miscarriage of justice”, and promptly posted a lengthy and clearly considered statement calling it “nothing short of an international scandal”. Even more boggling was the bit where Blunt described the entire business for Khan as “this nightmare start to his parliamentary career”. Start to it? A way of putting it that reminds us that once we’ve put this silly business of child sexual assault behind us, Imran should be expected to ascend swiftly toward at least the cabinet without further trifling impediment. Anyway. As of Tuesday morning, Blunt has quit his chairmanship of the APPG, after a spate of resignations looked like reducing its next meeting to a room empty but for the presence of Blunt and his self-regard. Admittedly, you would still need a room slightly larger than the vehicle assembly room at the Kennedy Space Centre, sometimes cited as the largest single chamber on Earth. But it also tells you something about the size of the shit sandwich that he has served himself that the eternally shameless Blunt has actually cottoned on that he has to quit and apologise for his comments. Unless there is something wildly askew with parliamentary ethics, he will be now be relieved of the Tory whip, ideally before I begin typing the next paragraph. And yet, I hate to break out the spoilers this soon, but I’m afraid there IS something wildly askew with parliamentary ethics. And, indeed, Westminster ethics beyond the chamber. Starting with those first, the victim explained that he contacted the Conservative press office before Khan was elected in Wakefield in 2019, and informed them that he had been sexually assaulted by him as a child, and that there was a police report of the matter. Nothing whatsoever seems to have been done. “I wasn’t taken very seriously,” he said. “She said, ‘Well … ’ and that’s it. I said, ‘I’m going to the police’ and she said, ‘Well, you do that.’” Blunt was not the only one to defend Khan. A character statement was provided to his defence by Adam Holloway, who you may recall also provided a character statement for former Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, who was convicted of sex offences against two women. Holloway was subsequently forced to apologise for his attempt to stop that statement being made public. Still, he is in … well, you wouldn’t call it good company, would you, but there is certainly a real little community of grotesques in the House of Commons. The Sunday Times wrote of the “protection racket” of MPs who propped up Elphicke before he was found guilty and imprisoned, including Holloway, Theresa Villiers, Bob Stewart and Roger Gale. Elphicke’s wife, Natalie, remains an MP in his former seat, despite having only recently signed a witness statement in which she accused one of the victims of his crimes of lying. Still want more? Tory MP David Warburton has just had the whip removed over multiple sexual assault allegations. In December, his colleague and former minister Andrew Griffiths was found by a high court judge to have repeatedly raped and abused his wife. Former Labour member Claudia Webbe remains an MP, despite having been handed a two-year suspended prison sentence for a campaign of harassment against a woman, with the trial hearing this had included the threat of an acid attack. Webbe’s appealing that, so she remains in the Commons. Any others? Hang on – Rob Roberts sits as an independent, despite having been found to have sexually harassed two members of his staff by an independent panel and the Tory party respectively, but was bafflingly given his Conservative membership back. Without wishing to go out on a limb here, this feels like … quite a lot? There are only 650 MPs. Is this a normal distribution of such abysmal and repulsive behaviour? Alas, here we are at the last paragraph, and I note Crispin Blunt still hasn’t been relieved of the whip. But the Metropolitan police has just confirmed it has now made more than 50 – FIFTY! – referrals for fixed-term penalty notices for lawbreaking Downing Street parties during lockdown. And No 10 confirms that two of those are for the actual prime minister and the actual chancellor. Just so endlessly, endlessly impressive. Then again, “most homes” and “most businesses” broke the law in the pandemic. We know this, because it was recently stated as fact by a hugely versatile authority figure. His name? Crispin Blunt.

4/12/2022,"An asylum seeker who stabbed six people before being shot dead by police had made more than 70 calls seeking help from the Home Office and its contractors, it has emerged. In June 2020, Badreddin Abadlla Adam was shot after he attacked a police officer, hotel staff and fellow asylum seekers at the Park Inn hotel in Glasgow after a serious breakdown in his mental health. A Sudanese refugee, Abadlla Adam was one of hundreds of asylum seekers moved into hotels by the Home Office at the start of the Covid pandemic, encountering cramped and poor conditions, while having no money and being supplied with poor quality meals. A Home Office report into his case, leaked to BBC Scotland, has revealed he made 72 calls to the department, its contractor Mears – which was in charge of the accommodation – and Migrant Help. The evaluation said his repeated calls about his health and his accommodation should have rung alarm bells but there was “no joined-up view” regarding how to assess the implications of his increasingly frequent calls. While the rationale for using hotels during lockdown appeared sound, the review said too little had been done to appreciate the “significant impact” that approach had on asylum seekers’ mental health, given their likely previous trauma. It found the number of calls “individually and cumulatively (when considering the content of the contact) are not indicative of any elevated risk. However, the number of times he was in contact with the Home Office, Mears and Migrant Help – 72 times – about his accommodation and his health should have acted as a warning. “He also complained to staff in the hotel and was in touch with the Home Office about a voluntary assisted return. Each of those inquiries was dealt with appropriately and in keeping with the relevant operating procedures. There was no joined-up view that allowed a comprehensive view of escalation in the nature and frequency of BA’s contact.” The Home Office said the use of hotels to house asylum seekers had been “unacceptable” and said it had been working hard to find suitable alternatives; that required local councils to provide the right housing, it added. It said lessons had been learned. “Since this horrific incident we have undertaken a number of significant changes to keep asylum seekers safe, including how we, our contractors and charities spot vulnerable individuals and provide them with wraparound support and appropriate accommodation,” it said.",News/UK news,Sudanese refugee made 72 calls seeking help before Glasgow hotel stabbings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/12/sudanese-refugee-made-72-calls-seeking-help-before-glasgow-hotel-stabbings
4/12/2022,"What easy desserts can I make for Easter that don’t contain chocolate?Laura, Oxford It’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking Easter desserts are all about chocolate. So you’re right, Laura, to look for something lighter and brighter (citrus! Rhubarb! Meringue!) – after all, it is spring. For baker Flora Shedden, owner of Aran in Highland Perthshire, the simplest solution is affogato. “Really good vanilla, ginger or even coffee ice-cream, espresso [to pour over] and crushed amaretti on top.” She often chills out with semifreddo, too, combining two parts whipped cream with one part condensed milk, meringue and a few shots of espresso. She freezes it in a loaf tin, then serves it in slices. “The condensed milk and meringue stop it from crystallising, so you’ll have a nice ice-cream texture.” And it welcomes adaptations: “It’s tasty with stem ginger syrup and chopped stem ginger, or fold in some fruit – raspberries with vanilla [instead of the coffee] would be nice.” Also scoring highly in the easy stakes is lemon posset, the chilled British classic for which double cream and sugar are heated before adding lemon zest and juice. “It’s super-quick to make and feels quite springy,” says Shedden, who crowns hers with a couple of crumbled ginger nut biscuits: “Happy days.” You can’t go far wrong with a showstopper pavlova, either. “It feels Eastery because it’s eggs,” says pastry chef Anna Higham, whose debut cookbook, The Last Bite, is out next month. “It’s nice that it collapses a bit, so it doesn’t have to look too perfect.” You could, she adds, mix chopped preserved lemon into the thick, glossy meringue before baking until crisp on the outside and mallowy within: “It gives sharpness to balance that crazy sweetness.” Higham tops her pav with lemon curd, whipped cream and “whatever beautiful citrus you can find”. Rhubarb would also work a treat here, Shedden adds. “I like it a little sweeter: a quarter sugar to one part rhubarb, plus a quarter water.” Add stem ginger, if you fancy, then bake until soft and syrupy. Eat with broken-up meringue and cream whipped with yoghurt, so “it’s not too heavy or sweet”. Galettes are easier than, well, pie. Shedden rolls sweet shortcrust pastry into a disc, spoons over some frangipane, then tops with rhubarb, early berries or blood orange. Fold over the pastry edges and bake; a scoop of ice-cream on the side is optional, but encouraged. Trifle is always a good idea, too, and, Higham notes, “easy to take to a big family celebration”. To make things even more festive, swap the sponge base for hot cross buns: “Toast, soak in loads of booze, then make an earl grey jelly and a custard with sultanas mixed through, and top the lot with whipped cream.” Or skip pudding entirely and go straight for the hot cross buns. Few are more proficient in the subject than Helen Evans of Flor in London, which knocked out 7,000 last year. Her secret? Copious fruit and spices (“toast them whole, then grind”), including a little black pepper and cumin. And don’t forget to give those buns a liberal syruping for a taste of the sweet life.

4/12/2022,"A government scheme in Spain that has prisoners make their jailers’ clothes has come apart at the seams after officers complained their uniforms were ill-fitting, uncomfortable, badly made and sometimes covered in stains. The prison workers’ union, part of the general workers’ union, complained that pockets were sewn at different heights and trousers had legs of unequal lengths. “They don’t meet even minimum standards of quality in either material or manufacture,” said Joaquín Leyva, the union’s spokesperson. “The colours run, they are badly sewn and the sizes aren’t correct.” While it is hardly surprising if prisoners show little concern for their jailers’ comfort, Leyva says the problem is the result of incompetence rather than malice. “There’s no evidence that it’s deliberate on the part of the prisoners,” he said. “The problem is there is no quality control. The prisoners have no training and they are paid per item so, obviously, their concern is for quantity, not quality.” Quality control is carried out by the prisoners, Leyva said, adding that they are not under pressure to produce good work as they are not about to lose their jobs. The contract for prisoners to make the uniforms for the country’s 25,000 prison staff was renewed last week. The union is demanding that it be rescinded, saying the prison workshops “are incapable of making uniforms of sufficient quality”. Leyva said the union wanted the work to be done by an external company with proper standards of quality control. According to the union: “The prison community feels discriminated against compared with other groups such as the national police and the civil guard, who have better quality uniforms made by recognised external companies.” The prison officers’ uniforms are made by a state-run company with a view to giving prisoners work experience and a better prospect of re-entering society on their release. The prison workshops organisation says its aim is for “our workshops produce goods of the highest quality”. Despite the union’s complaints, there seems little chance that the production of the uniforms will be outsourced in the near future, as in recent years the government has invested heavily in machinery and training in the eight textile workshops spread across the country’s prisons.",News/World news,Crime of fashion: Spanish jailers object to quality of prisoner‑made uniforms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/spain-prison-made-uniforms-jail-ugt
4/12/2022,"The World Bank has approved financial support to Ukraine worth $1bn (£770m) to help keep critical services running as the country fights a fresh assault by Russia in Vladimir Putin’s ongoing war. The bank said the funds would be used to support the continuation of key government services, including wages for hospital workers, pensions for elderly people, and social programmes for vulnerable people. Bringing total World Bank support to Ukraine and neighbouring countries to about $2bn, it said the latest round of funding was made possible after securing approval on Monday from its International Development Association arm. Announcing the funds in a speech in Poland on Tuesday, David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, said the organisation was providing immediate working capital for companies providing critical supplies to Ukraine. “We are working to help Ukrainian refugees as they plan their return home, help host communities as they absorb Ukrainians, and help the many millions of internally displaced persons in Ukraine who have lost their homes and livelihoods,” he said. Founded in 1944 to help Europe rebuild after the second world war, the Washington-based institution includes Russia and Ukraine as members. Malpass, who met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Munich before the outbreak of the war, said the bank stood “ready to help Ukraine with reconstruction when the time comes”. The head of the global development body said it was analysing the impacts of the ongoing war, including the rise in food and energy prices expected to have a severe impact for low-income countries around the world. “[We are] preparing a surge crisis response that will provide focused support for developing countries,” he said. The World Trade Organization has downgraded its global trade growth forecasts for the year, saying the prospects for the global economy had darkened since the war started on 24 February.

Kremlin economy and finance ministers are working on new forecasts, the RIA state news agency reported. “The official forecast would be for more than around a 10% contraction,” said Kudrin, who served as Putin’s finance minister from 2000 to 2011, according to the report.",News/World news,World Bank approves extra £770m for key Ukraine services ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/world-bank-approves-770m-ukraine-services-funds-russia
4/12/2022,"Civilians have fled eastern Ukraine in advance of a widely forecast attack and Russian forces closed in on the ruins of the southern city of Mariupol, as Vladimir Putin insisted Moscow’s invasion would achieve what he called its “noble” aims. Ukrainian forces were preparing on Tuesday for a new Russian offensive in the east of the country, with the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Gaidai, urging residents to evacuate as soon as possible using agreed humanitarian corridors. “It’s far more scary to remain and to burn in your sleep from a Russian shell,” Gaidai said on social media. “Evacuate: with every day the situation is getting worse. Take your essential items and head to the pickup point.” Russian troops also continued to pound the Azovstal industrial district of Mariupol where Ukrainian marines were making a last stand in the defence of the strategic port, which has been largely reduced to rubble after six weeks of heavy bombardment. Russia is believed to be trying to seize Mariupol to connect occupied Crimea with theself-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in the eastern Donbas region, but Kyiv insisted its defence of the city was continuing. “The connection with the units of the defence forces that heroically hold the city is stable and maintained,” Ukraine’s military command said, adding that Russian forces were targeting the town of Popasna, two hours’ drive west of Luhansk, and were also preparing an offensive in the direction of Kurakhove, near Donetsk. The deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar said Kyiv was checking unconfirmed information that Russia may have used chemical weapons in the siege of Mariupol, whose mayor has said more than 10,000 civilians have died. “There is a theory that these could be phosphorus munitions; official information will come later,” Malyar said. Russia’s defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment but Moscow-backed separatist forces denied using chemical weapons. Mariupol city council said the area where the poisonous substance had allegedly been used could not be examined because of enemy fire, adding that Ukrainian soldiers who had come into contact with it were being observed for possible symptoms. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said overnight that Russia could resort to chemical weapons and both the US and the UK said they were trying to verify the reports. Zelenskiy on Tuesday also urged the EU to impose sanctions on all Russian banks and Russian oil, and to set firm deadlines for ending imports of Russian gas. “We cannot wait,” he told the Lithuanian parliament. “We need powerful decisions. Only then will the Russian government understand they need to seek peace, that the war is turning into a catastrophe for them.” While Russian troops have withdrawn from around Ukraine’s capital in the face of stiff resistance and apparent logistical problems, western officials and analysts say the invasion force is gearing up for a major offensive in the east. “Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there,” Britain’s defence ministry said. “Russian attacks remain focused near Donetsk and Luhansk with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push toward Kramatorsk.” Visiting the far east of Russia on Tuesday, Putin said the country’s military would “undoubtedly achieve” its goals in Ukraine, saying its objectives were “noble” and the operation was aimed at ensuring Russia’s security. The Russian president said Moscow had no choice but to launch its attack on 24 February. “Its goals are absolutely clear and noble,” Putin said, adding that the main aim was to save people in Russian-controlled Donbas. “On the one hand, we are helping and saving people, and on the other, we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself,” Putin said. “It’s clear that we didn’t have a choice. It was the right decision.” Touring the Vostochny cosmodrome 3,450 miles (5,550km) from Moscow with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, Putin added that attempts to isolate Russia would fail, citing the success of the Soviet space programme during the cold war. “We don’t intend to be isolated,” Putin said. “It is impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world – especially such a vast country as Russia.” Belarus has said it has been unfairly labelled “an accomplice of the aggressor” in Ukraine. Russia’s invasion has so far driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, including more than 4 million who have fled abroad. Russian forces have been accused of multiple atrocities including hundreds of civilian killings. Unprecedented sanctions imposed by the west in response are likely to cause Russia’s economy to contract by more than 10% in 2022, the biggest fall in GDP since the years after following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, a former finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said on Tuesday.",News/World news,Civilians flee eastern Ukraine ahead of new Russian offensive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/civilian-flee-eastern-ukraine-ahead-new-russian-offensive

The financier and environmentalist, who sits on Defra’s board, has apologised after criticising Labour’s strong stance against the Just Stop Oil protests, during which activists have blockaded fuel distribution terminals. He has said he has no plans to resign. Goldsmith, the brother of the minister and peer Zac, tweeted: “Not a good look from Labour. The protesters are right to be doing whatever it takes to wake people up. The fossil fuel industry is grubby and dangerous. We need to unhook ourselves from our dependence ASAP.

While the government continues to refuse to act, Labour has called for immediate injunctions to put a stop to this disruption.” Another Conservative MP called for Goldsmith to step down from his positions at Defra and CEN. Chris Loder, the MP for West Dorset and a member of CEN, said: “Ben Goldsmith is inappropriately interfering in political matters when he is a Defra director, hanging on to his brother’s coattails. He should either resign and stand for election or be sacked.” He threatened to step down himself from CEN, which Goldsmith founded, if the financier was still a member by the end of the day. The Conservative group includes 133 MPs, half of all Tory backbenchers. Others who have criticised Goldsmith’s tweet include Fay Jones, the MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, and the former cabinet minister Damian Green, both on a Conservative WhatsApp group. In an apology message to CEN MPs, Goldsmith said: “This morning I tweeted in a personal capacity my sympathies for the Extinction Rebellion protests. Support of ER is neither a CEN nor a Defra position. I have therefore retracted these tweets. “I recognise the disruption these protests are causing to people’s lives and livelihoods. I’ve always previously stood publicly opposed to the controversial and often bonkers methods employed by ER. That being said, I know I’m not alone in feeling a rising sense of panic as the reported science grows ever grimmer. Awareness and action are not commensurate with the scale of the issue, even if we in the UK are now leading the way globally.” A government source said: “Ben expressed a personal view, not that of the government. People have the right to protest, and the issue of climate change is very important. That’s why we’re taking such ambitious action to tackle it. But these XR protests are not peaceful protests, they are disrupting people’s lives and it is wholly unacceptable. That’s why the government is taking robust action to stop them.”",News/Politics,Tory MPs criticise Ben Goldsmith over praise for Extinction Rebellion ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/tory-mps-criticise-ben-goldsmith-extinction-rebellion-just-stop-oil
4/12/2022,"Prices in the US climbed at their highest rates since 1981, rising 8.5% over the year to the end of March as the war in Ukraine drove up energy costs for Americans, the labor department announced on Tuesday. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) – which measures the prices of a basket of goods and services – comes after the index rose by 7.9% in the year through February, the fastest pace of annual inflation in 40 years. Driven up by continuing supply chain issues, soaring demand and rising energy prices, inflation is now at levels unseen in the US since Ronald Reagan took the White House from Jimmy Carter. The price increases are broad – with the cost of rent, gas and food causing particular hardship for lower income Americans and are a major blow to the Biden administration, already facing tough odds of retaining control of Congress in November’s midterm elections. Soaring gas prices were the main driver of the rise. The gasoline index rose 18.3% in March and accounted for over half of the all items monthly increase. Gas prices have begun to fall, in a sign that some economists have argued may suggest inflation has reached its peak. The White House warned it was expecting a bad set of figures ahead of the report. On Monday White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters that the labor department’s previous report had not included the majority of the jump in oil and gas costs caused by the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. “We expect March CPI headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin’s price hike,” Psaki said. There are two versions of the CPI, one that includes all the prices consumers face and another – core CPI – which excludes food and energy prices which tend to be more volatile. Core prices climbed 6.5% in the year through March, up from 6.4% in the year through February. Psaki said the administration expected a wide disparity between the two measures because of the soaring price of gas. Nationally the average price of a gallon of gas is now $4.11 compared to $2.86 a year ago, according to AAA. “At times, gas prices were more than one dollar above pre-invasion levels, so that roughly 25% increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow’s inflation reading,” Psaki said.",News/Business,"US inflation climbed to 8.5% in March, highest rate since 1981",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/us-inflation-rate-march-2022
4/12/2022,"At first glance, the UK jobs market is in rude good health. The unemployment rate is back to where it was before the Covid pandemic arrived two years ago and job vacancies are at a record high. But just as X-rays can pick up health problems not detectable to the naked eye, so a closer inspection of the labour market shows up some hidden damage. The Covid crisis has not led to the sharp increase in joblessness that was feared but it has still left scars. The number of employees is more than half a million lower than it was in early 2020, primarily due to people over 50 no longer working. According to the Learning and Work Institute thinktank there would be 1.25 million more people in the labour market had pre-pandemic trends continued. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says there is no one reason for the rise in inactivity. Some have decided to stop working due to ill-health, officials believe, while the events of the past two years have convinced others that the time is right to call it a day. Whatever the reason, demand for workers currently exceeds supply, which is why the number of vacancies is so high. Unsurprisingly, employers are responding to the dearth of workers in a variety of ways. They are offering part-time staff longer hours, they are offering sign-on bonuses to new recruits, and they being forced to raise pay rates. The ONS thinks it is possible some of the inactive older workers may be tempted back into the labour market as the cost of living crisis bites harder over the coming months. For public sector workers, falling real pay is already an issue. While bonus payments mean the earnings of people in the finance and business sector have risen by an average of 9.8% over the year to February – well above the 6.2% rise in prices over the same period – public sector pay rose by just 1.9%. Inflation is expected to rise above 8% in April, intensifying the squeeze on public sector workers. Unions representing teachers, nurses, civil servants and local government workers are not going to be especially receptive to calls for wage restraint from Rishi Sunak, especially in light of the chancellor’s recent political and personal difficulties. In the next few months there will be either an exodus of public sector workers to fill the job vacancies in the private sector or industrial action for higher pay. Probably both.",News/Business,Closer inspection of UK jobs market reveals economic scars of Covid | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/uk-jobs-market-pandemic-covid-unemployment-public-sector-workers
4/12/2022,"The online fashion retailer Asos expects to take a £14m hit to its profits and a 2% reduction in growth, following its decision to stop trading in Russia in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The forecast came as the company swung to a £15.8m pre-tax loss in the six months to the end of the February, compared with a £106.4m profit a year earlier, when it was among the internet retailers benefiting from the lockdown e-commerce boom as shoppers stocked up on leisurewear while stuck at home. Sales in the UK grew by 8% to £895.5m over the period, and by 11% in the US. However, Asos said supply chain disruption had led to reduced availability of some products and had prevented it from selling some of its newest lines. The online retailer’s share price was up more than 5% at lunchtime on Tuesday following its half-year results announcement, at about £16.20. A year ago its shares were trading at more than £50. Asos said sales had been boosted by the addition of Topshop brands to its website, particularly in the UK, US and Germany. The retailer acquired Topshop, as well as the brands Topman, Miss Selfridge and the activewear range HIIT, in early 2021, following the collapse of Sir Philip Green’s retail empire during the first year of the pandemic. However, it issued a note of caution in its outlook for the rest of the year, as shoppers are expected to cut back on spending amid rising inflation and the cost of living crisis. Asos said it had not yet seen an impact on consumers’ behaviour or their spending, but predicted this might change in the coming months as shoppers face higher energy bills and tax increases. Asos, which has not had a full-time chief executive since Nick Beighton quit last October, said it had bought more spring and summer clothing in advance, to try to offset longer shipping times, which had resulted in some products arriving a month later than expected. Mat Dunn, Asos’s chief operating officer and finance chief, who is leading the company while it searches for a new boss, said the company had reported increased costs throughout its supply chain. “We have seen it in warehouse wages and the other area we have seen it reflected is in freight costs. They represent the vast majority of our inflationary pressures. We have chosen to absorb a significant amount of that in the short term,” Dunn said. “We believe that ultimately some of those freight costs will unwind and so we have chosen to absorb them rather than pass them on to consumers.” However, he said the company had increased the price of some products by “low to mid-single digits” at the start of 2022. Asos’s results highlighted how the explosion in online shopping during lockdowns has come “crashing back to reality”, according to Matt Britzman, equity analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown. “The goldilocks conditions seen last year are well and truly over. That’s a pretty sombre backdrop and means the outlook from here is a tricky one to be confident about,” he said. Despite Asos’s swing to the red following the easing of Covid restrictions and reopening of shops, Dunn said he believed retail was going through “a period of realignment”, but that online shopping continued to account for a higher proportion of consumer spending than before the pandemic.",News/Business,Asos expects £14m hit from halting trade in Russia after invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/asos-expects-14m-hit-from-halting-trade-in-russia-after-invasion-of-ukraine
4/12/2022,"Stephen Pagliuca, the co-owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team, has confirmed his interest in buying Chelsea, insisting his takeover would ensure the club continued competing for major honours, would never again try to join a European Super League and would remain at Stamford Bridge. Pagliuca’s bid for Chelsea was included on a shortlist of possible takeover options for the club by Raine Group, the US bank handling the sale, last month but little has been heard from the American, who is co-chairman of Bain Capital, a private investment firm. He has now decided to make his intentions clear ahead of submitting a formal bid for Chelsea prior to Thursday’s deadline. In a statement, the 67-year-old said: “This process has been a disconcerting time for the club and fans. Throughout my life and career, my ethos has always been to operate quietly, with integrity, and let my actions and results speak loudly. However, it is imperative to clarify and assure supporters about our bid group and its commitments, to emphasise how seriously we take our potential responsibility to Chelsea. “Our first focus and goal is to make strategic investments to continue competing for championships and trophies. We will support our players and managers to make sure that Chelsea are habitual winners and title contenders, whether in the Premier League, Champions League or the Women’s Super League [the only Super League we intend competing in, for the record]. In addition, we will continue to invest in the youth academy to develop the stars of the future and we would not be in this process if we did not have an exciting and inclusive vision for Chelsea. “Our second focus will be to continue to cherish and preserve the legacy and traditions of the club. In over 20 years of ownership of the Boston Celtics, we have not once considered changing the name, colours, or logo of the club. This is our guarantee to Chelsea fans. Not only are we committed to remaining at the home of Chelsea, Stamford Bridge, but we are inspired to renovate or redevelop the stadium. Chelsea is a world-class team, in a world-class city, with world-class fans: it deserves a world-class stadium.” Pagliuca’s consortium, which is believed to also include Larry Tanenbaum, chairman of the NBA, is complicated by the fact he and a group of co-investors recently purchased a 55% controlling stake in Italian club Atalanta – under Uefa rules, two clubs directly or indirectly controlled by the same entity cannot be involved in the same competition, so were a Pagliuca-owned Chelsea and Atalanta to both qualify for next season’s Champions League, one would have to drop out. Pagliuca has, however, made clear he will follow all required rules and regulations to ensure his bid for Chelsea can proceed and be successful. “We will submit a substantial and credible bid proposal – one that we expect will meet the respective requirements and regulations of the Premier League, UK Government and Uefa,” he added in his statement. “We pledge to honour our commitment to credibility and good guardianship of Chelsea Football Club from day one.” The other three contenders to buy Chelsea are a consortium led by LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly, one led by British businessman Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastian Coe, and the Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs baseball team and have faced a backlash over their desire to buy Chelsea due to accusations of Islamophobia levelled at Joe Ricketts, the family’s patriarch. The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust have publicly voiced concerns about a Ricketts takeover, which has been followed by a fans’ protest outside Stamford Bridge prior to the recent Premier league defeat to Brentford. In response, the Ricketts family has said it “rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms” and on Tuesday confirmed that if its bid was successful, Lord Karan Bilimoria, a Chelsea fan and founder of Cobra beer, as well as outgoing president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), would have a seat on the board. “I founded Cobra Beer just down the road from Stamford Bridge and have been a season ticket holder for many years,” said Bilimoria in a statement. “So when Tom Ricketts approached me to discuss a leading role in his bid group, there was no way I could refuse. Tom and the wider group have a proven track record of running successful sports teams and a strong vision for both the club and the local community.” Roman Abramovich, Chelsea’s owner since 2003, put the club up for sale on 2 March in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old was then sanctioned by the government on 10 March, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin. Chelsea have been granted a special licence to continue operating, though under strict terms, with Abramovich unable to profit from Chelsea’s sale. He has vowed to write off the club’s £1.5bn debt.",Sport/Football,Boston Celtics co-owner vows to ensure Chelsea remain ‘habitual winners’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/stephen-pagliuca-vows-to-ensure-chelsea-remain-habitual-winners-roman-abramovich-takeover
