5/13/2022,"Laura Ingraham asked with a straight face on Thursday why there was no hoarding under former President Donald Trump, prompting outraged people on Twitter to jog the Fox News host’s memory. (Watch the video below.) Ingraham used the current baby formula shortage to assert her blatant falsehood. A recall by a major formula manufacturer has exacerbated an already stressed supply chain, prompting retailers to limit purchases. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced actions to mitigate the crunch, and outgoing White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration has called on stores to impose restrictions “to prevent the possibility of hoarding.” “We know that is an issue,” Psaki added in the clip Ingraham showed Thursday night. Ingraham then asked with a smug cackle: “Why didn’t we have hoarding during the Trump administration?” Her guests, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and conservative author Horace Cooper, heartily agreed. Let us take you back in time, Laura, to the beginning of the pandemic, 2020. Under Trump. We’ll let Twitter take it from here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

5/13/2022,"An image featuring women’s bare breasts has been banned in the United Kingdom following several complaints alleging the images cause “widespread offense” and are inappropriate for children. In February, Adidas launched a campaign on social media as well as billboards and posters, featuring women’s breasts of all shapes and skin tones — with the nipples blurred out. The campaign, shared in the United States as well, was meant to promote and celebrate the company’s 43 styles of sports bras. “Breasts of all shapes and sizes deserve support and comfort tailored to them,” Adidas shared in a statement, alongside a collage featuring 24 images of women’s breasts. “Which is why our new sports bra range contains 43 styles, so everyone can find the right sports bra for them. In sport, everybody should feel free and inspired by what their bodies can achieve.” However, the pictures weren’t sitting well with a lot of viewers. According to the BBC, the Advertising Standards Agency, the UK’s independent regulator of advertising across all media, received 24 complaints claiming the ads's use of nudity objectified women by sexualizing them and “reducing them to body parts.” There were also concerns about whether or not the images were appropriate to be displayed where children could see them. Twitter had also reportedly received a number of complaints but was quick to clarify that the images were not in breach of its terms of service. “Although we did not consider that the way the women were portrayed was sexually explicit or objectified them,” the ASA said this week, ""we considered that the depiction of naked breasts was likely to be seen as explicit nudity. We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text."" The statement continued: ""The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Adidas UK Ltd to ensure their ads did not cause offense and were targeted responsibly."" We believe women’s breasts in all shapes and sizes deserve support and comfort. Which is why our new sports bra range contains 43 styles, so everyone can find the right fit for them.🔗 Explore the new adidas sports bra collection at https://t.co/fJZUEjvopQ#SupportIsEverything pic.twitter.com/CESqmsXOwI — adidas (@adidas) February 9, 2022 Despite the number of complaints received by the ASA, there was still widespread support from Adidas customers, many of whom applauded the company's stance on body positivity. ""Thanks for keeping us abreast of body positivity, Adidas!"" one user wrote in the comments section of the company's Twitter ad. ""This is the breast ever!"" Playboy magazine wrote from its official account. ""Despite all the negative comments I love this,"" one reader added. ""My boobies have changed so much over the years and it’s lovely to see a brand catering for changes and seeing all boobies are normal and natural and beautiful."" Following news that the UK would be banning the ad, Twitter was ablaze with an array of opinions on the matter: Banning an AD for sports bras, because bare breasts might offend people, wtf is wrong with people 🤨🧐😠 https://t.co/kKC2azv9m2 — Kimberley 🌺 👨‍🚀 (@Kim20Squad4Life) May 12, 2022 ""[The ASA] decided the posters were not suitable for use in untargeted media where they could be seen by children""Going to go out on not much of a limb to say most kids have seen breasts.https://t.co/5WajiUQBA5 — Martin Hewitt (@handlewithcare) May 11, 2022 Why is it that bare female breasts are sexualised but not mens?

5/13/2022,"(Reuters) - A former commander of pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine accused Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on Friday of ""criminal negligence"" over Moscow's stuttering military campaign in Ukraine. ""I directly accuse Sergei Shoigu of, at minimum, criminal negligence,"" Igor Girkin said in a video interview posted on his Telegram channel. ""I have no grounds to accuse him of treason, but I would suspect it."" The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request to comment on Girkin's outburst - one of the strongest public attacks yet on Russia's military leadership from a prominent hawk pushing for a more intensive campaign in Ukraine. Despite repeated Russian setbacks and heavy losses in men and equipment in the course of the 79-day-old invasion, Putin has shown no sign of distancing himself from Shoigu. The minister played a highly visible part in commemorations on Red Square on Monday to mark the 77th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. Girkin, who also goes by the pseudonym ""Strelkov"" from the Russian for ""shooter"", has been charged with murder by Dutch prosecutors over his alleged role in the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. He has become an outspoken critic of how Russia is waging its war in Ukraine over recent weeks, saying that without a new strategy and more manpower, Russia could lose. Ukraine says it has repelled Russian forces from around the eastern city of Kharkiv this week and is mounting a counter-offensive that could signal a shift in the war's momentum. After failing to capture the capital Kyiv in the first phase of what Russia calls its ""special military operation"", Russian forces have refocused on the eastern Donbas region and southern city of Mariupol. A former Kremlin mercenary, Marat Gabidullin, told Reuters this week that Russian troops were ill-prepared for the war in Ukraine.
