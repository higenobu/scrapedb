1/18/2022,"Australia’s consumer sentiment dived this month as worries about the explosion in Omicron Covid cases sent confidence to its lowest January level since 1992, according to the latest ANZ-Roy Morgan survey. Consumer confidence fell 7.6% last week, sinking to its lowest rate since October 2020. Omicron case numbers surged across Australia, straining testing facilities and disrupting everything from supply chains to hairdressing salons.  All states fell below the neutral confidence level of 100, and were below the depths of the Delta Covid variant wave. All subindices were also in retreat, including current financial conditions dropping 11.3%. The number of respondents saying now was “the time to buy a major household item” also falling by a similar 11.4%. While the reading for “future financial conditions” was down a relatively modest 4.3%, the proportion of those expecting to be worse off in a year’s time rose to 19%, the most since September 2020. Head of Australian economics at ANZ, David Plank, said “people are spooked by Omicron – obviously, case numbers, deaths unfortunately – and the difficulty of getting tested. All of that has made people apprehensive and nervous.” The low confidence reading, at 97.9, was also notable because it came in January, a time of the year typically associated with upbeat sentiment. Back in January 1992, the last time it was this low in the first month of the year, unemployment was at about 10% and rising towards 11%, Plank said. “What really matters is the labour market conditions were very, very different [from now],” he said. Australia’s November jobless rate was 4.6%, with the ABS scheduled to provide December figures this Thursday. Plank said it remains unclear how long the effects of Omicron will sap consumers’ urge to spend. A separate ANZ report out on Thursday showed there is no sign yet of a reversal in the “Omicron malaise in spending” with a decline of 27% in the first half of January compared with the first half of December. Previous years had seen a decline in the range of 17 to 21% for this period, with dining dropping 26% as people avoided public places. “Weakening consumer confidence through the first half of January is another sign that spending could stay weak for a while longer”, the report said. Offering some solace to businesses – and politicians facing elections soon in New South Wales, South Australia and federally – is that 2021 ended with a significant head of economic steam. “The underlying momentum in the economy at the end of last year, and the stimulus [from governments] mean that I wouldn’t be particularly worried about where the economy will end up if this fear about Omicron and the pandemic starts to ease,” Plank said. “The unknown is, when does it start to ease?” The major banks are beginning to revise their forecasts for GDP growth as they assess Omicron’s disruptive effects. The CBA has been the first to move, disclosing on Tuesday it had chopped its forecast for first-quarter growth to 1% from 2.3%, compared with the December quarter.

Damage, though, is expected to be temporary as consumers and businesses “snap back” when the Omicron wave recedes. CBA’s head of Australian economics, Gareth Aird, said the bank has for now left alone its forecasts for the second half of 2022. “For the calendar year as a whole – that is, 2022 v 2021 – [the revision] lowers GDP growth from 5.1% to 4.8% – not a lot in the scheme of things given how big the margin of error is around forecasting at the moment,” Aird said. “Some of the loss of production and spend will be permanent – but it’s not a huge amount.” The fickleness of planning during a pandemic was also underscored in the ABS’s release of international passenger arrivals and departure details for November. Overseas arrivals reached 197,000 in November, while 229,000 people departed for international destinations, the most since Covid restrictions landed in March 2020, according to the ABS. “While the number of border crossings have increased since travel restrictions were eased in November, there are still far fewer crossings than before the Covid-19 pandemic,” ABS director of migration statistics, Jenny Dobak, said. “[I]n December 2019 there were 1.9 million overseas arrivals and 2.2 million overseas departures, 10 times larger than December 2021 volumes.” Qantas last week signalled how much Omicron had dimmed their outlook. It slashed domestic capacity for the March quarter to be at about 70% of pre-Covid levels, down from the 102% it had planned. International capacity was also reduced to about 20% of pre-Covid levels from the 30% level that had been planned, as nations such as Japan, Thailand and Indonesia increased travel restrictions.",News/Business,‘People are spooked’: Australia’s January consumer confidence sinks to three-decade low over Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/people-are-spooked-australias-january-consumer-confidence-sinks-to-three-decade-low-over-omicron
1/18/2022,"Australia has recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 74 deaths across the country. New South Wales reported a record 36 deaths along with 29,830 new cases; Victoria reported 22 deaths and 20,180 new cases, while Queensland reported 16 deaths and 15,962 cases.  NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, warned on Monday that a higher death toll over the coming days was likely. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, lamented the new record, saying it was a “very difficult day”. “Often over the last two years, we can get focused on reporting the numbers but we should not forget, behind every one of those numbers is a loved one who passed away, or somebody who is in hospital ICU and going through a very difficult time,” he told reporters. ICU admissions in NSW increased slightly to 209, while the number of hospitalisations rose to 2,850. Chant said of the deaths, 22 were men and 14 were women; 33 were vaccinated and three were not. Those who were vaccinated “generally” had not received the third booster shot. She urged people to get their booster shot, saying authorities’ efforts to slow the spread of the virus were to allow people to get their third jab. “I really want the community to have a sense of urgency in going and getting boosted,” she said. “Having said that, we’re still trying to slow the transmission in the community because we want to give time for people to get those boosters.” Perrottet reiterated that he believed his government’s resistance to calls for further restrictions was the right path forward, citing his hopes for a strong economic rebound. “We believe the settings we have in place are appropriate,” he said. “While the health system is under pressure, we are currently tracking better than the best case scenario. That is encouraging, reassuring and pleasing.” Perrottet announced the state can expect another 1.2m rapid antigen tests to arrive overnight, and said another 15m were expected to arrive within the week. Queensland reported its deadliest day in the pandemic. Three of the deaths were people in their 70s, eight in their 80s, four in their 90s and one person who was over 100 years old. Ten people were fully vaccinated, two had had only one dose and four were unvaccinated. None of them had received a booster shot. The state’s chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said the virus was now “hunting the unboosted”. “The virus does seem to be finding older people who have not received that third dose,” he said. The state also saw a jump in hospital admissions, with 819 people currently being treated for the virus, compared to 702 cases on Monday. 50 people are in ICU, with 18 on ventilators. But Gerrard warned that the jump in admissions did not reflect the peak of the outbreak in the state yet. “The numbers are going up, there’s no question about that,” he said. “That is what we’ve been predicting, we’re heading towards our peak, that is still projected to be towards the end of this month.” Queensland’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, announced further restrictions to hospital visits, in the hopes of reducing transmission at health facilities. “This will limit the number of visitors at any one time to two people in wards, and one person in addition to the patient themselves who can attend in an emergency department,” she said. In Victoria, a statewide “code brown” was issued for health services, which streamlines the state’s emergency management response to allow redeployment of staff to critical areas. Acting minister for health, James Merlino, told reporters it was the first time authorities saw the need to introduce a code brown across the state, which will affect all public metropolitan and major regional hospitals from midday on Wednesday. “We’ve been saying for some time that our hospital system is under extreme pressure and the risks we’re seeing now in hospitalisations are testament to that. We’ve reached a point in our health system where it’s juggling severe workforce shortages.” “We’ve got more than 4,000 healthcare workers unavailable right now. We will see the peak in hospitalisations and ICU [numbers] over the next two to four weeks.” The state currently has 1,152 people in hospital with the virus, a slight drop on Monday’s figures. 127 people are in intensive care, with 43 of them requiring ventilation. The six regional hospitals the code brown will apply to are Barwon Health, Grampians Health, Bendigo Health, Goulburn Valley Health, Albury Wodonga Health and La Trobe Regional hospital. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This coordinated approach will help ease the pressure on individual hospitals by better sharing the load across our system,” Merlino said. Tasmania lifted restrictions on interstate travel for the vaccinated, as the state recorded 1,310 new cases. From midnight Tuesday, fully vaccinated arrivals will no longer need to register their travel or take a test prior to travelling. However, those rules do not apply to the unvaccinated unless they have a valid medical exemption.",News/Australia news,Australia records highest daily Covid death toll since beginning of pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/australia-records-highest-daily-covid-death-toll-since-beginning-of-pandemic
1/18/2022,"Today is the deadliest day in Australia’s Covid pandemic. So far this year, about 30 Australians a day are dying with Covid. “[These are] someone’s parents, grandparents, community leaders, people who contribute to our society,” the Burnet Institute director and chief executive officer, Prof Brendan Crabb, says.  And just because someone has “underlying conditions” doesn’t mean it’s less tragic. “Everyone is special,” he says. Australia recorded 74 deaths in the past 24 hours. In Queensland, 16 people died, New South Wales recorded 36 deaths and Victoria had 22 deaths. In the first 18 days of the year, more than 530 people have died – about a fifth of the 2,668 who have died throughout the entire pandemic. That’s despite the now dominant Omicron strain being less severe, despite Australia’s relatively low death rate, and despite claims the virus is peaking. While the death rate is low compared to other countries, there will be a rise in both deaths and hospitalisations, the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned on Monday. “(With) so many cases around, we are going to see a rise, and we’ve been very clear and distinct about that. I’ve spoken about that on many occasions. We will see, and have seen, a rise in deaths,” he said. “We will see, and have seen, a rise in hospitalisations and intensive care.” The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, are among those who believe Covid case numbers are peaking. But hospitalisation and death rates lag two to three weeks behind case numbers, so Australia can expect more deaths in the future. Experts say we don’t know enough about who is dying. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The University of South Australia professor of biostatistics and epidemiology, Adrian Esterman, says not only is Australia lacking a national data collection centre for Covid, we don’t even have nationally consistent definitions, which is “simply crazy”. “It’s a total mish-mash and something should have been done about it,” he says, adding that a national data collection centre is needed. “We do not have national data collection for Covid-19, full stop,” he says. “We don’t even have an agreed definition of things for Covid-19, which is simply crazy. This is why we need a (national centre) in Australia. “What is a case? Is it a PCR test only or a RAT, or both? Or someone who’s a probable case or a definite case?” Esterman points out that the states and territories even use different timeframes to capture daily cases, with 24-hour periods starting and then finishing at different times. “They can’t even agree on a date,” he says. The federal health department publishes some age and sex information on deaths. States and territories publish some local government area data. Most deaths are in people aged 70 years and over, although there have been deaths in every age bracket. In most categories, more men are dying. But in the 90-plus bracket that switches to women. The median age of death is 82 years.

Meanwhile, people are still dying from Delta even as many more cases are Omicron. The states and territories in some instances keep track of those who are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated when they died, but there is no nationally consistent data. It is also not clear when or if a booster will be needed to be declared “fully vaccinated”. Esterman says another difficulty with death data comes down to the doctor signing the death certificate. “They need to know the cause of death, and often it’s not obvious,” he says. “For example, if someone dies with a severe lung disease and had Covid-19, was it the Covid or was Covid incidental? Some people die from Covid, some die with it.” It is well known that many conditions can increase the risk of being hospitalised or dying. Not being vaccinated creates the greatest risk. A person’s age, whether they smoke, if they suffer from cancer, immunodeficiency, diabetes, severe obesity, heart or liver disease, if they are male, or if they are pregnant all add to risk. People undergoing treatments including many cancer therapies such as chemotherapy or therapies that suppress the immune system also have a greater risk of dying. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are at greater risk, as are people with disabilities. Crabb says the use of the phrase “with underlying conditions” in press conferences is “unwise”. He says it may be that health authorities don’t want people to panic about the deaths but that “we have to be very careful about not saying there are two classes of Australians – the ones we care about and the ones we don’t”. “It’s jaw-dropping … I would rather the people who died are recognised and celebrated in the same way other people are when they die in tragedies. It’s disturbing,” he says. “A very large proportion of us do have an underlying condition – heart conditions, diabetes … even if that wasn’t the case, does it matter? “Just because they had diabetes doesn’t make them any less special, and their death any less tragic.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, wants changes to how deaths “with” Covid are recorded. “They went there for some other reason and that’s why they were admitted, and they’ve been tested when they’re there and they’ve been found to have Covid,” he said earlier this month. “So we need to get a standard definition on that because these are the key things we have to track now.” There is also a lack of data about people’s vaccination status and the variant they caught. Esterman says in Australia, we rarely know the vaccination status of those who die, or whether they have Delta or Omicron. State leaders sometimes mention the vaccination status of those who die, but there is not a consistent record. “It would be possible to match up vaccination records with death certificates,” Esterman says. “That should be possible (but) they’re struggling at the moment to even do simple statistics, so how will they do more complicated ones? “I’m not saying it can’t be done, but nobody is doing it.” Esterman says a national centre for data collection is needed. The Public Health Association of Australia and the Australian Medical Association have also called for an Australian centre for disease control and prevention, in a similar vein to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Crabb agrees that we need a way to coordinate infectious disease data nationally “in a way that’s useful to the Australian public in real time and for future planning”. “I think we get the second one (future planning) better than the first (real time),” he says. As well as better tracking, Crabb is concerned that Australia has dropped the ball on testing, tracing, isolating and quarantining. Proper ventilation to prevent airborne transmission is also “grossly underdone”, he says. While Morrison and others insist that case numbers no longer matter and we should focus on hospitalisation rates, Crabb says “cases do matter”. “If we want to get deaths down, we have to get cases down,” he says. “Cases are where deaths come from.” If you have a story you would like to share about someone you love dying from Covid, please get in touch on tory.shepherd@theguardian.com.",News/Australia news,"On Australia’s deadliest day of Covid pandemic, experts say we don’t know enough about who is dying",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/on-australias-deadliest-day-of-covid-pandemic-experts-say-we-dont-know-enough-about-who-is-dying
1/18/2022,"Some of the first images have emerged from Tonga’s volcano and tsunami-hit islands, after a New Zealand defence force surveillance flight returned from the cut-off country, as two deaths from the disaster have been confirmed. Aerial photography of Nomuka, a small island in the southern part of the Haʻapai group, shows land and trees coated with ash and other damage inflicted by the huge undersea volcanic eruption and tsunami that hit the Pacific nation on Saturday.  Satellite imagery analysed by the UN shows similar scenes in Kolomotua, Tongatapu, and Fafaa Village, Kolofo’ou: while some buildings remain standing, others appear to have collapsed, and the entire landscape is coated with grey ash. At Fua’amotu International Airport, the runway appears to have been inundated, and is partly covered by either ash or dirt. Other satellite images show that flooding came in several blocks from the coastline. The eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai undersea volcano, 65km north of Tonga’s capital, is thought to be the largest volcanic event in 30 years. Initial videos and photographs were posted on social media of the tsunami wave sweeping in, but they were followed by silence, after the main communications cable was damaged. Communications from Tonga have been extremely limited in the days since. Tongans around the world may be forced to wait weeks for regular contact to resume, after testing confirmed that the cable connecting the islands to the outside world was cut in at least one place. A spokesperson for Southern Cross Cable, which operates other undersea cable networks across the region, said that testing by Fintel and Tonga Cable on Sunday afternoon “seems to confirm a likely cable break around 37km offshore from Tonga”. On Tuesday, New Zealand’s ministry of foreign affairs and trade said there had been two confirmed deaths, one of which was a British national. There have been no official confirmations of casualties from Tongan authorities, but the family of Angela Glover, a British woman living in Tonga who went missing in the tsunami, reported on Monday that her body had been found. New Zealand foreign affairs minister Nanaia Mahuta said on Tuesday that the ash could cause problems for getting aid into the country via plane. “Images show ashfall on the Nuku’alofa airport runway that must be cleared before a C-130 Hercules flight with humanitarian assistance can land,” she said. The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a briefing on Monday there was significant infrastructural damage around the main island of Tongatapu. “We are particularly concerned about two small low-lying islands – Mango and Fonoi – following New Zealand and Australian surveillance flights confirming substantial property damage,” they said. New Zealand has dispatched two naval ships carrying water and other aid supplies. Mahuta said the New Zealand Government had allocated a further $500,000 in humanitarian assistance, taking its initial funding total to $1 million. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that contact had not yet been established with many coastal regions beyond the capital, Nuku‘alofa. “Nuku‘alofa is covered in thick plumes of volcanic dust but otherwise conditions are calm and stable,” Ardern said. “We have not yet received news from other coastal areas.” With communications severely limited, many Tongan diaspora communities are desperately waiting for news from their families. The Royal New Zealand air force Orion aircraft left Auckland on Monday morning, with plans to fly over the Ha’apai group of islands, and then the main island of Tongatapu, to assess damage and see if runways were clear for subsequent planes to land. The Australian defence force also sent a surveillance plane on Monday, to assess damage to critical infrastructure such as roads, ports and power lines.",News/World news,"Tonga volcano: first pictures after eruption show islands blanketed in ash, as two deaths confirmed",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/tonga-volcano-first-pictures-after-eruption-show-islands-blanketed-in-ash-as-two-deaths-confirmed
