2/15/2022,"STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — A judge has sealed the criminal case file of a wealthy Connecticut woman who secretly recorded three people, including a child, in a manner involving sexual desire — a move called unusual by open government advocates and defense lawyers. Hadley Palmer, 53, who lives in a multimillion-dollar, seaside mansion in Greenwich, pleaded guilty Jan. 19 to three counts of voyeurism and risk of injury to a minor — all felonies committed in 2017. As part of her plea deal, prosecutor Daniel Cummings dropped the two most serious charges — employing a minor in an obscene performance, a Class A felony, and possession of child pornography. The voyeurism charges against her involved recording someone, naked or in their underwear, without their consent or knowledge, with “intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desire of such person (defendant) or any other person.” Many details of the case, however, are sealed away from public view. Judge John Blawie, in Stamford, ruled Thursday that the case should be sealed, over objections by The Associated Press. The judge said the need to protect several victims’ identities outweighed the public’s right of access to criminal proceedings and documents including details of the allegations. The ruling came nearly four months after Blawie initially allowed Palmer’s case file to be sealed from public view. On the same day she was arrested on Oct. 25, Palmer appeared in court and Blawie accepted her application for a special probation program. State law requires case files to be sealed when such an application is made, but the original charges against Palmer made her ineligible for the program because they were so serious. “Having a wholesale sealing of a criminal matter like this is highly unusual and I would argue improper, especially where there are more narrowly tailored means that could exist"" to protect the victims' identities, said Jennifer Nelson, a senior staff attorney with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Palmer declined to comment on her case following a recent court hearing. The daughter of a notable hedge fund founder, Jerrold Fine, she is currently divorcing her venture capitalist husband, Bradley Palmer. She is seen in photos on the internet at fundraising galas and other society events. Her lawyer, Michael Meehan, did not return messages seeking comment. Palmer agreed to serve a prison sentence of 90 days to five years, followed by 20 years of probation. Blawie will decide the exact sentence. The convictions also require registration on the state’s sex offender registry. But the plea agreement notes that a judge may seal the registry entry from public view if the judge determines public registration is not needed for public safety and would be likely to reveal the victims’ identities. On Feb. 4, Palmer began serving 90 days in the state women’s prison, as part of her plea agreement. The Greenwich police investigation also resulted in the arrest of a child psychologist who was charged with failing to report child abuse or neglect to authorities, as required by state law. The psychologist’s case file also is sealed. His lawyer did not return messages seeking comment. Blawie and officials at the state Judicial Branch declined to comment when asked why Blawie allowed Palmer to apply for the accelerated rehabilitation probation program and why documents cannot be redacted like they are in similar cases. Melissa Farley, a court system spokesperson, said it is policy for judges and other judiciary officials to not comment on pending cases. Blawie sealed the case file Thursday at Palmer’s request. Cummings, the prosecutor, also said the case file should be sealed, because it was not possible to redact the arrest warrant and other documents in a way that would fully protect the victims’ identities. Palmer also is asking the judge to close portions of her sentencing hearing to the public, including her own testimony — also called unusual by open courts advocates and lawyers. During the case, the court hearings have been open to the public, including a Feb. 1 hearing on Palmer’s motion to seal the file. The AP objected to a complete sealing of the case file, saying documents could be redacted and pseudonyms used as in other state court cases involving crimes against children to protect the victims while allowing the public to see how serious the allegations are. At that hearing, several lawyers for the victims said they supported sealing the case file. Connecticut’s chief public defender, Christine Perra Rapillo, whose office represents low-income defendants, said sealings of criminal case files are unusual. “I’ve never had a case where I’ve moved to seal the file,” she said. “It’s not a practice that you usually see in criminal court. The presumption in all courts, particularly criminal courts, is that the proceedings are open.” William Fish Jr., a Hartford attorney not involved in the case who specializes in open government and press access issues, said the complete sealing of criminal cases is “almost unheard of.” Add in Palmer’s wealth, Fish said, “And it makes you wonder what’s going on.” Nearly every week in Connecticut’s courts, people charged with serious crimes against children appear before judges and their case files aren’t sealed. Arrest warrants are generally available to the public, although the names of the victims may be redacted or replaced with pseudonyms. Last month in Vernon, for example, a man was charged with sexual assault, voyeurism and other crimes after police said he abused his girlfriend’s teenage daughter and secretly recorded her and others in a bathroom. He denies the charges. His case file remained open. The arrest warrant detailing the allegations remained open to public view, with the names of his girlfriend and her daughter replaced with pseudonyms. Adding to the secrecy in Palmer’s case, before Blawie sealed the file Thursday, Palmer’s name and court case numbers appeared on the criminal case webpages of the state court system’s main website only on the days she was scheduled to be in court, unlike other cases that appear daily on the website in which defendants apply for accelerated rehabilitation. After Blawie’s ruling, her name and case numbers began appearing daily on the site. Judicial Branch officials declined to comment on why that happened. In general terms, applications for accelerated rehabilitation and certain other diversion programs result in the case files being sealed but the defendants’ names and case numbers remaining on the website, officials said. Palmer withdrew her application from the probation program on Jan. 14 and immediately filed a motion the same day to seal the file. Blawie allowed the case file to remain sealed pending the required Feb. 1 hearing and his final ruling.",U.S./Associated Press,Connecticut judge seals Greenwich woman's voyeurism case,https://news.yahoo.com/connecticut-judge-seals-greenwich-womans-192352007.html
2/15/2022,"By Leah Douglas Feb 14 (Reuters) - Corn-based ethanol, which for years has been mixed in huge quantities into gasoline sold at U.S. pumps, is likely a much bigger contributor to global warming than straight gasoline, according to a study published Monday. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, contradicts previous research commissioned by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) showing ethanol and other biofuels to be relatively green. President Joe Biden's administration is reviewing policies on biofuels as part of a broader effort to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050 to fight climate change. “Corn ethanol is not a climate-friendly fuel,” said Dr. Tyler Lark, assistant scientist at University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment and lead author of the study. The research, which was funded in part by the National Wildlife Federation and U.S. Department of Energy, found that ethanol is likely at least 24% more carbon-intensive than gasoline due to emissions resulting from land use changes to grow corn, along with processing and combustion. Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol trade lobby, called the study ""completely fictional and erroneous,"" arguing the authors used ""worst-case assumptions cherry-picked data."" Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law enacted in 2005, the nation's oil refiners are required to mix some 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol into the nation's gasoline annually. The policy was intended to reduce emissions, support farmers, and cut U.S. dependence on energy imports. As a result of the mandate, corn cultivation grew 8.7% and expanded into 6.9 million additional acres of land between 2008 and 2016, the study found. That led to widespread changes in land use, including the tilling of cropland that would otherwise have been retired or enrolled in conservation programs and the planting of existing cropland with more corn, the study found. Tilling fields releases carbon stored in soil, while other farming activities, like applying nitrogen fertilizers, also produce emissions. A 2019 study https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17597269.2018.1546488 from the USDA, which has been broadly cited by the biofuel industry, found that ethanol’s carbon intensity was 39% lower than gasoline, in part because of carbon sequestration associated with planting new cropland. But that research underestimated the emissions impact of land conversion, Lark said. USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the nation's biofuel policy, is considering changes to the program. Under the RFS, Congress set blending requirements through 2022, but not beyond, giving the EPA authority to impose reforms. EPA plans https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-is-stake-us-biofuel-blending-law-2022-beyond-2022-01-11 to propose 2023 requirements in May.

2/15/2022,"HUDSON, Ohio – An Ohio mayor has resigned from his mostly ceremonial office after two high-profile political controversies. Craig Shubert submitted his resignation Monday morning to the clerk of the City Council and issued a statement. The mayor made national headlines last week when he voiced concerns that allowing ice fishing at a park would bring prostitution to the city. Shubert also made news last year when he called for school board members to resign over an optional book in a college-level class at Hudson High School that he called ""child pornography."" Summit County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh's office reviewed the allegations and released a blistering rebuke into the mayor's claim and the scores of threats against school board members that followed. Hudson mayor in hot water: City council caught off guard after mayor says ice fishing shanties may lead to prostitution In his resignation statement, Shubert clarified his remarks on ice fishing. ""My comments at Tuesday’s workshop were made out of concern for our community; what could become of unintended consequences of new legislation, based on my prior television news reporting experience,"" Shubert wrote. ""My attempt to inject a bit of dry humor to make a point about this, in the midst of a cold, snowy February, was grossly misunderstood. “Some in our community saw this as an opportunity to engage in the politics of personal destruction by means of character assassination, blaming me for the negative international press they helped to promote."" Shubert said he's ready to move on to a new stage. “Since the passing of my wife, First Lady Sherri Moyer, I have given considerable thought to the next stage of my life. Retirement is on the near horizon,"" he wrote. ""With the recent changes on city council, where six of seven seats have turned over, City Hall is entering a new era. My role as a change agent is complete."" The leader of the City Council said he and his colleagues appreciated the mayor's service. “City Council appreciates the time and dedication that Mayor Shubert has put in to serving the citizens of Hudson,” said Hudson City Council President Chris Foster. “We respect his decision and wish him the best in the future.” Shubert was elected mayor in November 2019 when he defeated incumbent David Basil. In 2018, he sought the Republican Party nomination for the Ohio House's 37th District race but lost.

2/15/2022,"Russia has moved some long-range artillery and rocket launchers into firing position, threatening Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. Some Russian units have left their assembly areas — the bumper-to-bumper formations seen in satellite photos — and are beginning to move into ""attack positions,"" according to the official. This movement marks a change since Sunday, when some of the units had left the assembly areas but had not yet taken what could be viewed as attack positions. The U.S. believes Russia will attack Ukraine by the end of the week, although it's not yet certain what form it will take, the official said. Once the Russian attack begins, U.S. knowledge of what is happening will dramatically decrease. Americans will have no troops on the ground and no reconnaissance planes over the air, and Russian cyber attacks and electronic warfare will blot out communications. U.S. officials say Russia now has 80% of the forces it will need to launch a full-scale invasion, and the rest are en route. More than 100,000 Russian troops are amassed along Ukraine's borders — to the east, in Russia, and the north, in Belarus.  National security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Sunday morning on ""Face the Nation"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin could give the orders for an invasion ""essentially at any time."" ""We have seen over the course of the past 10 days a dramatic acceleration in the build-up of Russian forces and the disposition of those forces in such a way that they could launch a military action essentially at any time,"" Sullivan said. ""They could do so this coming week, but of course, it still awaits the go-order"" from Putin. Sullivan acknowledged that there is a distinct possibility that Russia may launch a false-flag attack, perhaps in the Donbas region of Ukraine, in order to justify an invasion, and he said that the U.S. is ""watching very carefully."" In that scenario, Russian intelligence services might ""conduct some kind of attack on Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine or on Russian citizens, and then blame it on the Ukrainians,"" Sullivan said Sunday. Sullivan is briefing congressional leaders on the latest developments on Ukraine Monday. On Saturday, President Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. will ""respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs,"" should Russia invade Ukraine. — This is a developing story.

2/15/2022,"Who says cops don’t have a sense of humor? Right after Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles wrapped Sunday night, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office posted one of the first game-related memes of likely many to come. It was of Mary J. Blige, one of the retro fabulous rappers to take the stage at halftime, flopping backward onto a large white stage as she concluded her set with the 2001 classic “No More Drama.” Talk about drama: The 51 year old music icon fell onto her back in a so-called death drop that got social media talking. The Facebook caption, attempting to express the agency’s frustration: “Us after telling our residents and visitors for the 1,000,000th time to lock their cars.” FB commenters, many of whom possibly just witnessed the high-energy spectacle on their TVs or phones, appreciated the way on-topic post: “Well done, mic dropped!” “Social media manager is on point.” “That’s hilarious. Someone is on the ball.” Law enforcement agencies through the state typically advise residents to prevent criminal activity by remembering the so-called 9 p.m. routine. Reportedly started by the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office in 2016, it typically includes such pre-bedtime tips as removing valuables, then locking the vehicle, as well as securing your home and keeping the outside lights on.

2/15/2022,"A viral post calling for Black women to come to Kanye West’s rescue once again raises questions about why we’re always expected to save everyone but ourselves. This past weekend was another a busy one for Kanye West. In his ongoing war against soon-to-be-ex-wife Kim Kardashian-West and her new beau Pete Davidson, he took to Instagram to post a barrage of insults, all reportedly in an effort to expose the media narrative being built against him and “fight” for his family. Though I’ve intentionally made it a point not to follow his antics, when Kanye does something—anything—he trends and tuning in often becomes almost unavoidable. When I saw him trending this time, I assumed it was Kanye being Kanye. I wasn’t wrong. It wasn’t until one of my Sorors dropped into our group chat with an Instagram post positing Kanye wouldn’t know peace until he’s in a relationship with a Black woman that I felt some kind of way. While conversations about Kanye’s wellness and self-acknowledged bipolar diagnosis have long lingered in response to incidents of him publicly acting out, so have questions of who’s around to hold him accountable. As someone who has experienced deep loss, works diligently to maintain my own mental health and has some behaviors and traits that only get better when I put that work in, I know how complicated conversations around Kanye are. Everything isn’t reducible to his mental health nor should it be. At the same time, mismanagement of mental health isn’t good for anyone and can jeopardize everything. That’s why, in response to both the initial post and the resulting social media conversations, I chimed in to say a Black woman isn’t what Kanye needs, it’s therapeutic support to be his best self and a personal commitment to want to be. While many Black women are licensed therapists and counselors, that is not and should not be the default of every Black woman. And, though we make great accountability partners, Black women shouldn’t be expected to hold everyone accountable—especially someone who hasn’t asked for it and makes relationship choices as though he’d rather do without it. But to be honest, while Kanye is the most current context for this sentiment, the idea that sisters are the cure-all for whatever ails you isn’t a new one. Black women have long been expected to save America from total destruction, love Black men into the best versions of themselves, raise accomplished and respectful children, maintain a home without blemish or flaw, and secure a level of social status and respect their husbands and children can be proud of all while drinking eight glasses of water daily, volunteering at the church, being the backbone of their extended families and maintaining desirable bodies and clear skin. Any time she deviates from any of these simple tasks, she has set Black America back 100 years. And the moment she calls out the foolishness, she is the problem. In the context of Kanye, whether it was Black women telling me I’m just not the kind of Black woman who can help a Black man reach his full potential or Black men calling me fat, ugly, undesirable and not a woman brothers want anyway, my social media was filled with people telling me I had no idea what I was talking about. Many even took the time to remind me of Kanye’s wealth, one going so far as to say I was trashing a billionaire when I was probably sitting with a checking account in overdrafts. This type of response isn’t new and doesn’t just happen to me. It’s part of an ugly, violent and persistent trend of denigrating Black women who advocate for themselves and other Black women. These people virtually spit in the faces of women who look like their mothers, grandmothers, sisters, cousins and aunties—women who look like them—and don’t think twice about it. Instead, they painstakingly take the time to single out Black women like me as what’s wrong with our community. Question: How are Black women like me the problem and the solution? How is it that Black women are expected to come to the rescue of those who “need” us but when Black women push back against that trope, we’re told Black men don’t want us anyway? And why are we often told we’re only tolerated because Black men are—as one commenter claimed—“stuck” with us if they want to have Black children? I can’t be what you need and the reason you need it. And it will never be wrong to insist that, as Black women work to be whole and well themselves, they deserve partners who can extend the same in reciprocity. Here are a few things that are true and two things I know for certain: There will be another instance (or countless ones) when the call for Black women to come in and clean up a mess they didn’t create will be made. When that happens, Black women who refuse to pick up that mop and bucket will continue to be targets of vicious attacks across social and digital platforms. It’s well past time we actually care enough to stop both from happening. For some Black men, that will require that they take a moment to actually see us. Not just see themselves in us but see us as we are—human beings maneuvering similar weights and challenges in a world of anti-Blackness. It will require deep and honest reflection about harm done and necessitate that men hold each other accountable when they see another Black man engaging in that kind of harm. It also requires Black women to take residence in the sacred space of saying “no” to notions that deny our humanity and refuse us the right to real self-care. It means honoring that we are more than the world’s clean-up woman. It means remembering and reminding each other: We have always been more.
