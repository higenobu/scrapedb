2/4/2022,"Hannah Arendt, the political philosopher, once wrote that “power always stands in need of numbers”. That insight, made in the context of a study into the nature of violence, is one that commentators often turn to when explaining why Māori appear to fare so much better than Indigenous peoples in other parts of the Anglosphere. Māori make up more than 15% of the New Zealand population – more than five times larger than the Aboriginal Australian or Native American share of their national populations – meaning Māori are in a better position to press for guaranteed representation in parliament and local government, for dedicated television channels and radio stations, for native language schooling, and more. Indigenous peoples in other countries, to paraphrase Arendt, stand in need of numbers. The argument is seductively simple. Social scientists sometimes call it the 3.5% rule. In other words, if enough people engage in active struggle – from workers’ strikes to street protests – the disruption they cause is almost always enough to guarantee political change. In the 1980s socialist organisers were turning out tens of thousands of people on the streets to protest the Springbok tour, nuclear warships, and racism against Māori. It’s impossible to measure whether the 3.5% threshold was met, but it’s obvious enough that the many thousands who took part in demonstrations and advocacy were enough to cancel any further Springbok tours, to prohibit nuclear warships from New Zealand waters, and to strengthen the Treaty of Waitangi’s position in the New Zealand constitution.  And yet this explanation also strikes as terribly grey, reducing history to a mere numbers game. That reductiveness is probably what attracts politicians to the argument. In 2004 the then race relations minister Trevor Mallard, who is now speaker of the House, told media that Māori party co-leader Tariana Turia was encouraging Māori teenagers as young as 13 to get pregnant in order to build the base for “Māori ownership of the country”. The accusation was transparently false, but it did neatly foreshadow the political right’s obsession with birthrates a decade later. White people are having too few babies, and brown people are having too many. In this calculus politics – or rather, power – is a mere numbers game and as soon as Māori birth enough babies to outmuscle or outvote the white majority then the country is theirs. Even the most charitable reader can identify that as racist. But it’s also, as a historical explanation for why Māori enjoy the power that they do, inadequate. History so often relies on contingencies. Not in the empiricist sense that some historians enjoy – AJP Taylor once made the tickling argument that what made WWI possible was railway timetables – but in the sense that certain institutional forms and movement configurations (with numbers added in) guarantee success. In New Zealand the Māori activists of the 70s and 80s were successful not so much because they had countless thousands on their side but because they brought together a necessary coalition of iwi, trade unions, university students, and politicians. In short, enough allies to cause enough disruption. In the retrospectives to the activist groups of the 70s and 80s it’s often ignored that the people we consider movement darlings – Hone Harawira, Annette Sykes, and the many others – weren’t so popular in their day. As the scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith explained at the Ngā Tamatoa 50th reunion “you would not have invited us to dinner. You would have been embarrassed because we would have caused a fight. We would have caused a fight about the Treaty [of Waitangi]. We would have caused a fight about the survival of our people”. That confrontational approach meant many of the more conservative kaumātua (Māori elders) and iwi (tribal) leaders were either uncertain or outright hostile to younger groups like Ngā Tamatoa. Dun Mihaka, a Marxist and one of the best-known activists of the time, memorably condemned his older, conservative opponents for exercising the “traditional tyranny of kaumatuatanga [elders]” by continually “nodding [their] heads in agreement” with Pākehā politicians and wagging their fingers at the younger people demanding better. Of course, that binary – the young v the old – is equally reductive as the numbers argument. Ngā Tamatoa was made up of more than just the broad category of “young people”. The great Ranginui Walker, who was a kaumātua even in the 1970s while in his 40s, was one of the group’s founders and intellectual leaders. Even the older, conservative leaders of institutions like the Māori Council were happy to use the younger activists when it suited contrasting the vocal outsiders with their demands (Ngā Tamatoa et al) to the insiders with their readiness to cut a good deal (the Māori Council). And that brings us closer to why Māori are perhaps in a comparatively more powerful position than other Indigenous peoples. Radical movements and conservative institutions were working not necessarily in concert, but certainly toward the same aim: recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi. In the early to mid-20th century politicians would often praise New Zealand for enjoying “the best race relations in the world”. Nowhere were two races so well “integrated”. Māori, then an even smaller minority than they are today, were leaders in politics – enjoying at least four seats in parliament at all times – workplaces, and sport. In the Pākehā (white) imagination that race relations boast was thus self-evidently true. Had it not always been so? Even in the 19th century political and intellectual leaders were extolling the virtues of Māori and their Pākehā compatriots. In his general history of the young dominion William Pember Reeves wrote of Māori as “the finest race of savages the world has seen”. This was part of a long, sleazy lineage claiming that Māori – and by extension, New Zealand – were somehow exceptional. In 1885 the surveyor Edward Treagar argued that Māori were descendants of Aryans. In a droll observation a century later one of the leading historians of his generation, James Belich, noted that Treagar’s argument was a convenient cover for colonisation allowing the British to argue that their taking of New Zealand was simply a family reunion. Māori had fallen a few branches down, the argument went, but with British tutelage they could claim their rightful place at the top of the racial tree. It’s a claim that collapses upon the slightest interrogation. And so too do all of the arguments that grew from it. Māori did enjoy guaranteed representation in parliament, to take one example, but that representation wasn’t tied to their share of the population. When the Māori Representation Act 1867 came into force the number of Māori seats in parliament was capped at four when, on a population basis, Māori were entitled to more than a dozen. To the activists of the 70s and 80s this injustice and the many others were becoming intolerable. In 1975 more than 60,000 New Zealanders put their name to a petition calling for an end to the alienation of Māori land. This protest, often framed in the press as a mere nuisance, had been bubbling below the surface for at least 20 years. In 1953, the same year Her Majesty paid her first visit to the Waitangi Treaty Grounds, the then National government made sweeping changes to Māori land law allowing, in Aroha Harris’s words, “the compulsory alienation of uneconomic Māori land interests”. This property seizure clause was the root of ongoing resentment into the 60s and 70s with several groups, from conservatives to radicals, organising protests, petitions, and pleas against it. At this point in time Māori were hardly better off than Indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, or the United States. The New Zealand government could seize Māori land under a tissue-thin pretence. Customary practices like adoption were folded into general legislation in the same decade as well, taking the country one step closer to “assimilation” between Māori and Pākehā. But the mid-20th century is where Māori perhaps begin to diverge from their seniors in Australia and Turtle Island. In 1977 the great rangatira (Māori chief) Joe Hawke and the Ōrākei Māori Action Committee (OMAC) led hundreds in an occupation of Takaparawhā. Known to Pākehā as Bastion Point Reserve, the land was victim to compulsory acquisitions over several decades and come the 1970s the government was planning to develop a housing estate for wealthy Aucklanders. This was a typical story. Yet Hawke and OMAC made an atypical response. They went back to the land and rebuilt a pā – a village, essentially – publicly declaring their intention to take back what was their ancestral right. The letters to the editor writers were wild. The then prime minister Robert Muldoon took regular cracks at the occupiers, whipping the letter writers into a frenzy. In ordinary times pressure from the top of government might have been enough to dissuade the occupiers. But OMAC had a genuine movement on its side: first, in a large majority of Māori; second, in the local (if not necessarily national) residents who according to one poll were overwhelmingly opposed to the development; and third, in the form of the trade union movement. When Muldoon sent in the police and the army to evict OMAC hundreds of workers in Wellington walked off the job in a wild cat strike. On the same day the Auckland Trades Council reconfirmed that its construction members would adhere to a “green ban” on the site. That meant the government had no practical means to pursue its development plans. No union members would accept the job and the local residents, who weren’t necessarily pro-Māori, were anti-development. This organising model was taken up across the country in the decades following. In 1988, 10 years after the eviction, the crown made its first honourable retreat, returning the land to its rightful owners in Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei. In a rare act of contrition the crown acknowledged its breach of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. But that is quite a curious formulation. The government was sorry for breaching the “principles” of the treaty. What of its text? As it happens the conservatives of the Māori Council (who were generally of the older generation) had carved the crown’s tracks to retreat. In 1987 their leaders took the government to the court of appeal over its privatisation policy arguing that transferring land from public ownership to the new “state-owned enterprises” was “inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi”. The court agreed and in a landmark decision conferred form and content on those principles. Today the principles – known colloquially as partnership, participation, and protection – bind the crown. In the 90s and 2000s the principles were responsible for helping force the government to negotiate over rights to land, fisheries, broadcasting, and more. In this context, then, what made the victory at Takaparawhā possible was a two-track strategy. The radicals in OMAC demanding nothing less than the return of the land and the conservatives like the Māori Council and the insiders like Labour MP Koro Wetere providing the institutional means for doing so. But 30 years later this arrangement is proving increasingly inadequate. Although it was mostly successful at Ihumātao with Save Our Unique Landscape demanding the return of the South Auckland headland and institutions like the Kīngitanga and Labour MP Nanaia Mahuta working to provide the means for doing so, it comes at an unacceptable cost. Why should Māori activists submit years of their life to a cause that should happen as of right? And so Waitangi Day 2021 is marked by a new series of land battles: at Shelley Bay in Wellington, at Ōpihi Whanaungakore in the Bay of Plenty, and at iwi checkpoints across the country as Māori in the north, east, and west insist on their right to protect their borders against Covid-19. It’s this battle – against the virus and government inertia – that indicates maybe the insider-outsider strategy is at its end. No amount of Māori inside the Ministry of Health, for example, could stop that agency from monopolising vaccine procurement, distribution, and outreach. Even Māori organisations outside the ministry such as the Waipereira Trust, the largest single vaccine provider in Auckland, struggled to force the government to share data in its efforts to reach unvaccinated Māori. In the end the trust CEO John Tamihere had to turn to the courts for a partial victory. Perhaps this reaffirms Arendt’s argument that power always stands in need of numbers. This seems especially true in a majoritarian democracy. But what if, as Waitangi Day seems to remind us, we can source power in social movements? Ihumātao is a reminder that, in Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s words, there is power in causing a fight.

2/4/2022,"As debate rages about the religious discrimination bill, let’s remember a simple fact: under federal law, religious schools can already expel gay and transgender students for their sexuality and gender. As Coalition attack lines have emphasised this week, this power comes from an exemption for religious educational institutions in the Sex Discrimination Act, including a version passed by the Labor government in 2013.  So once upon a time, there was bipartisan support for this. Fast forward to May 2018, when the Ruddock review into religious freedom, launched during the same-sex marriage debate, reported back to the Turnbull government. One of its key recommendations was: if religious schools want to discriminate against staff or students for their sexuality or gender, this must be stated in a public policy. The Turnbull government didn’t release the report right away, then in August Turnbull was succeeded by Scott Morrison, the beneficiary of a conservative push against a moderate Liberal prime minister. Turnbull quit parliament, triggering a byelection in the socially progressive, usually safe Liberal seat of Wentworth. Ten days before the byelection, the recommendations of the Ruddock review leaked. The review panel had thought they’d get a pat on the back for tightening the existing religious exemption but instead the leak triggered a backlash over the fact that schools were able to expel LGBTQ+ students at all. The Liberal candidate, Dave Sharma, rejected their right to do so. Labor offered bipartisan support to fix the law, and within days Morrison committed to amendments to ensure students weren’t discriminated against on the basis of sexuality or gender. The Morrison government lost the byelection, then in November 2018 made a half-hearted effort to implement the promise which failed when Coalition senators insisted that existing religious exemptions “should not be eroded unless adequate protections for religious freedom are afforded in their place”. The government asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to study the problem, giving it a deadline of April 2020 to report back, then asked it to delay until 12 months after the religious discrimination bill had passed parliament. So bipartisan support to protect LGBTQ+ kids had become theoretical support only from the Coalition, with religious freedom first cab off the rank and LGBTQ+ children to follow. The religious discrimination bill went through its own torturous process of drafting and redrafting, during which Liberal moderate MPs asked for the LGBTQ+ commitment to be delivered. Before the bill was introduced the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, wrote to the ALRC asking for “detailed drafting” to protect LGBTQ+ students, but in terms of timing it was still religion first, LGBTQ+ kids second. Morrison introduced the bill on 25 November. On 1 December a group of four Liberal moderate MPs revealed they had a deal with Cash to remove the religious educational exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act, to protect both teachers and students. On the same day, Morrison wrote to Anthony Albanese proposing to protect students through an amendment. But Morrison sought Labor’s support to wave the religious discrimination bill through the lower house, unamended, meaning that the amendment to protect LGBTQ+ students was to follow either in the Senate or after the religious bills passed. Albanese wrote back that although “protection against religious discrimination should be a uniting, and not dividing, moment for the nation” he wanted to wait for committee inquiries to report back on 4 February, because both MPs and senators needed to know the outcome before casting their votes. In mid-December, Cash then told Christian lobby group FamilyVoice protections for LGBTQ+ students would still have to wait for the ALRC review, 12 months after the religious bills – appearing to renege on the deal with Liberal moderates. Criticism of Cash was muted, as we now know because Morrison had made a commitment to the four MPs, who thought the deal might still stand. On Thursday, the firestorm around Citipointe Christian College led the prime minister to recommit to protect LGBTQ+ students, this time confirming the amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act would be contained in the religious package. Did Cash mislead Christian stakeholders? FamilyVoice’s Greg Bondar said the amendment was “inconsistent” with what Cash had said, and Morrison had “betrayed” the principles of the religious bill. After months of saying LGBTQ+ students would have to wait for protection, they finally appeared to have equal priority with the religious discrimination changes. As the Greens senator Janet Rice has noted, a child who started high school in 2018, when the commitment was first made, will graduate in 2023 when the ALRC might report back. Now, perhaps, these kids will see the change made while they’re in year 11. But on Friday, the assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, walked the commitment back, warning that the Sex Discrimination Act “shouldn’t be changed unless we know the final form of the Religious Discrimination Act”. “I understand that the prime minister is looking for ways that those things can be done at the same time,” she said, warning of “unintended consequences” if the Sex Discrimination Act change didn’t “integrate well” with the religious bills. At a doorstop on Friday, Morrison reasserted his intention to legislate protections at the same time as the religious bill. But why the delay at all? And what are the unintended consequences? Stoker said the government wanted to allow schools to still be able to “maintain standards of behaviour within their community”. As the attorney general’s department and the Sydney Anglican church both noted in submissions to the religious discrimination bill inquiries, religious schools have the right to sack teachers for their views on sexuality. The Sydney Anglican church defended an unnamed Christian school against the widely reported claims that teacher Stephanie Lentz had been sacked for being gay, arguing she was sacked “because of [her] belief that a person can be a Christian and be gay” – not for her sexuality itself. This is why the issue grinds on so slowly, for the Coalition and other conservatives: the legislative solution must be crafted so a gay student can’t be expelled or a teacher fired for their sexuality, but a school must be able to punish those who can reconcile their sexuality and religion and express that view. In a sense, it doesn’t matter whether the changes are contained in the same bill, or follow in time one after the other. If LGBTQ+ students and teachers can be gay or have a view about their gender identity without being allowed to express it, the logical priority enforced through law is still: organised religion first, gender and sexuality second.",News/Australia news,The Coalition promised in 2018 to protect LGBTQ+ children in schools.

2/4/2022,"In the midst of an Omicron outbreak and almost two years after New Zealand shut its borders, the government has announced its latest reopening plan. For most New Zealanders, the coming months will be their first direct experience of widespread Covid-19. No one, not even the minister in charge, knows what exactly will come next. “I think we’re all nervous about what the next few months has in store for New Zealand,” Chris Hipkins, the minister responsible for the country’s pandemic response, told the Guardian. “Covid-19, and Omicron in particular, is here now – it is in New Zealand and it will spread. We know that is going to happen. The extent of that, the effectiveness of our public health measures, the effect on our health system and on our most vulnerable populations is still something that’s the subject of models rather than reality.”  The border has been the linchpin of New Zealand’s Covid response, the crucial ingredient of its long virus-free stretches, and the primary reason that it is now facing down endemic infection with a highly vaccinated population. That border coming down is a symbol of how radically New Zealand’s pandemic response has shifted over the last six months: from the relentless pursuit of Covid zero, to a gradual acceptance that Covid had arrived, and would spread throughout the country. For some people, Hipkins thinks the spread of Omicron and reopening of the borders will come with a shock – that the path to rebuild normality, and travel infrastructure to and from the country will be slow. “I think there’s a view that seems to have formed amongst some people that the rest of the world is sort of back to normal,” he says. “Normal is still a way away. And not all of that’s going to be within New Zealand’s control – we’ve still got Covid-19 spreading around the world, there’s still the potential for new variants of Covid 19 … it’s not like you suddenly turn on a switch and you know, all the planes go back into the air and everything’s back to the way it was.” The drawbridge will start easing down later this month: opening first to New Zealanders coming from Australia, then a few weeks later to New Zealanders elsewhere, then Australians, visa holders, and finally everyone else. The reopening is marked by New Zealand’s now-customary caution – staggered over nearly nine months, it will not be open to all international tourists and travellers until October 2022. “Our restrictions there have served us well as a country, but they were only ever intended to be temporary. I think everybody would agree it’s not feasible to keep those kinds of restrictions in place for a prolonged period,” he says “If anything, I think most of us wouldn’t have envisioned they would be in place for as long as they have been.” The announcement of reopening will not come as a surprise to most New Zealanders. In the last month, pressures at the border had been boiling over. The story of Charlotte Bellis – a pregnant journalist who had approached the Taliban to stay in Afghanistan after initially being declined entry to New Zealand – had made international headlines. Other stories, of families divided, children unable to visit terminally-ill parents, people stranded without visas or jobs, had been accumulating. A group of citizens stranded overseas had brought a court case against the government, challenging the legality of barring them from entry. Finally, the spread of Omicron within New Zealand’s borders meant strict policies to keep it out looked increasingly untenable. “I don’t have any regrets about the concept of having MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine],” Hipkins says. “[But] we’re acutely aware of the pressure that’s built up while there have been these restrictions.” The border had become a festering sore point in the country’s policy, with those overseas arguing the lottery for quarantine was arbitrary, unfair, and inhumane. “I would acknowledge how difficult it’s been for them – and I’ll actually say thank you to them on behalf of the whole country, who because of the sacrifices that they have made have been able to enjoy a much greater degree of freedom,” Hipkins says. “There have been fewer funerals, because of what we’ve been able to achieve with our Covid-19 response and the sacrifice that they have made has been a big part of that. I don’t for a moment underestimate what a sacrifice [that] has been for some people.” “I think New Zealanders do accept that we can’t live a life of suspended animation indefinitely,” Hipkins says. The change in the Covid response also means a tipping of the balance, away from New Zealand’s highly centralised, government-mandated response, to one that falls more in the realm of individual responsibility. “It is going to be a big shift. It’s going to take everybody a little while to get their heads around the new realities, and how things will be different. But we’re well prepared,” Hipkins says. In speeches, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has called it a shift toward “individual armour of the vaccine” – while New Zealand’s initial response depended on the fortress walls protecting everyone inside, its new strategy means people need to strap on their own chainmail – vaccines, boosters, isolation plans, mask supplies. Epidemiologists and health experts say the shift to individual protection also has far more scope to leave people behind – those who either won’t, or can’t don their own armour. That includes children too young to be vaccinated, marginalised groups with less access to healthcare and lower vaccination rates, the immuno-compromised, and those with multiple health issues. “The problem is that vaccine coverage is patterned by inequality,” says epidemiologist Michael Baker. So too, he says, are most protections against the pandemic: social distancing, access to high-quality masks, the ability to isolate. “Despite this rhetoric about addressing inequities and attending to the needs of Māori and the concern that Māori and Pacific people are the most vulnerable, the reality is that we haven’t really implemented programmes effectively,” says associate professor and public health specialist Dr Colin Tukuitonga. “And so we saw for example, in the vaccination rollout, huge discrepancies with the lowest rates among Māori and Pacific people.” Some of those inequities started to close when the government gave more control to Māori and Pacific providers, he said – but the same problems are now cropping up in the paediatric rollout, with uptake among Māori and Pācific children less than half the rate among European. “Because potentially half of the population will get infected over the next few months, they are going to have poorer outcomes that are unfortunately now built in – because of the sequence of events and because of longstanding inequities,” says Baker. “We’re aware that vaccination rates have been slower in our Māori and Pacific communities,” Hipkins said – and noted that his office would be meeting with Māori and Pacific groups this week, to see how they could improve. Asked if that was too little, too late, Hipkins says the government had been meeting with iwi (tribal) and Pacific health providers throughout the pandemic, and the current stage was a fine-tuning rather than a last-minute scramble. “I guess I’d liken it to, say, even when the space rocket’s ready for launch, you can never triple-check enough to make sure that everything’s in place and that you have identified every last potential thing that might go wrong or that might need more work,” he says. Rocket enthusiasts might note that even double-checked vessels occasionally burst into flame upon liftoff, and public health experts have long been arguing that inequalities in the vaccine rollout may have devastating consequences. “It’s an avoidable problem that people have been talking about since the pandemic started – we must address these inequities,” Baker says. “I think we have failed to do that.” While some New Zealanders will be celebrating the lifting of border restrictions and the chance to celebrate with friends and family, others are anxious about what comes next. Hipkins says New Zealanders are prepared for the wave to come. “I think kiwis are at this stage now where they’re sort of saying, well, we know what’s coming. We’re ready. We kind of just want to get on with it and get to the other side. I think kiwis are ready for it.”",News/World news,‘We’re all nervous’: NZ’s Covid tsar Chris Hipkins admits uncertainty over border reopening,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/were-all-nervous-nzs-covid-tsar-chris-hipkins-admits-uncertainty-over-border-reopening
