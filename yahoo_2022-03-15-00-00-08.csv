3/15/2022,"Almond Brewer was surrounded by Arizona police after a credit union manager doubted the authenticity of an account holder’s check. Authorities were called on a Black Arizona man attempting to cash a check he received after selling a boat. The man, Almond Brewer, went to Pinal County Federal Credit Union in Apache Junction to cash the $3,200 check only to be surrounded by police after a manager doubted its authenticity. According to a local report from 12 News, the incident occurred in October 2021 when the credit union manager called 911 — while Brewer waited — and told them the personal check was fake. The report notes that Brewer told the teller he had received the check after selling his boat to a woman on Facebook Marketplace, “and she looked kind of surprised.” According to the bank, the check had “red flags” like an old log of the credit union, as well as a routing and checking account number that didn’t match the member’s information. However, after running the check through a third-party verifier, its authenticity was deemed “inconclusive,” a fact the manager did not tell the police. When contacted by the credit union — after the police had been called — the account holder verified she’d signed the check, but police didn’t learn that until 10 minutes into their interaction with a stunned Brewer. “It was just, ‘oh, you know, Black guy locks in his hair, tattoos, came on a Harley, you know?'” Brewer told 12 News. “Let’s assume the worst.” “Why embarrass somebody like that? Why, you know, make them feel less than a man,” he later wondered. In a statement, issued in January, Amy Marshall, president and CEO of the Pinal County Federal Credit Union, said that “at no time did the staff feel threatened or feel Mr. Brewer was trying to rob the credit union.” She noted that police were already en route when the manager got the verbal check verification from its customer and maintained the staff apologized to both the law enforcement officials who responded and to Brewer himself. They had “seen an uptick in fraudulent activity,” Marshall wrote, and their “ultimate responsibility” is to ensure safe and secure accounts. She added that their team undergoes diversity and inclusion training and said they would be reviewing their processes. “Mr. Brewer, on behalf of Pinal County Federal Credit Union,” she concluded, “I would like to formally apologize for this confusing experience while visiting one of our branch locations.” The situation is reminiscent of a recent, now-viral incident involving Black Panther director Ryan Coogler, who was handcuffed by police in Georgia while attempting to withdraw $12,000 from his checking account at a Bank of America branch.

3/15/2022,"China appears to be losing the battle to contain COVID-19, but it’s not yet ready to admit defeat. Facing the worst national outbreak since the first wave of the pandemic, authorities have introduced lockdown restrictions in cities across the country, with production lines falling idle in the tech hub of Shenzhen and offices shuttered in the financial capital Shanghai. Under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has stuck to a strict zero-COVID policy since the virus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, locking down entire cities whenever cases emerge and using mass testing and strict quarantining to bring local outbreaks under control. But Chinese virologists say the arrival of the Omicron variant and its new “stealth” subvariant—both of which appear to evade China’s Sinovac vaccine—could leave that policy in tatters. For those in the Americas or Europe, the case numbers reported from China still seem pretty small: authorities confirmed 1,337 new locally transmitted cases in mainland China on Monday. By contrast, the U.K. is currently seeing more than 200,000 cases a day, according to the main COVID tracker. But the example of Hong Kong, the former British colony that is officially semi-autonomous, is worrying. Omicron appears to be running virtually unchecked through the population of the island territory, which has registered an average of 40,000 cases a day over the past week despite widespread vaccination. Worst-hit on the mainland is the northeastern province of Jilin, bordering North Korea, where many residents are restricted to their homes except for grocery shopping trips every other day. Jilin has recorded more than 4,000 cases in the past fortnight. But multiple smaller outbreaks have also been recorded. Shenzhen, a city of 17.5 million people bordering Hong Kong, registered 66 new cases on Saturday, prompting authorities to suspend public transport, close factories—among them the huge Foxconn plant that produces the Apple iPhone. Residents have been told to stay home for the next week except when they are called for three rounds of compulsory testing. A prominent infectious disease expert from Shanghai, Zhang Wenhong, said in an article for the Chinese business outlet Caixin that the outbreak was being driven by the Omicron BA.2 “stealth” subvariant, the most infectious lineage yet of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. The Only Way to Resolve the Wuhan ‘Lab Leak’ Controversy Dr Zhang, whose plain-spoken appeals for people to put up with lockdown restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic made him a prominent figure, said that the case numbers suggested the beginning of an “exponential rise”—but China had no option but to try to contain the virus. “If our country opens up quickly now, it will cause a large number of infections in people in a short period of time,” Zhang wrote, according to a translation carried by the Associated Press. “No matter how low the death rate is, it will still cause a run on medical resources and a short-term shock to social life, causing irreparable harm to families and society.” Foxconn, Apple’s manufacturing partner, said it would use its “diversified production sites in China” to minimize the impact of the Shenzhen lockdown. But from a wider economic viewpoint, the lockdowns—both in Shenzhen and the industrial hub of Dongguan—could hardly have come at a worst time. Panic selling saw Chinese tech stocks listed on the Hong Kong fall 11 percent on Monday—their worst single-day fall since the 2008 crash—because of wider fears that China could be dragged into the conflict in Ukraine, or that Chinese companies doing business in Russia might face Western sanctions. If China sticks with its zero-COVID policy, despite the spread of Omicron, one option is to insist that manufacturers introduce “closed management” systems, where workers live and work in a COVID-free “bubble.” The Chinese used such a system to protect last month’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, where staff and volunteers wore hazmat suits to marshal and test visiting athletes and even robots to feed them. Making that work in a megacity like Shenzhen or Shanghai would be harder. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

3/15/2022,"A teacher in the Atlanta suburb of East Point was disciplined for restraining a female student after she knocked a phone out of his hand. Despite the teenage Black girl being “belligerent,” “aggressive,” and later being found to have had a gun on school property, the coach was fired. Kenneth Miller, the Tri-Cities High School athletics director, claims he was notified on Aug. 20, 2021, by his principal that there was a possibility that guns were brought onto the school’s campus during one of the team’s pep rallies. While trying to locate the weapons on the school’s property, Miller intervened in the detention of a female student. Miller’s attorney says he saw the student earlier on security footage passing a backpack to another student. Police bodycam video shows the girl surrounded by police officers and other eyewitnesses in an office, and at some point the agitated teen lost control of her emotions and struck a cellphone out of Miller’s hand. In response he grabbed her by her shoulders and slammed her against a whiteboard. She shoved him back wildly, and he hit the bookcase. The assembled police officers then tased the girl. After the altercation, it was discovered that the student had a loaded gun. However, since school officials are not allowed to grab students like that, he was fired. Eventually, after a few months, the school district reversed the decision and gave him back his job. Miller is not back at the school coaching but has been suspended for 20 days. Fulton County Schools released a statement about their decision, stating that what he did to the girl could have violated “portions of the Georgia Professional Standard Commission.” It also said in part, “The district administration does not support Mr. Miller’s actions relating to this event and believes his conduct failed to meet the professional expectations it has for employees.” “Mr. Miller inappropriately intervened in a student matter being handled by school administrators and law enforcement,” it continued. “Mr. Miller acted outside of the scope of his authority and responsibilities.” Miller disagrees and claims he handled the situation with the teenager that he called, “very belligerent” in accordance with the district’s policy. “That young lady later became very belligerent, screaming, yelling, cursing, slaps my hand, and hits me,” he claimed to local station CBS 46. “And I restrained her.” “I feel like accepting a suspension is totally unacceptable. Simply because I don’t feel like I did anything wrong,” Miller said. He said in a different interview, “I don’t feel like I did anything wrong. I only adhered to what Fulton County School Board Policy says you’re allowed to do.” The teacher noted that because he helped locate firearms on the school’s property, including the weapon that belonged to the young lady he grabbed, he “saved lives.” He further believes that with students carrying weapons to class, he and everyone around him were in a “hostile environment.” “Anytime you have a gun and weapons on campus, plus a hostile environment where students have already been in altercations that day and things of that nature, yes, we could have possibly prevented something.” Miller doesn’t believe he should be suspended for the top-of-the-school-year incident and has hired representation, Allen Lightcap. Miller describes his suspension as “taking money out of my family’s mouth.” Lightcap contends that the school stopped the termination hearing and decided to pursue suspension last year. In this scenario, Miller will not have an opportunity to defend himself before the court. Lightcap argues that should Miller go through with the termination hearing he might be able to clear his name. The lawyer has another suggestion that will allow the school district and Miller some rest. He says, “Drop the termination. Drop the suspension. Put him back to work at Tri-Cities High School.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,Georgia High School Teacher Fired for Manhandling ‘Belligerent’ Student with a Weapon Gets His Job Back with a Suspension: ‘I Don’t Feel Like I Did Anything Wrong’,https://news.yahoo.com/georgia-high-school-teacher-fired-123000859.html
3/15/2022,"By Maayan Lubell JERUSALEM (Reuters) -A jet suspected to be used by sanctioned oligarch Roman Abramovich was in Israel on Monday, but the foreign minister said the country was not a haven for Russian businessmen subject to international asset freezes over the invasion of Ukraine. Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Israel's financial, banking and aviation authorities were coordinating on the issue. ""Israel will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other Western countries,"" Lapid said in a statement during a visit to Slovakia, which borders Ukraine. A person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters a plane used by Russian billionaire Abramovich flew into Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, confirming reports in Israeli media. The foreign ministry statement did not mention the jet. A spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the plane. Reuters could not immediately establish whether Abramovich, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, had been aboard. The plane was due to leave Israel later on Monday, the source said. The arrival of the aircraft was a sign of the fine line that Israel has been walking in its relations with Russia - a powerbroker in neighbouring Syria. The billionaire, owner of Britain's Chelsea soccer club, was among seven oligarchs added to the British sanctions list on Thursday in a bid to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich has denied having close ties to Putin. A British transport ministry source said on Friday that Britain was searching out helicopters and jets belonging to the sanctioned oligarchs. CALL FOR SANCTIONS In an interview with Israel's Channel 12 on Friday, Victoria Nuland, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, said Washington was asking Israel to join in financial and export sanctions against Russia. Lapid did not say directly whether Israel was considering its own sanctions. But he said the foreign ministry was ""coordinating the issue together with partners including the Bank of Israel, the Finance Ministry, the Economy Ministry, the Airports Authority, the Energy Ministry, and others"". Asked for further details, the Bank of Israel said in a statement to Reuters that it was ""constantly monitoring developments in the payments systems, the markets, and the financial system."" Any Israeli sanctions could complicate efforts by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to mediate the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. He held talks in Moscow with Putin on March 5 and has spoken several times by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ""There is no justification for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and there is no justification whatsoever for attacks on a civilian population,"" said Lapid, who has been one of the most outspoken cabinet members in condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a further bid to prevent Russian oligarchs from evading foreign sanctions, Israel this month restricted the time private jets can park to no more than 24 hours. With public sympathy for Ukraine strong in Israel, the country's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem said on Thursday that it had suspended a strategic partnership with Abramovich, after Britain's move against him.

3/15/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warns it's ""only a matter of time"" before Russian missiles strike a NATO country, amid reports that Russia's invading forces had escalated airstrikes on western Ukraine over Sunday night. Driving the news: Zelensky said in a televised address that Sunday was a ""black"" day as Russian missiles struck from ""east to west"" and hit a military training base near Ukraine's border with Poland, killing 35 people and wounded 134 others, per an English translation provided by the president's office. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. Zelensky again called for a no-fly zone — which Western leaders have repeatedly ruled out due to concerns about escalating the war and potentially bringing NATO into a conventional conflict with a nuclear power. ""If you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory,"" Zelensky said. ""On the homes of citizens of NATO countries."" State of play: ""Indiscriminate Russian shelling and air attacks are causing widespread destruction,"" per a U.K. Ministry of Defense intelligence update Monday. ""Russian naval forces have established a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade,"" the defense ministry said in an update Sunday evening. ""Russian naval forces are also continuing to conduct missile strikes against targets throughout Ukraine. Russia has already conducted one amphibious landing in the Sea of Azov and could look to conduct further such operations in the coming weeks."" U.K. Ministry of Defense By the numbers: 30 missiles struck the Lviv region of western Ukraine alone on Sunday, where the bombarded Yavoriv military base is located, according to Zelensky. Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed to have killed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries"" in the region and vowed to continue with strikes, per the Washington Post, which notes the claims could not be verified. The big picture: While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, Poland is and U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday that the U.S. would ""defend every inch of NATO territory."" He said even if an accidental shot struck a NATO member country, the ""alliance would respond to that."" What to watch: Negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian officials resumed on Monday. Wendy Sherman, deputy secretary of state, told ""Fox News Sunday"" Russian officials had shown a ""willingness to have real, serious negotiations.""

3/15/2022,"Nobody wants to hear the word cancer from their doctor, but in many cases it's no longer the death sentence it once was thanks to new treatments and early detection screenings. That said, cancer cases are rising according to Dr. Liudmila Schafer, an associate professor of medicine and published board-certified medical oncologist specializing in gastrointestinal cancers with over 20 years of experience and founder of The Doctor Connect who spoke with Eat This, Not That! Health. ""The field of oncology is rapidly growing as the average age of the U.S. population steadily rises and the number of patients diagnosed with cancer continues to increase. Although the median age at diagnosis is 71 years and 40% of cases diagnosed are in patients older than 75, there have been increasing incidences of colon cancer among people younger than 50. Globally, five-year survival rates for all cancers increased from 50.5 to 67 percent."" Dr. Schafer explained to ETNT! Heath what cancer signs to watch out for and why cancer is more treatable today. Read on—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had COVID. 1 Dr. Schafer says, ""wasting syndrome is the loss of fat and muscle that causes weight loss. Cancer causes the immune system to release chemicals into the blood that causes inflammation and speed the process of loss of fat and muscle, commonly in cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, and pancreas."" 2 ""It happens because the mucosa of the gut gets damaged as a barrier,"" says Dr. Schafer. ""Cancer inside the bowel weakens the lining that is the barrier to the gastrointestinal tract. Cancers in the esophagus, stomach, colon, or rectum may cause bleeding."" 3 Dr. Schafer explains, ""Mass in the colon keeps your stool from moving through in its normal shape as a sign of colon cancer. "" 4 According to Dr. Schafer, ""Cancer in the colon or rectum causes stretching of the bowel wall and causes pain or spasms. Cancer can make holes in the colon wall that cause pain in the belly."" 5 ""In the colon, tumors can prevent the digestive contents from moving forward, causing the food to go back up. For this reason, nausea and vomiting occur,"" says Dr. Schafer.  6 Dr. Schafer explains, ""Cancer is much more treatable today because of awareness of the symptoms early. If you're able to detect early, you will have a less-invasive surgery, with a faster recovery time, fewer medical bills, a greater chance for long-term survival, and a normal and healthy life. We have made great strides in recent years to treat cancer because there are promising new advances in colon cancer research, including an active clinical trial to create a more personalized treatment. Just because you're diagnosed with Colon Cancer, doesn't mean you should make premature decisions based on what you've heard from someone else with the disease. Make sure to ask your doctor about molecular tests that help identify which clinical trial you're eligible for."" RELATED: Virus Experts Sound Alarm Over These Unknowns 7 To prevent cancer, schedule a screening,"" Dr. Schafer states. ""People don't like to ""show their butt,"" but scheduling a colonoscopy is a very safe and necessary procedure that can literally save your life. Despite the age being 45 years old, we recommend anyone younger than 45 who is experiencing symptoms to get screened as well."" RELATED: Here's How to Stop Aging, Say Experts 8 It's important that people talk to their family and learn their family history,"" Dr. Schafer reminds us. ""It's not just imperative to know if Colon Cancer runs in the family, but if you have other cancers in your family, then you can potentially have the gene that can precipitate any kind of cancer related to this gene."" RELATED: The #1 Cause of Diabetes 9 ""The encouraging news: there are steps we all can take to reduce our risks and pay attention to the signs someone has cancer,"" Dr. Schafer states. ""The good news is you have many lifestyle choices when it comes down to cancer risk and quitting smoking! Did you know there are 16 cancers that can be caused by smoking? Also, a healthy and balanced diet along with exercise are key factors in determining whether someone has an increased or decreased chance of developing any type of solid tumor.""
