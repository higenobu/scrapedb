1/21/2022,"A woman whose tongue was partially replaced by a piece of her thigh due to cancer is opening up about her journey, including via a number of increasingly popular TikTok clips. 42-year-old Cameron Weeks Newsom—as mentioned in a Newsflare-citing report from the New York Post this week—suffered from severe pain following a 2013 diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, which is the second-most common form of skin cancer. Prior to the diagnosis, Newsom—who credits her family, including husband Anthony and son Hudson, with helping through a difficult time—noticed white spots that formed on her tongue. The spots initially tested negative for cancer, with additional spots showing up the following year. Those spots also tested negative, though Newsom’s symptoms continued to get worse. Ultimately, a specialist diagnosed Newsom with stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma. While treatment proved successful, Newsom said she still needed to have the tumor removed by way of having a portion of her tongue cut out. As part of an hours-long procedure at the University of Texas’ MD Anderson Cancer Center, the removed part of Newsom’s tongue was replaced with muscle and skin that doctors took from her thigh. According to Newsom, “The weirdest part of the whole experience was when I felt a rough texture on the thigh part of my tongue—and when I looked in the mirror it had started growing leg hair!” As captured in a TikTok-shared video, Newsom was recently asked to elaborate on the surgery, as well as detail what could have happened had she not gone that route. “No one told me or gave me the option to not have my tongue replaced,” Newsom said, as seen in the clip above. “They just said that I needed to have it in order to have a functional life. … I would only have that much of a tongue so I can’t imagine what my speech would be like without it.” In recent days, Newsom has also fielded additional questions about the procedure, including from a TikTok user seeking advice on how best to support someone going through a similar experience. “Anything that you can do to be by their side is so helpful,” Newsom said.

1/21/2022,"Of course, Sen. Mitch McConnell made a gaffe on Thursday when he said that African-Americans were voting at the same rate as Americans, leaving out the word “white.” But sometimes gaffes have a way of stating the truth. McConnell was explaining why democracy was in fine shape, despite the failure of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to progress in the U.S. Senate. And for white Americans, the rich white ones that Mitch works hard to represent, that’s probably true. Attempts to overturn the filibuster — used many times against civil rights legislation — failed. McConnell thinks we should suspend the filibuster only when he’s trying to pack the U.S. Supreme Court as he did in 2017. For “other” Americans, the ones whose interests are not such a priority for McConnell, democracy doesn’t look so robust. So far, 19 state legislatures have passed 34 laws that add new voting restrictions. The federal bill would attempt to restore federal oversight of states that have had historical problems with allowing minorities to vote, such as Alabama, where John Lewis almost died at the hands of state troopers when he marched for the rights of Black people to vote. Democrats like Sen. Rand Paul challenger Charles Booker jumped on McConnell: “Mitch has never cared about us. And today, he just happened to speak his mind, and said the quiet part out loud.” He’s right. Restrictions on who can vote and how overwhelmingly hurt poor and minority voters, the ones who propelled Biden to victory. It took the federal government to ensure everyone the right to vote in the 1960s, and it will take the federal government to keep that right intact, it seems. To his credit, McConnell does not support the Big Lie that Trump won the 2020 election, but other Republicans are doing all they can to make it harder to vote. In Florida, for example, they’ve proposed a new police force to oversee elections to better root out the non-existent fraud they insist happened in 2020. When McConnell makes gaffes like this, it just confirms many people’s suspicions that some Republicans — who are also trying to block schools’ teaching of this very history because it might make white people feel bad — don’t really think anyone but white people should be part of our political system.",Politics/Lexington Herald-Leader,"With gaffe on voting rights, Mitch McConnell confirms what many already fear",https://news.yahoo.com/gaffe-voting-rights-mitch-mcconnell-203843704.html
1/21/2022,"By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus on Thursday raised the stakes in a dispute with one of its largest customers, Qatar Airways, over grounded and undelivered A350 jets by announcing it had revoked a separate contract for 50 smaller A321s the airline needs to open new routes. The move is expected to deepen a dispute that moved closer towards a rare courtroom clash on Thursday, with a procedural hearing over Qatar's claim for $600 million in compensation over A350 flaws pencilled in for the week of April 26 in London. Airbus revealed it was walking away from the contract for A321neos in skeletal arguments presented during a scheduling session over the A350 dispute at a division of Britain's High Court on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said. ""We confirm we did terminate the contract for 50 A321s with Qatar Airways in accordance with our rights,"" an Airbus spokesman said following a filing setting out provisional arguments, reported earlier by Bloomberg News. Qatar Airways is expected to fight the A321 contract's termination, having said it plans to take delivery of the jets even though it is refusing to take more A350s until a dispute over surface erosion on the larger planes has been resolved. The airline had no immediate comment on the A321 contract. The A321 order stems from a deal first signed some 10 years ago which was then worth $4.6 billion at list prices. It was later modified to switch 10 of the A321s to a newer version. Qatar Airways has said the A321s will help it launch flights to new markets where there is currently not enough demand for larger aircraft, but which are out of reach of smaller A320s. GROUNDING DISPUTE The two companies have been locked in a row for months over A350 damage including blistered paint, cracked window frames or riveted areas and erosion of a layer of lightning protection. Qatar Airways says its national regulator has ordered it tostop flying 21 out of its 53 A350 jets as problems appeared,prompting a bitter dispute with Airbus which has said that whileit acknowledges technical problems, there is no safety issue. Qatar Airways is seeking $618 million in compensation for the 21 grounded jets plus $4 million a day as the row drags on. The Gulf carrier is also asking British judges to orderFrance-based Airbus not to attempt to deliver any more of thejets until what it describes as a design defect has been fixed. Airbus has said it will ""deny in total"" the complaint and has accused Qatar Airways, once one of its most highly courted customers, of mislabelling the problem as a safety concern. It has indicated it will argue that state-owned Qatar Airways influenced its regulator to ground the jets to win compensation, while Qatar Airways has questioned the design and accuses Airbus of failing to produce studies, the people said. Qatar Airways has said its local regulator is independently driving safety decisions and cannot evaluate the airworthiness of the affected jets without a deeper analysis from Airbus. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, which is responsible for the overall design but not the locally regulated airworthiness of individual planes in service, has said it has not so far found safety problems with A350s that it inspected. Qatar is so far the only country to ground some of the jets. But a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/costly-airbus-paint-flaw-goes-wider-than-gulf-2021-11-29 in November revealed at least five other airlines had discovered paint or surface flaws since 2016, prompting Airbus to set up an internal task force before the Qatar row, and to explore a new A350 anti-lightning design.
