1/16/2022,"The BBC licence fee will be abolished in 2027 and the broadcaster’s funding will be frozen for the next two years, the government has said, in an announcement that will force the broadcaster to close services and make further redundancies. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, will announce that the cost of an annual licence, required to watch live television and access iPlayer services, will remain at £159 until 2024 before rising slightly for the following three years.  She also said this would be the end of the current licence fee funding model for the BBC, raising doubts about the long-term future of the public broadcaster under a Conservative government. Dorries said: “This licence fee announcement will be the last. The days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors are over. Time now to discuss and debate new ways of funding, supporting and selling great British content.” The announcement was briefed to the media as part of a range of measures designed to shore up public support for Boris Johnson after he faced calls to resign as prime minister. The BBC will have to negotiate with the government over an entirely new funding model when the final licence fee funding deal expires in 2027 – raising the prospect of a subscription service or part-privatisation. The Mail on Sunday quoted an ally of Dorries as saying: “There will be a lot of anguished noises about how it will hit popular programmes, but they can learn to cut waste like any other business. This will be the last BBC licence fee negotiation ever. Work will start next week on a mid-term review to replace the charter with a new funding formula. “It’s over for the BBC as they know it.” The source added that “the days of state-run TV are over” and praised the growth of US-run companies such as Netflix and YouTube. Although the BBC will continue to receive £3.2bn a year in licence fee income, the costs of making its programmes are increasing rapidly due to rising inflation and competition from the likes of Netflix. As a result, the corporation will have to make hundreds of millions of pounds in spending cuts in order to balance its books. The BBC has already made substantial cuts behind the scenes, meaning the next round of cuts are likely to hit on-air services. As a result the public should prepare for the BBC to provide less high-end drama and sports coverage, pad schedules with cheaper programmes, and potentially close some channels or services altogether. This could in turn erode support for the BBC if the public no longer feel they are receiving value-for-money from the licence fee. The licence fee deal will cover a five- year period to 2027, with the cost to the public likely to increase in the final three years – although this increase could also be at a below-inflation rate, meaning further cuts to BBC output could be required. Dorries’ allies said there would be no further licence fee deal under a Johnson government and they would look to find a new funding model for the corporation. Calls for the BBC to become a paid-for subscription service have always been undermined by the widespread popularity of broadcast radio and Freeview television services, which cannot be put behind a paywall. The BBC has already been preparing for the end of the licence fee, with proposals including a universal levy on broadband subscriptions or funding the broadcaster with a grant from general taxation – although this could undermine its editorial independence and leave it even more at the whim of government funding. Negotiations over the amount the BBC can charge for the licence fee having been ongoing for some time, with a final deal delayed by Dorries’ appointment in the autumn. The government has placed substantial pressure on the corporation’s news output, claiming it is biased against the government, at the same time as negotiating over the corporation’s financial future. The BBC has faced repeated deep real-terms spending cuts since the start of the Tory/LibDem coalition government in 2010, with the Conservatives forcing the BBC to pay for free licences for the over-75s – then blaming the BBC when they took the benefit away. A BBC source said of the licence fee proposals: “There has been similar speculation before. There are very good reasons for investing in what the BBC can do for the British public, and the creative industries and the UK around the world. Anything less than inflation would put unacceptable pressure on the BBC finances after years of cuts.”",News/Media,BBC licence fee to be abolished in 2027 and funding frozen,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/16/bbc-licence-fee-to-be-abolished-in-2027-and-funding-frozen
1/16/2022,"Twenty years ago an architectural bomb went off in Hackney, east London. It was a small and charming bomb, with no reported casualties, in a colour somewhere between baby blue and sky blue, with curious shapes – old Dutch gables inspired by a postcard of Amsterdam, the outline of a tree, a child’s idea of a house – cut into its boarded exterior. But it performed an act then outrageous in architectural circles, of reviving postmodernism, the decorative style tainted by its association with the bloated office buildings and shopping malls of 1980s corporate excess. The Blue House, as it is called, helped to bring some fame though not much fortune to its architects, Fashion Architecture Taste, or FAT, until they announced their breakup in 2013. It didn’t, though, greatly alter the trajectory of architecture. It didn’t launch a revolution of what you might call postpostmodernism. Its big idea was that architecture could be like pop art, that it could combine artistic sophistication with a direct appeal to everyday culture, that it could riff on themes from notable architects of the past while offering imagery that a child might get. So the gable and tree shapes came with a layered and complex interior that owes something to Adolf Loos and John Soane. The world somehow wasn’t ready for this.  In the past few years, however, there has been a gradual exploration of the waters that FAT boldly entered when the century was young. Postpostpostmodernism, perhaps. One manifestation is the Red House, a new home in Dorset for an art dealer, his accountant husband and their young daughter. It is designed by David Kohn, the architect who, with the artist Fiona Banner, created a temporary one-room, boat-shaped hotel perched on the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. Red House is a long, two-storey oblong with a big, oversailing slate roof. It has high chimneys, curving bays and openings in the shapes of circles and semi-circles. The windows and door of an end elevation recall the eyes and mouth of a face. Complementary colours zing off each other: a vibrant green for the metalwork and timber, and red brick walls. It plainly announces, almost cartoonishly, that it is a house. At the same time it offers clues and diversions for the architecturally learned. It has a clear debt to the Arts and Crafts houses of around 1900, built for enlightened patrons in such places as the Lake District, the Malvern hills or what is now the London green belt. It is particularly reminiscent of CFA Voysey, the leading exponent of that style. It also has a bit of the mid-century Philadelphian Louis Kahn, a romantic devotee of massive masonry, and something of James Stirling, the British architect who from the 1950s until his death in 1992 delighted in clashing powerful forms and colours. Inside, on the first floor, there’s a vaulted corridor inspired by the Villa Necchi Campiglio in Milan, whose exquisite 1930s interiors made a memorable setting for the Tilda Swinton-starring film I Am Love. The house is composed, as in a piece of music, with complexity and difference playing off an overall structure. Inside, there’s an axis running down the centre of the house, leading you towards the views of garden and landscape beyond, around which contrasting spaces are arrayed: a semi-circular dining space, a bright kitchen, a study alcove opening off the first-floor landing, a master bedroom in which the concave curve of the inside of a bay meets the triangular shape of the underside of the roof, to subtle and tent-like effect. A stair with rococo curves connects the two floors. Ample storage spaces, which help to keep the interiors uncluttered and orderly, punctuate the plan. Rooms are high or low, expansive or constricted, with light coming from different angles and views offered in multiple directions. The scale is a little surprising: passages and doors, partly out of a wish to make the house wheelchair accessible, are higher and wider than normal. At the same time the interior is finished with calm and consistent practicality – white-painted concrete block walls and wood block floors – which brings overall coherence to the variety of shapes and spaces. On the outside, bricks are laid horizontally, as is conventional, but sometimes vertically. There’s a logic to this that may be lost to the casual observer, which is that the vertical bricks denote the location of more functional spaces, such as bathrooms and store rooms, that serve the main living spaces. There’s also a slight overhang in the brickwork at first-floor level. Again, it’s a nicety that many won’t notice, but even though this and the brick patterns add to the cost, Kohn’s clients were happy to pay for it. The house is (among other things) a work of art, is their view, and its architect should be trusted to do it his way. Both the Blue House and the Red House play with your expectations of scale, surface and appearance. What looks flat might be substantial, and vice versa. In both, the outside tells you something about the inside, but not precisely. The Blue House, which included a studio as well as a home, has both the gridded windows of a workplace and domestic pitched-roof shapes, but they don’t correspond to the locations of these uses within. The Red House is the politer of the two, where the multiple elements are more assimilated with one another. The Blue House takes greater pleasure in its incongruities, to which another layer has now been added. It was originally built for Sean Griffiths, one of FAT’s founders, and his then-partner, the landscape architect Lynn Kinnear. The two no longer live together, but Griffiths has designed for Kinnear an internal makeover and an extension at the top of the house that includes a contemplative study opening on to a roof garden. The new work is completely different from the original, but it has the same spirit. Here, new materials and colours are added to what was already a rich palette – pebbledash walls, a profiled metal roof, pink, yellow, green. The rooftop structure adds another house shape to those already present, plus a somewhat brutalist projecting window. “A beach house on the roof”, Kinnear calls it, and the interior is a surprisingly serene escape, with views of London chimneys and towers. “What the rest would have been like if I’d been a good architect back then” is how Griffiths describes it. Kohn doesn’t see himself as a disciple of FAT, exactly, but he shares some of their interests and appreciates their “huge generosity”. He says that they “did a brilliant job of expanding architecture, of trying to prise open what’s fair game. It was a project for recovering a lot of lost fun.” Perhaps now, at last, the architectural world is ready to hear their messages.",Arts/Art and design,"Red House, Dorset: the shape of post-post-postmodernism?",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/16/red-house-dorset-the-shape-of-post-post-postmodernism
1/16/2022,"No one knows what awaited Kim Woo-joo when he arrived back in North Korea, just over a year after he had fled the world’s most oppressive regime for a life of freedom in the South. Earlier this month, the 29-year-old former gymnast approached the border separating the two Koreas, scaled a tall barbed-wire fence and walked the 2.5 miles across the heavily armed demilitarised zone (DMZ), dodging landmines but not security cameras, which captured his escape no fewer than five times.  His decision to cross the DMZ back to the North from the South was the latest chapter in an extraordinary series of journeys. In November 2020, Kim had made the same journey in the opposite direction, fleeing his homeland but shunning the route preferred by almost all defectors across the North’s border with China. Having denied that he was a spy, embarrassed officials in Seoul were forced to acknowledge that Kim had grown so disillusioned with life in South Korea that he was willing to face harassment and possible incarceration in the North by returning there. His daring flight prompted uncomfortable questions about the treatment of political and economic refugees from the North, for whom life in the democratic, capitalist South sometimes falls far short of expectations. At about 20%, the unemployment rate among defectors is six times higher than the average for South Koreans, according to the Database Centre for North Korean Human Rights. Although their average monthly income reached a record high in 2019, it still lags far behind that of South Koreans, the unification ministry said. Last year, 1,582 defectors received financial help in addition to a welfare package they receive when they resettle in the South, while 47% said they were experiencing mental anguish, the ministry said. They may well have included Kim, a night-time office cleaner who did not appear to have any friends and never spoke to his neighbours, one of whom told reporters that he had dutifully left a mattress and other possessions out for collection before he fled. “If you worked in industry or for the government in North Korea, you can’t come to South Korea and expect to do an equivalent job,” says Sokeel Park, South Korea country director of Liberty in North Korea, which helps defectors. “You have to take a hit to your relative status, and that can have an effect on mental health, particularly for North Korean men.” New arrivals spend three months being debriefed to ensure they are not spies, followed by a similar period at Hanawon (house of unity), a settlement support centre where they are given counselling and coached in the practicalities of South Korean life. They are eligible for government subsidies of 20m won (£12,260) to find a home or a place at university, followed by monthly payments of 320,000 won for five years. What is lacking, says Park, is the sense of community that the North – for all its disadvantages – had given them, particularly among people from rural areas who struggle to cope with the anonymity of life in a megalopolis like Seoul. While defectors struggle financially and experience discrimination in education, housing and employment, it doesn’t necessarily follow that their thoughts will turn to redefection, says Park. “It is always a shock when a defector goes back to North Korea, even to other defectors,” he says. Double defections inevitably attract headlines, but they are relatively rare. Of the 33,800 North Koreans who have defected to the South, just 30 have returned to the North. “When you think of how many people are involved, human nature means it is inevitable that some people will have second thoughts,” Park says. “It would be very strange if none of those 30,000 defectors had gone back.” Joo Il-yong was 13 when he left North Korea with his mother and sister, less than a year after his father had arrived in Seoul, where he saved money to enable the rest of his family to escape. Joo, who graduated from Korea University in Seoul and will begin graduate studies there this spring, is a defector success story, but says he understands why a small number of other North Koreans end up back in the country they were once so desperate to leave. “One of the biggest obstacles is the systemic difference between the two countries,” says Joo, who arrived in the South in 2009 after his father decided he wanted his children to live in a country where they would have “opportunities and a future”. The perceived benefits of life in a rich, free society can quickly become a burden, Joo adds. “In North Korea we didn’t have to plan our lives – the state did that for us. But in the South, we have to take responsibility for our own lives. I know from my own experience that resettling in South Korea is a challenge, but it is nowhere near as difficult as living in North Korea.” Some North Koreans return after sustained emotional blackmail from left-behind relatives, under pressure from North Korea’s secret police. “In some cases, it is simply because they miss their families back in North Korea so much,” Joo says. “But I don’t see the challenges of life here as harsh or unfair. In fact, they have made me happier, because they motivate me to work and study even harder.”",News/World news,‘Second thoughts’: what makes North Korean defectors want to go back?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/second-thoughts-what-makes-north-korean-defectors-want-to-go-back
1/16/2022,"Nisha Katona, CEO and executive chef, Mowgli Street Food restaurants  For me, fenugreek is the most alchemical ingredient in the Indian kitchen. It comes in four forms and each does something different to different ingredients. There are some areas of India that use it a lot, like the Punjabis, but we Bengalis use it sparingly and more with vegetables. There are the fenugreek seeds which you use with vegetables such as squashes and pumpkins and potatoes, all of those things that you look at and think, that’s a butter job. Fry the seeds, then toss in your pumpkin, a little bit of turmeric and salt, and cook it down until it’s soft. Heavenly. Then you have the powder. If you’re doing any marinating or barbecuing, like tandoori chicken or masala chops, it will give that extra punch. You only need half a teaspoon for about 10 lamb chops. The fresh leaves you would use in breads such as methi paratha. Chop the leaves and fold them into dough; it’s completely sublime. Then there are the dried leaves – kasoori methi – that go in things like butter chicken. This is the one that changes everything. They barely smell of anything, but add them to hot oil, a curry of any kind, and you can smell it down the driveway. Fenugreek imprints itself on your taste and scent memory. Some people when they smell it say they can smell maple. It doesn’t taste sweet but imagine leafy, woody, autumnal undertones. It enhances the flavours of whatever you cook. Tom Kerridge, chef-owner, The Hand & Flowers, Marlow Honestly, this chilli oil is the naughtiest product in the world; it feels like it is everything that is lush about Chinese food. It’s not too hot and spicy, but it’s clearly chilli. It’s that crunch, that crispness, that saltiness, those lovely umami flavours. I put it on absolutely everything. I order four jars at a time. There’s a black bean one as well but the crispy chilli is texturally the best. I always use it as a condiment to finish, or as a seasoning, because it’s so salty. Anything that’s a bit soft, where you want a bit of crunch on the top, it’s perfect for. On cauliflower cheese, macaroni cheese, sprinkled on an omelette, on cold meats. A couple of nights ago I just put it on a piece of brie. Lush. Ravneet Gill, chef, cookery writer and judge on Junior Bake Off In my house, we always have malt extract and malt powder because my grandma loves to drink it, but I didn’t know you could use it in desserts until I worked at St John. Weirdly, you see it in a lot of pharmacies and they sell it in Holland & Barrett. I use it to add another dimension tocream-based things such as creme brulee and ice-cream, because the flavour of malt and cream and custard work well together. It’s almost like molasses, treacly, so also enhances the texture. It’s good with chocolate in a ganache, and I also like malt powder in a milkshake. It tastes a bit like Horlicks (because obviously that’s malt powder) and Maltesers. Use a hot spoon when you’re weighing it out, and if you want to add it to a recipe, start by taking out 20g of a sweet element and using malt extract instead. See how it tastes, then add as you go. Rukmini Iyer, cookery writer and author of the Roasting Tin series I use Lea & Perrins in anything cheese- or tomato-based or in any kind of marinade. It doesn’t leave you with a detectable fish flavour, but with salt and a roundness of flavour and spice. I found out that my grandma in Kolkata cooked with it more than 50 years ago. She used it when marinating fish. Her secret recipe – which I am putting in my new book – is to marinate prawns in Worcestershire sauce before crumbing and frying them. I do it now and it’s absolutely delicious. It just has so much flavour as a marinade, it enhances the umami. I’ll always put a dash of Worcestershire sauce in cheddar muffins; I like to make everything taste like a Welsh rarebit. It’s a fairly simple mix: flour (I like to use a mixture of spelt and rye flour), grated cheese, yoghurt, a bit of milk, egg, a really good dash of Worcestershire, then sprinkle a bit more grated cheese and Worcestershire on top before baking them. Also, if I’m making something like a tomato sauce and I’ve run out of anchovies, Lea & Perrins in place of them gives that lovely subtle depth of flavour. Just use it a teaspoon at a time to start with. Treat it as you would fish sauce. That is, with caution. Georgina Hayden, cookery writer, author of Taverna: Recipes from a Cypriot Kitchen Limassol, Cyprus, where my paternal yiayia (grandmother) is from, is famous for carob. Cypriots call it “black gold” because historically the production was a big part of the economy. Carob looks like a cross between fresh tamarind and vanilla pods, almost like a dark brown broad bean. They tend to grow in a cluster and the inside is squidgy. It plays an important role in Cypriot food culture. For about a third of the year, Orthodox Greeks fast – we don’t eat animal products – every Wednesday and Friday, and before Easter, Christmas and the Assumption of Mary. My yiayia fasts very strictly and she always has carob syrup in the kitchen, it’s like her sweet fix. It’s often added to cakes and doughs to enrichen them and to make them “healthier” without adding too much excessive sugar. Vegans use it as a chocolate alternative and I understand why. It has the richness you get from cocoa and it’s naturally sweet. I think it works with red meat. If I’m roasting lamb, I’ll finish it with a little bit of carob syrup at the end, to sort of caramelise it. It’s a similar combination to the way you would put a bit of dark chocolate in chilli. It goes really well with tahini. I put carob in tahinopita, swirly tahini breads and babka. Tahini and carob are essentially the original chocolate and peanut butter, an age-old version of Reese’s Pieces. I always add cinnamon too, for me, that’s the holy trinity. Emily Scott, head chef, Emily Scott Food, Watergate Bay, Cornwall Saffron has been used in Cornish cooking for centuries. It is said that the Phoenicians bartered saffron for tin and copper. Saffron cake and yeasty saffron buns – that’s a really Cornish thing. It’s now grown by the Cornish Saffron Company, based on the Roseland peninsula on the south coast. It’s only about 25 miles from where I am, but it’s completely different; it’s not like the rugged north coast of Cornwall. For the crocuses, it’s the perfect environment. Seaweed is used as a fertiliser and the saffron is plucked by hand. It’s expensive, but a little goes a long way. I use it to make saffron aioli. Just add saffron to the mayonnaise and it turns that beautiful burnished yellow colour. It goes so well with tomatoey, fennel fish stew. It’s one of those fish suppers I crave. I love it in risotto as well. We do one in the restaurant; it’s a rich, deep, buttery, parmesan-y risotto with saffron, and we put a crisp fried hen’s egg on top. And I do a monkfish dish with shallots and spring onions as a base. You put monkfish tails into the pan, then add white wine, double cream and a couple of pinches of saffron and just let it reduce. You get the most creamy saffron sauce. It’s one of those ingredients that always feels quite luxurious but is quite versatile. Anna Jones, cookery writer and author of One Pot, One Pan, One Planet I use smoked water to give smoky accents to food that I used to use smoked meats for. It gives a heady, malty, caramel flavour. You have to be gentle with how you use it, as too much can be overpowering. I use it where classically you might use prosciutto, such as vignarola, or vignole, which is covered in a lid of prosciutto. I love all of the spring vegetables in the dish but I’ve always missed that smoky back note. I make a version of vincisgrassi, the beautiful lasagne with mushrooms and prosciutto and use it in that to mimic the flavour. A few drops in an aioli would work brilliantly, and it’s incredible in risottos and my swede carbonara for people who are carbonara lovers but don’t want to eat meat. I often add some smoked water to homemade yoghurt flatbreads. They are quick-rise and easy. You mix 200g plain flour (you could use spelt flour), a good pinch of salt, and a teaspoon of baking powder, then you mix in about 200g Greek yoghurt, add a couple of drops of the smoked water and bring it together with your hands. You don’t need to knead it as you would a normal bread. Cut it into four and roll it out, then cook on a barbecue, in a dry frying pan or in a griddle pan for 3-4 minutes each side, or until they are puffed up and you can see they are cooked in the middle. Shuko Oda, co-founder and executive chef, Koya, London Mirin is an essential condiment in Japanese cooking, it’s used in pretty much every dish – you have to have it in your cupboard if you want to cook any Japanese food. It’s basically a sweetened sake, almost syrupy with a kick of alcohol. Because it isn’t as well known here as soy sauce, for example, I had a chance to think about the different ways you might use it. I always add a bit of mirin to salad dressings. If it’s a western dressing I’ll use olive oil, nice red-wine vinegar, salt, dijon mustard and a touch of mirin. If it’s an Asian kind of dressing I put sesame oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, a bit of sugar and mirin. If you season fried noodles just with soy sauce, there’s no depth, but when you combine it with mirin, it brings more fullness and roundness to it. James Cochran, chef-owner, 12:51 and Around The Cluck, London Agar agar is a natural seaweed extract. It’s a setting agent so is good for vegetarians and vegans. It’s completely flavourless and comes as a white powder. I discovered it when I was working at the Ledbury many moons ago. Because it has no taste, you can make super clean flavours. It’s great with desserts; I make a whipped cheesecake and use it instead of gelatine. For a recipe at home, add 10g of agar agar to 1 litre of clementine juice (it’s usually 1% of what the weight is), bring it to the boil, let it set, then blend it. You could have that with chicken liver parfait and brioche or you could have a confit duck leg, chicory salad, fresh clementines and the clementine gel. Or to make a lemon meringue pie, mix lemon juice, a bit of sugar and the agar agar. Blind bake a pastry case, add the lemon mix, pipe the meringue on and blowtorch it. Giorgio Locatelli, chef-owner, Locanda Locatelli, London I am really attached to this product, as about 10 years ago I spent two nights and three days fishing for gambero rosso prawns in Italy. Their sweetness is unbelievable, a velvety flavour like a lobster that is trying to fall in love with you. They live at such a depth of the sea, that’s why they have this very red colouration. It takes about one hour and 20 minutes to let down the net. When the net comes out of the water, it’s 95% prawns, few other species – incredible. They freeze the prawns on board with a little bit of seawater. Obviously there are different sizes and some people want to buy them without the head (which is a big mistake because that’s where all the flavour is). For the elixir, they take the heads and practically dry freeze them, then they obtain a powder which gets mixed with the oil. A couple of little drops and a whole dish comes alive. Everything from a risotto to any type of pasta to some crostini. Our daughter is very allergic to fish and when she was living with us we didn’t even bring fish home, so this incredible fishy flavour was such a treat for Plaxy [Giorgio’s wife] and me, because even if our daughter was around we could put on a little bit and get that absolutely fantastic sweet flavour. Edson Diaz-Fuentes, chef and co-owner, Santo Remedio, London Chintextle is a traditional Mexican paste, an old-fashioned condiment from Oaxaca. It’s made of a little oil, salt, vinegar, garlic, onion, dried shrimp and this beautiful chilli called pasilla de Oaxaca. It’s ground in a metate – a flat volcanic stone – with a pestle, a kind of mortar and pestle. Pasilla de Oaxaca are in danger of extinction as the farmers are not growing them any more, they are very expensive. It is also possible to use other chillies like chipotle – any other smoky chilli. Traditionally it’s used as a spread. In Oaxaca there are huge tortillas called tlayuda. It’s like a pizza in terms of size and topped with a little bit of chintextle, pork fat, beans, cheese, then lettuce and radishes. But it could be used in a sandwich, or rubbed on vegetables, fish or meat which is then grilled. It adds a smokiness without a smoker. You can mix it with minced meat for burgers, a spoonful of that into the mix will add a different flavour profile. It enhances any dish, it’s like Mexican umami. Nathan Outlaw, chef-owner, Outlaw’s Fish Kitchen and Outlaw’s New Road, Port Isaac Vinegar is probably as important as salt and pepper. It gives balance to everything. We’re in Cornwall and there’s a local cider farm five miles from the restaurant, Haywood Farm. We use their apple cider vinegar for all our pickles. It has a roughness, an almost scrumpy-esque flavour and that acidity comes through nicely in dressings and goes really well with raw and cured fish. I’ve got a small herb garden at the restaurant and once a week I cut anything that’s raggedy and let it steep in the local vinegar. It’s continuous and there’s no recipe for it, it’s just making sure we don’t waste anything. We’ve got one made with hard herbs: rosemary, savory and thyme. And another that’s more aniseedy with tarragon and fennel. We use the herb vinegars as a base for dressings. We have this lovely lobster dressing on at the moment; we make stock from the old shells and heads, then balance it out with a bit of Cornish cream and cider vinegar.",Lifestyle/Food,‘I put it on absolutely everything’: top chefs’ secret ingredients – from malt extract to Lea & Perrins,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/16/top-chefs-secret-ingredients-malt-extract-to-lea-perrins-tom-kerridge-anna-jones
1/16/2022,"It’s one of life’s inevitabilities. The more sequels that stack up in a movie franchise, the more simmering displeasure is stoked within the loyal fanbase for the original film. Unless, of course, the movie takes the route adopted by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick, the screenwriters of the exuberantly violent fifth film in the Scream series, and slyly harnesses that fan fury as a plot device. Scream – the film very pointedly shares a title with the original picture – is, as one horror-savvy character explains, “a requel”, a cross between a reboot and a sequel. As such it comes with a combination of “heritage characters” (Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette return) and new blood. Of the latter, Melissa Barrera is sparky but superficial as Sam, a Woodsboro native with an unfortunate past; Jenna Ortega is her younger sister, Tara, a fan of elevated horror rather than the more conventional “meta-slasher-whodunnit” genre typified by the Stab franchise (the Scream series’s self-referential alter ego).  Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (their comic-horror credentials already proved with the bracingly violent Ready or Not), this instalment revamps for a new generation of genre fans the tried and tested Scream formula of knowing movie references and horror tropes. While this is the smartest, funniest and stabbiest film since the 1996 original, it does feel as though Scream has come full circle, an ouroboros serpent of a franchise that is destined to endlessly devour itself until those testy toxic fans finally lose patience.",Arts/Film,"Scream review – the smartest, funniest instalment since the original",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/16/scream-review-the-smartest-funniest-instalment-since-the-original
1/16/2022,"There’s only one way into Bell Canyon, and one way out. Winding cul-de-sacs peppered with multimillion-dollar homes snake up through the gated, hillside community, which overlooks southern California’s San Fernando Valley. It’s a picturesque and private place to call home that has attracted affluent families and celebrities like Alyssa Milano, Shaquille O’Neal and Joe Rogan.  But the hills of Bell Canyon are also primed to burn. Blackened trees and melted trash cans can still be found here, relics that serve as reminders of the 2018 Woolsey Fire that tore through the region claiming 1,500 structures – including dozens in Bell Canyon – and three lives. Residents say the threat of another disaster lingers in their thoughts every time dry winds gust through the canyons. That’s why Bell Canyon has taken matters into its own hands. In 2020, they created their own fire department crewed by community members. What started out as a group of renegade residents has since grown into a highly organized and trained team. Some were emboldened after staying behind to fight the flames with garden hoses when Woolsey rained down on the community. Others were intrigued by the opportunities to learn emergency response skills. Most are in their mid-50s and many had no prior firefighting experience. But all of them – whether lawyers, creatives, or engineers by day – are now prepared to show up when it matters most. Garrett Clancy, the chief of the Bell Canyon fire crew, is a filmmaker with emergency response experience garnered in the military and views the crew like the minutemen in the Revolutionary war. “We are going to do something – we aren’t just going to sit around,” he says. “Because this is our home. So we are willing to take whatever risk is involved.” Clancy is clear that their role is secondary to that of county emergency crews. But as fires continue to grow in intensity, severity and frequency, firefighters are becoming strained. Now, more individuals and communities are taking protection and prevention into their own hands. “In some of the tragedies we are experiencing in California, no local fire department has enough resources and they have to figure out what they can save and what they can let burn,” says resident Greg McHugh, who has helped spearhead the community’s efforts to protect itself from fire. “Unfortunately that’s the truth – and you need to help yourself.” For neighborhoods like Bell Canyon, the proactive approach is also aided by affluence. A CalFire-affiliated non-profit made $1.3m available in 2021 to support risk-mitigation projects, with dedicated interest in aiding vulnerable communities. But both Bell Canyon’s volunteer department and its fire safety council, a group headed by McHugh that educates the public about protecting their homes from fires, have benefited from wealth within the community. The local Homeowners Association has contributed roughly $25,000 to the new fire department, and neighbors have thrown in hundreds of thousands more. Areas with fewer resources will likely face bigger obstacles that sets them apart from their wealthy neighbors, adding to the divide already being felt when disasters strike. “A substantially less affluent community with no homeowners association would have to find a fiduciary sponsor,” McHugh says, advising those communities to seek help from legal aid offices to procure their own risk-mitigating fire safe council. The crew is staffed by 16 members. They have acquired three trucks, over a mile of hose and communication tools including radios at each of the members’ homes. They regularly run drills out of Bell Canyon’s Equestrian Center. There’s a joke in the department that they acquired their first fire truck only after a member got drunk and impulsively bought it. Clancy recalls when he got the call that the small burgeoning department was suddenly much better equipped. “That was the catalyst to taking a big step forward,” Clancy says. Some members also have official emergency response experience, including Boris Donia, who grew up in Bell Canyon and, at 24 years-old, is the crew’s youngest. Trained as a wildland firefighter, Donia was instrumental in teaching them how to use the equipment and connecting them to training opportunities. Clancy called him for help with their first truck. “They had no clue how to operate it or pump off of it,” Donia says. He now serves as an assistant chief. Even those who aren’t able to fight fires can help out, like 82-year-old Len, one of Bell Canyon’s longtime residents, who maintains the vehicles and outfits the trucks with parts built in a machine shop in his garage. The crew hasn’t fought a big fire yet. But it has performed other services. There have been close to 100 calls already for help. They have relocated rattlesnakes (a common complaint), aided during torrential rains that produced mud and floods, and were the first on the scene when an older man fell off a cliff (the man survived). “People in the community seem grateful that we are there,” Chief Clancy says. “We are doing all the things you might call the regular fire department for.” Noting that it takes county fire departments an additional 10-15 min to reach the community’s gate and another 8 min to get to the farthest homes in the canyon, Clancy is proud that his team acts quickly. “We can get to a scene in a matter of minutes,” he says. “Our motto is first on scene, last to leave,” Donia says of the volunteer crew. “In the event of another Woolsey fire or another small incident brush fire we are here for our community” he adds. “We have taken the time to learn the canyon inside and out.” The crew has helped residents – both old and new – feel safer despite the increasing risks. “I don’t remember always living in fear every time the wind blew,” Ashley Forchelli says of their reality in the aftermath of the ferocious Woolsey Fire. “But I feel like the crew we have now could have stamped out the spread of the fire.” Forchelli said that residents who stayed behind to help fight the Woolsey fire were able to spare some homes, but without proper equipment and training, they did so “on a wing and a prayer”. “Now, people feel almost ready. Like, bring it. We know what to do. We’ve got equipment, we know who to call.” Jane Staley has been among the most vocal of residents in support of the crew. The home she lives in with her husband, where she raised her children, was damaged but not destroyed during the 2018 fire. They have spent years rebuilding, but despair and fear still grips her. “The feeling of helplessness was so extraordinary,” she says, recalling the fire and smoke that filled the sky and the sleepless night spent waiting it out in a nearby McDonalds parking lot. “Now that I have rebuilt, I don’t know,” she says. “I will go down with the ship next time.” But, she adds with a smile, “I feel like now wherever I am I can reach out to Garrett and he’ll give me the update.”",News/World news,The Woolsey fire burned their homes.

1/16/2022,"The former Observer Washington editor and classical music critic Anthony Holden’s memoir of his prolific career is a rip-roaring salute to a bygone age of journalism, with Holden himself firmly at the centre of events. He sets the scene early on, citing Gyles Brandreth’s observation that “Tony Holden is one of my favourite people – except he smokes and drinks all the time.” This self-described “well-brought-up young product of the north-western petit bourgeoisie” is a committed observer, and sometime friend, of the famous. We meet everyone from Sartre to Humphrey Lyttelton in the opening chapters and countless actors, writers and princes appear in subsequent, often score-settling anecdotes.  Holden’s rise to prominence came when long lunches with contacts and editors were de rigueur and where the ambitious and well-connected would be offered lucrative columnist gigs by their friends. Holden revels in this and depicts a time when a writer would be given a six-month paid sabbatical by the Sunday Times to write a book in exchange for the serial rights and where his resignation from the Times – forced out of his position by Murdoch, even as Harold Evans groomed him to be his successor – was front-page news. Some of his reminiscence is entertainingly buccaneering, chiefly his digs at his frequent biographical subject Prince Charles; not only was he one of the few republican royal writers, but his attacks on his subject made him “the most reviled man in England”. Some is baffling: “I would be delighted to work with Billy Bragg on his radical ideas for constitutional reform.” All of it is boastful. His editor might have suggested the removal of lines such as: “For some years now, six-figure advances would remain the sustaining subtext of my increasingly expensive life.” But just as you start to resent Holden’s apparently charmed and easy existence, the final chapters upend matters. He suffers a debilitating stroke, loses the ability to walk and is now based in an assisted living facility. His descriptions of his new life, far from his heyday, give this enjoyable, if vain, book a poignancy and pathos it might otherwise lack.

1/16/2022,"Chief pie-maker, Holborn Dining Room, London  Nokx Majozi remembers well the very first pie she cooked at the Holborn Dining Room. “It was a grouse, chicken mousse and girolles pithivier,” she says, looking slightly misty-eyed at the memory. That was back in 2014. Today, aged 42, she is number two to executive chef Calum Franklin. She runs the famed Pie Room with its slab marble work surfaces and its shiny copper moulds. The production of the bronzed pastry-clad wonders filled with pork or mutton or cheese and onion and many other things besides is down to her. She also regularly runs service for the whole dining room. “We call her Chief Pie Maker,” Franklin says simply. It’s all a very long way from her beginnings in Durban, South Africa. “My father was the one who cooked when I was kid,” Majozi says. “I started cooking with him because it meant I got to spend time alone with him away from my four siblings.” Not that her parents were delighted when the kitchen became her choice of career. “They wanted me to be a nurse or a doctor.” But she was determined. She finished her training and went to work in hotels first in South Africa, then at Disney World in Florida before coming to London. “It was closest to France, but it was also a place where I spoke the language.” She stayed, putting in serious time at both the Intercontinental and then the Landmark hotels before arriving at the Holborn Dining Room and learning the way of the pie. “It’s the detail I love,” she says. “And the creativity. To be honest I now feel the pie room is mine. Not to be cocky but it’s my small palace.” She also runs the pie-making classes. “The first time I did that I did wonder how that had happened. But the people in the class just want to learn and don’t care where you have come from.” She recognises, however, that where she has come from and who she is, makes her a role model. There are not many women in such senior positions in London restaurant kitchens, let alone black African women. “Kitchens can be much more aggressive places when they are just men,” she says. “Half our brigade are women and they are from all over the world. It makes it a much calmer place. I want women to think of this as a career. We are here and we are doing it.” So, what of the future? “I would like my own cookery school back in South Africa,” she says. But that, she adds, is still some way in the future. She still has so much more to give to London.Holborn Dining Room, 252 High Holborn, London WC1; holborndiningroom.com Head chef, Bubala, London Helen Graham does not have a classic chef origin story. She did not learn to roll gnocchi with her mother, or make tarte tatin with her grandmother. “There were no spices in my house when I was growing up,” she says now, of her north-west London childhood home. Instead, she had to teach herself: at Bristol University where she focused more on cooking elaborate meals with like-minded friends than her art history course. Later, she worked as a freelance food stylist and recipe developer for Yotam Ottolenghi, before moving into restaurant kitchens. That began with a bang at the Palomar, London sibling of the cult Jerusalem restaurant Machneyuda. “I was terrified of going into a professional kitchen,” she says. “It was a hardcore kitchen.” But she held her own. That experience combined neatly with time at Berber & Q, the Good Egg and Barbary, all dovetailing with her own Ashkenazi Jewish background and developing interest in the food of the Middle East. It led, in the autumn of 2019, at the age of 31, to her first head chef role at the vegetarian Middle Eastern restaurant Bubala, in London’s Spitalfields; to an engrossing menu of hummus with burnt butter and pine nuts, fried aubergine with zhoug and date syrup or halloumi with black seed honey. You notice the huge flavours first and the fact it’s meat-free second, so that it feels like vegetarianism by stealth. It has won her a huge and loyal fanbase. The meat-free idea for Bubala came, she says, from her partner in the business, restaurateur Marc Summers, though neither of them is fully vegetarian. “He’d worked out there was a gap in the market. It was clear from the start it was going to be vegetarian.” The impact of that decision has been felt far beyond just the words on the menu. “As soon as we started, I realised the kitchen was so much calmer,” Graham says. “I’m very protective of the Bubala kitchen as a vegetarian space. You can’t even bring a smoked salmon bagel in there.” Asked to nominate a dish that defines her cooking, she chooses pumpkin with braised dandelion, smoked harissa and a pumpkin seed salsa. “It employs some classic techniques I’ve picked up over the years. Italian vegetables such as violino pumpkin and chicory catalogna contrast bitter, sweet and spicy in a way that I love.” This, she says, is the right food for the times. “I’m really proud of what we’ve done. I hope there are more vegetarian restaurants like this.” Other Bubalas may be among them. “I can’t say much about that, but we are looking to expand. And there will definitely be a cookbook at some point.” No, Helen Graham may not have a grandiose origin story, a place where she started, but she knows exactly where she’s going.Bubala, 65 Commercial Street, London E1; bubala.co.uk Head chef, Erst, Manchester Patrick Withington recognises the appeal of his story: that until he was 27 years old, he was a plumber; that he gave it all up and went into cooking professionally because he loved food more than he loved fitting radiators and calibrating boilers. But in truth, he says, he’d like the food he cooks at Erst, a wine bar and small plates restaurant in Manchester’s Ancoats, to be the thing that tells his story. “It’s about flavour,” he says. “It’s about the confidence to keep things simple.” And he does keep it simple, to dramatic effect: diners have swooned over his bubbled and blistered flatbreads, smeared with the glistening pulp of the very best of tomatoes, or with garlic butter and a quenelle of whipped lardo; over his beef tartare with tonnato sauce and his baked, then deep-fried potatoes, bursting lasciviously from their skins, or a pitch perfect bay leaf panna cotta. It’s a short menu, built on first principles. “There’s always a cured fish dish and a tartare and maybe a braised dish. And the flatbreads are always there.” Many of these dishes, he says, are ones he started cooking at supper clubs when he was working at Trove, the bakery in Levenshulme that he joined after deciding on a career change. Food has always been a part of his family’s culture. His dad was a big cook. At primary school, when required to give a talk, Withington decided to tell his classmates how to make a curry. The move into professional kitchens later in life seemed like a logical one to him. “When I got to Trove, I found like-minded people who were all in the same boat,” he says. “We’d all done other things first so we were all learning together. We had the freedom to do what we wanted to do.” That meant learning on the job. “For me it was about cooking my way through the Eagle cookbook or the Moro cookbook.” The interest in the Middle East and Spain provided by the latter, very much remains. And then there are the trips abroad. “I’d go to somewhere like Málaga and find my way to these unexpected and special places.” Erst, which opened in its stone and steel space in 2018, was designed to be one of those special places. “There was just nowhere in Manchester that was really informal,” Withington says. “Somewhere you could just go and have a plate or two of good food and leave.” At first it wasn’t easy. “We were really quiet. I’d go look at other restaurants doing more business and think, ‘We’re better than these places.’” But with time, customers found their way to his deft and direct cooking. “Too many places are constantly changing what they’re doing to try to please an imagined customer,” Withington says. Now 35, he’s determined to keep the business steady, while expanding his own culinary horizons and skills by looking to the classics. “Right now, I’m digging into the books of Marcella Hazan.” Those of us who have already had the pleasure of Withington’s cooking will be thrilled to see where that exploration takes him.Erst, 9 Murray Street, Ancoats, Manchester; erst-mcr.co.uk Head chef, Mangal 2, London When Sertaç Dirik was a kid, he was made to work in his father’s north London Turkish grill restaurant, Mangal 2, as a punishment. “If I’d got into trouble,” he says. “I’d be sentenced to work there at weekends for three months. A bit of meze. A bit of front of house.” Today, aged 25, he is that restaurant’s head chef. By melding his Turkish heritage with his culinary experiences both here and in Copenhagen, he has made it one of the most talked about restaurants in London. The extensive grill menu of kebabs and dips, familiar not just to the original Mangal 2 but the many other Turkish restaurants that surround it in Dalston, has gone. It has been replaced by something pared back and refined. Yes, there is hummus, but it has a deep, rustic funk and comes with the pepperiest of olive oils. Grilled sweetbreads come glazed with pomegranate molasses. Vine leaves are stuffed with rice, but they are spun through with brown crab meat and decorated with scribbles of a langoustine cream. Lamb is on the menu but it comes from deeply flavoured Cornish Cull Yaw, or old ewes. It is all rich, restless and compelling. “The whole experience has been about finding our own identity,” says Dirik, whose brother Ferhat runs front of house. “We grew up with our parents’ food but also amid London’s burgeoning restaurant scene.” His father Ali came to London in 1987 to open his restaurants, escaping impoverished beginnings in Turkey. “I wanted to make linkages between where they started and the food preserving techniques they learned, and my own experiences in London,” Dirik says. “It’s all about not wasting things.” Getting to this point has not been straightforward. Dirik dropped out of university at 20. His older brother told him to travel, a journey that took him to Copenhagen and work experience at Restaurant 108, sibling to the world-renowned Noma. “Most of my knowledge was then Turkish grill cooking,” he says. “I was probably quite difficult to work with.” In the spring of 2020 Ferhat asked him to come back to help with the restaurant that he had taken over from his father amid the uncertainty of the pandemic. “We realised this was our moment,” Dirik says. “Ferhat and I knew what we wanted to do in terms of feeling. For years we’d bought in the hummus and taramasalata. Now we were going to make everything. It was going to be more of a Turkish bistro. Our dad was a bit scared because the restaurant supports so many livelihoods.” There was also an early backlash from regular customers and from other Turkish restaurants on the strip. But with time comes acceptance. “We’re getting a lot of love now,” Dirik says. That is not the end of the story, however. “We’re not even at 20% of where we can be,” he says. “I don’t ever want us to stop evolving.” There is, he says, still a lot of work to be done.Mangal 2, 4 Stoke Newington Road, London N16; mangal2.com Co-head chefs, Land, Birmingham Adrian Luck and Tony Cridland are unlikely pioneers of meat-free cookery. Neither is vegan. Neither planned to become a culinary disrupter. But in Land, the small vegan restaurant they run in Birmingham, they have created a model for just how bold, striking and innovative plant-based cooking can be. Cridland, 31, had a standard classical training and worked his way around upmarket hotels before arriving at what was then the vegetarian Restaurant 1847. Luck, 35, was just looking for a job after a stint teaching English in Indonesia, when Cridland employed him. “To be honest I didn’t even know it was vegetarian when I came on board,” says Luck, who is self-taught. Not long after Luck joined, they took over the space inside Birmingham’s Great Western Arcade from its original owners. They renamed it Land, and decided to work as co-head chefs. Recently they crowdfunded a move to a smaller site within the same arcade, reducing the covers from 36 to a mere 22. “We just wanted to make it a better restaurant,” Luck says. “And so far, it’s worked. I actually think we’re doing better.” A meal at Land might start with crescents of roasted onion squash, on a bed of puy lentils, some of them deep fried to crisp, all of it bound in a mustard dressing. Or there could be Indian spiced carrots on a sweet-sour carrot and ginger puree, dressed with roasted seeds. It’s about sweet potato with a deep dark Mexican mole, or king oyster mushrooms with a white bean cassoulet. “I was pretty terrible at this sort of cooking at first,” Cridland says, honestly. Without the crutch of a lump of animal protein, he says, “you’ve got to be a lot more creative and thoughtful. It’s about putting depth and umami into a dish, about using fermentation and so on.” What it’s not about is using meat alternatives. “We don’t use any fake meats,” says Luck. “We want to showcase vegetables as best we can. We’ve developed a great repertoire of things we can use for texture. In truth we don’t even think of it as being vegan food any more. We’re just trying to make good food.” Today they offer a couple of tasting menus and divide up the dishes between themselves. Asked to describe a dish that exemplifies their food, Luck chooses wild mushrooms, slow cooked in dashi. “Then we add mushroom ketchup, parsley and tarragon and finish it with crisps of bean curd.” For Cridland it’s caramelised cauliflower with a spiced sauce and paprika oil. “Then we add puffed wild rice and dehydrated cauliflower leaves.” Both agree that they’d like national recognition for what they’re doing. “But that’s not the endgame,” Luck says. “It’s about the customer being happy.” Going by the healthy state of bookings, that goal has more than been achieved.Land, 30 Great Western Arcade, Colmore Row, Birmingham; land.restaurant",Lifestyle/Food,"An ex-plumber, a pie maker, a pair of pioneers: Jay Rayner picks his rising stars for 2022",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/16/an-ex-plumber-a-pie-maker-a-pair-of-pioneers-jay-rayner-picks-his-rising-stars-for-2022
1/16/2022,"A parliamentary inquiry will conclude that John Bercow, the former Speaker, bullied three House of Commons members of staff, he has revealed, denouncing it as as “kangaroo court”. The parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, has found Bercow guilty on 21 counts out of 35 brought by Robert Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, and private secretaries Kate Emms and Angus Sinclair, he told the Sunday Times.  The former Speaker, who stood down in 2019, said he is appealing against Stone’s ruling, with a final decision expected by the end of the month. Bercow said that after 18 months of being bound by confidentiality, he had decided to speak out because, despite participants being told they should not discuss the process, his accusers had not observed confidentiality and had criticised him publicly. If the verdict is upheld, he could be banned from parliament for life or face a censure motion. Bercow told the Sunday Times that the allegations against him were based largely on hearsay and that in many cases evidence was taken from people who were not present when the incidents under scrutiny took place. He also claimed that in seven cases, the investigators pronounced him innocent only for Stone to reverse the decision and find him guilty. The former Speaker said the burden of proof had effectively been reversed so he had to prove his innocence rather than his accusers having to prove his guilt. “I’m appealing on the basis that the investigations are materially flawed and that the decisions are unsound,” he said. “I resent massively my reputation being put through the wringer on the basis of a protracted, amateurish and unjust process.” Among the accusations, all of which he denies, that Bercow said had been made against him were: Throwing a mobile phone on two occasions nearly 12 years ago. Staring hatefully at an employee 11 years ago. ‘Ghosting’ a staffer on an plane. Swearing at an employee on an uncertain date in 2009. Making a racially and sexually discriminatory remark. Bercow admitted that he was a divisive – “Marmite” – figure and that he could be ratty and wind people up but insisted he had “hugely collegiate” relations with his team. Criticising the way the inquiry was conducted, he said: “To call it a kangaroo court is unfair to kangaroos.” Bercow said claims brought against him by David Leakey, a former parliamentary Black Rod, were rejected by the inquiry. Lord Lisvane criticised Bercow for making assertions “which are not true” and said the former Speaker had “casually broken” the confidentiality undertakings that bound everyone involved in the inquiry. He told the Sunday Times: “When I am released from the duty of confidentiality and all the documents in the inquiry are published, the record will be clear.” Bercow suggested there was animosity towards him because of his attempts to reform parliamentary procedure and modernise the operations of the Commons. Bercow was the first Speaker in more than two centuries to step down and not be nominated for the Lords by the government. Boris Johnson’s government resisted elevating Bercow, reportedly in part because of bullying claims but also because of his role in helping MPs to better scrutinise and amend the Brexit process. The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn nominated Bercow for a peerage but it was refused. Last year, Bercow announced he was switching his political allegiance to Labour, describing the Conservative party under Johnson as ““reactionary, populist, nationalistic and sometimes even xenophobic”.",News/Politics,"‘Kangaroo court’ has found me guilty of bullying, says John Bercow",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/john-bercow-speaker-commons-parliamentary-inquiry-kathryn-stone
1/16/2022,"Iadmit that I’m not well up in the affairs of giant corporations, but I do think that my nose for bullshit is fairly well attuned. And so it twitched when I read that Unilever’s chief executive, Alan Jope, said that “in the future, every Unilever brand [including Hellmann’s mayonnaise] will be a brand with purpose”, adding that he would sell those that “are not able to stand for something more important than just making your hair shiny, your skin soft, your clothes whiter or your food tastier”. Even as I was digesting this corporate swill, I was delighted to read the following crusty riposte from Terry Smith, who is the manager of the £29bn Fundsmith Equity fund, and therefore something of a big cheese in the City: “The Hellmann’s brand has existed since 1913 so we would guess that by now consumers have figured out its purpose (spoiler alert – salads and sandwiches).” I raise my cap to Smith and his own well-honed bullshit detector.
