4/18/2022,"It was a wet Wednesday in April, spent picking litter and spotting sewage in the River Wandle in Merton, south London, but the Lib Dems looked beside themselves with enthusiasm. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, was there to rally his activists with a speech highlighting Tory failures to clean up Britain’s waterways. He arrived in a sharp suit to deliver his party’s local election launch to waiting TV cameras, before gamely changing into wellies for a photo op in the water. “Soaring energy bills are overwhelming millions of families but this Conservative government doesn’t care or doesn’t get it. Instead of help, the Conservatives are raising unfair taxes again and again,” he says. “And Conservative MPs have voted time and time again to pour filthy sewage into our rivers like the Wandle.” It may seem an odd message to be giving out in Labour-held Merton – and in fact, a strange place for the party to kickstart its local election effort when it is unmistakably going after Tory rather than Labour voters. This council has never been held by the Lib Dems, unlike nearby Sutton or Kingston. In fact, it has swung from Labour towards the Tories, back to firmly Labour again. But this set of local elections is about gaining and building on “footholds” where the Lib Dems are strong in nearby areas, says one of the party’s senior electoral strategists. The party is fairly entrenched in about 27 councils in the UK, with disparate pockets of Lib Dem power in south-west London, Somerset and Cumbria. However, there are few places where the party is poised to take over any councils or even knock the governing parties into no overall control from second place, although they are hoping for a miracle in Labour-held Hull. The Lib Dem activists have the energy of insurgents, as they hope replace the Tories as the second biggest party on Merton council. But it is hard to know whether their optimism will translate into hard wins – and the party leadership is not sounding confident about any taking any new councils, despite the scandal-hit position of the Tories nationally. “It will be tough for us because we won a lot of councils four years ago – Kingston, Richmond and South Cambs. So we are fighting from a high base. There’s a few we can win, but it’s difficult,” Davey says, setting a low bar for success in gaining councillors on 5 May. The last council election in Merton saw 34 Labour councillors elected, 17 Tory, six Lib Dem and three independents. But there is a fairly strong geographical divide between the Labour-Merton and Tory-Wimbledon sides of the council area – and it is Wimbledon, the Conservative-voting seat of the Tory MP Stephen Hammond that the party has its sights on at a national contest. “We’re hoping to make lots and lots of gains in Merton,” says Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, who succeeded Vince Cable in the seat in 2019. One of the reasons the Lib Dems are feeling hopeful about Wimbledon is Paul Kohler, their parliamentary candidate who came within 628 votes of ousting Hammond in 2019. A university law lecturer, Kohler is well known in the area for being beaten up so badly in 2014 that he required facial reconstruction surgery. After his attackers were jailed for aggravated burglary, he visited one of them in jail in a restorative justice process. “People are angry about national politics, they are angry about Partygate and they can see the cost of living affecting them or others,” he says. “There’s lots of decent, soft, One Nation Tories who can’t abide the lies or hypocrisy of the Johnson Tory party. It’s not the party they recognise. It’s changed out of all proportion.” In terms of local issues, he says a big focus is “Mucky Merton” – with people annoyed by mess and rubbish collections. On the doorstep in Trinity ward, which has two Tory councillors along with one Lib Dem, Kohler is recognised by many of those he approaches along a street he says he will have canvassed three times before the campaign is out. His reception is generally positive, with his first resident, Louise, saying she will vote a mixture of two Lib Dem and one Green for an “unambiguous vote” in favour of environmental action, and she will not go for “complacent” Labour. Another resident, Andrew, says he will “possibly” support the Lib Dems but is weighing up them up with the Tories. But he gets a roasting from one woman, Jennifer, who lays into Davey’s stance on trans rights as “a disgrace” because she says that he cannot define what a woman is and that women are under threat of “having our rights taken away behind our backs”. The former Labour voter says she feels similarly about Keir Starmer, saying “Labour is finished” and that she does not like the way they have been running the council. Despite her harsh words for Davey, she says she will probably vote Lib Dem at the locals anyway. Among the Conservative activists in Wimbledon, one of them says the contest is harder fought than ever, describing his most recent outing on the Saturday doorstop as “a bit of a disastrous reception”. He says the view is “hardening” against Johnson among liberal metropolitan centre-right Tories, with little sympathy for his excuses over Partygate and concern about tax rises. The Lib Dems are feeling chipper after surprise byelection wins at Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire. They believe this test at the local elections in places like Wimbledon will show they have the potential to break new electoral ground in 2023-24.",News/Politics,‘It will be tough for us’: Lib Dems fight for ‘footholds’ in local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/18/liberal-democrats-fight-for-footholds-in-local-elections-2022

4/18/2022,"Simon Cundey’s family have been tailor-making men’s suits for seven generations, taking 37 measurements from every customer through the Great Depression and two world wars. The tailor’s arsenal of chalk, scissors and thread were put to work every weekday since the company was founded in 1806, until March 2020 when the government ordered almost everyone to work from home. “If there’s one thing you can’t do at home, it’s measure people for suits,” says Cundey, who has worked for his family firm, Henry Poole & Co, tailors on Savile Row in London since his early 20s. “The pandemic is, by far, the worst crisis the business has ever faced. It is far worse than the Great Depression or the wars ever were. “In wartime, the allied forces were here so we made uniforms for Americans and Canadians, and we could still see customers face-to-face,” he says, as we chat on leather sofas in front of a roaring log fire in the shop, surrounded by 48 framed warrants from the royal family and other world leaders. Post lockdown, Cundey and his team of cutters, undercutters, trouser-, jacket- and waistcoat-makers are back at work at 15 Savile Row – the street known the world over as the home of the finest bespoke menswear – and customers are coming back through the doors. But there are not as many as before the pandemic, and fewer than before the 2008 financial crisis. It’s a story repeated up and down “the row”, and at other tailors across the country, as well as high street retailers from Marks & Spencer to Reiss, and online companies from Mr Porter to Asos. Declarations of falling popularity don’t come much more authoritative than from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which last month removed suits from the basket of goods it uses to calculate the annual inflation rate. The government’s statistics agency said suits, which had been in the basket every year since 1947, were not bought often enough to make it into the basket of 733 representative goods and services selected to measure the UK’s cost of living. They have been replaced in the ONS basket with a “formal jacket or blazer”. Nick Paget, a senior menswear editor and “trends forecaster” at the consumer analytics firm WGSN, says “many men have simply fallen out of love with suits, if they ever did love them”. Paget, who has worked in menswear for more than 20 years, says suits were on the wane long before the pandemic, with dress-down Fridays slowly chipping away at office formality. “But 18 months of slouching around the house in joggers and a hoodie has definitely sped it up,” he says, adding that people just need suits less than they once did. “When a guy used to have to wear a suit to work, it wasn’t just one. He would have a number of suits on rotation and at the cleaners.” Men, Paget says, are now unafraid to tell their bosses what they want to wear to work. “I expect that as part of the deal to go back to work, people will be expected to wear formal suits less,” he says. “Personally, I hate wearing a collared shirt, and I know I’m not alone.” Figures from the market research firm Kantar Worldpanel back him up. It found that spending on men’s suits collapsed from £460m in 2017 to £157m in 2020, before recovering slightly to £279m last year. The suit is being replaced, Paget says, not with working from home outfits of joggers, jeans or hoodies but with “chore jackets”. Asked to explain, he says: “It’s in the name really.” They are jackets first designed for tradesmen to wear for handiwork, painting or plumbing. Originating in late 1800s France, where they were worn by farm workers and labourers, the jackets were dubbed “bleu de travail” or “worker’s blues” for their deep shade of indigo. “Workwear staples that are comfortable and practical have been elevated to office attire, particularly in the creative industries,” Paget says. “The fabrics and detailing have been improved on, but fundamentally they are clothes that an old-school plumber would have worn.” M&S, which has cut the number of stores selling suits to 110 out of its 245 larger locations, has credited the workwear trend with helping it return to profit on a half-year basis. Wes Taylor, M&S’s director of menswear, says the suit has been declining since at least 2019, when the market for them dropped 7%. As a result, the company is switching to focus on “separates” – suit trousers and jackets sold separately so they can be mixed and matched with less formal clothes. “The pandemic hit fast-forward on the trend for more casual dressing – especially for the office, where, for many, chinos and a shirt is the new uniform,” Taylor says. Gieves & Hawkes, the best-known Savile Row tailor, which dates back to 1771, could soon disappear altogether. Trinity Group, the Chinese owner, collapsed into liquidation earlier this year after failing to find a buyer for the tailor. Like most on the row, Gieves & Hawkes started out selling military uniforms to army officers. It operates out of No 1 Savile Row, the previous home of the Royal Geographical Society and is by far the biggest shop on the street. Under Chinese ownership, the company has expanded to 58 shops in 25 cities, which experts say may be the reason it has been hard to sell. “The ubiquity has diminished the exclusivity somewhat,” Paget says. Gieves & Hawkes is not the only struggling tailor. Hardy Amies, the firm founded by Sir Edwin Hardy Amies in 1946 and which specialised in suits for British Olympians, collapsed in 2019. Thomas Pink, the City shirtmaker, collapsed in 2020 before it was bought from the previous owner, the luxury conglomerate LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) by the former JD Sports executive Nick Preston. Andy Saxton, strategic insight director for fashion at Kantar, doesn’t expect the market for office suits to recover but reckons people are more willing than ever to spend money on suits for weddings and parties. “Casualisation has been growing for quite some years now,” he says– while wearing a navy jumper with dark jeans. “The suits market is down 40% in five years, I don’t think that is ever coming back to that level. But I do feel there are huge opportunities for dressing-up for celebrations – I feel like everyone is going to go very big on weddings.” Saxton says people are demanding clothes “work harder” for them. “They don’t want to spend money buying something just for the office,” he says. “They want their clothes to have flexibility and a multipurpose nature: ‘Yes, I can wear it to work, but I could also wear it out on a night out with my mates.’ It’s now all about blurring the boundaries between work and life.” On Black Friday in the UK, suits were the most heavily discounted items, with 54% of all tailoring marked down, according to WGSN Instock data. At Henry Poole, Cundey thinks society is about to go through a mass “smartening up period” that will filter down across all walks of life as we return to life as it was pre-pandemic. “It’s like the great beast waking from a slumber,” he says. “As people go back to work and engage socially again, they will remember why they need to be smart. “Soon there will be Ascot and Wimbledon, of course,” he says. “But for everyone, there’s always a point where you have to dress to a certain degree. “When your wife or partner dresses up and you come out in a hoodie and a pair of jogging pants, you have to ask yourself, would they be happy with you? The answer is no, of course.” Cundey reckons the reason many young men don’t like suits is because they have been wearing the wrong size. “Lots of people say they hate wearing suits, but that’s probably because they were forced to wear an ill-fitting one at school,” he says. “I’d hate wearing them, too, if they didn’t fit. The No 1 rule is you shouldn’t feel a suit. It should be natural, there should be no tightness and no looseness.” Wearing the wrong suit, Cundey says, is worse than not wearing one at all. “Remember when [Mark] Zuckerberg of Facebook got hauled up before Congress?” Cundey says. “He looked like a naughty schoolboy because his suit was three sizes too small.” The New York Times dubbed it the “I’m sorry suit”. Cundey, who wears a suit every day, has a view on just about every famous man and his wardrobe. Critiquing Boris Johnson, he says, is too easy but he gives it a go anyway. “Obviously, there could be a better look for Johnson – his suits are far too big. But really, it comes down to mentality and how you carry yourself. Some people get it, some people don’t.” Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, on the other hand, is praised for always looking “slim and trim” but “perhaps his suits are a little on the small side”. Cundey’s sons – Henry (who is nicknamed Henry VIII, as he is the eighth generation since the original Henry Poole) and Jamie – are expected to carry on the family tailoring tradition, but even they don’t wear suits every day, Cundey finally concedes. “They are smart casual,” he says, “but they don’t let me down.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,The end of the suit: has Covid finished off the menswear staple?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/18/the-end-of-the-suit-has-covid-finished-off-the-menswear-staple
4/18/2022,"Kansas men’s basketball coach Bill Self employed a variety of strategies while securing the Jayhawks’ fourth national title earlier this month. Suffice to say, how many Black players he selected was not a talking point. But six decades ago the composition of the team was a significant call for Loyola’s George Ireland. His decision to start four Black players not only proved the difference in the Ramblers’ 1963 NCAA title run; it became a moment similar to Jackie Robinson signing with the Dodgers 75 years ago – one of those decisions that led to a sport becoming more inclusive, and also helped fuel the civil rights movement across the US. And yet for as watershed an event as the Ramblers’ ’63 title was, it has long tarried in the shadow of a Texas Western team that won the 1966 NCAA title with five Black starters – a David and Goliath matchup memorialized in the Jerry Bruckheimer classic Glory Road. Even recent members of the Ramblers basketball team didn’t know much more than the basics of the ’63 team’s quest – even as the story came roaring back to the fore during the Ramblers’ recent storybook run to the 2018 Final Four. “And we have relationships with those guys,” says Lucas Williamson, a co-captain on the 2021-22 Ramblers team. “Especially pre-Covid, they were always around – at practices, at games. We know them. But we just never really talked about the racial issues they had actually gone through.” The CBS/Paramount+ documentary, The Loyola Project, reckons with the ’63 team’s hidden history. It mixes archival footage, graphic novel-style reconstructions and interviews with members of the ’63 team (also: Sister Jean appears!) For the better part of an hour, the doc retraces the Ramblers’ journey to college basketball’s mountaintop – a pathway made especially fraught by the unwritten rule against playing more than two Black players at a time. Three was really pushing it. Ireland’s decision to play four would seem to make him out to be a real White Shadow, a true ally in the struggle, while pioneering the high-pressure style that has become the standard across basketball. But the truth, director Patrick Creadon found, was far more complex. In hindsight Ireland’s choice to recruit Black players from the inner city appears less motivated by altruism than the desperation of being a coach on the hot seat. Despite the physical toll his fast-paced playing style exacted, Ireland ran the Ramblers into the ground, his habit of rarely substituting starters giving rise to the nickname ‘The Iron Five’. Even more disturbing was Ireland’s apathy for the well-being of his Black players off the court. They were used as props at Loyola’s all-white school dances, were boarded on the Black side of segregated New Orleans for one big road game and were compelled to suffer racially abusive crowds. Overall, Ireland barely lifted a finger to defend or protect the Black Ramblers against the prevailing ugliness of the day. And in the rare instances Ireland did interfere, he was heavy handed. After Jerry Harkness, the team’s best player in the NCAA final, flagged a pair of threatening letters, Ireland began intercepting all the hate mail addressed to the Ramblers’ Black players – a noble act, notionally. But when the threats got too real, Ireland commandeered a security detail for his daughters, not his Black players. He also never returned any of that mail to the players, leading some to think that Ireland had made up the threat in a twisted attempt to motivate his team. But the letters do indeed exist. Ireland’s daughter, Judy, holds them under lock and key. “She had three envelopes full,” Creadon says. “I saw probably 125 letters, but I have reason to believe there were probably 400 or 500, which included everything from flat out death threats to stuff signed KKK to the n-word being thrown around constantly. It was awful. “But what happened next was weird. I told the players I had seen the mail, and they said, ‘We want it. It’s our mail. We’re not kids anymore. We want to see it ourselves.’” That started a year of back-and-forth conversations between production and the Ireland family to release the mail, and ended with the family holding firm, even when Harkness died last year during the making of The Loyola Project. “It was always about, ‘Well, with all this George Floyd stuff going on and these crazy BLMers, if we release this mail now, who knows what could happen?’ And I just remember thinking, who are you defending here?” Creadon says. Sadly, relatively little of this drama plays out on camera. But that’s not necessarily to the detriment of The Loyola Project. The doc does a good job to show the actual allies the Ramblers had on their side – not least the all-white Mississippi State basketball team, who flouted their governor’s ban against playing integrated opponents and went on to lose to Loyola in the second round of the NCAA Tournament (aka The Game of Change). And Creadon smartly casts aside his aesthetic pride and includes snippets of a Zoom call between members of the ’63 squad and the recent team, which was revelatory to both sides. “It was the smaller things that really shocked us,” says Williamson, who majored in journalism. “Like Ireland [displaying] the national championship trophy at a barbershop that they couldn’t get into. Or us being absolutely celebrated on campus for making the Final Four and being treated like absolute royalty – but them feeling like they’re invisible, even after they won. Jerry couldn’t even get an apartment in Rogers Park.” But Creadon and his team’s real masterstroke was turning their film over to Williamson to provide narration and contribute some writing. “We realised the more Lucas weighed in on the story, the more valuable his perspective is,” Creadon says. “He’s basically walking in the same shoes as Jerry Harkness.” “I was hesitant at first,” Williamson says of joining The Loyola Project. “I knew the story – not as well as I do now, but I knew how serious it was. It meant a lot to me, and I didn’t want to be the one to mess it up.” What Williamson wound up doing was bringing a righteous degree of skepticism to a fraught chapter of history that could have easily been spun into yet another whitewashed civil rights fairytale. As much as it smarts that it took this long for the story of the ’63 Ramblers’ Jackie Robinson moment to be told in full, The Loyola Project at least can say it told it the right way – with insight and empathy in equal depth.

4/18/2022,"Wolves accompanyme, a dream I’d like to have,lope across a steppe, howl an ode to the half-moon,break bread with al-Farazdaq, hunt mice if we must.Overarching, the night skyblankets the city we’re immured in, or opensit up to ghazals of rain. MH, 19 April 2020 A rain of ghazals,petrichor from verse by long-lost poets, crumble many sabre-toothed daymares,if just for a rainbow while. Ghalib, Faiz, Firaq,Sahir (always Sahir), thenthe doyen, Khusrau: sufi, secular or plainkafir; then ghazal, nazm, and sher, the first to strikemy early, unlearned ears;demand rebellion yet earn adoration froma resolute nastic heart. KN, 20 April 2020 This week’s paired poems are from A Different Distance: A Renga by the American poet Marilyn Hacker and the French-Indian poet, dance producer and curator Karthika Naïr. Renga (meaning “linked verse”) is Japanese syllabic writing in extended and collaborative form. Its composition was traditionally shared by a group of poets at a friendly and bibulous get-together, who took turns to improvise response-poems until they had completed the verse-chain. Living in Paris during the Covid-19 lockdown, Hacker and Naïr were able to meet in person only once, and built their two-poet renga by email. Like postcards or letters sharpened by formal constraints and the desirability of swift response, the poems in A Different Distance made me think of Gerald Manley Hopkins’s sorrowful lines comparing his cries to “dead letters sent / to dearest him that lives alas! away”. These “letters” are the opposite of course – briskly alive, and listening responsively to one another. They contain the energy of their moment, and the pleasure of spontaneous verbal interaction, a reminder that, beyond the confines of renga, poems are often sparked off by other poems. The 114-page series begins in March 2020 and closes in March 2021. Hacker’s “Wolves accompany / me” is launched by the previous poem from Naïr, which begins “Who knows anything” and concludes by juxtaposing the image of “sun-drenched” Parisian quais with herself, brooding “indoors with / Coke as cure and company”. Naïr begins with a flourish of scepticism about the abilities of “Prefects, priests, pressmen, / physicians” to know anything for certain. Hacker’s response is the “dream I’d like to have”, in which she finds her own company of wolves, and shares their freedom of the steppe. There’s an almost out-of-body experience, a fluid combination of wolf and human, hunting mice “‘if we must” and time-travelling back “to break bread with Al-Farazdaq”, the Arab poet who died in 790. (Al-Farazdaq is also Ghalib, the poet named first in the group listed by Naïr). Although the dreamer in Hacker’s adventure returns to nocturnal Paris and imprisonment, the waking dream lingers in the sparkling, arrowing image of “ghazals of rain”. Liberation by poetry is the theme Naïr takes up. Her response-poem is in a very different mood from her earlier piece. Translating Hacker’s “ghazals of rain” to “a rain of ghazals”, Naïr swiftly invokes refreshment with “petrichor” (the scent of recent rainfall). Naïr says that “Wolves accompany / me” had galvanised her when she first read it. It arrived just as she’d begun regular sessions of chemotherapy, which she describes as “a gruelling weekly rhythm”. That difficult rhythm becomes in the poem the liberating rhythms of the poets she first revered: the names themselves make insistent rhythms, and form a synecdoche for their work. The poets listed are Faiz Ahmad Faiz, a 20th-century Marxist poet writing in Urdu; Firaq Gorakhpuri (1896-1982) the Indian poet and critic; Khusrau, 12th-century Sufi poet; and poet and film-song lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi. Naïr also names some poetic structures: “ghazal, nazm, and // sher”. The paradox for the writer is that she’s an atheist (nastic): the Sufi writers therefore “demand rebellion // yet earn adoration”. It’s so often that way with the poets of the past! Both poems open passageways through images and sounds to an ancient poetic garden, mysteriously in bud. The syllabic “lockdown” of the tanka form is always present in the renga, but there’s a sense of larger, rougher life cutting through the walls. The poems lean inwards only to lead outwards and towards each other. In an interesting essay Renga: the Literary Embodiment of Impermanence and Nonself David Landis Barnhill argues that the form is essentially Buddhist. The renga published by Hacker and Naïr, conversely, testifies to permanence (the capture of experience) and enhanced – if sometimes lonely and suffering – selfhood. Distinctly personal moments and moods are caught by each poet “just for a rainbow while” as Naïr memorably puts it. Even though intertextuality is highlighted, their voices are enjoyably distinct. If you’re thinking of embarking on a renga, here’s a useful guide to the craft. For deeper inspiration, listen to the poets themselves reading from their newly launched collection.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: from a renga by Marilyn Hacker and Karthika Naïr,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/apr/18/poem-of-the-week-from-a-renga-by-marilyn-hacker-and-karthika-nair
4/18/2022,"Priti Patel has defended plans to send unauthorised asylum seekers on a one-way ticket to Rwanda, saying critics of the scheme have failed to offer any alternative solution to the migration crisis. The proposal, announced last week, has been widely condemned as inhumane, illegal, unworkable and prohibitively expensive. Critics have included Tory MPs and peers, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) and the archbishop of Canterbury, who said, in his Easter Sunday sermon, that the scheme “does not stand the judgment of God”. Writing in the Times in a joint article with the Rwandan foreign minister, Vincent Biruta, Patel, the home secretary, hit back at critics. She said the proposal was the act of a “humanitarian nation”, describing the partnership as “groundbreaking” and one that would set “a new international standard”. She said: “We are taking bold and innovative steps and it’s surprising that those institutions that criticise the plans, fail to offer their own solutions.” The home secretary said the plans would help put an end to the “deadly trade” of people trafficking and also the “deeply unfair” current situation which “advantages those with the means to pay people traffickers over vulnerable people who cannot”. She said: “We can provide legal, safe, orderly and controlled ways for people to better their lives, flee oppression, persecution or conflict and enjoy new opportunities.” However, a letter to the prime minister by 150 British organisations supporting refugees, including the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Rainbow Migration and Hope not Hate, has claimed the plan would “cause immense suffering” and “result in more, not fewer, dangerous journeys – leaving more people at risk of being trafficked”. The government has also been criticised for not creating new safe and legal routes to the UK for asylum seekers, having previously suggested that such new routes would ensure that people would no longer need to risk their lives trying to reach the UK. Patel and Biruta also defended Rwanda against critics who point out its poor human rights record, with groups having logged torture of detainees. They wrote that the scheme would “support the humane and respectful treatment of refugees, provide human capital opportunities for migrants and the host community and offer safe and legal pathways for those fleeing persecution and insecurity”. The energy minister, Greg Hands, echoed Patel’s defence. Asked on Sky News if the archbishop of Canterbury was wrong to call the plan “ungodly”, he said: “I think what others, the critics of this plan, need to do is to show what their solution would be.” He also rejected suggestions that the scheme was unworkable, insisting it would act as a “significant deterrent” to people attempting to cross the Channel in small boats. “We think that it will work and we are confident that it will work, he told Times Radio. “We need to be sending that message now – that crossing the Channel illegally isn’t necessarily going to lead to the person being located in the UK. “So, the relocation to Rwanda is there – it will act as a significant deterrent, we think, to people making that journey, and [it] will ultimately be at the cost of the people smugglers who … we want to put out of business.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel: Rwanda plan critics ‘fail to offer their own solutions’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/18/priti-patel-rwanda-plan-critics-fail-to-offer-their-own-solutions
4/18/2022,"Australian voters are unlikely to be told the full cost of scrapping the French submarine deal before the election, with Peter Dutton signalling the negotiations will not be wrapped up until after July. The defence minister said on Monday the talks with France’s Naval Group would “take some time” and the information would not be released publicly until after those figures were settled. With Australia’s election campaign in full swing, caretaker conventions require the government to avoid entering major contracts or undertakings except after consulting the opposition. “It’ll be after the election – it will take some time,” Dutton told reporters in Adelaide. “What happens in a commercial negotiation is that if the other side knows that you have got a hard deadline, then they will hold you over a barrel.” He backed away from previous suggestions it could be before the end of this financial year, saying that would “likely not” be achieved. Tony Dalton, a deputy secretary of the Department of Defence, had previously told a Senate estimates hearing he was “working towards” finalising the settlement with Naval Group this financial year. Dalton had also expected a related settlement with Lockheed Martin Australia – the US-linked company that had been contracted to supply the combat system – by the end of April. The Labor party supports the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK, including plans for Australia to build nuclear-propelled submarines. But the cost of the U-turn has become a matter of significant political contention in the run-up to the 21 May election. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has brushed off questions about funding for Labor’s own spending commitments by calling the Morrison government “the most wasteful government in the history of our federation”. “If you want to talk about mismanagement of money … let’s talk about $5.5bn wasted on submarines that will never be built,” Chalmers said on Saturday. That figure is based on testimony from officials that the settlement could be met from within the existing budget for the abandoned Attack class submarine program. Budget papers indicate $5.5bn had already been approved in funding for the project before it was dumped. About $2.5bn of this sum had already been spent as of January. The government has not amended the budget figures pending the negotiations. When asked by the Labor senator Penny Wong on 1 April whether “taxpayers would be up for $5.5bn on submarines that don’t exist”, Dalton replied: “The final negotiated settlement will be within that price.” But Dutton on Monday denied $5.5bn would be needed. He visited the Osborne shipyard in South Australia to announce a $381m project to replace the periscopes in Australia’s six existing Collins class conventional submarines with a “cutting edge optronics system”. The Coalition said a digital camera would be installed on an extendable mast-raising system outside each submarine’s pressure hull, capturing imagery “at a much faster rate”. The system would transmit this imagery into the submarine digitally via a water-tight cable, “making our submarines more agile and effective while keeping our people safer at sea”. HMAS Rankin is slated to be the first submarine to undergo this upgrade at Osborne from 2024. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dutton said the upgrade would help ensure the Collins class submarines remained “a potent and agile deterrent until replaced by nuclear-propelled submarines”. Labor has raised concerns about the so-called “capability gap” between now and when the first of the new nuclear-propelled submarines are ready, probably in the late 2030s. The government has committed to major work to extend the life of the Collins class submarines. Labor says, if elected, it would take advice on what can be done to bridge the gap, including considering fitting Tomahawk missiles to the existing submarines. Morrison has previously defended the costs of pivoting to Aukus, saying his Plan B “was better than Plan A”.",News/Australia news,"Australians unlikely to know cost of scrapped submarines until after election, Peter Dutton says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/18/australians-unlikely-to-know-cost-of-scrapped-submarines-until-after-election-peter-dutton-says
