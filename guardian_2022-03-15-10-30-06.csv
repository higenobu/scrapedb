3/15/2022,"Ionce met a man on the internet who had served in the Special Operations Command. Actually, that’s a lie – one of a barrage that were only revealed when I finally met someone who knew him. As much as you could know him. So it was a bit of a jolt watching Fakes – Monday night’s episode of Australian Story about serial fantasists and con artists in the online dating world – when one of the women interviewed by journalist Stephanie Wood mentioned: “He said he’d been in the SAS and was awarded a Purple Heart. He said he’d killed people in battle.” They weren’t the same man, but the story was eerie. When serial liars start to overload their targets with shaky autobiographical details, they must eventually serve up some gripping “explanation” of why something is not quite right about them. Such as the cases in this episode: “He told me he was an orphan.” “He told me he had brain cancer.” Wood herself spent 14 months in a relationship with someone whose persona was all lies. Her Good Weekend cover story in 2017 about “Joe” expanded into a book, Fake, in 2019. Two years later she was still getting messages from women who’d been in the same boat (a yacht, obviously). She interviewed some for Australian Story, as well as clinical psychologist Elisabeth Shaw, who explains the personality disorders underpinning such behaviour, chief of which is narcissistic personality disorder. Conned into love: How smart women are abused by romantic frauds @StephanieAWood1Fakes | Monday 8pm on #AustralianStory @ABCTV @oliviarousset pic.twitter.com/jbGCUjgTiv Following the success of Catfish, the eight-season MTV show about people creating fake online personas, tales of internet dating cons have crossed over with the cultural appetite for true-crime drama. Most recently, there’s The Tinder Swindler, which hit the top 10 on Netflix in 92 countries – but also many podcasts, including Who the Hell is Hamish?; Conning the Con; Dirty John (which also became a TV series); Cold and Do You Know Mordechai? This fascination explains why words such as “narcissist” and “gaslighting” have replaced the usual sympathetic murmurings from friends that “they’re just not that into you” (only one in 200 people is thought to be a diagnosable narcissist so we can’t all have dated one), but accounts such as those in Australian Story are terrifying in the sheer scale of their deception. Many of the women hadn’t been duped out of money. Often, the men were already in other relationships, but always they sought to appear to be a dazzling success story. “Being adored was his oxygen,” says one woman. I’m reminded of when the man I dated, who we’ll call Kane, ventured, “I get the feeling I’m your hero.” In Kane’s anecdotes he always cast himself as the strapping, accidental hero, surviving on his quick wit, the Bear Grylls of suburbia. In the first few weeks we dated, he fixed things, proposed adventures, leapt out to open my car door and researched my interests at the library after work (he said). Yet I had this unnerving feeling, like driving with a car in my blind spot. A few months into what had morphed into a tenuous friendship, Kane made an uncharacteristic error, introducing me to a girl he’d reconnected with from his school days. Claire and I hit it off and met up of our own accord. When we compared notes, his origin story completely fell apart. Suddenly, believing his story about the tour of duty in Iraq and brush with legionnaire’s disease seemed foolish. Race-car smashes, guns to the head, 10-1 barroom brawls, losing his virginity to a copper’s wife … all a bit dubious. If you’re chortling that someone would take at face value such tall tales, well, I can only offer that I thought lying was a device for saving your skin, not for fashioning your own creation myth – though at one point, during my debrief with Claire, I had a vivid memory of blurting out an outright fib in the playground once. I remembered how, for a brief moment, it won me admiration. I remembered the feeling of power that gave me. And how easy it was. But there are certain traits that do make us vulnerable to deception. Personally, I’d quit drinking and had convinced myself no one would date someone sober. Claire mentioned that Kane seemed to be targeting many of her single-parent friends to charm them on Facebook. It’s suggested in Australian Story that people who have come out of bruising relationships are also at risk; in Guardian UK’s Today in Focus podcast, it was suggested that the pandemic – and its associated loneliness – have made us even more vulnerable. While dating apps usually offer no more protection than the ability to report someone, there is – as Wood says – a playbook, and the more people who know what to look out for, the better. Perhaps they have a scant internet footprint. They disappear for periods. They don’t introduce you to family or old friends. Claire described Kane’s life as a Venn diagram where no circle must overlap. When I confronted Kane, he abruptly broke off contact. The next day, my ute – which as a mechanic (following his retirement from Special Ops) he had helped me pick out – was broken into. Over the next year, it was broken into a further four times. I’ll never know if was him, and I remember overhearing the friend of a friend scoff at a party about the, “Oh, the old ‘I’m being stalked’ story.” How to explain to people, 12 years ago, what we are only now learning: it wasn’t that he was obsessed with me, it was that he wanted to outsmart me. To outsmart everyone.

3/15/2022,"When Kazuya Kobayashi decided to leave Tokyo to pursue his dream of running his own ramen restaurant, Sano was an obvious choice. As well as being the spiritual home of Japanese cricket, the town in Tochigi prefecture is famed for its ramen shops, many of which are struggling to find successors. “The coronavirus came along, and my wife is medically vulnerable, so it seemed like the right time to move,” said Kobayashi, who hopes to open his own restaurant next year. The 40-year-old is not alone in wanting to bid sayōnara to the world’s most populous city, a megalopolis of 13.9 million people with a GDP bigger than that of the Netherlands. The capital’s population fell in 2021 for the first time in more than a quarter of a century, with a net loss of 48,592 from a year earlier, according to a recent metropolitan government estimate. The number of people seeking advice on starting a new life beyond Tokyo’s concrete sprawl rose dramatically last year – a trend experts say has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic and the advent of teleworking. A government project launched in 2015 to revitalise Japan’s regions is bearing fruit, according to Hiroshi Takahashi, chairman of the Hometown Return Support Centre, a nonprofit that helps people relocate from the Tokyo region to rural areas. The centre received almost 50,000 consultations last year from people hoping to move from greater Tokyo, more than 70% of them from people younger than 50. The most popular choice of new home was Shizuoka – a prefecture on the Pacific coast that can be reached by bullet train in about an hour – but second place went to Fukuoka prefecture, 550 miles south-west of the capital. Although Japanese companies have given remote working a cautious welcome, the pandemic proved it was possible for people to limit their time in the office and still stay productive. But according to Takahashi, would-be emigrants from big cities cite quality of life, childcare services and the cost of living more frequently than teleworking in explaining their desire to start a new life in the regions. Changes in Japan’s economy had encouraged more people to leave the capital, he said. “During the postwar years, people dreamed of living in Tokyo,” he said. “Japan achieved its economic transformation, but in the 30 years since the bubble burst, life is more uncertain and Tokyo has lost some of its attraction. Now more people dream of leaving.” Takahashi believes the “goodbye Tokyo” trend will continue long after the pandemic has ended. “In the past, work was all that mattered, but now families are thinking about their living environment, too. People’s values have changed.” That view is supported by a recent cabinet office survey, which found that almost half of people in their 20s living in central Tokyo said they were interested in moving out. Sano has capitalised on its association with Japan’s favourite comfort food to attract prospective chefs like Kobayashi. Two years ago, it launched a “ramen migration project” that provides training in everything from making noodles to management and accountancy. The local government also offers financial assistance and helps match newly qualified chefs with ramen shops. “I worked in restaurant kitchens in Tokyo and have always wanted to run my own place, so when I saw the ramen project on the TV I decided to apply,” said Kobayashi, 40, whose wife is expecting their first child. “I spent 15 years in Tokyo and liked it there, but the cost of living is much lower here and people come from all over to eat Sano ramen, so it makes sense financially.” Sano began offering incentives to new residents in an attempt to arrest depopulation, according to Mitsuru Ozeki, an official in the town’s emigration division. “We wanted to find a way to set Sano apart from other places and its connection with ramen was the obvious way to do that,” Ozeki said. “We offer incentives to young people to buy homes here, and there are other financial benefits. The rents are low, the air is clean and the food is delicious.” Last April, Gakuto Nishimura, a born-and-bred Tokyoite, quit his job in mobile phone sales and left for the mountainous idyll of Chichibu, a town of 60,000 people a two-hour drive from Tokyo. “I’d been thinking about changing jobs, and the pandemic pushed me into making a decision,” said Nishimura, whose interest in Chichibu had been piqued by its appearances in anime films. Chichibu officials say they are receiving a growing number of inquiries from young people. To encourage them to take the plunge, the town provides cash to renovate unoccupied homes or to buy a car, and the chance to live in a local home for up to a week to get a feel for life there. Nishimura, 24, now organises events targeting other Tokyoites who are thinking of following suit. “I tell them about the nature here, and the low rents, but also how much easier it is for young people to move around these days, as many of them are in jobs they can do remotely,” said Nishimura, whose apartment is significantly larger, and cheaper, than his old place in Tokyo. “I have no regrets about leaving Tokyo and, even though it’s my home town, I have no intention of going back.”",News/World news,Why are Tokyo residents saying sayōnara to Japan’s capital?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/tokyo-population-fell-japan-capital
3/15/2022,"China has already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support during its war on Ukraine and is contemplating sending military supplies such as armed drones, US officials fear. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, laid out the US case against Russia’s invasion in an “intense” seven-hour meeting in Rome with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, pointing out that Moscow had feigned interest in diplomacy while preparing for invasion, and also that the Russian military was clearly showing signs of frailty. The US delegation in Rome had not expected the Chinese diplomats to negotiate, seeing them as message deliverers to Beijing. “It was an intense seven-hour session, reflecting the gravity of the moment, as well as our commitment to maintaining open lines of communication,” a senior administration official said. “This meeting was not about negotiating specific issues or outcomes, but about a candid, direct exchange of views.” Asked if it had been successful, the official replied: “I suppose it depends on how you define success, but we believe that it is important to keep open lines of communication between the United States and China, especially on areas where we disagree.” However, the Americans walked away from the Rome meeting pessimistic that the Chinese government would change its minds about backing Moscow. “The key here is first to get China to recalculate and re-evaluate their position. We see no sign of that re-evaluation,” said another US official familiar with the discussions. “They’ve already decided that they’re going to provide economic and financial support, and they underscored that today. The question really is whether they will go further.” Top of the Russian military shopping list in China are armed drones and various forms of ammunition, but any military transfers would not be straightforward. “Both sides understand that they don’t share common systems, and so that makes it problematic,” the official said. CNN reported that the Russian military is also asking for ration packs, underlining its severe logistical problems in a more prolonged and tougher conflict than it anticipated. Russia needs economic and financial aid most urgently, in the face of devastating sanctions imposed by the US and its allies since the 24 February invasion. The country is danger of default on its debt payments, with two interest payments due on Wednesday, though it will have a 30-day grace period. Moscow is unable to access nearly all of its $640bn in gold and foreign exchange reserves, but still holds part of those reserves in yuan, so Beijing will be able to step in to provide immediate assistance. There is pessimism in Washington about the possibility of steering China away from throwing in its lot with Russia, largely because it sees the partnership as being driven from the top. “It really is a project of Xi Jinping. He is totally, fundamentally behind this closer partnership with Russia,” the US official said. There is more scepticism lower down the ranks, but Xi and Putin have bonded over their shared view of the US as being heavy- and high-handed, and determined to end the period of US global dominance. If China does back Russia in its showdown with the west, the Biden administration will shift its focus to persuading allies, in Europe particularly, to rethink their relationships with Beijing. Sullivan is due in Paris on Tuesday for discussions with the French government. “The United States believes that the key here is a careful process of dialogue and discussion with Europe about what China is revealing about its global policies and priorities,” the US official said. “Our goal basically is to carefully engage China, letting the Europeans know [what we are doing] all along, but if it becomes clear that [China] is moving in another direction, so be it.”",News/World news,"China has already decided to send economic aid to Russia in Ukraine conflict, US officials fear",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/china-has-already-decided-to-send-economic-aid-to-russia-in-ukraine-conflict-us-officials-fear
3/15/2022,"A new $80,000 art prize for Australian women has been awarded to a former refugee whose work – exploding in colour – is a response to colonial oppression. Atong Atem’s vivid photographic portraits have earned her the inaugural La Prairie art award, which will see the Art Gallery of New South Wales spend $50,000 acquiring the artist’s work and fund a $30,000 international residency in Zurich in June, for Atem to attend the Art Basel international art fair. Atem is a Melbourne-based South Sudanese artist who arrived in Australia as a six-year-old refugee. She spent her formative years studying art history and coming to terms with a European art hegemony that depicted people of colour in a damaging and unrealistic form. Atem’s joyous, subversive self-portraits employ riotous cosmetic and costume devices to deliver a visually pleasurable – and intellectually uncomfortable – punch. Atem is partly inspired by photographer Hoda Afshar, whose mesmerising 2018 portrait of Iranian Kurdish refugee Behrouz Boochani turned him into a potent symbol of the Australian government’s asylum seeker policy. “To be overtly political but also totally accessible, and also [produce something] beautiful – that is an underrated skill,” Atem says. Arguably Atem’s most recognisable work to date – Saba and Gabby, commissioned for the Immigration Museum in Melbourne in 2020 – appears to make an ironic nod to uber-kitsch artist of the 1950s and 1960s Vladimir Tretchikoff, whose Chinese Girl portrait adorned the living room walls of millions of white middle-class homes in the mid-20th century, exploiting the exoticism of “oriental” and African sensuality. Atem’s own introduction to how the white world viewed her “individual blackness” was unearthed through the discovery of black and white ethnographic photographs taken by colonial tourists and anthropologists. As an art student at the University of Sydney and later RMIT, she responded to the unfamiliar images by applying watercolours to the originals. “I was still just wanting to find an art history that I could comfortably fit into, and that I could resonate with, even though there were a lot of western artists whose works really inspired me,” she says. “But the first images that I came across were quite dehumanising depictions.” It was then that Atem understood that the camera was a colonial weapon that she could turn on her adversary. “That’s when it all kicked off for me,” she says. By turning the lens back on herself and her community – which has long been been the subject of rightwing racism and political hysteria – Atem claimed her position as a black female artist in Australia. “Yes, it’s political, gendered and racial,” she says. “But what isn’t?” Atem’s work has been exhibited at the Messum’s gallery in London, Red Hook Labs in New York, Vogue Fashion Fair in Milan and Unseen Amsterdam art fair.",Arts/Culture,"La Prairie art award: photographer Atong Atem wins inaugural $80,000 prize",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/15/la-prarie-art-award-photographer-atong-atem-wins-inaugural-80000-prize
