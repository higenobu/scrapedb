1/25/2022,"Free online anti-racism training is to be made available for the first time for the 300,000 governors and trustees who control recruitment of senior staff across maintained schools, academies and multi-academy trusts in England. The move comes amid concerns about a stark lack of racial diversity among headteachers. Only 7.3% of headteachers in state-funded schools in England come from minority ethnic backgrounds, despite that group making up 21.5% of the working age population.  The National Governance Association (NGA) has entered into partnership with the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) to provide the training. It is the first time the bodies have launched a joint enterprise or provided free training. “Our action shows how seriously concerned we are by the lack of racial diversity among school leaders,” said Emma Knight, the chief executive of the NGA. “We need to get governors and leaders to think about what they personally might be doing to create these widespread inequalities, and how they each have to change.” The move comes as headteachers of colour talk to the Guardian with unprecedented candour about their experience of widespread and often devastating racial discrimination throughout their careers. The ASCL and the NGA made the decision to fund the free training after giving up hope that the government would provide training. Knight said she hoped it would “send a very clear message” to governors about the importance of accessing guidance, despite the government’s inaction. “The government provides training for other volunteers, such as magistrates,” she said. Evelyn Forde, the ASCL vice-chair, said systemic racism is “such a massive problem in education when it comes to recruitment that we’re now putting our heads above the parapet to name it”. She added: “The issue is specifically that governing boards – which are largely monocultural – tend to choose heads who look and sound like them.” School governors – only 4% of whom are from a minority ethnic background – are untrained, unpaid volunteers who require no formal qualifications. The role of trustees in academies and multi-academy trusts is very similar to that of governors in state-maintained schools. It is six years since Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former chief inspector of schools in England and former head of Ofsted, said too many school governors and trustees were not fit for purpose and called for mandatory training. Since then, he has said, not enough has changed. “I am deeply disappointed that there has been such little progress on this recommendation,” he said. Like the NGA and the ASCL, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has been asking the government for years to introduce mandatory training for governors. “Despite the data proving massive ethnic under-representation among headteachers – which the government itself admits is unacceptable – they’ve resisted introducing even the most basic of mandatory training,” said Natalie Arnett, a senior NAHT equalities officer. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahaw,i has admitted that there are not enough black headteachers working in schools in England. The Department for Education declined to comment on the government’s refusal to introduce training for governors, pointing instead to their programme to increase diversity among governing bodies. But Jack Worth, the school workforce lead at the National Foundation for Economic Research, said that “before we can solve the problem of lack of ethnic diversity among headteachers, we need to know where the biggest problems lie”. Worth says current evidence on racial equality in England’s teaching workforce is fragmented and incomplete. “Is it that monocultural governing bodies don’t select headteachers of colour – or is it that not enough teachers from ethnic minority backgrounds are being recruited and retained at the other end of the pipeline: just 14.3% of teachers in state-funded schools come from ethnic minority backgrounds?”",News/Education,School governors in England to be offered anti-racism training,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/25/school-governors-england-offered-anti-racism-training
1/25/2022,"The best outfit in which to weather a pandemic? Try a bouclé suit, two-tone kitten heels and a chain-strap handbag with a double C logo. In defiance of all business forecasts, Chanel is emerging from two challenging years for retail virtually unscathed. Revenues at the luxury brand grew by double digits in the first six months of 2021, the most recent period for which earnings have been published, and the house expects soon to return to 2019 levels of profitability. Strong demand has led to eye-watering price hikes, with some classic handbag styles now priced at 40% more than in the first months of 2020. In anxious times, it seems a Chanel handbag is the gold bullion of fashion.  The late Karl Lagerfeld, who adored a grand party and featured rocket launches and surprise concerts in his shows, would surely have made the first Chanel catwalk of the year a showstopper, with enough action sequences and inside-joke Easter eggs to fill a Marvel movie. But Virginie Viard, who took over at Chanel three years ago, designs fashion rather than fashion shows. The elegant, minimalist show set was created by the French artist Xavier Veilhan using plywood walkways and inflatable bench seating. A raked-sand catwalk nodded to racecourses while the uneven hillocks for spectators were, a Chanel spokesperson said, inspired by minigolf courses. A few graphic metal sculptures silently rotated, like wagon wheels or stately spindles. Guests were required to show proof of vaccination and a negative antigen result on entry, with N95 masks a mandatory dress code, and social distancing observed on the benches. The show began with Chanel ambassador Charlotte Casiraghi making a lap of the room on horseback, marking the second time that Viard has featured a horse in one of her shows. Viard is quietly moving her Chanel closer to the spare elegance of Coco, albeit with a dose of Lagerfeld’s 1980s pomp thrown in for fun. Not only was Coco Chanel a keen equestrian who owned a racehorse, Romantica, she was also a pioneer in liberating female riders from cumbersome riding skirts. In the 1920s Chanel designed her own breeches, based on those worn by men but adjusted to flatter her shape. She styled her breeches and riding boots with a white shirt and tailored wool vest for a modern, elegant look which helped set a new trend. These nuggets of Coco Chanel’s spirit and energy are to Viard’s Chanel shows what showbiz set-pieces were to Lagerfeld’s. When the models emerged, the first six outfits featured trousers, rather than the traditional skirts. A simple navy tweed trouser suit came first, followed by a dressier take on the same look, with silver edging and balloon shaped trousers. Each look was slightly fancier than the last, but in subtle gradations. There was a jazzy caramel tweed, followed by a jacket worn with feathered trousers, and then a lavender jacket paired with white culottes with laser embroidery. Two-tone Mary Jane shoes and simple dancing dresses with wide-set straps brought a 1920s feel to evening wear. Even the bride who closed the show as per haute couture tradition looked casual, in a loose dress and no veil. Viard highlighted as a key piece a long gown entirely embroidered by the venerated Lesage atelier with “constructivist camellias” in black, white and coral beads, which she described as “references [which] also belong to Gabrielle Chanel, of course. It’s like a conversation that crosses time.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Chanel channels Coco with casual twist to classic designs,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/25/chanel-channels-coco-with-casual-twist-to-classic-designs
1/25/2022,"Had Derby beaten Aston Villa in the 2019 Championship play-off final, the outlook would surely be different. Mel Morris, a local businessman, bet the ranch and lost in his attempt to return Derby to the Premier League for the first time since 2008. They have spent 125 days in administration and are in a race against time to secure a preferred bidder who can fund the club until the end of the season and complete a takeover. The English Football League’s findings over the former chairman’s valuations of players led to a total 21-point deduction this season. “I’m most unhappy with Mel Morris – he is why we’re in this situation,” the manager, Wayne Rooney, said on Friday.  Derby do not have cash to cover bills beyond the January payroll and the EFL has asked them to provide proof of funds to fulfil their remaining fixtures by next Tuesday or risk expulsion. The cost of running the club is about £1.5m a month. The ideal solution is for the administrator, Quantuma, to identify a preferred bidder and move to complete a takeover, but it could also secure additional lending or – and this is seen as the last resort – sell players. Rooney has been reassured that no player will leave without his say-so. The captain, Tom Lawrence, and academy graduates Festy Ebosele and Louie Sibley are attracting firm interest. Derby are unable to make signings or offer contract extensions, which led to Phil Jagielka joining Stoke when his deal expired. The 18-year-old scholar Dylan Williams was sold to Chelsea for what is understood to be a six-figure fee. Derby were unable to offer a professional contract. The administrator remains confident of an agreement, with at least three parties still at the table. Last week the Binnie family, founders of the investment firm Carlisle Capital, submitted a bid worth about £28m, which they believe to be the asking price, and that could trigger the former Derby chairman Andrew Appleby or former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley into bidding. Crucially, the club are thought to have had positive conversations with the preferential creditor, HMRC, over an agreement to pay significantly less than the £29.3m they owe. The Binnies are understood to accept any liabilities relating to lawsuits the club face from Middlesbrough and Wycombe, both of whom believe Derby knowingly skirted EFL rules to gain an advantage at their expense, but the bid does not cover Derby’s Pride Park stadium, which is owned by Morris, or training ground, which is leased from the Locko Estate. Under EFL rules, any buyer must pay football creditors – such as Arsenal, whom Derby owe for Krystian Bielik – 100% of what they are owed and unsecured creditors – such as player agencies and small businesses – at least 25% of what they are owed, or the club would face a 15-point penalty next season. Some fans are concerned at what they perceive to be slow progress but this may be the most complex football administration ever. “We are working tirelessly to achieve a successful outcome and still believe this is possible,” Quantuma said last week. “We understand the frustrations of the supporters.” The clubs’ claims for compensation have proved a major obstacle, leading to a blame game. Middlesbrough started their claim more than 12 months ago and Wycombe last year after relegation to League One. It is unclear whether the clubs would be deemed football creditors if they succeed in their claims, which Derby consider spurious. Boro, whose owner, Steve Gibson, has branded Derby cheats, are seeking about £45m after being pipped to a Championship play-off place by Derby in 2019, and Wycombe at least £6m because Derby stayed up by a point at their expense after breaking league rules. Last week the Wycombe owner, Rob Couhig, told BBC Radio Derby his club were wrongly painted as “the bad guys”, saying Derby were guilty of “getting their hand caught in the cookie jar”. He added: “We are willing to meet and talk with people and make a reasonable commercial compromise.” On Monday the EFL said a meeting between league officials, local MPs and councillors was postponed “to allow additional progress to be made by the administrators”. It alluded to “positive developments” last weekend and expects to hold talks with Quantuma on Tuesday to seek clarity regarding a preferred bidder. Last week the league said it “has no vendetta against” the club and wants “to work proactively with the administrators and relevant stakeholders to find a process which will give clarity quickly”. Rooney has shown his players a league table minus the points deduction, which has Derby mid-table, to motivate his squad and he has given his number to the supporters’ trust to strengthen the bond with fans. Supporter groups have appealed to fans to buy tickets for Sunday’s home game against Birmingham, expected to attract their biggest crowd of the season, and they discussed selling “virtual tickets” at a meeting with the administrator. The trust has highlighted the human impact on fans, some of who have raised mental health concerns, with many sharing their #MyDerbyStory on social media.",Sport/Football,What is going on at Derby and will club survive?

1/25/2022," My parents had just split up, and my mum, caring for two young daughters, took us to Bournemouth for a few days to get away. It was the year Jurassic Park came out and she would have been about 36, a few years older than I am now. She found a tape of Bat Out of Hell in a bargain bin at a service station on the drive there and the second she put it into the tape player in the car and heard the opening track, she was hooked. As kids, we loved it too – it was so fun, theatrical and a bit naughty. We played that tape over and over on our car journeys. I saw how his music empowered my mum and made her feel good at a very vulnerable and painful time. He has brought her pure joy since she found that tape and his songs remind me of the close bond my mum, sister and I share. Vicky, 33, editor, London My grandfather David Watson, or “Papa” as I knew him, passed away on 13 January 2022 at the age of 84. He was dearly loved by us all and will be forever missed. He was also a huge Meat Loaf fan. At every family gathering Papa would call insistently for someone to play [Paradise By the] Dashboard Light or Dead Ringer for Love over and over again until we were sick of it. He went to a Meat Loaf concert in Glasgow’s SEC Centre with his wife, my late gran Ria Watson, in around 2013, when he was already well into his 70s. Almost every time I visited him, he would eagerly play Meat Loaf’s music videos from his iPad to the television for us to watch. Papa and his Meat Loaf songs became a running joke in the family, but it rubbed off on us all; my dad played Bat Out of Hell so often growing up that me and my two brothers, now all in our 20s, could probably recite the whole album backwards. We were stunned by the news that Meat Loaf passed away just one week after our beloved Papa. Bat Out of Hell is my favourite album of all time and a Watson family staple, and although we were saddened by the loss of the man, the myth, the legend himself, it was unbelievable to us that his death followed that of his biggest fan by just one week. I will always think fondly of Meat Loaf, not only due to the prevalence of his music in my childhood, but how my memories of it are intertwined with my Papa. Emma Watson, 26, recent graduate, Lesmahagow, Scotland Bat Out of Hell remains my favourite rock album and gets airplay often, but the greatest joy was in finding out that my mum used to put it on my hi-fi when I was at work and sing along while she did the housework. That secret only came out many years after I left home. I can see her in my mind’s eye head-banging to Bat Out of Hell while pushing the vacuum around. Pat Condon, procurement professional, Blackpool My first boyfriend introduced me to Meat Loaf in the early 2000s, and “our song” was Heaven Can Wait. The relationship didn’t last, but I’ve loved the music ever since. When I married my husband, Dead Ringer for Love played at the end of the ceremony. (We joked about having Paradise by the Dashboard Light, complete with baseball commentary, as our first dance.) When I phone him, his ringtone is You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth. Meat Loaf’s music may have been overblown and rather silly but it never took itself too seriously, and sometimes you need that in life. Anna, 36, charity fundraiser, West Midlands I got into my hero Meat Loaf as an eight-year-old boy when a friend of my parents’ brought a tape to a party. I couldn’t stop listening to it and I haven’t stopped listening to Meat Loaf since. I was lucky enough to meet him four times and see him live many more. He will live on through his music for decades to come. Let’s just hope he’s rocking with Jim Steinman, wherever they may be. Eric Dickson, 35, East Lothian I discovered Meat Loaf when I was about 15 and Modern Girl played on the radio. I was hooked. I listened constantly on my cutting-edge Sony Walkman cassette player, especially on my way to and from school. I saw him perform live about 15 times, the first in 1986, in Wembley Arena. I went with a group of school friends. We missed the last train home after the concert and spent the night in the waiting room at Shenfield railway station, our ears ringing with the music and the incredible performance. There was no sleep that night, just singing his songs and discussing our amazing experience until the first train home at 5am. When I met my partner, Lore, at the age of 18, it was Meat Loaf’s music that provided the soundtrack to our dates and relationship. We are still together today, sharing the enjoyment and memories of his music. Meat Loaf was by my side musically for almost 37 years and he will remain so until the day I also have to accept that Heaven Can No Longer Wait. Frank, 52, Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex I was first introduced to Meat Loaf at age seven. My dad had an old cassette and I remember constantly listening to Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad. Having been diagnosed with autism at a very young age, Meat Loaf was my way of communicating with a world I felt closed out from. In 2010, I bought my first Meat Loaf album, Hang Cool Teddy Bear. It was at this point my life totally changed. As a devoted fan, I became a member of the Mad About Meatloaf fan club, where I eventually worked my way to becoming a moderator. In September 2021, I had the opportunity to sit down with Meat Loaf in Concord, North Carolina, and spent almost 45 minutes one-to-one with him. The stories and the wisdom he shared with me were priceless. I told him I wanted to be a published author, and he replied it does not matter what the readers may think – as long as I write a book that I’m passionate about and am proud of, I will find my true audience. Before our meeting came to a close, Meat Loaf gave me a huge hug and thanked me for all I do for his fan club. His passing has definitely left not only a huge hole in my life, but many fans around the world as well. He has been a true inspiration in my life and will be truly missed. Sammy Mosteller, 25, Lincolnton, North Carolina, USA Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell show in the summer of 1978 was the first rock concert I ever attended, and in my memory it is still one of the best I’ve seen. At the end of the show, he threw away his microphone and sang without it! That became my benchmark for future rock concerts, which unfortunately was never reached again. Wolfgang Schindler, 59, Hamburg, Germany When I was seven, I spent a year wearing a leg brace to help treat a condition called Perthes disease that affected my hip. I spent most of that year being pushed around in a wheelchair while listening to cassettes through my headphones. When the news of Meat Loaf’s death broke, I was reminded of a cassette that soundtracked that year: a compilation album of Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler tracks. I’m still not entirely sure how that compilation came to exist or even how a copy of it came in to my ownership. I’m very glad that it did, as I credit that year as being one of the reasons I developed such a love of music, where Meat Loaf was front and centre. And who can forget his performance in Fight Club? He will be missed by many. Lee, 32, music industry worker, London I still have my Meat Loaf ticket from Newcastle City Hall, 27 November 1984. From the moment I heard the Bat Out of Hell album in the late 70s, I’ve been a fan and I listen to his music still, at full volume. While Meat Loaf is inextricably linked with Steinman’s lyrics, one of my favourites is his cover of Dylan’s Forever Young. That’s how his music makes me feel.

1/25/2022,"Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage has taken aim at Disney for what he called its “fucking backwards” forthcoming live action adaptation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Dinklage, who stars in Joe Wright’s new film, Cyrano, accused the studio of double standards by attending to racial diversity in its cast but falling back on other damaging stereotypes.  “I was a little taken aback by [the fact] they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White,” Dinklage told podcaster Marc Maron, “but you’re still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”. Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, continued by saying Disney should have stepped back and reassessed the project. “You’re progressive in one way but you’re still making that fucking backward story of seven dwarves living in the cave. What the fuck are you doing, man? Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soapbox? I guess I’m not loud enough. “They were so proud of that, and all love and respect to the actress and the people who thought they were doing the right thing but I’m just like, ‘What are you doing?’” Dinklage added that had a “cool, progressive spin” been put on the fairytale, he would have been “all in”. The remake stars Rachel Zegler, fresh from her acclaimed debut in West Side Story, with Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. Directed by Marc Webb, the film is said to be an adaptation and an extension of the 1937 Disney animated classic – itself taken from a Brothers Grimm story. Updated version Snow White and the Huntsman, starring Kristen Stewart, met with a backlash on release a decade ago after the dwarves were played by actors of average height – including Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane – whose faces were digitally transmuted on to small bodies. Lobbying group Little People of America likened the move to “blackface” and threatened to mount a “100-midget march”.",Arts/Film,Peter Dinklage criticises Disney for ‘backwards’ remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/25/peter-dinklage-disney-remake-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs
1/25/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  Well. There’s only one thing I was going to be talking about in this week’s Pushing Buttons, isn’t there? Since Microsoft very inconsiderately announced the biggest acquisition in gaming history just after last week’s edition went out, the entire games industry has been in a flap. The $69bn deal to buy Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Overwatch publisher Activision Blizzard absolutely dwarfs the $7.5bn that the house of Xbox paid for Zenimax/Bethesda in 2020, which already had me feeling slightly uneasy about the amount of cash being thrown around by giant corporations (see also Tencent, whose run of acquisitions shows no sign of slowing down.) This is more money than either of Microsoft’s competitors in gaming – Sony and Nintendo – could dream of shelling out. The acquisition instantly wiped $20bn off Sony’s share price, which gives some indication of the sheer force of this power play. But as I wrote in an analysis of the deal last week, this is about much more than games consoles: Microsoft wants to control as much of the gaming market as possible in future, and it’s doing this through investing in content rather than hardware. The bet is that we’ll mostly be playing games via streaming subscription services in the not too distant future, and if you have to pay £15 a month or however much to play Call of Duty via Game Pass, that future will certainly arrive sooner. Here’s what’s rankling me about this deal though, now that the dust is settling (and assuming that it gets past US regulators, who are supposedly cracking down on big tech companies and their drive to monopolise). Activision Blizzard has, of course, been at the centre of a string of scandals stretching back nearly a year – including allegations implicating its CEO Bobby Kotick, who, alleges the WSJ, knew about sexual misconduct allegations at Activision studios and failed to do anything about them. Kotick denies the allegations. Bloomberg reports that Kotick is expected to leave once this deal goes through, but instead of resigning after employees walked out and demanded his removal, one of the highest-paid execs in the world is now looking at the biggest paycheck of his life. Can we just remember for a second that Microsoft’s Xbox chief Phil Spencer said he was “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at Activision Blizzard in an email to staff last November, when this deal would have been in the works? No doubt that’s true, but the deal is still going ahead, isn’t it. As ever with these scandals, the actual consequences for those in power seem to be minimal. Even in the days before the deal broke, there were reports that Kotick had held back reports on the scale of layoffs related to workplace misconduct. The Activision Blizzard King Worker’s Alliance – some of whom recently succeeded in forming a union, albeit one comprising just a few dozen of its nearly 10,000 employees – have said that they will not halt their efforts to organise and advocate for themselves. Many of these people have been working under tight deadlines on annualised franchises such as Call of Duty for a long, long time, for a boss who considered anything less than a billion-dollar success to be a failure. Under Microsoft, with its much bigger portfolio of games, that approach may well be different. Whatever my reservations about the shape of the games industry in years to come as a result of this deal, I hope it brings with it meaningful, positive change for the people who actually make games, along with the inevitable payday for shareholders and executives. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is out on PlayStation 5 later this week and reminds us why developer Naughty Dog is regarded as the master of narrative action games. This is 2016’s Uncharted 4 – which in its first few hours has surely the cutest relationship scene in video games – packaged with its actually-more-interesting female buddy-movie spin-off Lost Legacy, alongside some visual upgrades (not that either of these games really needed them). They are sumptuously good-looking, well-performed globetrotting adventures, and though I always get annoyed at how little influence you actually have over what happens, they are always a fun ride. The Last of Us remains my favourite Naughty Dog series, but it’s also really serious and intense, proper horrors-of-humanity stuff. Uncharted is good clean Indiana Jones-style capers – it might have the high body count typical of all action games, but it doesn’t try to make you feel bad about it. Available on: PlayStation 5 from 28 JanuaryApproximate playtime: 15-20 hours for Uncharted 4, 7-10 for Lost Legacy Just to keep the good vibes going, Polygon has a report on claims of extensive crunch – that’s unpaid overtime, still rife in games despite increasing pushback from, well, everyone – at British Lego games developer Traveller’s Tales. In response, the company told Polygon Traveller’s Tales is “committed to creating a respectful, fair and inclusive workplace for every employee”. Also on Polygon, here’s an actually-good-vibes story about the entertainingly persistent French developers who brought back Windjammers, a little-known but intensely loved sports game from 1990. Played Pokémon Snap last year, the Pokémon photography safari game? Heard of Pupperazzi, the dog-snapping game that is essentially a meme fleshed out in code? You may enjoy this Eurogamer feature on the photography-games trend, which speaks to the people behind some lesser-known stars of the genre – such as TOEM, a chill, surreal, black-and-white small-town adventure. Will Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard finally bring scrutiny on the video game industry? I’ve seen the metaverse – and I don’t want it Rainbow Six Extraction review – Call of Duty’s zombie mode crossed with XCOM’s alien invaders Reader Martin Shore provides today’s question, which I couldn’t resist answering myself: Is there a video game remaster or remake you’d love to see that’s not already been announced? I’m lucky in that I grew up with Nintendo, which means that many of the landmark games of my childhood have been remastered. Some still haven’t, though. I’d love to see a proper remake of Super Mario 64 or – especially – Zelda: Majora’s Mask, though I’m not sure its creepy angular art style would have the same eerie effect outside the polygonal confines of the N64. (Playing the Link’s Awakening remake on my Switch made me long for a similar treatment for A Link To The Past, incidentally, though you could argue that the 3DS’ Zelda: A Link Between Worlds was kinda that.) My ultimate unlikely remake request would have been Demon’s Souls, but that actually happened, and it was amazing. Here’s another, though: 1997’s original post-apocalyptic RPG, Fallout 1. It is an absolute mess to look at these days but the game is darkly brilliant and the dialogue and writing are better than any of the modern Fallouts. I’d settle for a visual refresh, but imagine a 3D remake … If you’ve got a question for Question block or anything to say about the newsletter, email us on pushingbuttons@guardian.co.uk.",Arts/Games,Pushing Buttons: the Microsoft-Activision deal is a chance to transform game development,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/25/pushing-buttons-activision-blizzard-microsoft
1/25/2022,"Brody Dalle has testified that her ex-husband Josh Homme head-butted her so hard she “saw stars”, and told her that he had fantasised about murdering her, on the first day of a trial dealing with conflicting domestic violence restraining orders that each party filed against the other, Rolling Stone reports. Dalle told a Los Angeles courtroom that the Queens of the Stone Age frontman attacked her in October 2019 during a discussion about their respective musical output.  “We were talking about touring, and he was thinking about putting a tour right when my record was coming out. I hadn’t released a record in a very, very long time, and I said, ‘I would never do that to you.’ I said, ‘It’s weird and competitive.’ “And he said, ‘Competitive? You think you’re my competition? I want to fucking strangle you right now.’ And he came up to the bed and he got on top of me and screamed, ‘You’re a fucking insane bitch.’ And I had my arms up in a foetal position, and he grabbed my wrist and pulled me out of bed on to the floor. I was terrified.” She claimed that the following month, Homme said he had fantasised about killing her and head-butted her in the right temple so hard that she blacked out. “My head went back, and I was on the ground. He bent down and he said, ‘You fucking faker.’” She said he told her: “‘I’ve been thinking about wanting to kill you, and if I killed you, no one would know, because you’d be dead.’ I was in shock. I couldn’t believe that he would say something like that,” said Dalle, who claimed he was intoxicated during the alleged assault. After the alleged head-butting, Dalle filed for a restraining order and initiated divorce proceedings. The couple married in December 2005. They have a 16-year-old daughter and sons aged 10 and five. She told the court that after Homme attended rehab, they successfully co-parented until Homme allegedly turned violent during a custodial exchange of their sons last June, punching her car window, refusing to let her close her door and verbally assaulting her. Dalle said Homme was upset because their daughter refused to go to his house. In August 2021 Homme filed a restraining order against Dalle, claiming that she “angrily slammed her car door into my body, causing significant bruising”. He said she had also punched him in the face on “several occasions”, thrown objects “such as her handbag and an iron” at him, and called him “derogatory names”. The following month, Dalle unsuccessfully filed for a restraining order against Homme on behalf of her and their children. It accused him of grabbing, flicking and hitting the children, as well as drink driving and making threats against Dalle’s partner. Homme denied the charges. Their daughter, however, was granted her own temporary restraining order against Homme, ordering him to remain 100 yards away from her and stipulating no contact. Homme was granted 15-minute FaceTime calls with his sons every other day. This week’s hearing is the latest development in a complex case. In November, Homme successfully sought criminal contempt charges against Dalle for violating a court order when she refused to hand over their five-year-old son on 3 September 2021. She was sentenced to 60 hours of community service and a $1,000 (£742) fine. That judge found that the couple’s older children had resisted seeing Homme of their own accord owing to concerns about his sobriety and alleged threats against Dalle and her partner Gunner Foxx. Homme filed for a civil harassment restraining order against Foxx on 12 November, claiming that he was intentionally interfering in his relationships and custodial time with his sons. In January, Foxx was granted an emergency stay-away order by a judge after Homme allegedly threatened and injured him during a confrontation at a shopping mall on Christmas eve, Rolling Stone reports. In November, Homme told the judge he was “willing to take responsibility for things that I do” but wanted “justice” and “one set of rules for both sides”.

1/25/2022,"Cost pressures for Britain’s factories are growing at their fastest pace since 1980 as companies struggle to find workers to meet growing demand, a leading business lobby group has said. The CBI warned that higher manufactured goods prices were inevitable after its monthly healthcheck of industry showed labour shortages at their most acute in almost half a century.  The survey of 236 firms found orders picking up over the three months to January, but output growth was limited by bottlenecks. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, said: “Global supply-chain challenges are continuing to impact UK firms, with our survey showing intense and escalating cost and price pressures.” According to the CBI’s industrial trends survey: Average costs growth accelerated at the fastest pace since April 1980. Average domestic price growth in the quarter to January was similar to October, which was the highest figure since April 1980 and is anticipated to accelerate over the next three months. Average export prices in the quarter to January grew at their quickest pace since April 1980 and price growth is again expected to pick up over the coming quarter. The share of firms citing skilled labour as a factor likely to limit output next quarter rose to its highest since October 1973. The annual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer prices index hit its highest level in almost 30 years in December, and is set to climb further from 5.4% to at least 6% over the coming months. Newton-Smith said government action was needed to ease cost pressures from spiralling energy bills and to encourage investment. “It’s good to see firms looking to invest more in training and retraining as labour shortages continue to bite. And planned increases in spending on plant and machinery is a welcome sign of much-needed strengthening in business investment. Further fiscal measures to get more firms investing will be needed to set the UK on a long-term path to sustainable growth. “Meanwhile, against the backdrop of rising energy prices, which are adding to inflationary pressures, short-term action is needed from the UK government to find urgent solutions for firms that are struggling.”",News/Business,"UK factory costs rising at fastest pace since 1980, CBI says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/uk-factory-costs-rising-at-fastest-pace-since-1980-cbi-says
1/25/2022,"The manager of an exclusive New York City restaurant insisted it was focused on the safety of its guests, after the former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin dined there despite not being vaccinated against Covid-19.  New York City laws require proof of vaccination for indoor dining. The city government said Palin should “follow the rules just like everyone else”. Palin tested positive repeatedly on Monday, delaying the start of her defamation trial against the New York Times in Manhattan federal court. Palin, who also tested positive in March last year, has said she will not get vaccinated. In December, she told a conservative audience in Phoenix: “It’ll be over my dead body that I’ll have to get a shot. I will not do that. I won’t do it, and they better not touch my kids either.” In a statement, Luca Guaitolini, manager of Elio’s, the restaurant on the Upper East Side, responded to the news Palin was seen eating there on Saturday. “We are taking this isolated incident – and unfortunate oversight – very seriously,” Guaitolini said. “Elio’s adheres to and believes in the vaccine mandate, and all it is doing to protect our staff, regulars and the dining public.” Guaitolini said he was not working on Saturday. He told the Times first-time diners were checked but Palin dined with an unidentified “regular”. “She probably just walked in and strolled over” to the table, Guaitolini said. “We are trying to get to the bottom of this.” In his statement, he said: “My focus right now is on the safety of my staff who worked the floor that night, and on our guests.” The restaurant was contacting diners to let them know of possible exposure, he said. The New York city government said: “The Key to NYC rules were put in place to protect all New Yorkers – including the small businesses that power our city’s economy.” “Ms Palin needs to respect small business workers and follow the rules just like everyone else.” Palin did not comment. On Monday night, she confirmed her Covid test and told Fox News she felt “totally fine”. She also declined to comment on her case against the Times, over a 2017 editorial on her comments about gun violence. The Times said Elio’s, open at East 84th and Second Avenue since 1981, was known for “famous clientele” including Tom Hanks, Joan Didion and Mick Jagger. The paper also cited an obituary for the restaurant’s founder, Elio Guaitolini, which described “an informal clubhouse for Manhattan’s social and media elite”. The founder’s son said Palin was “a controversial person wherever she goes” and wished her “a speedy convalescence”. Among New Yorkers who spotted Palin dining at Elio’s, Shawn McCreesh, a writer for New York magazine, alluded to a famous impression of the politician on a New York City institution, Saturday Night Live. “My mom thought she was Tina Fey,” he tweeted.",News/US news,Sarah Palin dined at New York City restaurant days before testing positive,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/sarah-palin-dined-new-york-city-restaurant-days-before-testing-positive
