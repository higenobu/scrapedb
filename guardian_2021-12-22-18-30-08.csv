12/22/2021,"There’s no need for a blue pill. The Matrix Resurrections is, by and large, an engaging and energetic motion picture, and worthy of being on the same shelf as the groundbreaking original from 1999. Unlike the soul-crushingly dull previous entry, The Matrix Revolutions, it remembers that mind-scrambling pseudo-intellectual yammering gets tiresome on-screen if there isn’t also some fun. Luckily, director Lana Wachowski, working apart from her sister Lilly for the first time, and her screenwriting partners David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon, have included plenty of flashbacks. A rewatch isn’t absolutely necessary. But talking about the new one after you see it is.  After an introduction to new characters (who are somehow inside the first scene of The Matrix? Is this the Holodeck?) we check back in with Keanu Reeves’s Neo, only he’s back as an office drone, plugging away as Thomas Anderson. It’s no longer 1999, it’s 2021, or so we think. Could this be the true base reality, not the story of The Nebuchadnezzar and The One liberating Zion from The Architect and the Machines? If so, then The Matrix trilogy as we know it was just a game series that Anderson created, and the peculiar feeling he has about the world around him is something he needs to work through with his analyst, played by Neil Patrick Harris. But the line between fiction and reality in Anderson’s life gets even blurrier at the same time that it does in The Matrix Resurrections’s script. In a wildly self-referential turn, Anderson is informed that he must make a sequel to his original Matrix trilogy, as corporate overlords Warner Bros are going to do it with or without his involvement. (This is, essentially, what happened to Wachowski in the weirdest reality of all: Hollywood.) It gets stranger when we see how Anderson based his soulmate Trinity on a gal he sees at his local coffee shop (called the Simulatte, ha ha ha), played by Carrie-Anne Moss, who also has a sense something about the world is off. Anderson’s niggling unease inspires him to create a “modal”, a little program that independently tries to get to the root of the fabric of existence. Two things happen: first, a program (played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) assumes the identity of Morpheus, Laurence Fishburne’s character from the original trilogy. (We’ll discover the real Morpheus died a while ago, and it’s been a lot longer than the 20 years we think has passed.) The other strange thing about this modal is that a hacker named Bugs (Jessica Henwick) from “the real world” (the world where Neo, Trinity and Morpheus once fought for Zion) somehow (and don’t ask me how) gets into Anderson’s new modal. This all makes sense, it really does. But the big question is what, exactly, is this new Matrix that Anderson (and Moss’s “Tiffany”) find themselves in? I think we’re all going to need a second viewing to nail this down, but the most interesting aspect is how Harris’s Analyst, basically serving the same purpose as the original trilogy’s Architect, has found a way to draw more power out of pod-sleeping humans by tormenting them with what we in the Jewish faith call tsuris. Heartache, woe and general bad vibes certainly seem ubiquitous of late, and The Matrix Resurrections suggests this is due to a malevolent computer program pushing our psyches for a little extra juice. Of course, what the Analyst doesn’t realise is that an even stronger force emerges when Neo and Trinity work together: the power of true love. When Anderson and his group of game developers are mapping out their sequel, they realise that there was something ineffable about the first Matrix. Yes, all the heavy metaphysics was part of it, but it also looked cool! The new entry will need to find its “bullet time”, the effect from the 1999 movie in which Neo arched backward, the camera swirled around, and time seemed to stand still. The Analyst even mentions it when he is tormenting Anderson/Neo during a moment of great peril, but nothing on the screen pops just yet. The “holy crap, what am I seeing?” moment comes during the final chase, in which the new iteration of Agent Smith possesses the bodies plugged into the Matrix in an attempt to kill Neo and Trinity. The 2.0 version is called swarm mode, and this time, anyone sleeping or working in a high-rise building that happens to be looming above Trinity’s racing Ducati will suddenly get a weird look in their eyes and dive out the window, becoming a human torpedo. It’s one of the most bonkers visuals in any Matrix movie. During that montage of the brainstorming game developers there’s some rapid dialogue about what The Matrix trilogy is really about. Somewhere in the mix of theories someone says that it is about transgender issues. (Lilly Wachowski indeed discussed this explicitly last year.) There’s much in the new entry that adds to this conversation. Firstly, the game that Anderson is currently struggling with (and abandons) is called Binary. Then there’s the entire third act of the movie, in which Neo and his gang try to rescue Trinity from her sleeping life as Tiffany, a bored, married women. She knows that her true self is the one that pairs with Neo as a martial arts-savvy badass, but it is far easier to stay submerged in the role the false society has written for her. Neo stresses that she’ll only be happy as Trinity if it is her choice, and she backs away, worried that she’s been acting as Tiffany so long that it is simply too late. That sentiment – feeling that it is too late to transition – is a common issue for many trans people, so this exchange between Trinity and Neo will likely resonate. As will Moss telling the dopey husband character (whose name is actually Chad) to stop deadnaming her, and to call her Trinity. Lastly, there’s the film’s final reveal, where it seems that in the new Matrix, most of the special powers (such as flying) have transitioned from the male Neo to the female Trinity. A movie as wild as The Matrix Resurrections has many little treasures (a cruise through something called “the fetus fields” is just one of them) but the hits keep coming during the credits. As with the 1999 Matrix, the movie ends with the song Wake Up by Rage Against the Machine, but this time it’s a cover with a female vocalist. The new version is by the group Brass Against, and if that name sounds familiar it either means you love rock anthems featuring a sousaphone, or you remember the incident from mid-November in which the group’s lead singer Sophia Urista pulled down her pants, squatted over a fan and urinated on him during a performance. (While the fan appeared to be consenting, the janitorial staff at the venue surely were not!) Of course, there’s no way Lana Wachowski could have predicted Brass Against’s current stream of notoriety, but it’s further proof that she’s still got the golden touch.",Arts/Film,"The Matrix Resurrections: the bonkers visuals, the love story and the final reveal – discuss with spoilers",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/22/the-matrix-resurrections-the-bonkers-visuals-the-love-story-and-the-final-reveal-discuss-with-spoilers
12/22/2021,"Britons are many times more likely to have experienced shortages of food and fuel than people in half a dozen EU member states, according to a poll. Global supply chain problems prompted by the pandemic have disrupted the international trade network since the summer, with transport backlogs combining with labour shortages to create scarcities of various goods around the world.  The government has argued that the shortages are part of a worldwide pattern and no worse in the UK than elsewhere, although logistics and experts – particularly in the food sector – have said the problems are amplified in Britain by a loss of east European workers and drivers since Brexit. The YouGov poll showed residents of the UK were multiple times more likely to have experienced, or to know people who have experienced, shortages of food and fuel than people in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Denmark, and somewhat more likely to have experienced them than those in the US. Asked in early December whether they had personally experienced any scarcity of foodstuffs in recent weeks, 56% of respondents in the UK said yes, while 9% said they had not personally experienced any but knew people who had. The corresponding figures in the US were 49% and 10%. In continental Europe, 0the proportion of people who said they had been personally affected was between three and nine times lower: 18% in Germany, 16% in France, 12% in Sweden, 8% in Denmark, 7% and 6% in Italy. The proportion saying they knew people who had experienced food shortages ranged from 13% in France to 8% in Denmark and Italy – where 58% of respondents said they were not even aware that supply chain problems had led to food shortages. The UK was also the only country where substantial numbers of people said they had experienced fuel shortages in recent weeks, since the crisis in September and October. One in three Britons (33%) said they had personally experienced a recent scarcity of fuel, compared with no more than 10% in any other country. Only 8% of German respondents, 7% of those in France and 5% of those in Italy said they had been personally experienced fuel scarcity, with 37%, 38% and 53% respectively saying they had not even heard of the issue – compared with just 11% of respondents in Britain.",News/Business,"Food shortages hitting Britons more than many in EU, poll finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/food-shortages-hitting-britons-more-than-many-in-eu-poll-finds
12/22/2021,"At one level, it feels pedantic, three days before Christmas, to be debating the difference between a formal mask mandate and a strong recommendation to wear a mask. But this distinction is important when public health risks are real, and governments of Australia have spent much of this pandemic congratulating themselves for listening to experts and following the health advice.  If you’ve missed the mask fracas, let’s summarise it quickly. New South Wales is experiencing a surge of new infections as people head off for their summer break, but the premier, Dominic Perrottet clearly does not want to impose a general mask mandate. Scott Morrison has been backing in the NSW premier, trialing a new mantra. The prime minister says people need to take personal responsibility for managing their own risks rather than wait passively for instructions. In the context of moving from pandemic to endemic, Morrison’s point is valid enough. People do need to exercise more personal responsibility as we make this transition. But the current health advice is just that: current. It reflects current risk assessments. It reflects what is known right now about the threat posed by the Omicron variant and what remains unknown. Are we there yet isn’t the test. The advice reflects on-balance judgments by experts about present risk. When the risks are life and death, the nuances have meaning. They matter. So let’s be clear because the health advice is very clear. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) has recommended that face masks be worn in indoor settings “particularly in high-risk settings”. The advice also says “masks should be mandated in all indoor settings” including retail, hospitality and entertainment. The experts say implementation of mask-wearing measures “should occur prior to Omicron case escalation to have maximum benefit” – which is a polite way of saying do it. Now. Do not mess around. Get the masks on your people. This is not a drill. Given compulsion is a way of being clear with people – a way of telling people preventive behaviour has value – some jurisdictions have already imposed mandates in line with the AHPPC guidance. But despite possessing that very clear advice, Morrison walked out of a meeting of the national cabinet on Wednesday afternoon and declined to use the word mandate in relation to mask wearing. Now the prime minister did strongly encourage people to wear masks in indoor settings. At the end of his remarks, he also demonstrated putting on his mask before he retreated indoors (see what he did there) to his office. But the prime minister vaulted right over the “M” word. “Ms” were for someone else. Some other nanny state-ist busybody. Not him. Morrison told reporters any “public health social measures” (regulations or directions in other words) were “always determined by states and territories … not by the commonwealth government”. Technically this is true. The states do issue the directions (although the commonwealth has invoked its own seeping biosecurity powers to manage this crisis). But Morrison’s new script is not only selective – it erases the custom and practice of the very recent past. The prime minister has never been shy of telling the premiers and chief ministers what he thinks they should be doing in the interests of their constituents. Morrison also, famously, pushed mandatory vaccinations for workers in the aged care sector – and not in another lifetime. That campaign was only six months ago. In that particular example, the prime minister’s enthusiasm for mandatory vaccinations was so profound he front-ran the health advice. The health advice eventually caught up. Given the AHPPC had advised mandatory mask wearing, and the prime minister wasn’t echoing that recommendation, Morrison and the chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly were asked on Wednesday afternoon whether or not the health advice had changed? Kelly said: “The health advice is wear a mask.” So, no, in other words. The health advice had not changed. What’s changed is the politics. Perrottet doesn’t want to impose a mask mandate unless he absolutely has to – and Morrison needs, somehow, to balance the present public health risks with his re-election messaging. Two years into this pandemic, Australians are fatigued. Everyone wants this crisis to be over. People are craving a normal Christmas. Understanding this, Morrison has been warming up for a re-election pitch in the opening months of 2022 which is about getting government out of people’s lives. Pandemic Scott wants to shapeshift into Post Pandemic Personal Responsibility Scott because that’s where he thinks the zeitgeist is – at least the zeitgeist of the people who will determine the outcome of next year’s election. You don’t have to be Einstein to work out Morrison advocating an enforceable mask mandate three days before Christmas doesn’t align with that objective. But in trying to avoid one problem, Morrison is creating another. Morrison is lecturing Australians about taking personal responsibility, while opting out of one of the clear responsibilities of the prime ministerial office – backing in his health advisers at a critical moment with one clear message. Perhaps Morrison will luck out. Perhaps the Omicron variant will be mild enough to facilitate the desired prime ministerial shapeshift. Or perhaps it won’t. It’s one hell of a gauntlet to run. In the coming weeks, we’ll see how it pans out. In the meantime, if you just need simple information about what to do to keep yourself and others safe over the next few days as you race about preparing Christmas (and most of us appreciate facts) – be in no doubt what the expert heath advice is. If you are indoors, in a crowd, wear your mask.",News/Australia news,Pandemic Scott wants to shapeshift into Post Pandemic Personal Responsibility Scott | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/22/pandemic-scott-wants-to-shapeshift-into-post-pandemic-personal-responsibility-scott-because-thats-where-the-pm-thinks-the-zeitgeist-is
12/22/2021,"Sometimes the imagination and skill involved in construction can blow your mind. It’s a privilege to be able to feature two such achievements this month in the news section – the Chapel of Sound in China which looks like a rock dropped from space and a Gingerbread City made to raise money for the UK’s Museum of Architecture. As well as the grand statement designs, we also have thoughtful construction with the individual in mind in the form of a library designed to help you connect with your emotions and a previously unseen installation from Ettore Sottsass, founder of the Memphis movement, designed to give personal space.  For more news on architecture, sustainable living, art, fashion and new ideas, sign up for our monthly newsletter here China is in the middle of a building boom that has made it the largest construction site in human history. With almost half of the world’s building work set to take place in this one country in the coming decade, the architects and builders who shape this skyline are paramount. A new generation of local architects is now replacing western names as the creators of China’s most prestigious buildings. Not only is their fresh vision gaining international recognition but their more sustainable practice is also helping the planet. An exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Reuse, Renew, Recycle: Recent Architecture from China, showcases this generation’s commitment to social and environmental sustainability – featuring work by Pritzker Prize winning Amateur Architecture and Aga Khan Award laureate Zhang Ke and his studio ZAO/Standard. Reinventing Cultural Architecture, a book covering the work of Open Studio, is published this spring. This Beijing-based studio has just completed work on a concert hall called the Chapel of Sound situated in the shadow of the Great Wall. Open Studio strives for harmony with the environment in design and materials used. Its best-known work is the UCCA Dune Art Museum built into a beach in Bohai Bay. The Chapel of Sound is similarly elemental, built like a rock and open to the elements. Open Studio was founded by Li Hu and Huang Wenjing and their comments on their new work seem to sum up the new Chinese ethos: “We are at a time when the question of our relationship with nature as human beings is more acute than ever. Can we be humble enough to hear what nature is murmuring to us? We wanted to create something different, something meaningful.” Today we’re familiar with the idea of a man cave as a place for the male of the species to get some precious alone time. The same concept was present in mid-Century, post-modern Italian design – albeit in a rather more stylish incarnation. In the mid-1960s, the architect, designer and Memphis Group founder Ettore Sottsass built Sala Sottsass, a “room within a room”, in Casa Lana, the Milan home of a typographer friend. Sottsass was intrigued by the relationship between men, their needs and their rituals, and the inhabited space. So Sala Sottsass consisted of a wooden structure with sofas arranged so that they formed a “protected space” to sit, chat and listen to music. The project has never been seen by the public but now the Sottsass Archive has meticulously rebuilt it in Triennale di Milano, the design and art museum in Lombardy. To accompany the installation, the Triennale has organised three exhibitions throughout 2022 that will look deeper into the world of Sottsass. In the meantime, any men shuffling off to the spare room for some peace and quiet this Christmas might like to gaze on this “little piazza… where one can move and meet” as Sottsass himself put it in 1967 – and dream. For more information on the upcoming Sottsass exhibitions, check the Triennale website  Skip Gallery was founded in 2017 by curators and artists Lee Baker and Catherine Borowski in, yes, a skip. “We couldn’t find anywhere to show our work, but Borowski came up with the bright idea of dropping a skip as a gallery into a parking space and our bonkers project was born,” says Baker. For Christmas 2021, Skip Gallery brings you the Feelings Library. This project is a collaboration with architects Caukin Studio and therapy service Self Space. The Library is a strange, slightly forbidding thatched pop-up sanctuary – built in a skip, of course – in Spitalfields market, London. Inside is a cosy reading room where you can learn about emotions from the library shelves of journals provided by Self Space. “This was two years in the making, and we are over the moon to launch Feelings Library. We feel strongly about creating opportunities for artists and designers and showcasing creativity in public spaces.” With mental health problems on the rise during the ongoing Covid pandemic, let’s hope the Feelings Library helps someone to have a happy Christmas. For more information, visit feelingslibrary.com German American Florine Stettheimer was one of the 20th century’s most significant feminist artists. Marcel Duchamp helped stage a retrospective of her work two years after her death in 1944, and Andy Warhol said she was his favourite artist. Stettheimer was celebrated for her poetry, costume design and theatre sets, but perhaps one of her most significant accomplishments was a painting which has been described as the first nude self-portrait from the perspective of the “female gaze”, completed back in 1915. After spending her early years in Europe, she and her sisters, Carrie and Ettie, helped introduce the modernist movement to America and supported the Harlem Renaissance through their Bryant Park salon in New York. The Stetties, as the sisters were known, each had their own creative pursuit. Carrie created a doll-house containing an art collection of miniatures donated by their artist friends. Ettie wrote feminist novels under the pseudonym Henrie Waste. Florine made overtly political artworks long before it was the norm – addressing gender identity, segregation and women’s rights, as well as the burgeoning avant garde scene in her native New York. A new biography by art historian Barbara Bloemink focuses on these more political works and brings new focus to the innovative artist, reminding the world that behind her faux-naive style – so beloved by Warhol – was an intelligent woman, way ahead of her time. Florine Stettheimer, a Biography (Hirmer Publishing/ University of Chicago Press,) is published 24 January Following on from the release of 2020’s gingerbread Ikea furniture, new festive edible design projects have materialised this year. American designer Kelly Wearstler made a limited edition California Modern-style gingerbread house with LA food company Flamingo Estate, with all proceeds going to Create Structure, a charity that helps communities rebuild with sustainable housing after natural disasters. Swedish studio Ulf Mejergren Architects (UMA) decided to see how they could use gingerbread biscuits and created an edible hut out of the festive cookies. Miller beer released a limited edition gingerbread dive bar kit which has sadly now sold out. If you want to admire the very best in biscuit construction, then go to the London Museum of Architecture. They hold an annual exhibition where designers and engineers create a gingerbread metropolis. The show raises money to support the museum’s charity. The Gingerbread City show runs until 9 January 2022 at the Museum of Architecture, 6-7 Motcomb Street, Belgravia, London This year a World Economic Forum report found that the fashion industry supply chain is the third biggest source of pollution on the planet. A big contributor to this is synthetic fibre production which uses fossil fuels. The development of biomaterials to replace these nonrenewable fabrics is a key area of research in fashion and, this month, Algiknit revealed its new kelp-derived yarn and plans to start collaborations with fashion brands in 2022. AlgiKnit has spent four years developing technology to produce yarns using seaweed on a commercial scale. Kelp is renewable, regenerative and can be used to make versatile, durable threads for shoes and clothes which has a much lower carbon footprint than conventional yarn, especially synthetics. “We know consumers want more cost-competitive, environmentally-sound options that perform as well as conventional materials,” said Aaron Nesser, co-founder and chief technology officer of AlgiKnit. “The yarn we’re producing today has the look and feel of natural fibres, plus all the makings of a no-compromise conscious material.”  ",Arts/Art and design,December design news: gingerbread modernism and mid-century man caves,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/22/december-design-news-gingerbread-modernism-and-mid-century-man-caves
12/22/2021,"Despite a global pandemic, inflation being at a decades-high and supply chain issues around the country, Americans are still shopping this holiday season, and not just online. Retail sales have been soaring during the pandemic as stimulus payments, a low unemployment rate and savings from spending less on travel and going out have encouraged Americans to buy more things. In November 2021, Americans spent 18% more than they had in November 2020. Experts predicted that this holiday shopping season will be the highest on record.  The increased spending seen over the last year has revived the presence of bricks-and-mortar stores across the country. Once thought to be dying in the shadow of e-commerce’s massive growth, data from this year has shown that more retailers are opening stores than closing them, according to research and advisory firm IHL Group. The firm found that for every retailer that closed a store in 2019, five more are opening stores in 2021. The data is surprising given the dire outlook for brick-and-mortar stores at the end of 2020, when a record 12,200 stores closed. But many customers still shop in stores: e-commerce makes up just 13% of all retail sales in the US, according to the US Census Bureau, though that number is expected to continue to rise over time. On Black Friday weekend this year, foot traffic in stores was up by a third compared to last year, though it was still 21% below 2019’s levels. Some malls saw lines of people standing outside of store. Experts say that while the role that brick-and-mortar stores play for consumers and retailers is changing, this holiday shopping season is highlighting the fact that they are not obsolete. “The store, the role that it fulfills, is changing,” said Mark Mathews, vice-president of research development and industry analysis at the National Retail Federation. “It’s not just about the transaction.” Less consumers are using brick-and-mortar stores for casual browsing and are instead using it as an extension of their online shopping experience. Curbside pickup, where customers go to stores to pick up a purchase made online, has become popular for customers and is likely to stay, Mathews said. Retailers can now use their stores as fulfillment centers, allowing them to save on shipping and warehouse space. This year specifically has also seen supply chain issues affecting online retailers: American shoppers saw over 2bn out-of-stock messages online in October, according to Adobe Analytics. “Consumers feel like they probably need to go pick it up and have it in hand. A lot of folks are really worried that [their items are] not going to get there in time,” said Rod Sides, a vice-chair at Deloitte and leader of its US retail and distribution practice. For retailers, brick-and-mortar stores also serve as a way to expose customers to their brand. Many retailers have found that their online sales increase in the areas where they have bricks-and-mortar stores set up. When Macy’s announced last month that it will probably delay a batch of closures that it was considering, the company cited the symbiotic relationship between its brick-and-mortar stores and its e-commerce business. “The delayed closure of certain stores allows us to maintain a physical presence in the market, which is critical to our top line growth,” said Macy’s chief financial officer Adrian Mitchell during a call with analysts. “Digital performance is stronger in the markets where we have stores.” Perhaps the strongest sign that bricks-and-mortar stores will stick around is the fact that many online retailers are opening up stores of their own. Amazon is looking to substantially increase its physical footprint, and other major e-commerce retailers are doing the same. Store closures are likely to continue in the US, but Sides notes that the amount of retail square footage per capita far exceeds other countries and has for some time. “We could argue that we were oversaturated,” Sides said, adding that there will probably be an “equilibrium” of online and brick-and-mortar stores that makes sense for retailers and consumers. “You really need to have both.”",News/US news,US holiday shoppers fund a revival for bricks-and-mortar stores,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/us-holiday-shopping-retail-stores
