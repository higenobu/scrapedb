2/9/2022,"Steph Houghton is not in the England squad for the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup that starts next week, after the Manchester City captain aggravated the achilles injury she sustained in September. The 33-year-old defender returned to action in early January but played only five times before being sidelined again and will miss the four-team tournament in which England face Canada, Spain and Germany.  “She is really, really disappointed of course but you need to do smart things too,” said England’s manager, Sarina Wiegman. “If you need more time to get fit you have to take that time, otherwise you’ll be out for a longer period and that’s what we don’t want, what Manchester City doesn’t want and what she doesn’t want.” Houghton picked up an achilles injury during Wiegman’s first game in charge, an 8-0 defeat of North Macedonia last September, and is in a race to prove her fitness for the rigours of a home Euros which kick off on 6 July. “She did well when she came out of the winter break, she played well, but now she needs a bit more time to get fit again,” said Wiegman. “Hopefully she’ll recover in a short while and can build up some playing minutes.” Wiegman has been able to call in Houghton’s clubmates Lucy Bronze and Ellie Roebuck for the first time after both missed the past three camps through injury. Arsenal’s Leah Williamson is also back, having captained the team in Wiegman’s first camp before being injured for November’s matches, but Chelsea’s Beth England is out injured.

So yes, in April, if we think one player has done really, really well and she can be a good player for our squad, then I wouldn’t hesitate to select her.” The Lionesses are getting set for their toughest test before the Euros with friendlies against the Olympic gold medal winners Canada in Middlesbrough on 17 February, a Spain side laden with Barcelona’s European champions in Norwich on 20 September and the eight-times European Champions Germany in Wolverhampton on 23 February. Under Wiegman, England have played six 2023 World Cup qualifiers, scoring 53 times without reply. “This is what we need,” said Wiegman. “We had a very good autumn with these three camps and now we really need these games to know where we are and from there we can continue. This is a tournament where we play world-class opponents and we’ll really know where we stand in our preparations for the Euros.”",Sport/Football,Steph Houghton ‘really disappointed’ to miss out on another England squad,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/steph-houghton-really-disappointed-miss-another-england-women-squad
2/9/2022,"Pfizer has had an exceptionally good pandemic. Today it announced that its Covid-19 vaccine brought in $37bn billion last year, making it easily the most lucrative medicine in any given year in history. That isn’t all. For a company that was until recently the least trusted company in the least trusted industrial sector in the United States, Covid-19 has been a PR coup. Pfizer has become a household name over the last 12 months. The company was toasted on nights out in Tel Aviv, and there are cocktails named after its vaccine in bars across the world. The US president referred to Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, as a “good friend”, and the great man parked his jet next to Boris Johnson’s at last year’s G7 summit in Cornwall.  The global vaccine rollout has created levels of inequality so great that many call it a ‘vaccine apartheid’. Pharmaceutical corporations like Pfizer have led this rollout, setting the terms by which they sell vaccines and deciding who to prioritise. Ultimately, their approach affects who does, and does not, receive vaccines. Right from the start, Pfizer was clear that it wanted to make a lot of money from Covid. The company claims that its vaccine costs just under £5 per dose to produce. Others have suggested it could be much cheaper. Either way, the company is selling doses at a huge profit – the UK government paid £18 a shot for its first order, £22 for its most recent purchase. That means the NHS has paid a mark-up of at least £2bn – six times the cost of the pay rise the government agreed to give nurses last year. It has been claimed that the company initially tried to pitch their medicine to the US government for an eye-popping $100 a dose. Tom Frieden, a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accused the firm of “war profiteering”. Pfizer has sold the vast majority of its doses to the richest countries in the world – a strategy sure to keep its profits high. If you look at its global distribution, Pfizer sells a tiny proportion of its vaccines to low-income countries. By last October, Pfizer had sold a measly 1.3% of its supply to Covax, the international body set up to try to ensure fairer access to vaccines. Pfizer wasn’t selling many doses to poorer countries, but neither would it allow them to produce the life-saving vaccine on their own, through licensing or patent sharing. That’s because, at the root of the Pfizer model, are a set of intellectual property rules, laid down in trade deals. These effectively allow big pharma corporations to operate as monopolies, with no responsibility to share the knowledge they own, however much society needs it. Early on, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised that we would need to scale up production very rapidly – and that individual corporations like Pfizer simply wouldn’t have the necessary capacity. They urged companies to share vaccine recipes, creating a sort of “patent pool” known as CTAP, which would have allowed openness and collaboration. Companies would still have been paid, but they wouldn’t be able to restrict production. This sort of suspension of normal business rules during times of great need was previously common, such as with penicillin during the second world war, or sharing smallpox vaccine knowledge in the 1960s. But in this case, Pfizer’s chief went on the offensive, deriding CTAP as “nonsense” – and saying it was “dangerous” to share companies’ intellectual property. It has been claimed that 100 factories and laboratories around the world could have been making vaccines, but have been unable to do so because they cannot access patents and recipes like those held by Pfizer. Pfizer took a similar line on the new facility that has been set up in South Africa to try to get to grips with mRNA vaccines so that it can share this revolutionary medical technology with the world. Because neither Pfizer nor Moderna will share their knowhow, the scientists have had to start from scratch. News last week suggests that they’re getting there, confounding the pharmaceutical industry’s claims that you couldn’t possibly make such a vaccine in poorer countries. There are many who will argue that while large pharma companies do behave ruthlessly, we must accept it because the service they provide – inventing lifesaving medicines – is so crucial. But this doesn’t hold. Companies like Pfizer behave more like hedge funds, buying up and controlling other firms and intellectual property, rather than traditional medical research companies. The truth is, they aren’t the sole inventors of the vaccine. That was the work of public money, university research and a much smaller company, Germany’s BioNTech. As one former US government official complained, the fact we call it the “Pfizer” vaccine is “the biggest marketing coup in the history of American pharmaceuticals”. A Stat news analysis in 2018 concluded that Pfizer developed only a fraction – about 23% – of its drugs in-house. And a US Government Accountability Office report the previous year noted that the industry model is increasingly to simply buy up smaller firms that have already developed products. This allows them to monopolise that knowledge, and maximise the price of the resulting medicines. Pfizer has channeled $70bn (£52bn) to its shareholders , directly through dividend payments, and through stock-buybacks. This dwarfs its research budget for the same period. To put today’s figures in context, the world’s most lucrative drug in any single year up to this point was Humira, which treats autoimmune diseases, and which generated its owner, AbbVie, $20bn in 2018. Humira was studied by a US congressional committee, and is a classic case of how big pharma companies work today: buy up a drug that’s already been invented, patent it to the hilt, and increase the price 470% over its lifetime. Corporations like Pfizer should never have been put in charge of a global vaccination rollout, because it was inevitable they would make life-and-death decisions based on what’s in the short-term interest of their shareholders. We need to dismantle the monopolies that have handed these financialised beasts such power, and instead invest in a new network of research institutes and medical factories around the world that can actually serve the public.

2/9/2022,"With an almighty clang, Jane Campion has hit that tipping point at which the awards-season groupthink clusters around one particular movie. Her western psychodrama The Power of the Dog leads the tally list with a whopping 12 nominations. It is about a toxically dysfunctional confrontation between a rancher played by Benedict Cumberbatch in 1920s Montana and his sister-in-law, played by Kirsten Dunst, brother played by Jesse Plemons and his brother’s sensitive stepson played by Kodi Smit-McPhee. Clearly, the Academy has responded to the classic quality of The Power of the Dog: the way it speaks to US culture and history and positions itself unambiguously in the heartland, but a heartland coloured and contorted by anger and sadness, rather like Chloé Zhao’s much-garlanded Nomadland did last year. It’s a movie that reminded me more than a little of the work of George Stevens, though with a 21st-century twist. It is interesting that the director comes from outside the US, and so does its leading man: those tokens of Americanness are being imagined and fabricated by outsiders.  Dune, with 10 nominations including best picture, is a film that displays its own “American classic” credentials: it is an eerie, wonderful spectacle orchestrated by Denis Villeneuve (who is not rewarded with a best director nomination) from the iconic Frank Herbert SF novel about a colonial imposition of power on a distant planet due to its fabulous mineral wealth.Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast, inspired by his own childhood in Troubles-era Northern Ireland, comes in fourth position with seven nominations. This film has been subject to the annual tradition of the awards-season columnist backlash, in which pundits take against the consensus around a certain film. The admittedly warm-hearted and gentle quality of Belfast (so different from the accepted mode of angry despair) has been held against it – although I can think of two Belfast-born or Belfast-raised commentators who support this film. My personal theory is that the success of the TV comedy Derry Girls has moved the dial about what’s considered the correct tone for depicting this subject. Steven Spielberg’s glorious West Side Story gets the “bronze medal’” with seven nominations, and perhaps its awards-season gleam will persuade people to see this wonderful movie. Elsewhere, King Richard, with six nominations, is a movie that, although not critically fashionable, has won hearts and minds. This is largely due to the barnstorming performance of Will Smith as Richard Williams, the formidable tennis-coach-slash-dad of the legendary Williams sisters. It is good to see Guillermo del Toro’s amazing noir melodrama Nightmare Alley come up with four nominations (I had feared an almost complete snub). Flee is an outstanding animated documentary about a gay Afghan man who as a child fled his country for Denmark after the 1989 Soviet withdrawal – remarkably, its three nominations span three separate categories in a triumphant style. I was hoping for more Oscar recognition for Paul Thomas Anderson’s staggeringly good comedy Licorice Pizza, but perhaps it is simply too wacky, too uncategorisable, and its age-gap theme too tricky a sell. I found myself disappointed that Lady Gaga’s hilarious turn in House of Gucci was overlooked. (Come to think of it, so was Jared Leto’s florid impersonation of a minor Gucci – probably rightly. But critics are wrong to mock his intentionally camp and absurd performance. I laughed with it, not at it.) Jessica Chastain is rightly nominated for her warmly sympathetic lead as the televangelist diva in The Eyes of Tammy Faye; as is Kristen Stewart for her amusing impersonation of Diana, Princess of Wales in the overrated arthouse-Crown extravaganza Spencer. Olivia Colman may well get her second Oscar for her great turn in The Good Daughter. But Nicole Kidman didn’t do her best work in Being the Ricardos; I would have preferred to see Ruth Negga in there for Passing. Two years ago, Korean director Bong Joon-ho asked filmgoers to consider that subtitles aren’t so much of an obstacle, being only an inch or so high. Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s marvellous Japanese film Drive My Car, an adaptation of a Haruki Murakami story, has had its own very heartening success with four nominations.

2/9/2022,"César Azpilicueta has said the chance to make history will drive him on when Chelsea attempt to win the Club World Cup for the first time. The European champions were beaten finalists on the only other occasion when they qualified and Azpilicueta, who was in the team that lost to Corinthians in 2012, is not short of motivation before Thomas Tuchel’s side look to reach the final on Saturday by beating Al Hilal on Wednesday.  The importance of the occasion is not lost on the 32-year-old defender, who is looking to become the first Chelsea player to win every major trophy at club level, and he knows from bitter experience that it would be a mistake to underestimate the Saudi Arabian champions. “It’s very difficult to be in this tournament and after 10 years you realise how difficult it is,” Azpilicueta said. “We lost against Corinthians and I had a different feeling. It was my first season at Chelsea and maybe it looks easier than it is. And then with time you realise how difficult it is, first of all just qualifying. So we have to make the most of it, starting with tomorrow’s game. Hopefully that bad experience will help. “I’m really motivated. In 2012 it hurt a lot. To win it for the first time for the club is huge, we have to make it everything for us. We know it’s going to be difficult. Maybe sometimes in Europe there’s a different perception of what the tournament is but we’re against champions of other continents. We have a huge motivation.” Azpilicueta, who joined Chelsea from Marseille in 2012, refused to say whether completing his medal collection could convince him to seek a fresh challenge this summer. The Spaniard is out of contract at the end of the season and could join Barcelona but he is not thinking about his future. “That’s not important right now,” he said. “It’s to win the trophy. We’re trying to create our own history.” Chelsea have travelled to Abu Dhabi without Tuchel, who is in quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19 last Friday. The manager could join up with the squad on Friday if he tests negative. Tuchel’s assistants, Zsolt Low and Arno Michels, will lead the team against Al Hilal. Low said that goalkeeper Édouard Mendy could fly to Abu Dhabi on Wednesday after winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal last Sunday. However Kepa Arrizabalaga is expected to start in goal. Reece James is unavailable with a hamstring injury and Mason Mount is a doubt after limping off during Chelsea’s victory over Plymouth Argyle in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday. “Mason is getting better every day,” Low said. “We’ll take the last decision tomorrow.” Al Hilal are managed by Leonardo Jardim, who led Monaco to the Champions League semi-finals in 2017, and could pose problems. They have the former Porto striker Moussa Marega, the former Manchester United forward Odion Ighalo and the former West Brom playmaker Matheus Pereira. However Jardim, whose side reached the last four after thrashing Al Jazira 6-1 last Sunday, believes the tournament’s schedule will give Chelsea a physical advantage. “I’d like to give a warning to Fifa and I find it unfair some teams have to play four matches in eight days and other teams, the best, have to play two matches with their teams rested,” he said. “There should be better care with the match schedule to recover so Asia and South America can have ambition to win this cup.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s Azpilicueta ‘really motivated’ to make history at Club World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/chelsea-cesar-azpilicueta-really-motivated-make-history-club-world-cup-al-hilal
2/9/2022,"Pet hamsters can transmit Covid to humans and are the likely source of a recent outbreak of the Delta variant in Hong Kong, data suggests. The research confirms fears that a pet shop was the source of a recent Covid outbreak in the city, which has seen at least 50 people infected and led to the culling of more than 2,200 hamsters.  However, virologists emphasised that, although the pet trade could provide a route for viral spread, existing pet hamsters are unlikely to pose a threat to their owners and should not be harmed. Many animals are susceptible to catching Covid from humans, but until now, only one – the mink – has proved capable of transmitting it in the opposite direction. Hamsters are particularly vulnerable to the virus – dwarf Roborovski hamsters can die from it – so have been widely used as a model for studying the disease. Concerns that hamsters might also be capable of infecting humans first surfaced when a 23-year-old worker at the Little Boss pet shop in Hong Kong tested positive for Covid on 15 January – the city’s first Delta variant diagnosis for more than three months. A woman who visited the pet shop was also infected, and other members of her family tested positive in the days that followed. In response, public-health officials swabbed hundreds of rodents at the pet shop and at the warehouse supplying it. Viral genetic material or antibodies were detected in 15 of the 28 Syrian hamsters, but in none of the dwarf hamsters, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits or chinchillas tested. None of the hamsters had overt symptoms. After coronavirus was detected in the hamsters, Prof Leo Poon, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues undertook further viral genome sequencing, which revealed that the hamsters were all infected with the Delta variant, and that their viruses were closely related. The nature of the mutations contained within these viruses suggested that transmission had been going on for some time – possibly since mid-November. The hamsters were imported from a supplier in the Netherlands during December and January. Meanwhile, analysis of samples from the pet shop worker and infected customer suggested that their viruses were closely related to the hamster viruses, but that they were unlikely to have transmitted the infection to each other. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, is the first to provide “convincing evidence” that hamsters can become infected in real-life settings, and that they can pass the virus to humans, as well as to other hamsters. “Both genetic and epidemiological results strongly suggest that there were two independent hamster-to-human transmission [events], and that such events can lead to onward human transmission,” Poon said. “Importation of infected hamsters was the most likely source of virus infection.” Most surprisingly, the virus could still “transmit between humans quite effectively” even after replicating in hamsters, Poon told the journal Nature. Although his results point to the global pet trade as a route for viral spread, people are still much more likely to be infected by each other than by their pets, he added. Even so, the findings highlight the possibility that the virus may be spilling over to other animal species without being detected, providing an opportunity for further mutation and potential spillover back to humans. They therefore “highlight the need for awareness, surveillance and for appropriate quarantine and control policies for the pet animal trade”, said Poon.",News/World news,"Hamsters can transmit Covid to humans, data suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/hamsters-can-transmit-covid-to-humans-data-suggests
2/9/2022,"Trevor Noah waded into the controversy surrounding the podcast host Joe Rogan on Monday evening, after the musician India Arie announced she would remove her music from Spotify, which has a lucrative deal with Rogan, because she objected to Rogan’s “language around race”. Arie also published a compilation of Rogan – who was under fire last week for coronavirus misinformation on his podcast, prompting musicians Neil Young and Joni Mitchell to pull their catalogues from Spotify – saying the N-word on his podcast.  “If there’s ever a video of you saying the N-word that many times, you better pray one of two things: either you’re Black person, or you’re a dead man from history,” Noah said on Monday’s Daily Show. On Saturday, Rogan issued a videotaped apology in which he called the compilation “the most regretful and shameful thing that I’ve ever had to talk about publicly” and said his past use of the word would make sense in context. “Maybe you’re a professor teaching history, maybe you’re a news anchor reporting on a story about Joe Rogan, maybe you’re in a Quentin Tarantino movie and you have to use the N-word, because if you don’t, the movie has no dialogue,” said Noah of the context argument. “But for the most part, as a white person, you never need to use the N-word.” “Here’s a life hack for white people: saying the actual N-word puts you in unnecessary trouble, especially if you’re not racist,” he added. “It doesn’t matter the context. Because Black people don’t have the time to sit down and sort out the racist who says the N-word 70 times with the non-racist who says the N-word 70 times. Black people are dealing with too much shit!” “Just stop saying it or just be racist – it’s easier for everyone that way.” Noah also addressed a separate clip in which Rogan described entering a cinema in a Black neighborhood as “we walked into Planet of the Apes. We walked into Africa, dude.” In the apology, Rogan said he “did not, nor would I ever, say that Black people are apes, but it sure fuckin’ sounded like that. “First of all, he said he would never say Black people are apes, but he said that. That’s literally what he said,” Noah responded. “You did say it, which is racist. And it’s not just racist. Let’s be honest – that’s like OG racism. That’s like the original, old-school racism. Like that’s on the Mount Rushmore of racism.” But what Noah found “particularly illuminating” was Rogan’s claim that he wasn’t being racist with the story, just entertaining. “No, Joe, I think you were using racism to be entertaining,” Noah said. “I’m not saying you were trying to offend Black people, by the way, but you knew that offending Black people would get a laugh out of those white friends who you were with.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel reacted to an overdue rebuke of Donald Trump by his former running mate, Mike Pence. “I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election,” Pence told a conference hosted by the conservative Federalist Society in Florida on Friday. “President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election.” “Strong words – ‘President Trump was wrong,’” Kimmel said. “You know he spent all day practicing that in front of a mirror as mother patted him gently on the britches.” Pence also said “there’s no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.” “Well if that isn’t Stella getting her groove back, I don’t know what is,” Kimmel noted. “The vice-poodle has been unleashed. What a weird turn of events. I thought for sure Melania would dump Trump before Mike Pence did.” And in other Trump news, the former president was reportedly “confused” that staff did not enjoy him replaying footage from the January 6 attack on the Capitol. “Good old Captain Bonespurs, he’s always loved watching others do the fighting,” Kimmel mocked. “Can you imagine how spectacularly pathetic you have to be to get pleasure from watching that? He probably made Don Jr and Eric wrestle each other for spaghetti every Friday night.” Now out of office, Trump has been camped out at his Mar-a-Lago resort, which advertised a party this weekend with the former president as disc jockey. “DJ Don!” said Kimmel. “And I want you to imagine now what song this great lover of music might pick to get his guests up and going …” Kimmel’s pick: YMCA, “his inexplicable campaign rally song. The man basically lives in a catering hall. Also, he dances like a Rock ’em Sock ’em robot.”",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah on using the N-word: ‘Just stop saying it or just be racist’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/08/trevor-noah-joe-rogan-n-word

Not The Fiver’s words, reader, but those of Gabrielle, who sounds as though she could be an exciting new signing brought in by Newcastle United during the January transfer window, but is actually a singer made famous in the 90s for her aspirational words of ambition and desire. Much like the now-52-year-old Londoner, it appears that Bruno Guimarães – who sounds like he could be a singer from the 90s but is actually an exciting new signing brought in by Newcastle United during the January transfer window – shares Gabrielle’s penchant for a dream, as well as potentially having the wool well and truly pulled over his eyes. “We’re going to be a big power in world football,” roared the new £33.3m Brazilian midfielder in his first chat with the local press, presumably before he saw fellow Newcastle recruit Matty Targett shuffling around the training pitch like a fan that had won a competition to line up with the first team. “The owners were very up-front that, this season, the idea is to stay in the Premier League but the main objective in the years to come is to be in [Big Cup] and, eventually, to win [Big Cup].” The concept is a nice one. Sure, Newcastle might eventually win [Big Cup], in the same way they eventually win any other cup, or the same way The Fiver might eventually get out of bed. Manchester City, who act as some sort of awful precedent here, having started with the same lofty Big Cup dreams after their own Middle-Eastern revamp in 2008, are yet to get their hands on Ol’ Big Ears, despite 14 years and an estimated £1.5bn of trying. But they might, of course, eventually. So while Guimarães should be admired for his temerity, he could just as much be remembered as this generation’s Roque Santa Cruz, having swallowed the spiel from a Newcastle suit, spending the most important years of his career getting the ball off Paul Dummett and walloping missiles into ‘The Channel’ for Chris Wood to chase. Still, Bruno, you really should give Gabrielle a listen. The years will just fly by! “They have to be streetwise. It is a league we are playing in where there are a lot of streetwise players … I don’t think we have been coaching being streetwise, but I think it is something they will all learn.

He did, of course, forget to include ‘but not with me in charge and a defensive midfield of McTominay and Fred’” – Noble Francis. “I really don’t think your 10 FA Cup talking points went far enough (yesterday’s Still Want More?). Antonio Conte had a nerve even stepping foot on the same hallowed patch of turf as York City’s most relentlessly adequate full-back, and Spurs showed a lack of respect by blatantly scoring two more goals than Brighton at the weekend. If the FA Cup isn’t for Graham Potter’s team, then it should – as many have been quietly saying – be smelted down into some pleasant jewellery and dispersed among loyal Brighton support to compensate them, if in part only, for the continued injustices of 1996.

2/9/2022,"Television quiz masters have the great advantage of the answers being written on cards. Some like to give the impression that they would know more than the contestants regardless of those prompts. Bamber Gascoigne, who has died aged 87, almost certainly did. There were many sweet moments on University Challenge, which he fronted for its first 25 years from 1962, when Gascoigne would, for example, absent-mindedly sing a line of a Bach cantata to confirm a response, or quote the whole couplet or paragraph from which an answering phrase came.  Gascoigne was naturally literate and intellectual, as he showed in his other major TV work – the historical documentary series The Christians (1977), Victorian Values (1987) and The Great Moghuls (1990). His genuine erudition drove a business sideline in high-end publishing and bookselling. This allowed him to choose TV work carefully but also led to a second quiz show, in which, improbably as it might seem in a contemporary medium cautious about high culture, he went somewhat upmarket from University Challenge, fronting Connoisseur (BBC Two, 1988-89), a panel game in which the subject matter was exclusively the fine arts. His learning, though, was worn lightly and smilingly. Whereas his successor as University Challenge question master (from its revival in 1994), Jeremy Paxman, has the air of a vice-chancellor dropping in to quiz some of the brighter students over dinner, Gascoigne, who was only 27 when appointed, began with, and kept into middle age, the manner of a PhD student or junior lecturer. Although he always wore a jacket (often tweedy) and tie, it would not have been startling if he had turned up with a varsity scarf coiled round his neck. Gascoigne’s ability to speak with great clarity at high speed helped to build tension as the clock ticked. And catchphrases are as important on quiz shows as in comedy: his “Your starter for 10” (announcing the points coming into play) became as famous as “I’ve started, so I’ll finish” on the rival Mastermind, while Gascoigne’s other go-to quote, “I’m sorry I’ll have to hurry you,” charmingly applied his natural good manners to a timed format. The son of a lieutenant colonel and grandson of a brigadier general, Gascoigne was born in London and educated at Eton and Cambridge (“Magdalene, English Literature” would have been his tag if competing on University Challenge). Through student theatre at Cambridge he met Michael Frayn, a lifelong friend, who went on to become a comic playwright and novelist, although it was Gascoigne who had the earliest success as a writer. He scripted Share My Lettuce, a revue for young actors including Maggie Smith and Kenneth Williams, which ran in London from 1957-58, giving Gascoigne a West End success in his early 20s. Switching from vegetable to fruit-related titles, Gascoigne script-edited Dig This Rhubarb, a TV sketch show, but, by then, had already moved from postgraduate comedy to interrogating students. Gascoigne’s accent – and the Oxbridge colleges who dominated University Challenge’s early decades – gave the show a very English feel, despite its American roots in a show called College Bowl, which the Bernstein family, who ran Granada TV, wanted to emulate for UK television. The subject matter – and title – might have been thought potentially intimidating to audiences, but the Bernsteins specifically intended Granada to be a BBC within the ITV commercial structure, and there was no panic over hard questions on the kind of tough subjects that Gascoigne knew so well. He was the perfect host to prove ITV’s instinct that viewer enjoyment does not necessarily depend on the ability to play along at home. Instead, his easy intellect and unpreposessing grasp of trivia allowed viewers to enjoy the cleverness of others. As a smug arty teenager, I was at first bemused that my working-class north-eastern grandparents (who left school in their early teens) dutifully watched a programme on which they got even fewer of the answers than I did. Now, I ashamedly realise they were appreciating the spectacle of Gascoigne and his contestants’ intelligence (in whom they also saw their children, the first in the family to go to college) and further educating themselves. Whatever your knowledge bank, it was greater by the end of an episode. Gascoigne was also intensely telegenic, if in a slightly eccentric way. His repertoire of encouraging or consolatory smiles or grimaces, nods and head anglings were relished by Griff Rhys Jones – who played ‘Bambi’ Gascoigne in a 1984 episode of The Young Ones – and Mark Gatiss, whose portrayal in the 2006 college comedy movie Starter For Ten introduced Bamber to generations for whom the surname was most associated with the footballer, Paul. The presenter’s unassuming charisma was a good fit for a quiz show that was visual in multiple ways, with its trompe-l’œil (a word which was more than once a starter round answer) effect of the teams sitting on top of each other (in reality, they were side by side on the studio floor). The appearances of the competitors allowed younger viewers (at least white and middle-class ones) to see people on TV who unusually looked like them – while parents and grandparents could jeer about the need to visit a barber or clothes shop. A consequence of Gascoigne’s grand lineage was that, in 2014, he inherited, on the death of a distant aunt, a 15th-century medieval manor in Surrey. He and his wife, Christine, set up the West Horsley Place Trust to restore and maintain the property. Gascoigne’s contribution to television was extended indirectly when his residence was used to film TV shows, including Ghosts and Enola Holmes.",Arts/Television & radio,‘His learning was worn lightly and smilingly’: Mark Lawson pays tribute to Bamber Gascoigne,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/08/his-learning-was-worn-lightly-and-smilingly-mark-lawson-pays-tribute-to-bamber-gascoigne
2/9/2022,"Former foreign minister Alexander Downer privately boasted that Timor-Leste was an “open book” to the Australian government in the year 2000, well before the infamous bugging scandal revealed by Witness K, a tribunal has heard. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal is hearing an application by independent senator Rex Patrick, who is seeking the release of previously secret cabinet documents about Australia’s dealings with Timor-Leste following its 1999 independence vote.  As part of the case, Philip Dorling, a then foreign affairs department officer and adviser to shadow foreign affairs minister Laurie Brereton, has given evidence of a private conversation with Downer on 31 August 2000 during an RAAF flight from Dili to Maroochydore. Dorling recalls Downer speaking of the second world war, describing Winston Churchill’s mistakes and suggesting the war “could have been brought to a more rapid and victorious conclusion” if he had been in Churchill’s position. According to Dorling, Downer spoke of the importance of signals intelligence to the allied war effort and remarked that “clandestine intelligence gathering” remained vital for diplomacy. He then recalls Downer saying: “You know. There’s not much back there [in Dili] we don’t know. We know what they’re saying about Laurie. They’re an open book to us.” Dorling, who went on to become a journalist and now works in Patrick’s office, made a contemporaneous handwritten note about the conversation, which has also been filed to the tribunal. He told the tribunal he had heard concerns from Timorese leaders José Ramos-Horta and Joao Carrascalao prior to his conversation with Downer. Dorling said they had expressed concerns that they were the subject of an extensive electronic surveillance campaign, mounted by Australia. “I interpreted Mr Downer’s remarks, in the context of a discussion of the value of signals intelligence to diplomatic operations, as a measure of confirmation of the concerns expressed by Mr Ramos-Horta and Mr Carrascalao,” Dorling told the tribunal. At the time, Timor-Leste was not yet formally an independent nation. It was being governed by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor after a successful independence ballot in 1999. Downer told Guardian Australia he had no recollection of any conversation with Dorling 22 years ago. But he said it was “particularly thick” for people to think Australia would send thousands of peacekeeping troops to Timor-Leste without learning as much as possible about the environment into which they were being deployed. “What I do recall is we had thousands of troops in East Timor at that time and obviously we did our best to understand the environment in that country,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Your questions are just extraordinary and there must be something in the water in Australia that makes it hard for some people to understand why, when you deploy thousands of troops to a neighbouring country, you need to have extensive information on that country.” Patrick is seeking two archived documents, dated 29 August 2000 and 4 September 2000, which were not released under the usual 20-year rule due to fears they would compromise relations with a current government. He has already secured the release of parts of the documents which show the Australian cabinet in 2000 was preoccupied with the interests of big oil and gas corporations, fearing the independence of Timor-Leste could disrupt access to the vast underwater reserves in the Timor Sea. During subsequent negotiations in 2004 over the Timor Sea maritime boundary, Australia infamously bugged the government offices of Timor-Leste to gain an upper hand. That operation was exposed by intelligence officer Witness K and his lawyer Bernard Collaery, who were charged for their actions in 2018. Collaery is still awaiting trial. Patrick said the evidence suggested Australia had been spying on Timor-Leste “from the moment they became independent”. He said Timor was a “young, fragile, inexperienced country that was desperate for oil and gas revenues” to lift itself out of poverty. “They needed a friend to help them build their new nation,” he said.  “And what did we do? We spied on them to gain an advantage for oil and gas companies, to steal their resources. “I’m a former submariner. I know the intelligence game. I’ve never come across intelligence being collected and used for commercial purposes. I’ve never seen an intelligence product being used to defraud a friend.” Xanana Gusmão, a former president of Timor-Leste, has also given evidence in support of Patrick’s attempts to secure the cabinet records. Gusmão said the release of the documents would “be a positive outcome” for relations between Australia and Timor-Leste. “Any continued secrecy relating to those events only serves to create a further sense of suspicion and impropriety between neighbours,” he said. He said evidence showing the spy mission took place was already on the public record and Timor-Leste generally believed the claims to be true. Gusmão recalled a UN diplomat Sergio Di Mello telling him in 1999 or 2000: “Whisper what you have to say, otherwise Australia will hear our conversation.” The case continues before the AAT.",News/Australia news,"Alexander Downer called Timor-Leste an ‘open book’ for Australia in 2000, tribunal hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/alexander-downer-called-timor-leste-an-open-book-for-australia-in-2000-tribunal-hears
2/9/2022,"Michelle Brasier has a knack for making sad things very funny. Her last musical comedy show, Average Bear, was about living in the shadow of hereditary illness – a family history of cancer means that Brasier has a 97% chance of developing the disease that claimed the lives of her father and brother. The show hit the right notes, snagging Brasier the director’s choice award at the Sydney comedy festival. Brasier will bring Average Bear to the Adelaide fringe, Perth comedy festival and Brisbane comedy festival this year for another round of shows. She’ll also present her new show, a theatrical hour of storytelling and music titled Reform, at the Melbourne international comedy festival and Sydney comedy festival this April and May. Reform is the cautionary tale of an online scam and a little less close to the bone.  Her history of loss has left Brasier with a conflicted relationship to physical objects. Here, she tells us why she is afraid of holding on to sentimental items, as well as the story of a few significant personal belongings. I’d save my late dog Bruce’s collar. It has a bow tie so people knew he was friendly. It still smells like him, which is to say it smells like chemo and staffy farts, but I like it. I keep it out sometimes, much to the discomfort of guests and our other dog, Eva, whose farts are treated with far less reverence. I was in a fire once and, in a daze, grabbed only my DVD boxset of early 00s cult hit Veronica Mars. So maybe I’d grab that again? Fight or flight is a funny old thing. I try very hard to not get attached to physical things because I am afraid of losing them. Anything sentimental – jewellery from my family, old photos, heartfelt letters – I hate having, because I know I might lose them. So I try to let go of things on my own terms. I’d rather recycle a beautiful letter the second I get it than lose it in a move. I’ve lost a few people in my life and that makes it even worse – you just want to hold on to every scrap of them. “He sneezed on this once”, “this was a candle she lit two times”: pop it in the shrine! It’s a terrible impulse. I should really be a Buddhist but my ego is a nightmare, so here we are. My bath. I love a bath. In the second lockdown I was so desperate for a bath that I went to Bunnings and bought the biggest storage tub I could find. I popped it in the shower to fill it up and bathed in it. It’s clear plastic, a tight squeeze and humiliating to squish one’s flesh up against. Hard to empty. This year I moved to a place with a real bath. My partner bought me a little wooden bath tray that sits across it, for holding whisky and my iPad. I can use it for watching Desperate Housewives in, writing in, crying in, relaxing with candles, washing the dog, warming up in winter. It ticks all the boxes. Best thing in the world. A place of stillness constructed out of forgivingly opaque porcelain. There are two great regrets in my life. One is sweet and one is embarrassing. The first is that I lost the videotapes I made during my teens. I filmed everything my friends and I did in a cool arty way that felt like Skins or Euphoria at the time, but I’m sure was mostly Bardot dance routines. I filmed the first night I drank alcohol (Fruity Lexia) with friends at a terrible school musical afterparty. That night I figured out I was bi and heard Led Zeppelin for the first time. I delivered a passionate secret monologue to camera about these discoveries. I wish I could watch it now. I love a good cringe in flares and skate shoes. I think I taped over it with an episode of South Park or a Melbourne comedy festival gala for Oxfam. Secondly, I lost a trombone. A full trombone. Not on a flight, not even in an airport. Just day to day moving about my life somehow I misplaced and never found a full trombone. I wish there was more to this story.

2/9/2022,"News Corp Australia has teamed up with its former foe, Google Australia, to establish the Digital News Academy to send hundreds of journalists to a university business school for training in “unashamedly commercial journalism”. Murdoch’s corporate affairs executive Campbell Reid will be the inaugural head of the Digital News Academy (DNA) and News Corp big name writers Joe Hildebrand, Hedley Thomas and Sharri Markson will be on tap for students as “experts”.  More than 250 journalists from News as well as Australian Community Media and some smaller media, will do the nine-month course each year through University of Melbourne’s business school, a move which has angered journalism academics at the Victorian university. The director of the Centre for Advancing Journalism at the University of Melbourne, Andrew Dodd, said the first he heard of the move was when he read the press release. “Our concern is that the training is happening through the business school,” Dodd told Guardian Australia. “And that News Corp is seeking to work with the business school so as to avoid the kind of questioning culture of liberal arts and humanities faculties. It’s a reflection really of the antagonism that News Corp has had for university journalism programs over many years.” Reid told Guardian Australia the business school was chosen “because it’s unashamedly about the business of journalism” and they wanted to design a curriculum from the ground up. Reid said the academy would teach students to do journalism which was “fit for a commercial purpose right from the moment of creation” because the public was prepared to pay for “trusted news sources” through subscriptions. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Times had changed and journalists now needed to be aware of how to reach the target audience for a podcast or a piece of data journalism, he said. News Corp Australasia’s executive chairman Michael Miller said the academy would build a stronger Australia “by keeping society informed through strong and fearless news reporting and advocacy”. “The academy will play a role in equipping news media organisations and news professionals – from on the ground reporters to editors and publishers – with the toolkit, skillset and mindset to meet the opportunities that digital media provides,” Miller said. It was only 12 months ago that Google signed a multi-year deal with News Corp that led to the search engine paying for journalism from news sites around the world. The deal followed years of Murdoch interests blaming the search engine for killing the business model of newspapers. The idea for the school was launched during negotiations for the news media bargaining code between News executives and Google Australia’s managing director Melanie Silva. The dean of Melbourne Business School, Ian Harper, declined an interview but said the academy was a “profound education initiative”. “We believe the Digital News Academy has the potential to transform the future of organisational learning, as well as journalism,” Harper said. Reid said the school would attempt to replace the institutional knowledge of newsrooms lost over many years of attrition. “Not that long ago an entry-level journalist would be surrounded by people who would be both curmudgeons and generous with their time and expertise,” he said. “But the throbbing heart of a newsroom is not as vibrant as it used to be.” Reid acknowledges the tension between News and journalism schools which Dodd believes is behind the move, but he said the business school was not chosen for this reason. “There’s no doubt that at News over time there has been tension or scepticism about some of the journalism schools, and I must say extraordinary scepticism in the journalism schools about News Corporation,” he says. Honorary principal fellow at the Centre for Advancing Journalism, Meg Simons, said it was “incomprehensible” that the university “has apparently entered into this arrangement without consulting its journalism school”. “You can’t teach the technical skills divorced from all the rest of journalism,” Simons said. “Journalism happens within a context, a social and an economic context.” Professor of journalism at New York University Jay Rosen went even further, saying that in the US they don’t put business schools in charge of journalism training, “just as we don’t house dramatic writing courses, or a master’s degree in film-making there”. “It says it wants to train the next generation of journalists in how to tell the story of Australian communities,” Rosen said. “It was my impression that the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Advancing Journalism did that work, but they seem to have been cut out of the deal. I would expect that from the Murdoch companies. I would not expect Australian journalists and academics to go along with it.” Reid said Google’s financial support for the school was not part of the news media bargaining code deal.",News/Media,Anger after News Corp and Google Australia set up journalism academy at university business school,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/09/anger-after-news-corp-and-google-australia-set-up-journalism-academy-at-university-business-school
2/9/2022,"The Coalition has been sitting on a major report into the state of the care workforce in Australia since September last year, and is refusing to make the report public. The National Skills Commissioner Adam Boyton was tasked by prime minister Scott Morrison in March 2021 to undertake an “in-depth study on the factors affecting the supply and demand of care workers”.  The report set out to examine the needs of the care and support workforce for aged, disability, veteran and mental health care looking at “near term” and longer-term needs to 2050. Submissions closed in the middle of last year and the report was delivered to the employment minister, Stuart Robert, in September. The government is yet to formally respond, however Morrison told the National Press Club last week that the government was developing an aged care workforce strategy that would “address our plans to support the aged care workforce”. “We’ll have more to say about that, and I can assure you our plans will be costed, our plans will be funded and we’ll know how they work,” he said. A spokesperson for the National Skills Commission confirmed the report had been delivered to the minister and was “currently under consideration by government”. A spokesperson for Robert said the government was “utilising the study in policy development, particularly in the context of the broader workforce in Australia”. The Health Services Union secretary, Gerard Hayes, called for the report to be made public saying “the government can’t keep hiding its negligence on wages and training”. “This government has no intention to invest in the skills and training of our care workforce. It has ignored repeated warnings, including from the royal commission,” he said. “The Covid crisis has shown just how important training and skill development is, but the government is stubborn and lazy.“Fully funded and supported training opportunities, linked to improved wages, are critical to addressing the current and longer-term workforce pressures for aged care.”The HSU is understood to have made a submission to the National Skills Commission inquiry, arguing that wage increases were needed to reflect the arduous nature of the work in the sector. It also called for workers to have more secure employment arrangements, and better opportunities for career progression. Carolyn Smith, United Workers Union national aged care director, said that the government needed to prioritise change for the workforce. “The government has done 22 inquiries into the problems in aged care since 2013 when they came into government, and this particular workforce inquiry the prime minister commissioned two months after receiving the royal commission report which gave very clear recommendations about what needs to happen in terms of workforce,” Smith said. “Workers are sick of inquiries – they want to see some action to change aged care.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to the study’s terms of reference, the skills commissioner would have regard to the findings of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, and evidence given to the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability. It would assess the likely future growth in demand for workers in the care sector and the “extent to which it can be met over the near and longer term”. “This should include consideration of current strategies to meet that need including workforce planning, migration settings and linkages to the education and training sectors and employment programs and services [and] draw on domestic and international policies and experience, where appropriate.” The report would also develop a framework to monitor and assess pressures in the care and support sector workforce over the short, medium and long term. The criticism from unions comes after the federal government announced on Monday that it would send Australian Defence Force personnel into aged care homes, with up to 1,700 people being deployed to “help stabilise outbreaks and support staff shortages”.Nurses from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation joined protesters in Canberra on Tuesday, with the federal secretary, Annie Butler, saying workers were “fed up with this government for abandoning aged care workers and residents”. In question time on Tuesday, Morrison came under fire from Labor for the government’s handling of the aged care crisis, with the opposition leader accusing the prime minister of “always taking action which is too little too late and after a problem becomes a crisis”.",News/Australia news,"Coalition ‘hiding negligence’ by refusing to release findings of 2021 study into care workforce, union says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/coalition-hiding-negligence-by-refusing-to-release-findings-of-2021-study-into-care-workforce-union-says
2/9/2022,"“You are a hero.” “Not really. The strength just comes to you.”  Her clear voice sounds like she’s next door, but we aren’t even on the same continent, forced to undergo the same sombre routine of countless others around the world: swapping sadness via WhatsApp. Last week, her dad died. By the time I call, he has been cremated. In a pandemic, everything demands a shortcut, even the time-honoured rituals of grieving. We have known each other since we were mere children discussing the length of our dress and hair, although the nuns who taught us brooked no latitude with either. Growing up in India, we lived in a university “compound” in houses reserved for faculty from every department from history to chemistry. It only struck me years later what a rich start it was to be steeped in that environment. We went to the sole functional girls’ school and our brothers to its counterpart: this lack of choice would be the making of us and the foundation of friendship. Our fathers were professors and the heads of their departments. Indian families can be nosy about other people’s children, but when I entered medicine, her family took an honest delight in my achievements. Every holiday, they hosted a special dinner for me. This was slightly embarrassing for a medical student with little real knowledge, but my reservations melted at the sight of the feast. I wanted to earn their pride and hoped one day to repay their goodwill. As a doctor, I field all kinds of worried calls from friends and friends of friends. It can be perilous to say too much without knowing enough, so I stick to suggesting practical questions to ask their own doctor to best understand their situation. Empowering patients thus seems to be the most appropriate use of my skills. But the most frustrating part about my friend’s situation was that her father’s illness knew no cure. All one could do was watch the progressive decline that is the hallmark of dementia. Those who care for relatives with dementia often describe how a loved one slowly slips away, physically intact but unrecognisable bit by bit by bit. At the peak of his powers, her dad was a respectable academic and, like so many people of his era, not only an expert in his own field but also a man interested in the world. On any given evening he might be found arguing about politics, grocery prices and university governance. In between he was grading papers, advising students, guiding his own children, and walking daily. The beginning of the end came when he got lost in the teeming metropolis. Before then, his memory failing, he would still take walks which kept his body fit and his mood stable. His daughter had surreptitiously warned the doorman to keep an eye on him, but it wasn’t really needed because he always came back. Until the day he didn’t. For hours she trusted him to return. Then in a panic she called the police, all the while fearing that he had walked into the traffic. But when found, he had endearingly made himself part of some committee meeting on nearby grounds – a hark back to his university days. My friend is a pragmatist. Determined not to lose him again, she labelled all his clothes and slipped identity tags into his pockets. It seemed dispiriting but if it kept him safe – so be it. To those who look on from the outside, it is impossible to imagine the emotional toll of such caregiving with no end date, but in all those years, I never once heard her protest, such was her filial devotion. Dementia places many indignities on sufferer and carer. On the wards, I encounter adult children who can’t bear to see their declining parents soil themselves, while others are distressed by their labile temperament. Some are amazed by the apathy while others dread the disinhibition. What broke my friend was a visit to the bank. Trying to sort out important financial details, she alarmingly discovered that her father could no longer sign his name. The bank politely suggested an alternative. Thumbprints have been used in India since time immemorial by illiterate or semi-literate people who find it difficult to develop a unique written signature and who may use a thumb impression on official documents to maintain consistency. In fact, “angootha chhap”, meaning thumbprint, is a derogatory Hindi phrase for an illiterate person. While he may not have registered the indignity of the situation, his daughter felt it keenly, and for the first time wondered how much longer he must endure it. Perhaps he thought the same, for he died not long afterwards. Absent the pandemic, I might have had a chance to visit him and pay him my respects. Even if he didn’t recognise me, it could have been a form of closure. More importantly, I could have supported my friend through more than text messages. Amid all her responsibilities, she still asks me how I am doing on the frontline. I tell her that her frontline duty has been longer, harder, and deeply personal. With one parent gone, she continues to care unstintingly for the other. There is no recognition and no respite. There are no awards for the selflessness of these everyday heroes. Quiet and industrious, they are an example to us all, which is why we must shine a light on them while reflecting on the debt of gratitude that society owes them.",Opinion/Opinion,"Bit by bit, dementia made him slip away.

2/9/2022,"Families separated by Australia’s strict travel restrictions are counting down the days to long-anticipated reunions when the country’s border opens after almost two years. On Monday, Scott Morrison announced all double-vaccinated visa holders, including tourists, would be able to enter Australia from 21 February, a decision branded “bittersweet” by those who had been subject to ongoing restrictions.  The border rules have been progressively relaxed since November but some groups – including those on bridging visas, some immediate family members, and tourists – remained cut off from exemption-free travel. Sophie Raynor cheered on the news from Timor-Leste, where she has been living with her partner, Felix Maia, in Dili. Raynor endured almost a year of a long-distance relationship during the pandemic until she was able to leave the country in November. Now, when she returns to Melbourne in a fortnight, her partner, a Timor-Leste citizen, will be able to visit her. “I would have had to go back to Timor-Leste to visit him again in June, so the good news is he can come to Australia instead,” she said. “I hope this reopening is a line in the sand and the end of enforced long-distance and the end of us wondering when we’ll next be able to see each other.” The announcement has also been a welcome relief for those on bridging visas like Canberra-based Shorya Prashar. While most temporary visa holders were granted a reprieve from the hard border in recent months, bridging visa holders have been excluded from the changes until now, leaving them trapped either in or out of the country. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prashar, a restaurant manager, has not seen his family in India since the pandemic began and grew increasingly frustrated as the Morrison government allowed almost every other group – including working holiday makers and international students – to come and go from Australia. “We felt like we were left behind first and were just waiting but with no hope ahead,” he told the Guardian. “But with this news I can see a big smile on my four-year-old kid [because] he can finally see his grandparents back in India and come back to cherish his life in Australia too.” Another person who has a bridging visa, who asked not to be named, has been stuck in Nepal since June because of the ongoing restrictions. The woman has worked and studied in Adelaide for four years and has been desperate to come back to Australia to continue her career. She told Guardian Australia she was “elated” about the reopening. But she warned there were others who continued to face uncertainty, including those whose visas had expired while they were stuck abroad during the pandemic. “It is definitely a relief for me,” she said. “[But] there are lots of people whose visas have expired including bridging visas, 476 [visas] and so on and [they are] uncertain regarding the government’s plan for them.” For Yohana Belinda, the reopening of the border will mark an end to logistical nightmares. Belinda was living in Melbourne prior to the pandemic while completing her university degree. When Australia began to ban international arrivals, she decided to make a quick trip home to Indonesia. Two years later, she still hasn’t been able to return to clean up her apartment, where all her possessions remain. “I haven’t been able to pack up my stuff since the first lockdown,” she said. “I can’t imagine what it’s going to look like. Can you imagine if you haven’t cleaned your bedroom for two years?” Others, like Matthew Hiscox, hope the easing of border restrictions will see the end of snap flight cancellations as the airline industry bounces back to pre-pandemic levels. Hiscox and his partner had flights booked to South America through Latin American Airlines and Qantas to visit family next month. On Friday, the flights were cancelled with no explanation from LATAM. The airline has since cancelled all of its flights out of Sydney for the entirety of March. “All flights are subject to changes due to availability and the current situation and also, some flights are subject to the government approval,” LATAM said on social media. Last year, LATAM suspended all flights from Santiago to Sydney and Auckland until 28 February due to “commercial requirements”. “It’s now been three years since my partner has seen her family back in Colombia and I’ve yet to meet them for the first time,” Hiscox said. “She is incredibly desperate to get home and seeing her face when I got home from work on Friday pretty much reduced me to tears. “I remain hopeful things will be sorted,” he said. “My partner is very upset, but I have promised to get her there [in] any way possible.”",News/Australia news,International borders reopening: Australian visa holders make plans to reunite with loved ones,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/international-borders-reopening-australian-visa-holders-make-plans-to-reunite-with-loved-ones
2/9/2022,"When Nick Howson ends his nursing shift at western Sydney’s Cumberland hospital, it can sometimes be a gamble to make the one-hour drive home before his car runs out of fuel. “You’re always doing that stupid thing where you stretch it – can I drive while the [fuel] lights are blinking for another day?” Howson says. “There’s always a bit of a joke at work when you’re coming up towards payday, and everybody checks their balance to see who’s got the lowest. I continuously win that one.”  The 36-year-old father of two toddlers earns about $39.65 an hour, or roughly the national median salary for permanent male employees. Despite serving in a healthcare industry that’s been stretched to breaking point, Howson’s wages aren’t keeping up with inflation, including petrol prices which shot up a third last year. “There’s this entire sector that has kept the rest of the state functioning for two years,” he says. “We’ve literally given our blood, sweat and tears and we just get nothing – nothing except more angst and to be told to deal with it.” The economy is supposedly heading towards its lowest unemployment rate since 1974 if the joblessness rate drops below 4% as expected by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the second half of 2022. But if the past decade is any guide, a tighter labour market is no guarantee of higher incomes for workers like Howson whose 2.5% wage rise fell short of inflation. The disconnect is a problem the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, recognises as he mulls how long to wait for wage growth to quicken so it at least outpaces prices before he and the central bank’s board start to lift the official cash rate from its record low 0.1%. “[T]he pickup in aggregate wages growth is likely to be only gradual, reflecting slow growth in public sector wages and the inertia resulting from multi-year enterprise agreements,” the RBA said in its quarter monetary policy statement released last Friday. “Most employers in the bank’s liaison program are not anticipating wages growth to move beyond the 2 to 3% range this year [while CPI is forecast at 3.25%].” The December quarter wage price index is not due out until 23 February. In the September quarter, private wages were up 2.4% from a year earlier but those in the public sector “remained subdued at 1.7%, as public sector wages policies continued to weigh on outcomes”, the RBA said. That a falling jobless rate isn’t automatically translating into higher wages is no surprise to Jim Stanford, the director of the Centre for Future Work, who says that hasn’t been the case since about 2013. In a recent paper, Stanford argued the jobless rate itself is a poor guide to the tightness of the labour market. The ABS counted 574,400 as unemployed in December but if you count the 1 million people who want to work more hours than they did and those “marginally attached” workers who would like to work but are not actively seeking it, the actual tally swells to more like 2.5 million, he said. That larger pool is one reason why the so-called Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU), below which wage growth is meant to accelerate, has been overestimated. Once it was thought to be 7%, then 6%, then 5% and now sub-4%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “That magical point, when workers will finally get their share is always just around the corner,” he says, adding the idea wages are set by demand and supply and productivity is “absolutely bankrupt”. “There is no reason to believe that there’s any magical unemployment rate at which workers will automatically be paid according to the productivity because wages are not determined by supply and demand,” Stanford says. “They’re determined by power.” Evidence of that power imbalance abound. For instance, Stanford calculates that labour productivity has grown by about one-third since 2000 but wage rises have been only half as much. One contributor to the weakening power of workers has been the drop in collective bargaining, particularly in the private sector, after 2013. “The number of current enterprise agreements registered under the federal industrial relations system fell by more than half between end-2012 and 2021, from 23,500 agreements to 10,000,” Stanford says. “And the number of workers covered by current agreements also plunged by one-third in the same period, from over 2.5 million to 1.6 million,” he says. “The decline was more severe in the private sector.” Stanford blames the rise of insecure work – such as the gig economy – and policies that push for wage restraint for breaking the link between a low jobless rate and higher income for workers. However, Andrew McKellar, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry representing businesses, backs the existing arrangements. “These policy settings reduce the volatility in the wages system and ensure sustainable wages growth that benefits all parties,” McKellar says. “It is too early to tell if the relationship between wages growth and the jobless rate has been disrupted by the pandemic, or that we will see more significant wages pressure in the coming months.” Nor are recovering businesses in a state to fork big pay rises.

Howson’s union, the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association, has begun voting on whether to strike on 15 February. Last year the union sought a 4.75% pay rise and got 2.5%, with about one-fifth of that from an increase in superannuation. Next year’s award increase is still to be set. “Clearly, going backwards is where the wages policy is taking us, and there’s no recognition of what the extra efforts every single member in the public health system has made,” said Brett Holmes, the union’s general secretary. Other unions are also lining up, such as teachers. In New South Wales, their wages agreement expired at the end of 2021 and the NSW Teachers Federation will decide on 19 February whether to ramp strike action. The president of the teachers’ union, Angelo Gavrielatos, says the government’s proposed 2.04% a year increase is “well below current inflation rates”. The Guardian approached the NSW government for comment. The wages issue could also feature prominently at the federal election. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said both Treasury and the RBA had upgraded their wages forecasts as economic activity rebounds faster than expected. “We are already seeing the benefits of the tight labour market with a record number of people taking up new opportunities,” Frydenberg said. “Treasury analysis shows that on average, people switching jobs have seen pay increases of 8% to 10%, well above the rate of inflation.” However, his Labor counterpart, Jim Chalmers said families were “finding it really tough at the moment” as the cost of essentials skyrockets. “The usual relationship between lower unemployment and higher wages growth has been strained, if not broken, because we’ve got all this job insecurity,” Chalmers said.",News/Australia news,‘We just get nothing’: why Australia’s falling jobless rate isn’t translating into higher pay,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/we-just-get-nothing-why-australias-falling-jobless-rate-isnt-translating-into-higher-pay
2/9/2022,"Australian consumers could still be waiting months for international parcel deliveries, despite the addition of thousands of tons of air freight capacity after the country’s long awaited border reopening on 21 February. When Australia opens its international borders, not all destinations will initially have enough passenger demand to support the resumption of freight-carrying passenger flights to Australia to pre-pandemic rates, meaning the delays will continue, Cargo Facts Consulting managing director, Frederic Horst says.  A backlog in the supply chain is currently contributing to delays and continued demand is keeping air freight costs high. While companies importing and exporting goods use cargo freighter planes for international shipments, postal services largely rely on freight holds in the belly of passenger planes – which saw the US Postal Service suspend deliveries to Australia during the harshest months of flight arrival caps and reduced services in 2021. Countries with strict Covid quarantine rules, such as China and Hong Kong, are unlikely to appeal to Australian tourists, meaning airlines will not have a reason to run additional passenger services, Horst said, so Australians are still facing months-long waits for consumer goods and parcels from Asia. But Horst was optimistic that postage delivery times from the United Kingdom, the United States and destinations with open border rules may improve initially. Horst said that “even when international flights to Australia increase, air freight capacity is still in high demand, so until supply chain issues normalise, things won’t be operating as usual”. “People are going to be wary of travelling [to and from Australia], it’s not just a matter of getting in, it’s what happens when you’re there.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Horst said it would take until at least the second half of the year, just before businesses prepare for Christmas shipments, for freight capacities and costs to Australia to significantly improve, noting that the International Air Transport Association (Iata) are only predicting a return to 2019 air service levels by 2024. International airlines are operating about 20% of the number of passenger services into Australia compared to pre-pandemic levels – not factoring in Western Australia, where traffic is 1% – according to the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia (Bara). Before the pandemic, airlines operated about 2,000 flights to Australia a week, with 840,000 passengers and 22,000 tonnes of freight, generating revenues of $38bn in 2018-19, Bara estimates. The same figure for 2020-21 fell to $6.5bn. Bara, along with other industry bodies including the Australian Airports Association and the Tourism and Transport Forum, have praised the federal government’s announcement this week and remain confident they can begin to scale up services by 21 February, when all remaining visa holders who are double vaccinated will be able to enter Australia. In a statement sent to member airlines on Wednesday, Bara said “the recovery in international aviation depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside the control of the industry”. “Consumer confidence to travel with Covid-19 widely circulating in many countries will be a major influence.” Bara also said the requirement for a negative pre-departure PCR test for travellers to Australia “is commonly cited [as a] barrier to international travel”, as well as the varied testing and self-isolation requirements across states. “These differing arrangements will create confusion for international tourists about their obligations when they travel to Australia and across states and territories within Australia.” Bara is also calling for state and territory governments to end mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for unvaccinated arrivals, noting its burden on health resources when the virus is already circulating in the community, and the complexity the rule brings to international airlines. “It is administratively difficult and expensive for them to operate two passenger groups.”",News/Australia news,"Australia’s border reopening no panacea for parcel deliveries, freight industry warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/australias-border-reopening-no-panacea-for-parcel-deliveries-freight-industry-warns
2/9/2022,"The Queensland government’s response to a gas seep “capable of posing risk to life or property” near Chinchilla included a briefing memo about the incident that described a local Knitting Nannas Against Gas group as a “risk”. On 24 July 2020, a landowner about 10km from Chinchilla discovered water and gas bubbling from several former coal exploration bores on the property. The seep occurred near a section of the Condamine River where methane had previously bubbled to the surface.  Documents released under Queensland Right to Information laws detail how the bores were releasing water and gas in an “uncontrolled manner that would appear to be capable of posing a risk to life or property” and required “urgent remediation” work, according to the state Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy. Conservation group Lock the Gate claims the documents show the government did not act with necessary urgency – it took six days for the state department to consult with resource companies and authorise access to the site for remediation. One briefing note written by departmental staff on 30 July 2020 – the same day the remediation was authorised – lists “risks” associated with the incident. “The risk of media attention is considered low due to the borehole location being away from public view,” the memo says. “However, it is noted that anti coal-seam gas (CSG) sentiment exists around Chinchilla, with an active ‘Knitting Nannas Against Gas’ group, and several anti-CSG advocates and landholders in the area. “There is a low/moderate risk that the brackish water discharge could negatively impact the landholder’s cropping land and/or dam water. “This risk is mitigated by the swift and active management of the incident.” Leanne Brummell, a member of the Knitting Nannas Against Gas group from St George, said it was troubling the government “was worried about a threat from the Nannas while a potential contamination emergency was unfolding”. “It’s totally appalling that it took the government so long to … fix this mess,” Brummell said. “A similar incident would be fixed immediately if it happened on William Street outside the government’s ivory tower.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the previous few years, gas seeps in the vicinity of the same Chinchilla property had created concern among opponents of the CSG industry. In 2016, the NSW Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham set methane bubbles on the Condamine River on fire. A report commissioned by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science last year found that Condamine bubbles are “a natural system” but that “the gas escape is enhanced by down-dip CSG production, which is approximately 1km away”. The exploration boreholes discovered bubbling in 2020 were drilled in 2007 by coalminer Yancoal at a site about 10km south-west of Chinchilla. The property has overlapping coal and petroleum leases, and ultimately the operator of the petroleum lease – Origin – plugged the seeps with concrete. Origin required government authorisation to enter the property and complete the remediation, and emails detail how this process took six days as public servants sought the input of both resource companies. Both Yancoal and Origin were supportive of the remediation work. Lock the Gate’s Queensland spokesperson, Ellie Smith, said the government had allowed CSG companies “to run rampant … without first commissioning detailed research into the risks”. “The July 2020 incident … laid bare the Palaszczuk government’s inability to swiftly respond to such emergencies,” Smith said.
