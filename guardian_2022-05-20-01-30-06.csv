5/20/2022,"About 25 fishing boats have sailed into the mouth of the River Tees while setting off flares and fireworks in a protest over mass marine deaths that are ruining livelihoods as well as being a “huge ecological disaster”. More than 200 well-wishers, many representing conservation and environmental campaigns, cheered from the shore, chanted “Stop the sludge” and sang protest songs. Large wash-ups of dead crabs, lobsters and other marine life have been reported on England’s north-east coast since last October. A government investigation in February ruled out dredging as the cause and concluded that a naturally occurring algal bloom was the most likely culprit. However, fishers have rejected that explanation, blaming the dumping of contaminated, dredged sediment, and want the investigation reopened. “Emotions are running very high,” said Sally Bunce, a marine mammal rescuer, one of hundreds supporting the protest from the shore at South Gare, a spit of land in Redcar at the mouth of the Tees. “These fishermen have had no income for eight months and they are getting no help from anybody. Farmers get compensated for BSE, avian flu … The fishermen have got nothing. “We still have crab and lobster washing up dead on beaches in their thousands. We’ve got seal pups that are dying of starvation.” The boats came from harbours between Scarborough and Hartlepool. One of the protesters was Joe Redfern, a co-founder of Whitby Lobster Hatchery and the chairman of Whitby Commercial Fishing Association, who said: “We are facing a huge ecological disaster. “It is deeply concerning. The catch rates have dropped; there is no life in the rock pools; there are dead and dying marine animals washing up and in our pots.” Campaigners say the blame for the deaths lies with 250,000 tonnes of dredged sediment from the Tees that was dumped two and a half miles offshore. David McCreadie, a retired marine biologist and oceanographer, came across one of the first dead lobsters last October and stopped walking his dog on the beach. “Within weeks, there were hundreds of dogs going to the vets, ill,” he said. Rowan McLaughlin, a co-coordinator of the South Tees Green party who attended the protest, said: “I’m here because I live by the sea. All this affects me. It affects my family; it affects jobs … We shouldn’t be polluting our sea. This idea that it is an algal bloom is just nonsense.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are monitoring recent wash-ups at South Gare and the Tees area. Small-scale wash-ups can occur naturally due to seasonality and weather conditions and we are working closely with partner agencies to support the monitoring and recovery of stocks. “We note that there are reports of poor catches and we are working with the industry and partner agencies to monitor this and are communicating regularly with the fishing community.” The company PD Ports, which manages the estuary, said it shared concerns about the large number of dead crustaceans along the shoreline. A spokesperson said that because they were the statutory harbour authority “we are required, by law, to dredge the river on a regular basis to ensure safe navigation and maintenance of the 12-mile stretch of river within our jurisdiction. “All dredging and sediment disposal takes place in compliance with strict environmental regulations by the Marine Management Organisation and Environment Agency, and is overseen by our expert team of marine and environmental specialists. “In addition to fulfilling our statutory legal requirements, this activity supports a thriving river and helps sustain thousands of livelihoods across the Tees valley and wider north-east, which are dependent on the river for global trade.”",News/Business,Fishers hold River Tees protest over mass crab and lobster deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/fishers-river-tees-protest-mass-crab-lobster-deaths
5/20/2022,"Police chiefs took a high-level policy decision not to place undercover officers into far-right groups when fascists were intimidating and attacking ethnic minority communities in the 1970s, a public inquiry has heard. The undercover police officers that were sent to infiltrate political groups during that time were exclusively targeted at leftwing and progressive groups, including those opposing fascists. Former DI Angus McIntosh told the inquiry on Thursday :“My recollection is that this was a high-level policy decision, and I certainly was too junior to be a part of this.” Asked why, he replied: “It was a very violent section, and it was often involved in crime, so to put an undercover officer into that would have very, very difficult”. Between 1976 and 1979, McIntosh was the deputy head of a Metropolitan police undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS). The inquiry – led by retired judge Sir John Mitting – is reviewing the activities of 139 undercover officers who spied on more than 1,000 mainly leftwing political groups between 1968 and at least 2010. The current phase of the inquiry is questioning the managers in charge of the covert operations between 1968 and 1982, and is due to end on Friday. In the 1970s, fascist organisations such as the National Front organised provocative marches through areas that had sizeable ethnic minority communities. The communities and anti-fascist campaigners resisted the marches amid public disorder on the streets. Geoffrey Craft, who led the SDS in 1976 and 1977, told the inquiry on Wednesday that police had “other sources in the far right” so it was not necessary to place undercover officers from his unit in fascist groups. This appears to be a reference to another method of infiltration – the use of informants. These are individuals who are members of groups and are persuaded through a variety of means to pass on information secretly to the police. The police used both methods of infiltration – undercover officers and informants – to collect information on leftwing activists. Barry Moss, the head of the SDS during 1980, told the inquiry last Friday: “There was probably a policy decision at that time not to deploy anyone into the far right, because they were too violent, and we were concerned what the officer may have to do to prove his credentials.” Moss blamed leftwing groups for causing disorder when they sought to prevent fascist marches, adding: “If the National Front had just been allowed to demonstrate and the left wing hadn’t turned up, there probably wouldn’t have been any disorder”. An undercover police officer who infiltrated the leftwing Socialist Workers party (SWP) in the 1970s, was asked by the inquiry who initiated the violence on the streets during these demonstrations. He replied: “It depended on exactly where it was and how many people were there. From the SWP side, it was mostly shouting. From the far right thing, it was mostly physical violence.” The SDS, which was founded in 1968, first sent one of its undercover officers to infiltrate the far right in the 1980s. After that, a handful of far-right groups were monitored. An analysis of the political groups that were known to have been spied on by undercover officers between 1968 and 2010 shows that the police overwhelmingly spied on leftwing and progressive political groups.",News/UK news,UK police took high-level decision not to go undercover in far-right groups in 1970s,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/uk-police-took-high-level-decision-not-to-go-undercover-in-far-right-groups-in-1970s
5/20/2022,"Dave has been crowned songwriter of the year and Sam Fender has picked up his first prize at this year’s Ivor Novello awards, which celebrate Britain’s best songwriters and composers. Winning his fourth Ivor in five years, Dave was commended for his second album We’re All Alone in This Together, which topped UK charts and spawned three simultaneous top 10 singles – Clash (featuring Stormzy), Verdansk and In the Fire. As part of his continuing collaboration with Fredo, the rapper also co-wrote the hugely successful tracks Back to Basics and Money Talks, the Ivors Academy said. Following a Brit award win for best hip-hop/grime/rap act earlier this year, Dave dedicated his award to “the rappers that have suffered for years and years, and broken down so many barriers in this industry that I’m in right now”. Fender took home his first Ivor after winning best song musically and lyrically for the track Seventeen Going Under, which chronicles his life at the age of 17 and the challenges he and his mother faced. The North Shields singer-songwriter recently sold out his “biggest gig to date” at Finsbury Park in London, following in the footsteps of Arctic Monkeys, Queens of the Stone Age, Pulp and Liam Gallagher. Ed Sheeran, Fred Again and Johnny McDaid won in the most performed work category for their collaboration on the UK’s biggest song of 2021, Bad Habits. It is Sheeran’s fifth Ivor, after he won in the same category in 2019 alongside McDaid for Shape of You. With a catalogue of more than 140 songs and more than 80m record sales, a special international award celebrated the global impact and songwriting achievements of the Colombian superstar Shakira. The award for best contemporary song went to Dean “Inflo” Josiah Cover and Little Simz for I Love You, I Hate you, a powerful address to Little Simz’s father from the album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. Inflo was nominated for four awards this year, more than any other person. In total, 21 songwriters and composers collected Ivor Novello awards across 14 categories at a ceremony at London’s Grosvenor House on Thursday. Laura Mvula won the award for best album for Pink Noise, which she wrote with Dann Hume. “Sometimes it was hard to imagine getting to the finish line, so to know that it has made some impact in such strange times is really exciting for me,” Mvula has told the Guardian. Breakout talent Naomi Kimpenu became the third consecutive female songwriter to win the rising star award for her debut EP Prelude. The four-track collection was described as “the ideal calling card, serving notice of what her perfectly poised vocals and sincere songwriting can do”. Meanwhile, the “icon” award recognised “two of rock’s most inspiring, influential, and identifiable songwriters”: the Cure’s Robert Smith and Simon Gallup. Peter Gabriel received the fellowship of the Ivors Academy in recognition of his outstanding contributions as a musician, innovator, humanitarian and songwriter. Daniel Blumberg won the award for best original film score for his work on The World to Come, Arthur Sharpe won best television soundtrack for his work on Sky Atlantic’s Landscapers, and Richard Jacques won best original video game score for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. Paul Heaton was awarded outstanding song collection, while the songwriters Elizabeth Fraser, Robin Guthrie and Simon Raymonde won the visionary award for their band Cocteau Twins. Shaznay Lewis, Ivor award winner and chair of the Ivors awards committee, said she was “absolutely thrilled” for this year’s winners. “It is a privilege to experience such an immensely powerful, emotive and eclectic range of music. Huge congratulations to everyone who took home awards, and every single songwriter and composer nominated,” she said. The Ivors Academy recently launched TheWRD, a pre-degree diploma in creative entrepreneurship designed to help open access to the creative industries. It was also announced that Lauren Laverne would take over as host from Paul Gambaccini, who retires after hosting the ceremony since 1988.",Arts/Music,Dave crowned songwriter of the year at Ivor Novello awards,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/19/dave-crowned-songwriter-of-the-year-at-ivor-novello-awards
5/20/2022,"Shareholders in Next have backed the company’s decision to pay its chief executive Simon Wolfson £4.4m this year, despite opposition from some investors concerned about the disparity between executive pay and wages of the wider workforce. Wolfson was awarded a 50% pay rise by the fashion retailer, taking his remuneration to the highest level since 2015. Before Next’s annual shareholder meeting (AGM) on Thursday, some institutional investors and advisory groups had expressed their concerns over the increase in Wolfson’s pay, and the fact that the company is not a living wage-accredited employer. Companies which are accredited as living wage employers have committed to paying all of their employees a rate based on living costs, which stands at £9.90 per hour across the UK, and £11.05 in London. The Church of England pensions board, which manages £3bn of investments and is a Next shareholder, had said in advance of the AGM that it intended to vote against the pay award. “The executive remuneration system is broken,” said Adam Matthews, chief responsible investment officer at the pension board. In a post on LinkedIn, Matthews wrote that there had been previous examples of what he called “excessive pay” at large companies. “There are occasional rebellions of shareholders, but then attention diverts and we all waste our time trying to decipher ever complicated justifications for excessive pay,” Matthews wrote. He added that the fund did not object to senior executives being rewarded fairly, but said this was “particularly egregious at a time that many of the workers in many of these companies will be struggling with the growing costs of living. “You have major increases in executive pay in consumer facing companies such as Next where the workforce are not accredited as being on a living wage. “There is a societal crisis unfolding before us and in the UK you have over three-quarters of churches involved in supporting foodbanks that are not just providing food to people out of work but those in work that cannot make ends meet,” he wrote. The Institutional Voting Information Service (IVIS), which is part of the Investment Association and advises investors on corporate governance, had marked Next’s annual remuneration report with a “red top” warning, suggesting that shareholders vote against. Despite the opposition, just 7.5% of shareholders voted against the company’s plans to award Wolfson an annual bonus worth 100% of his basic salary and two share bonuses based on long-term performance. The Guardian understands that IVIS informed shareholders that it noted Next’s financial performance during the pandemic, but raised concerns about whether bonus payments were appropriate after the company received taxpayer support from the government furlough scheme during Covid and had failed to give a clear indication of whether it had repaid or intends to repay the money. Next repaid £29m of business rates relief last summer, intended to cover the period when its shops were open. A spokesperson for the company has previously said any further relief for when shops were open has also been repaid. The company’s annual report says the furlough support had allowed Next to continue to “employ talented colleagues whom we might otherwise have been required to make redundant”. The group’s remuneration committee added that executive pay was “proportionate and aligned to business performance”.",News/Business,Next chief to get 50% pay rise to £4.4m despite shareholder opposition,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/next-shareholders-agree-to-44m-pay-package-for-chief-despite-opposition
5/20/2022,"Haleh Afshar, Lady Afshar, who has died aged 77 of kidney failure, was an Iranian-born scholar whose life’s work was one of the most contentious subjects of our time: Islamic feminism. She spent most of her academic career at the University of York, where she was professor of politics and women’s studies from 1999, and her advisory roles with the government on engaging with women led to a life peerage in 2007. She wrote or edited many books, including Iran: a Revolution in Turmoil; Islam and Feminisms; and Women in the Middle East: Perceptions, Realities and Struggles for Liberation. Her scholarship was rigorously academic but her ideas had real-world consequences: she used the Qu’ran to promote women’s rights to own property, to contribute to public debate, to be paid for housework. She saw no contradiction in describing herself as both a feminist and a Shia Muslim. Her thinking can be summarised in her forthright critical assessment of the government of Iran when it barred the way to education for women: “They’re scared of educated women. Because educated women can actually read classical Arabic, access the Qur’anic teachings, and demand their rights, contextualised in the Qur’anic teachings … taking on the Iranian government on its own terms.” Women’s education and women’s voices were at the centre of her work. I first met Haleh more than 20 years ago when I was director of the Women’s National Commission, which, until its abolition in 2010, was the British government’s official independent advisory body on women. She was appointed in 2008 as one of 12 independent commissioners, with the remit of bringing the informed opinion of women to government. Haleh’s activism was indistinguishable from her theoretical work. She was a fighter as well as a scholar, and she fought, usually successfully, for women threatened with deportation. After the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005 she was invited to chair a new independent committee to advise the government on the views of women in the British Muslim community. This was the brainchild of Patricia Hewitt, then the Labour government’s minister for women and equality, and under Haleh’s leadership the committee made the case for listening to Muslim women’s voices. Haleh led a roadshow round the UK to hear what British Muslim women were saying, and she fought hard to make sure the subsequent report was published exactly as it stood, resisting pressure to water it down and dealing openly with difficult issues, such as child sexual abuse. The members of that committee went on to form the independent Muslim Women’s Network, of which Haleh was a founding member and later honorary president, its mission of empowering Muslim women through Islamic feminism being close to her heart. She was born in Tehran, the daughter of an affluent family. Her mother, Pouran Khabir, was a successful campaigner for women’s suffrage. Her father, Hassan Afshar, was a law professor at Tehran University and also served as a government minister. Educated first at the Jeanne d’Arc school in Tehran, at the age of 14 she persuaded her parents to let her board in the UK at St Martin’s school in Solihull, which she later described as “dark and drab” after a childhood under the Iranian sun. After A-levels at college in Brighton, in 1963 she enrolled at the then brand-new University of York, graduating in social sciences in 1967. In 1972 she took a diploma in comparative European law at the University of Strasbourg, followed by a doctorate in land economy at Cambridge University in 1974. Haleh returned to Iran in the last decade of the shah’s rule, working in the land reform ministry, and as a journalist. She spent time visiting remote villages, talking to the people, especially to women. She became aware that, in an authoritarian regime, there was widespread ignorance about women’s Islamic rights. This formative experience set a pattern for her life: to challenge power. Soon she fell out with the land reform minister. That proved to be just the start – she fell out of favour with the entire regime with the publication of an article exposing gossip around the Iranian royals. She finally fled Iran as persona non grata. The fall of the shah and his secret police was followed by the arrival of the ayatollahs and theirs. She would never return to her homeland. After a lectureship at Bradford University from 1976 to 1985, she was appointed to York, lecturing in health economics before moving into the department of politics and the centre for women’s studies in 1987, becoming professor in 1999 and emeritus in 2011. She was also visiting professor of Islamic law at the Robert Schuman University in Strasbourg. In 2008 she made an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, revealing an eclectic taste in music, ranging from Persian love songs to the Beatles’ Yellow Submarine, and a mischievous, unforgettable and idiosyncratic style. She pushed boundaries and prodded at privilege. Her home was a place of extraordinary hospitality and warmth, where students and friends from all over the world thronged to enjoy Iranian cooking and stimulating conversation. Shakespeare’s phrase “though she be but little she is fierce” might have been written for Haleh. Yet her fierceness was tempered by a wonderful pealing laugh and charm that could disarm her most implacable opponents, be they religious leaders or government ministers. She was made OBE in 2005 and a member of the House of Lords in 2007, where she sat as a crossbencher. She was an academician of the Academy of Social Sciences and held honorary doctorates from the universities of Essex and Bradford. She married Maurice Dodson, emeritus professor of maths at York University, in 1974, and they had two children, Ali and Molly. Haleh was dogged by health problems, always disguised by her apparently endless energy and enthusiasm, but she was given a new lease of life when Maurice donated a kidney. He survives her, as do their children and their grandchildren, Kate and Hattie.

5/20/2022,"The former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder will lose some of his post-office privileges after failing to cut his links with Russian energy companies over the Ukraine war, the Bundestag’s budgetary committee has decided. Schröder, who was German head of government from 1998 until 2005, will be stripped of his office and staff, which cost about 419,000 euros (£354,500) in taxpayers’ money in 2021. The motion, which was passed on Thursday afternoon with support from Schröder’s own Social Democratic party (SPD), the Greens, and the Free Democratic party (FDP), does not name the politician’s Kremlin connections or stance on the Ukraine war, most likely to avoid legal challenges. Instead, the motion argues that the former leader no longer fulfils any continuing obligation as a statesperson and therefore does not require an office and staff to do so. The main opposition party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), backed the move even though it had also called on the government to cut the ex-chancellor’s pension, equivalent to an annual salary of about 100,000 euros. Schröder will keep his pension payments as well as his security detail. The four employees who used to work at Schröder’s office, located almost directly opposite the Russian embassy on the Unter den Linden boulevard in Berlin, already resigned of their own accord in early March, after their boss had showed no intention of stepping down from his boardroom roles at Russian oil company Rosneft and pipeline company Nord Stream. The Bundestag budgetary committee’s vote comes just hours after the European parliament urged the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to impose sanctions against Schröder because of his ties to the Kremlin. The EU legislature passed a resolution on Thursday that said sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine should be extended “to the European members of the boards of major Russian companies and to politicians who continue to receive Russian money”. As well as the German politician, the motion indirectly addresses former Austrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl, a supervisory board member at Rosneft who danced with Vladimir Putin at her own wedding in 2018. Schröder’s close personal friendship with Putin has come under heavy criticism after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and the SPD leadership has called on the 78-year-old to hand in his party membership. The Hanover-based politician has come across as unrepentant, however. “I don’t do mea culpa,” Schröder told the New York Times in April. “It’s not my thing.”",News/World news,Gerhard Schröder to be stripped of privileges for not cutting ties with Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/gerhard-schroder-to-be-stripped-of-office-for-not-cutting-ties-with-russia
5/20/2022,"Consumers could be hit with higher egg prices as UK farmers reduce their flock numbers, in response to escalating costs and insufficient profit margins. The numbers of chicks being placed by egg producers in April was down 15% year on year, according to the latest government figures. Egg farmers have been warning for months that a “tidal wave” of rising costs in feed, energy, labour and packaging was not being reflected in retail prices.They have criticised supermarkets for ignoring industry warnings, with a leading producer telling delegates at the British Pig and Poultry Fair last week he expected a shortage of eggs later this year given the cuts in chick placings. The government data, published on Thursday, confirms a decline in producers restocking their flocks with new birds. The number of eggs being set by hatcheries fell even further in April, down 35% on the previous year. The number of chicks being placed by egg producers indicates the number of eggs that will be available to consumers in the months ahead. Hen eggs take about 21 days to hatch, but chicks do not start laying until they are aged about 20 weeks. Any reduction in chicks now will not affect the availability of eggs until the autumn. The existing hens on farms will continue producing eggs until they are 70 to 80 weeks old, but the overall flock population will fall as hens are not replaced. “It’s showing what we were predicting, that there will be a shortage unless retailers respond by raising prices,” said Robert Gooch, chief executive of the British FreeRange Egg Producers Association. Gooch says producers need a 3p per egg price increase to forestall a much bigger price rise when supplies fall later this year. Retail egg prices in May were up by about 8%, or 15p, per half dozen from last year, according to Trolley.co.uk, a supermarket price tracker. “If you were making money you wouldn’t do it [not restock]. You only do it because you can’t make a profit. It’s a crisis for producers and it will translate into a crisis for consumers later this year,” said Gooch. Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, said supermarkets sourced most of their food from the UK and “know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers to ensure British eggs remain on the shelves”.A spokesperson for the British Egg Industry Council said chick placements did historically rise and fall depending on factors such as how long producers decide to keep their existing hens before replacing them. “However, with the current cost crisis, some producers are choosing not to repopulate their houses.”Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

5/20/2022,"Chemical pollution in the environment is supersizing the global obesity epidemic, according to a major scientific review. The idea that the toxins called “obesogens” can affect how the body controls weight is not yet part of mainstream medicine. But the dozens of scientists behind the review argue that the evidence is now so strong that it should be. “This is critical because the current clinical management of obese patients is woefully inadequate,” they said. The most disturbing aspect of the evidence is that some chemical impacts that increase weight can be passed down through generations by changing how genes work. Pollutants cited by the researchers as increasing obesity include bisphenol A (BPA), which is widely added to plastics, as well as some pesticides, flame retardants and air pollution. Global obesity has tripled since 1975, with more people now obese or overweight than underweight, and is increasing in every country studied. Almost 2 billion adults are now too heavy and 40 million children under five are obese or overweight. “The focus of the clinical people is on calories – if you eat more calories, you’re going to be more fat,” says Dr Jerrold Heindel, lead author of one of the three review papers, and formerly at the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “So they wait untill you get obese, then they’ll look at giving you diets, drugs, or surgery. “If that really worked, we should see a decline in the rates of obesity,” he said. “But we don’t – obesity continues to rise, especially in children. The real question is, why do people eat more? The obesogenic paradigm focuses on that and provides data that indicate that these chemicals are what can do that.” Furthermore, the scientists say, the approach offers the potential to prevent obesity by avoiding exposure to pollutants, especially in pregnant women and babies: “Prevention saves lives, while costing far less than any [treatment].” The evidence for obesogens is set out by more than 40 scientists in three review papers, published in the peer-reviewed journal Biochemical Pharmacology and citing 1,400 studies. They say these chemicals are everywhere: in water and dust, food packaging, personal hygiene products and household cleaners, furniture and electronics. The review identifies about 50 chemicals as having good evidence of obesogenic effects, from experiments on human cells and animals, and epidemiological studies of people. These include BPA and phthalates, also a plastic additive. A 2020 analysis of 15 studies found a significant link between BPA levels and obesity in adults in 12 of them. Other obesogens are pesticides, including DDT and tributyltin, former flame retardants and their newer replacements, dioxins and PCBs, and air pollution. Several recent studies link exposure to dirty air early in life to obesity. The review also names PFAS compounds – so-called “forever chemicals” due to their longevity in the environment – as obesogens. These are found in food packaging, cookware, and furniture, including some child car seats. A two-year, randomised clinical trial published in 2018 found people with the highest PFAS levels regained more weight after dieting, especially women. Some antidepressants are also well known to cause weight gain. “That is a proof of principle that chemicals made for one thing can have side effects that interfere with your metabolism,” said Heindel. Other chemicals with some evidence of being obesogens included some artificial sweeteners and triclosan, an antibacterial agent banned from some uses in the US in 2017. Obesogens work by upsetting the body’s “metabolic thermostat”, the researchers said, making gaining weight easier and losing weight harder. The body’s balance of energy intake and expenditure through activity relies on the interplay of various hormones from fat tissue, the gut, pancreas, liver, and brain. The pollutants can directly affect the number and size of fat cells, alter the signals that make people feel full, change thyroid function and the dopamine reward system, the scientists said. They can also affect the microbiome in the gut and cause weight gain by making the uptake of calories from the intestines more efficient. “It turns out chemicals dumped in the environment have these side effects, because they make the cells do things that they wouldn’t otherwise have done, and one of those things is laying down fat,” said Prof Robert Lustig at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of another of the reviews. The early years of child development are the most vulnerable to obesogens, the researchers wrote: “Studies showed that in utero and early-life exposures were the most sensitive times, because this irreversibly altered programming of various parts of the metabolic system, increasing susceptibility for weight gain.” “We’ve got four or five chemicals that also will cause transgenerational epigenetic obesity,” said Heindel, referring to changes in the expression of genes that can be inherited. A 2021 study found that women’s level of obesity significantly correlated with their grandmothers’ level of exposure to DDT, even though their granddaughters were never directly exposed to the now banned-pesticide. “People need to know that [obesogenic effects] are going on,” Lustig said. “Because it affects not just them, but their unborn children. This problem’s going to affect generation after generation until we get a hold of it.” Directly proving a causal link between a hazard and a human health impact is difficult for the simple reason that it is not ethical to perform harmful experiments on people. But strong epidemiological evidence can stack up to a level equivalent to proof, such as with tobacco smoking and lung cancer. Lustig said that point had been reached for obesogens, 16 years after the term was first coined. “We’ll never have randomised control trials – they would be illegal and unethical. But we now have the proof for obesogens and obesity.” The obesogen paradigm has not been taken up by mainstream researchers so far. But Prof Barbara Corkey, at Boston University School of Medicine and past president of the Obesity Society, said: “The initial worldview was that obesity is caused by eating too much and exercising too little. And this is nonsense. “It’s not the explanation because all of the creatures on Earth, including humans, eat when they’re hungry and stop when they are full. Every cell in the body knows if you have enough food,” she said. “Something has disrupted that normal sensing apparatus and it is not volition. “People who are overweight and obese go to tremendous extremes to lose weight and the diet industry has fared extremely well,” Corky said. “We’ve learned that doesn’t work. When the medical profession doesn’t understand something, we always blame patients and unfortunately, people are still being held responsible for [obesity].” Lustig said: “Gluttony and sloth are just the outward manifestations of these biochemical perturbations that are going on beneath the surface.” How much of the obesity pandemic may be caused by obesogens is not known, though Heindel said they will have an “important role”. Lustig said: “If I had to guess, based on all the work and reading I’ve done, I would say obesogens will account for about 15% to 20% of the obesity epidemic. But that’s a lot.” The rest he attributes to processed food diets, which themselves contain some obesogens. “Fructose is a primary driver of a lot of this,” he said. “It partitions energy to fat in the liver and is a prime obesogen. Fructose would cause obesity even if it didn’t have calories.” A small 2021 trial found that an ultra-processed diet caused more weight gain than an unprocessed diet, despite containing the same calories. Cutting exposure to obesogens is difficult, given that there are now 350,000 synthetic chemicals, many of which are pervasive in the environment. But those known to be harmful can be removed from sale, as is happening in Europe. Heindel said prospective mothers in particular could adjust what they eat and monitor what their children play with in their early years: “Studies have shown modifying diets can within a week or so cause a significant drop in several obesogens.” Lustig said: “This cause is very pervasive and pernicious, and it’s also lucrative to a lot of [chemical] companies. But we must address it rationally.” To do that, the “knowledge gap” among doctors, regulators and policymakers must be addressed, the scientists said. “It’s time now that [obesity researchers and clinicians] should start paying attention and, if they don’t think the data is strong enough, tell us what more to do,” said Heindel, who is organising a conference to tackle this issue. Corkey is yet to be fully convinced by the obesogen paradigm, but said the concept of an environmental toxin is probably the right direction to go in. “Is there proof? No, there is not,” she said. “It’s a very difficult problem, because the number of chemicals in our environment has just astronomically increased. “But there’s no alternative hypothesis that to me makes any sense and I would certainly challenge anyone who has a better, testable idea to come forth with it,” she said. “Because this is a serious problem that is impacting our societies enormously, especially children. The problems are getting worse, not better – we’re going in the wrong direction as it stands.”",News/Environment,"Environmental toxins are worsening obesity pandemic, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/environmental-toxins-are-worsening-obesity-pandemic-say-scientists
5/20/2022,"Sri Lanka has defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history as it struggles with an economic and political crisis triggered by global shock waves from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. An inflation rate spiralling towards 40%, shortages of food, fuel and medicines and rolling power blackouts have led to nationwide protests and a plunging currency, with the government short of the foreign currency reserves it needed to pay for imports. The Sri Lankan central bank governor said on Thursday that the oldest democracy in Asia had fallen into a “pre-emptive default” on its debts after the expiry of a 30-day grace period for missed interest payments on two of its sovereign bonds. It is the first default by an Asia-Pacific nation this century, according to the credit rating agency Moody’s. Sri Lanka said last month that it would stop repaying its international debts to conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves, vital for importing key raw materials from overseas. Speaking on Thursday after the deadline passed for making $78m (£62.8m) of payments to international creditors, Nandalal Weerasinghe, the central bank governor, said: “Our position is very clear: until there is a debt restructure, we cannot repay.” Sri Lanka has suspended repayments on about $7bn of international loans due this year, out of a total foreign debt pile worth $51bn. The country’s finance ministry has said it has $25m in usable foreign reserves. Economists fear Sri Lanka could be the first in a wave of defaults, as other low- and middle-income countries struggle with runaway inflation and supply shocks. The IMF has opened rescue talks with Egypt and Tunisia, both big importers of wheat from Russia and Ukraine, and with Pakistan, which has imposed power cuts because of the high cost of imported energy. Turkey is battling 70% inflation but has so far avoided the need for a bailout. Weerasinghe told a news conference on Thursday that adequate dollars had been released to pay for fuel and cooking gas shipments, helped by $130m from the World Bank and remittances in foreign currency sent home by Sri Lankans working overseas. The central bank alongside the government has begun discussions with the International Monetary Fund aimed at working towards a programme to address its economic challenges. “Expeditious arrangements are being made to commence the external debt restructuring process,” it said. Negotiations have also been started to obtain bridging finance to secure foreign currency required to finance imports of essential goods and to strengthen the nation’s social safety net programmes, it added. Sri Lanka’s new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said this week that the crisis would get worse in the next couple of months before it could get better. The worst economic crisis since Sri Lanka’s independence in 1948 has led to the resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister after months of protests that involved violent, fatal clashes on the streets of the capital. The Covid pandemic had triggered a collapse in tourism, leading to a fall in foreign currency income and rising debt levels – a situation made worse by the surge in global commodity prices this spring, exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who appointed Wickremesinghe to replace his brother as prime minister, has continued to refuse to bow to demands of the electorate and has held on to power. Inflation in Sri Lanka is expected to rise close to 40% within months, having reached almost 30% in April, with food prices up by about half in the past year. The Sri Lankan rupee has fallen by 45% against the dollar since the central bank stopped defending the currency in early March, at a time when the US currency has risen sharply in value on foreign exchange markets as the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates in response to rising inflationary pressures.",News/World news,Sri Lanka defaults on debts for first time ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/sri-lanka-defaults-on-debts-for-first-time
5/20/2022,"The Metropolitan police have confirmed that Boris Johnson will not receive any more fines for lockdown-breaching gatherings after an investigation into events in Downing Street and Whitehall. The police force said it had issued a total of 126 fixed-penalty notices, covering all 12 events investigated. Here, people tell the Guardian about the family members they lost during lockdown and how they feel about the outcome of the investigation. I’m beyond outraged. One [fixed-penalty notice] should have been enough anyway as it proved he misled parliament. How is he still PM? I find it insulting, disgusting and depressing in equal measure. It’s an indicator of how low morals are in the Conservative party generally, and it’s alarming to watch him lie. I lost my dad in April 2021. He was admitted to Treliske hospital, who informed us they could not save him from bacterial pneumonia. I do not know if he knew the prognosis. We were unable to be with him at the end, which was devastating for us as a family. I cannot say more than that as I find it too upsetting to recall. The only blessing is he did not have to witness how low Johnson has dragged the reputation of the UK, and the terrible damage he is inflicting upon us. He was 95 and got ill. I cannot blame Johnson for that, but the manner of his death and subsequent restrictions on his funeral were due to laws made by this government which Johnson ignored with impunity. He treats us with contempt and I cannot look at him without feeling physically sick. I am not alone. Penny Roberts, 62, NHS administrator, Illogan, Cornwall I used to think that there was a certain base level of fairness in our society which overrode privilege and position. No longer. I think that all the fines that were extracted from the rest of the population for organising or presiding over gatherings should be repaid. I know it will never happen but I still think it should. I’m not much of a royalist but the image I can’t get out of my mind is the Queen sitting alone at her husband’s funeral. The head of state obeying the rules to the letter. I cannot imagine how Scotland Yard will be able to justify this. It will further erode confidence in the Metropolitan police. Peter Grimsdale, 67, author, former Channel 4 head of religion In September 2020, my grandmother died alone, with no members of her family around her. Only three of us were able to even go to her funeral. We were extremely close and I had always promised her that I would not let her die alone. I had to break that promise because of the laws which were made and broken by Boris Johnson and his team. I will never forgive them. The prime minister was responsible for the laws which were made at the time, and should be held to AT LEAST an equivalent standard to anybody else. If there was an event which other people have been fined for attending, and he also attended the same event, I find it incomprehensible that he should not also be fined. He should be answerable for every event which took place at Downing Street during the whole period, it being both his home and his workplace. Either he knew about all of them (even if he managed to resist attending any of them) and is therefore culpable, or he didn’t know what was going on around him involving his family and staff, and he is therefore incompetent. Alex McKeown, 43, teacher, West Sussex I am amazed, but at the same time, not surprised. Johnson (and his enablers/colleagues) have done more in the last few years to erode public trust in government and other institutions than any other government at any point I can remember in my lifetime, and it is that which perhaps worries me more than this particular incident. The behaviour of Johnson and his cabinet falls far short of what we should expect of our leaders; the lying, self-serving approach, the blatant cronyism – is causing people now, more than ever, to think that there is absolutely no point in voting or engaging in politics, because it won’t make any difference. And this is the worst point of all. People now assume that there is nothing they can do and simply give up. Jim Rennie, 54, works for software company, Wallasey If there are no more fines due, that’s not a problem as long as the full and due process was carried out. It’s all about the PM being treated fairly but without favour too. Now there should be an immediate publication of the full and unredacted Sue Gray report. There’s no excuse for any more delay. Jon Gray, 44, university lecturer, Derbyshire I’m bored of the whole thing. It’s political points scoring by both sides. Pretty well everyone I know, and know of, broke the strict rules at some stage. There are bigger problems to sort out than having a drink, having a small gathering, having a curry. We are not a Chinese-style police state. Let’s move on. Mark, 62, lawyer, London I am appalled. He was at the same events as other people who received fines for being there. Why wasn’t he fined again? It’s honestly not surprising. If the Tories want to tie themselves to his sinking ship then let them. They are completely and utterly out of touch on everything that relates to the general public, including Partygate and the cost of living crisis. The leader of our country should be adhering to the highest of standards; there are no excuses and he is not fit to lead. The prime minister broke the law whilst at work. If I had done that I would’ve been sacked. His status and position of power enable him to get away with this behaviour and I am disgusted that his fellow Tory MPs are allowing it to carry on.

5/20/2022,"The EU ambassador to the UK has rejected Liz Truss’s demand that the Northern Ireland protocol be rewritten, and issued a blunt warning of retaliation if the government passes a law disapplying aspects of the agreement. “Unilateral calls for unilateral; action calls for action,” João Vale de Almeida told journalists at Westminster. He lamented the continuing distrust between the two sides, and argued little had changed in the past 18 months since the government was threatening to pass the internal markets bill. “I’m worried about the low levels of trust that exist today, between the EU and the UK: between our leaders, between all of us that are involved in this relationship,” he said. “Some people call it a saga. If this is a saga, if I look at the new season of the saga, it looks pretty much like a similar plot. Not much has changed.” “We have the same narrative,” he added. “Using legislation to override an international treaty. I feel myself back in the fall of 2020, with the internal markets bill.” Vale de Almeida insisted there was no prospect of a change in the negotiating mandate given by the EU to its Brexit representative, Maroš Šefčovič – a demand made repeatedly by the foreign secretary. “We were told that we should get a new mandate. Well, I can tell you very clearly, what the member states are telling us is very simple: you don’t need a mandate, and even if you ask for one, you will not get it,” he said. “We can’t renegotiate the protocol: the ink on the signatures is hardly dry”. Truss set out her intentions in a dramatic statement earlier this week, in which she said she preferred a negotiated solution but set out plans for a bill that would rework aspects of the protocol. The stakes in the dispute have been raised since the DUP refused to take part in a power-sharing executive at Stormont unless the protocol is radically altered. Changes mooted by the government include creating a “green channel” to allow goods to pass without checks from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, as long as they are not destined for the Republic of Ireland. It would give the UK more powers to change VAT in Northern Ireland. But Vale de Almeida rejected the proposal. “The problem with this approach, we believe, is that it does not necessarily solve any problems, and it most likely creates more problems.” He suggested instead that the UK government return to proposals for applying the protocol already made by the EU. Truss rejected these as making the situation worse – but Brussels said ministers have not yet fully engaged with them. “We believe that what we put on the table, the potential of those proposals is not yet exhausted,” the ambassador said. “There is untapped potential in those proposals for us to find solutions – provided we are focused on finding solutions.” He argued that rocky relations over the protocol were having a knock-on effect on other aspects of the UK-EU relationship – including the UK’s participation in the Horizon programme of scientific cooperation. Acknowledging the importance of UK scientists to the scheme, Almeida conceded that it was “collateral damage” in the standoff over the protocol.",News/Politics,EU ambassador rejects Liz Truss’s demand to rewrite NI protocol ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/19/eu-ambassador-rejects-liz-trusss-demand-to-rewrite-ni-protocol
5/20/2022,"The dissident Russian film director Kirill Serebrennikov is calling for the lifting of sanctions on Roman Abramovich, one of the investors behind his latest film. The Russian oligarch, now trying to sell Chelsea football club because of financial restrictions imposed on on him by the British government, was a valuable patron of the arts, said the director. Abramovich’s record as a sponsor of important cinema should be taken into account, Serebrennikov added, speaking at the Cannes film festival. “We have to lift the sanctions against Abramovich. He has been a real patron of the arts and in Russia this has always been appreciated,” the director said after Wednesday night’s premiere of his film Tchaikovsky’s Wife, which is in competition for the festival’s coveted Palme d’Or prize. Serebrennikov is one of the few Russian film-makers asked to participate in the festival this year and he is using the platform to argue against a blanket boycott of art and culture from Russia in Europe. According to festival organisers, Serebrennikov’s competition entry is eligible because its production predated the war in Ukraine, although it is not clear if the decision is in line with current European sanctions on the financial interests of Russian oligarchs. Ukrainian delegates at Cannes have questioned the timing of the filming itself, which they allege may have continued into April. Questioned on Thursday, Serebrennikov said he had not received money directly from the Russian state since he was a student. Funds, he said, came then through the civil service, not directly from wealthy individuals. “Up to that point it was not toxic money,” he said. “There was nothing shameful about it.” He added that Abramovich’s film foundation, Kinoprime, had helped to fund his last two films. Tchaikovsky’s Wife portrays the troubled marriage of the composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Antonina Miliukova, and examines repressive 19th-century attitudes to homosexuality, to women and to mental health. A Cannes regular in recent years, Serebrennikov took part last year remotely, owing to the pandemic. His joy at attending in person this May was overshadowed by the war in Ukraine, he said. “I am not totally happy to be here because there are bombs falling on cities,” he said. The director explained his criticisms of the war have created problems for him in Russia. In 2020, Serebrennikov was convicted of embezzlement and given a suspended prison sentence, having previously criticised Russia’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and spoken out in support of Russia’s beleaguered LGBTQ+ community. “I was called into court and then I was released on bail. So I came to Europe, because that is where the work is.” This year the festival has not accepted official Russian delegations, and Serebrennikov questioned the widespread nature of such bans. “I can understand that people are calling for a boycott, but I don’t accept it,” he said. “What is happening in Ukraine is very painful. It’s unbearable,” he added, explaining that he believed “This Russian imperialist thrust should stop.” But he said he did not see that a comprehensive culture ban was the answer. “Culture is air, it is water and it is clouds, and so is totally independent of nationality,” he said. The issue of Russia’s place in the film industry, and of the role of entertainment during a war, continues to dominate the opening days of the festival, taking its cue from the speech that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered at the festival by screen on Tuesday. “Will cinema keep quiet, or will it speak up? If there is a dictator, if there is a war for freedom, once again everything depends on our unity. Can cinema stay outside of this unity?” Zelenskiy asked. Thursday also saw the premiere of the documentary Mariupolis 2, put together from the salvaged footage of a new project in Ukraine being made by the Lithuanian film-maker Mantas Kvedaravičius. Kvedaravičius was killed in the conflict, but his fiancee Hanna Bilobrova brought the footage the director had already completed to a special screening set up in the Palais des Festivals. Cannes will also see the controversial screening of The Natural History of Destruction, directed by Sergei Loznitsa, Ukraine’s best known film-maker, who is also of Russian and Belarusian descent. In March, the Ukrainian Film Academy expelled Loznitsa because he did not support its call to boycott all Russian movies. Serebrennikov was asked if he would donate the proceeds of Tchaikovsky’s Wife to Ukrainian war victims, something Abramovich has said he will do with money he receives from the sale of Chelsea FC. The actor Alyona Mikhailova, who plays the composer’s wife in his film, was visibly moved when Serebrennikov replied that he wanted support for Russian families who are badly affected by the war as well as for Ukrainians. “It is very important to help all the victims. People in Russia are traumatised, too, and some cannot work any more or they have left their families,” Serebrennikov said. His producer, Ilya Stewart, explained that it was unlikely there would be any proceeds. “We are very far away from earning money on this film. The background is that it was an investment in the arts.” Returning to his call for sanctions on the Chelsea FC owner to be lifted, Serebrennikov said: “Abramovich created Kinoprime to support the best Russian films in recent years and these are certainly not propaganda films, rather the contrary. Zelenskiy also asked that he should not be under any sanctions because he can be one of the key people to forge a peace.”",Arts/Film,Russian Cannes contender defends Roman Abramovich as a ‘patron of the arts’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/19/roman-abramovich-kirill-serebrennikova-russian-cannes-patron-of-the-arts
5/20/2022,"Global finance leaders should prepare for multiple inflationary shocks, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned, as fears of a global economic downturn continue to hit markets around the world. The IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said it is becoming harder for central banks to bring down inflation without causing recessions. Speaking at the sidelines of a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Germany, Georgieva cited mounting pressures on energy and food prices from Russia’s war in Ukraine, supply chain disruption and cost pressures caused by China’s zero-Covid policies. “I think what we need to start getting more comfortable with is, that may not be the last shock,” Georgieva said, adding that the outbreak of the Omicron coronavirus variant late last year had shown that inflation would not be a “transitory” one time shock. Inflation has risen to its highest level in about 40 years in both the UK and the US this year, and is the highest it’s been in the eurozone since statistics began in 1997. Investors fear that central banks risk a “hard landing”, pushing economies into recession, as they raise interest rates to bring inflation down towards target. London’s stock market tumbled into the red on Thursday, with the FTSE 100 index down 146 points or 2% in afternoon trading at 7,292. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down 1.3% with personal care companies, food and beverage companies, tech stocks and retailers all weakening. Wall Street opened lower, a day after its worst selloff in nearly two years, as major retailers reported that rising inflation was hitting consumer spending and eating into their profit margins. US department store chain Kohl’s slashed its profit and sales outlook, echoing Target and Walmart earlier this week. US jobless claims rose for the third week in a row, with 218,000 Americans seeking unemployment support last week. A survey of manufacturers in the Philadelphia region showed that growth almost stalled this month, as rising costs hit factories. “The reality is no matter which way your turn, warnings signs are flashing,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. Inflation hit confidence at UK factories too, where investment plans remained weak, according to the latest industrial trends reports from business body the CBI. The number of manufacturers planning to lift their own prices remained near a record high. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated that the US central bank will raise interest rates by 50 basis points in June and July, in its determination to pull US inflation down from 8.3% in April. That has driven up fears of a global slowdown. Joost van Leenders, senior investment strategist at wealth manager Van Lanschot Kempen, cautioned that the Fed wasn’t usually able to achieve a soft landing. “A recession is usually necessary to quash inflation. There is a slightly greater chance of a soft landing though if there are no major imbalances in the economy, especially if families and businesses don’t hold finance deficits. And, as it happens, that’s exactly the situation we’re in at the moment. A positive outcome is therefore possible, although the Fed has its work cut out,” Van Leenders said.",News/Business,IMF chief warns of multiple inflationary shocks amid market jitters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/imf-chief-warns-of-multiple-inflationary-shocks-amid-market-jitters
5/20/2022,"Like all good detective stories, the tale of Wagatha Christie ended with a twist. Coleen Rooney failed to turn up for the final day of the libel trial that has gripped the nation, choosing to go on a long-planned family holiday rather than watch the curtain fall on this particularly excruciating drama. The sight of one footballer’s wife accusing another of leaking intimate snippets from her private Instagram account to the Sun has become a guilty pleasure for many, a bit of light relief from worrying about the gas bill; two parts juicy celebrity gossip to one part fashion parade, it has teetered irresistibly on the brink of farce. Yet beneath the froth there were glimpses of something darker, a reminder of the human toll that judgment takes on all involved. A tearful Rebekah Vardy, who launched this case after Rooney had publicly implicated her in the leaking of stories about the latter’s private life, told the court that her former agent had been “driven to suicidal thoughts by the proceedings”, which have been rumbling on since 2019. Coleen’s husband, Wayne, meanwhile said he had watched her “really struggle” with the legal battle hanging over her head for two and a half years, becoming “a different mother, a different wife”. All the Rooneys wanted, he argued, was to put it all behind them. Your heart may not bleed for wealthy wives who could surely have settled their differences less painfully in private. But if these two found it stressful waiting for the chance to prove who leaked what from whose Instagram stories, then imagine how the victims of far greater injustices feel about waiting years for their day in court. Beyond the glossy high-profile world of celebrity trials, the wheels of justice for ordinary people now grind so slowly as to be visibly seizing up. One of the more depressing factors in the case of the unnamed MP arrested and then bailed this week on suspicion of rape and other offences is that the allegations were reportedly first made in January 2020. It has taken almost two and a half years even to reach this stage of investigation; the MP has not at the time of writing been charged, but if any trial is to follow, then it could still be many months away. The case of his former parliamentary colleague Charlie Elphicke, convicted in 2020 of sexual assault, took three years to reach court. These are just the delays we hear about, but countless other ordinary people are now stacked in the same cruel holding pattern: by the end of last December, 25% of cases in England and Wales had been waiting a year or more to come to court, and the number waiting more than a year had more than trebled since March 2020, when Britain first locked down. Behind those numbers are victims who can’t move on from a trauma they know they’ll have to relive in court, witnesses worrying that with every passing day their memories grow hazier, and defendants, too, whose lives are in limbo. The Conservative party’s handling of the unnamed MP, who has not been suspended but merely asked to refrain from attending parliament, may be partly coloured by fear of yet another byelection. But it also reflects a dilemma facing other employers over how to deal fairly with someone who may or may not be guilty, when it could be years before the courts produce a definitive answer. This week the four inspectors variously of prisons, probation, the Crown Prosecution Service and the constabulary gave evidence to the Commons justice select committee, over what they say is the now parlous state of the criminal justice system, post-pandemic. Some prisoners are still spending upwards of 22 hours a day locked up in their cells, the committee heard, leaving no time for meaningful rehabilitation and raising the likely risk of reoffending. In more than half of probation cases examined, assessment and management of the risk of harm offenders posed to the public was deemed unsatisfactory. The courts meanwhile are struggling not only with a backlog of cases built up well before the pandemic, but with a mutiny among criminal lawyers that now threatens to bring the system to its knees. A world away from Vardy v Rooney, with its suave and formidably expensive QCs, the everyday business of the criminal courts relies heavily on lawyers paid by the state to defend people who can’t afford their own representation. For duty solicitors, that means racing to police stations in the middle of the night to take critical decisions on behalf of often difficult, occasionally violent, clients and then slogging through the casework in return for fees that (according to a government-commissioned review) have fallen overall by up to 45% in real terms since 1996. Some junior lawyers are now effectively paying for the privilege of working, according to the London Criminal Courts Solicitors’ Association, whose members will next week start refusing to take on low-paid cases such as burglary in protest. The association’s president, Hesham Puri, a criminal legal aid solicitor himself, says that “our goodwill has run out and will no longer prop up a broken justice system”. Criminal barristers have already imposed a form of work-to-rule, refusing to take on last-minute cases returned by colleagues, which only increases delays. The lord chief justice warned this week that “more and more cases are not going ahead because either the prosecution or the defence have not been able to find an advocate”. Even court buildings themselves are starting to crumble: one sketchwriter sniffily described the courtroom in which Vardy met Rooney as somewhat “mouldy” but in some lowlier courts, clerks are putting buckets out to catch rain leaking through the roof. It’s a cliche to say of the kind of celebrity trials that end up dragging both sides through the mud – be that the Rooney-Vardy circus or the vitriolic grudge match currently being fought out between Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard – that nobody wins but the lawyers. For ordinary people caught up in Britain’s underfunded criminal justice system, however, it’s increasingly more accurate to say that nobody wins full stop. Not the victims whose agony is prolonged by delays; not defendants waiting to clear a stain from their name; not even the lawyers, apparently now voting with their feet for more lucrative work. Boris Johnson is said to be keen to focus on crime now that the Metropolitan police has finished investigating his own Covid law-breaking.

5/20/2022,"Sigmund Freud was unavailable for comment, but George W Bush saying Iraq instead of Ukraine when condemning “a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion” certainly suggests he still has a lot on his unconscious mind. The former president jokingly attributed the slip to his 75 years, but there has always been a faulty connection between his brain and his tongue. There are whole books full of “Bushisms”, like his boast that people “misunderestimated” him, and how much he felt for single mothers “working hard to put food on your family”. There may have been something Freudian about his 2004 warning that America’s enemies “never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we”. And then there was the time he was thanking an army general for his service in 2008, telling him he “really snatched defeat out of the jaws of those who are trying to defeat us in Iraq”. Bush has already told us that the fiasco of Iraq’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction still troubles him. “No one was more shocked and angry than I was when we didn’t find the weapons,” he wrote in his memoir, Decision Points. “I had a sickening feeling every time I thought about it. I still do.” But Bush sought to justify the 2003 invasion anyway, on the grounds that Saddam Hussein was a vicious despot “pursuing” weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and therefore the US was safer without him in the world. The 43rd president was making a similar argument to an audience at his presidential library in Dallas when he made his gaffe on Wednesday. Bush was making a distinction between a democratically elected Volodymyr Zelenskiy, “the Churchill of the 21st century”, and the rigged elections and despotism of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, where the absence of checks and balances led to “the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq – I mean Ukraine”. The audience laughed along, but the mistake was a reminder that the world is still living with the consequences of that invasion. It broke Iraq and set off a sectarian civil war in which hundreds of thousands of people died. Nearly two decades on, it continues to weaken the US on the world stage, and is undoubtedly a factor in the ambivalence of countries in Africa and the Middle East over joining a decisive global response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin has cynically copied from the Iraq playbook the Bush administration left behind, with spurious claims of Ukrainian WMD. The US failure to prosecute war crimes by US troops and contractors, its use of torture in the “global war on terror” and Bush’s campaign to undermine the international criminal court, all contributed to a more permissive environment for the many crimes against humanity that have followed Iraq, from Syria to Ukraine and well beyond. Wednesday’s Bushism was a reminder that for all the former president’s aw shucks self-deprecatory jokes about Iraq, it was never really funny.",News/US news,George W Bush accidentally admits Iraq war was ‘unjustified and brutal’ in gaffe,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/george-bush-iraq-ukraine-speech
