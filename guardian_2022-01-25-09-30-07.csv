1/25/2022,"Indigenous women raped by paramilitaries during Guatemala’s brutal civil war have triumphed in court, when their aggressors were sentenced to 30 years each in prison. In a verdict hailed as a vindication for survivors who have spent years fighting for justice, a tribunal convicted five former paramilitary patrolmen of crimes against humanity for the rape of five Maya Achi women in the early 1980s.  “We are very happy, very satisfied with the outcome,” said Brisna Caxaj, a sociologist and gender programme coordinator for Impunity Watch Guatemala, who accompanied the women during the trial. “The tribunal recognised the use of sexual violence during the armed conflict because it was systematic, and it also established how the army used the [paramilitaries] to commit those crimes,” Caxaj told the Guardian. The verdict is also slightly bittersweet. A group of 36 Maya Achi survivors initiated the legal proceedings that eventually led to Monday’s verdict, but three of the women died in the intervening period, including one just last week. Pedrina López, one of the five women whose cases were directly included in the trial, was only 12 years old when she was raped in Rabinal, 80km north of Guatemala City. She testified during the trial and took the stand again Monday morning to call for justice. “What happened never leaves us,” López told the courtroom on Monday morning prior to the verdict. “My body has been left with everything that happened.” López also called for paramilitaries to return the remains of her parents, who were taken away and forcibly disappeared. Other Maya Achi survivors of sexual violence witnessed massacres of relatives, including children. Guatemala’s 1960-1996 civil war left an estimated 200,000 people dead and 45,000 people disappeared. Many of the worst atrocities occurred in the early 1980s. The 36-year armed conflict was between leftist guerrilla groups and the military, but the military’s counterinsurgency campaign, which included paramilitaries, was also deployed against indigenous civilians. More than 80% of victims of atrocities were indigenous Maya civilians, according to a United Nations-backed truth commission, which also documented more than 600 massacres carried out by the military and paramilitaries. State actors committed acts of genocide in some regions of the country, including the Achi region, the truth commission concluded. A domestic court concurred in 2018, and high-ranking former military officials are facing trial for genocide. “Sexual violence was part of the war,” the three-judge tribunal affirmed in its verdict on Monday, noting sexual violence was generalised and systemic against Achi women, who were also subjected to domestic slavery. Nearly six years ago, two former military officers were convicted of crimes against humanity for the systemic rape and enslavement of 11 Maya Q’eqchi’ women in the 1980s in eastern Guatemala. That landmark case helped Achi survivors advance their own. In 2019, however, a judge originally on the Achi women’s case acquitted three paramilitary patrolmen and provisionally acquitted another three, releasing them all from custody. The men are also indigenous and some are from the same villages as the female survivors. The army recruited, often forcibly, local men into paramilitary “civil defence patrols” during the civil war. “The women were challenged by relatives of the accused, and they faced taunts and insults when the men got out,” said Lucia Xiloj, one of three indigenous female lawyers who represents the Achi women joint plaintiffs. “They have faced so many difficulties,” she told the Guardian, noting the women faced stigma in court as well as back home. The conviction is a victory for the women, and their communities will see they were heard and believed, said Xiloj. “The tribunal highlighted in its arguments the importance of the testimonies of the women,” she said. “It vindicates all those years of struggle during their search for justice.”",News/World news,Victory in court for indigenous women raped during Guatemala’s civil war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/guatemala-victory-in-court-for-indigenous-women-raped-during-civil-war
1/25/2022,"Dementia patients who see the same GP every time have lower rates of health complications, fewer emergency hospital visits and a better overall quality of life, according to a new study. More than 900,000 people live with dementia in the UK. The figure is about 57 million globally, and this is on course to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050.  The University of Exeter research – published in the British Journal of General Practice – analysed records for more than 9,000 people aged 65 and over in England living with dementia in 2016. It found that people with dementia who were consistently seen by the same GP over the course of one year were given fewer medicines and were less likely to be given medicines that can cause problems like falls, incontinence and drowsiness. Those seeing the same GP over time were 35% less likely to develop delirium, a state of confusion commonly experienced in dementia. Those who consistently saw the same GP were also 58% less likely to experience incontinence, and 10% less likely to have an emergency hospitalisation, compared with those who had the most variation in GPs treating them. Delirium and incontinence are not only very distressing for patients, but additional hospital admissions can also be costly for the NHS, the researchers said. “In the absence of a cure, long-term care is particularly important,” said the study’s lead author, Dr João Delgado of the University of Exeter. “Treating people with dementia can be complex, because it often occurs together with other common diseases. “Our research shows that seeing the same GP consistently over time is associated with improved safe prescribing and improved health outcomes. This could have important healthcare impacts, including reduced treatment costs and care needs.” Sir Denis Pereira Gray, study co-author and a GP researcher at Exeter’s St Leonard’s Practice, said the findings showed that having a named GP was associated with important benefits for patients. “Whilst national policymakers have for years discouraged continuity, general practices can still provide good GP continuity through their internal practice organisation, for example by using personal lists,” he added. Dr Richard Oakley, associate director of research at Alzheimer’s Society, said: “It’s clear from this study that consistently seeing the same GP has real benefits for people living with dementia – better management and treatment of conditions, and lower risk of complications like delirium and incontinence, leading to improved quality of life. “The pandemic has put GP services under immense pressure, so while we might not be able to get consistent GP care for everyone with dementia tomorrow, policymakers should absolutely be working with the NHS to build this into their plans as we emerge from the pandemic.” The study concluded that higher continuity of GP care for patients with dementia was “associated with safer prescribing” and “lower rates of major adverse events”. “Continuity of care is highly valued by patients and GPs, and there is strong research evidence that it is associated with better outcomes for patients and more effective use of NHS services,” said Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs. “This research confirms these findings and shows it can be particularly beneficial for patients suffering from dementia.” Marshall said although GPs wanted to provide the best care to all their patients, including continuity for those who want and value it, “escalating GP workload and workforce shortages” meant that it had become increasingly difficult to deliver. He added: “Ultimately, what is needed in order to allow GPs to deliver continuity of care to those patients who value it is more GPs and more members of the practice team so that we can spend more time with patients. The government must urgently deliver on its manifesto pledge of 6,000 more GPs and thousands more members of the practice team so that GPs are able to give patients with dementia, and all their patients, the care they need and deserve.”",News/Society,"Dementia patients who see same GP have better quality of life, study finds ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/dementia-patients-who-see-same-gp-have-better-quality-of-life-study-finds
1/25/2022,"For years company bosses have feared “doing a Ratner” when it comes to speaking their minds and have chosen empty platitudes instead. Now a group of Britain’s biggest business names have come together to urge their boardroom peers to abandon dull corporate-speak in the national interest. Senior figures including Juergen Maier, the former chief executive of Siemens UK, and Sir Charlie Mayfield, the former chairman of John Lewis, have launched an organisation to encourage business leaders to speak out about the UK’s biggest economic challenges.  Aimed at mentoring the next generation of business leaders so that their voices are heard, the group has developed an app-based platform called vocL to bring together executives who believe companies should engage more in society. Maier, known for outspoken Brexit interventions on the BBC’s Question Time, said business leaders had to stop being scared of speaking in public and recognise that failure to talk openly about politics and economics harms public debate and leaves the field open to their critics. “It’s the fear of making a mistake, and saying something that is very brand impactful. We’ve seen them before: Ratner was probably one of the worst case studies. So you go in with that fear,” he said. “But I cannot see a way in which we can solve the challenges we’ve got without a much, much stronger relationship between business and society and public sector. And I think business has to take responsibility and leadership for some of those issues.” The jeweller Gerald Ratner has gone down in British business folklore for describing his company’s own products as “crap” in a speech in 1991, turning him into a textbook example of why company chiefs should choose their words carefully. Maier said the British economy faced challenges in the recovery from Covid-19 and in tackling global heating that meant firms needed to speak more openly with their customers and the public. vocL is aimed at connecting the most senior figures in British business with aspiring company leaders. Planned to have 150 mentees enrolled this year, the group of City grandees also includes Sir Michael Rake, the former chairman of BT, Paul Drechsler, the former president of the CBI, and James Timpson, the chief executive of the Timpson shoe repair chain. Mayfield said: “Businesses play a key role in society. I hope the dialogues we stimulate will contribute to that by encouraging freer and more diverse exchanges.”",News/Business,Forget Ratner: UK bosses urged to ditch platitudes and speak out,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/forget-ratner-uk-bosses-urged-to-ditch-platitudes-and-speak-out
1/25/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of dental patients in England are to be offered weekend and evening appointments under NHS plans to tackle the backlog exacerbated by the pandemic. More than 350,000 extra dental appointments are to be made available in February and March, NHS England said, with a new £50m funding pot aimed at fuelling a dentistry “treatment blitz”.  However, senior dentistry sources said the cash was a “drop in the ocean”, with tens of millions of NHS appointments cancelled as a result of Covid-19 and the resulting backlog set to take years to clear. Some also expressed doubts about whether there would be enough staff to offer the additional appointments, since hundreds of dentists have quit the profession in the last year amid warnings that NHS dentistry is increasingly “hanging by a thread”. Millions of patients have struggled to access dental care since 2019. Some have spent weeks or months in pain as a result, and others believed they had no option but to conduct “DIY dentistry” while waiting for treatment, or felt coerced into “going private”. Under the new plans to tackle the backlog, NHS England said dentists involved in the scheme would “be paid more than a third on top of their normal sessional fee” for delivering care outside their core hours. Dentists said this could involve providing appointments as late as 10pm on weeknights, and slots being offered on Saturdays and Sundays, with children and people with learning disabilities, autism or severe mental health problems being prioritised. The chief dental officer for England, Sara Hurley, said: “Dental services are a vital part of the NHS, providing oral healthcare to all age groups, and that’s why we have taken this unprecedented action to boost NHS dental services. “The NHS is now getting key services like dentistry back to pre-pandemic levels – injecting an extra £50m into routine services will help provide checkups and treatment for hundreds and thousands of people.” The minister for primary care, Maria Caulfield, said the new funding would “urgently give more people access to vital dental care when they need it”. However, Shawn Charlwood, chair of the British Dental Association’s general dental practice committee, said the extra cash “must be just the start if we are to rebuild a service millions depend on”. He added: “After a decade of cuts, a cash-starved service risks being offered money that can’t be spent. Hard-pressed practices are working against the clock and many will struggle to find capacity ahead of April for this investment to make a difference.”",News/Society,NHS England plans dental ‘treatment blitz’ to tackle appointments backlog,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/nhs-england-dental-treatment-appointments-backlog
1/25/2022,"Swamped by teammates after finally making the breakthrough that put the Matildas on their way to a 4-0 win over the Philippines, there were no backflips or dashes to the corner from Sam Kerr, just a guttural roar. It was a primal scream that bore all the frustrations of an opening 50 minutes in which the Matildas had been banging their heads against a brick wall and an acknowledgment of the weight of expectations placed on a side now in “performance mode”.  The goal finally converted outright dominance to the only stat that actually matters, and an own goal from defender Dominique Jaylin Randle as she attempted to clear away a long Emily van Egmond ball into the box moments later made it 2-0. To that point in the contest the Philippines had been content to sit back in a well-organised defensive block, force the Matildas out wide and make them earn any half-chances through some physical play that was on the edge of what is considered acceptable. But the change in dynamic and the associated psychological blow to the Malditas from that rapid one-two punch meant more goals were almost inevitable. Alen Stajčić’s side were never likely to expose themselves by trying to chase two equalising goals – they didn’t possess the cattle do to so even if they had wanted – but the combination of fatigue and the knowledge that the dam had broken took a toll on their defensive efforts. Combined with the exciting addition of Cortnee Vine, Remy Seimsen, and Holly McNamara off the substitutes bench, the Matildas were able to finish strongly through goals to Van Egmond and Mary Fowler. “I couldn’t be any prouder of the way that they fought and battled,” Stajčić, the former Matildas boss, said. “The fight and the efforts makes us really proud that we could match that team for so long and keep them at bay.” For Australia, the job was done. Tony Gustavsson’s side have now secured progression to the knockout stages with a game in hand and an absurd +22 goal difference from their opening two games. After being made to work for it, they stuck to their guns, found a way through the Philippines and avoided a potential banana skin. “I have to give a lot of credit to the Philippines,” Gustavsson said. “I think they made it very difficult for us, they’ve done really good preparation work going into this game. “We were able to stay focused and not get frustrated. What can happen in a game like this is when you create that many chances in the first half, and the stats say that we should be up to three- to four-nil, and you don’t get those goals — you can tend to sometimes lose your head.” In examining outcomes, however, is it worth keeping in mind the processes that helped deliver them. In the case of this game, Gustavsson is correct in his summation that the stats and the Matildas’ territorial dominance suggest his side could have scored several goals in the opening half. But in turn, it is worth asking if this is down to creating quality opportunities. Or is it a case of accumulating a sufficient volume of low-quality chances and misplaced final passes that cumulatively took their toll on the Philippines, but would be punished by a higher quality opposition? No doubt the sterling efforts of the Philippines defence played a part, but how much was down to a midfield composition that once again forced the square peg that is Van Egmond into the round hole that is the No 6 role again? How much was down to the Matildas’ increasing reliance on balls down the flanks before whipping balls into the area? Kerr and Clare Polkinghorne both had clear-cut chances in the first half that would have altered the course of the game and potentially broke their opponents’ resistance much sooner. But along that very same line of thinking, how do the Matildas react if the first shot of the game – from the Philippines’ Chandler McDaniel – was not dragged across the face of goal and instead found the back of the net? Ultimately, those are hypotheticals. But with one eye now on the knockout stages and with stiffer opposition to come, the sustainability of the processes employed by the Matildas bear scrutiny.",Sport/Football,Matildas take their time but finally find a way to break Philippines dam | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/matildas-take-their-time-but-finally-find-a-way-to-break-philippines-dam

The idea that it might be handy to have an inland rail stretching across Australia has been floating around since before Australia was even a country. Four years ago, it looked like there was movement at the station, with the announcement of a 1,700km line between Brisbane and Melbourne. Then what happened? Well, we do know the infrastructure project will be worth worth $14.5bn (at least); we do not know where the line will begin. Or end. Do we know where it will middle? Kind of! In a beautiful interactive investigative feature, from Gabrielle Chan, Mike Bowers, Andy Ball and Natasha May, we visit the towns along the proposed line; finding mixed feelings about the project, and where it is headed next. Notable quote: In Euroa, Victoria, a grassroots campaign has been fighting hard to ensure the project does not split the town in two. “With large statutory organisations like ARTC, if you don’t stand up in your local community, you are literally railroaded on this,” says local independent MP Helen Haines.

Notable quote: By awarding only just four contracts to “traditionally attractive, heterosexual women” the message Blackwell received was “that Cricket Australia wanted to continue to take the image of our women’s team in a particular direction … targeted towards cricket’s existing, mostly male, fanbase” while trying “to convince mothers to sign their daughters up to cricket by showcasing the type of women cricket administrators believed mothers would want their daughters to be.” The final straw: “And yet Cricket Australia continued to put me forward as a kind of spokesperson for diversity and inclusion within the game, quite difficult and important work.
