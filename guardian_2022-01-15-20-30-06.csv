1/15/2022,"With Veganuary expected to reach more than 2 million sign-ups globally since its launch in 2014, the 31-day plant-based pledge is once again making headlines this January as food manufacturers, supermarkets and restaurants cater to the movement. But for people wanting to eat more sustainably, yet not willing to cut out meat completely, there is another consumer challenge to try: Regenuary. The idea for people to source as much food as possible from producers who use regenerative farming methods was hatched three years ago by Glen Burrows, co-founder of the Ethical Butcher, who was a vegetarian for 25 years because he didn’t like the way meat was produced. “Back in 1989, being a vegetarian was basically like being a Martian,” he says. “I became that awkward guy at dinner parties and slightly enjoyed that moral smugness, but then after a long period of time, I wasn’t that well. It wasn’t suiting me.”  So he started eating meat again. “It was like a life-force had been switched back on … I was going for my second black belt in martial arts.” He particularly likes offal. “For me, it’s almost like doing drugs.” Burrows’ aim with Regenuary is to get people thinking more about how their food is produced. “The whole point of the movement is to think more about the impact of their food choices, and stop the oversimplified narrative that all plant-based foods are better than animal-based,” he says. Unlike the fairly self-explanatory rules of Veganuary, Regenuary is more nuanced and involves eating seasonal produce from farms that proponents say have lower, or even beneficial, environmental or social impacts. This idea is gaining ground and “regenerative” may be the farming buzzword of 2022. It remains a rather broadly-defined concept – essentially it is any form of farming that simultaneously improves the environment, including in a social sense. At the Oxford Real Farming Conference (ORFC) last week, there were talks about regenerative dairy, regenerative suckler cows, regenerative fashion, the regenerative mindset, and even regenerative women. At last year’s Groundswell, the UK’s flagship event for nature-friendly farming, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said Brexit was a chance for the UK to take a lead on supporting regenerative agriculture. Farming is the biggest driver of biodiversity decline in the UK. But many farmers are anticipating the change in subsidies and starting to make ecological improvements on their farms already. But while many support the idea of regenerative farming, they argue that the priority should be to stop people eating meat. Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London, says: “While I’m supportive of regenerative agriculture and community agriculture and protecting soil, I do think Regenuary is greenwash for eating meat and drinking dairy.” Lewis says we need to be clear on the science that plant-based diets are better for the planet, and he is worried movements like Regenuary are “muddying waters” on this issue. Avoiding meat and dairy is considered to be the biggest single way someone can reduce their impact on the planet. Scientific studies show humans farm about 4.1bn hectares (10.1bn acres) of land globally, and that if we all adopted a vegan diet, just 1bn hectares would be used. This would mean more space to protect wild habitats for nature and plant trees. This is the land “sparing” approach to wildlife protection. Many regenerative farmers believe in land “sharing”, essentially that wildlife and farm animals can co-exist within more natural, lower intensity grazing systems, creating a mosaic of habitats and requiring fewer chemical inputs. At the end of last year, a poll showed more than a third of the UK public is interested in becoming vegan, with meat consumption dropping by 17% over the past decade. “People pushing Regenuary would be better to say ‘hey, when you’ve finished your Vegenuary, if you still feel you need to eat meat occasionally, you should get it from regenerative agriculture,’ rather than it being opposed to people who are exploring being vegan for a month,” says Lewis, who believes the government must make the most environmentally friendly option the cheapest and easiest one for consumers to choose. Burrows believes people should eat “better” meat, but not necessarily less of it. For him, the value in food comes from being able to see where it comes from, supporting grass-based grazing systems and getting farmers and consumers involved in short, direct supply chains. He also encourages people to move away from eating only prime cuts and to embrace snout-to-tail eating, which means less of the carcass is wasted. However, in terms of carbon emissions, science says regenerative meat-eating is only sustainable if coupled with a reduction in the total amount eaten, a fact which the UK’s farming unions are still loth to admit. Although exactly how much meat we should be eating is a movable feast, the Lancet recommends a maximum of 100g of red meat a week. Prof Sir Ian Boyd, former chief scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says sheep and cattle numbers need to drop by 90% as half the nation’s farmland needs to be converted to woodland. Other estimates have been much more conservative. The UK’s advisory body, the Climate Change Committee, is calling for people to reduce consumption by 20% by 2030, with a focus on eating “less but better” meat. Regenuary and Veganuary are both part of a growing movement of people being more conscious about the effect on the environment of food production and their supporters should be allies, not competitors, says John Lynch, a researcher on the University of Oxford’s future of food programme. “I kind of endorse much of the ‘less but better’ movement, which is if we do want to eat better meat, often, the welfare argument coming in there as well as the environmental one,” he says. Lynch believes some farmers feel they are “painted as the villain”, which means they disengage. “People are more willing to get on board if they’re not just giving up livestock farming, but they are still having some of the carbon and biodiversity benefits,” he says. Environmental efforts such as protecting soil, planting trees and restoring peatlands and wetlands are expected to be supported by future government farming subsidies. Increasingly, there are efforts to integrate trees with existing livestock and crop systems and, given agriculture takes up 70% of the UK, such efforts done on a large scale can make a big impact towards a more regenerative farming industry. Equally, among consumers, many people would not be willing to do Veganuary, but might try Regenuary and that is to be applauded, says Lynch, so long as reducing meat consumption is part of that effort. “Some people are already vegan, and they want to carry on not eating any livestock products, and that’s fine. They don’t need to have a target of eating meat once or twice a week. Whereas if you’re eating meat or dairy every single day then even if you just cut back slightly that’s still going to be a good step in the right direction,” he says.

1/15/2022,"On 2 December, the White House announced its winter plans for a likely Covid surge that would come as cold temperatures and holiday plans drove people indoors. It included an alarmingly inadequate plan to get at-home tests to people. The plan dropped nine days after scientists in South Africa had announced that they had discovered a new variant of the coronavirus, one that appeared to be even more transmissible. The US had acted quickly to ban travel from South Africa and several other southern African countries, claiming that such restrictions would “slow things down” and “buy time” for the US to prepare.  But as the days ticked closer to Christmas and New Year’s, and the inevitable surge of infections that would follow, it was difficult to see what we were buying time for. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, had scoffed at the idea of providing free tests for Americans and mailing them to homes, as many other countries have done. Instead, the administration said that 150 million Americans – less than half of the country – could be reimbursed for tests if they had insurance, if they fronted the money, if they could wait to be reimbursed, and if they didn’t buy them until mid-January. Tests purchased before the holidays would be ineligible for reimbursement. Meanwhile, tests were impossible to find in huge swathes of the country – or required standing in lines so long that they were only accessible to those who could afford what amounted to a tax on people’s time. It was a plan that was so complicated, so limited, so inadequate, and so fundamentally wrong-headed that it exemplified everything that has gone wrong with the Biden administration’s response to the coronavirus to date. A mantra of successful health campaigns is “make the healthy choice the easy choice”. But the Biden administration has been intent on making matters that should be easy difficult, prioritizing rules and regulations over results, deferring to private industry in matters of state responsibility, burdening individuals already at their breaking points, adding cumbersome barriers of time and logistics, being too slow, and displaying too much contempt and too little urgency in responding to cries for help. This week, the US shattered world records for the most coronavirus infections and hospitalizations of any country since the pandemic began. Two years into this crisis and a year into Biden’s presidency, we seem to be even worse off than we were under Trump in the most lethal metric: more deaths are taking place under the Democrat than occurred under his predecessor. What is going on? How did the richest country in the world – a country now governed by the party that allegedly “believes the science” – get here? Why have the Democrats given up on saving the lives of those they claim to represent? When he took office, Biden flooded the country with vaccines, and rightly so. The US had many advantages then: three approved, domestically produced vaccines and a Democratic president and Congress that appropriately funded getting jabs into arms via every possible lever of society. At one point, the US was vaccinating four million people in a single day. But Democrats around the country have pursued a vaccine-only strategy at times when there is simply too much virus bouncing around communities. Vaccines work best in tandem with other mitigation measures, such as ventilation, masks, distancing, and paid lockdowns when necessary, so that people encounter viruses as infrequently as possible. Biden has fought Republicans to require employers of more than 100 people to mandate vaccines or testing, a plan which the supreme court blocked in a genocidal fashion this week. But even if that protection were still in place, there were times when the president and Democratic governors and mayors should have closed worksites wherever possible. A vaccine is like a rain jacket. A good rain jacket will keep you dry in the rain, especially if you also use an umbrella and rubber boots. But if someone turns a firehose on you and points it at you for days or weeks, you’re going to get wet, even in the best rain jacket possible. That’s what’s happening right now, as many vaccinated people are getting mostly moderate, but still contagious, breakthrough infections. The US recorded 1.35 million new cases on Monday alone, to say nothing of unrecorded cases. With so many children still unvaccinated, schools should have gone remote this month for a few weeks. The federal government should have paid as many workers to stay home as possible in a short-term “circuit-break” lockdown to lower community viral loads. This has not happened. At the same time, the populations of prisons, jails and Ice detention centers – some of the most potent vectors of all – should have been reduced. This also did not happen. In mid-December, Vice-President Kamala Harris told the Los Angeles Times that the Administration hadn’t seen mutations coming. She even seemed surprised that “it turns out” that SARS-CoV-2 “has mutations and variants”. In October, the outgoing director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Francis Collins, told MSNBC that “we underestimated the vaccine hesitancy issue,” admitting: “I wish we had somehow seen that coming and come up with some kind of a myth-buster approach.” These are confounding statements from officials in an administration that has claimed it will “follow the science”. The NIH funds plenty of virologists who have long predicted mutations (and provided advice on how to deal with them), as well as sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists who have studied vaccine hesitancy (and how to deal with it). Utilizing science means changing the course of action as the conditions being studied necessitate. A common defense to justify keeping schools, prisons or job sites open through a Covid wave has been to say, “It’s not early 2020 anymore; people are vaccinated.” Some people are, but it’s not early 2021 either, when we hoped these vaccines would largely stop onward transmission. The vaccines do offer excellent individual protection, and they do seem to be decreasing onwards transmission. But how much they decrease it could change with each variant, and they don’t stop it as much as we’d hoped they might. So, when positivity rates get too high, the science says we must wear high-quality masks, distance when possible, and lock down if needed until levels drop to levels where the vaccines are most effective. (Restaurants, very dangerous worksites, should definitely be closed and their workers paid to stay home.) But Democrats in Washington, Chicago and New York keep using vaccination as justification to keep schools open as daycare centers. Is this really for our collective safety? Or to keep workers earning more wealth for the Democratic donor class? In June and July of 2021, Abbott Laboratories laid off 2,000 workers and destroyed millions of rapid Covid home tests, the New York Times reported. Demand for the tests had fallen as cases fell, and the company was making a business decision. It would only be a few weeks before the Delta variant sent demand soaring again, but by that point the tests were already gone. In its drive to optimize every inch and every second – how much did Abbott really save by not having to warehouse those tests? – US capitalism has no resources to spare for contingency plans, or the public good. Abbott destroying tests it saw no market for isn’t solely the fault of the Democrats. But if the Biden administration had been looking ahead to the winter – a time we always knew would see an increase of transmission as people moved indoors – it could have bought and stored those tests for a likely surge or, better yet, made its own and had a ready supply. In assessing the health of the nation, the Democrats fetishize “the economy” without specifying who benefits from it. Marcia Fudge, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, recently bragged on Twitter that “the United States is the only major economy in the world where the economy as a whole is stronger now than before the pandemic”. But whose economy? Google has provided its highest paid employees, who were already working remotely, with a $1,000 device so they can also perform rapid Covid tests at home. Meanwhile, shift workers must spend hours waiting to be tested for the virus they are much more likely to have been exposed to. As the ruling class has worked safely from home, having goods delivered by human shields, their wealth has increased because they are extracting value from the viral underclass, who are paying with their time on lines, their pathogenic work, and, sometimes, their very lives. I often think about how the deadliest year for Aids in the US was 1995. This was 15 years into the pandemic, and just before live-saving medications to treat HIV became available. About 50,000 people died. Last week, the United States was averaging almost 2,000 Covid deaths a day. We are churning through the same volume of death Aids caused in its worst year every five, six, seven weeks. Covid vaccines are very good at protecting individuals’ lives, and they have certainly saved a lot of them. But alone, they have not stopped US Covid deaths from surpassing the sum of 40 years of US Aids deaths in less than two years. On Thursday, the White House announced the federal government was purchasing 1bn at-home tests for distribution. That’s only three tests per American, and it’s too little, too late. By the time they are available, the Omicron surge may have come and gone. But how many infections could have been prevented if the administration had acted sooner? When experts said the national production and distribution of masks and tests was needed and other countries showed how this approach worked? And why is the administration still pushing reimbursement schemes for the insured and complicated ways to get tested rather than mailing tests home for free and giving them away wherever anyone will take them? Why are Biden and Harris both telling people to Google where to get tested, when 18% of people below the federal poverty line – those most at risk for Covid – don’t have internet access? What if the administration had spent the time and energy it spent scapegoating South Africa looking ahead to what the US needed to do domestically? What if it had actually used the time it was “buying” to buy and distribute masks and tests? I fear the administration is scared of spending money that “doesn’t do anything” – that it’s afraid to spend money on preventing catastrophes that never occur, and is more comfortable responding to tangible disasters after they’ve happened. But if neither Republicans nor Democrats are willing to look forward, be proactive and deal with the root causes of this disaster, then despite our alleged wealth, I fear the US will continue to be the country with the most infections and deaths on planet Earth.

1/15/2022,"The hellebores are coming. The early ones started flowering before Christmas; now the rest are gathering pace and will keep it up until April. In grand old gardens and smaller, newer ones, banks of them will tumble open as they drift among cyclamens and ferns and accompany bluebells, wood anemones and other lovely spring things. There are so many hellebores out there: doubles, semi-doubles, chaste-looking singles and ones with frills. Look a little closer and you’ll find speckles, spots, dots, dashes and smudges on the petals. There are glowing red clarets, duskiest pinks, sombre metallic purples, deep roses, slate blues, brilliant yellows and vivid and livid greens, not to mention foliage that can vary from dark black to silver.  The place to see them in all their glory is John Massey’s private garden, attached to Ashwood Nurseries in south Staffordshire. It produces up to 10,000 hellebores each season and reopens to the public next month (dates TBC). The truly serious can go behind the scenes with one of the nursery’s Hellebore Tours. If a visit to the Midlands is out of question, it does mail order (inter-species now, garden hybrids from February to March) from about £5, up to £80 for rarities. The eagle-eyed can grab a bargain with its online-only bundles of seedling plug plants – a very economical way to start your drift. Hellebores are not quick to bulk up; they take their time to get established. It will be a year, maybe two, before they’ve properly decided their feet are happy, then they start flowering their socks off. They are tolerant to drought and neglect, but thrive best in moist but well-drained soil. Poor drainage is the only thing they truly hate. Once settled, they will increase gloriously year on year, particularly if you feed them. They are hungry things, so mulch in late spring when the flowers are over and in autumn to fatten them up before they flower again. If you grow hellebores in containers, be aware that they drink a lot when in active growth in autumn and spring, but not when they go into non-active growth during summer. Hellebores need some sort of shade – the more open the situation, the more moisture they need in the soil. The leaves are tough and rubbery and tend to look tired by now, so remove any of last year’s leaves to make way for the new growth and flowers. Once the flowers are over, remove the seed heads unless you want hundreds of seedlings. These will be in muddy colours, and it will take you at least three years to find this out, so it is easier to prevent this and force the plant to concentrate on next year’s flowers rather than this year’s seed.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Give hellebores the time and they’ll flower their pretty little socks off | Alys Fowler,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/give-hellebores-the-time-and-theyll-flower-their-socks-off-until-april
1/15/2022,"It was only 12 years ago that Harry Styles took the day off from his job at a bakery in Cheshire, north-west England, to go and sing Stevie Wonder’s Isn’t She Lovely for Simon Cowell at an entirely unremarkable audition for The X Factor. This week, it was announced that he would be joining Billie Eilish and Ye (the artist formerly known as Kanye West) as one of the three headliners of Coachella 2022 – marking the end of a decade of an incredible transition from boyband heartthrob to credible rockstar. Other acts announced include Phoebe Bridgers, 21 Savage, Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Baby, Doja Cat and Maggie Rogers.  It must be a pinch-me moment for Styles, who like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé before him, has found that sweet spot between critical acclaim and mass popularity. To play in the Indio desert, known for its psychedelic culture and heavy magic mushroom use, will be the icing on the cake. Festival lineups are not curated out of thin air, they are painstakingly put together – in a New Yorker profile the Coachella boss Paul Tollett discussed the vast array of metrics he studies to decide not just who gets booked, but who gets to be in larger font on the poster. The final lineup is a reflection of what audiences want and where promoters believe music is heading. It’s no surprise there are very few bands on the bill. Bands have slowly been erased from most metrics of popular music over the past half-decade, as solo artists with big Instagram followings and a powerful sense of image take over. The lineup page on the Coachella website could easily be mistaken for the directory of a modelling agency. Spotify publishes its top five most streamed artists each year and there hasn’t been a band in the mix since 2016 (when US duo Twenty One Pilots squeaked it in at number four). Among the top 20 most popular artists on the streaming service this month, the only non-solo artists are Coldplay and Imagine Dragons. But on festival bills and in concert arenas bands have maintained some dominance – Rage Against the Machine, Tame Impala, Radiohead, The Killers, Arctic Monkeys, Metallica, Wolf Alice and Foo Fighters have remained dominant. This year not only are none of the headliners bands, but neither are any of the 20-odd acts in the tier below, with the exception of the Mexican banda artists Groupo Firme and Banda MS – both exciting groups with record-breaking stints on the Billboard 100 for Mexican artists but, with their heavy use of woodwind, not typical festival rockers. While the traditional rock band may have fallen from favor, the ascent of Styles suggests something rising from its ashes. He is arguably the most successful indie musician in years – his album draws on Laurel Canyon classic rock and Pitchfork favourites such as Phoenix and M83. His tours centre musicianship and the traditional band set-up. Styles, like Eilish and Ye, has found a way to make interesting music in a culture obsessed with personal brand and influence. He’s an actor, a TV host (he often fills in for James Corden when Corden is off on the Late Late show) and one of the most followed people on Instagram. He acts like a celebrity, yet the music he’s making, influenced by Peter Gabriel and Crosby, Stills & Nash, is part of the traditional rock canon. He’s indie without any independence, a rock band while being a solo artist, jumping through the hoops of what it takes to become a headline act in 2022. By riding the wave of influence and image that’s driven popular culture over the past decade, he’s become arguably the biggest rock artist working today. Ye was in some ways a pioneer, constantly trying to move back and forth between music, fashion and celebrity, furiously fighting for a seat at every table. During Trump’s presidency, West’s brand seemed to be under threat but the Coachella lineup suggests he’s been forgiven for his Maga support and his comments on TMZ in 2018 that slavery “sounds like a choice”. Around that time, influential figures in hip-hop radio including Hot 97 host Ebro, and Shay Shay and BiGG from Detroit’s The Bounce promised to boycott Ye. Those boycotts appear to have faded and after a critically acclaimed album, Ye is back in favour. But perhaps the most radical thing about the Coachella lineup is how little reverence it has for what’s gone before. Ten years ago Coachella was still obsessed with the golden oldies – the 2012 festival had Madness, Jimmy Cliff, Dr Dre, Buzzcocks, Pulp, Noel Gallagher and Squeeze dotted through the lineup. This time around that sense of indebtedness to heritage acts has almost completely disappeared. The only acts on the 2022 bill that were releasing albums in the 90s are Spiritualized, Fatboy Slim and film composer Danny Elfman. A much greater chunk of the acts on the lineup weren’t even born in the 90s. Eilish, aged 21, will be the festival’s youngest headliner ever, and is reflective of a lineup that has managed gender balance without making a song and dance about it. For years people complained about the same old headliners playing every year – this feels like a new starting point for live music.",Arts/Music,Harry Styles headlining Coachella is a triumph of music’s influencer era,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/15/harry-styles-headlining-coachella-music-festival-influencer-era
1/15/2022,"Ido not write historical fiction. But I envy those who do. I can picture them sitting in the lamp-lit halls of the New York Public Library on 42nd Street, thumbing through fraying, early 20th‑century telephone directories or spinning the roulette of the microfiche machine, or meeting at a nearby coffee dispensary with fellow history-minded wordsmiths in the wee hours of the day, like hunters getting ready to put a bullet through the heart of a wildebeest. The best are able to address the current moment through deft metaphysical journeys between the present and the past, to illuminate our wayward realities by reminding us that it has ever been so, that the past is not even the past, or whatever Faulkner said. Personally, I have trouble building a literary time machine. A decade ago, when I wrote a memoir set primarily in the 1980s, all I could remember of that era was Michael J Fox running around in a varsity jacket. The rest of my memories were just volumes of mist that sometimes trickled out of my minor brain holes, tantalising but highly suspect emissions that bore news of events which may or may not have been. When one’s teenage years are a distant Greek island, imagine trying to write a novel about the romantic entanglements of the Italian futurists or the political cataclysms of Meiji-era Japan, or anything at all about the ancient Egyptians.  As a child of two failing superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, I have always found myself in a maximal historical position. The headlines of the newspapers, whether Pravda or the New York Times, were always screaming about events on a global scale. There was no “Local Drive-In Theater to Feature Annual Jaws Marathon” or “Piggly Wiggly 5k Marathon Nets Hearts and Dollars for Muscular Dystrophy Research”. It was all “The Struggle Continues, Angola Will Win”, or our Marines lying dead in the rubble of Beirut. For as long as I’ve been alive, I have been, like the character of John Self in Martin Amis’s Money, addicted to the present. And writing about the perfidy, the hubris, the insanity of these two large, imploding imperial suns, the US and USSR, in something like real time has been my mandate from the start. My first novel, written as a five-year-old and paid for in pieces of glossy Soviet cheese by my literature-obsessed grandmother, concerned Lenin meeting a magical socialist goose and conquering Finland. The rest of my work has pretty much followed suit. When the pandemic first hit, I had been writing a humour-forward dystopian novel in which New York University had taken over most of Manhattan, building walls and checkpoints round the island, and deputising its own military force, the Violet Helmets (violet is one of the school’s colours), to keep out the non-matriculated. Come March 2020, reality rushed over the draft of my funny dystopia in waves. Once people started dying and our president continued lying, I realised the smallness of my attempted novel, the way the academic satire seemed much too easy and glib. I had undershot my historical mandate and had to make amends immediately. I trashed 240 pages of NYU conquering Manhattan and began to write a tight Chekhovian take on the disaster at hand, a novel with the simple title Our Country Friends. The importance of the moment presented itself right away. My first novel looked at the world through the prism of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the immigrants who had washed ashore on the other side of the Atlantic; my second through the prism of oil politics and American foreign policy. My third examined the advent of tech as the ultimate arbiter of American society (and the death of its democracy); my fourth the way America had become fully financialised by a class of useless and clueless meritocrats. I had always hovered around the present moment, a few years behind it or, in the case of my third novel, Super Sad True Love Story, slightly ahead of it. That book was recently mentioned in the pages of this newspaper in an article about how banks such as Lloyds and NatWest have demanded the firing of faculty staff at London’s Goldsmiths art college – in Super Sad, the school has been rebranded as HSBC-Goldsmiths and offers double qualifications in finance and art. With Our Country Friends, I began running after the present like an elderly terrier pursuing a turkey meatball rolling down a minor hill, huffing and puffing after the object of its desire. I saw the pandemic as a reflection of American decline writ large, the way our individualism and distrust (and racism and ingrained ignorance) made us useless in the face of calamity. I wanted to capture it all, but within the confines of a small, character-driven work set in the countryside. But how confined could I make my novel? I couldn’t ignore the murder of George Floyd, for instance, and the resulting fascist counternarratives. But at the same time I couldn’t let the headlines dominate. I wanted to write about a group of friends clinging to each other for survival in a Decameron-like country setting, not about a president telling his citizens to drink bleach. The particular horror of the moment required tenderness, not satire. Whether you looked at the clown formerly inhabiting the White House or the poof of hair still haunting 10 Downing Street, the satire was already built in. When I told my writer friends I was writing about the pandemic, they were worried for me. Who would want to reach for such a book after experiencing the pandemic first-hand? The UK publisher of my previous two books declined to publish Our Country Friends, citing Covid fatigue as the main reason (it will be published in the UK by Atlantic this month). But as a writer who has taken the present moment as his mandate, there was no way for me to look away. To write about the world today is to confront a never-ending series of calamities strung together like a set of exploding Christmas lights. In the past year, in America alone we have experienced an attempted coup instigated by our president, a series of attacks on Asian Americans prompted at least partly by vitriol coming from the same man (this forms one of the narratives in Our Country Friends, where half the characters are of Asian descent), forest fires that have singed parts of California and coloured our skies apocalyptic orange as far away as New York, heatwaves that have struck the Pacific north-west with unheard of brutality, killing the vulnerable and the old. And, yes, more than 800,000 pandemic deaths and counting. How should fiction deal with all of this? Should it deal with all of this? The pandemic is not going away. Many Americans, including my relations, drunk on misinformation, will never get vaccinated. The political will to truly combat climate change comes and goes with each new administration, and by the time wealthy nations truly decide to reverse course, it will almost certainly be too late. Populist, crypto-fascist movements such as the post-pretence, white-supremacist-aligned Republican party will continue to thrive across the world, and will form new commonwealths of illiberal states to circumvent the opprobrium and sanctions of the few remaining democratic ones. As the ecological order collapses, migrants from the global south, most vulnerable to the devastation, will continue to stake the survival of their families on moving north, reinforcing the cycles of authoritarian far-right despots who will capitalise on their plight. Again, what are we as writers to do? A re-creation of Chekhov’s play Uncle Vanya plays a part in Our Country Friends, and as I was rereading his work, I remembered that as far back as the late 19th century the Russian master was writing about his country’s ecology, the disappearance of its great forests beneath the logger’s saw. None of the themes I’ve described above, from authoritarianism to plagues to burning forests, is new, and yet their intensity will increase with every suffocating summer and deathly hurricane, every stolen election and misinformed electorate. The writer of the present or the near-distant future (increasingly, they are one and the same) may wish to consider two strategies. First, focus on the personal, the micro-detailed, the human. We are all small individuals kicked ass-first on to the stage of history, given terrible lines and worse costumes; but what remain interesting are the few things we cling to, the self-expressions of grieving and desire, the inability to define love. Beneath the ever-growing historical calamities that define my fiction, my first novel was, at heart, about a son aching for his mother’s love; my second about a son wanting the same from his father; my third about two lovers unprepared for the dictates of their own hearts; my fourth about a father trying to love a son … and so on, in an endless permutation of ecstatic sadness. Take away the history, and I’ve got a bunch of small, furry immigrants bumbling away against a green screen. Overamplify the history, and it’s hard to remember why you’re reading the book as opposed to clicking through some very strident think pieces. Second, entertain. I don’t have the strength to read a boring novel, even if the blurb on the back cover is shouting about its urgency. A writer is not a thinktank. The collapse of humanity is as deathly funny as it is heart-rending, like watching a drunk beaver claw its way out of a collapsed dam. If I’m going to see members of my son’s generation being burned like ants beneath the super-sun, I at least want the flicker of a smile along with my last drawn breath. And then, if any of them survive (oh, please God, let it be so), and reconstitute themselves in the last livable parts of Canada or Novaya Zemlya, let our chronicles of the present remind them of both their ancestors’ stupidity and their infrequent but sometimes moving moments of grace. Let there be a record of all we have wrought and all we have endured. And maybe, as they suck on the last of a melting, penguin-flavoured iceberg, let them try to remember what laughter once sounded like.

1/15/2022,"It’s very common to make a bean, chickpea or lentil stew at least once a week in Spain – we Spaniards love our pulses, and there’s nothing quite as comforting in the colder months. Today’s fishy recipes are quite traditional, especially the suquet, which is a real feast and the type of dish that’s perfect for a special occasion. They’re much lighter and quicker than meat stews, but they’re still incredibly warming and good for scooping up with a spoon.  Prep 20 minCook 1 hr 20 minServes 4-6 1kg clams1 tbsp fine sea salt, to clean the clams (see method)75ml extra-virgin olive oil5 garlic cloves, peeled and diced2 onions, peeled and diced1 leek, white part only, chopped1 green pepper, stalk, pith and seeds removed, flesh diced1 red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds removed, flesh diced1 bay leaf2 dried chillies, finely chopped200ml white wine1½-2 litres prawn stock (or shellfish or fish stock)500g dried haricot beans, soaked overnight in cold waterSea salt and black pepper½ bunch chervil, chopped, or dill or tarragon Check with your fishmonger whether the clams have been cleaned – if not, you’ll need to do so yourself by putting them in a bowl of cold water with a tablespoon of fine salt and soaking for 40 minutes. Gently move the clams around in the water every 10 minutes: the salt water makes them expel any sand. Put the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-low heat. Once it’s hot, add the garlic and onions, and saute, stirring, for 10-12 minutes. Add the leek, fry, stirring, for five to six minutes, then add the peppers, bay leaf and dried chillies, and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until really soft and sweet but not coloured. Pour in the wine, cook until the liquid has evaporated, then add the stock and the drained beans. Half-cover the pot with a lid, and leave to cook very gently for about 45 minutes, until the beans have soaked up lots of the stock and are nice and soft; if at this stage the beans are still a little hard, add extra water and carry on cooking until they soften. When the beans are done, season the mix, then drain the clams and add them to the pot. Half-cover the pan again, and cook the clams over a medium heat for three or four minutes, until they open (discard any that do not). Stir in the chervil, then taste and adjust the seasoning and serve with lots of bread for mopping up the sauce.

In a mortar, crush the parsley, garlic and nuts with a drizzle of olive oil until you have a rough paste, then set aside. Now start on the stew. Pour the oil into a large pan over a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until slightly golden. Add the chopped tomatoes and saute, stirring every now and then, for about 10 minutes more, until the mix reduces to a paste. Add the saffron, pimentón and picada, cook, stirring, for a minute, then add the wine, brandy, sherry and pastis, and cook until all the liquid evaporates. Add the potatoes, stir for a minute, then add the stock and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Add the chopped fish, half-cover the pot, and leave to cook for five to seven minutes, until the fish is just cooked through. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning accordingly. Meanwhile, in a medium frying pan, fry the bread slices in a drizzle of olive oil until golden on both sides. Remove from the pan, rub one side of the toast with the halved garlic and serve alongside the hot stew.

1/15/2022,"“Ihave been doing this for 14 years,” Andrew Faris half yells down the phone over the rush of noise behind him. Volunteers at his charity are preparing dinners for homeless people – veggie curry and chicken wings. “People ask me: do you ever take a day off? But there’s still so much to be done.” Faris, who tells me he is in his late 40s, runs a small, London-based charity called Rhythms of Life. The former photographer takes no salary and has put his life savings, about £70,000, into it. (The charity also receives donations.)  For Faris, this work is personal. He was homeless for six years in the 1990s. He had run a successful commercial lettings business, but overleveraged himself and went broke. His first night sleeping rough was terrible, he says. He sat and thought, “No, I won’t do silly things. I will get through this.” There is so much to think about when sleeping rough. Where will you shower? Where will you wash your clothes? How will you find something to eat? Faris didn’t even have a sleeping bag. He asked other homeless people and they sent him to a nearby shelter. “Every day, you repeat the whole episode,” he says. “Get up and go to a shelter. Get your clothes washed and have a shower. Have some cheap coffee and powdered milk and bread that has gone off.” Most homeless people have a spot they favour. Faris’s was behind the Savoy Hotel, where there were some bushes he would conceal himself in. It’s best to make yourself inconspicuous. The general public can be cruel, especially people who are drunk. “Stag parties would tie your shoelaces, pour lighter fluid on your shoes and set them alight,” says Faris. “You’d wake up with your feet tied together and burning at the same time.” A woman once urinated on him. “It was a dare,” he explains, “among a group of girls. I woke up in disgust and felt bad for myself that this had happened.” But abusive drunks weren’t the worst thing about being homeless. “Being nobody is the worst thing,” he says. “Nobody says hello. That’s what I missed the most. I wasn’t acknowledged as a human being.” Eventually he found work selling The Big Issue, and then on a market stall. He saved enough money to buy a camera and become a photographer. Six years later, by the 2000s, he was no longer homeless and his career was thriving. But he kept thinking about the people he’d left behind on the streets. In day centres for the homeless, he says, the vibe is usually negative – food bad, staff uninterested. Faris realised that he knew more than most about what homeless people really needed, and so set up Rhythms of Life in 2008. He and his team of 40 volunteers distribute food to homeless people four days a week; two days a week, he goes to domestic abuse shelters. It’s not uncommon for queues of up to 150 people to form in Trafalgar Square for his food. “We do it with passion,” he says. “We know their names. We make sure they have tea and cake in the queue while they wait.” Faris collects leftover food from supermarkets most evenings, and spends the following day preparing meals. “Andrew is the most selfless, dedicated man I have ever met,” says volunteer Frazier Stroud. “He has delivered food, support, employment opportunities and care to homeless people across London and, to my knowledge, has never taken a day off.” Faris’s team also try to empower people to get off the streets. “We do 10-week courses,” he says, “where we teach IT, English and life skills like how to open a bank account or try to reduce your drug and alcohol consumption.” Sometimes homeless people are offered volunteer positions with the charity – if they perform reliably, Faris will give them a reference and vouch for them to future employers. Faris is an incorrigible workaholic. When I try to ask him about his treat, calls go unanswered and texts unread. Eventually, after months of being pestered, he suggests one thing that would improve his life: an iPad to use when making presentations about Rhythms of Life to potential donors. His laptop is battered and slow. He has a big funding meeting coming up which will determine whether he’s able to hire a bus to take a group sightseeing around London, and for a special meal. AO.com provides Faris with a new, top-of-the-range iPad just in time for his big meeting. He uses it to show executives photographs of people queueing for meals, and statistics about how many people they’ve served. “They were impressed,” he says. He plans to use the iPad to collect data about clients’ needs in real time, from shoe sizes to training needs. And with that, a streamlined, more efficient Faris bids me goodbye: he has more mouths to feed, and places to be. “It’s all good,” he concludes, no doubt already thinking about preparing the next dinner.

1/15/2022,"Keir Starmer has ramped up the pressure on Boris Johnson as the prime minister fights to save his job, arguing that the stream of explosive allegations of Downing Street parties has left him “unable to lead”. In a speech to the Fabian Society conference, the Labour leader accused the Conservatives of running the NHS into the ground because they are “too preoccupied defending his rule breaking”. Stressing that “waiting times were the shortest on record” when Labour left government 12 years ago, he said: “Rather than concentrating on getting through the pandemic and bringing down waiting lists, this self-indulgent Tory party is instead having a fight about a leader who they should have known from the start is not fit for office.”  “We are witnessing the broken spectacle of a prime minister mired in deceit and deception, unable to lead.” The opposition is not alone in calling for Johnson to step down over rule-breaking following his public apology to the Queen on Friday for the parties that took place on the eve of her husband’s funeral. On Saturday Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, , said that “we need leadership” and Johnson must “lead or step aside”. Asked about the emerging claims of regular “wine-time Friday” gatherings in No 10 despite restrictions, Andrew Bridgdn, the MP for North West Leicestershire and a former Johnson ally, repeated his calls for the PM to resign, telling BBC Breakfast: “It doesn’t matter whether the prime minster was present or not present – ultimately, he is responsible for what goes on in the government, he’s responsible for the culture in No 10 and what we’re seeing is a culture where there’s one rule for them and the rest of us do what we’re told.” He later told Sky News Johnson’s future as prime minister was “untenable”. He said there was a “pattern of behaviour that the inner circle can do what they want and the rest of us have to what we are told”. “The prime minister needs to do the honourable thing and call it a day for the good of the country.” The claims of end-of-week drinks being held during a time when indoor household mixing was prohibited were reported on Friday evening by the Mirror, which reported that Johnson knew about the socialising and that staff invested in a special drinks fridge. A No 10 spokeswoman said: “There is an ongoing investigation to establish the facts around the nature of gatherings, including attendance, setting and the purpose with reference to adherence to the guidance at the time. The findings will be made public in due course.” However, the prime minister is reportedly preparing a plan to stay in the job in which top officials may be sacked in place of Johnson. First reported by the Independent, the drive has been dubbed “Operation Save Big Dog” by Johnson himself, and could involve his chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, and his private secretary and author of the infamous “BYOB” email, Martin Reynolds, asked to take the hit for the ongoing scandal, which has caused the Tories to plunge in the polls. The relaxation of Covid restrictions is another avenue being considered by Johnson in the fight to salvage his position. The prime minister has been in contact with political strategist Lynton Crosby, according to a report in the Telegraph, and will seek to limit the fallout from “partygate” by lifting plan B measures, such as work from home guidance, at the end of the month. The restrictions are due to expire on 26 January subject to a review.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson ‘mired in deceit’ and unable to lead, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/15/boris-johnson-mired-in-deceit-and-unable-to-lead-says-keir-starmer
