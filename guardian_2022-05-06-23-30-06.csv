5/6/2022,"Although he led one of Britain’s largest police forces for 15 years, it is as “God’s copper” that Sir James Anderton, who has died aged 89, will be best remembered. His claims that he had divine guidance in his policing duties and his inflammatory remarks about gay people ensured that he became, for a while, the most controversial police officer in Britain. At the height of the Aids crisis in the 1980s, Anderton, then chief constable of Greater Manchester, outraged many by describing gay people as “swirling around in a cesspit of their own making” and suggesting that “sodomy in males ought to be against the law”. He advocated castration for rapists and urged a return to corporal punishment so that offenders could be thrashed until “they repent of their sins”. Anderton made it clear that he felt answerable to a higher authority than the Home Office. “God works in mysterious ways,” he said. “Given my love of God and my belief in God and Jesus Christ, I have to accept that I may well be used by God.” Thus was born “God’s copper”, a figure of mockery to some, a bastion of old-fashioned values to others. The nickname became enshrined in popular culture when the Salford band Happy Mondays recorded God’s Cop. Born in Wigan, the son of a miner, also called James, and his wife, Lucy (nee Occleshaw), Anderton left Wigan grammar school at 16 to work as a coal board clerk until national service in the military police. He joined the civilian side in what was then Manchester city police in 1953. Even early in his career, which included time as a beat officer in Manchester’s red light district, Anderton was known as “Bible Jim” because of his frequent references to God and Christ. Having taken a course in criminology at the Victoria University of Manchester, he was tipped early on for high office. He served in Cheshire, Leicestershire and then in the inspectorate of constabulary in London before becoming chief constable of Greater Manchester at the age of 44, a role he held from 1976 to 1991 and which took him on to the national stage. He was soon known for praying in the back of his car as his police driver chauffeured him to work, and one of his first symbolic acts was a crackdown on pornography and prostitution in Manchester. Nearly 300 bookshops and newsagents were raided and tens of thousands of magazines seized. It was this moral zeal that was to define his career. Eccentric in many ways, he made a record of his dreams and believed that even when he was asleep, God was sending him messages. His religious path took him from a devout Church of England childhood to Methodism and then to Roman Catholicism, and he had an audience with the pope in Manchester in 1982. He first got to know his wife, Joan Baron, through their shared interest in the evangelical Christian Endeavour Movement in the early 1950s. While Anderton introduced some new ideas on policing to Britain, such as using undercover officers as decoys to catch muggers, he soon became better known for his public pronouncements than for his innovations. He called the 1984-85 miners’ strike the work of a “politically motivated industrial mafia” and frequently dismissed his critics as “subversives”, portraying the police as the last line in the defence of democracy. It was in 1986 that he made his remarks about Aids and gay people, claiming that he was channelling God when he spoke – and later telling a BBC interviewer that “if Jesus were here today, he may well have spoken in terms similar to the ones I used”. There was a huge backlash, which he dismissed as the response of “moral lepers”. However, the furore did not halt his passage to the presidency of the Association of Chief Police Officers, although many fellow officers by now found him an embarrassment. Anderton was aware of the reaction, although he claimed that his own officers saw him as a cross between the American evangelist Billy Graham and Oliver Cromwell. The following year he stirred fresh controversy by telling Woman’s Own magazine that “corporal punishment should be administered so that [offenders] actually beg for mercy”. Anderton also clashed with his Manchester deputy, John Stalker, during the latter’s inquiry into allegations of a shoot-to-kill policy operated by the British army and Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland. The inquiry eventually came to nothing after allegations of murky, behind-the-scenes action to derail it. Stalker was suspended while his relations with a Manchester businessman were investigated, and although he was exonerated and reinstated, it was felt by many of his colleagues that he had been shabbily treated by Anderton. Anderton always enjoyed the strong support of the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, who defended him behind the scenes. Documents revealed by the Manchester Evening News in 2012 showed that Thatcher had personally suggested it would be “outrageous” if Anderton had to clear his public statements with the Greater Manchester police committee, who had asked him to temper his comments. The documents also showed that Sir Lawrence Byford, the chief inspector of constabulary, reported that Anderton had “brought ridicule” on the police service. While the prime minister’s support may have helped him remain in post (and he was knighted in 1990), his remarks almost certainly cost Anderton the chance of taking the top job of commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Unrepentant, he continued his pronouncements and, when he grew a thick beard, appeared more than ever to be modelling himself on an Old Testament prophet. In retirement Anderton gave his time and support to the Salvation Army, the Boys’ Brigade, the Scouts and various Christian charities. He also worked with young offenders, was a keen gardener, and continued to write poetry, as he had throughout his life. He is survived by Joan, whom he married in 1955, and their daughter, Gillian.

5/6/2022,"War-torn Ukraine is the favourite to win next week’s Eurovision song contest, which is being hosted by Italy for the first time in more than 30 years. Kalush Orchestra, a band that blends traditional folk and hip-hop, is competing in the event with the song Stefania, which has become an anthem at home. Written by frontman Oleh Psiuk as a tribute to his mother, Stefania is also the most watched on YouTube among the 35 contenders. In an interview with the Italian news agency Ansa, Psiuk said his band’s entry was tipped to do well even before Russia invaded in February. “Some people are saying we could win because of the war, but our song was among the five favourites before the start of the conflict, which means people like it regardless,” he said. Kalush Orchestra, a six-person band, was given special permission to travel to the northern Italian city of Turin, which is hosting the competition on 10-14 May, although Psiuk said one band member stayed in Ukraine to fight. “Those of us here represent every Ukrainian,” he said. “After Eurovision we will return home to provide our contribution.” On Stefania being dedicated to his mother, he said: “This is the best thing I have ever done for her; and with the outbreak of war the meaning is extended to all mothers who protect their children.” Russia is banned from competing in this year’s event after organisers said its participation could bring the contest into disrepute. Eurovision, now in its 66th year, is being held in Italy for the first time in 31 years thanks to the Italian glam pop band Måneskin, who won the 2021 event with a show-stopping performance of Zitti e Buoni. The band from Rome enjoyed success since, including supporting the Rolling Stones at a concert in the US in November. A Ukrainian girl emerged from a coma at the CTO hospital in Turin after listening to Måneskin, Ansa reported on Friday. The 16-year-old refugee was involved in a car crash that killed her father as they tried to flee Ukraine. “She is a great fan of theirs and last night, listening to one of their songs, she expressed her emotion,” said Maurizio Beatrici, the director of the hospital’s neuro-rehabilitation unit. The UK’s entry, Sam Ryder with the song Spaceman, is also expected to perform well, as is the Italian song Brividi, performed by the duo Mahmood & Blanco.",Arts/Television & radio,Ukraine’s entry is favourite to win Eurovision song contest,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/ukraine-entry-favourite-win-eurovision-song-contest-kalush-orchestra
5/6/2022,"The mother of a 14-year-old boy stabbed to death in Birmingham last year said the “justice system has let me down”, after a teenager was sentenced to six years and six months in detention for his killing. The 15-year-old defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons due to his age, was acquitted of murder but found guilty of manslaughter following a trial that heard he was part of a group who had “hunted down” Dea-John Reid in May last year. The victim’s mother, Joan Morris, said she felt her son had been “hunted by a lynch mob reminiscent of a scene from Mississippi Burning”. Passing sentence at Birmingham crown court on Friday, Mr Justice Johnson said Dea-John “stood no chance” against the defendant, who was responsible for the fatal stab wound. “He was unarmed, he was no threat to you,” he said. “The CCTV shows that there was a concerted chase of Dea-John, which was led by you. If an adult did what you did then that would almost certainly be murder and they would be sentenced to life imprisonment.” The defendant will serve half his sentence in custody, the judge said, after earlier rejecting an application to lift an order protecting the identity of the boy. He stood trial alongside George Khan, 39, Michael Shields, 36, and two teenagers aged 15 and 16, who were all acquitted of murder. In a statement read out in court, Morris said: “The verdict of manslaughter, while all the others are found not guilty, just goes to prove to me that the life of Dea-John Reid, my son, a young black man, doesn’t matter. “I was told that justice will prevail, and I put my trust in the system, but I do sincerely believe that this system has let me down.” Speaking outside court, Bishop Desmond Jaddoo, a community activist and spokesperson for Dea-John’s family, said a “Justice for Dea-John Reid” campaign would be launching soon. “This trial has raised more questions than answers,” he said. “While welcoming that someone has been held to account for causing Dea-John’s death, it tells us how this system is not geared up to give black people justice.” During the trial, the prosecutor, Richard Wormald QC, said on 31 May 2021 the group of five had behaved “like a pack chasing down their prey” as they carried out a “revenge attack” for an incident earlier in the day, in which Dea-John was part of a group who tried to rob the 16-year-old defendant. The jury rejected the defendant’s claims he had been acting in self-defence, with the judge saying “earlier events provided a motive but did not amount to immediate provocation”. Dea-John was subjected to racist abuse by some members of the group before his death, with one member calling for him to be “banged out”. “His civil rights were completely abused,” said Jaddoo. “We have been told that we have no recourse to deal with that.” Footage of the moment Dea-John was attacked, on a busy road in Kingstanding, north Birmingham, in broad daylight, showed him being chased before stopping after running out of breath. The defendant, wearing a balaclava and gloves, stabbed Dea-John using a kitchen knife he had taken from a friend’s house. Dea-John was killed by a single stab wound to the chest that punctured his heart . He died at the scene. Hundreds of people attended a vigil in the days after the attack, which inflamed community tensions after reports of the racial abuse directed at Dea-John before his killing.",News/UK news,Dea-John Reid’s mother says ‘justice system has let me down’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/06/dea-john-reid-mother-says-justice-system-has-let-me-down
5/6/2022,"Boris Johnson has said the Conservatives took “tough” losses in the local elections, as Labour won key London seats and the Lib Dems and Greens made gains. Results in Scotland and Wales have started to come in and in Northern Ireland the results are expected from mid-afternoon. Here five people in England share their reaction to the results so far and speak about the factors that decided their vote. This time I voted Green locally, although I usually vote Labour. I feel the world’s problems are so beyond my control and this government infuriates me every day, so I decided to think very locally. The Greens have been quite active in my ward, Central St Leonards. They’ve organised street cleaning parties and community events and are just involved in a way that I haven’t picked up from the Labour party for a long time. They have been cruising along, I think. It’s been the same people in control for years. Meanwhile, the Greens were knocking on doors and introducing themselves. I know it’s either Labour or Tories nationally, so I usually vote Labour at general elections to try and keep the Tories out. But I’m an environmentalist and the new Green candidate is active and visible. He’s woken people up and even if he doesn’t win it may shake up the Labour party locally. Sally Walton, 70, artist and radio DJ, St Leonards-on-Sea (Hastings – not yet declared) I live in Westminster and used to vote Tory until about 10 years ago when I felt they were failing to control capitalism and take global warming seriously. I loathe the whole party now and am absolutely appalled by their behaviour and aggression. It’s horrific. There’s so much to complain about – the corruption, lies and cronyism. Even Brexit was a huge nail in the coffin. I voted Labour during the local election this year in what was both a protest vote but also because I like [Keir] Starmer. He’s not charismatic and he’s low-profile but I like that and I believe the Labour party is righting the ship of state. I’m delighted that Westminster is now Labour – I will never vote Tory again. Alaric, retired scientist, London (Westminster council – Con to Lab) I voted on local issues and to record dissatisfaction with the current government. Our local councillor is a Tory. He has been very effective and responsive to local people. However, I voted for the Lib Dem candidate since I could not bring myself to register a vote for Boris Johnson’s government. Although the Lib Dem position on local housing development is not as strong as the Tory one, they represent the most palatable policies. I find myself getting more engaged in politics as I get older. I am pleased that the Tories have lost control in a number of areas, and more so that the party seems to now be acknowledging the problem they have at the top. How the government has stayed together this long is completely beyond me – if ministers had any integrity, they would have resigned en masse long ago. David Woodhead, 65, management consultant, Hartley Wintney, Hampshire (Hart – no overall control, hold) This is my first time voting in Wandsworth as I just moved, so I was definitely influenced by national politics more than local. Climate change is always the priority for me and I don’t think the Conservatives are acting to safeguard our future. I would love to see a more ambitious Labour party who is more in touch with the issues the public care about. I think it’s important that Keir Starmer takes a stronger stance on issues so that people can see what he stands for. I’ll always vote Labour over Conservative, but I find he’s a bit of a flip-flopper. Climate change is a priority for me and it’s important that we see strong implementation on net zero pledges. To be honest, neither party is all that convincing. I voted Labour this year. I flit between them and the Greens, but this time my reasoning was purely strategic. I wanted to see the Conservatives out. Annabel Rice, 24, works in climate change policy for a city network, London (Wandsworth – Con to Lab) I want a councillor who lives here and canvases local opinion and then takes up the issues until they are solved. So my vote went to someone who represents my least loved party, the Conservatives, but who has an excellent track record locally. The candidate is actively looking at traffic issues, parks and green space areas, as well as allotments in her ward. The Labour party present a new candidate for every election, local or national, whom we have never heard of and promises a (vague) new future, whereas the Tory incumbent MP has a great agent who gets him mentioned in every issue of the local paper doing “good works”. So who do we think of at the ballot box? No wonder we are a safe seat. I’ve disregarded my national inclinations (Labour) and voted local (Tory). Same old, same old.

5/6/2022,"A Berlin museum dedicated to German-Russian relations on the site where the Nazis agreed to unconditionally surrender in 1945 is to drop the word “Russian” from its name before anniversary events to mark the end of the second world war in Europe. With tensions already high in the lead-up to the 77th anniversary on 8 and 9 May of Nazi Germany signing the surrender agreement, the German-Russian museum’s director, Jörg Morré, said he would be renaming it Museum Berlin-Karlshorst. “Already on the first day of the invasion we said this is such a profound turning point that we had to do this,” Morré told the broadcaster rbb24. He said it no longer seemed appropriate to be giving the Russian federation the status it had enjoyed in the title. The museum is housed in the former officers’ mess of the Wehrmacht, Germany’s wartime armed forces in the district of Karlshorst in east Berlin. It was there, on 8 May 1945, that German officers agreed to give up their fight in a meeting with Red Army generals, and representatives from the US, Britain and France. The museum was established 30 years ago by German and Russian historians, after the withdrawal of Soviet armed forces from Germany after German reunification. Funding for it has come from the governments of both countries, and it was opened to the public in 1995 as the German-Russian Museum, dedicated to the history of German-Soviet relations. In particular it focuses on the second world war, including the Red Army’s role in liberating Berlin, but reaches back to 1917. Historians from cultural organisations from Germany, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have collaborated on its exhibits. As a sign of solidarity towards Ukraine, on the day Russia invaded Morré removed all the flags of these four countries usually on display in front of his museum, leaving just the Ukrainian flag. But he said he was resisting calls for the removal of the many Soviet war memorials around Berlin, including at his museum, some of which have Red Army tanks incorporated into them. A Soviet T34 tank is on display in the grounds of his museum, along with a collection of heavy Soviet military equipment used during and after the war. He stressed that the museum was still intent on commemorating the efforts and achievements of the Red Army in their fight against Adolf Hitler and in liberating Berlin, which he stressed had involved soldiers from Russia and Ukraine, as well as other former Soviet states. The bodies of thousands of the troops are buried in military graveyards in and around Berlin. An increasing number of the memorials, including one in Treptower Park adorned with a Stalin quotation, have been vandalised and covered in graffiti in recent weeks out of protest at the invasion of Ukraine. “I am completely against dismantling them or razing them to the ground … however out of place they seem. But we do obviously have to contextualise them,” Morré said. Events to mark the anniversary are to take place this coming Sunday and Monday, but will be low-key and will emphasise the victims of war, including remembering Ukrainian victims of the current conflict, officials have said. The Russian embassy in Berlin has said it will hold its own commemorations to mark the end of the second world war, including at the three main memorial sites in Berlin as well as at the site of former concentration camps, but will keep the precise times and locations secret “for security reasons”. Berlin’s senate said about 50 demonstrations and events – including pro- and anti-Russian demonstrations – were planned across the city and that police were bracing themselves for clashes, saying the situation “poses a very sensitive threat”. Last month there was outrage after a motorcade of pro-Russia protesters was allowed to drive through the city. On Sunday a demonstration by Mothers for Peace is to take place outside the Berlin-Karlshorst museum, while an anti-war protest is due to march through the government quarter. Police have said they will restrict the number of Russian flags on display and clamp down on any attempts to glorify the invasion. Demonstrators will be forbidden from using car horns or displaying the pro-war Z symbol, which stands for za podebu (for victory).",News/World news,‘We had to do this’: Berlin museum to drop ‘Russian’ from name ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/we-had-to-do-this-berlin-museum-to-drop-russian-from-name
5/6/2022,"Luxembourg, the clear favourite for the Derby since his running-on third in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, could miss the Classic at Epsom on 4 June after suffering a setback on the gallops, Aidan O’Brien, the colt’s trainer, said on Friday. “Luxembourg was just a little bit lame on his off-hind this morning after cantering,” O’Brien said. “We’re not sure why just yet, but wanted to let people know with the Derby coming soon. In a couple of days, we’ll hopefully know a bit more and will issue a further update.” Luxembourg was a 5-2 chance for the Derby on Friday morning but drifted to 6-1 after news of his setback emerged. His stable companion Changingoftheguard, who finished six-and-a-half lengths clear of Charlie Appleby’s highly-rated New London in the Chester Vase on Wednesday, is 6-1 (from 10-1) while Walk Of Stars, a runner in the Derby Trial at Lingfield on Saturday, and Piz Badile, the winner of the Ballysax Stakes in April, are both available at 7-1. O’Brien runs United Nations, currently 50-1 for the Derby, in Lingfield’s Epsom trial on Saturday, and Stone Age (14-1 for the Classic) in the Group Three Derby Trial at Leopardstown the following afternoon. The Classic trials at Lingfield on Saturday afternoon will offer a few more pieces of the puzzle before the Derby and Oaks at Epsom next month, but a more immediate priority for many punters will be an annual attempt to find the winner of the Victoria Cup at Ascot, one of the most competitive Flat handicaps of the season. A double-figure draw has been vital in the last decade, and Vafortino, who joined Kevin Philippart de Foy from Joseph O’Brien’s stable over the winter, is interesting from 27 after a promising return in March, while 33-1 shot Royal Pleasure could outrun his price if he gets away on terms. The runner with the most positives, though, is Fresh (4.05), whose form figures in big-field Ascot handicaps last season were 1-2-3. He was first home on his side in a valuable race over track and trip in October and is off the same mark on Saturday. Ascot 1.45: Lightly-raced Screaming Petrus was steadily progressive at three and his opening mark of 76 could be generous. Lingfield 2.05: Verreaux Eagle is on her last winning mark and may not need to improve on her last run at Brighton to win here. Ascot 2.20: Al Aasy, talented and quirky in equal measure, was beaten three times last season after trading at long odds-on in running. Third Realm, at his best in early 2021, looks a safer bet. Lingfield 2.40: United Nations looks sure to improve with every step up in trip and can extend O’Brien’s strong run of form in Classic trials. Haydock 3.00: Top conditional Mark McDonagh takes 5lb off the back of Anna Bunina and that could tip the balance. Lingfield 3.15: Belt Buckle was much better than the bare result at Wolverhampton in February and could well improve past Ballydoyle’s runner, Emily Dickinson. Ascot 3.30: Delta Bay will go close if the switch to Hughie Morrison sees a return to her winning form at Newmarket last spring. Lingfield 3.50: Wren’s Breath, a Listed winner last July, is an interesting Flat runner for Henry de Bromhead. She has scope for improvement this year with just three runs in the book.",Sport/Sport,Derby cloud gathers over Luxembourg after gallops setback for O’Brien,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/derby-cloud-gathers-over-luxembourg-after-gallops-setback-for-obrien-horse-racing
5/6/2022,"Globally, one in every 42 children is born a twin. According to a study analysing birth records from more than 100 countries, this is an increase of a third over the past 40 years. But the trend is now moving downward. So have we reached “peak twin”? I spoke to the study’s author, Christiaan Monden from the University of Oxford. What does “peak twin” mean?It means we’ve reached a point where we’ve seen or are seeing the maximum number of twins being born in the world, and that the number will ultimately go down. That’s what we mean by twin peaks – sorry, peak twin. I keep saying “twin peaks”, too, but that’s a David Lynch series. Although in a way, lots of twins suddenly being born is quite strange. Trippy, perhaps Lynch-esque. But I digress! Is the global peak mostly because of Europe?We’ve always seen higher twinning rates in Africa. That’s genetic. But with the introduction of IVF in western Europe, the US and countries such as Australia and South Korea, the twin rates have risen more widely. Those trends are now reversing as IVF regulators have been changing their policies to get the twin rate down because of the increased health risks associated with twin pregnancies. How?With IVF, you have to make a decision: how many fertilised eggs do you transfer back into the mother? You want at least one of them to survive, so you have more of a chance if you transfer two or three eggs – but if they all survive, they become twins or triplets. In the early 90s, only one in eight women had a single embryo transferred, but now three-quarters do, still with the same success rate because over the years IVF has improved. So have we lived through some sort of historical blip where we have a lot of twins, and it will never happen again?Yes. Unless some other fertility treatment comes up that has a similar impact – which is extremely unlikely – this won’t happen again. Perhaps it should if all the headlines about Britain’s baby shortage are to be believed.The fertility rate has been going down very slowly, yes, but IVF numbers will still increase. So I’m not worried. We’re not in the position of some countries with ultra-low fertility. We don’t want to go there – not because there are too few of “us” on the islands, but because low rates might indicate people don’t have the conditions, both financial and social, that allow them to achieve their desired number of children. I hear you on the dog-whistle nationalistic undertones of some population discourse. But then there’s the economics. We have an ageing population.That’s a bit gloomy. Very few pro-natalist policies have worked, by the way. If you give someone cash for a baby, they don’t have more children, they just have the ones they wanted, earlier. And when pro-natalist policies promote nationalist ideas, it doesn’t help increase our quality of life. But we do need to think about how we stay productive for longer. Robots! Keeping with the Lynch theme …Yes! There are more important things to focus on than too few humans. We should focus on the quality of life, not on the quantity.

5/6/2022,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Duke of York will not be joining other royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony after the trooping the colour that kicks off the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations. The Queen has decided only working royals will gather on the balcony for the traditional flypast at the conclusion of the ceremony on Thursday 2 June. A Buckingham Palace source said: “After careful consideration, the Queen has decided this year’s traditional trooping the colour balcony appearance on Thursday 2 June will be limited to Her Majesty and those members of the royal family who are currently undertaking official public duties on behalf of the Queen”. Wider family members, including Harry and Meghan, if they are in the UK, and Andrew, will be invited to jubilee events, including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral. Aides have also not confirmed or denied that the jubilee weekend could see a second balcony appearance, after the jubilee pageant on Sunday 5 June, which could see wider family members invited. The source said family members will be invited to the jubilee events. “We have always made that clear.” Harry and Meghan were reportedly invited by the Queen to take part in a jubilee balcony appearance following the couple’s brief low-key visit to his grandmother en route to the Invictus Games in the Netherlands last month. During the diamond jubilee just six members of the royal family – the Queen, Charles, Camilla, William, Kate and Harry appeared on the balcony, interpreted as a reflection of Charles’s desire for a slimmed down monarchy. During the golden jubilee, the royal family made a balcony appearance following the jubilee pageant. The trooping balcony appearance is the only balcony appearance confirmed in advance of this jubilee. The Queen’s decision means on the balcony after trooping the colour, she will be joined by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Princess Royal, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra. In addition the Cambridge and Wessex children are also expected to appear, as is Sir Tim Laurence, husband of Princess Anne. The Queen, who has cancelled several recent high-profile engagements due to mobility issues, is said to be planning to take part in the celebrations, but it is not known which events she will attend. The source said: “Her Majesty is looking forward to the weekend and will be taking part in the celebrations but her presence will not be confirmed until much nearer to the time or even on the day itself”. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has revealed that the Gold State Coach, seen at coronations, jubilees and other high profile events since it was built in 1762, will be a highlight of the platinum jubilee pageant. It will be drawn by eight Windsor Grey horses along the pageant route on Sunday 5 June. And, though the Queen herself will not be seated in it, showing in the remodelled coach windows will be archive footage of the young Queen recorded on Coronation Day. The third-oldest surviving coach in the UK, made of giltwood and weighing four tonnes, it will be its first appearance on London’s streets for 20 years.",News/UK news,"No Harry, Meghan or Andrew on balcony at start of jubilee events",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/06/platinum-jubilee-trooping-the-colour-balcony-queen-harry-meghan-andrew
5/6/2022,"I’ve always liked animals and nature but I didn’t really consider myself an environmentalist until I went to uni and went veggie, which started as a moral concern but became environmental. It sounds like a cliche, but it was David Attenborough’s The Blue Planet that really spurred me on: I made a petition on Change.org about plastic cutlery and it got 150,000 signatures, which inspired me to do my master’s in environment, politics and society at UCL. I’m a project coordinator at an environmental charity called Hubbub. We try to inspire greener ways of living: our motto is anyone can be an environmentalist whether they know it or not. There’s a perception of environmentalists as quite finger-waggy, but Hubbub is all about making funny, easily accessible campaigns that usually have a cost-saving element to them, or a mental and physical health benefit. We all know we need to shift to electric vehicles (EVs): it’s just one of the many measures that must happen in the very near future if we want to keep [limiting global warming to] 1.5 [degrees C] alive. They won’t solve all our ills by themselves, but it’s something we have to do alongside car sharing, higher-speed rail networks, more accessible public transport: we have to adopt multiple options, and electric vehicles are a huge one. It’s not just the fact they produce zero driving emissions. Noise pollution is a big issue in city centres. It has negative effects that people don’t even think of, from stress to hearing loss, and because electric vehicles are so quiet they are hugely beneficial in that respect. I’ve always wanted an EV, but have been put off by the fact I don’t have off-road parking – I’d assumed you always had to charge them overnight – and because I didn’t really know where to start with all the electric brands. It always felt like something I’d get around to soon, but not right now. I go into the office by public transport: living in London, it’s what works for me, although I realise a lot of people need to drive to work. But my partner and I love to drive out to the countryside at weekends: we’re National Trust members and we’re lucky enough to live in a bit of west London where it’s easy to get out of the city. I love a UK road trip: you can just chuck everything in the boot and be off straight away, you don’t have to really plan ahead or faff around with airports, we can just pop our dog Moochie in the boot, you’re comfortable, you’ve got your own music, and I love to settle in to a good long podcast series. We often drive to Dorset where my partner’s from. We’ve driven up to Scotland a few times, and went to the Cotswolds for a week right after our wedding last year. It was incredible taking the BMW i4 eDrive40 M Sport out to the country. It’s so smooth and comfortable to drive, and I felt more than confident behind the wheel. The electronic dashboard made the whole process so much easier, especially the fact that it’s curved towards you, which makes it really easy to see. There’s even a mini version of the satnav projected on to the driver’s windshield, which is just incredible. And you can use the Hey BMW voice assistant to operate everything without even having to look away from the road. I love how everything’s connected up so easily: just press the screen twice and it brings up a map and list of nearby charge points. You could even find them in the middle of the country, in places such as pub car parks, far more than I was expecting – I found one at a nearby college. The i4 is also quicker to charge, with a greater battery range, than I was expecting – more than 200 miles off 80% battery – so I wouldn’t need to plug it in at home every night. The range extends up to an impressive 365 miles* when fully charged. When it comes to electric cars, there are a lot of unfamiliar brands. But BMW is a really premium German brand, and the i4 is a really cool car: easy to use, incredibly comfortable, and high performance. If we’re going to get people to shift to EVs we need more options like this on the market. I love the fact the BMW i4 is manufactured in hydroelectric-powered plants, because you not only need to think about the emissions from a car when it charges or runs, but also about the emissions while they are being manufactured. So reducing the overall impact they have on the environment is another win. The fact the i4 is entirely electric also makes me more willing to use all the features, for instance, the i4 can be preconditioned before you get in using power from the battery, ensuring it isn’t drained by heating and warming the cabin during the journey. It’s a great way to make the car comfortable from the moment you are seated. It was amazing to take it out into the country – connecting to nature has huge benefits to our health but it’s also a reminder of what we’re trying to look after, seeing beautiful landscapes, rolling hills, lambs and cows – it’s what you’re trying to protect. I find that inspiring, and doing it in an EV was even more so. This was a real glimpse into the future. Kirstie Brittain-McVey is a model and environmentalist.

5/6/2022,"Keir Starmer faces an investigation by Durham police in connection with an event at which he was photographed holding a beer in April last year, and whether this potentially breached Covid rules at the time. Here is what we know: Following days of media coverage, and pressure from some Conservative MPs for police to act, the Durham force said that following “the receipt of significant new information over recent days” it would investigate what took place at the event on 30 April 2021. Starmer was filmed through a window of the office of Mary Foy, the MP for the City of Durham, holding a bottle of beer, with people behind him eating from plates of food. The Labour leader was there as part of campaigning for the byelection in nearby Hartlepool, which was taking place six days later. The footage first emerged in January this year. In February, Durham police said there was no case to take any action over the matter. What has changed is firstly a campaign by some newspapers and MPs, and also the emergence of some new information, including that takeaway food was ordered for up to 20 or 30 people, and that Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, also attended, which the party initially said she had not. It is not known whether any of this is the “significant” new information, or if there are elements not yet reported. Police said last week they had received a number of further communications on the matter, but had no comment. It has been reported that the force had already decided to begin the investigation but delayed any announcement so as not to potentially interfere with the results of Thursday’s local elections. The Met police, who are investigating potential multiple breaches of Covid rules in and around Downing Street, similarly suspended any updates ahead of the elections. While Covid rules necessarily involve some interpretation, on the basis of what is known publicly so far, the legal and police consensus appears to be not. Political campaigning was permitted ahead of the local elections, which took place on the same day as the byelection, allowing gatherings of party activists. Starmer has said the images show campaigners breaking for takeaway food, and that with pubs and restaurants shut this was the only option if they were going to eat. The barrister and Covid rules expert Adam Wagner has said this would be similar to colleagues eating in a work canteen and would thus be viewed as “reasonably necessary for work”. Wagner contrasted it with seemingly prearranged social events at Downing Street for which Boris Johnson and others have been fined. However, this could change, depending on what new information has been passed to police. While the party is confident no rules were broken, the announcement is deeply unwelcome, allowing political opponents to cast a moral and legal equivalence between Starmer and the prime minister, who has already received a fixed-penalty notice for one illicit gathering. Starmer called on Johnson to resign after the penalty, and for Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, to do the same after he also received one. So if Starmer was fined there would be pressure for him to step down. Even if the police decide there is no case to answer, the investigation could drag on for some weeks. A party spokesperson said: “We’re obviously happy to answer any questions there are and we remain clear that no rules were broken.” The party says it was a fairly standard press office cock-up. Party sources argue the question was asked some weeks ago by the Daily Mail, and a junior staff member misunderstood diary records and said Rayner was elsewhere. It was only when the Mail asked again, and officials checked, that they realised the mistake. It is not clear whether Rayner’s presence or not would change the legal position.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer’s office beer: what we know as investigation announced,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/keir-starmer-office-beer-what-we-know-investigation-announced
5/6/2022,"Pep Guardiola has said “maybe I’m not good enough” to lead Manchester City to Champions League glory but the manager is clear the team will keep trying to triumph in the competition. City were knocked out in the semi-finals by Real Madrid on Wednesday, 6-5 on aggregate, having led 5-3 overall and 1-0 on the night with seconds remaining at the Bernabéu. Guardiola was proud of his side despite the shock of the defeat but questioned himself after a sixth disappointment in the competition in his six years in charge. “Maybe I’m not good enough to help the team to do it,” he said. “Nobody knows what would have happened with other players or managers. We were close – they know it, we know it – but what is important is we are going to try again next season, and then again.” Guardiola was asked whether his squad was capable of winning the Champions League. “I don’t know. It’s a question I cannot answer,” he said. “Before Madrid I didn’t know [too]. Sometimes you ask me questions but I don’t have the answer to all of your questions. Football is incredibly unpredictable. We saw it. “Maybe I’m wrong, but I have the feeling that the people from Abu Dhabi bought this club and invested in these incredible facilities and players like a lot of other clubs in the world to have what we have lived in the last years – not to just win the Champions League. They did it to be there in all competitions every season and compete in all competitions until the end. We want to do it.” Guardiola said he had not spoken to his players in the two days after the loss. “We didn’t speak. No words can help what all of us feel. It is just a question of time, sleep as well as possible and think of the next target. Tomorrow [Saturday] will be the first day we are together and we are going to talk about who we are as a team, what we have done in the semi-final, how good we have been not just in these two games but all season and try to do it over the last weeks. It is probably one of the moments since I am manager I am most proud to be in this club and organisation, and until the last day we are here we give everything together.” City host Newcastle on Sunday.

5/6/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing the wrath of senior Conservatives frustrated at his leadership and doubtful about his usefulness as an electoral asset in the aftermath of a difficult set of results for the party. David Simmonds, MP for Ruislip After losses in Johnson’s backyard, Simmonds said: “Clearly the prime minister has difficult questions to answer. People were broadly positive about the government’s policies but they are not happy with what they’ve been hearing about Partygate. He needs to [front] up and answer questions.” Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet The backbencher, who submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson several months ago, suggested it was time for a leadership contest. He said: “I was, as you know, not in favour of a leadership challenge in the middle of a war, but two things have happened: one, it’s now clear, I think, that the hostilities in Ukraine are going to be prolonged; and second, in a sense what Roger Gale thinks is immaterial because this movement has got a life of its own now – it may become an unstoppable tide.” Asked if he would say Johnson should go regardless of whether an interim administration could be established in light of the Ukraine crisis, Gale said: “Yes. I think so. I would.” John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle city council After Labour won 30 of the 46 seats on the newly formed Cumberland council while the Conservatives managed just seven, the leader of one of the councils it subsumed voiced his frustration at Johnson. Mallinson said: “I think it is not just Partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don’t feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth. I don’t think any one person is responsible for everything, but he does seem to be attracting a lot of unrest and ill-feeling at the moment.” Asked if he thought that feeling would carry on until the next general election, Mallinson said: “I think if things remain the same it will, I think we’ll pay for it.” He said Johnson would be a “poor option” to lead the Conservatives into the next general election. “People seemed preoccupied with national issues, the cost of living crisis is weighing very heavily on people’s minds, and I have to say that issues like Partygate made it increasingly difficult to focus people’s minds on local issues.” Ravi Govindia, leader of the Wandsworth Conservatives Having been deposed as leader of the Tories’ flagship council, Govindia made clear that Johnson’s leadership had been a factor in voters flipping the council to Labour’s control. He said: “Let’s not be coy about it, of course national issues were part of the dilemma people were facing.” Gavin Barwell, Conservative peer A former Croydon MP who went on to become Theresa May’s chief of staff, Barwell said the local election results in London were “catastrophic” and should be a wake-up call. “Wandsworth and Westminster were flagship councils. We held them during the Blair honeymoon. We held them during austerity. We held them under Theresa May. Losing them should be a wake-up call for the Conservative party.” Simon Bosher, leader of Portsmouth city council’s Conservative group After the Tories lost four council seats in Portsmouth, Bosher called for Johnson to “take a good, strong look in the mirror”. He said: “I have to say the results have been extremely disappointing. Not totally unexpected, I have to say. We have actually lost some very good working community councillors this evening. “Personally I think those in power in Westminster really do need to take a good, hard look in the mirror because it is the rank and file grassroots members they rely on that are actually losing their seats tonight and it is pretty disappointing across the board.” Asked if he was talking about the prime minister, Bosher said: “I think Boris does need to take a good, strong look in the mirror as well because I think he needs to look at those people that we have lost tonight … because those are people that are actually bearing the brunt on the doorstep of behaviour of what’s been going on in Westminster.”",News/Politics,‘Catastrophic’: what Tories are saying about their local election losses,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/catastrophic-what-tories-are-saying-about-local-election-losses-boris-johnson
5/6/2022,"Good, but not quite good enough. Keir Starmer might just swallow that as a description of Labour’s performance in Thursday’s local elections. The task he faces now is ensuring those words do not become his political epitaph. Make no mistake, there is much for Labour to celebrate in these results. The party has turned the capital city into a Labour heartland, so that London councils that were once bywords for Thatcherism – Wandsworth and Westminster – have moved from blue to red. (A notable win was Labour’s capture of Barnet, home to the largest Jewish community in the country, and evidence that Starmer’s efforts at brand decontamination on that score have not been in vain.) But this is not merely a London phenomenon, but rather an urban England one: Labour is in charge in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Norwich, too. There were gains in the south to shout about, thanks to a win in Southampton, and in the north, with an unexpected victory in Cumberland. Labour’s overall share of the vote looks healthier. And yet no one would hail this as the kind of nationwide shift that is a clear prelude to general election victory. For that to be true, there would have had to be Labour advances everywhere, including in the red wall areas that delivered Boris Johnson his 80-seat majority in 2019. But the picture was patchier than that. Of course, it can be a mistake to read too much into local elections. Worse than a mistake, it’s an insult to regard them as a glorified opinion poll for the Westminster parliament when they are democratic contests in their own right, ones that have a direct impact on people’s daily lives. But they can be revealing. And one thing these results show is the limits of Labour’s, and Starmer’s, current approach. Consider just how bad things are – or should be – for the Conservative government. A cost of living crisis is pressing in on Britons, and it is set to get much worse. Energy bills are already through the roof, and now mortgage payments are going up after this week’s hike in interest rates. Inflation is the highest it’s been for years, at 7%, and forecast to reach 10% by the autumn, with the Bank of England warning of a “sharp economic slowdown” this year. If the most important question in electoral politics is usually “Are you better off now than you were before?”, most voters would answer with a loud and angry “No.” And that’s before you get to the state of this administration. In power for 12 years, almost to the day, with a prime minister who broke a life-and-death law that he had imposed and who is thought by 78% of the country to have lied about it; a government whose state of moral decay is embodied by the MP who watched porn in the House of Commons and expected us to believe he only wanted to look at … tractors. The glum reality is that a governing party behaving like this, against this economic backdrop, should have been crushed at the polls on Thursday. It did badly, but not badly enough. Put that together with the story told from the doorstep – that while there is plenty of disillusion with Johnson and the Tories, there is no wave of enthusiasm for Starmer and Labour. The fact that much of the current discontent found its outlet in support for the Liberal Democrats and Greens rather than Labour, even in traditionally Labour areas, adds to the same picture: voters breaking from this government but not yet embracing the alternative. That points to a clear conclusion for Starmer to draw: that even when the prevailing conditions for an incumbent government are dire, mere opposition by the opposition is not sufficient. In Labour’s case, two things are holding it back. One is easy enough to remedy; the other much harder. The first is that Labour is approaching the next general election much as the Conservatives approached the contest that brought them into office in 2010. David Cameron and George Osborne devoted more energy to attacking Gordon Brown and Labour than to sketching out their own plan for the country. It worked well enough to wipe out Brown’s majority without delivering an outright Tory win. The contrast is with 1995 to 1997, when Brown and Tony Blair spent more time promising a “new Britain” than they did pointing out the failings of John Major, culminating in the landslide Labour victory whose 25th anniversary passed this week. To be sure, the circumstances were very different: Blair and Brown had the luxury of talking about Labour’s offer in the mid-1990s because by then the Tories were so obviously a busted flush. The polling was unmistakable: Labour was on course to victory. But the lesson remains, all the same. Oppositions flourish when they don’t just enrage voters about the present but encourage them about the future. (It doesn’t help that channelling public fury about Partygate just got more complicated, with reports that Durham police are to investigate Starmer over a beer he had during lockdown.) The second is more awkward, because it’s more personal. The BBC’s political editor described Labour’s performance as far from “dazzling”. Starmer does not dazzle, and that’s not going to change. He does not have that kind of charisma. But that need not be fatal. As the i paper reports, some southern Tory MPs privately fear that Starmer’s “boring, unthreatening reputation” might even be his secret weapon, not least because it frees remainerish Tory voters to shift to the Lib Dems in a way they did not dare in 2019 for fear of letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. There might even be a constituency of voters who have grown sceptical of charismatic men and the trouble they bring. Watch WeCrashed, the story of WeWork founder Adam Neumann and his “supernova” charisma, noting how it all ended in disaster, and you can’t help but think of Johnson or Donald Trump, or the Iraq war messianism of Blair. After Johnson the steady, unflashy competence of a Keir Starmer could appeal. Still, in the absence of charisma, you need something else. There is a moment in The 47th, the new play at London’s Old Vic that imagines Trump seeking re-election in 2024, in which the former president recalls his win in 2016. Even if you hated him, he says, you knew what he was going to do, whether it was a ban on Muslims or building a wall. What concrete thing, Trump asks, was Hillary Clinton going to do? Anyone? Here, then, is how Labour might raise the current ceiling on its performance, demonstrated by these latest results. Talk a bit less about what the Tories are doing; talk a bit more about what Labour will do – and do it not with a rock-star personality at the top but a few sharp, memorable promises that lodge in the consciousness. It won’t be enough to win a 1997-style landslide: one of those is not coming anytime soon. But it might be enough to repeat 2010, depriving the incumbent PM of his majority and allowing for a change of government. And right now, I think we’d take that.

5/6/2022,"Apost-match episode in mutual appreciation as stragglers made their way along Paisley Road West shortly before 11.30pm on Thursday. RB Leipzig fan: “Great stadium.” Rangers fan: “We were the underdogs.” Leipzig fan: “Underdogs? This is Glasgow Rangers.” Laughs, handshakes and both went on their merry way. Anyone with an interest in football’s soul – certainly in Germany - may find it appropriate that Rangers progressed to the Europa League final at the expense of the sporting wing of an energy drinks empire. Red Bull and its wings cannot upstage Ibrox when it sings. Those who visited as part of the Leipzig contingent did appear struck by the atmosphere, which was far more intense than a week earlier at the RB Arena. What the late-night exchange further illustrated was a sense that Rangers are still regarded as serious operators in Europe. Although various matters, mostly with a foundation in history, back up that point it remains incredible that Giovanni van Bronckhorst will lead his team into the final in Seville. That much is entirely to Rangers’ credit. They absolutely deserve to be there. Teams who failed even to reach the last four include Barcelona and Napoli. English sniffiness about the Scottish football scene should quieten for the moment given West Ham and Leicester were toiling on the very evening Rangers sent Ibrox into raptures. The scale of Rangers’ achievement is emphasised when their personnel are assessed. The right-back James Tavernier is the Europa League’s top scorer. The goalkeeper Allan McGregor is 40. Alfredo Morelos, Van Bronckhorst’s main striker, missed both legs of the semi-final. So, too, did his backup Kemar Roofe. It is hardly being disrespectful to Scott Wright, Ryan Jack, Joe Aribo, Fashion Sakala, Borna Barisic or Connor Goldson to point out they would not trouble the starting XIs of Borussia Dortmund or Leipzig yet both those German clubs have been swatted aside by Rangers en route to the showpiece occasion on 18 May. John Lundstram is the current darling of the Ibrox faithful and has vastly improved over this season but the fact remains this free transfer from a then Championship-bound Sheffield United, who has been shuffling between centre midfield and centre-back, conquered Leipzig, a team containing a striker, Christopher Nkunku, eyed by the continent’s top clubs and valued at £70m. Rangers are not Rag Tag Rovers but in black and white they have no business being in a European final. Rangers fans should not cry foul at such candid analysis. Instead, they must revel in the unity – and skill – that has brought them this far. When Celtic reached the Uefa Cup final of 2003 – also in Seville – the availability of the outstanding Henrik Larsson meant they could be accused of rampaging through the competition in cheat mode. What the Glasgow clubs have in common, even 19 years apart, is a stadium backdrop that has continually unnerved foreign opposition. The dizzying noise of Ibrox seemed to paralyse Leipzig, as it has done Braga, Red Star Belgrade and countless others in recent times. Rangers have no cause to fear Eintracht Frankfurt. That much feels curious to state, given Scottish Premiership points shipped to Ross County and Motherwell and the League Cup semi-final tousing at the hands of Hibernian. Europe highlights Rangers’ split personality. Some of that may be tactical – Rangers can counterattack in the Europa League to a far greater extent than they generally do at home – but Van Bronckhorst’s men appear to garner an extra level of resilience when the opposition are foreign. Steven Gerrard fostered and developed this during his tenure. This team, in fact, was built by Gerrard. Yet Van Bronckhorst, by becoming the fourth manager to guide Rangers into a European final, has surpassed his predecessor. Eintracht sit 11th in the Bundesliga, nine places behind Dortmund and six adrift of Leipzig. Rangers will relish this battle. Celtic fans will not like the comparison but it is a valid one; when they enjoyed vast competitive advantage in Scotland after Rangers’ financial meltdown of 2012, they could not make anything like the European headway their oldest foes have done now. In illustrating the most strange of times, an outcome where Celtic are the Scottish champions and Rangers claim a European trophy would leave both halves of the Old Firm perfectly content. Each would be able to enjoy Champions League group stage football, which has not been the case since season 2007-08. Scotland’s coefficient charge is such that two automatic entrants into the top tier of European competition as standard is within view. With the national team in a fine place under Steve Clarke, the broader picture is healthy. Rangers will probably care little about that as they anticipate 18 May and the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán stadium. Nor should they; there have been such struggles over the past decade that Glasgow’s blue half are entitled to savour their moment and their moment alone. This has been a run worthy of the most lavish praise. It would be folly to deny that its finest moment is yet to come.",Sport/Football,Rangers show power of unity and have nothing to fear in Europa League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/rangers-show-power-of-unity-and-have-nothing-to-fear-in-europa-league-final

Hiring continued despite worries about the Federal Reserve’s plans to hike interest rates at their fastest pace in decades in an attempt to curb soaring inflation. April represented the 12th consecutive month of jobs gains above 400,000. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said job growth was widespread, led by gains in leisure and hospitality, in manufacturing, and in transportation and warehousing. Wages too are continuing to rise. Average hourly earnings rose by 10 cents, or 0.3%, to $31.85 in April. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 5.5%, strong growth in comparison to recent years but still below the annual rate of inflation which reached 8.5% in March. The US has now regained over 90% of the jobs lost at the height of the pandemic but disparities remain. In April the unemployment for Black workers was 5.9% and 4.1% for Hispanics compared to 3.2% for white workers. Some 10.2% of teenagers were out of work.

5/6/2022,"Local elections are nearly always a mixed bag; giving expression to divergent points of view in different areas is part of the point of having local elections at all. But each year has its own broad trend. In 2018 Labour and the Conservatives were locked in the stalemate that had taken hold in the 2017 general election; in 2019 both main parties were hit by a wave of voter defections and in 2021 the Conservatives carried all before them. The 2022 local elections were Keir Starmer’s first significant endorsement from the electorate. Labour’s performance was at its most spectacular in London, where few had anticipated the capture of the City of Westminster on top of the more anticipated gains of Barnet and Wandsworth. The impact was magnified because every borough council seat in London was up for election and large numbers of seats changed hands. Many councils in the rest of the country elect a third of their members at a time, so there was a limit to how much could change. The Conservatives’ strong showing in 2021 will continue to influence these councils until those seats come up for re-election in 2024. Even so, there was the occasional drama such as Labour’s victory in Southampton, or the Lib Dems’ in Hull, which looked impressive even at this slowed-down rate of change. However, partial elections also allow us to compare how the parties perform from year to year. The swing to Labour since May 2021 was about 6-7% in England outside London, which puts the party a respectable but not overwhelming 3-4 points ahead of the Conservatives if translated into a national share of the vote. It is Labour’s second-biggest lead since 2001, after Ed Miliband’s peak year of 2012. The Labour advantage in 2022 is perhaps greater than it might seem from the relatively small headline lead in vote share. One reason is that, in contrast to, say, the 2016 or 2014 local elections, the right is more or less united behind the Conservatives rather than split with Ukip. The Tories no longer have that reserve army of voters. The centre-left is divided between Labour, Lib Dem and Green. While this gets in the way of building a solid popular vote lead and winning council seats in these elections, it does give Labour a pool of potentially friendly anti-Tory tactical voters from which to draw. The other positive sign for Labour is that, at first glance, the votes are appearing where Labour will find them useful. Labour’s support in the 2019 general election was very unhelpfully distributed; on a uniform swing from that result it would take a landslide popular vote of 1997 proportions in order to give Labour a bare majority in the House of Commons. The fairly low swing in the north might be enough, given many of the former “red wall” seats are still marginal; Labour’s showing in southern and eastern marginals such as Ipswich and Southampton Itchen was stronger, and the swing since 2011 was biggest of all in some parts of the Midlands. Labour was nearly wiped out in Dudley last year, winning three wards against 21 for the Tories. But in 2022 it has won 12, including two wards that were Conservative in 2018. Dudley is home to four traditionally marginal seats that returned huge Conservative majorities in the 2019 general election. If these are back in play, that parliamentary majority looks less impossible. The party will also take comfort from an (anticipated) fair showing in Scotland, where it also needs to make parliamentary gains. Labour’s poorer results tended to come in areas where the party formed the municipal establishment and gave cause for voters to turn away because of local issues. There was no sole beneficiary, as Tories, Lib Dems, Greens, local parties and independents all benefited: the Conservatives in Tameside, the Lib Dems in Hull, the Greens in South Tyneside and localist parties and independents in wards scattered across the metropolitan north. These losses look serious enough to deny Labour a truly satisfying net gain of seats. But this slippage may not put many parliamentary seats at risk, because it is happening in places where Labour is already the incumbent and it is focused on local rather than national issues. The Conservatives would therefore be most unwise if they were to take much comfort from the small-looking Labour lead. They might also ponder that in the places where the voters knew they could send a powerful message – Wandsworth, Barnet, Southampton – they did so with alacrity, delivering a hefty swing to Labour.
