4/21/2022,"A man from Michigan was found guilty of shooting a woman several times before filming himself kicking her to death. Andrew John-Lawrence Lafey, 23, stood accused of murdering Gracyn Brickley, 18, on Feb. 16, 2021, behind a Maple Grove Township home, according to Lansing NBC affiliate WILX. Lafey shot Brickley several times with a .22 rifle before using his mobile phone to record himself kicking the young woman to death, a horrifying attack that lasted nearly 11 minutes. After Lafey concealed Brickley’s body under the snow, he went back inside the Ionia County home. He showed the video to his friends, who notified authorities at the Nashville Village Police Department the following day. A call between Barry County dispatchers and deputies assigned to the crime scene was partially transcribed by Grand Rapids NBC affiliate WOOD-TV. “501 has a walk-in with a [name redacted] at this office, stating that an Andrew Lafey possibly shot a female with a .22 and buried her in the ditch sometime last night,” the call transcript read. “[Complainant] said that he was shown a video of Andrew stomping on a female’s chest.” According to WILX, Lafey’s father was one of the people who reported the crime to authorities. On Feb. 18, 2021, Andrew Lafey was charged with murder and held on a $500,000 bond, the Barry County Sheriff’s Office announced. Lafey waived his right to a trial by jury and was instead convicted by Barry County Judge Michael Schipper as part of a bench trial, according to WZZM 13. A motive for the murder was never revealed. On top of first-degree murder, Lafey was also convicted on one count of torture and four counts of firearm-related charges. Barry County Prosecutor Julie Nakfoor Pratt addressed Lafey's violence. “The circumstances of Gracyn Brickley’s death were horrific,” she said, according to WILX. “The defendant videotaped himself stomping on and taunting Gracyn for close to 11 minutes. The torture seen in the video came after Lafey shot Gracyn Brickley twice and inflicted multiple injuries to her face and breaking her jaw.” By the time Brickley was murdered, Lafey already had a criminal history dating back to 2018, according to WOOD-TV. Past charges included misdemeanor assault, burglary, and witness intimidation. The Grand Rapids outlet also reported that Lafey was sentenced to five years in prison for a 2019 home invasion but released in 2020. While awaiting trial for Brickley’s murder at the Barry County Jail, Lafey was accused of assaulting an employee, according to the Hastings Banner. “Justice for Gracyn Brickley and her family has been served,” Pratt continued after the verdict was returned. Lafey is scheduled to appear for sentencing on June 9.",U.S./Oxygen,Man Found Guilty For Shooting Woman And Recording Himself Kicking Her Until She Died,https://news.yahoo.com/man-found-guilty-shooting-woman-174902746.html
