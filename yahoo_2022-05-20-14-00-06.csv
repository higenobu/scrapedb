TikToker Jillian Orr (@jillianoreo) is a recent college graduate and LGBTQIA+ activist. Orr, who is bisexual, recently showed her pride by fabulously revealing a rainbow flag lining the inside of her gown when receiving her diploma from Brigham Young University, a conservative university owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Buried in debt? A financial expert weighs in on how to get back on track In a video Orr posted to TikTok, she explains over footage leading up to her bold statement that “at BYU, it’s against the honor code to be in a homosexual relationship.” Over a close-up shot of a rainbow flag being sewn to the inside of her graduation gown, Orr explains that if the school finds out that students are in a homosexual relationship or even just holding hands, “there are severe consequences.” Orr goes into further detail, claiming that BYU will threaten to expel students and rescind their degrees. Ultimately, “students are afraid to be who they are, so they hide out of fear until they get out,” Orr notes, over footage of her getting fitted for her graduation gown.

5/20/2022,"An otherwise healthy man with back pain and a hoarse voice was later diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. The symptoms were caused by tumors on his spine that were interfering with his vocal cords. Lung cancer can be tricky to detect early, so see a doctor if symptoms like chest pain and coughing persist. A fit, otherwise healthy 30-year old was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer after experiencing back pain and a hoarse voice, TODAY reported. Jordan Turko, an entrepreneur who lives in Edmonton, Alberta, told TODAY his symptoms started in early 2022, and he initially suspected COVID-19, since the holidays has prompted a recent surge of cases related to the omicron variant. When symptoms persisted, and the back pain spread into a deep ache in his lower back, pelvis, and legs, Turko said he visited a walk-in clinic in February. A series of tests, including a biopsy, chest X-ray, and CT scan eventually revealed a 4-inch long tumor that likely started in January and grew rapidly, doctors told Turko. The tumor had wrapped around his pulmonary artery, and others were growing along his spine and had spread to his lymph nodes, his liver, and pelvis and leg bones. Turko said he was previously in excellent health, exercised six days a week, and was a fan of hot yoga, so the diagnosis was a shock. ""Who would have guessed that? Even now, in hindsight, who would be like, 'Oh, your back is in pain. You have lung cancer,'"" he said. Lung cancer is extremely rare in younger populations, with most cases occurring in people 65 or older, and about 1.4% in people under 35, according to research. ""Cancer doesn't discriminate, including against young people. Be vigilant with your health,"" Turko told TODAY. Noticeable symptoms of lung cancer may not appear until the illness has progressed, unlike other form of cancers that are easier to spot (and treat) early, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. In some cases, symptoms of cancer may be subtle or easily mistaken for other illnesses, such as fatigue, cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, unexplained weight loss, or loss of appetite. If symptoms don't ease or become more severe, such as coughing up blood, it's important to see a doctor, according to the American Cancer Society. People at higher risk, such as smokers, or with possible recurring symptoms should consider being screened early, according to the American Cancer Society. The persistent hoarse voice that Turko experienced can be a common symptom of lung cancer, caused by the tumor impinging on nerves of the vocal cord, causing paralysis. If untreated, the tumor in his spine may have also caused more widespread paralysis, doctors worried, prompting them to recommend emergency radiation treatment.  Cancer symptoms can sometimes be overlooked in young patients, including people in their 20s and 30s, Insider previously reported.

Nature is made up of some amazing and intriguing creatures. Perhaps one of the most intriguing is the octopus. Some even believe they could be aliens. One mystery that has long evaded scientists is the octopus’s self-destruction after mating. For years, scientists have wondered why octopuses torture themselves after mating. Now, after all this time, researchers may finally have the answer. Today's Top Deals #1 best-selling bed pillows are on sale for $13 each — see why they have 126,000 5-star Amazon reviews! What?!

Get the legendary Chom Chom Roller pet hair remover for $25 Don't Miss: Today’s deals: $150 AirPods 3, rare AirTag deal, $4 smart plugs, $3 sports water bottles, more We’ve long known that mother octopuses torture themselves and sometimes even eat themselves when their eggs are close to hatching. While they aren’t the only creatures in the wild that die after mating, they do have one of the more gruesome approaches to the process. For years, scientists have tried to discover why octopuses act this way after mating. Now, a new study published in the journal Current Biology could provide the answers we’ve all been looking for. Researchers say that mother octopuses torture themselves after mating due to chemical changes that occur around the time the mother lays her eggs. A study in 1977 found that a set of glands near the octopus’s eyes was responsible for the mechanism that caused the self-destruction. The researchers found that these glands produce steroid hormones in the octopus. And, when the mother has laid her eggs, these glands go into overdrive. It is these steroids that are believed to push octopuses to torture themselves. Altogether, the researchers found three separate chemical shifts that occur at the same time the octopus mother lays her eggs. First, there’s a rise in pregnenolone and progesterone. These two hormones are usually associated with reproduction in a host of creatures. So, it isn’t surprising to see them here. Next, they saw a second shift as the octopus began producing higher levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol, or 7-DHC. This is a building block of cholesterol, and humans also produce it in the process of making cholesterol, as well. However, it may be one of the chemical changes causing octopuses to torture themselves after mating. 7-DHC can be a toxic compound. That’s why humans don’t keep it in their systems long. The researchers also noted that the optic glands began producing more of the components used in bile acids. Octopuses don’t utilize the same kind of bile acids as humans and other animals, but they do make the building blocks for those acids. The researchers believe that these chemical changes all come together and cause octopuses to torture themselves. The exact reasoning for why these changes occur, though, or why the octopus’s body is designed this way is still unclear. Z. Yan Wang, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, told Live Science that it could be a way to protect the younger octopuses. Octopuses are naturally cannibalistic creatures. As such, the torture, and subsequent death caused by these changes could be a way of naturally culling the older generation to protect the younglings before they can be killed and eaten by the older octopuses.

According to the Japan Tourism Agency, the country will allow about 50 vaccinated-and-boosted tourists to visit at the end of this month. Tourists will be part of organized tours. This will be a test to open the borders to more people. Travelers from the United States, Australia, Thailand, and Singapore will be able to enter. These countries are priority markets to Japan. Each tour group will have four people. It is unclear how the traveler selection process will go. The Japan Tourism Agency says in a statement the limited visits will test infection prevention and emergency response. Information from the tours will go to travel agencies, travel businesses, and hotels. All tourists must be with a guide and go to areas cleared by government officials. Starting in November, Japan allowed students, foreign workers, and business travelers, but cut back later that month. In March, some visitors were allowed again, but tourists were still not allowed. Other Asian countries started welcoming visitors including Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, and South Korea.

5/20/2022,"By Neil Jerome Morales and Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines president-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Wednesday said his country's ties with China will expand and ""shift to a higher gear"" when he takes power, signalling intent to advance outgoing leader Rodrigo Duterte's pro-Beijing agenda. Marcos, who won last week's election by a landslide, said he held ""very substantial"" talks by phone on Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who assured him of support for his ""independent foreign policy"", and agreed to hold more comprehensive discussions. The 64-year-old son and namesake of the notorious former dictator said Xi also acknowledged his late father's role in opening diplomatic relations between China and former U.S. colony the Philippines. ""The way forward is to expand our relationship not only diplomatic, not only trade, but also in culture, even in education, even in knowledge, even in health, to address whatever minor disagreements that we have right now,"" Marcos said in a statement. ""I told him, we must not allow what conflicts or difficulties we have now between our two countries to become historically important."" The Philippines and China have had a rocky relationship in recent years over Beijing's vast territorial claims and conduct of its coast guard and fishing fleet in the South China Sea, through which at least $3.4 trillion of annual trade passes. Many analysts expect Marcos to seek stronger ties with Beijing, but say maintaining close relations with defence ally Washington will be essential in keeping the military and the public onside in a country with historically strong links to the United States. Their phone conversation focused on bilateral ties and regional development, the Chinese embassy in Manila said in a separate statement. Xi said both countries should carry forward their friendship, grasp the general trend and follow through the blueprint for bilateral friendly cooperation, the embassy added. Marcos won the presidency with nearly 59% of the votes last week. He will take office late in June. China was among the first to congratulate Marcos, who was the first win a presidential election by an outright majority since a 1986 revolution that toppled his late father's two-decade dictatorship. Kurt Campbell, the White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, last week said the United States would seek early engagement with the Marcos administration, but said there were ""historical considerations"" that could pose challenges. Marcos said Xi had expressed a desire to talking privately. ""We are both looking forward to having further dialogue,"" Marcos said. ""He said both of us should talk, without the others.""

A NYT investigation showed the men were in custody of Russian troops before apparently being killed. A video showed the Ukrainian captives being marched in a single file and flanked by Russian troops. Videos from Bucha, Ukraine, appeared to show a group of Ukrainian captives being led at gunpoint by Russian troops moments before they were executed. The videos, obtained and verified by The New York Times, were taken on March 4 by a security camera and a civilian who witnessed the ordeal. The security camera footage showed a group of nine Ukrainians hunched over, holding the pants of the person in front of them and some with their hands placed over their heads, crossing a street in a single file. Two Russian soldiers with guns can be seen at the front and back of the group, directing the line. Eight witnesses told The Times the captives were then taken behind an office building, gunshots were heard, and the group did not reappear. Additional drone footage obtained by The Times confirmed the witness accounts, showing the groups' bodies beside an office building as Russian soldiers stood over them. The videos were not independently verified by Insider. The group of apparently executed men from the videos were also seen in a photo taken April 3. The Times said its investigation, published Thursday, uncovered the ""clearest evidence yet"" that Russian forces intentionally executed the group, ""directly implicating these forces in a likely war crime.""

According to a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry he told Marcos: ""I hope the Philippines can continue to uphold its independence and autonomy in foreign policy."" Xi spoke highly of the China-Philippine relationship over the last six years under the outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte, who tried to boost cooperation with China and put aside an international court ruling brought by Manila that rejected China's claims to almost all the waters of the South China Sea. Duterte's administration was accused of human rights violations by the Philippines' traditional allies such as the United States, while China, its biggest trading partner, promised massive investment and provided help to some of his most controversial policies such as war on drugs. ""We have effectively managed our differences through dialogue and consultation, actively promoted practical cooperation in various fields and achieved fruitful results in bilateral relations,"" Xi said. Xi promised ""continuity and stability"" towards the Philippines and pledged ""active support and help"" for the country's economic and social development, highlighting areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, energy, education, pandemic control and post-Covid recovery. Duterte's daughter Sara was Marcos's campaign partner and won the separate election for vice-president by a huge margin. Marcos, widely known as ""Bongbong"", said his new government would make Philippine-China relations a foreign policy priority and was willing to strengthen contacts at all levels and deepen cooperation in various fields such as trade and the economy, infrastructure, energy, culture and education, according to the readout. ""I am looking forward to a better and stronger future for Philippine-China relations, and I am ready to work with the Chinese side to continue ... the development of Philippine-China relations,"" he said. The Marcos family have historical connections with China. In 1974, a year before the two countries established official diplomatic relations, his father, the late Ferdinand Marcos Snr, sent his wife Imelda and 17-year-old son to visit Beijing, where they met Mao Zedong. Xi referred to the visit during the call with the dictator's son and praised him as a ""constructor, supporter and promoter"" of the bilateral friendship. Marcos responded by saying the Philippine people see China as one of their most important partners. Zhuang Guotu, a professor and former dean of Xiamen University's Research School for Southeast Asian Studies, said China was paying close attention to the Marcos government's position on bilateral ties. President Rodrigo Duterte, pictured with daughter Sara the vice-president-elect, won praise from Beijing for establishing closer relations. Photo: TNS alt=President Rodrigo Duterte, pictured with daughter Sara the vice-president-elect, won praise from Beijing for establishing closer relations. Photo: TNS> Zhuang said Washington has drastically changed its Asia-Pacific strategy - including an increased emphasis on security - and may look to Manila for support. But Beijing is not concerned that relations will worsen under the new government, he argued, citing the Marcos family's ties to Beijing and China's status as the main Philippine trade partner. ""At this moment, [Xi is] emphasising that the Philippines needs to have an independent foreign policy unaffected by other large countries,"" he said. Lucio Blanco Pitlo III, a research fellow at Asia Pacific Pathways, said Xi's remarks reflected China's hope that Marcos would emulate the current president's policy by allowing for engagement with Beijing on the economic and political fronts and dialogue on the South China Sea dispute as well as a possible joint offshore oil and gas development in the contested waters. ""Policy continuity is in China's interest. Both sides can build on the momentum in the last six years, give full play and institutionalise platforms like a vice-ministerial level bilateral consultative mechanism and a joint coastguard committee to handle sea incidents and other related maritime issues,"" he said. Beijing will also hope that both sides ""will be able to prevent their sea spat from turning into crises that can draw rivals like the US into the fray"" in the build-up to a major Chinese leadership overhaul later this year, Pitlo said. ""This may complicate its external environment at a crucial time in its domestic politics,"" he added. Ngeow Chow Bing, director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya, said Xi's reference to independent foreign policy principally meant that the Philippines should ""not be fully aligned with the US in the strategic sense"". He added that Duterte Snr's China policy ""provided much room for the Philippines to improve relations with China notwithstanding the challenges in the South China Sea,"" Ngeow said.

5/20/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Russia on Wednesday said it was using a new generation of powerful lasers in Ukraine to burn up drones, deploying some of Moscow's secret weapons to counter a flood of Western arms. Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 unveiled an intercontinental ballistic missile, underwater nuclear drones, a supersonic weapon and a laser weapon. Little is known about the specifics of the new laser. Putin mentioned one called Peresvet, named after a medieval Orthodox warrior monk Alexander Peresvet who perished in mortal combat. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told a conference in Moscow that Peresvet was already being widely deployed and it could blind satellites up to 1,500 km above Earth. He said there were already more powerful systems than Peresvet that could burn up drones and other equipment. Borisov cited a test on Tuesday which he said had burned up a drone 5 km away within five seconds. ""If Peresvet blinds, then the new generation of laser weapons lead to the physical destruction of the target - thermal destruction, they burn up,"" he told Russian state television. Asked if such weapons were being used in Ukraine, Borisov said: ""Yes. The first prototypes are already being used there."" He said the weapon was called ""Zadira"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy mockingly compared news of the lasers to the so-called wonder weapons that Nazi Germany unveiled in a bid to prevent defeat in World War Two. ""The clearer it became that they had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about an amazing weapon that would be so powerful as to ensure a turning point,"" he said in a late night video address. ""And so we see that in the third month of a full-scale war, Russia is trying to find its 'wonder weapon' ... this all clearly shows the complete failure of the mission."" Almost nothing is publicly known about Zadira but in 2017 Russian media said state nuclear corporation Rosatom helped develop it as part of a programme to create weapons-based new physical principles. The invasion of Ukraine has illustrated the limits of Russia's post-Soviet conventional armed forces, though Putin says the ""special military operation"" is going to plan. Borisov's remarks indicate Russia has made significant progress with laser weapons, a trend of considerable interest to other nuclear powers such as the United States and China. Using lasers to blind satellites was once a fantasy from the realm of science fiction, but the United States, China and Russia have been working on variants of such weapons for years. Besides the benefit of burning up drones, blinding reconnaissance systems has a strategic impact too as satellites are used to monitor intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying nuclear weapons. Borisov said he had just returned from Sarov, which is a centre of Russia's nuclear weapons research. He said a new generation of laser weapons using a wide electromagnetic band would ultimately replace conventional weapons. ""This is not some sort of exotic idea; it is the reality,"" Borisov said.

5/20/2022,"The Roeper School released a statement to Fox 2 on Tuesday saying it was reviewing the circumstances of the incident. A school for gifted students in Birmingham, Michigan, has come under fire after a teacher handed out an assignment that featured pictures of primates alongside a photo of former President Barack Obama. The educator at the Roeper School — which describes itself on its website as “the oldest preschool through grade 12 school for the gifted in the nation” — handed out the assignment earlier this month in a high school biology class, according to Fox 2 in Detroit. The worksheet asked students to look through the images of various animals and select the ones that were primates. One of those options was Obama, according to images circulating on social media. The Roeper School released a statement to Fox 2 on Tuesday saying it was aware of the assignment and was currently reviewing its circumstances. The station said it had obtained a letter that was sent to parents in which the school claimed the worksheet was taken from a university website and acknowledged that it was racially offensive and harmful.

Someone is at fault here. — Danielle Dalton (@daniodee1) May 19, 2022 Some social media users have called out officials at the Roeper School, saying the teacher must have known what was going on. “There’s not noticing a typo, and then there’s not noticing Barack Obama’s face next to a bunch of monkeys,” said one user. “The teacher knew.” The school reportedly declined to provide further information to protect the privacy of its community members, per Fox 2. It is offering counseling services to students and said it will continue to provide staff training aimed at combating racial biases on campus, according to the outlet. The Roeper School, with tuition costs of around $30,000 a year, says on its website that 31% of faculty and students are people of color. A diversity statement on the school’s online homepage reads: “Justice requires that we respect the dignity and worth of every individual by providing equality of opportunity for those to whom opportunities have been historically denied.

5/20/2022,"Former President Donald Trump worked his Pennsylvania primary endorsements to make him look like a winner, but exasperated Republicans in the state say the end result could boomerang in ways that damage both the party and Trump's own chances should he run for president in 2024. “This is the most cockamamie election I’ve ever seen in my life,” Dave Ball, the GOP chairman in Washington County, said in an interview. In the Senate race, Trump endorsed celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz, whose past liberal views made him anathema to many conservatives. Now he’s locked in a too-close-to-call race having received less than a third of the vote, according to NBC News. Three days before Election Day, Trump veered hard to the right in the governor's race by backing Doug Mastriano, the state senator who built a devoted grassroots following for his efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s win and promote Trump’s stolen election lie.  Mainstream Republicans fear that Mastriano, who had been on track to win the primary anyway before Trump's nod, is too extreme to win a general election in a state with a half million more registered Democrats than Republicans. A Democratic victory in the Pennsylvania contest for governor would reverberate through the 2024 presidential election cycle. The governor gets to appoint the secretary of state, who presides over elections in a swing state that was a focus of Trump’s bid to reverse his 2020 election loss. Former Pres. Trump’s influence on the GOP is being tested as the Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary remains too close to call. Plus, Pres. Biden invokes the Defense Production Act to boost baby formula manufacturing to ease shortage. “I would think that he [Trump] would be very interested in Doug Mastriano moderating his message and trying to run as someone who can appeal to all Pennsylvanians,” said David Urban, a former Trump campaign adviser who helped him win Pennsylvania in 2016 (Trump lost the state in 2020). “It’s not lost on anybody that the governor of Pennsylvania plays an outsize role in the 2024 election. And Republicans should be concerned about that. They should be concerned about [Democratic nominee] Josh Shapiro as governor because he’s going to be the referee.” Republican unease is growing ahead of the next big contest on the calendar: Georgia. In no other state has Trump’s heavy hand so divided the party. Georgia Republicans are set to defy Trump in Tuesday’s primary by rallying behind one of his top targets, Gov. Brian Kemp, along with the state’s incumbent insurance commissioner and attorney general. Trump has recruited or endorsed candidates challenging them all. Yet even his own political operation has grown impatient with David Perdue, the former senator whom Trump recruited to take on Kemp. Trump advisers have told Perdue’s campaign they’d like to see him devote more energy to the race, said a person close to Trump who was not authorized to speak on the record. Trump remains the most popular figure in the GOP and his endorsement is campaign gold for Republican candidates. But his endorsements nationwide have triggered a backlash from local Republican leaders in Ohio, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Georgia, where they feel as if Trump’s picks were haphazard, reckless or harmful to the party’s broader electoral objectives and even Trump’s long-term interests. Republican voters in Idaho and Nebraska also bucked Trump’s picks in their respective gubernatorial contests Tuesday and on May 10. “He endorsed candidates with no appeal to conservatives or candidates who aren’t qualified. It erodes his credibility to a degree,” said former Georgia state Rep. Scot Turner, a Republican. Turner noted Trump’s pick for Georgia attorney general, John Gordon, wasn’t a practicing lawyer for years and reactivated his law license in 2021 to take part in a failed lawsuit baselessly alleging election fraud. Turner also questioned the conservative bonafides of Trump’s pick in a Georgia congressional race, Vernon Jones, a former Democrat. A spokesman for Jones, C.J. Pearson, echoed Trump insiders by pointing out the power of his endorsement. “While the [former] president’s endorsement might not be of any importance to establishment lapdogs and political has-beens, it is important to the people of Georgia’s 10th Congressional District,” Pearson said. In Pennsylvania, Trump inflamed the situation even more after Election Day by calling on Oz to simply “declare victory” over fellow Republican David McCormick before all the ballots were counted. “It just makes it harder for them to cheat with the ballots that they ‘just happened to find,’” Trump said on his new social media site, Truth Social, without evidence of any fraud. Meanwhile, a source close to the McCormick campaign told NBC News Thursday that Trump is ""hedging his bet because he knows Oz is going to lose,"" when asked about Trump's push for Oz to declare victory while making baseless claims of cheating. Former state GOP chairman Rob Gleason said that “it’s just shocking” for Trump to essentially call for canceling Republican ballots cast in a Republican primary. “Bitterness has been developing over a period of time. It’s not just this election,” he said. “But this just didn’t help.” Last year, Trump initially anointed Sean Parnell as his chosen candidate in the Senate race. But Parnell hadn’t been fully vetted and he soon exited the race after losing a child custody battle with his estranged wife, who accused him of domestic violence, a charge Parnell denies. The field of candidates soon swelled, with McCormick and Oz entering the race, each vying for Trump’s endorsement. Trump stunned some locals by picking Oz, whose conservative bona fides were in doubt because of his past positions on guns, abortions, transgender rights and Covid lockdowns. “I think Trump stepped out in endorsing Oz … because he loves celebrity,” David La Torre, a former adviser to gubernatorial candidate Jake Corman, said in an interview. “He loves everything about celebrity, when it was obvious there were better choices for him to make.” The MAGA faithful were in open revolt at a Trump rally in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where the crowd booed Oz. Trump responded by trashing McCormick as well as insurgent MAGA candidate Kathy Barnette, who trails both Oz and McCormick in the vote tally. Then, in the governor’s race, not only did nine candidates vie for the Republican nomination, but none dropped out until the last weekend. This prevented any consolidation of the field against Mastriano, a far-right state legislator who wants to “reset” the state’s voter rolls, virtually eliminate abortion rights and has campaigned with QAnon adherants. Enthusiastic supporters see him as God’s choice, while many Republicans view him as unelectable in a state where moderates traditionally perform well. “The frustration comes from there being so many candidates and the high level of voter confusion,” said Jackie Kulback, Republican chairwoman in Cambria County. For months, Trump did not weigh in on the governor’s race, except to put out a statement telling voters not to cast ballots for former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain, who he argued hadn’t done enough to uncover evidence of voter fraud. As Mastriano surged, Trump on Saturday backed the state senator, who ultimately wound up winning by nearly 25 points, with 45 percent of the vote. “He waited so long and then when the final polls came out showing that Mastriano had a pretty significant lead, that’s when he chose to step in,” said Richard Stewart, co-chair of the state’s GOP Central Caucus, which represents 24 counties. “He just wanted a winner.” Trump also endorsed six congressional candidates in Pennsylvania, who had no or token opposition, thereby enabling him to claim that he’s 7-0 in the state, a record that would become 8-0 if Oz can hold on to his razor-thin lead. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Tom Marino, a Republican who backed Lou Barletta in the governor’s race and, like him, was one of the first members of Congress to back Trump’s candidacy in his initial run, told NBC News that it was “surprising how many people have come up to me and told me they’ve had it with Trump” because of the Mastriano endorsement. “I was surprised that when I brought home what Trump did to Lou — that he was disloyal — people cheered that and people were pissed off,” he added. What’s more, Trump’s endorsement of Mastriano may have ultimately hurt his endorsed Senate candidate, according to Marino and Barletta campaign insiders, who said that Barletta backers started flocking to McCormick out of anger. Barletta told people to vote for McCormick in the Senate race and did so himself, one campaign aide said. As of Thursday afternoon, as mail ballots were slowly counted, Oz led McCormick by about 1,200 votes, less than a tenth of a percent. “Trump’s endorsement of Mastriano backfired on Oz. There was retaliation. I was surprised by how many people said I’m not voting for anyone Trump endorsed,” Marino said. “They’ve had it with him. They were surprised with just how disloyal he was to Lou.”",Politics/NBC News,Trump leaves Pennsylvania GOP fuming over 'cockamamie election.'

5/20/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. has gathered intelligence that shows some Russian officials have become concerned that Russian forces in the ravaged port city of Mariupol are carrying out grievous abuses, a U.S official familiar with the findings said Wednesday. The Russian officials are concerned that the abuses will backfire and further inspire Mariupol residents to resist the Russian occupation. The U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Russians, who were not identified, also feared that the abuses will undercut Russia's claim that they’ve liberated the Russian-speaking city. The abuses include beating and electrocuting city officials and robbing homes, according to the intelligence finding. The new intelligence has been declassified and was shared by a U.S. official as some of the last Ukrainian fighters in the devastated city emerged from the ruined Azovstal steelworks. The fighters were ordered by their military to abandon the last stronghold of resistance in the now-flattened port city and face an uncertain fate. Hundreds of the fighters had held out for months under relentless bombardment in the last bastion of resistance in the devastated city. The city has been reduced to rubble and has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. The seaside city captured worldwide attention after a March 9 Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital, and then after another airstrike a week later on a theater that was serving as the city’s largest bomb shelter. At the theater, the word “CHILDREN” was written in Russian on the pavement outside to deter an attack. Nearly 600 people were killed, inside and outside the theater, by some estimates. It was unclear the extent of the suspected abuse gleaned in the U.S. intelligence finding, but it comes on the heels of widespread human rights abuses in and around Bucha and the suburbs of Kyiv. Evidence of the massacre in Bucha emerged early last month after Russian forces withdrew from the city.( Photographs and video from Bucha showed body bags piled in trenches, lifeless limbs protruding from hastily dug graves, and corpses scattered in streets where they fell. Meanwhile, the first captured Russian soldier to be put on trial by Ukraine on war-crimes charges pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing a civilian and could face life in prison. Russian Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old member of a tank unit, pleaded guilty to shooting an unarmed 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through a car window in the opening days of the war. Ukraine’s top prosecutor has said some 40 more war-crimes cases are being readied.",World/Associated Press,US intel shows Russians fear Mariupol abuse will backfire,https://news.yahoo.com/us-intel-shows-russians-fear-003934545.html
5/20/2022,"A Japanese man reportedly gambled away millions of Japanese yen’s worth of COVID relief funds that he received by mistake. Last month, the Japanese government inadvertently sent a COVID relief fund meant for 463 people worth 46.3 million yen ($360,890) to a 24-year-old man. After receiving the amount, the man initially said he would cooperate with local authorities but eventually went into hiding. His sudden disappearance prompted the southern town of Abu in Japan's Yamaguchi Prefecture to file a civil lawsuit while also considering criminal action.

5/20/2022,"A flight attendant for SpaceX said Elon Musk asked her to ""do more"" during a massage, documents show. The billionaire founder exposed his penis to her and offered to buy her a horse, according to claims in a declaration. After she reported the incident to SpaceX, Musk's company paid her $250,000 as part of a severance agreement. SpaceX, the aerospace firm founded by Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man, paid a flight attendant $250,000 to settle a sexual misconduct claim against Musk in 2018, Insider has learned. The attendant worked as a member of the cabin crew on a contract basis for SpaceX's corporate jet fleet. She accused Musk of exposing his erect penis to her, rubbing her leg without consent, and offering to buy her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage, according to interviews and documents obtained by Insider. The incident, which took place in 2016, is alleged in a declaration signed by a friend of the attendant and prepared in support of her claim. The details in this story are drawn from the declaration as well as other documents, including email correspondence and other records shared with Insider by the friend. In an exclusive interview, Elon Musk talks about his Twitter fame, loneliness, and what he sees as the future of artificial intelligence. According to the declaration, the attendant confided to the friend that after taking the flight attendant job, she was encouraged to get licensed as a masseuse so that she could give Musk massages. It was during one such massage in a private cabin on Musk's Gulfstream G650ER, she told the friend, that Musk propositioned her. After Insider contacted Musk for comment, he emailed to ask for more time to respond and said there is ""a lot more to this story."" ""If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light,"" he wrote, calling the story a ""politically motivated hit piece."" Insider extended the deadline and reiterated the offer to Musk to comment on the claims. He did not respond. Reached via cell phone, SpaceX vice president of legal Christopher Cardaci said, ""I'm not going to comment on any settlement agreements."" SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment to its general media contact email address. The flight attendant told her friend that the billionaire SpaceX and Tesla founder asked her to come to his room during a flight in late 2016 ""for a full body massage,"" the declaration says. When she arrived, the attendant found that Musk ""was completely naked except for a sheet covering the lower half of his body."" During the massage, the declaration says, Musk ""exposed his genitals"" and then ""touched her and offered to buy her a horse if she would 'do more,' referring to the performance of sex acts."" The attendant, who rides horses, declined and continued with the massage without engaging in any sexual conduct. The attendant ""is not for sale,"" the friend's declaration said. ""She is not going to perform sexual favors for money or gifts."" The incident occurred during a flight to London. In an interview with Insider, the friend described the attendant's allegations in more detail. She spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fears for her personal safety, but Insider is aware of her identity. Insider is also aware of the flight attendant's identity, but is not naming her because she has claimed to be a victim of sexual misconduct. She declined to comment for this story. ""He whipped out his penis, it was erect,"" the friend said, describing the allegations. ""And he started propositioning her, like he touched her thigh and told her he would buy her a horse. And he basically tried to bribe her to perform some sort of sexual favor."" The friend said that the attendant told her about the misconduct while they were on a hike together shortly after the London trip. The friend described the attendant as distraught and visibly shaken. ""She was really upset,"" the friend said. ""She didn't know what to do."" The flight attendant told her friend that work began to dry up after she refused Musk's advances. ""Before the incident, she regarded Mr. Musk as a person to look up to,"" the declaration says. ""But after he exposed himself, touched her without permission, and offered to pay her for sex, she was full of anxiety."" ""She figured things could just go back to normal and she would pretend like nothing happened,"" the friend told Insider. ""However, she started to feel as if she was receiving some sort of retaliation where her shifts were cut back, and she was starting to feel really stressed."" Eventually, the declaration says, the attendant felt ""she was being pushed out and punished for refusing to prostitute herself."" SpaceX places a special emphasis on massages, going so far as to employ in-house massage therapists as a perk for executives. According to the friend, the flight attendant was encouraged by her superiors to purchase her own professional massage training for her sessions with Musk. ""They encouraged her to get licensed as a masseuse, but on her own time, on her own dime,"" the friend said. ""They implied that she would get to fly more often if she were to do this because she'd be able to give Elon proper massages. I thought that was kind of strange because — you weren't hired to be a masseuse. You were hired to be a flight attendant. And if Elon likes massages, then he should be paying for you to go to masseuse school. But she was just so happy and eager to have the job and be able to travel."" In 2018, after becoming convinced that her refusal to accept Musk's proposal had diminished her opportunities at SpaceX, the attendant hired a California employment lawyer and sent a complaint to the company's human resources department detailing the episode. Around that time, the attorney's firm contacted the friend and asked her to prepare the declaration corroborating the claims. The attendant's complaint was resolved quickly after a session with a mediator that Musk personally attended. The matter never reached a court of law or an arbitration proceeding. In November 2018, Musk, SpaceX and the flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims. The agreement also included restrictive non-disclosure and non-disparagement clauses that bar the attendant from ever discussing the severance payment or disclosing any information of any kind about Musk and his businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla. Musk is currently engaged in a bid to purchase Twitter driven by his professed belief that ""free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy."" Earlier this month, he wrote on Twitter that ""sunlight is the best disinfectant."" Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. The friend told Insider that she decided to come forward without consulting the flight attendant because, as a survivor of sexual assault, she felt an obligation to share what she has been told about Musk. Unlike the flight attendant, her friend is not bound by any non-disclosure agreement. ""I absolutely felt a responsibility to come forward with it, especially now,"" she said. ""He is the richest man in the world. Someone with that level of power causing that kind of harm and then throwing some money at the situation, that's not accountability. There are predators all over the world. But when someone is particularly wealthy and powerful, they literally have systems that are like a machine working for them, to set them up to be able to do whatever they want."" Remaining silent, the friend said, would make her complicit. ""When you choose to remain silent, yeah, you do become a part of that system,"" she said. ""You do become a part of that machine that allows someone like Elon Musk to continue to do the horrible things that he's done."" Non-disclosure agreements are crucial components of that machine. The friend said that before she reached out to Insider, she called the attorney who represented the victim. The attorney told her that, although she was free to speak to the press, sharing any documents from the case — including her own declaration — could put the flight attendant at risk. ""Her primary concern was clearly her client,"" the friend said. She recalled the attorney saying that confidentiality provisions are ""bullshit"" and that if any other women have been victimized by Musk, they ought to come forward. But when it came to her client, the attorney urged the friend not to share the declaration. ""That would be a massive problem,"" she told the friend. California, where SpaceX is headquartered, no longer permits companies to require non-disclosure clauses in agreements like the one the attendant signed. Just months after her settlement in 2018, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the ""Stand Against Non-Disclosure Act,"" which bars the use of NDAs going forward in settlements involving sexual harassment, discrimination, or assault unless they are requested by the plaintiff. The attorney did not respond to requests for comment. ""If there were a way for [her] to come forward without putting herself at risk, without jeopardizing her life in any way, I believe she would,"" the friend of the attendant told Insider. ""I hope she feels like I did the right thing. I hope she feels I said the things that she didn't feel safe enough to say."" This is the only known allegation and settlement for sexual misconduct tied personally to Musk. Two of his companies, however, have faced allegations of sexual harassment in the past. In December 2021, the same week he was named Time's Person of the Year, four women who worked at SpaceX spoke out about sexual harassment they said they faced at the company, where Musk is the CEO. One, Ashley Kosak, published an essay recounting being groped and touched inappropriately by male employees while she was an intern. Three others — one of whom said she was bound by a non-disclosure agreement — recounted similar treatment to the New York Times. In response to the reports, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell sent a company-wide email saying that ""timely reporting of harassment is key to our maintaining SpaceX as a great place to work; we can't fix what we don't know,"" the Times reported. She added that SpaceX will ""rigorously investigate all harassment or discrimination claims and take rapid and appropriate action when we find our policy is violated."" And at least six women have sued Tesla, where Musk is the CEO, alleging sexual harassment at a Tesla factory. Men at the factory ogled women and remarked on their clothes, the complaints said, leading some women to wear baggy outfits and use stacks of boxes to obstruct the views of leering co-workers. Some of the women claimed they were retaliated against when they came forward. The friend told Insider that if anyone else was mistreated by Musk, she hopes they will publicly tell their story. If there are other victims, she said, ""I would like for them to come forward. I would like for the truth to be revealed.""

5/20/2022,"OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A tree trimmer in rural Northern California was found guilty in a series of throat-slashing attacks that left three people dead, prosecutors announced Wednesday. A jury in Butte County on Tuesday found Ryan Scott Blinston, 37, guilty of murder, attempted murder and arson, the Tehama County District Attorney's office said. Blinston, of Oroville, faces a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Blinston was working for a tree-trimming service when in 2020 he returned to the clients’ homes in Butte and Tehama Counties, north of Sacramento, after the work was completed and slashed the throats of the residents, prosecutors said. In May 2020, he attacked Loreen Severs, 88, of Los Molinos in Tehama County and her husband, Homer Severs, 91. Homer Severs survived the attack but died that December of an unrelated illness, authorities said. Blinston was also charged in the killing of Sandra George, 82, and an acquaintance, Vicky Cline, 57, both of Oroville in Butte County. He was also charged with torching Cline’s car. The District Attorney for Tehama and Butte counties agreed to combine the charges and have the case tried in Butte County, prosecutors said. Blinston was arrested before dawn on June 14, 2020 — about a week after Cline vanished — by a Butte County sheriff’s SWAT team that had tracked him to a motorhome in heavily wooded and isolated Brush Creek, where authorities planned to arrest him on suspicion of burning Cline’s car, prosecutors said. The team approached the motorhome and heard the muffled screams of a man inside and loud banging on the outside of the motorhome. The banging turned out to be Blinston attempting to get into the motorhome with a hatchet, prosecutors said. Blinston ran into the woods, refused to drop the hatchet and was captured after a short struggle and the use of a stun gun and pepper spray, authorities said. Blinston had met the 50-year-old owner of the motorhome earlier and then stayed over because he told the man he was afraid to leave after dark because of bears, the resident told authorities. The man said he was sleeping when he awoke to find Blinston attacking him with a knife, prosecutors said. Blinston slashed his neck but the man said he was able to kick him out of the motorhome and lock the door. A medic treated the seriously injured man and he was airlifted to a hospital, they said. The SWAT team may have saved the man’s life, prosecutors said, because the isolated area had no cellphone service and it was unlikely anyone would have heard the man’s cries for help. Prosecutors didn't mention a motive for the crimes other than to say robbery was not a motivating factor.",U.S./Associated Press,California tree trimmer guilty in deadly throat-slashings,https://news.yahoo.com/california-tree-trimmer-guilty-deadly-233436761.html
5/20/2022,"An angler recently reeled in a rare and “freaking scary” fish after casting his hook into a murky Texas marsh, photos show. The scaly creature’s striking look, jet black from tail to toothy tip, took the fisherman and his guide by surprise, according to a post by Lotus Guide Service. “Well … (we) found out melanistic gar do exist,” said the May 16 post, sharing photos of the fish whipping and thrashing against the fishing line. Long-established residents of Texas waterways, the prehistoric and prized alligator gar is typically brown or olive in color. But seemingly every inch of the one recently hooked in the “southeast Texas marsh” is dark black, save for the impressive teeth and pale gullet revealed by its open jaws. Though harmless to humans, alligator gar are fierce enough in appearance and in name to inspire fearful myths about them — and this strange variation is particularly stirring to some, even those familiar with the fish. “Freaking scary,” one commenter said. “Caught alligator gar growing up in Louisiana … put up a hell of a fight.” “I like this, looks hella mean,” another said. “Them thangs look deadly,” another read. Melanism, a genetic anomaly that causes darker fur, hair, skin or scales, is known to occur across the animal kingdom, though it is exceptionally rare, McClatchy News reported. How rare is melanism? Rare enough that experts generally lack enough data to offer exact figures. But there are reports of other gars with the condition having been caught or killed in the U.S. While the black alligator gar has some locals vowing to keep their toes out of the water for the foreseeable future, others were simply impressed. “Man that’s gorgeous,” a commenter said. Some were so impressed that, had they been the one to catch the gar, they said they’d have it mounted in their man cave or trophy room for all to see. The gar is safe from that fate, at least for now. The angler let the fish go after catching it, Lotus Guide Service said, with the photos as the only trophies taken. ‘Like walking a T-Rex.’ Angler uses rod, lasso to reel in huge alligator gar in Texas Angler reels in bass with parasitic surprise, Missouri photos show. ‘Lord have mercy’ 9-foot alligator found hundreds of miles from natural habitat is put down in Oklahoma Copperhead lurking in toolbox bites man fumbling around for wrench, Texas photos show",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"Angler reels in ‘freaking scary’ fish in Texas marsh, photos show.

5/20/2022,"A South Carolina man, who has been in prison for seven years for a deadly Rock Hill fire that killed his baby brother, was denied parole Wednesday. However, even with that denial, it appears under state law that Jacob Matthew Morgan could be released from prison as early as December. At that point he would have served about half of a 15-year sentence. Morgan, now 24, was denied a chance at release Wednesday by the unanimous vote of a panel of the S.C. Parole Board after a video conference hearing, said Valerie Suber, associate deputy director of the S.C. Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. The parole board had gathered in Columbia. Morgan appeared in the parole hearing from MacDougall Correctional Institute in Berkeley County. It was his second parole hearing after he was denied in May 2021. Joshua Hill, Morgan’s younger brother, was 14 months old when he died in the March 2015 mobile home fire in York County, just outside Rock Hill. Morgan was babysitting at the time. The incident captured national attention. Morgan pleaded guilty in 2016 under what is called an Alford plea, a negotiated agreement with prosecutors where Morgan did not have to admit guilt but accepted there was evidence against him that would likely convict him. The agreement came after he had been indicted on charges of first-degree arson and murder and faced up to life in prison. Morgan was convicted in 2016 on charges of third-degree arson, involuntary manslaughter and child neglect. Morgan did not admit guilt Wednesday. Parole Board chairman Henry Eldridge, of Tega Cay in York County, said Morgan was convicted of a serious charge and asked Morgan how he felt about it. “Not a day goes by that I don’t regret my brother’s death,” Morgan replied to Eldridge via teleconference. “I would gladly change places with him.” Eldridge then asked Morgan why he became involved in the deadly incident. Morgan replied that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but did not elaborate. Morgan acknowledged in the hearing after a statement from Eldridge that he has received mental health treatment while in prison. Eldridge asked Morgan if he would work if released from prison to live with his mother. “I can work if it’s necessary,” Morgan said. “I have to be responsible for my own life.” The hearing ended with no more questions. Eldridge told Morgan the parole board would vote and Morgan would be advised of the vote results. The vote was released shortly afterward. Parole board hearings are public meetings. The Herald, a part of McClatchy company, obtained permission from South Carolina parole officials to watch Wednesday’s hearing. There were no other speakers at the hearing. In 2021 Morgan’s mother spoke as an advocate for him to be released. The 2016 guilty plea and sentence, later discussions about Morgan and the case, were covered by local media and other outlets such as CNN Headline News, the Daily Mail from the United Kingdom, and regional media in both Carolinas. Police and prosecutors said in court in 2016 that Morgan set fire in at least two places in the mobile home, and did not call for help despite having a cellphone. Prosecutors said in 2016 that Morgan had set a fire two weeks before the fatal incident. Police and prosecutors said in court that Morgan lied to cover up the crime and knew that his brother would die in the fire. Sixteenth Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett said Wednesday, after Morgan was denied parole, that Morgan should serve his full sentence. There was no question the fatal fire was set intentionally and a child died, Brackett said. “It is appropriate that Mr Morgan serve his full sentence in this case,” Brackett said. Morgan’s lawyer from arrest through the 2016 guilty plea, 16th Circuit Public Defender B.J. Barrowclough, said Morgan deserves parole. “It is extremely disappointing that Jacob Morgan was denied parole again today,” Barrowclough said in a statement to The Herald. “When he went to prison he was a gentle and soft-hearted young man who had endured a difficult childhood. A quick review of his incarceration on the SCDC website shows he’s had no disciplinaries. His crime, even from the State’s perspective, was one of recklessness, not evil intent. And I know the victim’s family, which is his family, want him home because they never wanted him incarcerated in the first place. To deny this young man parole is an indictment of the parole system.” Morgan was sentenced to 15 years in prison for all three convictions, court records. The S.C. Department of Corrections Web site shows that Morgan is eligible for release from prison in December. His release date is Dec. 23. Chrysti Shain, spokesperson for the corrections department, said South Carolina law allows inmates to reduce their sentences by earning work and educational credits. In the 2021 parole hearing, Morgan said he earned a General Equivalency Diploma to graduate high school while in prison.",U.S./Rock Hill Herald,Rock Hill SC man again denied parole after conviction in fire that killed baby brother,https://news.yahoo.com/rock-hill-sc-man-again-202439343.html
5/20/2022,"(Refiling to change meeting venue to New York from Washington, paragraph 23) By Jonathan Spicer, Humeyra Pamuk and Robin Emmott ISTANBUL/WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -When Finland and Sweden signalled they were thinking of making the historic decision joining NATO, the alliance expected a tough response from Moscow, not from one of its own. Yet at a gathering of NATO foreign ministers with their Finnish and Swedish counterparts on Saturday to celebrate the biggest shift in European security in decades, Turkey's participant darkened the mood. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was ""in crisis mode"", a NATO diplomat told Reuters of the evening meeting in Berlin. A day earlier Turkey's president, Tayyip Erdogan, had shocked fellow NATO members by saying he could not support membership for either Finland or Sweden. Cavusoglu not only set conditions for Turkey accepting the membership bids but raised his voice at Sweden's Ann Linde in what three NATO diplomats said was an ""embarrassing"" break in protocol. ""For us it was a historic moment and yet Cavusoglu said he was irritated at Linde's 'feminist policy', bringing so much drama,"" another NATO diplomat said, describing a very tense atmosphere in the German foreign ministry in Berlin, in which many allies opted for silence to calm the situation. ""We were trying to understand what our Turkish colleague wanted - you know, really wanted,"" said the diplomat, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. ""It was embarrassing."" Ankara's main demands are for the Nordic countries to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present on their territory, and to lift their bans on some sales of arms to Turkey. A Turkish diplomatic source said Cavusoglu had outlined Turkey's stance respectfully, rejecting what he said was an allegation from Linde that its opposition was due to Sweden's feminist foreign policy. ""Her comments are not helping Sweden's NATO bid, while the statements coming from Finland are carefully crafted,"" the source said. Sweden's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours. Spurred on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both countries applied to join NATO on Wednesday. Russia, which says the threat posed by NATO expansion was a major reason it sent troops into Ukraine, has played it cool. While Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Finland and Sweden joining was a ""grave mistake"" with ""far-reaching consequences"", President Vladimir Putin said on May 16 their bids to join NATO posed no direct threat to Russia. CONTACT MADE The souring mood at Saturday's meeting was all the more surprising because NATO diplomats had told Reuters in early May that all 30 allies supported Finland and Sweden's accession to the alliance because of the security benefits it would bring. NATO allies had wanted to seal their accession in record time as a way of solidifying their response to Russia, yet on Monday, Erdogan said the Swedish and Finnish delegations should not come to Ankara as planned. On Wednesday, the Turkish presidency said a key Erdogan adviser had spoken with counterparts from Sweden, Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom and United States. NATO membership progess was only possible if Turkey's expectations were met, it said. One person close to the situation gave a more upbeat assessment, saying the conversation with Sweden was positive and opened the door for the delegation visits next week. Yet the calls on Wednesday came after five days of struggles by the Nordic countries to reach Erdogan's office, the person said. ""All this is muddying the waters, but not holding up the overall accession plan,"" the person said, under condition of anonymity. Ankara says the arms ban - adopted by the Nordic countries in response to Turkey's 2019 military incursion into northern Syria against Kurdish militants - is inappropriate for prospective members of a security pact. Turkish state broadcaster TRT said Sweden and Finland had not approved Turkey's request for the repatriation of 33 people with alleged links to groups it sees as terrorists. The chairman of the Swedish parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, Kenneth Forslund, said a solution could be found, but elsewhere. ""That Sweden would start expelling people who are not considered terrorists according to the terror lists the EU has, that’s totally unthinkable,"" he said. UNFINISHED BUSINESS Diplomats in European capitals say they have seen brinkmanship from Erdogan before leading to a deal. An unpredictable but strategically crucial NATO ally, Turkey under Erdogan has pursued an independent foreign policy but remains a big contributor to NATO missions. The tension has clouded ties between Washington and Ankara just as they appeared to have improved following five years of disagreements on Syria, Turkey's closer ties with Moscow, and the erosion of rights and freedoms in the country. Cavusoglu met U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in New York later on Wednesday. ""We are seeing the winds of the Cold War again,"" Cavusoglu told members of the Turkish American community late on Tuesday. The source close to the process said Cavusoglu is taking a hard line publicly, pushed by Erdogan, but that there is a risk foreign allies will isolate Turkey if he goes too far. At home, Erdogan faces tight elections by mid-2023 and his jabs at Europe play to domestic nationalist sentiment. The United States is still confident of a solution. Blinken told a news conference on Sunday talks were ongoing over the differences between Turkey, Finland and Sweden. ""When it comes to the membership process, I am very confident that we will reach consensus,"" he said.

5/20/2022,"Russian soldiers are apparently so sick of Vladimir Putin’s “stupid” war in Ukraine that they are now openly plotting with their own commanders to go AWOL. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate released a recording on Thursday that is said to show precisely that happening, with a soldier heard in a purportedly intercepted phone call detailing the plan. The soldier, identified by Ukrainian intelligence as one of many men “mobilized” by authorities in occupied Donetsk, complains that he and others in his battalion are so under-equipped that even the Chechen forces fighting alongside them mock them as “meat.” “Everyone who is here … I’m telling you … everyone is planning to take off on the 26th,” the purported soldier says. “Isn’t that stupid?” says the other man, apparently a relative back home. “Isn’t it stupid that we’re here?” the unnamed soldier shoots back. He goes on to explain that the troops have decided to abscond “on the basis of the fact that they put us on the front with absolutely nothing.” Russia Uses Ukraine’s Azovstal POWs in Demented New Propaganda Plot “I want to tell you even more,” he says, adding that a “battalion commander is leaving with us and even a staff colonel.” “They don’t provide us with any [equipment],” he says, adding that the rifles given to snipers are “from 1945.” Other units “look at them and go, ‘Holy shit, what would you need those for?’ They laugh at us. You know what they call us? Blessed. We ask, ‘Why blessed?’ They say because we are walking around with no equipment, no helmets, without anything. … The Chechens call us meat.” “It’s not desertion, because we shouldn’t be on this territory… We crossed the border as 200s,” he says, using a Russian military term for those killed in battle. “We’re not actually here. So if they say I’m a deserter, fuck off, I’m not here. Prove otherwise.” Other Russian soldiers are said to have taken equally drastic measures to get themselves out of the war. Ukrainian intelligence has released several recordings in recent days that purportedly show Russian soldiers resorting to injuring themselves in an effort to get pulled from the war. On Thursday, Ukraine’s Security Service released another recording said to reveal that trend. In the purportedly intercepted call between two Russian soldiers, one of the men tells his friend that fighting is getting more and more intense by the day, and despite daily fatalities, the military leadership is not providing backup. “Take someone else’s weapon, a Ukrainian one, and shoot yourself in the legs,” his friend advises.

5/20/2022,"On Thursday, the three leaders of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation addressed the controversy that has surrounded the organization over the last month. When it was revealed in April by New York Magazine that BLM founder Patrisse Cullors secretly purchased a $5.8 million mansion in Southern California, outraged quickly ensued. In an effort of transparency, the 990s were posted on the Black Lives Matter foundation website.
 Cicley Gay, D’Zhane Parker and Shalomyah Bowers held a media roundtable discussion to address the organizational finances. Bowers, whose consulting firm received $2 million, according to the tax documents, explained how that’s typical in businesses: “Less than 10% [of the $79 million raised] were dedicated to overhead and operational expenses, which is in stark contracts to the 30% in overhead costs from organizations that get A ratings from nonprofit watchdog organizations like GuideStar.” Read more &#39;You Got McDonald&#39;s Money?&#39; and Other Phrases We Remember From Childhood &lt;i&gt;Black in the Day&lt;/i&gt;: Barrettes, Blue Magic and Other Ways We Laid Our Hair Cheat Sheet: What is Critical Race Theory? Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce He went onto explain more of how BLM funds have been distributed. “Over $25 million has been reinvested into the Black community; that broken down represents over $10 million in grants to Black led frontline organizations, truly doing the work of abolition on the ground. Over $13 million in grants [has gone] to Black Lives Matter chapters. Nearly $3 million have gone out in grants to impacted family foundations. $3 million has gone out directly for relief to Black people who were struggling during COVID when the administration was providing stimulus checks.” The house purchased by Cullors was also addressed, though Gay clarified that her and Parker joined BLM after it was purchased. Bowers explained how the mansion serves as a house for the “Black Joy Creators Fellowship.” “The creator’s house was purchased as a space of our own with the intention of providing housing and studio space for recipients of the Black Joy Creators Fellowship in service to Black culture. The intention is that Black creatives will have an opportunity to launch online content,” Gay added. When asked if the house was currently occupied by anyone, the board members confirmed that it wasn’t. As far as Cullors’ connection to Black Lives Matter goes: “Patrice is always honored as a movement founder and one of the co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement and hashtag, she stepped down last year. She has no legal connection to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. We as the three board members are leading the foundation,” Gay explained. The filings also revealed that nearly $1 million that media production to Trap Heals LLC, a company founded by Damon Turner who has a child with Cullors. Nearly $840,000 went to Cullors’ brother Paul for security, something BLM will continue to pay for. “He still does currently serve as the organization’s head of security. The concept of having people you know and trust and have done work with in the past as employees or vendors and consultants within an organization or just on your team is not new,” Bowers shared. Cullors isn’t officially attached to BLM anymore, though Parker saying they’re using her legacy with the organization as a turning point. “We are continuing to look over all of those...those learned lessons and figuring out how we could do it better in the future. We are planning to handle things differently moving forward.”",Business/The Root,Black Lives Matter Tries To Explain The Millions And That Mansion,https://news.yahoo.com/black-lives-matter-tries-explain-184100128.html
5/20/2022,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A deputy in South Carolina whose police van was swept away by floodwaters in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, drowning two women seeking mental health treatment trapped in a cage in the back was sentenced Thursday to 18 years in prison. A Marion County jury found former Horry County deputy Stephen Flood guilty of two counts of involuntary manslaughter and two counts of reckless homicide. Judges ordered Wendy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, to be involuntarily committed the day they died in September 2018, but their families said they were not violent. Newton was only seeking medicine for her fear and anxiety and Green’s family said she was committed to a mental facility at a regular mental health appointment by a counselor she had never seen before. Flood, 69, was sentenced about 30 minutes after the verdict and after several relatives of the women said his decision to press forward with the shortest route left an impossible-to-fix hole in their lives. “This was a deliberate act set in motion by a pompous, stubborn man,” Green's sister Donnela Green-Johnson told the judge. “He abused the trust my sister, Nikki, Wendy and the state of South Carolina entrusted him with. And for what? To save time.” Circuit Court Judge William Seales sentenced Flood to five years in prison on each involuntary manslaughter charge and four years on each reckless homicide charge and ordered the sentences served back-to-back. The floodwaters swept the police van off its wheels in September 2018 and pinned it against a guardrail, preventing the women from being able to get out the sliding door they used to enter the van. Flood and a deputy with him did not have a key to a second door and there was no emergency escape hatch, according to testimony from the trial streamed by WMBF-TV. The deputies said they spoke to the women and tried to keep them calm for about an hour as the water kept rising before it got too dangerous and rescuers could no longer hear them. “How awful must that have been to sit there and wait for your own death?” Solicitor Ed Clements said in his closing argument Thursday. While other factors like an emergency radio that failed to notify rescuers of the van's exact location contributed to the deaths, Clements said the drownings all came out of Flood’s reckless decision to drive 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) through water. National guard troops put up barricades on U.S. Highway 76 just outside Nichols, but Flood drove around them after briefly talking to the soldiers. Clements read from Flood's statement to investigators that he felt like once he was in the water, he could not turn around because he could no longer see the edge of the highway and was worried about running into a ditch hidden by the water. “Maybe it wounded his pride or stubbornness. I don’t know. He pushed forward into water that was not just standing in a tall puddle, but it was rushing, crossing the guardrail. All of it was the Little Pee Dee River by then,” Clements said. Flood's lawyer said while it was a terrible tragedy, others were trying to unfairly blame just the former deputy instead of the equipment problems, the troops that waived them around the barricades and supervisors who knew dangerous flooding was starting and sent him even though taking the women to the mental health facilities was not an emergency. ""I ask that you resist the urge to try to give justice to those two ladies by giving injustice to this good man,"" defense attorney Jarrett Bouchette said. “They want to make him a scapegoat for this accident.” Flood did not testify, but before he was sentenced told the judge he tried everything he could to keep the women calm as the waters rose and help was slow to arrive. “It was a series of mistakes on my part and other people that led me to that point and I’m sorry for what happened to the girls,” Flood said. Flood and the deputy with him, Joshua Bishop, were eventually rescued from the top of the transport van, authorities said. Bishop will stand trial for two counts of involuntary manslaughter at a later date. They tried to shoot the locks off the second door, but it still would not open. The delay in getting help was costly too. A firefighter testified they were able to cut the roof off the van and started working on the cage, but the water got higher and faster and it was too dangerous to continue. Newton's son Charles said he hated that Flood had to learn to follow the rules and use common sense at such a steep price. “I can forgive, but I cannot forget. Fortunately, I still remember my mom as a happy woman, a joyful woman who loved her family,"" he said. “But you, Mr. Flood, will remember my mom by hearing her screams in the back of that van."" ___ Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP.",U.S./Associated Press,Ex-deputy gets 18 years after detainees drown in locked van,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-deputy-gets-18-years-202543628.html
5/20/2022,"A Ukrainian medic smuggled footage of Mariupol's horrors to AP reporters before they left the city. Yuliia Paievska's footage showed her tending to wounded Ukrainians — and even Russians. A day after she snuck out the video, Russian forces abducted her. Her whereabouts are unknown. A Ukrainian medic was captured by Russian forces in mid-March after sneaking out video evidence of the war's devastation. Yuliia Paievska — known in Ukraine as Taira — recorded 256 gigabytes of harrowing and graphic footage from a helmet camera in Mariupol over a two-week period during Russia's siege on the city, the Associated Press reported on Thursday. Taira, 53, handed off the camera card to an AP team. The team of journalists — one of whom hid the evidence in a tampon — made their way through over a dozen Russian checkpoints before they escaped the strategic southern port city in a humanitarian convoy, the report said. Taira was captured by Russian troops the next day, the report continued. Russian broadcasters aired a video of her and accused her of trying to flee the city in disguise. She hasn't been seen since. The footage, published in Thursday's report, documents the efforts of Taira's team to save the lives of wounded Ukrainians — and even Russians. In one video, a team of medics could be seen trying to save a young boy's life. He didn't survive, and Taira turned away — placing a bloodied hand on a wall. The helmet footage picked up sounds of her sobbing, as medical devices beeped in the background. She then shut the boy's eyes. Another video published by the AP showed Taira removing bloodied gloves from her hands, before moving to footage of her hustling down a hallway behind first responders as they pushed a stretcher. The following frame showed Taira tending to the wounded and bloodied face of a man — opening his eyelid with extreme caution as he took deep breaths. More footage from Taira's helmet camera showed a soldier being carried away on a stretcher, before cutting to a shot of a soldier's bloodied face getting bandaged by medics. In the next frame, medics performed CPR on an unidentified person. Since her abduction, a website was published showing how long Taira has been in Russian captivity since March 16 — 65 days and counting. Efforts between Ukraine and Russia to involve her in a prisoner swap have stalled. Her husband, Vadim Puzanov, told the AP that he had little to no knowledge of her whereabouts or condition. The website said Russian state media had tried to use Taira in disinformation and propaganda campaigns. ""Accusing a volunteer medic of all mortal sins, including organ trafficking, is already outrageous propaganda — I don't even know who it's for,"" Puzanov said. Medics, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities have consistently been targeted by Russian forces throughout the three-month war. Editor's Note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated how the camera footage was smuggled out of Mariupol, Ukraine. The camera card was handed off by the medic to a team of AP journalists, one of whom hid it in a tampon.

5/20/2022,"A TikToker is going viral after sharing how Airbnb arbitrage properties changed her life. The post comes from The KarWells (@thekarwells), two friends who run a successful real estate business and a TikTok page full of investing tips. In one of the page’s most popular clips, Sarah Glidewell, one half of The KarWells, recently explained how she went from making $50,000 per year to over $100,000 from Airbnb rental properties. Bitcoin ETFs: What are they and how to invest in them? Her clip is just the latest in a recent trend of TikTokers embracing financial transparency on the app. In one video, a business owner detailed how she pays all of her employees — including herself — the same salary. In another, a Google employee shared how he went from having a 1.2 GPA in college to making $344,000 a year. Glidewell’s financial situation, she explained, came largely from Airbnb arbitrage properties. Typically, Airbnb hosts own the properties they rent through the vacation app. However, Airbnb arbitrage is the process of renting a property and subletting it to Airbnb guests. The process can be difficult to pull off due to legal restrictions and issues with landlords, but, as Glidewell shared, it can also be very profitable. In her clip, Glidewell explained how she was making $50,000 at her day job in 2019. Despite people encouraging her to save up for a new car, she managed to put away $20,000 to invest in her business idea instead. She used that money to start renting and furnishing four different properties, which she then listed on Airbnb. Less than three years later, she’s making between $7,000 and $15,000 per month in profit. “Had I listened to everyone else,” she said. “I’d have a two and a half-year-old vehicle, I’d still be at a nine-to-five. … All I’m saying is, stop trading what you really want for what you want right now.” Check out our men's beach and swimwear summer style guide: The business model clearly transformed Glidewell’s financial situation — The KarWells’ TikTok bio says, “Airbnb changed our lives” — but, it also left TikTokers with plenty of questions. Specifically, commenters wanted to know how, and under what circumstances, arbitrage is legal. There are local and state laws that disallow sub-leasing, as well as some places where pricing may make it difficult. Additionally, many leases forbid rental arbitrage. As Glidewell explained in the video’s comments, she had to call and negotiate with landlords directly in order to strike a deal where she could re-lease her rental. As with many recent financial stories on the app, TikTokers praised Glidewell for the insight. “Saving 40% of your salary is very impressive! Congratulations,” one user wrote. “Such a great example of true investing,” another added.
