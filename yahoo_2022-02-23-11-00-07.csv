2/23/2022,"It Figures is Yahoo Life's body image series, delving into the journeys of influential and inspiring figures as they explore what body confidence, body neutrality and self-love mean to them. Mia Khalifa's public identity has long been associated with her body after she appeared in a Pornhub video in 2014 and became the most viewed actress on the site. After speaking out about the trauma that she experienced as a result and how she's working to move forward in her life, the 29-year-old is reclaiming her body and her relationship with it through her latest work with Playboy Centerfold. Khalifa shares her complicated history with Yahoo Life, explaining just how her body impacted her self-worth throughout her upbringing. It even made her feel more distant from her American classmates when she immigrated from Lebanon as a child and allowed her to seek attention by other means. ""I grew up very overweight and I didn’t start losing weight until I was like 18, 19, 20,"" she says. ""It made me insecure, it made me act hypersexual when the opportunity presented itself. Also, [I was] constantly craving validation."" She recalls seeking attention from men specifically as a means to feel good about herself at her lowest moments. ""I did not feel good about myself so I just let anyone have access to it,"" she recalls. ""I only thought that I was worthy of just existing when someone else desired me or seemingly desired me."" Still, she wouldn't come to understand these things until she had a life-altering encounter with a man who brought her into the realm of sex work. In her experience, she was made to feel completely out of control of not only her body but also the perception that people throughout the world had of her. ""It just sunk me into a depression and it sunk me into a spiral of shame,"" she says when reflecting on the vitriol she was faced with online and in real life after performing in a PornHub video while wearing a hijab. ""I still didn’t have the confidence to really take claim over my body."" In the years since, however, she's made an effort to do just that. Khalifa explains that her relationship with her body became better over time, noting that age made a huge difference in her experience. ""Just getting older and realizing what matters and what doesn't,"" she says. ""I love my imperfections. I feel like I’ve done the body modifications that I’ve wanted for a long time and thought hard on. I'm happy. I like the way I'm aging, I like the way I’m growing, I like the way I'm fluctuating."" She even came to realize that she could still share images of her body on social media and other platforms in a way that allows her to celebrate her figure and the new approach she has to body image, rather than feeling embarrassed by it. ""Maneuvering my way around the contradiction of feeling like I was powerless when I was in that time of my life versus doing it now in a completely different way really comes down to my confidence,"" she explains. ""The difference is now, it is all for me. The only thing that gets shown to the public or goes out into the public sphere is something that makes me feel empowered or sexy or confident or comfortable."" Now, her work with Playboy Centerfold, a creator-led digital platform dedicated to creative freedom, artistic expression and sex-positivity, is something that she looks to as beautiful and empowering rather than shameful.    A post shared by Centerfold (@playboycenterfold) ""I wouldn't say that I necessarily overcame my fear of putting my body out there. What I would say is the circumstances behind how it was happening became more in my control,"" Khalifa explains. ""My favorite part about what I'm doing now with Centerfold is that I plan everything, I decide what I wear, I decide what photos are taken, I decide everything, down to every little tiny detail. And that's what makes it fun and that’s what makes it empowering."" Most importantly, she can exercise caution when it comes to the message that young women are faced with on social media as Khalifa uses her voice and her imperfections to start an important conversation about body image alongside her display of relatively newfound body acceptance. ""Part of me worries about today's generation with the whole FaceTune era, all of the plastic surgery being pushed on them. But another part of me just also sees the positive side of that, which is more conversations around body positivity and acceptance. And [a] better relationship with food and yourself,"" she says. Ultimately, she wants people to learn from her past mistakes by accepting them as a part of her journey. ""I hope that the one thing that others learn from me is it is not a death sentence. You can do whatever you want, whatever you want,"" she says. ""As long as you ignore all of the voices telling you you can't, literally nothing is stopping you."" -Video produced by Olivia Schneider Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

2/23/2022,"Editor's Note: This article has been updated to include that Rex Meeker had also turned himself over to police.

A plastic surgeon and a nurse anesthetist in Colorado are now facing criminal charges in connection to a disastrous breast augmentation surgery that led to a young woman’s death in October 2020.

Emmalyn Nguyen, 18, underwent the procedure at Dr. Geoffrey Kim’s Colorado Aesthetics and Plastic Surgery in Greenwood Village on Aug. 1, 2019. After receiving anesthesia, she reportedly experienced two cardiac arrests and ended up with brain damage.

Nguyen’s family’s lawyer, David Woodruff, alleged that nurse Rex Meeker had left the then-18-year-old unattended for 15 minutes after administering the anesthesia. Meeker was reportedly involved in a similar incident in 2007.

Kim, who reportedly revived Nguyen after her first cardiac arrest, allegedly misled her family into thinking that “everything is fine.”



“He said everything is fine, Emmalyn is fine, everything is good. She’s young, she’s healthy, she’ll be okay, it’s just taking her long to wake up,” Nguyen’s mother, Lynn Fam, told CBS Denver.

Nguyen remained in a vegetative state prior to her death in October 2020. She reportedly developed pneumonia in her nursing home and went into cardiac arrest multiple times over a 24-hour period.

Last Wednesday, the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office announced that Kim had surrendered himself over to the police following an arrest warrant. He was charged with criminally negligent homicide and first-degree aggravated assault, both categorized as felonies.

Meeker, on the other hand, was solely charged with manslaughter. He turned himself in on Friday but he was released shortly after on an undisclosed bond, as per KDVR.



“We opened this criminal case in August 2019. The investigation has taken more than two years to complete and involved dozens of interviews and search warrants,” said Captain of Investigations Travis Stewart. “Our hope is that this will be the beginning of bringing justice and a sense of closure to Emmalyn’s family.”

In a statement, the family shared that they are hopeful about ""finally getting justice for Emmalyn.""

“Even though it will never bring our daughter back, at least this will help others from getting hurt and prevent ruining other families' lives,"" the family said, according to CBS News. “We still haven't been able to get closure from Emmalyn's death. Hopefully bringing criminal charges will bring out the truth about what happened and will bring justice for Emmalyn.”

Kim, who turned himself in with his attorney, was also released after posting a $5,000 bond. Last year, he and Meeker agreed to pay $1 million each to Nguyen’s family in a civil settlement, as per CBS Denver.

Bethel in 2021 was crowned Miss Alabama for America Strong and was a conservative personality. A GoFundMe launched to support her family has raised over $44,000 in less than a week. The conservative media personality Zoe Sozo Bethel, who was last year crowned Miss Alabama for America Strong, died days after she fell out of the window of a three-story building, the Miami Police Department told Insider on Tuesday. Police told Insider they responded to a ""possible suicide attempt"" on February 11 at 12 a.m. The woman, identified as 27-year-old Bethel, was transported to the Jackson Memorial Hospital ""in critical condition,"" the statement said. A week later, on Friday, Bethel died, and her cause of death was ""blunt force trauma,"" police said. Her manner of death was ruled ""accidental"" by the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner, according to the police statement. ""This was a tragic accident, and no foul play is suspected,"" the statement said. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner's Office did not respond to Insider's request for comment. Bethel's death was first announced in an Instagram post to her account on Monday. ""On Friday, February 18, 2022, at approximately 5:30AM Eastern time in Miami, Florida, our beloved Zoe Sozo Bethel passed from this life into the next as a result of succumbing to her injuries,"" the post said.

Five days earlier, on Wednesday, her account shared a photo with a caption that said Bethel had been involved in an accident on February 10. Doctors said Bethel was in a coma and said she sustained brain damage that couldn't ""be repaired,"" according to the post. None of the posts detailed the nature of the accident. Bethel had over 25,000 followers on Instagram. She frequently posted about and was an ambassador for Turning Point USA, the conservative nonprofit founded by Bill Montgomery and Charlie Kirk. ""We are honored to have known Zoe Bethel. She has been a pillar in the Conservative movement, always moving with grace and wisdom. She has inspired many, and her legacy will continue to touch the hearts of people everywhere,"" Turning Point USA said in a statement. She was crowned Miss Alabama for America Strong in 2021, according to People. The Miss Alabama for America Strong Instagram account mourned Bethel in a post Monday, writing that ""the world lost a queen"" and that ""she was a light in this world and we are heartbroken over the loss of such a bright and beautiful woman."" Bethel was also a commentator for Right Side Broadcasting Network, a conservative media streaming company, and associated with Liberty University's Falkirk Center and the right-wing group Project Veritas, according to her Instagram. Her family launched a GoFundMe last week to raise money for medical expenses, funeral and memorial expenses, as well as resources for Bethel's daughter. The fundraiser, which has so far raised more than $44,000 as of Tuesday afternoon has a goal of raising $500,000. The GoFundMe organizer did not respond to a request for comment.

2/23/2022,"By Will Dunham (Reuters) - A fossil jawbone peeking out from a limestone seashore on Scotland's Isle of Skye led scientists to discover the skeleton of a pterosaur that showed that these remarkable flying reptiles got big tens of millions of years earlier than previously known. Researchers said on Tuesday this pterosaur, named Dearc sgiathanach, lived roughly 170 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, soaring over lagoons in a subtropical landscape and catching fish and squid with crisscrossing teeth perfect for snaring slippery prey. Its scientific name, pronounced ""jark ski-an-ach,"" means ""winged reptile"" in Gaelic. With a wingspan of about 8 feet (2.5 meters), Dearc was the Jurassic's largest-known pterosaur and the biggest flying creature that had inhabited Earth to that point in time. Some pterosaurs during the subsequent Cretaceous Period achieved much greater dimensions - as big as fighter jets. But Dearc shows that this scaling up had its origins much earlier. A forensic analysis of its bones indicated this Dearc individual was not fully grown and could have had a 10-foot (3-meter) wingspan as an adult. Dearc weighed very little - probably below 22 pounds (10 kg) - thanks to its hollow, lightweight bones and slender structure, said University of Edinburgh paleontology doctoral student Natalia Jagielska, lead author of the research published in the journal Current Biology. It had an elongated skull and a long, stiff tail. An arsenal of sharp teeth formed a cage when it bit down on prey. Pterosaurs, which lived alongside the dinosaurs, were the first of three vertebrate groups to achieve powered flight, appearing about 230 million years ago. Birds appeared about 150 million years ago and bats around 50 million years ago. Pterosaurs are some of the rarest vertebrates in the fossil record owing to their fragile bones, some with walls thinner than a sheet of paper. ""Our specimen, anomalously, is well preserved - retaining its original three dimensions and being almost complete, and still articulated as it would be when alive. Such state of preservation is exceptionally rare in pterosaurs,"" Jagielska said. Up until when Dearc lived, pterosaurs generally had been modest in size, many about the size of a seagull. The prevailing wisdom among scientists had been that pterosaurs did not reach Dearc's size until the Cretaceous, some 25 million years later, with the appearance of creatures like Huanhepterus, Feilongus and Elanodactylus. Quetzalcoatlus, appearing about 68 million years ago, boasted a wingspan of about 36 feet (11 meters), like an F-16 fighter. ""In the Cretaceous, some pterosaurs got enormous. These were some of the most superlative animals that ever lived. Dearc was not close to them in size or grandeur, but it was 100 million years older. Evolution needed time to make such giants,"" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte said. ""One idea is that pterosaurs only got larger after birds evolved, when the two groups were competing with each other for the aerial niches. But Dearc tells us that pterosaurs already got to be the size of today's largest birds even before the first birds evolved, so it throws a wrench into this idea,"" Brusatte added. In Dearc's time, Britain was closer to the equator and existed as a series of smaller separate islands. Dearc lived alongside a menagerie of plant-eating and meat-eating dinosaurs, early mammals and marine reptiles. Dearc was discovered in 2017, with the fossil jutting out from a limestone intertidal zone after the tide had gone down. ""We were gobsmacked,"" Brusatte said. ""Nothing like this had ever been found in Scotland."" They battled the tide, first using hammers and chisels and then diamond-tipped saws. But the tide interrupted before the skeleton could be fully extracted. ""The tide came in with a vengeance, and we cried as the waves lapped over the fossil,"" Brusatte said. ""We thought we lost it. But we decided to come back around midnight when the tide was down again, using our headlamps and flashlights. We were shocked and relieved to see the bones still there as the waves receded.""

2/23/2022,"A Chinese woman purportedly studying in Brisbane, Australia, was recently filmed rejecting the claim of Uyghur Muslims being detained in ""concentration camps"" in China as she took down posters featuring photos of the Tiananmen Square protests created to support Hong Kong’s democracy.

The incident, filmed by Billie Kugelman, chief editor of student newspaper Semper Floreat at the University of Queensland, was shared online by Drew Pavlou, an outspoken critic of the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) who is running to “represent Queensland in the Australian senate.”
 


The video shows the unidentified woman, whose face is blurred, arguing with Kugelman as she tears down posters from the university’s Lennon Wall.

“You are ruining my liberty. I don't want to show my face,” the woman tells Kugelman. “I just want to show that I'm not (afraid) to show my freedom.”

Kugelmen responds by saying her face will be blurred in the video, then says, “Can you tell me a bit about why you think it's right to rip these down?”

“Do you think you are right to tell these lies to the students, especially those teenagers?” the woman replies, referring to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and its photos featured on the posters, one of them being the iconic photo of the ""Tank Man.""

“I don't think they are lies,” Kugleman responds. He asks her if she knows what happened during the massacre – which occurred around 33 years ago – to which she replies, “No, I don't know about that because it happened 40 to 50 years ago... It happened decades ago. I'm just thinking about now, thinking about the future, the students, the teenagers. What's your big influence by this wall?”

“I think the intent is to make them think twice about what’s happening,” Kugelman replies. He eventually brings up the Uyghurs, a Muslim-majority ethnic minority in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) that has been described as the ""most persecuted ethnicity"" in China, as NextShark previously reported.

“As far as I'm aware, there are Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps,” Kugelman tells the woman after she brings out her phone and fails to show him what “what China is looking like.”

The woman then laughs exaggeratedly at the term “concentration camps.”

""You have jails in Australia, you have jails in Australia,"" the woman says as she walks out on Kugelman.

Pavlou identified the woman as a “Chinese international student” in his tweet on Thursday, but Kugelman corrected him, saying that the woman claimed she was not a student of the university.

2/23/2022,"By Tuvan Gumrukcu and Ece Toksabay ANKARA (Reuters) - When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his decision to recognise two breakaway regions in east Ukraine as independent, NATO member and Black Sea neighbour Turkey swiftly criticised the move, but stopped short of announcing any punitive measures. Turkey is in a unique bind: it has good ties with both Ukraine and Russia, but also opposes sanctions in principle, just as the West is poised to slap them on Moscow as long promised. The crisis leaves President Tayyip Erdogan balancing those diplomatic relations along with his duties within NATO, while also protecting Turkey's beleaguered economy from back-to-back shocks after a currency crisis in December. Any step too far against Moscow, and Ankara risks upsetting important Russian energy supplies, trade and tourism, analysts say. ""It is the prospect of a prolonged bloodless conflict or substantive sanctions on Russia's energy exports that could hurt Turkey deeply (and threaten) economic stability,"" said Atilla Yesilada, Istanbul-based analyst at GlobalSource Partners. Striking the balance Turkey employed for decades, Erdogan often highlights his friendship with Putin but has warned Russia against an invasion and offered to mediate the crisis. He has also criticised the West's handling of things as a hindrance to peace. On Tuesday, Turkey called Russia's recognition of Ukraine's separatists an unacceptable violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ergodan - who visited Kyiv this month - rejected it and called on parties to respect international laws, likely his sharpest language towards Moscow since a crisis over Turkey's downing of a Russian jet near Turkey's Syrian border in 2015. Erdogan and Putin have since warmed and Turkey bought Russian missile defences in 2019, which prompted U.S. anger and sanctions. Since then, Ankara has opposed sanctions against any country. ""Sanctions against Russia are useless. You only postpone the problems,"" Turkish Presidential Spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told Die Welt at the weekend, adding ""new rules and principles"" were needed for both Russia and the West to ""feel safe"". ""Russia feels threatened by NATO,"" he added. While cooperating with Russia in energy and trade, Turkey has also sold sophisticated drones to Ukraine and inked a deal to co-produce more, angering Moscow. Complicating diplomacy, Turkey opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya even as it forges cooperation on the ground there. It also opposes Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, and its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions in Georgia as independent. VULNERABLE LIRA Russia supplied some 46% of Turkey's gas last year, and Ankara is looking to strike shorter-duration gas deals with Moscow to relieve import costs. Inflation has soared to near 50%, hurting Erdogan's poll standing, after the lira crash. The currency slipped to its lowest since mid-January on concerns over economic fallout including for Turkey's tourism sector, for which Russians are the top arrivals. Without elaborating, Erdogan has said Turkey will do what is necessary as a NATO member in the event of a Russian invasion. The 1936 Montreux Convention gives Turkey control over the straits within its borders, and during peacetime guarantees access for civilian vessels to and from the Black Sea. It also limits access of naval warships, helping to protect the Black Sea from militarisation. Can Kasapoglu, director of security and defence studies programme at EDAM, said Turkey had made clear it backs Ukraine. But a Russian troop buildup in the Black Sea should ""really worry"" it, especially the risk of a change of leadership in Ukraine, he said. ""In this case, defence technology cooperation with Turkey may be suspended, as Russia is uncomfortable with a NATO nation's defence technological and industrial base developing ties with the post-Soviet space,"" he said.

Soon after, he felt abdominal pain and his skin turned a shade of purple, according to a report by The New England Journal of Medicine. The teenager was admitted to a hospital for ""shock, multiple organ failure, and rash,” and his condition quickly declined. He experienced abnormal breathing, high blood pressure and vomiting.

The Centers for Disease and Control Prevention warns it can “lead to death in as little as a few hours.” Over the course of his hospital stay, his condition worsened and he developed necrosis, the death of tissue and cells. At that point, doctors had to amputate his legs and fingers, according to the report. He also needed a pacemaker for 13 days to treat his cardiac dysfunction. Experts have warned against the dangers of improperly storing leftover rice because items such as rice and pasta contain a bacterium called Bacillus cereus. The bacteria produces a toxin when heated and left out too long, according to the CDC. In 2008, a teenager died in his sleep after eating leftover pasta that wasn't refrigerated overnight, a case that was reported in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. The medical team learned that although the Massachusetts student had received a first dose of the meningococcal vaccine, he never received the recommended booster.

He also said he had an occasional treat like a steak, which experts say can keep a diet sustainable. The bodybuilding legend Arnold Schwarzenegger said he'd been eating a mostly plant-based diet for the past five years and it significantly lowered his cholesterol. Schwarzenegger said in a recent edition of his email newsletter that about 80% of what he ate was vegan. He said he made an occasional exception for steak or Austrian wiener schnitzel — leaving room for treats in your diet can help avoid restriction and help you stick to a diet long term, experts previously told Insider. The seven-time Mr. Olympia has been outspoken about the benefits of a vegan diet for health, inspiring a generation of vegan bodybuilders to build muscle on plant-based diets. He said it had helped him feel ""healthier and younger overall"" and aided in reducing his levels of LDL cholesterol, a type of cholesterol sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol because it's linked to higher risk of heart disease. ""My bad cholesterol number is so low that my doctor thought I might be a different person,"" Schwarzenegger said in the newsletter. Certain animal-based foods like fatty cuts of meat, processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, and dairy products like cheese are linked to higher cholesterol levels. In contrast, veggies, especially leafy greens, and foods like whole grains, berries, and walnuts may help lower cholesterol without medication.

2/23/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A lawyer for a woman who accused former President Donald Trump of raping her in the mid-1990s and then filed a defamation lawsuit against him said Tuesday she will not seek to depose Trump prior to trial because it would cause unnecessary delay, but added that a DNA sample was still being sought. Attorney Roberta Kaplan first made the revelation in Manhattan federal court during a pretrial hearing before explaining the decision to reporters outside the court as her client, E. Jean Carroll, stood by her side. A deposition, Kaplan said, would “inevitably result in an inordinate amount of delay.” “We want the case to go forward,” she said. Attorney Alina Habba, who represented Trump at the hearing, said outside court that she had not previously heard that Carroll's lawyers did not want a deposition, a proceeding in which lawyers in civil cases question likely witnesses under oath prior to trial. “It's surprising,” Habba said. As for a DNA sample, Habba said: “None has been demanded.” A judge has ruled that former President Donald Trump and two of his children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump, must give depositions in New York Attorney General Letitia James' investigation into their company's financial practices and possible allegations of fraud. CBS New York has details. Kaplan, though, said the DNA sample had been requested after the case was first filed in state court, and the demand still exists after it was moved to federal court. She said she would be “more than perfectly happy” to wait to interview Trump at trial, which she estimated could occur in as little as six months, after some near-term legal obstacles are cleared. The Associated Press generally does not identify people alleging sexual assault, but Carroll has consented to being named in the media. She told reporters outside court that she was looking forward to the trial on behalf of all women “who have been grabbed and groped, assaulted and raped by men in power and are silenced.” “And we are looking to bring justice, at least in this one case, against a powerful man,” she said. Carroll said she would “never settle, never.” “This is about principle. It's about a powerful man assaulting and raping a woman and then getting away with it. That's not right,” she said. Carroll in a June 2019 book said Trump raped her in the mid-1990s in an upscale Manhattan department store. The book excerpt prompted Trump to deny the allegations and question Carroll’s credibility and motivations in a statement from his White House press office, comments in an Oval Office interview and statements to the media as he boarded a helicopter for Camp David. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule eventually on Trump’s request that the United States take his place as the defendant in the lawsuit. The U.S. Justice Department has asserted that Trump cannot be held personally liable for “crude and disrespectful” remarks he made about Carroll because his remarks were made as he was carrying out his duties as president. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who presided over Tuesday's hearing, ruled last October that Trump cannot use a law protecting federal employees from being sued individually for things they do within the scope of their employment. He also has rejected a request by Trump's attorneys that the progression of the lawsuit, including depositions, be delayed until the 2nd Circuit rules on whether Trump can be replaced as the defendant. On Tuesday, the judge seemed to have little patience for arguments by Trump's lawyers saying that Trump should be able to countersue Carroll under a law sometimes used to challenge defamation lawsuits that unfairly make claims. “I question whether you have the right to do what you want to do,” he said, noting that the lawyers were seeking to countersue more than a year after the case was filed.",Politics/Associated Press,"Donald Trump's DNA, not deposition sought in defamation suit",https://news.yahoo.com/ex-president-donald-trumps-deposition-232122750.html

The Texas resident told TODAY Food that her daughter, who wishes to remain anonymous, was studying by herself at a Starbucks in Corpus Christi on a Saturday night. “She wanted to get out of the house and go sit and study somewhere. She likes to go study at coffee shops,” she wrote in an email. In her Facebook post, Roberson explained that a barista handed her daughter “an extra hot chocolate someone forgot to pick up” after the stranger started talking to her. The teenager told her mother about the incident as soon as she got home and it warmed her heart. ""She was holding the cup and knew that I would love that someone did that for her,"" Roberson said. ""It made me feel so grateful that the Starbucks employees were watching out for her. As a mom, that is my worst fear that something would happen to my child and nobody would be there to help."" Roberson’s daughter told her that the adult man lingered for a while and talked “fairly loudly.” “It sounded like he was quite animated. I believe this is what alerted the employees. He had also not come in with my daughter, so they knew she probably did not know him,” she explained. The teenager appreciated the barista's kind gesture and let them know that she felt safe. Eventually, the man became aware that she was communicating with the staff and went about his business, leaving the 18-year-old alone. TODAY reached out to Starbucks for further detail, but the company declined to comment. Roberson said she didn't think her story would go viral, and that she only wanted to express her gratitude for the thoughtful employees. But she's glad it's put a positive spotlight on local workers. ""I am incredibly grateful to the staff there. I hope that we can all learn from them and be willing to help anyone who seems that they might need help,"" she said.

2/23/2022,"A Chinese movie released just before Valentine’s Day which depicts South Korean speed skaters as rule-breaking bullies has caused outrage among South Korean citizens, prompting a professor to raise the issue to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

""Fly, Skating Star"" was released on the Chinese platform iQiyi on Feb. 12, days after the Winter Olympics’ recent speed skating disqualification scandal occurred.

The film follows the story of skating genius Cheng Huan and short-track speed skater Shen Bingxin as they participate in an Asian competition to qualify for the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Cheng and Shen need to overcome a significant obstacle – a team of South Korean skaters who trip Cheng and injure his eye with a skate blade – to achieve their dream of representing China at the Olympics.

Earlier this month, South Korean athletes Hwang Dae-heon and Lee June-seo were disqualified for an illegal late pass and lane change during the men’s 1,000-meter semifinal event. The disqualification helped Team China win gold.

The Korean Sport & Olympic Committee (KSOC) announced that it will file an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over the “unfairness” of the event’s judging.

Seo Kyung-duk, a professor of general education at Sungshin Women's University, has accused Beijing of ""stirring up hatred against Korea"" after the movie caused outrage in the country, The Korea Times reported.

In a recent Facebook post, Seo said he has raised the issue to IOC President Thomas Bach and other IOC members via email, saying that Beijing’s decision to release the movie is “a violation of the Olympic spirit.”

“How can a country hosting the Olympic Games incite hatred against a neighboring country to evoke patriotism among its people like this?” Seo said.

“I asked the IOC to give a warning to the Beijing city authorities and the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG), so that an incident like this would not occur again in the future,"" he added.

Chinese state-run outlet Global Times accused Seo of playing the “newest trick to hype anti-China sentiment” in its headline for its story about the professor’s objection to the movie.

“Seo’s [Facebook] post soon became a hot topic on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo as it closely followed controversial penalties for South Korean short track speed skaters at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, which had been used by some South Korean politicians to hype hatred against China,” the Global Times story reads.

2/23/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China is concerned about the ""worsening"" situation in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday, repeating his call for all parties to show restraint and resolve differences through dialogue. Accelerating a crisis the West fears could spark a war, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered on Monday the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising them as independent. Russia denies any plan to attack Ukraine, but has threatened unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including a promise that its neighbour will never join NATO. The legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected, Wang, who is also a Chinese state councillor, told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a telephone call, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. ""The situation in Ukraine is worsening,"" Wang told Blinken. ""China once again calls on all parties to exercise restraint."" On the call, Blinken underscored the need to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity amid Russia's ""aggression"", said Ned Price, a U.S. State Department spokesperson. Earlier on Tuesday, China's embassy in Ukraine warned its nationals there not to venture into unstable areas, but stopped short of telling them to leave, as many other nations have advised their own citizens. [L1N2UX0EH] ""The Chinese embassy in Ukraine has issued a reminder to Chinese citizens and enterprises to strengthen security precautions,"" said Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesman. The embassy will ensure that dietary needs of Chinese citizens in Ukraine are met in a timely way, Wang said at a regular media briefing in response to a query about when China would pull out its citizens. China is closely following the evolving situation in Ukraine, Wang told the briefing, which drew more reporters than usual. TAIWAN, NORTH KOREA The United States should not include Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, in America's Indo-Pacific strategy, Wang told Blinken. This month, the United States said it would commit more diplomatic and security resources to the Indo-Pacific, and vowed to work with partners both in and outside the region to maintain peace and stability in the strait dividing Taiwan from China. The attempt to include Taiwan in the strategy to contain China is sending all the ""wrong signals"", Wang told Blinken on the telephone call, the foreign ministry said in its statement. Still, China is willing to manage its differences with the United States and stabilise two-way ties, Wang added. On Monday, China said it had placed Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Technologies Corp under sanctions over arms sales to Taiwan, in at least the third time it has announced punishments for the U.S. firms. Taiwan's foreign ministry said it would continue to urge the United States to keep selling the island weapons ""in the face of China's military threats and intimidation"". ""The U.S. provision to us of defensive weapons helps defend Taiwan's democracy and freedom, as well as ensures national security and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,"" spokesperson Joanne Ou told reporters on Tuesday. Blinken and Wang also spoke on developments in North Korea. China calls for direct dialogue between the United States and North Korea, and will, as always, seek to play a constructive role in promoting resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Wang said.

It's least the third time the country has penalised the firms, though no details were given of the latest measures. China said it had to act after the latest deal undermined ""peace and stability"" in the region. It regards the island as a breakaway province that must accept Chinese sovereignty. Beijing has never renounced the possibility of using force to achieve that goal. Over the past two years it has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure on the island's government. Now the effects of the sanctions may be largely symbolic, as the U.S. does not sell arms to China.

2/23/2022,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld WASHINGTON (Reuters) -If Russia further invades Ukraine, the Biden administration could deprive it of a vast swath of low- and high-tech U.S. and foreign-made goods, from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. President Joe Biden would achieve that by expanding the list of goods that require U.S. licenses before suppliers can ship them to Russia, and his administration would then deny those licenses, the people said. The measures, whose details have not previously been reported, are part of a suite of export control penalties that the United States has prepared to damage Russia's economy, targeting everything from lasers to telecoms equipment and maritime items. They were not announced on Tuesday as part of a round of sanctions unveiled by Biden to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for recognizing two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent and deploying troops into the regions to ""keep the peace."" But a senior administration official said, “if Putin escalates further, we will escalate further, using both financial sanctions and export controls, which we’ve yet to unveil.” The official added: ""Export controls are really potent because we’re talking about critical technology inputs that Russia needs to diversify its economy.” The official added that the United States is ""fully prepared with a very large number of countries across the world to implement those export control measures if the invasion proceeds."" The White House, and the Commerce Department, which oversees U.S. export controls, did not respond to requests for comment on details of the potential restrictions. The package, which was still being fine-tuned over the weekend and could change, could come even as some White House officials have pledged to spare the Russian consumer from the brunt of the penalties. The goal of the export control measures ""is really to degrade Russia's ability to have industrial production in a couple of key sectors,"" Peter Harrell, who sits on the White House's National Security Council, said in a speech last month. He said the administration was focused on industrial production and high-tech sectors ""rather than how do we sort of target the Russian people writ-large."" The administration has been vowing to hit Moscow with a potent cocktail of banking sanctions and export controls for weeks, in response to a massing of hundreds of thousands of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders. Reuters reported on Saturday that the Biden administration had also prepared a package of sanctions against Russia that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks. By far the most sweeping measure contained in the export controls package would take a page from restrictions placed on Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd under former President Donald Trump. It would dramatically expand the scope of the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), requiring firms that use U.S. tools to make technology overseas to obtain a U.S. license before shipping them to Russia. ""It's extraordinarily novel and has the potential for being far more significant than controls just on exports of these items from the United States,"" said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official. U.S. suppliers would also have to obtain licenses for certain Russia-bound items that do not currently require them, such as civil aircraft parts. Whether Europe would follow suit with similar measures remains to be seen. Japan said on Tuesday it stood ready to join the United States and other G7 industrialised nations in slapping sanctions on Russia. On Tuesday, Biden said the United States would impose sanctions against two large Russian financial institutions and Russian sovereign debt and against some Russian elites and their family members. On Monday, as an initial response to Putin's moves into eastern Ukraine, Biden vowed to end investment in and trade with the regions while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced initial sanctions targeting Russian banks and billionaires. Under changes proposed in the U.S. export control package, the license applications, in turn, would face a strict ""policy of denial"" standard of review, meaning only in rare cases would the administration approve them. In addition, Russian companies listed as so-called military end users for their alleged ties to the Russian military, including a handful of aircraft producers, would be added to a trade blacklist known as the entity list. That would broaden the scope of items the companies would need licenses to obtain. Finally, Washington would expand the scope of products that would need approval from the United States when sent to Russian military end users through an even broader application of the FDPR rule, subjecting to U.S. licenses requirements all items made abroad with U.S. tools and destined for companies that support the military. U.S. exports to Russia were under $5 billion in 2020, according to the Commerce Department, and already face many curbs. But the use of the FDPR rule dramatically expands the impact of the restrictions included in the package.

Ukrainian parents are taking measures to keep their children safe amid fears of a Russian invasion. This includes sending them to school with their blood types visible on stickers. The move comes after Russia said it would deploy troops in eastern Ukraine. In a Monday speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally acknowledged two of Ukraine's separatist regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, as independent states. He then ordered troops into the eastern Ukraine territories for ""peacekeeping."" Ukrainian journalist Olga Tokariuk tweeted Monday that Putin's speech was a ""declaration of war"" that has inspired Ukrainian parents to take additional precautions, with some now sending their kids to school better prepared if they require a blood transfusion. The conversation began on Facebook, Tokariuk tweeted. —Olga Tokariuk (@olgatokariuk) February 21, 2022 ""This was a debate in one of (many) closed groups on Facebook,"" Tokariuk told TODAY. ""Some schools actually made these stickers mandatory.""

2/23/2022,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency formed to protect wildlife, has taken an unprecedented step and marked for death a rare Florida panther known as FP 260. FP 260 is still alive, but has been targeted for capture and euthanasia, Craig Pittman reports for the Florida Phoenix. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. Driving the news: Because of an Immokalee rancher's persistent complaints that FP 260 was killing her calves, the federal agency decided the endangered panther should die, despite protests from biologists. ""FP 260 is the renegade panther with a taste for veal, unfortunately,"" one state biologist wrote, per Pittman, who reviewed some 400 agency emails about the panther. The big picture: The endangered Florida panther has been in decline in the last half century or so, from hunting before it was illegal, then from development and cars. There are around 200 Florida panthers left on the southern tip of the peninsula, a rebound from fewer than 30 in the 1990s. How it happened: FP 260 first caught biologists' attention after it was struck by a car in 2020 and crawled off the road and onto the Immokalee ranch of Liesa Priddy. FP 260 was treated by veterinarians, fitted with a tracking collar, then turned loose a few weeks later in the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge. Yes, but: Priddy, a former state wildlife commissioner, has complained about panthers killing her cows for a decade. She said FP 260 killed 10 of her calves in a matter of months. Annual losses to panthers topped $25,000, she reported. Her complaints reached the top levels of wildlife bureaucracy. Wildlife officials tried everything, from hazing the animal to firing ""shell crackers"" to scare it off. They eventually relocated the panther 18 miles south, but it returned to the ranch. In late December, federal panther coordinator David Shindle wrote that his agency had determined FP 260 should be ""permanently"" removed from the wild after Priddy said she feared the panther would attack a human. Shindle wrote that the law ""provides for removing animals that constitute a demonstrable but non-immediate threat to human safety."" The latest: Calving season has ended at Priddy's ranch and the panther has gone back to the wild. A USFWS spokesperson told Pittman they're not actively looking for the panther.

Tucker Carlson Tonight airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on Fox News Channel. Watch a popular conservative radio host tell Fox News the 'media has made too much' of the Hillary Clinton 'scandal': On Special Report With Bret Baier Thursday, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt played the proverbial wet blanket for all who believe recent filings by Special Counsel John Durham will mean bad news for Hillary Clinton. Since a recent filing by Durham, most of which centers around Michael Sussman, a lawyer associated with Clinton’s campaign, many in conservative media have excitedly pointed the finger at Clinton, accusing her of things that aren’t even in Durham’s report. Fox News and other outlets have spent countless hours on the subject, but Hewitt says people are making too much of it.
“I agree that the media has made too much of this filing. I think I said two nights ago, we don’t know anything yet because Sussman can either go John Dean or he can go Gordon Liddy,” Hewitt said, referencing Watergate. He continued, “But I noted that John Durham said there will be motions in limine coming. And Harold (Ford Jr.) and I did go to Michigan Law School and we both know one thing from our time there, from great law professors, nobody knows nothing about what the prosecution has until the prosecution rolls out its indictment.”
Conservative lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, who was a staunch defender of former President Trump, appeared on Newsmax about a half hour earlier, and said very much the same. Dershowitz said he hasn’t seen anything yet that points the finger at Clinton, and that the indictments so far only add up to process crimes instead of substantive indictments.

2/23/2022,"A woman in Tennessee is accused of exchanging items for sexual encounters with nine high school boys she spoke with on social media, officials said. Melissa A. Blair, 38, of Englewood — about 60 miles northeast of Chattanooga — was indicted on Feb. 15 on 23 charges, including 18 counts of aggravated statutory rape, four counts of human trafficking by patronizing prostitution and one count of solicitation of a minor, McMinn County Sheriff Joe Guy announced.Guy said the victims, students at McMinn Central High School, were all minors when Blair had sexual encounters with them in exchange for items between the spring of 2020 and until late 2021. He declined to specify what those items were during a news conference last week. Blair could not be reached for comment by NBC News. Her attorney, Robert Kurtz, declined comment on Tuesday. McMinn County Director of Schools Lee Parkison said during the joint media briefing he was surprised the allegations against Blair — a parent who was involved in booster clubs — stayed secret for so long, especially in the age of social media. Jerry Harris, a former star in Netflix's ""Cheer,"" plead guilty in his child pornography case. Harris has been held without bond since his arrest in September 2020 for allegedly eliciting minors for sex at cheerleading competitions. Authorities began investigating Blair after district officials were alerted to her through an anonymous letter, Parkison said. “I want to thank the person who put this anonymous letter in my office,” he said. “Without them, this could still be going on.” The sheriff’s office received a referral from the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services on Dec. 9, Guy said. About a week later, detectives with the sheriff’s office went to Blair’s home and spoke with her. Authorities later executed a search warrant at her house, according to the sheriff’s office. Stephen Crump, district attorney general with the Tenth Judicial District, said during last week’s media briefing that investigators suspect there are more victims. “In a case like this, it truly is about those who were victimized,” he said. “It’s not about a headline. It’s not about a trial. It’s about trying to make, as much as possible, our victims whole.” In a statement Tuesday, Crump said: “We are extremely concerned that other victims may exist. I know that this is a difficult topic for children and parents to discuss. It is crucial that we identify any additional victims. We believe that several may exist. I am asking any victims and their parents to come forward if they haven’t.” Two of Blair’s alleged victims are now adults, Guy said. According to the indictment, the victims, who were identified by their dates of birth, were born between the years 2003 and 2006. Blair turned herself in to the sheriff’s office last week and later posted $100,000 bond, authorities said. Her arraignment is scheduled for Monday, Crump said.

To stay as fit as she is, Alexandra makes sure to get in some cardio and strength training sessions several times a week. Oh, she's also into boxing and hot yoga. Alexandra Daddario doesn’t screw around in the fitness department. But the 35-year-old former Baywatch star just shared she’s thinking of expanding her workout repertoire. Alexandra dropped two new photos of herself on Instagram working a gorgeous tennis outfit from Alo. In the pics, Alexandra layered a black pleated tennis skirt over a black high-cut bodysuit for a look that clearly shows off her tight abs and toned legs—not to mention those sculpted abs. “Now I just need to learn how to play tennis 🎾,” she joked in the caption. Naturally, her followers were all about it in the comments: “Just perfect❤️,” one wrote. “Pretty woman 💙,” another said. While Alexandra may not get her kicks on the tennis court just yet, she’s got plenty of other things going on to keep her fit. Alexandra previously told Health that she picked up some great workout tricks when she trained for her role as a lifeguard in Baywatch. Back then, Alexandra said she “was doing more aerobic activity and way more weight training, which is something I’ve [since] incorporated into my daily routine.” That said, she’s scaled back a little bit, noting that she was going at a rate that was “not sustainable” unless, ya know, it’s your job. So, while she still does both, she also likes to do a lot of hot yoga and really zeros in on getting her mindfulness fix as she works out. But Alexandra knows how to tear it up at the gym, too. She previously dropped a clip of herself doing an AMRAP workout with her trainer Patrick Murphy on YouTube—and whoa. Check it out and just try to keep your jaw from hitting the floor: In the video, Alexandra cycled through exercises like lateral raises, reverse lunges, jump squats, push-ups, and stability ball crunches, and kept on going for 20 minutes. In another YouTube video, she got her sweat on alongside her Baywatch co-star Zac Efron—and even beat him in a sit-up competition. And of course, Alexandra fuels her body well. She likes to focus on easy-to-prep meals, which is why she told Health that her go-to dish is super simple: quinoa, avocado, and chicken breast. ""When I’m hungry, I want food, like, now, or else I get very cranky,"" she said. And, while she’s a healthy eater overall, she still makes room for other foods saying that, ""I think you have to indulge or the stress of not being able to enjoy what you eat will detract from any benefits you’re getting from eating healthy,"" she said.

An aide to former President Donald Trump described a 2019 White House gathering with the then-president and Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, as the ""craziest"" meeting he'd ever attended, according to The New York Times Magazine. Ginni Thomas — an attorney and conservative activist — has been in the political trenches with right-leaning leaders for decades. Her influence is so valued among conservative activists — and Justice Thomas — that she even came to the White House for what was supposed to be a private lunch between Trump and her husband, according to the magazine. Leonard Leo, the former executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, told the magazine that Trump sought to cultivate a relationship with Justice Thomas once he realized the immense popularity of the jurist among the Republican base, creating an opening for Ginni Thomas with the then-president. The magazine also detailed newly-reported ties between Ginni Thomas and organizers of a January 6, 2021 rally in support of Trump, along with efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, in which Joe Biden oust the former president in a decisive 306-232 Electoral College victory. According to nine former Trump aides and advisors, who spoke to the magazine anonymously, the ensuing meetings with Ginni Thomas created a sense of confusion among the staffers. Several of the staffers were unsure of Ginni Thomas' role and wondered if she was speaking as an activist or as a paid consultant, while also highlighting her insistence on promoting far-right candidates for positions within the Trump administration, per the magazine. ""Here's what the peeps think,"" she stated in the meetings of the GOP base, according to an aide. ""We have to listen to the peeps."" Ginni Thomas' hard-driving style alienated several of the aides so much that they assembled an opposition report on her, with one of the staffers describing her as a ""wrecking ball."" In January 2019, Ginni Thomas met with Trump at the White House alongside select members of her conservative group, Groundswell, where a Trump aide described the nature of the conversation in unflattering terms. ""It was the craziest meeting I've ever been to,"" he told the magazine. ""She started by leading the prayer."" Later, the aide said that conservative attendees spoke disparagingly of ""the transsexual agenda"" and parents ""chopping off their children's breasts."" According to the aide, Trump ""tried to rein it in"" but ""it was hard to hear"" because members of the group were praying out loud during the conversation. Later, some key details of the White House meeting leaked, and Ginni Thomas' advocacy against transgender rights made headlines. In the past, she has used inflammatory language against transgender Americans, saying the country is under threat by the ""fascist left,"" which she said includes ""transsexual fascists."" In the meeting, Ginni Thomas and other attendees also lamented that several conservative candidates to their liking had been stymied from assuming several roles, while advocating for the Trump administration's personnel office to be swept of ""Never Trump"" Republicans.

2/23/2022,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany has taken steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Tuesday, as the West started taking punitive measures against Moscow over the Ukraine crisis. Scholz told reporters in Berlin that his government was taking the measure in response to Moscow’s actions in Ukraine. The decision is a significant move for the German government, which had long resisted pulling the plug on the project despite pressure from the United States and some European countries to do so. Washington has for years argued that building another pipeline bringing natural gas from Russia to Germany increases Europe’s reliance on Russian energy supplies. Scholz said that the government had decided to “reassess” the certification of the pipeline, which hasn’t begun operating yet, in light of the latest developments. “That will certainly take time, if I may say so,” he said. Germany meets about a quarter of its energy needs with natural gas, a share that will increase in the coming years as the country switches off its last three nuclear power plants and phases out the use of coal. About half of the natural gas used in Germany comes from Russia.",World/Associated Press,Ukraine-Russia: Germany suspends Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-russia-germany-takes-steps-110845607.html
