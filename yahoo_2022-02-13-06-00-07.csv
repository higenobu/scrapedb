2/13/2022,"For decades, Linda Slaten’s sons believed they’d never find out who raped and murdered their mother when they were children. But on Wednesday the brothers confronted her killer — a man who had a connection to the family all those years ago. Joseph Mills had once been Tim Slaten’s youth football coach, but pleaded guilty on Wednesday to sexually assaulting and killing the 31-year-old single mother as her two sons slept nearby on Sept. 4, 1981, local station WTVT reports. “I hope when you’re in prison, things happen to you. Bad things,” Tim Slaten, the younger brother, told his former coach in court. Mills had been someone Tim Slaten trusted — he'd even given the boy a ride to and from practice the day before his mother’s body was discovered. “I saw the crime scene, I saw what you did, and then you act like my friend. I rode in the car with you,” Tim, who was just 12 years old at the time of the slaying, said in court, adding that he had “so much hate” for Mills. For years, Tim said he had “no clue” Mills had been his mother’s killer, describing him to WLFA as being the “last person on his radar."" “I got a picture of our football team and him standing right behind me in the picture. Been in my house this whole time and never had a clue,” he said. Tim’s older brother, Jeff Slaten, who had been 15 years old at the time of his mother's murder, was equally enraged. ""I hate you; you can’t die and burn in hell fast enough for me,"" he said of the decades of pain and unanswered questions the family was forced to endure, WTVT reported. “Why Joe? Why’d you take my mama?” he asked Mills at his sentencing, according to WFLA. ""I don’t know why you can’t tell me why. Why you have to murder my mama?” The morning Linda Slaten's body was found, her sister Judy Butler had gone to the apartment so the two could have coffee. But when she arrived, Butler found her sister dead — laying on the bed with a wire hangr wrapped around her neck. She had been sexually assaulted and died of strangulation, according to an affidavit previously obtained by Oxygen.com.  “Joe, how could you do that?” Butler asked Mills during the hearing, according to WFLA. “Do you have any soul? Do you have any remorse?” But Mills never provided an answer to either Jeff Slaten or Judy Butler, and only briefly addressed the court.  “I am a good person. I’m not that person that they’re painting me out to be,” he told the judge before being sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  For decades, Linda Slaten’s case had been unsolved until investigators took a new look at the evidence. They submitted a DNA profile developed from evidence at the crime scene to an online ancestry database, through which they were able to link to Mills through genetic genealogy.  After the link was made with the help of Parabon Nano labs, investigators discreetly collected a fresh DNA sample from Mills’ trash and were able to match it to DNA found in Linda’ Slaten's rape kit.  Investigators were also able to link Mills’ to the murder through his fingerprints, Florida station WTSP reports.  Although Mills had initially pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, he changed the plea this week in order to avoid the death penalty.  While the sentence gives Linda Slaten’s sons some measure of peace, they said it will be difficult to ever find closure.  “It’s not over in a sense because he’s still walking,” Tim Slaten said. “My mom’s not. I saw the crime scene. It’s in my head every day.” ",U.S./Oxygen,'You Can’t Die And Burn In Hell Fast Enough’: Brothers Confront Man Who Killed Their Mom In 1981,https://news.yahoo.com/t-die-burn-hell-fast-223311931.html
2/13/2022,"Rick Ross and Shaquille O’Neal found themselves making headlines this week for an unexpected reason, after images of their unkempt feet went viral. O’Neal’s feet were broadcast on Feb. 9 during an episode of “NBA on TNT” after he walked barefoot into the studio. The clip showcased a close-up look of the 49-year-old’s dry and crusty toes while he and his co-hosts, including Dwyane Wade, Ernie Johnson and Candace Parker, discussed the upcoming NBA All-Star game. When asked why his feet were ashy given his endorsement deal with Gold Bond, a skin-care company, O’Neal simply stated, “That’s not ash; that’s dry skin.” The following day on Feb. 10, Ross uploaded a photo of his feet on his Instagram Story. In the now-deleted image, the rapper appeared to ask his followers to assist him in putting on lotion. He said, alongside a meter scale, “Lotion me?” As fans began to view O’Neal and Ross’ feet, many expressed they were flabbergasted by the state of both men’s feet, given how wealthy they are. “They got WAYYYY TOO much mf money to be walking around with flinstone feet.” “They too rich to have crusty feet.” “Y’all got too much money to have feet like that idgaf that’s nasty asf like y’all are not in the trenches no more!!!!” “All that money and they have feet that look like that??” “They have to start doing better. All the money in the world and designer whatever doesn’t mean s–t if your teeth, toes, nails, and hygiene is not up to par.” Among the previous remarks, others went as far as to compare the condition of Ross’ and O’Neal’s feet. One wrote, “Honestly, Rick just needs lotion, but Shaq needs some work done lmao.” Another said, “Well, at least Rozay got toenails. Shaq’s toenails need to be repaired. He needs a whole treatment.” Despite the commotion both Ross and O’Neal caused on social media, it is unclear what provoked the feet reveals. ‘They Could Do That But I Wouldn’t Do That’: Shaquille O’Neal Opens Up About Why He Vows to Never Embarrass His Exes, Shaunie O’Neal and Arnetta Yardbourgh, on Social Media Deion Sanders Was A Member Of NFC Pro Bowl Staff | Is This A Sign Of The Future For Coach Prime?

2/13/2022,"The price of Bitcoin has dropped by more than 18% in the past 30 days. Predictions that the world’s original crypto would top US$100,000 by the end of the year are beginning to look optimistic, to put it diplomatically. Yet Mark Yusko, chief executive and investment officer at Morgan Creek Capital, is holding firm in his belief that Bitcoin will be worth US$250,000 within the next five years. He says Bitcoin’s price, as denominated in U.S. dollars, is bunk. “It’s interesting that in the short run, when prices fall, as they have in the last few weeks, people start to get a little antsy and start to question these long-term trends and fundamentals,” Yusko told Forkast.News in a video interview. “Price is a liar.” In terms of Bitcoin’s actual value, the truth lies in gold, Yusko said, asserting that fiat currencies can conceal changes in real value. Watch Yusko’s full interview with Forkast.News Editor-in-Chief Angie Lau to learn more about the secular and cyclical dynamics of Bitcoin, the impact of Bitcoin futures ETFs on the market, how investors should distribute wealth in the crypto space, and upcoming opportunities in 2022. 00:00 Introduction 01:42 What is Bitcoin doing? 08:00 The global Bitcoin market 25:03 Bitcoin’s disruptions 34:47 Too late to buy Bitcoin? 41:32 Bitcoin risks and threats 49:50 Hidden opportunities in Asia? 56:42 Goodbye 2021, hello 2022 --- HIGHLIGHTS Bitcoin’s secular dynamics: “One Bitcoin is one Bitcoin, and it will always be one Bitcoin. But you and I don't buy Bitcoin in Bitcoin. We buy it in something else — we buy it in dollars, we buy it in yen, we buy it in euros. If we look at the price of Bitcoin in dollars, it's materially higher today than it was at the beginning of the year. It's materially higher than it was a year ago, or two years ago, or 10 years ago, or at the inception. That's not necessarily because Bitcoin got better. It did become more broadly adopted, but more importantly, the dollar continues to get worse, or the yen continues to get worse, or the euro continues to get worse. That global race to the bottom is the secular trend that's going to push prices higher, along with these halving cycles.” Bitcoin is borderless: “[Switzerland has] actual spot-based (Bitcoin) ETFs … and so that’s increasing demand for Bitcoin as money flows into that ETF. Canada has that, as well. There's one about to launch in Australia. That's positive for the ecosystem — that increases demand for physical Bitcoin, increases participation. It increases that network effect and it gives us rise to that Metcalfe's Law parabolic curve that we've all seen, where the value of the network rises proportionally to the square of the number of participants in the network. But it's such a globalized world — again, American exceptionalism: we think we drive everything in the world and Bitcoin, but we're really, like, 25% of the market — and there's still activity in all these big markets around the world, including China.” Everything will be tokenized: “What's happening here is that we're going to go through a period where these innovations around digital scarcity are going to apply to everything ... All US$700 trillion of assets in the world are going to be tokenized, digitized, and they're going to trade in this tokenized form and non-fungible tokens... ‘Oh, they’re just funky JPEGs’? No, no, no, no — everything will be an NFT. Your identity, my identity, my marriage license, my driver's license — everything that I own, every piece of title, every piece of art — it'll all be an NFT.” Don’t follow the money: “There's the stock-to-flow model that everybody talks about that (pseudonymous analyst) Plan B created, and now everybody is all upset because he said it would be US$100,000 by the end of November, and it's not. That means the model is broken. I say, ‘No, that just means price is a liar.’ The model is still accurate. It just means now the price is undervalued relative to the value. That [model] is about 95%, 96% correlated. The most highly correlated is actually the value of Bitcoin related to gold. How many ounces of gold does it take to buy a Bitcoin? That's 99% correlated.” --- #Crypto #Blockchain #BlockchainTechnology #DigitalAssets #Cryptocurrency #DeFi #Bitcoin #Gold #Currency #ETF #Innovation #Digitization #Tokenization #NFT #Stocks --- MORE WORD ON THE BLOCK INTERVIEWS: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLENVHIZFjdMT-q2_LSNncbuoS_LGiuLz2",Business/Forkast News Videos,"Bitcoin’s Price is a Lie, Says Morgan Creek Capital Chief",https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-price-lie-says-morgan-095329603.html
2/13/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Valentyn Ogirenko KYIV (Reuters) - Several thousand Ukrainians rallied in Kyiv on Saturday to show unity amid fears of a Russian invasion, as Ukraine's leader told people not to panic and pushed back against what he said was a glut of bleak war predictions being reported in the media. Tension has mounted as Russia has built up more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine and carried out large-scale exercises. The United States said on Friday an invasion could start at any moment. Russia denies planning to invade. Ukrainians filed through the centre of Kyiv in a column, chanting ""Glory to Ukraine"" and carrying Ukrainian flags and banners that said ""Ukrainians will resist"" and ""Invaders must die"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who attended police drills in southern Kherson region, said a Russian attack could happen at any time, but pushed back against what he called excessive amounts of information about a major looming war. ""The best friend of our enemies is panic in our country. And all this information is just provoking panic and can't help us,"" he said. ""I can't agree or disagree with what hasn't happened yet. So far, there is no full-scale war in Ukraine."" The United States and numerous Western governments have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, and Washington on Saturday said it was ordering most of its Kyiv embassy staff to leave. ""We have to be ready each day. It did not begin yesterday. It began in 2014, so, we are ready and this is why we are here,"" Zelenskiy said in a reference to Russia's annexation of Crimea and backing for an anti-Kyiv separatist insurgency in the east. In a separate statement, the head of Ukrainian armed forces Valery Zaluzhny and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said the aggressor won't take Kyiv, Odessa, Kharkiv, or any other Ukraine's city. ""We have strengthened the defense of Kyiv. We have gone through the war and due preparation. Therefore, we are ready to meet enemies and not with flowers, but with Stingers, Javelins and NLAW. Welcome to hell!"", Zaluzhny said, referring to an array of anti-rocket and anti-aircraft weapons received from the West. The military says Ukrainian intelligence and the army have control of the situation on the borders and Kyiv is coordinating its actions with allies. ""Such a union of leading democracies has not existed for decades,"" Zaluzhny and Reznikov said. Zelenskiy voiced frustrations just last month with dire assessments of a war. Such warnings have taken their toll on the economic, piling pressure on the national currency. U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will speak later on Saturday.
