3/24/2022,"The world’s forests play a far greater and more complex role in tackling climate crisis than previously thought, due to their physical effects on global and local temperatures, according to new research. The role of forests as carbon sponges is well established. But comprehensive new data suggests that forests deliver climate benefits well beyond just storing carbon, helping to keep air near and far cool and moist due to the way they physically transform energy and water. The study, which is the first to pinpoint the non-carbon dioxide benefits of different forests, found that the band of tropical rainforests spanning Latin America, central Africa and south-east Asia generate the most local and global benefits. Researchers from the US and Colombia found that overall forests keep the planet at least half of a degree Celsius cooler when biophysical effects – from chemical compounds to turbulence and the reflection of light – are combined with carbon dioxide. In the tropics – from Brazil and Guatemala to Chad, Cameroon and Indonesia – the cooling effect is more than one degree. In short, while all forests provide multiple benefits, some are more important than others in keeping the climate stable. “Despite the mounting evidence that forests deliver myriad climate benefits, trees are still viewed just as sticks of carbon by many policymakers in the climate change arena,” said Louis Verchot, principal scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and co-author of the study The Unseen Effects of Deforestation: Biophysical Effects on Climate. “Forests are key to mitigation, but also adaptation.” Deforestation has devastating impacts on biodiversity, food security, and global heating. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned about catastrophic consequences humanity faces with rising temperatures. The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, suggest that forests are important to mitigation and adaptation, cooling the air and protecting us from droughts, extreme heat and floods caused by the climate breakdown. Forest cooling is due to a range of biophysical effects such as the physical aspect of the trees’ wood, leaves and density, as opposed to biochemical factors such as the carbon. Researchers found that forests emit chemicals called biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) which create aerosols that reflect incoming energy and form clouds – both are cooling effects. While they also lead to a build-up of two greenhouse gases – ozone and methane – on balance, the cooling outweighs the warming. Deep roots, efficient water use and so-called canopy roughness also enable forests to mitigate the impact of extreme heat. These physical qualities allow trees to move heat and moisture away from the Earth’s surface where we live, which directly cools the local area and influences cloud formation and rainfall – which has ramifications far away. In the tropics, where forest carbon storage and sequestration rates are highest, the biophysical effects of forests amplify the carbon benefits. In other words, tropical deforestation immediately increases extreme heat locally and decreases regional and local rainfall. “The biophysical factors don’t cool the planet, but they do change the way we experience heat, and that matters,” said Deborah Lawrence, professor at the University of Virginia and the lead author. “The heart of the tropics is at the heart of the planet and these forests are critical for our survival.” Better protection, expansion and improved management of the world’s forests are considered by many experts as among the most promising nature-based solutions. Michael Coe, the tropics program director at the Woodwell Climate Research Center and a study co-author, said: “Without the forest cover we have now, the planet would be hotter and the weather more extreme. Forests provide us defense against the worst-case global warming scenarios.”",News/Environment,"The world’s forests do more than just store carbon, new research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/forests-climate-crisis-carbon-cooling-effect
3/24/2022,"The cockpit voice recorder from a plane which crashed into a Chinese mountainside with 132 people onboard is being analysed in Beijing, as the recovery mission confirms it has found human remains at the site. The China Eastern Airlines flight crashed on Monday afternoon, after plunging from more than 6,000m (20,000ft). The cause of the crash is not known, and investigators have said determining it could prove difficult given the circumstances. The plane crashed with such force that much of it disintegrated on impact, and the recovered black box was “badly damaged”. A second black box, which records flight data, has not yet been found. Zhu Tao, an official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), said the storage units of the recovered recorder were damaged but “relatively complete” and had been sent to a Beijing institute for decoding. More than 300 rescue workers remain at the crash site in a remote area near Wuzhou in Teng County, Guangxi province. Work was suspended briefly on Wednesday due to poor weather, but an evening briefing revealed some human remains had been located. Some details of passengers have begun to emerge in Chinese state media. In China Youth Daily, a man who gave the pseudonym Wang Baiyang said his 26-year-old sister, her husband and their 18-month old daughter were onboard and that it had been their first ever flight. They were flying to Guangazhou for medical treatment for the child, and had originally been scheduled on an earlier flight but it was cancelled. “For the past two days, I felt like I had a dream, and I always felt that when I woke up the next day, my sister would call me,” he said. “I didn’t think it was real at all, first my grandfather died, and then I heard the news of the flight, and I just froze there and tried to reach my sister through the phone.” Wang said his sister, Gu Hanyu, sent the family a video before the flight of her daughter jumping around the lounge and playing with her mask, and giggling. Gu was born deaf, he said, and had met her husband Guo Zengqiang on a blind date. They married in February 2020 at a simple ceremony. “Who would have thought that just after they found a doctor who can cure the child’s disease, this disease will not have to be treated,” said Wang. “Life-saving flights become fatal flights. It was their first and last flight.” A retiree surnamed Zhang, from Shenzhen, visited the crash site earlier and told Reuters his nephew was onboard. “I hope the country can thoroughly investigate this matter and find out whether it was the manufacturer’s fault or it was a maintenance problem,” Zhang said, his eyes filling with tears. The search for the second flight recorder continues, with investigators hoping the information could give answers to why the plane, which had passed safety checks prior to taking off, crashed during the cruising phase of the flight. The plane was a six-year-old Boeing 737-89P, according to flight data trackers. The Boeing 737-800s are among the most common passenger planes in the world, and different to the 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. In apparent answer to speculation the crash could be due to pilot activity, Sun Shiying, chairman of the airline’s Yunnan branch, told reporters on Wednesday the three pilots on board were in good health and “had good performance and had maintained harmonious relationships with their families”. The investigation into the worst air disaster in China for over a decade is being led by local authorities, however American investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have been invited to take part because the plane was made in the US. However it has not yet confirmed if those investigators can travel to China because of visa and quarantine requirements. “We are working with the Department of State to address those issues with the Chinese government before any travel will be determined,” the NTSB said.

3/24/2022,"Alex Hawke’s decision to deport a former US marine has been overturned because he was directed to “sign here” by stickers on his brief without sufficient personal consideration of the case. Joseph Leon McQueen successfully challenged the immigration minister’s refusal to revoke his visa cancellation in a federal court judgment handed down on Wednesday. McQueen, a father of seven and grandfather of three who had spent 22 years in Australia, used a bizarre photo of Hawke’s signed decision to argue it had been rushed. The photo included in the court book by the minister depicted his signed decision of 14 April in a binder containing two “sign here” stickers, which Justice Craig Colvin found was sitting on an unidentified person’s lap and also showed the steering wheel of a car. The judge noted that Hawke provided “no explanation” for the circumstances in which the photo was taken and why his decision was produced to the court in that way. The judge made no finding the decision was made in the front seat of a car, but inferred “a degree of urgency” in its making. McQueen is a US citizen granted permanent residency in Australia in 1995 before he worked as a civilian contractor installing electronics for the Australian and US militaries in fly-in fly-out stints in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. McQueen’s visa was automatically cancelled in late 2019 when he was sentenced to 21 months in prison for selling methamphetamine, offending he attributes in part to post-traumatic stress disorder and financial hardship from a back injury. McQueen’s lawyers argued Hawke “failed to give proper, genuine, and realistic consideration to the merits” of the decision about whether to restore his visa, accusing him of engaging in a process of “industrial-scale personal decision-making” on visa cancellations. Hawke told the court he received the brief on McQueen’s case on 13 April at 10am in Canberra and signed it around 4:20pm the next day at his house in north-west Sydney, a window of 30 hours and 20 minutes to consider it. Justice Colvin found it would only have taken “less than an hour” to give personal consideration to the 230 pages of material included in the brief which was “not technical” and “not voluminous”. Justice Colvin noted the department gave Hawke a 12-page submission that attached all of McQueen’s representations in the case, but “at no point” did it indicate he was required to consider all of the material. On the contrary, the brief indicated that personal consideration was “not required” for reasons including that: Five recommendations could be adopted by circling responses; There were two “sign here” stickers attached to the decision page and the draft set of reasons and; The presence of a summary indicating it was “appropriate” to rely on that rather than the primary material. “Having regard to the way in which the minister was briefed and the absence of any evidence from the minister or any member of his department … I find that the minister followed the instruction he was given.” Justice Colvin said his view that Hawke had acted on the summary information was reinforced by the “limited time” available to him to make a decision and the “urgency with which he was asked to approach, and did approach, the task”. Justice Colvin found it was “entirely appropriate” for the department to brief the minister, but the “deliberative task” had to be personally performed by the minister. That was of “particular significance” because in visa cancellations a delegate’s decision can be reviewed on its merits but the minister’s “personal exercise of the power” cannot, he said. Justice Colvin ordered the decision not to revoke the visa cancellation be set aside and the matter be sent back to the minister to determine “according to law”, with Hawke to pay McQueen’s costs. McQueen’s lawyer, Ziya Zarifi, said his client, “his partner and Australian citizen children are all relieved by the judgment”. “They all hope that he will be given another chance to remain in Australia so he can once again make a practical, financial and emotional contribution to their lives,” Zarifi told Guardian Australia. Zarifi argued the American government would want “genuine and realistic consideration” of his case, given his work “alongside Australians and US military personnel to fight for democracy [and] freedom”. “It would therefore be in the national interest for Mr McQueen, who is a reformed and rehabilitated person, to be allowed to remain with his family in Australia.” Guardian Australia contacted Hawke for comment.",News/Australia news,"Australian judge overturns deportation of former US marine, citing Alex Hawke’s lack of personal consideration",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/australian-judge-overturns-deportation-of-former-us-marine-citing-alex-hawkes-lack-of-personal-consideration
