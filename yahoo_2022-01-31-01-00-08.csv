1/31/2022,"When Axios broke the news Wednesday night that MSNBC was extending ""Morning Joe"" by an hour and replacing Brian Williams at the 11pm ET hour with Stephanie Ruhle, even top producers were caught off guard. Network executives weren't planning to announce lineup changes for another few weeks in February. Negotiations were ongoing. Why it matters: The leak sent leaders at MSNBC scrambling to address questions internally about what a fourth hour of ""Morning Joe"" would look like, including which producers would be responsible for the additional programming, and how a 9 a.m. hour would cater to a West Coast audience.

Subscribe for free Given that MSNBC President Rashida Jones and NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde first approached the ""Morning Joe"" hosts with the plan around two weeks ago, many of the details weren't fully baked, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Details: With ""Morning Joe"" marking its 15th year in September, and with ratings continuing to beat CNN in the mornings, Jones, Conde and other executives thought an extension of the show made sense. But they only began to consider it seriously a few weeks ago, once it was decided that Ruhle would move to the 11 p.m. hour, leaving her 9 a.m. slot open. Hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who are married and deeply involved in the show's day-to-day operations, were excited about the idea, but had questions about what the extension would mean for their staff, according to a source familiar with their thinking. In addition to producing ""Morning Joe"" from 6 to 9 a.m. ET, the same team also produces ""Way Too Early"" at 5 a.m. ET. An additional hour at 9 a.m. ET would open up an opportunity for ""Morning Joe"" to address West Coast audiences. But that also meant the show's team would need to figure out new coverage plans. Ruhle, a senior business correspondent for NBC News and a former bank executive, anchored the show when markets opened, and often brought on guests based on the West Coast to talk about tech and business news. Catch up quick: Even before William's departure last winter, senior executives began mulling significant lineup changes in 2022, according to two sources familiar with their thinking. A top priority would be leaning further into familiar franchises and figuring out how top talent could be utilized to boost streaming efforts. In August 2020, the network announced it would be expanding Nicolle Wallace’s show, ""Deadline: White House,"" to two hours and would move Chuck Todd's weekday show, ""MTP Daily"" (for ""Meet the Press"") earlier in the afternoon. Later, the network's highest-rated star, Rachel Maddow, reached a multiyear deal with NBCUniversal to run a production company that would broaden her portfolio of projects with the network, but would remove her from her day-to-day hosting duties at the 9 p.m. ET primetime hour later in 2022. Be smart: Several staffers Axios spoke with said leaders were caught off guard when the story broke. Just hours before Axios' story published, NBC News leaders hosted a call with staff about network updates. The topic of who would replace Maddow and Williams was one of the first questions they were forced to answer. Jones said she would tell employees more about the 11 p.m. ET hour when there was something to share. She didn’t provide an update on who would replace Maddow, but noted that Maddow’s not going far. Another source said Jones was unable to get on the phone with staffers of ""The 11th Hour,"" Williams' former turf, before the news came out. Asked for comment, Jones said: ""We are very excited for our viewers to be rolling out the new lineup for 'Morning Joe' and Stephanie, and how their voices fit in our broader vision for programming during this consequential year.” What's next: Ruhle is expected to begin anchoring ""The 11th Hour"" in a few weeks, according to a network source familiar with MSNBC's plans. Staffing plans and production logistics for the 9 a.m. hour are still being worked out.

1/31/2022,"Forecasting models and warning systems, designed primarily to assess earthquake-triggered waves, did not account for the boosting effects of the shockwave. It was a critical flaw in these systems, scientists said, leaving them unable to predict exactly when the waves would hit land. Satellite images from the University of Massachusetts Lowell showed the scale of the massive shockwave from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption, which triggered a tsunami that destroyed villages and resorts and knocked out communications for the South Pacific nation of about 105,000 people.

1/31/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will ask NATO to clarify whether it intends to implement key security commitments, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Sunday, after Moscow said the alliance's response to its demands did not go far enough. Russia has forced the U.S.-led defence alliance and the 57-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to negotiate over regional security by massing around 100,000 troops near Ukraine while denying it plans to invade. Russian President Putin said on Friday the United States and NATO had not addressed Moscow's main security demands in their standoff over Ukraine but that it was ready to keep talking. ""Today, through the Foreign Ministry, we are sending an official request to our colleagues in the Alliance and the OSCE, urging them to explain how they intend to implement (their) commitment not to strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others,"" Lavrov said on state television. ""If they do not intend to do so, then they should explain why. This will be a key question in determining our future proposals, which we will report to the Russian President Vladimir Putin,"" Lavrov said. Russia will seek from the West not just promises, but legally binding security guarantees, ""that would ensure security on the entire European continent, with full, equal regard to Russia's legitimate interests"", Lavrov said. Russia has demanded NATO pull back troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar its neighbour Ukraine, a former Soviet state, from ever joining. Washington and its NATO allies reject that position but say they are ready to discuss other topics such as arms control and confidence-building measures.

1/31/2022,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen thanked democratic nations for their support of the island in her Lunar New Year message on Sunday and pledged to ""stride out"" into the world, sounding a defiant note in the face of unrelenting Chinese pressure. China, which claims the democratically-ruled island as its own territory, has increased military activity around Taiwan over the past two years and stepped up efforts to limit its international role, lambasting those who have sought to support Taipei or strengthen ties with it. In a short pre-recorded video message a day before the eve of Lunar New Year on Monday, the formal start of the most important holiday in the Chinese-speaking world, Tsai expressed appreciation for growing international support for Taiwan. ""I want to especially thank all democratic partners for their support to Taiwan over the past year,"" she said. ""We will continue to deepen exchanges with all countries and stride out into the world."" Taiwan has been heartened by support not only from the United States, traditionally its most important backer, but also leaders and politicians in Japan, Europe and by the G7 group of industrialised nations, all of which have angered Beijing. Tsai neither directly mentioned China nor directly offered it new year greetings, simply extending best wishes to ""good friends"" around the world celebrating the festival, which is also observed in countries such as Vietnam and South Korea. Last year Tsai wished China a happy Lunar New Year, but said she would not yield to Chinese pressure and reiterated a call for dialogue to resume with Beijing, which China rejected.
