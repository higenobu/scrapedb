3/29/2022,"STORY: Canada's indigenous leaders say they've waited for this moment for years - even decades. This is their first ever Vatican meeting with the Catholic pope. Representatives from the Métis and Inuit nations met with Pope Francis on Monday. They asked for unfettered access to Church records on residential schools and institutions - where more than 150,000 indigenous children were sent to be stripped of their culture and heritage. Many were subjected to abuse, rape and malnutrition. The President of the Métis National Council, Cassidy Caron, said Francis was attentive during the meeting but no apology for the church’s role in the schools took place. ""He listened and he nodded along when our survivors told their stories. You know, our survivors did an incredible job in that meeting of standing up and telling their truths.'' Some residential school survivors like Martha Greig say an apology is needed. “A genuine heartfelt apology would be a first step to start wanting to start healing… But more so for my, my fellow former students and a lot of them have now passed away but it’s also their children that are affected as well. So it would mean more so important to them, to move on.” Residential schools came to the public’s attention again last year with the discovery of the remains of 215 children at a former site. Hundreds more unmarked burial sites have been found since. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 called the practice of sending children to the institutions ""cultural genocide."" The last residential school closed in 1996. CARON: ""Untold numbers have left us without having their truths heard and their pain acknowledged. Without ever receiving the very basic humanity and healing they so rightfully deserved. That is nothing short of a travesty, both of justice and of conscience. And while the time for acknowledgement and apology and atonement is long overdue it is never too late to do the right thing."" Caron said she was not disappointed with the lack of an apology on Monday - because the indigenous want him to do so in Canada. Vatican sources say the pope will be likely making a trip this summer.",World/Reuters Videos,No papal apology at historic Vatican meeting,https://news.yahoo.com/no-papal-apology-historic-vatican-211126743.html
3/29/2022,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — A Nebraska state lawmaker apologized on Monday after he publicly cited a persistent but debunked rumor alleging that schools are placing litter boxes in school bathrooms to accommodate children who self-identify as cats. Sen. Bruce Bostelman, a conservative Republican, repeated the false claim during a public, televised debate on a bill intended to help school children who have behavioral problems. His comments quickly went viral, with one Twitter video garnering more than 300,000 views as of Monday afternoon, and drew an onslaught of online criticism and ridicule. Bostelman initially said he was “shocked” when he heard stories that children were dressing as cats and dogs while at school, with claims that schools were accommodating them with litter boxes. “They meow and they bark and they interact with their teachers in this fashion,” Bostelman said during legislative debate. “And now schools are wanting to put litter boxes in the schools for these children to use. How is this sanitary?” The rumor has persisted in a private Facebook group, “Protect Nebraska Children,” and also surfaced last month in an Iowa school district, forcing the superintendent to write to parents that it was “simply and emphatically not true."" Bostelman had said that he planned to discuss the issue with the CEO of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. He also alleged that schools were not allowing kids to wear flags, but didn't give specific examples. In 2016, Lincoln's public school district briefly asked students not to fly American flags from their vehicles after one flag was pulled from its holder, but school officials later apologized. The false claim that children who identify as cats are using litter boxes in school bathrooms has spread across the internet since at least December, when a member of the public brought it up at a school board meeting for Midland Public Schools northwest of Detroit. The claim was debunked by the district’s superintendent, who issued a statement that said there had “never been litter boxes within MPS schools.” Still, the baseless rumor has spread across the country, and become fuel for political candidates, amid the culture wars and legislative action involving gender identification in schools. Hours after his remarks, Bostelman backtracked and acknowledged that the story wasn't true. He said he checked into the claims with state Sen. Lynne Walz, a Democrat who leads the Legislature's Education Committee, and confirmed there were no such incidents. “It was just something I felt that if this really was happening, we needed to address it and address it quickly,” Bostelman said. The furor over public school restrooms comes as a growing number of conservative states seek laws to ban transgender students from using bathrooms that match their gender identity. ___ Associated Press reporter Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow Grant Schulte on Twitter: https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte",U.S./Associated Press,Nebraska lawmaker apologizes for debunked litter box claim,https://news.yahoo.com/nebraska-lawmaker-apologizes-citing-false-224855969.html
