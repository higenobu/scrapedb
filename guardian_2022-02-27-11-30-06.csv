2/27/2022,"Ukrainian soldiers believed to have died while defending an island after telling a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself”, may still be alive, according to Ukraine’s State Border Guard. Initial reports said the 13 border guards had died after refusing to surrender Snake Island, which sits 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, from a Russian air and sea bombardment on Thursday. In his address after the first day of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced he would posthumously award all the soldiers the Hero of Ukraine award. “All border guards died heroically but did not give up,” Zelenskiy said. They had reportedly responded to an officer on board the Russian warship with a defiant: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself” when asked to lay down their weapons. But in a recent statement posted on Facebook, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said: We [have a] strong belief that all Ukrainian defenders of Zmiinyi (Snake) Island may be alive. “After receiving information about their possible location, the [border guard service] together with the Armed Forces of Ukraine are conducting work on identifying our soldiers.” It said preliminary information that border guards may be dead came before the men had lost contact. “We sincerely hope that the boys will return home as soon as possible,” it said, adding that it hoped that reports of the soldiers’ death proved incorrect. “Glory to Ukrainian defenders!” it added. Amid widespread admiration for the men’s bravery, the Republican senator for Nebraska, Ben Sasse, changed his Twitter bio to “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” The Russian navy is reported to have bombarded the island with deck guns before sending soldiers to take control, according to the Maritime Executive, citing local media reports. Snake Island – known as Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian – is situated near the Ukrainian and Romanian coasts along the Black Sea, and has previously been the subject of a territorial dispute between the two countries. A marine research station is situated on the island, and its maritime borders take in an area understood to be strategically important for resources including petroleum.",News/World news,Ukraine island defenders who told Russian officer ‘go fuck yourself’ may still be alive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/ukraine-island-defenders-who-told-russian-officer-go-fuck-yourself-may-still-be-alive
2/27/2022,"More than 1,400 Brisbane households are thought to have been flooded as Queensland authorities warn of the continuing threat posed by a “rain bomb” over the state’s south-east. The Brisbane River peaked in the city at 3.1 metres on Sunday morning – below the 4.46m recorded during the 2011 floods. But the city’s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, warned this was a very different weather event. “This is a unique event, there is no doubt about that,” Schrinner told reporters. “In 2011 we saw the rain had stopped while the river continued to rise. Right now, we’re seeing rain bucketing down. We have a rain bomb above south-east Queensland and it continues to come down.” Six people have died in Queensland over the past few days with a search continuing for a seventh person missing in Brisbane. The deluge was continuing on Sunday with a severe thunderstorm warning issued for the northern regions of Brisbane, and major flood warnings in place for numerous rivers including the Upper Brisbane, Stanley, Mary, Logan, Bremer and Mooloolah rivers. The town of Gympie recorded its highest flood level in more than a century, with more than 500 households and 130 businesses affected. Meanwhile, more than 1.4 metres of rain was recorded at Mount Glorious, north-west of Brisbane, in the 72 hours to Sunday morning. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Sunday that 1,430 homes in Brisbane were estimated to have been impacted “above the floorboards” by flooding. There were 1,040 people across the south-east in evacuation centres, 550 of those in Gympie, while Wivenhoe Dam was releasing water to ensure it retained sufficient flood capacity. The premier revealed Wivenhoe Dam had gone from a level of 59% of drinking water capacity on Thursday to 160% on Sunday morning, prompting the releases. In 2011, releases from Wivenhoe contributed to flooding in Brisbane and Ipswich, however, authorities stressed that the dam had 2m megalitres of flood capacity in excess of the approximately 1.1m megalitres of drinking water supply. The Brisbane River’s Sunday morning peak was 40cm higher than forecast, with the premier asked whether warnings had been sufficient. “We expected the system to be moving [but] it hasn’t moved. We don’t control nature,” she said. The number one message from authorities was to remain indoors and resist the urge to drive through flood waters or attempt to inspect the damage. “I know there is a lot of curiosity out there about what is going on,” Schrinner said. “That is natural but please, curiosity is a killer in these circumstances. Now is not the time for going out and about to see what’s going on and, sorry, now is not the time for cleaning up yet either. Now is the time to stay safe, to stay at home, to seek shelter and not to be out and about on the roads.” Residents were also urged to stay abreast of updated warnings. “What some people are seeing as conflicting information is a rapidly changing situation,” Schrinner said. “Information that’s one hour old is out of date. Things change on an hourly basis.” Emergency services have received more than 6,000 requests for assistance in Queensland, and there were 21,000 customers without power, primarily in the Gympie, Brisbane and Moreton areas at lunchtime on Sunday. Bureau meteorologist Laura Boekel said the situation in Brisbane remained difficult to accurately forecast. “We have this very widespread area of rain but within that we are seeing very intense pockets and exactly where those intense pockets fall is something that we cannot predict and it’s something that will lead to that river rise,” she said. With the weather system tracking south, the focus was now on Brisbane, the Gold Coast and into northern New South Wales. “Relief will come in the early hours of Monday morning but we can expect to see this rainfall event to continue today and well into tonight as well,” Boekel said. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said at 12pm on Sunday there were 11 flood warnings in place across the north of the state, with an evacuation order for the town of Tumbulgum and an evacuation warning in the Clarence River near Maclean. In addition, major flood warnings were in place for Lismore, Grafton, Coutts Crossing, Kyogle and Coraki. “We know that whilst there might be blue skies in certain parts of NSW, that that does not mean that there will not be significant flooding events that occur over the course of this week so please, please, do not be complacent,” Perrottet said.",News/Australia news,Brisbane homes flooded as ‘rain bomb’ continues to threaten lives in south-east Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/27/brisbane-homes-flooded-as-rain-bomb-continues-to-threaten-lives-in-south-east-queensland
2/27/2022,"It has taken a week to reach this point, but western governments have put down their peashooters and wheeled out the financial howitzers against Vladimir Putin. Far-reaching new sanctions against Russia were announced on Saturday night in a joint statement from the EU, UK, US and Canada. Having promised to “hit Russia very hard” with a barrage of sanctions, the UK’s first attempt at economic retaliation, presented to parliament by Boris Johnson on Tuesday, was dismissed as the equivalent of taking a “peashooter to a gunfight”. Successive UK measures, announced on Thursday and Friday, were a little more meaningful, but a long way from inflicting serious damage. The steps taken by the US and the EU also lacked bite, falling well short of the kind of restrictions currently imposed on North Korea or Iran. The UK has pushed for more, joining Ukraine’s leaders in calls to expel Russia from Swift, the main global payments system used by banks to make cross-border money transfers. Progress at an EU level was hampered by the concerns of Germany and Italy, both of which are heavily dependent on imports of Russian gas to keep homes and factories supplied with energy. Hungary and France were also resistant. But as the existential threat of the capture of a European capital by Russian forces began to percolate, national leaders shifted their positions, one by one. On Saturday, after a call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Italian prime minister vowed to fully support the EU line on sanctions, including Swift. Not long after, the first truly meaningful joint action was announced. Selected Russian banks will be expelled from Swift, a first step in disconnecting Russia from the international financial system. According to a German spokesperson, the banks affected will be all those already sanctioned by the international community, as well as other institutions if necessary. Restrictions are promised on the ability of the Russian central bank to spend its foreign currency reserves. This is an important step. Putin has overseen the hoarding of $500bn in reserves, among the largest war chests held by any central bank in the world. The EU will follow the UK in ending the sale of golden visas – a fast-track route to citizenship offered in exchange for cash. Cyprus, Malta, Portugal and the UK have sold residency to tens of thousands of Russians and other foreign nationals, with minimal checks on whether their wealth was obtained legitimately. The practice has been condemned by politicians across Europe as a national security risk, and its abolition will be welcomed by those who worry about creeping corruption. A transatlantic taskforce will finally see the world’s biggest democracies working together, across borders, to jointly freeze the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies. In another welcome move, the families and “enablers” of those on sanctions lists will also be targeted. Relatives and associates are often used to hold assets their real owners would prefer to keep hidden, and sanctions cannot be effective if they are excluded. The joint statement promises action against what leading Kremlin critic Bill Browder described as the City of London’s “pin-striped enablers” – the legion of lawyers, lobbyists, accountants and money managers who have grown fat on commissions earned from helping move corruptly acquired fortunes out of Russia and into the western financial system. As yet there is no agreement on ending imports of Russian gas and oil. A Biden official has suggested payments for these exports could continue to pass through Swift, although the new measures, if enacted, could prompt Putin to switch off the supply.
