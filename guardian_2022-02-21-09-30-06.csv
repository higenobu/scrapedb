2/21/2022,"Anti-vaxxers will be banned from “harmful and disruptive” protests outside schools and vaccination clinics after Priti Patel accepted an amendment to a bill due to be debated in parliament this week. An opposition motion to grant councils the power to take tougher action to dispel anti-vaxx campaigners was passed by peers in the House of Lords last month. On Monday, the home secretary signalled that she would not seek to strike out the amendment when the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill returns to the Commons this week.  The bill is undergoing “ping-pong”, whereby changes to the proposed legislation are debated by each house until MPs and peers come to an agreement. Patel will also table her own amendment, requiring a report on the nature and prevalence of “spiking” to be produced by the government. The practice has been a particular concern of ministers in light of warnings that drink and drug spiking have reached “epidemic” levels in the UK. Recent evidence submitted to the home affairs select committee showed that up to 15% of women and 7% of men had been spiked with alcohol or drugs. An amendment by Lord Coaker, a Labour peer, requires a similar report and has already been passed, but Patel will not accept it because she says it is too narrow, in that it only covers incidents related to sexual assault. It is understood that the home secretary believes spiking can facilitate other crimes, so the new amendment – expected to be published on Monday – will open up the review behind the report to encompass other concerns about spiking. Patel urged MPs to back the bill in votes later this week. She said it was “vitally important” to help “overhaul the criminal justice system and make our streets safer”, adding: “It must be passed soon so that we can continue to cut crime, reduce violence and protect women and girls.” But Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said crime was rising, prosecutions were falling and despite numerous government U-turns still major steps were still needed “to keep communities safe”. She accused Patel of refusing to make violence against women and girls a strategic policing requirement – giving it the same prominence as tackling organised crime – and of opposing establishing specialist rape units in every police force area and minimum sentences for rape and stalking. Cooper added: “Too often under the Tories, criminals are getting away with it and victims are being let down.”",News/Politics,Priti Patel approves ban on ‘harmful’ anti-vaxxer protests at schools,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/21/priti-patel-approves-ban-on-harmful-anti-vaxxer-protests-at-schools
2/21/2022,"Andrew Neil is to to host a new Sunday night political show on Channel 4, his first major return to broadcasting after an acrimonious departure from GB News, where he was the rightwing network’s lead presenter. It marks something of a leftwards lurch by Neil – a former BBC broadcaster known for his conservative views – to a channel whose news programme he once described as the “broadcasting arm of the Guardian”.  The live 10-part series will air in May and has a working title of Sunday Politics with Andrew Neil, according to Channel 4, which said it would feature “set-piece interviews with the highest profile politicians and newsmakers”. Neil – who spoke in September about coming close to having a breakdown while at GB News and believes “it would’ve killed me to carry on” due to the technical problems at the channel – said he was “honoured and delighted” to take on the new role. He added: “Sunday night is a pivotal point in the political week – we can sweep up what’s happened in the previous week, mop up what’s been in the Sunday papers and talkshows and throw forward to the upcoming week. We’ll aim to do all of that and more.” The half-hour weekly Sunday evening programme, whose time slot is still to be announced, will be produced by ITN Productions and Channel 4 News and will also be accompanied by a weekly podcast. Neil, who is chairman and editor-in-chief of Press Holdings Media Group, the publisher of the Spectator and other titles, stepped down as the chairman and host of a primetime show on GB News last year after differences of opinion over the direction of the channel. The former BBC host and one-time Sunday Times editor had been the face of GB News before it went on air in June last year but left after presenting only eight programmes in three months. He was unhappy with technical mistakes, the loss of top staff and its political direction. Louisa Compton, Channel 4’s head of news, current affairs and specialist factual and sport, said: “Andrew’s new show will deliver big-name politicians answering the questions the public want to hear.” Ian Rumsey, the managing director of television at ITN productions, said: “If ever there was a time when Britain needed forensic questioning, brilliant political insight and to hold those in power to account, it’s now. And there’s no finer broadcaster to do that.” Neil has previously tweeted about Channel 4 News: “Not helped by holly oaks [sic] inheritance. I like it. Broadcasting arm of the Guardian. But I like its serious agenda. Plus foreign news. And I know enough to discount its biases. As do most of its educated viewers. I watch it a lot.”",News/Media,Andrew Neil to host Sunday night political show on Channel 4,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/21/andrew-neil-to-host-sunday-night-political-show-on-channel-4
2/21/2022,"Asking prices for homes coming on to the market in Britain rose by a record 2.3% in February, according to the property website Rightmove. The listing site said it was the biggest monthly increase in the 20 years it has kept records and meant the average advertised cost of a home was up by £7,785, to £348,804. Over the past 12 months, asking prices have gone up by 9.5%.  While the number of new property listings increased by 11% during the month, the number of people looking to buy a property rose by 16%, the website said. “This new record means that average asking prices have now risen by nearly £40,000 in the two years since the pandemic started, compared to just over £9,000 in the previous two years,” a spokesperson said. The figures show a widening gap between the number of buyers and sellers that property experts say will maintain house price inflation this year well above annual salary increases. First-time buyers are expected to lose out in the race to buy the few properties on the market. Wealthier buyers, many of whom have saved large deposits during the pandemic, are among those caught by the “fear of missing out”, which Rightmove said would continue to drive prices higher over the coming months. Tim Bannister, the firm’s director of property data, said as Covid restrictions were lifted “we now have a group of movers who are looking to return closer to major cities, or at least within comfortable commuting distance of their workplaces”. Many estate agents have reported struggling to secure asking prices during the pandemic, but the shortage of homes for sale could lead to bidding wars and the return of gazumping in hotspot areas. London property prices, which had stagnated after the Brexit vote in 2016, recorded the biggest annual jump in inquiries to estate agents of any region – up 24% year on year. The capital also had its highest annual rate of price growth in the last five years as the end of pandemic restrictions and a return to the office made London and its suburbs an attractive option again. Earlier this month, Nationwide said sale prices in January were up by 11% on the same month in the previous year, giving house price inflation in 2022 the strongest start since 2005. The building society said property transactions in 2021 were at their highest level since 2007 and about 25% higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck. However, the low level of stock being released for sale meant the gap between the number of homes on the market and rising demand had continued to grow. A separate report by the agents Knight Frank found that the fastest growth in property values was in the home counties and on the outskirts of London where houses with outside space and good schools nearby were increasingly desirable. Tom Bill, the firm’s head of UK residential research said it was more reliable to use price per square foot as a measure of value, and while this put parts of central London at the top of the pile, many fashionable areas outside the capital were catching up. He said all wards in England and Wales with a median property price of more than £1,000 per square foot were in London. Knightsbridge and Belgravia (£2,237) and the ward next door, Brompton and Hans (£2,022), were top of the list and the only two areas in the country where the figure exceeded £2,000. However, two wards in Oxford – Summertown and Walton Manor – and three in areas to the south-west of London were the fastest risers. “The market in north Oxford has the classic drivers of great properties, shopping and schools,” said William Kirkland, the head of Knight Frank’s Oxford office. “From Summertown you can walk to some very good state and independent schools, which is why people are still choosing to come here from London.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Asking prices for UK homes show record rise, as demand exceeds supply",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/asking-prices-for-uk-homes-show-record-rise-as-demand-exceeds-supply
2/21/2022,"Here is a play that seems custom-built for a mainstage tour. It has popular hit written all over it. A vigorous debut by writer and director Eilidh Loan, it is male-centred working-class comedy in the tradition of Roddy McMillan’s The Bevellers and John Byrne’s The Slab Boys. It is funny yet bittersweet, raucous yet sentimental, angry yet celebratory. If many of its themes feel familiar, it makes for no less of a good night out. Working in Loan’s favour is the truth of her story. Had this been fiction, she would have had to tone down the litany of tragedies that befall the seven young men who form an amateur football team in 1980s Renfrew, near Paisley. The production is driven by a tremendous life force, not least because of its crisply executed choreography, but the play is stalked by death.  Moorcroft is inspired by the recollections of Loan’s father, Garry, 54, a keen footballer in his youth. He is played by Martin Docherty, wiry, fly and fast-talking, as a man looking back at the squad he brought together as a Tuesday-night escape from dreary lives in Thatcher’s Britain. Loan doesn’t say where fact and fiction meet, but the parka worn on stage by Kyle Gardiner’s bright-eyed Sooty, a young victim of cancer, is the very coat treasured by a real-life friend of her father’s. We can assume the team’s trajectory from optimism to despair distils the experience of many young men struggling against the odds. Certainly, the play’s themes are real. Loan works in set-piece speeches about race, homosexuality and cancer as she considers the men’s vulnerability to mental illness. Yes, it is convenient that every off-colour remark is countered by an enlightened liberal argument, but Loan’s humanism pushes the play towards a touching portrayal of men who love each other even if they lack the language to say so. What they do have is the language to cajole, mock and make merry, a characteristic Loan captures brilliantly in a script that is as funny in execution as it is serious in purpose. Happily, this is a team effort and her excellent ensemble power home the goals. Moorcroft is at Tron, Glasgow, until 5 March.",Arts/Stage,Moorcroft review – bittersweet football comedy is right on target,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/21/moorcroft-review-tron-glasgow
2/21/2022,"Two halves of a rare signed manuscript of lyrics by Jimi Hendrix have been pieced together 55 years after they were torn in two. The legendary guitarist was in the early stages of his career when his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, played the Bath Pavilion on the evening of 20 February 1967, standing in for Chuck Berry who had cancelled.  Before the concert, two local girls, aged 15 and 16, made their way to the backstage door in search of an autograph. Hendrix stepped out to meet them but had no blank paper. Instead, he tore out a page from an exercise book he had to hand, ripped it in half and signed both pieces. Fellow band members Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding also added their signatures. As the teenagers walked home after the gig they turned over the pieces of paper to find handwritten lyrics headed “51st Wedding Anniversary” with the side heading “Key of B”. Just three weeks later, 51st Anniversary was released as the B-side to Hendrix’s second top-10 UK chart hit Purple Haze. The two friends drifted apart as their lives took different directions, taking the two pieces ofpaper with them. However, last year one of the women approached Lancashire-based rock’n’roll memorabilia store Tracks Limited for a quote for her set of autographs. At the request of Tracks, the seller managed to track down her friend – despite limited contact over the past five decades – in Bath to find she had also kept her piece of the page intact. Both women, who wish to remain anonymous, agreed to sell their halves of the manuscript, which is now valued at a five-figure sum. Paul Wane, owner of Tracks, said: “There are extremely few Jimi Hendrix manuscripts in existence and even fewer that have been signed by Jimi and the other two members of the Experience.” Hendrix formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1966. They scored hits, particularly in the UK, with a cover of All Along the Watchtower and original songs Voodoo Chile and Purple Haze. The group broke up in 1969 after Redding’s departure. Last month, it was reported that Hendrix’s estate is suing his former bandmates’ heirs after they allegedly threatened to sue for “millions of pounds” in unpaid royalties dating back decades. Hendrix died in September 1970 at the age of 27. Redding died in 2003 and Mitchell in 2008. Lawyers for the group’s rhythm section claim that “both died in relative poverty having never received their true entitlement from their works, performances and founding membership of the Jimi Hendrix Experience”. In a case filed on 18 January in Manhattan, the Hendrix estate and Sony Music, the exclusive licence-holder of Hendrix’s catalogue, requested a legal declaration stating that they owed nothing to the men’s heirs.",Arts/Music,Two halves of signed Jimi Hendrix lyric sheet reunited after 55 years,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/21/two-halves-signed-jimi-hendrix-lyric-sheet-reunited-55-years
2/21/2022,"David Hockney’s latest self-portrait, painted in Normandy, will be on view for the first time in a new exhibition of the artist’s work opening at the University of Cambridge. Hockney’s Eye: The Art and Technology of Depiction, explores the ways in which the renowned British artist sees and depicts art. It will open in March across the university’s Fitzwilliam Museum and the Heong Gallery, Downing College.  Alongside the self-portrait, which was painted last November, the exhibition features a number of other works not publicly seen before in the UK. Jane Munro, a co-curator at the Fitzwilliam Museum, said the exhibition was the first “to give serious scholarly scrutiny to Hockney’s ideas as well as his art”. Through paintings, drawings, iPad paintings and video, to optical devices and innovative 3D modelling, she said the show “explores Hockney’s views about how the art of the past was created, what he learned from it and how he transformed it”. Hockney has been known to criticise both photography and linear “Renaissance” perspective for its lines receding to a single point, saying they are untrue to our real experience of the visual environment. “The world is big,” he has written. “The eye is connected to the mind … we see with memory … A photograph sees it all at once – in one click of the lens from a single point of view – but we don’t.” It was a visit to a exhibition by the draughtsman Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres at the National Gallery in 1999 that triggered Hockney’s interest in the use of optical tools by artists before the advent of photography in 1839. He said optical instruments “do not draw for you”, an idea that proved controversial among art historians and which featured in his 2001 book Secret Knowledge. In the Fitzwilliam Museum’s picture galleries, Hockney’s drawings, paintings and digital artworks will be displayed alongside historic works by artists including William Hogarth, Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, John Constable and Andy Warhol. The display at the Heong Gallery will chart Hockney’s pioneering approaches to capturing space and visual reality from the 1960s to the present day. Starting with a drawing made while at the Royal College of Art in 1959, the display will move on to his iconic American paintings of the 60s and early 70s, photo collages from the 80s, and an early digital drawing. It will culminate in a wall-length digital work featuring the artist’s recent experiments with digital photography. A selection of drawings he made using the camera lucida in 1999-2000, including Ian McKellen and Damien Hirst, will be on show in the Dutch Gallery. Hockney’s After Hobbema (Useful Knowledge) 2017, will hang alongside Meindert Hobbema’s The Avenue at Middelharnis, 1689 on loan from the National Gallery. Martin Gayford, co-curator of Hockney’s Eye and an author who has written numerous books with Hockney, said the exhibition was a “new look at the artist’s own work, seeing it as lifelong quest to find new ways to represent the world around us, pictures that are closer to human experience; simultaneously the exhibition considers art history from Hockney’s point of view, placing his pictures next to impressionist landscapes and Georgian portraits.” Luke Syson, the director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, said it was an “exhibition that we think will feel at home in a place where the arts and sciences meet on equal terms”.",Arts/Art and design,David Hockney exhibition will feature artist’s latest self-portrait,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/21/david-hockney-exhibition-will-feature-artists-latest-self-portrait
