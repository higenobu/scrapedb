12/25/2021,"Nasa has launched a powerful infrared telescope, a successor to Hubble, which scientists believe will be the most important space-science observatory of the next decade. The $9bn James Webb space telescope was packed into the cargo bay of an Ariane 5 rocket that blasted off from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) launch base in French Guiana at 12.20pm on Saturday.  If all goes according to plan, the instrument is to be released from the French-built rocket after a 26-minute ride into space, before spending a month coasting towards its destination in solar orbit about a million miles from Earth – roughly four times more distant than the moon.

12/25/2021,"We hoped this would be the year everything would come right: that concert venues would buzz with capacity crowds; that musicians would be back in full-time work; that soloists might again travel without fear of quarantine and testing (quite aside from the unresolved difficulties caused by Brexit) – above all, that Covid-19 would vanish. Instead, Omicron gallops ahead and even optimists must accept we’re not there yet. For all the cancellations and underlying mood of chaos, countless musical events touched lives. The BBC Proms, cautiously but definitively, were back, with premieres from Charlotte Bray, Shiva Feshareki, Britta Byström, Grace-Evangeline Mason, George Benjamin and more. Highlights included John Wilson and his lithe Sinfonia of London; the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, revelatory in Mozart’s last symphonies; the Icelandic pianist Víkingur Ólafsson wowing the crowds in his Proms debut. Another pianist, Janeba Kanneh-Mason, introduced Florence Price’s one-movement concerto to the Proms.  Podium exits and arrivals shaped the season: Domingo Hindoyan took over from Vasily Petrenko at the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. Petrenko himself injected vitality into his own “new” orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic. After a triumphant five years, Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla announced her forthcoming departure from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra; Kazuki Yamada, from 2023, is her successor. Esa-Pekka Salonen said goodbye to the Philharmonia; Santtu-Matias Rouvali has already made a thrilling splash as his replacement. Succeeding Vladimir Jurowski, Edward Gardner launched his innings with the LPO, electrifying in Tippett’s The Midsummer Marriage. As some regretfully anticipated, Simon Rattle will shorten his stay with the London Symphony Orchestra to work more in Germany, now his home. Antonio Pappano will take over (from 2024); his successor at Covent Garden has yet to be announced. Opera struggled back to the main stages, with Janáček at the Royal Opera and Glyndebourne, Wagner at English National Opera, Puccini at Welsh National Opera, Bizet at Opera North, Gilbert and Sullivan at Scottish Opera, and at ENO too. The ever adaptable smaller “country house” venues fared well. Longborough built a big top for Monteverdi. Grange Park was strict with social distancing, with Bryn Terfel as Verdi’s Falstaff a star attraction. Garsington’s airy pavilion, with striking Richard Strauss and Handel, might have been designed with a pandemic factored into its risk assessment. Opera Holland Park cleverly reconfigured its entire auditorium for the benefit of audiences. Covid and its ring road of consequence kept me closer to home than usual, often at events in non-traditional venues: a reminder that quality of performance takes precedence over a perfect acoustic. Grimeborn enthralled in Arcola’s new urban “barn”. Bold Tendencies, winner of this year’s Royal Philharmonic Society Gamechanger award, lured the Philharmonia into its car park space for Brahms’s two piano concertos in one evening (herculean soloist Samson Tsoy, conductor Maxim Emelyanychev). Waterperry Opera charmed in a rustic glade. West Wycombe chamber music festival was a discovery. There were losses. The softly gracious Dutch conductor Bernard Haitink, mighty and fiery the moment he lifted his baton, died aged 92. The death from coronavirus of opera director extraordinaire Graham Vick left us reeling. Composer Anthony Payne and singer Jane Manning, the husband-wife partnership who illuminated musical life for over half a century, died within weeks of each other, gone like the abrupt felling of great oaks. The composers Louis Andriessen, Simon Bainbridge and Frederic Rzewski, as well as the genre-bending Stephen Sondheim, all left us, as did the librettist Amanda Holden and the mezzo-soprano Pamela Helen Stephen. A performance that lives on: in January, the pianist András Schiff, in between playing incomparable Bach in a live online Wigmore Hall recital, gave a commentary of such obscure humour that I listened back four times to be sure I had understood. I can’t recall the jokes, but Schiff’s Bach has blazed in the mind throughout this troubled year. 1.

12/25/2021,"It’s a saccharine sweet story about a young deer who finds love and friendship in a forest. But the original tale of Bambi, adapted by Disney in 1942, has much darker beginnings as an existential novel about persecution and antisemitism in 1920s Austria. Now, a new translation seeks to reassert the rightful place of Felix Salten’s 1923 masterpiece in adult literature and shine a light on how Salten was trying to warn the world that Jews would be terrorised, dehumanised and murdered in the years to come. Far from being a children’s story, Bambi was actually a parable about the inhumane treatment and dangerous precariousness of Jews and other minorities in what was then an increasingly fascist world, the new translation will show.  In 1935, the book was banned by the Nazis, who saw it as a political allegory on the treatment of Jews in Europe and burned it as Jewish propaganda. “The darker side of Bambi has always been there,” said Jack Zipes, professor emeritus of German and comparative literature at the University of Minnesota and translator of the forthcoming book. “But what happens to Bambi at the end of the novel has been concealed, to a certain extent, by the Disney corporation taking over the book and making it into a pathetic, almost stupid film about a prince and a bourgeois family.” Salten’s novel, Bambi, a Life in the Woods, is completely different he said. “It is a book about survival in your own home.” From the moment he is born, Bambi is under constant threat from hunters who invade the forest and attack indiscriminately. “They kill whatever animal they want.” It soon becomes apparent that the forest animals are living out their lives in fear and that puts the reader constantly “on edge”: “All the animals have been persecuted. And I think what shakes the reader is that there are also some animals who are traitors, who help the hunters kill.” After Bambi’s mother is murdered, so is his beloved cousin Gobo, who had been led to believe he was special and the hunters would be “kind” to him. Bambi is shot too, but survives thanks to the old prince, a majestic stag who treats him like a son (and may well be his father). But then, sadly, the old prince also dies, leaving Bambi utterly bereft. “Bambi does not survive well, at the end. He is alone, totally alone … It is a tragic story about the loneliness and solitude of Jews and other minority groups.” There is a sense at the end that Bambi and all the other wild animals in the forest are merely “born to be killed”. They know they will be hunted – and they know they will die. “The major theme throughout is: you don’t have a choice.” Salten, who had changed his name from Siegmund Salzmann during his teens to “unmark” himself as a Jew in Austrian society, earned his main income as a journalist in Vienna. Zipes thinks he could see the direction in which the political winds were blowing. “I think he foresaw the Holocaust. He had suffered greatly as a young boy from antisemitism and at that time, in Austria and Germany, Jews were blamed for the loss of the first world war. This novel is an appeal to say: no, this shouldn’t happen.” At one point in the novel, two leaves on a tree discuss why they must fall to the ground and wonder what will happen to them when they do. “These leaves talk very seriously about really dark questions humans have: we don’t know what is going to happen to us when we die. We don’t know why we must die.” By writing a story about animals and wildlife, Salten could get past the negative preconceptions and prejudices many of his readers held about Jews and other minorities: “It enabled him to talk about the persecution of the Jews as freely as he wanted to.” Without being didactic, he could encourage the reader to feel more empathy towards oppressed groups – and Bambi could openly question the cruelty of their oppressors. “Many other writers, like George Orwell, chose animals too because you’re freer to tackle problems that might make your readers bristle. And you don’t want them to bristle, you want them to say, at the end: this is a tragedy.” Importantly, the new translation, which will be published on 18 January by Princeton Press, attempts to convey in English for the first time the way that certain characters in Salten’s novel have a Viennese “flair” when they talk in German. “The animals have wonderful ways of talking, which makes you feel as though you are in a Viennese cafe. And you immediately recognise that they’re not talking how animals talk. These are human beings.” By contrast, the original English translation, which was published in 1928, toned down Salten’s anthropomorphism and changed its focus so that it was more likely to be understood as a simple conservation story about animals living in a forest. This was the version read by Walt Disney, who loved animal stories. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Salten managed to flee to Switzerland. By then, he had sold the film rights for a mere $1,000 to an American director, who then sold them on to Disney: Salten himself never earned a penny from the famous animation. Stripped of his Austrian citizenship by the Nazis, he spent his final years “lonely and in despair” in Zurich and died in 1945, like Bambi, with no safe place to call home.",News/News,"Bambi: cute, lovable, vulnerable ... or a dark parable of antisemitic terror?",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/dec/25/bambi-cute-lovable-vulnerable-or-a-dark-parable-of-antisemitic-terror
12/25/2021,"Pope Francis has used his Christmas Day message to call for dialogue on the world stage as he looks to resolve conflicts ranging from family feuds to threats of war. The pontiff listed tensions in several countries in Asia, Europe and Africa as he delivered his Urbi et Orbi address, and called on individuals and world leaders to talk rather than dig in their heels. This aversion to discourse, he said, has been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic.  “Our capacity for social relationships is sorely tried; there is a growing tendency to withdraw, to do it all by ourselves, to stop making an effort to encounter others and do things together,” he said from the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican. “On the international level, too, there is the risk of avoiding dialogue; the risk that this complex crisis will lead to taking shortcuts rather than setting out on the longer paths of dialogue. Yet only those paths can lead to the resolution of conflicts and to lasting benefits for all.” He added: “We continue to witness a great number of conflicts, crises and disagreements. These never seem to end; by now we hardly even notice them. We have become so used to them that immense tragedies are now being passed over in silence, we risk not hearing the cry of pain and distress of so many of our brothers and sisters.” Before an unusually small crowd, which was reduced by Covid restrictions and the weather to only several hundred, he asked God to “give serenity and unity to families”, praising those who strive to keep them and communities together in such divisive times. “Let us ask him for the strength to be open to dialogue. On this festive day, let us implore him to stir up in the hearts of everyone a yearning for reconciliation and fraternity.” He used the word “dialogue” 11 times in a speech of little more than two pages as he spoke to people huddled under rain parkas and umbrellas. The day before, during his Christmas Eve midnight mass in St Peter’s Basilica, the pontiff had called for more solidarity with those living in poverty. He urged the congregation of about 2,000 people to “value the little things in life”, adding: “On this night of love, may we have only one fear: that of offending God’s love, hurting him by despising the poor with our indifference.” The pope referred to the shepherds who Christians believe watched over the infant son of God. “That is where Jesus is born: close to them, close to the forgotten ones of the peripheries,” he told the faithful. “He comes where human dignity is put to the test. He comes to ennoble the excluded and he first reveals himself to them; not to educated and important people, but to poor working people. “God tonight comes to fill with dignity the austerity of labour. He reminds us of the importance of granting dignity to men and women through labour, but also of granting dignity to human labour itself, since man is its master and not its slave. On the day of life, let us repeat: no more deaths in the workplace. And let us commit ourselves to ensuring this.”",News/World news,Pope calls for dialogue on world stage in Christmas message,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/25/pope-calls-for-dialogue-on-the-world-stage-in-his-christmas-message
