4/8/2022,"Liverpool have finalised a deal for Fabio Carvalho that will see the exciting winger join from Fulham for €5m (£4.17m) plus add-ons in the summer, bringing to an end a chase the club had failed to complete on deadline day of the most recent transfer window. Carvalho was all set to swap west London for Merseyside in January after negotiations between both parties eventually led to a £8.4m fee being agreed upon – Fulham had rejected Liverpool’s opening offer of £5m – but ultimately time ran out for the transfer to be rubber-stamped, in large part due to the complex nature of the talks. Jürgen Klopp never lost interest in the 19-year-old, however, and with his contract ending in the summer, was determined to sign him before he became a free transfer and thus hugely attractive to rival bidders. That was relatively easy to organise given Carvalho had agreed personal terms with Liverpool, as well as completing a medical, when he appeared to set to join them a little over two months ago. He will now do so on 1 July – when his contract with Fulham expires – with the transfer expected to be officially announced next month. The add-on payments will be in the region of €2.7m (£2.25m) with Liverpool also agreeing to a £20% sell-on fee. Carvalho, who can also operate as an attacking midfielder, was born in Portugal but is an England Under-21 international. He joined Fulham’s academy at the age of eight and having made his debut in a 2-0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in September 2020, quickly became a first-team regular. He has made 31 appearances for Marco Silva’s side in all competitions this season, scoring eight goals and providing seven assists and could well face Fulham next season given they appear poised for an immediate return to the Premier League as Championship champions. They are currently top of the division, five points clear of second-place Bournemouth and 17 points clear of third-place Huddersfield. Carvalho’s contract with Liverpool will last until 2027 and he is expected to be on their pre-season tour to the far east ahead of the 2022-23 campaign.",Sport/Football,Liverpool finalise deal to sign Fabio Carvalho from Fulham for £4.17m ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/liverpool-finalise-deal-to-sign-fabio-carvalho-from-fulham-for-48m
4/8/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s wife pays £30,000 a year to secure her non-domiciled tax status, her spokesperson has confirmed and accepted it was possible that Akshata Murty uses the status to take advantage of tax havens for income earned outside the UK. As political pressure increased on the chancellor and his spouse, the spokesperson said Murty had no plans to say where she pays tax on overseas income as that information was not “relevant”. The spokesperson declined to elaborate on the initial explanation for Murty’s non-dom tax status – the fact she has Indian citizenship – when this would still mean such a tax arrangement was a choice. They accepted it was possible that Murty’s arrangements meant she minimised her tax using tax havens. They said no further details would be given, other than to say that Murty abided by all necessary rules. Labour called for clarity over her tax arrangements, while Keir Starmer said it would be “breathtaking hypocrisy” if she had been reducing her liabilities while the chancellor was raising taxes on others. There was also concern from some Conservative MPs, with one former minister saying the revelation was particularly unfortunate on the day the national insurance rise came into force. “The perception is, what is the problem? Here is someone worth £3bn who has a different tax arrangement. I’m sure everything is above board but that’s not the point.” Murty receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from a stake in her family’s IT business empire, Infosys, which is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. Under UK tax laws, Murty’s status as a non-dom means she does not have to pay tax on dividend payments from overseas companies. UK resident taxpayers currently pay up to 39.35% tax on foreign dividend payouts. It is not known where she pays tax on this overseas income. It previously emerged that Murty is a shareholder in a restaurant business that funnelled investments through the tax haven of Mauritius. Asked where Murty paid tax on her overseas income, a spokesperson said Murty had no plans to comment on this because it “doesn’t seem relevant”. While both the non-dom status and the possibility of minimising tax by moving overseas income through tax havens would be entirely legal, it would seem politically difficult for Sunak to benefit financially in such a way, especially while he has been raising taxes in the UK. It also remains unclear why Murty has non-dom status. After it was revealed by the Independent, a spokesperson said it was because she was a citizen of India, which does not allow Indians to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously, meaning she “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”. However, tax experts have said non-dom status is not automatic but a choice. Prof Richard Murphy, a Sheffield University academic who co-founded the Tax Justice Network, said: “Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. In other words, the claims made in the statement issued by Ms Murty are wrong, and as evidence, just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK.” The spokesperson did not comment on the apparent contradiction. The Labour MP Chris Bryant said the situation needed to be explained. “This is just wrong. Non-dom status is not automatic and the Treasury needs to urgently clarify this inaccurate statement. “After shutting down legitimate questions about Infosys and its operations in Russia last week, it’s time for Rishi Sunak to come clean.” Starmer said Sunak “has very, very serious questions to answer”. The Labour leader told Sky News that Sunak had repeatedly raised taxes. “He says all of this is necessary, there’s no option. If it now transpires that his wife has been using schemes to reduce her own tax, then I’m afraid that is breathtaking hypocrisy. “We need complete transparency on this, so that we can all understand what schemes she may have been using to reduce her own tax.” Earlier the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted that the chancellor and his wife had been “incredibly transparent” about the arrangement, but was unable to say whether she paid tax on foreign earnings in India or another jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “She’s an Indian citizen. And so she, as you say, pays tax here on UK income, but pays tax abroad on foreign income.” But asked where she paid tax abroad – in India or elsewhere such as the Cayman Islands – Kwarteng said: “I don’t know anything about her tax affairs.”",News/Politics,Akshata Murty says it’s not ‘relevant’ to say where she pays tax overseas,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/rishi-sunaks-wife-says-its-not-relevant-to-say-where-she-pays-tax-overseas
4/8/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has ramped up his warnings of the danger posed by Marine Le Pen before the first-round vote in the presidential election this weekend, as he acknowledged he had not managed to contain all voters’ fears and hold back the far right during his time in office. As Macron campaigns to become the first French president in 20 years to serve a second term, he has often been reminded of his 2017 victory speech in front of the Louvre where, after defeating Le Pen with 66% of the vote, he promised to ensure people had “no more reason to vote for extremes”. Polls suggest he could once again go through to a second-round runoff against Le Pen after this Sunday’s vote, and that she would significantly close the gap on him in a 24 April final round, with a Harris poll this week putting Macron on 51.5% to Le Pen’s 48.5%. Le Pen has risen steadily in recent days, boosted by her promises to cut VAT on fuel in response to the cost of living crisis. Her political opponents have continued to warn that her anti-immigration project to prioritise native French people over non-French for housing, jobs and benefits, and to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public spaces, is xenophobic, racist and against the French constitution. In a front-page interview with Le Figaro on Thursday, Macron was asked if he bore part of the responsibility for the high support for the far right in the polls. Macron said he believed his government had “succeeded in attacking” certain factors of the far right vote by lowering unemployment, creating jobs and beginning a process whereby factories opened after long years of deindustrialisation. “But when you lead, govern or are president, you always have a part of responsibility,” he added. “On immigration, the results are insufficient, but we have reinforced border protections and hardened entry conditions to our territory in a context where the flow has considerably increased … due to the international context.” He said there had been more arrivals to France between 2017 and 2019 than in the two years previously. “A worry was born out of that: I haven’t managed to calm it, and it has fed the extremes.” But he added that France was not “submerged” by immigration. He said that if he won a second term, he would “reinforce the fight against illegal immigration” and facilitate sending home people who had not been approved to stay. Macron said the far right in France was still “fundamentally” the same: it attacked the Republic, had a base of antisemitism, “very clear xenophobia, and ultraconservative aims”. Support for the far right in the polls for the first round is at its highest point: Le Pen and her far-right rival Eric Zemmour, a former talkshow pundit, have more than 30% of support between them. Polls show Macron in first position for the first round on about 26.5%. Le Pen has risen to 23% in recent days. The hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon is in third on about 17% and also rising. A high number of undecided voters and a potentially high abstention rate means the outcome of Sunday’s first round remains open. Macron said Mélenchon’s hard-left movement was not in the same category as the far right but brought “simplistic arguments and counter-truths which cultivate fears” in the same way. Asked in another newspaper interview why he had not held back the tide of the far right, Macron said: “Extremes feed on fears, and fears are there: climate, geopolitics, the pandemic … I tried to bring answers. But when there are fears and big changes, the strategy of scapegoating works much better.” Macron has promised to use a second term to cut taxes further, bring France to full employment after decades of mass unemployment, and raise the retirement age to 65. He said inflation in France was half the rate in the UK because the government had taken efficient measures to block electricity price rises and provided anti-inflation payments to low-income households. Le Pen on Thursday brushed aside the worries of the financial markets over her rise in the polls. France’s borrowing costs rose as investors grew jittery over a closer-than-expected race. “The policies I want to implement are not meant for the stock markets, which will be a change from Emmanuel Macron,” she told RTL radio. Le Pen insisted that if elected she would ban the Muslim headscarf from all public spaces, including the street. She said it would be enforced by police in the same way as seatbelt-wearing in cars. “People will be given a fine in the same way that it is illegal to not wear your seatbelt. It seems to me that the police are very much able to enforce this measure,” she said. Le Pen said the government’s tactic of catastrophising over her possible election no longer worked. “Scaremongering which entails saying that unless Emmanuel Macron is re-elected it will be a crisis, the sun will be extinguished, the sea will disappear and we’ll suffer an invasion of frogs no longer works.”",News/World news,Macron steps up warnings over French far right before first-round vote,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/macron-steps-up-warnings-over-french-far-right-before-first-round-vote
4/8/2022,"“If you’ve been paying attention to the news this week, I’m so sorry,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show, “because there is now a mountain of evidence that Russia has engaged in a series of brutal war crimes”. In response to reports of Russia targeting civilians and blocking humanitarian access, the US announced Wednesday new sanctions on Russian financial institutions and individuals. “Good. I hope it makes a difference,” said Colbert. “But at this point, there are so many sanctions on Russia we might run out of places to put them. We’ll have to start sanctioning them in the multiverse. They’re going to have to block transactions with Russian banks that are in the dimension where Spiderman is still Tobey Maguire.” The latest sanctions package will, among other things, ban all new investments in Russia. “Well, you’ve got to, otherwise their soaring economy is an irresistible cash magnet,” Colbert deadpanned. Colbert also mocked Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk, who “after years of tweeting silly memes and bad takes while at the same time constantly criticizing Twitter’s business practices,” bought a 9.2% stake in the company for $2.9bn, making him the largest single shareholder. “Wait a second! So if he doesn’t like how a corporation operates, he just buys it?” Colbert said. “How much more evidence do we need that he’s turning into a supervillain?” One of Musk’s first tweets post-sale was a poll asking: “do you want an edit button?” “Sure! I mean, I’d rather you cancel the accounts of all the Nazis, but an edit button would be nice,” Colbert responded. On Late Night Seth Meyers tore into the congressional campaign of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. “I think Palin is in for a rude awakening if she thinks she’s still on the vanguard of wild and crazy Republicans,” said Meyers. “Palin showing up in Congress now would be like me telling a bunch of high school kids about my wild days of sneaking out and drinking wine coolers in the woods, and then realizing I was talking to the kids from Euphoria,” he continued. “They’d be like, ‘cool, man, I put molly on my oatmeal.’” “As if to prove that Sarah Palin would somehow not be the craziest Republican in Congress if she won,” Florida congressman Matt Gaetz “leveled a bunch of unhinged conspiracies” at defense secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday. Gaetz, who is under federal investigation for sex trafficking, claimed the military cares more about critical race theory and “woke-ism” than national defense and wondered if the pull-out from Afghanistan last year would have gone better “if the national defense university actually worked a little more on strategy and a little less on woke-ism.” “What is wrong with these people?” Meyers wondered. “In their fever swamp brains, do they genuinely believe our soldiers no longer know how to fire a rifle because they are buried from homework in pronoun class? Does he think they arrive on the battlefield and the sergeant barks out ‘alright Bravo team, go around the left flank and tell the enemy they’re beautiful just the way you are!’ “I have no problem with tough questioning of our national security officials, and I’m all for cutting the defense budget,” Meyers added. “It’s massively inflated and we could absolutely spend it better elsewhere, but that’s not even what the scam artists like Gaetz are asking for. They just want to whine about woke-ism and critical race theory. They don’t actually want to cut defense spending.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the saga of an aggressive rabid fox at the Capitol, which bit several people on Tuesday. Representative Ami Bera, among the bitten, said the loose fox marked “one of the most unusual days on the hill in 10 years”. “Yeah, with the exception of all those nutjobs trying to hang Mike Pence, but this was a solid number two,” Kimmel joked. Kimmel also remarked on a new round of sanctions on Russia. “I’m surprised they have any sanctions left,” he said. The new rounds target Russian banks and two of Putin’s adult children. “Wouldn’t it be something if what finally got Putin to stop this is his daughter going ‘Dad! They cut off my credit card, you’ve got to do something!’” Kimmel said. “Can you imagine Vladimir as a dad-imir?” he added. “It seems like he would be a very strict father. When his kids misbehave, instead of their rooms they get sent to Siberia.”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on Russia: ‘We’ll have to start sanctioning them in the multiverse’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/07/stephen-colbert-russia-sanctions-late-night
4/8/2022,"One of the classic teen idols of the late 1950s and early 60s, Bobby Rydell, who has died from complications of pneumonia aged 79, was only seven when he began performing on stage in his home town of Philadelphia. Over the following 70 years, he would sing everything from rock’n’roll and smoochy love songs to disco, Broadway classics and Italian pop tunes. He notched up 19 singles in the Billboard Top 40, among the most successful of them We Got Love, Wild One and Volare. It was fitting that his name was chosen for Rydell high school in Grease, the Broadway and later film musical that depicted teenage lives in the early rock’n’roll days of the late 50s. If, as a New York Times critic put it, he was “more like a crooner than a rocker”, Rydell’s photogenic looks and endearing personality ensured he would prove far more durable than many flashier, more confrontational artists. Rydell and many of his generation were knocked off their pop pedestals by the dramatic arrival of the Beatles and their British counterparts, but he had the staying power of mainstream performers from a slightly earlier generation. He was born Robert Ridarelli in Philadelphia, the son of Jennie (nee Sapienza) and Adrio “Al” Ridarelli. His father was the foreman in a machine shop. Bobby grew up on South 11th Street, and in 1995 his career achievements were recognised by his home city when the street was renamed Bobby Rydell Boulevard. There is also a mural of Rydell on the boardwalk of Wildwood, New Jersey, the beach resort that inspired his 1963 hit Wildwood Days. His father kindled his musical interest by taking him to see the jazz bands of Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman, and he began playing drums and singing in nightclubs in Philadelphia and New Jersey at the age of seven. When he was nine, young Robert won a spot on the television show Paul Whiteman’s TV Teen Club and became a regular cast member. After three years on the show, he branched out into performing with local bands, including Rocco and the Saints – in which a fellow Philadelphian, Frankie Avalon, played the trumpet – and changed his name to Rydell. After cutting a few unsuccessful singles, Rydell signed to Cameo Records, and made his first appearance on the charts with the exuberant Kissin’ Time (1959). The follow-up, We Got Love, sold a million copies, igniting a streak of hits including Wild One, Swingin’ School, Ding-A-Ling and Volare. In 1961, aged 19 and now a confirmed teen heart-throb, he became the youngest performer to headline at the fabled Copacabana club in New York. In 1963 he was cast as Hugo Peabody in the film version of the musical Bye Bye Birdie, alongside Ann-Margret and Dick Van Dyke. Rydell recalled how the film’s director, George Sidney, “saw some kind of magic between Ann-Margret and myself, and every day that I went back to Columbia Studios, my script got bigger, and bigger, and bigger”. He was a regular guest on numerous TV shows, including those hosted by Red Skelton, Jack Benny, Joey Bishop, Perry Como and George Burns. “I had the good fortune to spend my peak years as a recording artist during the golden age of the TV variety show,” he wrote in his autobiography, Bobby Rydell: Teen Idol on the Rocks – A Tale of Second Chances (2016). His international reputation was boosted by tours in Europe and others to Australia – where he would tour 20 times – Japan and the far east. The Beatles scrambled to meet him when he visited Britain in 1963, and Paul McCartney has said that the Lennon and McCartney song She Loves You was based on a Rydell song, though he did not specify which one (Swingin’ School is a likely candidate). Nonetheless, by 1964 Rydell’s hits were drying up, though he reached No 4 that year with Forget Him, and his generation of performers was sidelined by the seismic impact of the Beatles and the British Invasion. His last appearance on Billboard’s Hot 100 was in 1965 with Diana, which reached No 98. Even signing a deal with Frank Sinatra’s Reprise label in 1968 could not reverse the slide, with Rydell complaining that Reprise gave him no promotion. Rydell could still command enough audience loyalty to tour regularly and appear in nightclubs and Las Vegas venues through the 1970s and 80s, performing the great American songbook of material by the likes of Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Richard Rodgers alongside his repertoire of pop and easy-listening material. He enjoyed a further glimmer of chart success with a disco version of his song Sway in 1976. In 1985 he joined Avalon and another former teen pop star, Fabian, to form a touring act, the Golden Boys. In 2020 he recalled: “I said to Frankie … ‘this is great, but how long is this going to last? A year, two years tops, it’s over.’ Well, that was in 1985, and we’re going on 2021, and we’re still doing the show. It’s amazing.” There had been some rocky moments along the way. The death of his wife, Camille Quattrone, in 2003, after 35 years of marriage, tipped him into life-threatening alcoholism. “Vodka became a very, very dear friend,” he said, “to the point where, a few years later, it led to a double transplant. A new liver and a new kidney, because of all the drinking.” He married Linda Hoffman in 2009. His alcohol-induced illness forced him to cancel an Australian tour in 2012. After transplant surgery, he returned to the stage the following year with three sold-out shows in Las Vegas. His career had “had its ups and downs, its peaks and valleys”, he said, “but I’ve survived through all of that, and I continue to do what I really enjoy doing”. He is survived by Linda and by two children, Robert and Jennifer, from his first marriage.

4/8/2022,"Sarina Wiegman has praised the development of Leah Williamson, who is yet to start at a major international tournament for England but will captain the team at the Euros this summer, as the Lionesses prepare to face North Macedonia in World Cup qualifying on Friday. Williamson was on the fringes at the 2019 Women’s World Cup, with the six minutes the Arsenal defender played against Cameroon, having been brought on as a late substitute by Phil Neville, her only action of the tournament in France. Not only is Williamson set to be in the starting XI when the Euros get going at Old Trafford on 6 July but she will do so wearing the armband. “I followed her before I came in here as the manager, she’s a very talented player,” said Wiegman, England’s head coach. “Now, she has so many more high-level and high-intensity games in her legs and in her brain. That has really helped her. She’s more mature, she can still grow – I’m still growing, we’re all still growing every day – but she’s ready for the opportunity on and off the pitch.” Wiegman denied there was a risk in making someone with so little major tournament experience the national team captain at a home Euros. She said: “She’s herself and she won’t be a different person when she wears the armband. I do think that we have shared responsibilities, so what we shouldn’t do is put it all on the shoulders of Leah. As a team we all have responsibilities and, when it’s needed, she steps up and talks or uses her way of leadership.” England will be without Williamson for the game in Skopje with the 25-year-old having missed training and being under precautionary concussion protocols. The hope is she will be fit for Tuesday’s game with Northern Ireland. “She is doing well,” said Wiegman. “She came into camp good, but we didn’t want to take any risks. She had a little bit of a headache, so we take the medical protocols. She just needs to take a little more time in her programme to build her up. Also, no heading [in training] so she’s not ready for the game on Friday.” England will also be without Williamson’s Arsenal centre-back partner Lotte Wubben-Moy and Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood for Friday’s game, with the pair having not travelled due to knee and thigh injuries respectively. Everton’s Gabby George, who was in camp with the Under-23s, has been called in. Looking ahead to the Euros, Wiegman believes her squad is in a “good place”, going on to say: “You always want more as a coach, more time, but the time schedule is so clear, you have this time, these camps, and that’s what you have and you have to do your job. “I was really happy with the games we had in February, they were really competitive, this is another opponent, we all know the reason why we play these matches [so close to the Euros], because Covid delayed things, so we just have to deal with the situation and be agile. We know 6 July we have to be ready for the Euros.” ",Sport/Football,Wiegman insists there is no risk making Williamson the new England captain,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/wiegman-insists-there-is-no-risk-making-williamson-the-new-england-captain
4/8/2022,"Formula One returns to Australia this weekend after a two-year absence since the sport’s blase attitude toward the oncoming pandemic left it reeling when the meeting in Melbourne fell apart. Mismanagement and hubris had brought F1 low but, finally back at Albert Park, it could not be in ruder health. F1’s insistence on pushing on with holding the race in 2020 was wildly over-ambitious, up to and including allowing fans to turn up at the gates, only not to be admitted as the event was called off with Covid cases among the teams. That weekend was a nadir for F1’s owners and the FIA. But the recovery since has been nothing short of remarkable. As other sports floundered, F1 put on 17 races in 2020 and a further 22 in 2021, including one of the great championship fights. This season the plan is to hold 23 races and, last week, F1 announced a race in Las Vegas next year. The significance of which goes far beyond the mere publicity and glamour of staging a race on the Strip. The Las Vegas GP will take place in November, on a Saturday at 10pm, the usual Sunday afternoon scheduling summarily dismissed in order to hit prime time TV in the United States. With Miami and Texas already on the calendar, the US will host three meetings in 2023. Given the sport’s recent history there, this is an extraordinary feat. F1 enjoyed great popularity in the US in the 60s and 70s, with Watkins Glen rammed with fans, but it has struggled since. From the 1980s on there were periods without a GP, while the brief spell at Indianapolis between 2000 and 2007 ended in ignominy. Racing only returned in 2012 at Austin, a meeting that for some time struggled to bring in the numbers. Bernie Ecclestone had long tried to pull off a GP in Las Vegas but never succeeded. Since Liberty Media took over the sport in 2017, however, its efforts to drag F1 into the modern age have paid off and Vegas is the definitive evidence. A concerted effort has been made to attract a new, younger audience, targeting social media as part of making the sport accessible and aiming at a large, inclusive global demographic, rather than relying on a traditional, ageing fan base. Part of that strategy was allowing Netflix to make the Drive To Survive series about the sport. Its success has been both vindication and a priceless marketing tool, especially in the US, as recognised by F1’s CEO Stefano Domenicali. “The beauty of the growth of our sport in this country is we are reaching a lot of young people that are starting to be thrilled by our sport,” he said. “To think that next year we’re going to have three races in the US, if you think back a couple of years ago, you would say you are crazy.” Yet three races there will be as F1’s numbers come up. Austin drew in 400,000 fans over the weekend last year, while last season the US broadcaster ESPN enjoyed consistently rising viewing figures, including the sport’s highest since 1995. Both Austin and Miami are expected to be sellouts this year. Liberty has long made a point of wanting to expand in the US and, in the case of Las Vegas, it has boldly stepped up to make it a reality. The race is being promoted by F1 in conjunction with the city and a group of hotels and casinos. F1 has put itself up to take any potential losses should the event prove unpopular. It is a brave decision and something Liberty would not have dared try without the surge in the sport’s popularity. Las Vegas last hosted two unloved GPs in 1981 and 1982 on a terrible circuit built in the car park of the Caesars Palace casino, attracting poor crowds and viewing figures despite hosting championship deciders both times. This time it is hard to imagine the meeting being a failure. The 3.8-mile track will stretch around the city’s landmarks, the Strip, the Bellagio fountains, Caesars, the Paris Casino. Visually, at the very least, this is the backdrop F1’s owners have fantasised about. But it comes at a price. The season is capped at 24 races according to the current commercial agreement with the teams, a number 2023 is already set to exceed. It appears that, largely, European races are in the firing line. With Vegas, Qatar and China all set to race in 2023, there would be 25 meetings and that does not include the determination to add a meeting in Africa as soon as possible. Domenicali has already mooted the idea that some races will have to be rotated on and off the calendar in future. Belgium, France and Mexico have no contract for next year and none of them can compete financially with the big money being hurled around in the Middle East. Monaco too must be considered as at risk. The track is wholly unsuited to the large, heavy modern F1 cars and its former special status in not having to pay a hosting fee has already been removed by F1. For many European fans this is the unacceptable cost of expansion in the US, but it is the reality of a success story that sits in stark contrast to the painful humility of Australia in 2020. F1 is vibrant, popular and expanding globally. Bringing Las Vegas on board is the sign of a sport utterly confident in this roll of the dice.",Sport/Sport,Las Vegas GP signals F1’s ambition of US expansion at Europe’s expense,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/07/las-vegas-gp-signals-f1s-ambition-of-us-expansion-at-europes-expense
4/8/2022,"On 2 December 2010, I was hosting an event on behalf of the England 2018 World Cup bid outside City Hall in central London. It was toe curlingly cold. My co-host Charlotte Jackson and I were joined by Peter Crouch and David Ginola among others to celebrate England’s certain success – the first World Cup on home soil since ’66. We were favourites. It was a good bid, albeit laced with that hubris that we often fail to acknowledge. They do actually play football in other countries. A small crowd were sitting in some temporary seating as we beamed pictures back from Switzerland. We got word of the result 20 minutes before it was officially announced. The crowd had already started to ebb away when Sepp Blatter stood at the lectern and laboured over opening an envelope with the word Russia written on both sides. The director shouted down my earpiece. “Just fill for the next 10 minutes so the crowd stay for the 2022 result.” Trying to retain a withering and despondent crowd in sub-zero temperatures proved too much for my broadcasting abilities. By the time Qatar was officially given the tournament we were talking to a couple of unsuspecting dog walkers. The hot chestnut seller by the river had a bigger audience. Even our guests had gone inside. We have heard a great deal about Qatar in the following 11 years. We’ve been through the corruption allegations, the realisation that it’s hot in the summer in the Middle East and the tragedy of the (disputed) number of migrant worker deaths. And now we have the complex job of working out how to cover it. On the Guardian Football Weekly podcast the other day I asked an open question about what we should do. I genuinely don’t know the answer. Do we record one episode about human rights at the start of the tournament and then forget all about it and focus on the football? There will be countless journalists and ex pros who don’t even do that – before we even consider those taking money from Fifa to promote it. I was as guilty as anyone of nodding to the invasion of Crimea and the repression of political opposition in Russia before 2018 and then forgetting it all as England reached the semi-final. Should I have spent less time worrying about why the Croatians weren’t tired – and more questioning how this tournament was legitimising Vladimir Putin’s regime? I have no idea what, if any, impact hosting the World Cup contributed to the horrifying scenes we see today. But I don’t think I used my platform enough regardless of whether it would have made a jot of difference. The latest Amnesty International report on private security firms who employ tens of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar is pretty damning. It says they are still subject to “forced labour” and a number of other abuses and it criticises Fifa for failing “to put in place adequate processes” to address these issues. So this time around should we break off our discussion of Harry Kane’s late penalty to beat Iran to find out if the working conditions of migrants really have changed? After Ghana get retribution against Uruguay – do we talk about what life is like for the LGBTQ+ community in Qatar? As Jonathan Wilson said on the podcast, this World Cup will be one of gear changes. Journalists and broadcasters in the grounds will know that workers died providing the stadiums from where they are reporting. “Hey Max,” wrote someone on Twitter. “I hope between now and the World Cup you can work out your duty as a ‘journalist’ when covering the tournament. Because your answer of ‘I don’t know’ is a little disappointing … Feels a bit of a cop out. Let’s hope you can work out your job by the end of the year!” Is it a cop out to be unsure of yourself on such complicated issues? Or is it good to be honest? Social media can be blamed for many things, one of which is a seeming desperation for journalists and pundits of all kinds – not just within sport – to have unequivocal opinions on everything. Outrage and fury certainly get more retweets than saying: “It’s complicated and I’m just not quite sure.” Saying you don’t know, or worse, that you were wrong about something, appears now to be an admission of complete failure. The more understanding we get on the bleakness in sport below the surface, the less I really know how to cover it or what our priorities should be. Clearly this goes beyond Qatar. I routinely fail to mention Abu Dhabi’s human rights abuses during my coverage of Manchester City. I want people to ask Eddie Howe about the number of people executed in Saudi Arabia. But to what end? To get him and the players to walk out on principle and the fans to follow? It goes beyond the Middle East and human rights – the gamblification of football, the racism, the misogyny, the worrying link to domestic and sexual violence. I don’t check where all the money is coming from all the time. In December 2010, when that draw was made, social media hadn’t permeated our lives to the extent that you could scroll through war crimes while you sit on the toilet. Dejan Lovren might have hated the idea of teaching children about being open-minded towards different sexualities. Matt Le Tissier might have engaged in conspiracy theories, but they had no way of telling me. I miss that blissful ignorance. I knew nothing of Qatar, and I spent very little time thinking about human rights. “It was a different time” people say, and it feels like it was to me. Perhaps I’ll learn how to do my job by the time the World Cup begins. Now back to Frank Lampard’s excuses, Diego Simeone’s shithousery and Kalvin Phillips’s Cornish pasty shoes.",Sport/Football,Qatar 2022 raises more questions of how to navigate modern football’s moral maze | Max Rushden,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/qatar-2022-world-cup-moral-maze-comment
4/8/2022,"Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović was nine months pregnant when she walked on stage at Cannes last July for the premiere of her movie Murina. The Croatian director had flown to Europe a couple of months earlier from New York, where she lives, after doctors had told her that May was her cut-off point for plane travel. The plan was to have her baby in the south of France: everything was organised. But after a couple of days in Cannes – “I partied, I danced, I went to the beach, I swam, dined, met great people” – Kusijanović felt a need to give birth in her own country. “It was a strange emotional push. Like, OK, it’s time to go.” Knowing that she could go into labour at any moment, she drove 13 hours from Cannes to Croatia with her husband and straight to hospital, where she gave birth to her son. Twelve hours later there was a call from the festival – she had won the Camera d’Or prize, for best first feature, would she like to go to the ceremony? “I mean, of course I couldn’t go back to Cannes, no!” Kusijanović says, laughing. But you wouldn’t put it past her. After spending an entertaining hour with Kusijanović, it is clear is that she is a force of nature, no nonsense, outspoken with a fiery and funny sense of humour. She’s speaking over Zoom from Texas, where she’s working on her second film. Nine-month-old Petrus (Cannes bestowed on him a lifetime accreditation in honour of his timely arrival) is napping in the next-door room. Her film Murina is brilliant: executive produced by Martin Scorsese and (mostly) ecstatically reviewed. Variety’s critic compared it to Patricia Highsmith, “if Highsmith had ever written a coming-of-age story set on the rocky, clear-watered Croatian coastline”. Quite rightly, Kusijanović is being hailed as a distinctive new voice in cinema. Kusijanović says she started writing the script before #MeToo, but Murina is a film for our times, about machismo, ego and suffocating masculinity. It’s the story of a 16-year-old girl called Julija (Gracija Filipović), growing up in a sleepy Croatian fishing village with her fisherman dad, Ante (Leon Lučev), and mum, Nela (Danica Curcic). To tourists, their existence looks idyllic. But Ante is a controlling and petulant patriarchal figure who demands total obedience from his wife and daughter. Like a psychological thriller or escape movie, the question is: can Julija break free of her father and the conformist values of her community? What has been fascinating about screening Murina in Croatia, says Kusijanović, is that misogyny is so ingrained that some people miss it as a theme. “They will say: ‘What’s happening in this film? This is a normal family. Nothing really happens.’” Is Ante’s domineering behaviour rationalised by the audience as part of Croatian culture? Kusijanović nods vigorously “Yes! But it’s not culture, it’s not mentality. That’s wrong!” Getting into her stride, she jabs her finger down the screen. “People think it’s normal: it’s our hot Mediterranean blood or whatever. It’s not, it’s just violence. We can passionately sing and cook great fish. That’s mentality. The rest is violence.” It drives her nuts when she’s in Croatia. “I get arrhythmia when I step out of the airport into a cab.” She catches herself and bursts out laughing. “I’m really bad. How is this going to sound?” Kusijanović was born in Dubrovnik, into a family that could not be further from Julija’s in the film. Her mother is a successful art restorer and painter. “I was very lucky to grow up in a family of very strong women. I actually discovered feminism very late. I didn’t know that I need to call myself a feminist because there was just a feminist way of life in our family.” She became a child actor, working from the age of six, mostly in theatre. “I was very extrovert and outgoing. I’d be the one gathering the kids in my street for a theatre show. From the age of five I was directing, actually.” It was also around this time that Kusijanović’s childhood was swept up in the violence of the Balkan war. Her family fled Croatia as refugees in 1991, living overseas for a couple of years, first in Italy, then at a monastery in Austria and, finally, in Germany. “I thought of it as travelling. My mother was really amazing at pulling that off. She really made it feel like a game. I don’t know if I could do that with my son.” When they returned to Dubrovnik, the family’s apartment inside the city walls had been partially destroyed by a grenade. And then there was the trauma; one day Kusijanović’s primary school teacher was concerned enough to call in her mother. “I was writing dark poems. ‘My city is bleeding’ – that was the name of one poem. I was writing a lot about the fight between good and evil.” Terrifyingly, after the war, back in Croatia, Kusijanović had a near-death experience in a landmine explosion. Driving in the mountains on a narrow road with her family, they met an oncoming car. As the two cars nudged past each other, the other car drove on to a mine: “Our front wheel was 10cm from the landmine. The other car blew up in the air and fell on our car. The guy who was driving was decapitated. I was seven. I saw everything.” She says that one day she would like to write a story, something with a fantastical element, of a child’s view of war. How did being a child of war shape her? Kusijanović pauses for a moment, deep in thought. “Since very early years I had a very strong sense of time. I think that’s what formed me most. I don’t think there’s anything worse than not fulfilling your time and your potential. It’s a real sin.” Another long pause. “War is a very stupid thing There’s no good reason to be in a war.” She must be watching the horror in Ukraine very closely, I say. “Yes, of course. It feels awfully familiar.” When she was 27, Kusijanović began a master’s degree in film at Columbia University. The story of how she first picked up a camera sounds like an episode of The Sopranos. A few years before the MA, she decided to make a documentary about a labour dispute between union and non-union construction workers in her New York neighbourhood. It seemed entertaining: one day, someone brought a giant inflatable rat. “It was really fascinating until I scratched too deep.” After being followed by heavies for a few days, things turned nasty. First intimidation: “They said to give up on this story, otherwise I might disappear.” She told them where to stick it. When the threats turned physical, the police advised her to stop her film.That sounds terrifying. She shrugs. “If you don’t fight for something that matters, you should not do anything. I would never just direct a cute story. I don’t have the time. Because, you know, I can die tomorrow.” What she is up for, however, is something on the scale of a superhero movie. Even before I get the question out, she answers: “I wanna do that! If you know someone who’s gonna offer me that, I’m ready to go.” I wouldn’t second guess her.  Murina is released on 8 April. Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović will also take part in Q&As on 8 April at Curzon Bloomsbury, 9 April at Cine Lumiere, and 10 April at the Garden Cinema and Genesis Cinema, in London.",Arts/Film,‘I saw a guy being decapitated when I was seven’: Murina director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/07/i-saw-a-guy-being-decapitated-when-i-was-seven-murina-director-antoneta-alamat-kusijanovic
4/8/2022,"This is the government form that the chancellor’s wife Akshata Murty will have filled in to apply for non-domiciled status in order to avoid paying UK tax on tens of millions in dividends collected from her family’s Indian IT business empire. When it was revealed on Wednesday that Murty was a non-dom, and thereby not required to pay UK tax on about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in Infosys, her spokeswoman said Murty “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes” suggesting that she had no control over her UK tax status. However, all UK residents must actively apply for non-dom status by filing in government tax form SA109 to claim the tax relief. Murty’s spokeswoman suggested that because Murty was an Indian citizen she could not also hold UK citizenship and therefore must be treated as a non-dom for UK tax. Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents’ home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income”. However, several leading international tax experts have disputed this and said tax domicile status is not connected with a person’s nationality. Those resident in the UK do not have to have a British passport in order to pay British taxes, meaning Murty could have paid UK tax at any time. Richard Murphy, a professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and tax justice campaigner, said: “Domicile has nothing to do with a person’s nationality. Nor does it have anything to do with not being able to have a British passport because a person holds citizenship from another country. And non-domiciled status is certainly never given for that reason.” Murphy said non-dom status was given only to people who applied for it. “In that case the implication in Ms Murty’s statement that she has to be treated as non-domiciled is simply wrong. She is only non-domiciled because she asked to be so. “She can also give up the claim to be non-domiciled at any time,” he added. “Just because she was non-domiciled when she arrived in the UK as a newly married person does not mean she has to keep the status now. So the fact she’s still non-dom is also a choice.” Arun Advani, assistant professor at the University of Warwick’s economics department and an expert on non-dom tax law, said: “Citizenship has nothing to do with whether you choose to/not to claim remittance basis in the UK.” Murty’s spokeswoman said she had paid tax on the dividends she collects from her stake in Infosys, which is estimated to be worth about £690m, but has refused to state how much or in which country she paid the tax. Last year she collected dividends of £11.6m. As a higher rate taxpayer she would have been expected to pay a 38.1% tax on the payout, which works out at £4.4m. Sunak has since increased the rate to 39.35%. Many countries do not charge any tax on dividend payments. If Murty collected the dividend in one of these countries it means she could have “paid” all the tax due even if there was no tax to pay. She has previously collected other dividend income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. Robert Palmer, executive director of campaign group Tax Justice UK, said: “Ordinary people who face an increase to their national insurance contributions this week will be shocked to learn that the chancellor’s own wife is a non-dom. This status could potentially save her substantial amounts of tax. “Tax is about political choices. The government should end tax loopholes such as non-dom status and make sure that those who have wealth pay their share.” Murty is understood to have lived in the UK for nine years, and her team have suggested she will “automatically be deemed domiciled after living in the UK for 15 years”. The experts said Murty could choose to be UK domiciled at any point, and is choosing to be non-domiciled by filling in the SA109 form every year. Furthermore, non-domicile people resident in the UK have since 2017 been required to pay an “annual charge” of £30,000 for the rights to the status “if you’ve been here for at least seven of the previous nine tax years”. Her spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about whether Murty pays the levy. Boris Johnson declined to answer questions about Murty on a visit to Somerset this morning, saying: “I think as far as we possibly can in politics it is a good thing to steer clear of wives and families in political discussion.”",News/Politics,Akshata Murty’s non-dom status is a choice not an obligation – tax experts,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/akshata-murty-non-dom-status-rishi-sunak-a-choice-not-an-obligation-tax-experts
