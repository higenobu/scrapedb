1/8/2022,"Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, KG, GCVO, CD, ADC, turns 62 next month. It is long past the age at which a man is expected to stop being a cause of concern and embarrassment to his parents. And yet Andrew, who is said to be the Queen’s favourite child, has exposed his mother to the greatest threat to the royal family’s reputation in living memory. As he awaits the decision of a New York judge, Lewis Kaplan, in the sex assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre, the prince finds himself in the deeply unedifying position of trying to evade court with a secret silencing deal struck by his late friend and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.  The agreement, signed in 2009, stated that in exchange for being paid $500,000, Giuffre, then using her maiden name of Roberts, would “release … and forever discharge … second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia Roberts, including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. Giuffre maintains that in 2001 when she was 17 she was trafficked by Epstein and his sometime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with the prince on three occasions – once in Maxwell’s house in Belgravia, where the infamous photograph was taken of her with the then 42-year-old prince’s hand around her waist, on the second occasion at Epstein’s mansion in New York and finally on Epstein’s private island, Little St James in the US Virgin Islands, with a group of other girls. The prince denies all allegations and says he has no recollection of ever having met Giuffre. The prince’s lawyers have taken an aggressive approach to protecting their client. They first argued that the court summons had not been properly served, then attempted to get the case thrown out on the grounds that Giuffre doesn’t live in the US. Now they are seeking their client’s salvation with the grim fact that he qualifies as a potential defendant in any sex abuse case connected to Epstein. In other words, it appears his possible culpability is being used as his defence. Even if this legal loophole works, and Kaplan dismisses the case, it will be an outcome that will not clear the prince’s name, which his friends insist is his prime aim. Instead, added to all those letters that come after his title, will be a toxic question mark. And that’s the best-case scenario for the prince. If, instead, Kaplan gives the go-ahead for the case to be heard, then the prince would be obliged to make a deposition and then, in the autumn, appear in court. He could in theory refuse to do either, but again the optics would be disastrous. However, if he did go to court, the world’s media would be offered a daily diet of sordid details. And if he were to lose the case, courtiers suggest he may no longer be able to travel internationally, for fear of criminal extradition. As the royal expert and author Robert Lacey puts it: “The prospect of Virginia Giuffre’s allegations against a senior member of the Windsors being aired in court and reported around the world is just impossible to contemplate from the point of view of the royal family, and I’m quite sure there would be some settlement out of court.” Given that Giuffre has waited over 20 years for recognition of the damage that she says was done to her, that settlement would presumably involve a large financial figure – which raises the question of who will pay it. The prince has spent the better part of his adult life cosying up to the super-rich, precisely because he lacks that kind of money himself. So again his mother, who is thought to have bankrolled his defence, would be his benefactor. That brings into the spotlight the contested question of whether her wealth is private or a product of her position as head of state, and therefore subject to some kind of taxpayer oversight. Monarchists insists her private wealth and her public dispensation are completely separate things, but any settlement paid by the Queen would provide republicans with ballistic ammunition. What seems extraordinary is that this conclusion has been moving steadily closer for more than a decade, and the prince, and all those he has repeatedly reassured of his innocence, have been frozen in a state of denial, just hoping that it will all go away. Catherine Mayer, the author of a biography of Prince Charles and co-founder of the Women’s Equality party, says that Buckingham Palace did “something very stupid” when the scandal first surfaced in 2011. Shortly after he was photographed with Epstein in 2010 strolling in Central Park, New York following the American’s release from prison on charges of procuring a minor for prostitution, Andrew was removed from his position as international trade envoy and redeployed on other matters, including as a royal business guru with the Pitch@Palace initiative. Mayer believes that decision was symptomatic of a wish to sidestep the issue rather than confront it. “The whole story is a genuine tragedy because of all the lives it has ruined,” she says. “But there is also a soap opera quality to it in that you see characters ignoring things, of trying to cover them up in the belief that they will make things better, and you, as the viewer, know that they’re going to get worse. I’ve had that feeling watching this.” One problem, says Mayer, is that there has been no comprehensive strategy across the royal family on what to do. Although its members talk about the family as “the firm”, lending the idea of disciplined business entity, this, says Mayer, is a misconception. “It has always been, and increasingly in latter years, not one institution but a series of institutions or courts and households frequently in conflict with each other,” she says. Royal observers note that staff working for Prince Charles and Prince William have briefed against Andrew. A mixture of the Queen’s protectiveness, the wary exasperation of other royal households and Andrew’s stubborn resistance to sound advice, left him to forge his own ad hoc strategy. It resulted in his fateful decision to put his side of the story across in the excruciating November 2019 Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis. As a textbook example of how not to do damage limitation it is unlikely to be surpassed any time soon. “You saw how completely untethered he is to outside reality,” says Mayer. Looking back at that disastrously revealing encounter, it is notable how often the prince used Maxwell to try to put some distance between himself and Epstein (who hosted Andrew on many occasions and gave large sums of money to his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and possessed 16 separate phone numbers for the prince). At one point he describes the financier as a “plus one”. But now that Maxwell herself has been convicted of sex trafficking a minor, among other serious charges, it leaves the prince with no one to saddle with his poor judgment of character. In among a catalogue of evasions and failing memories, his one line of consistent defence is that he was not aware of anything untoward going on in any of the Epstein or Maxwell households at which he stayed. For Lacey, among many other observers, this is simply not a credible proposition. “He consorted for 10 years with a couple whose lifestyle revolved around the sexual exploitation by Epstein of vulnerable women and underage girls, a number of them trafficked by Maxwell. The overtness of this predatory way of life was apparently inescapable. What do you imagine when you travel in a private plane nicknamed the ‘Lolita Express’? And then you invite these degenerates to stay at Balmoral?” When challenged on his apparent blindness by Maitlis, the prince came up with an explanation that Mayer sees as a self-indictment rather than exoneration. He effectively said that he lived among servants all the time and was used to not taking any notice of them – even, presumably, if they were scantily clad teenage girls. “It shows his extraordinary arrogance and disconnection,” says Mayer, “and he unintentionally spoke a truth that is deeply damaging to him and the wider institution.” In fact his brusque manner with servants is well-documented. A senior footman once told a reporter who worked undercover at Buckingham Palace said that on waking the prince “the response can easily be ‘fuck off’ as good morning”. Of course, Andrew would not be the first obnoxious royal, nor the first dissolute prince. The institution’s history is full of badly behaved characters. But we are now living in the third decade of the 21st century, in a time of transition not just for the royal family, as they prepare for the prospect of a new monarch, but society at large. Ten years ago, in the pre-#MeToo days, a movie mogul such as Harvey Weinstein could terrorise and abuse women with impunity. His friend Epstein all but got away with rape and sex trafficking thanks to the political influence he was able to exert. And back in 2011 it may well have seemed that Giuffre’s allegations against Andrew were destined to remain the outlandish cry of an inconsequential person, an unprovable rumour that would fade along with all the other neglected claims made against the rich and powerful. Even a photograph taken inside Maxwell’s home could be dismissed as fake – although how could a young woman get access to an image of the prince that no one else has ever seen to put it in a mocked-up picture? It never did add up, and with the passage of time, the attempt to remove himself from that troubling scene in his friend’s house looks more and more like a desperate tactic. Just as the prince’s claim that he stayed with Epstein for four days to tell him that he could no longer be his friend out of a sense of “honour” was always far-fetched and miserably self-serving. It seems unlikely after all these years that the prince will change his story, and if there is a settlement it will doubtless come with a non-acceptance of any personal responsibility. Yet this is unquestionably a watershed case. It’s hard to imagine that any royal will again be afforded the indulgence that has accompanied Andrew around the globe. Although the monarchy will survive this current crisis, it may well do so in a more streamlined version with fewer passengers. The days of overgrown playboys trading on the family name in exchange for paid-for company and pay-offs to ex-wives should be numbered. And if they are it will be in no small part due to the efforts of a group of women from largely humble backgrounds who refused to back down in the face of their abusers. “I am looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse,” Giuffre said seven years ago. “I’m not going to be bullied back into silence.” As even Prince Andrew would have to concede, she has certainly not allowed that to happen.",News/UK news,Royals await anxiously the fallout from Prince Andrew’s disgrace,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/08/royals-await-anxiously-the-fallout-from-prince-andrews-disgrace
1/8/2022,"Throughout December, clusters of green and yellow symbols began to festoon Twitter feeds like festive decorations. The posts related to a simple, free online word game, Wordle, which has become a must-play trend in the past few weeks, with hundreds of thousands of people proudly sharing their daily score on social media. The game has the elegance of a daily newspaper puzzle – a five-minute conundrum that slots pleasingly into even the most harried routine: guess the five-letter word. You have six attempts. After each attempt the game marks your guess. Letters are marked green if they are present and correctly placed, yellow if they are present but incorrectly placed, and grey if they do not appear in the target word at all. As in the board games Battleship or Mastermind, you can use this meagre information to improve your next guess and close in on the target word. (Infuriatingly, the game offers no indication as to whether a letter appears more than once in the target word, a design choice that inspires howls of online anguish whenever, say, a “TRUSS” appears.)  According to the New York Times, Wordle was created last year by a Brooklyn-based software engineer, Josh Wardle, as a gift for his partner. The game soon became a favourite among his wider family. Then its popularity steadily spread across the internet, from 90 players on 1 November to 300,000 on 2 January. The simplicity is the charm. One Wordle is released each day, and it’s the same one for everyone around the world. There are no advertisements, no niggling notifications begging you to return each morning, no novelty skins with which to alter the appearance of your letters, and no offer coupons in exchange for recommending the game to friends. With so much traffic, the incentive to profit from Wordle’s success is considerable. But the game’s rejection of the capitalistic systems that define so many video games today has a refreshing, innocent quality. Long may Wordle remain so pure.",Arts/Games,Wordle review – simplicity that works like a charm,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/08/wordle-review-josh-wardle-free-word-guessing-game-simplicity-works-like-a-charm
1/8/2022,"Perhaps every generation gets the teen TV show made by adults it needs. In 1991, we had Brandon taking ecstasy at a rave before things went south in Beverly Hills 90210 (lessons were learned). Now we have Euphoria, HBO’s high-school drama with more visceral drugs, sex, violence and trauma (and less learning). Superstar-in-the-making Zendaya is in the lead again.  Elsewhere, Zendaya is reportedly dating her Spider-Man co-star, Tom Holland. The English actor is the son of comedian and author Dominic Holland, who through Eclipsed, his blog/book/stand-up show, charted in self-deprecating (and in no way seething) terms what it’s like to be upstaged by your own child. Holland (Dominic) was nominated for the Perrier award at the Edinburgh fringe in 1996; he lost out to the acerbic surrealism of Dylan Moran. The Irish comic occasionally acts, too. In 2007, he featured in the Simon Pegg vehicle Run Fatboy Run, unexpectedly directed by David Schwimmer. “Disappointing,” declared Peter Bradshaw. Simon Pegg, of course, now has a role as a Tom Cruise sidekick in the Mission: Impossible films. Also in Cruise World is Vanessa Kirby, as the villainous White Widow, first seen in 2018’s Fallout. One fan site describes her character as an “affable arms dealer” – you don’t see a lot of those. Last year Kirby earned an Oscar nomination for her role in harrowing drama Pieces of a Woman (Netflix). Among the producers of Pieces of a Woman was one Sam Levinson. He’s a busy fella: during the pandemic, he knocked out Malcolm & Marie (Netflix), with John David Washington and Zendaya having a domestic row. More pressingly he’s been making … Euphoria, whose long-awaited, Covid-delayed second season is finally upon us (Sky Atlantic/Now TV). Watch In Diner, Sam Levinson’s father, director Barry Levinson, made one of the great films of the 1980s for college-age young people sitting around and talking crap. Eat Zendaya and Holland Jr have been spotted eating in Harlem hot spot Melba’s, which serves up southern classics.

1/8/2022,"When Damien Hirst bought a historic manor in the Cotswolds he had grand plans. The crumbling 19th-century Toddington Manor, which the world’s richest artist bought for £3m in 2005, would be restored to its former glory, turned into his family home and be a spectacular gallery for his personal art collection. But years 17 years after its purchase, the property remains uninhabited and covered in scaffolding and tarpaulin. Locals have branded it an “eyesore,” a “white blob” and “a blight on the countryside”.  Frustrated local residents in Toddington, 10 miles east of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, are now taking matters in their own hands. This week the parish council will meet to come up with a plan that it hopes will force Hirst to finally make good on his promise to restore the property. “We want to see what can be done, if anything at all,” said Toddington parish council’s chairman, Nigel Parker. “It is one of the biggest eyesores in the area. People are fed up with it. Damien Hirst has had this property for 17 years now, but it is still clad in scaffolding and tarpaulin, and as far as we can tell there is no restoration in sight.” Hirst found fame in 1992 when his pickled tiger shark proved to be the centrepiece of the acclaimed Young British Artists exhibition at the Saatchi gallery. A sliced cow and calf, and pickled sheep followed in quick succession, but Hirst’s twin obsession with death and publicity was perhaps best witnessed with his controversial 2007 platinum cast of a human skull encrusted with diamonds, which he claimed sold for £50m Hirst’s work – and the prices it sold for – became synonymous with the new wealth of the late 1990s and 2000s. This reached a climax in September 2008 with the sale of more than 200 of his artworks at Sotheby’s for a total of $200m – on the same day that Lehman Brothers collapsed, sparking a global financial crisis. Hirst bought the sprawling estate in Gloucestershire, which bankrupted the family that built it, for £3m, with locals told that it was destined to be his family home and a spectacular gallery for his personal art collection. But in the wake of his split in 2012 from his long-term partner Maia Norman, the mother of his three sons, the project has stalled, with locals complaining they have been kept in the dark. The property is on Historic England’s “at risk” register and the heritage organisation said it was intending to work with Tewkesbury borough council “to encourage the owner” to press ahead with the restoration. Malle Hague, who lives near the manor, said: “I wish he would bloody well get on with it. It would be nice if he could at least camouflage this white blob. He’s an artist – he could just paint it. “It is a blight on the countryside. This is an area of outstanding natural beauty but you can see this for miles. At the start he did a lot of good work but this has gone on too long now.” Completed in 1840, Toddington Manor took 21 years to construct. It was built by Charles Hanbury-Tracy MP, later Lord Sudeley, and the scale of the undertaking would eventually bankrupt his family in 1893. Composed of a quadrangle and surrounded by cloisters, the house has a large entrance hall, a grand staircase, a 40ft-long oak-panelled dining room, and two libraries, with intricate stone and wood carving. It is one of the earliest examples of what became known as Victorian gothic, and when Sudeley helped to select Charles Barry to rebuild the Houses of Parliament, the architect reportedly took Toddington as one of his models. Councillor John Evetts, chair of Tewkesbury council’s planning committee, said: “It’s been a hell of a long time since he bought it. I am told Hirst has never applied for planning permission. “As the chair of the local planning committee, as far as I am aware he has never spoken to us. I work in restoration and conservation and I think it could cost Damien Hirst £50m to restore and still not be finished. “The talk of the town is that when he [split with his partner] he lost interest in this project. As far as I am aware there have been no further planning approaches or further permissions granted. It appears he has just abandoned it or got bored with it. It is the biggest white elephant I have ever seen. In fact ‘folly’ would be a good word.” Bert Alvis, a local farmer and parish councillor, complained that his repeated inquiries with the estate management company have failed to illicit any answers. “I have asked the agent, which manages the estate, and they have no idea. We heard he was going to use it as a private house and private gallery for his collection,” he said. “But after the crash, everything stopped. It is odd: no one is telling anybody anything.” Last year it was revealed that Hirst, who is reportedly worth £315m, had taken out £15m in Covid loans and furloughed staff at the taxpayers’ expense. Although his main company, Prints and Editions, has £188m of art on its books, it has failed to turn a profit since 2016, and Hirst has closed many of his companies in the last four years. In 2018 it was revealed that Hirst was closing down his high-profile restaurant in Ilfracombe, Devon, just a year after he had shut his gallery in the town. This was billed as part of a restructuring of his sprawling Science Ltd empire but also drew local criticism that the artist had left some properties vacant.Hirst has built up a formidable property portfolio since he exploded on to the British art scene. Toddington Manor, however, was meant to be his piece de resistance. A Tewkesbury council spokesman said it was “satisfied there are intentions to repair it”. But he added that there were no current planning application listed and “we are not aware of any work that has taken place”. Parker, chair of the parish council, said: “After the meeting we may write to Damien Hirst and his representatives, or it may be that Tewkesbury will. But, either way, it is time this was resolved.”",Arts/Art and design,"First, a pickled shark.

1/8/2022,"Housing campaigners and MPs have cautiously welcomed plans to pressure developers to cover the cost of removing dangerous cladding from buildings taller than 11 metres, but warned they do not go far enough. In an apparent climbdown, the housing secretary Michael Gove is expected to announce that leaseholders in buildings between 11 and 18 metres (36-60ft) tall will no longer have to take out loans to cover costs. Instead, Gove will try to make developers pay £4bn, according to a leaked Treasury letter reported by BBC Newsnight.  Under rules introduced in England after the Grenfell Tower fire killed 72 people in 2017, only leaseholders in buildings of more than 18 metres can access grants to replace unsafe cladding. However, excitement will be tempered as the Treasury letter that states approval for funding applies only to fixing cladding. That means leaseholders who are facing bills for defective fire compartmentation, fire doors and other non-cladding faults still face bills and uncertainty over whether mortgage companies will lend against their homes so they are sellable. Also, there is no new money. The £4bn may all come from existing housing department budgets, according to the letter. In addition, it only threatens a tax on developers or legal action – both of which have been largely unsuccessful in getting developers to pay to fix defective buildings so far. Giles Grover, the co-leader of the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign, said it was “another step in the right direction” but that they needed to see the detail as well as action on the ground. “You can talk about extra funding and positive steps but it’s taking so long to make the buildings safe.” He also called for legal protection for leaseholders. “We need legislation to protect us, that’s how we’ll get certainty.” Grover said his group was meeting Gove on Monday morning when he said they would “see what he has to say”. He said that in Gove’s short time in the role he had done considerably more than his predecessor Robert Jenrick, but warned: “Still we need to see the money on the ground getting out.” Another campaign spokesperson, Paul Afshar, said he welcomed the news but said the “devil’s in the detail”. “Obviously it’s welcome news. I myself live in a building that’s under 18 metres and previously there was nothing in place in terms of financial support … I’m cautiously optimistic about it. We need to see the exact detail on it in terms of the scope of what it’s going to cover and how much money is going to be put aside.” Steph Pike, a lawyer, leaseholder and campaigner, tweeted: “This is another announcement with no real substance. How is Gove going to ‘make developers pay’ without legislating for it? What about non-cladding fire safety defects? Who pays for them? More spin. More words. No real action.” The leaked letter to Gove, from chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, said loans for smaller buildings would be replaced by a “limited grant scheme”. “You may use a high-level ‘threat’ of tax or legal solutions in discussions with developers as a means to obtaining voluntary contributions from them,” it read. “I am pleased to see that you acknowledge the principle that the taxpayer should not be on the hook for further costs of remediation. To reiterate, my approval of this new package for 11-18m buildings is therefore conditional on no further Exchequer funding.” Peter Bottomley, a senior Conservative MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold reform, urged the government to go further.“From what we’re hearing, progress is being made – it’s not enough,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“We need to get the money, spend it properly, and we need to overcome the hurdle” of indemnity funding so landlords can make claims from developers and manufacturers, he said. The government must tell insurance companies to “come to the table with, say, £8bn and then innocent leaseholders will live in homes which are safe and saleable”. Matthew Pennycook, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: “Any new measures that help resolve the building safety crisis are welcome, but on the face of it these appear far less significant than they sound. “Nothing on non-cladding defects, no new developer levy and the position on leaseholder liability unchanged. We await further detail.” An announcement on the measures is expected on Monday. A department for levelling up, housing and communities spokesperson said: “We would not comment on speculation.”",News/Society,Flat owners and campaigners give cautious welcome to cladding climbdown,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/08/flat-owners-and-campaigners-give-cautious-welcome-to-cladding-climbdown
