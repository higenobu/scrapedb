3/6/2022,"The worst people in the west were pro-Putin. They excused his imperialist ideology and crimes against humanity and never paid a price for bootlicking a dictatorship. On the contrary, they took Britain out of the European Union and took over the Labour party. They won the presidencies of the United States and the Czech Republic and seized control of politics and the media in Hungary. The savagery of Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukrainian democracy has sent them into headlong retreat. Nothing better illustrates their panic than Marine Le Pen having to deny that she had ordered the destruction of 1.2m election leaflets that featured pictures of her giving Putin a firm handshake, as if to thank him for all the money he had loaned her. Another French far right leader, Éric Zemmour, announced his affinity with the fascist tradition by defending Vichy’s collaboration with the Nazis and the persecutors of Albert Dreyfus. With the first round of the French presidential election opening on 10 April, he returned the support the Kremlin has given him by saying that the French should not treat Putin’s victims as refugees because they would “submerge” France under a wave of immigration. Cheeringly, Zemmour’s image of Ukrainians pushing French heads under water, as if they were aggressors rather than victims, did nothing to stop the decline in his support. In Hungary, the victory of the Putin wannabe Viktor Orbán in the elections on 3 April no longer seems the certainty it once was. In the UK, the Labour leadership ordered MPs from the rump of the Corbyn left to disassociate themselves from a letter blaming Putin’s war on Nato or lose the whip. Even Donald Trump and Nigel Farage are backing away from Putin now and when rats that size abandon ship we know we are in uncharted waters. Writers have struggled to find a label for the movements that have transformed the west. “Populist” is too vague. “Nationalist” works well until you remember that they hate large numbers of their fellow citizens and are more than willing to ally with their nations’ enemies. “Racist”? Certainly in some cases but how does that oft-repeated insult cover the religious sectarianism of a Modi or Erdoğan? “Fascist?” In the rhetorical echoes and common heritage, of course, but not in goose-stepping fact. But they have all been “Putinist”, and not only because they have flattered the Kremlin. The appeal of the Russian empire to parts of the far left remains both a cause of outrage and a pitiable demonstration of moral and intellectual decay. From Karl Marx to Oscar Wilde, every 19th-century liberal and socialist knew imperial Russia was the greatest fortress of European reaction. (Wilde was so moved by the struggle against it he wrote Vera; or, The Nihilists, a forgotten and truly terrible play to honour an attempt to assassinate the tsarist governor of St Petersburg.) The appeal of Putin’s revival of tsarism to the modern far right may be grotesque but at least it makes sense. Putin is anti-democratic and so are they, as Orbán’s quasi-dictatorship and Trump’s attempts to overturn elections show. Putin despises human rights and so do they. Putin trades on a dark nostalgia and so do they. Above all, Putin is a strongman and it is as the tough guys who make their countries great again through a sheer act of will that they have sold themselves to tens of millions of voters. Did I call them the “far right”? Forgive me, for “far right” doesn’t quite cover it. As I said, the Labour mainstream used the invasion to move against the tyrannophile left. We have seen nothing comparable on the supposedly mainstream right. No pieces in the Mail or Telegraph agonising over how they ever came to be fooled by Farage and Arron Banks. No speeches from Boris Johnson warning against the seductions of tyrannical thinking and power worship. The silence shows that the border between the centre right and the far right has fallen into disrepair. For Johnson also likes to pose as a strongman, who can get Brexit done. He too wallows in nostalgia for the past rather than hope for the future and defines himself against a large portion of his fellow countrymen: the remoaners, the naysayers, the libtards and the woke. In the most desperate of circumstances, Ukraine cries to be allowed into the European Union, that same European Union a generation of unforgivably trivial Tories have dedicated their lives to destroying. Putin shows his fear of Russians learning the truth about his war by blocking their access to the BBC, the same BBC that Johnson underfunds and promises to ruin whenever he needs to toss red meat to the Tory right. Predicting anything in this hellish week is a fool’s endeavour but of one thing I am sure: Putin has destroyed the appeal of strongman politics in the 2020s as effectively as Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin did in the 1930s. The career of Volodymyr Zelenskiy explains why. He has not played the Putinist game of divide and rule or created a personality cult. At his inauguration, he asked government workers to end the Soviet practice of putting pictures of the ruler on their office wall. “Hang your kids’ photos instead and look at them each time you are making a decision,” he said. Just before Putin’s forces attacked, Zelenskiy appealed to Russians in their own language to reject Putin and emphasised his determination to protect Russian minorities in Ukraine. The broad appeal of his leadership helped create the broad resistance to invasion. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, told me there was nothing soppy about leaders doing all in their power to seek national unity. A nation’s resilience depends on governments seeking to avoid needless dividing lines. “We must unite the country in peacetime so we can defend ourselves in an emergency.” We are now in an economic war that will send fuel and food prices ever higher. The poorest will hurt the most and in the name of national unity they deserve emergency help. Worse may be on the way than inflation and recession. As things stand, the most fitting epitaph to the Trumps, Farages and Le Pens who prostrated themselves before Putin is that if economic war is all he brings down on us, we can count ourselves lucky.

3/6/2022,"Lismore vet Nick Jones can reel off the equipment he lost when his surgery was flooded with clinical precision – X-ray, X-ray processor, ultrasound, computers, telephone system, solar panel inverters – but when asked if he planned to reopen, he falters and his eyes seem to water. A second later his resolve is back, “Of course, there is no question of that.” Jones, family members and friends have been on the ground cleaning the clinic building. He has owned it for 22 years. His father, also a vet, owned it for the 30 years before that. “1974 was the main flood but still nothing like this, and in 2017 the water came into the bottom storey almost to the second flood,” he says. “This time it came 30 or 40cm from the roof.” Was he insured? “We were for 2017, but certainly not this time … it’s just not a proposition. Insurance, as it is, it’s just too expensive.” Jones estimates his business losses at between $150,000 to $250,000. The good news? No animals drowned, not even the two resident clinic cats. They were taken home by a veterinary nurse. There are photos of animals separated from their owners by the flood waters on community northern rivers Facebook pages. The pets are in shelters or private homes waiting to be claimed. On Tuesday, standing on the edge of the flood water, I watched a woman aged around 70 ask a police diver to check on her two cats in her inundated home. He obliged. There was no good news. Her reaction wasn’t emotional, maybe she was in shock, but she thanked the officer for checking and left holding her daughter’s arm. Lismore is “getting on” with the cleanup. The Mud Army is out in force, ripping up furnishings, carrying out damaged chairs, tables, desks, hosing mud off, but yesterday I also saw a woman, dressed in overalls in the CBD, sobbing against a car. She was with people. They gave her space to cry. I have lived in the northern rivers for 15 years. For this story I asked more than a dozen people for an interview, and with every request I cautioned them against speaking if it would upset them. I do this because I live in this community with these people. “How can anything upset me after this?” laughs Ken Matheson, a Lismore resident aged 65 years who lost all his possessions on Sunday night. We speak in the garden of his home as his grown-up children and grandchildren carry his ruined furniture to the curb. When I question him where he went when it became clear his house would flood, he runs out of words and looks away. We stand together under a blue sky in silence – the morning’s rain has cleared. I don’t want him to feel distressed so joke about his industrious family. Even though his house has never before had water through it, he couldn’t get flood insurance, explaining “no one will do it, no one would give it to me”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Lismore post-flood has a smell that has elements of rotten fruit, lawn clippings, urine and mud. There’s about 10cm of slippery ground sludge that is as dark and thick as melted chocolate – but with that smell. In some parts of the town, the force of water has torn up pavers. Towers of rubbish dot the footpath and Mud Army volunteers are hurriedly, almost feverishly, building those mounds (some almost two metres) ever higher tossing on everything you can imagine – curtains, carpets, furniture, toys, clothes, shoes, china. “It’s worse than 2017” has become a greeting, almost a salute. On the ground also are police, ambulance officers and units from the Rural Fire Service with their high-pressure hoses. Everyone is busy, everyone has a purpose. Still, occasionally, someone will spring a leak and allow themselves tears. I visited an evacuation centre. To protect the privacy and dignity of the evacuees, the media are banned. I was there, as a local, dropping off food. I can’t tell you what I saw. When I got back to my car, I allowed myself a cry. It’s not my first. Even people whose homes weren’t hit by the floods are frenetic – baking for evacuee friends, sourcing food for the centres, cleaning mud-caked properties. It’s as though we must make amends because our properties are still intact. Survivor guilt. The supermarket shelves were stripped bare, the roads north and south cut. Daryl Spriggs, the minister of the Lismore Presbyterian Church, helped source supplies for the evacuation centres. “Butchers have been donating sausages, rissoles, steaks – and egg and bacon for our food van to keep people fed,” he says. Spriggs is also cleaning his water-damaged church with volunteers and providing pastoral care to his congregation. He began the role in Lismore four weeks ago. “It’s sort of late nights and early starts with disrupted sleep, but I guess I’m confident in a sovereign God even in the midst of this,” he says. Manoeuvring between summits of rubbish, people in Lismore seem to be trying to find their way – literally and metaphorically. “I was planning to retire this year,” says Alex Coronakes, the owner of Lismore’s Tropicana fruit shop. Now he is unsure of this future. He has run the shop for 39 years and his father ran it before him. He can’t remember how many times it was flooded but gestures to the 1974 and 2017 high water mark in his doorway. “This time it was way up there,” he says, pointing straight up. “It touched the ceiling. I reckon there was six metres of water in this shop.” Being an old hand at floods he removed his produce on Saturday. As a regional journalist based in northern New South Wales, I am on the frontline of climate change, on the frontline of what seems to be a human war against the environment. I reported on the 2011 Brisbane floods, the 2017 Lismore flood and the Black Summer bushfires of 2019/20. Reporting for the Guardian on the bushfires, I asked Scott Morrison what he was doing about climate change to stop this happening again and again, explaining that fire evacuees wanted to know. Gladys Berejiklian’s response was: “Honestly, not today.” I know that soon a senior federal cabinet minister will arrive (wearing chinos and a checked shirt) and tour the devastation with news crews in tow. The politician will say how resilient and hardy regional people are, how we have great community spirit, but won’t talk about climate change – or how these floods are different, or how we are going to prepare for a future in which these events are more frequent. Frank Cooper, who also lost all his possessions in the Lismore floods, was reluctant to be interviewed by me at first because he says other people have been harder hit and are more deserving of having their story heard. He has lived in his house for 35 years and it has never previously flooded. He didn’t have flood insurance because no one would sell it to him. He and his wife are staying with his sister in a one-bedroom house. “It’s a day-by-day proposition,” Cooper says. “We have some savings, but I also lost my job too because my workplace … has gone all the way under. I might be out of work for months. I don’t know what I’m going to do.” Yes, regional people are resilient, but our communities deserve better than platitudes. We need real change.",News/Australia news,‘Worse than 2017’: Lismore faces mammoth rebuild after flood as community inundated by loss,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/06/worse-than-2017-lismore-faces-mammoth-rebuild-after-flood-as-community-inundated-by-loss
3/6/2022,"When most New Zealanders hear the term “marae” they think of the typical Māori meeting house. The angular facade, decorated in red and white carvings, and the open space for the “encounter” where guests arrive in the warmth of welcome, in the grief of a tangi (funeral), or in the uncertainty of a disagreement. Technically, the “marae” refers to that open space, but most people assume it means the meeting house. In most parts of the North Island, marae – taking the common meaning of the meeting house and the open space – dot small, rural communities. In Te Teko, where I trace my whakapapa (ancestry), there are four marae within a couple kilometres of each other. Each marae on that golden mile in Te Teko acts as a physical statement – this is Māori land. Marae embody deep connections to the land and to the ancestors who exercised rights and responsibilities in respect of it. They make perfect sense in New Zealand. But in Australia, where the Sydney Marae Alliance are preparing to construct that country’s first marae, they make no sense. In a landmark deal the Alliance are planning a $4m facility in Greystanes, a suburb in western Sydney. For the 65,000 Māori who call New South Wales home the soon-to-be marae will act as a tangible connection to their ancestral home, creating a space for Māori culture to thrive on a foreign land. “Foreign” is the operative word, though. Marae are a statement of indigeneity. In Te Teko, the marae on the golden mile signal a deeper, longer connection to the land than the Pākehā farms and towns that surround them. But in Australia Māori aren’t indigenous. Māori are indigenous to New Zealand. And that distinction is at the heart of the matter. In Australia, Aboriginal peoples are Indigenous. In Greystanes, the Darug are the people who maintain an ancient connection to the land and exercise their rights and responsibilities in respect of it. In the more than 60,000-year history of Aboriginal peoples, Māori – arriving in Sydney shortly after white settlement – are Johnnies-come-lately. Can the Māori community in NSW really call on a connection deep enough to justify a marae? The Alliance point to the 19th-century farm that one rangatira (Māori chief) maintained in the area as well as the Reverend Samuel Marsden’s former seminary for Māori only eight kilometres from the proposed site. There are Māori ancestors buried in and around what is, today, western Sydney. But on that logic we could also rationalise the monuments to European imperialism – from statues to churches to prisons – on the basis that white settlers can point to a few hundred years in Australia as well. None of this is enough to make Māori or Europeans indigenous to Australia because Indigenous people already exist. Building a marae would form part of a grim history of erasing Aboriginal indigeneity. None of this is to suggest the Alliance is acting in bad faith. The facility in Greystanes forms one part of several proposals to construct marae in Australia. In 2010 a proposal was made for a marae in Melbourne, and then one for Western Australia in 2013. Māori in Australia obviously yearn for a space where they can just be Māori. But the answer to that yearning is rather obvious – if you want a marae, return to New Zealand. If you want a space to be Māori, build a community centre or lease a hall. The carvings that decorate marae are another statement of belonging, telling the story of an indigenous people and their connection to the land in question. But whose stories will the carvings in Greystanes tell? The Alliance confirm that they’ve sought and won support from Darug elders for their marae. Again, this indicates the good faith in which the proposal was created, but it still doesn’t address the “indigenous” question. Mamari Stephens illustrates this well when recounting the opening ceremony for a pou – a carving that communicates a certain meaning, in this context a welcome and connection to New Zealand – in the south Pacific garden in the Nurragingy Reserve where (quite wrongly) Māori took on the role of welcoming the visitors. That might seem harmless, but the visitors appeared to include members of the Darug community. In this context Māori can never be indigenous, and so they should never take on the traditional (in New Zealand) role of welcoming the actual Indigenous people – the Darug – in a powhiri on to their own land.

3/6/2022,"For a supposedly great and mighty ruler, Tsar Dodon seems a little lost. Once known for his ruthless war-making, we find him in a funk: his armour doesn’t fit any more, his shield is rusted. He stumbles around a kingdom of grey dirt and tall grass, rattling his sabre and wearing a singlet caked in grease and grime. Even from the back of Adelaide’s Festival Theatre stalls, you can almost sense the Cheeto dust down his front. His two heirs jostle for his favour and greedily eye his crown, played by Samuel Dundas and Nicholas Jones as corporate fail-sons in slick business suits. As has become his signature, the Berlin-based Australian director Barrie Kosky has uprooted Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov’s 1907 opera from its Russian folkloric setting, and goes wherever his sense of macabre whimsy takes us. Kosky’s knack for the playful and absurd announces itself when we meet the soldiers and generals in Dodon’s orbit. Recalling the giant schnozzes of his 2016 mounting of Shostakovich’s The Nose, Kosky depicts this compliant machinery of war as a pack of giant horse heads, bobbing on stockinged legs and cantering comically around the stage. They quiver with fear and nod along to their monarch’s whims. “Fools, yes we are,” they echo in agreement, after invoking Dodon’s scorn. Dodon is convinced that foreign invaders amass at his borders, and loses sleep plotting pre-emptive action. He is visited by a bearded, loftily-voiced Astrologer (Andrei Popov), who brings the perfect gift for a paranoid king who has it all: a golden cockerel that will warn him of danger. From its perch atop the dead tree that looms over the stage, the man-sized cockerel is a featherless, gold-smeared, Guillermo del Toro-worthy goblin-bird (Matthew Whittet). Its heraldic warning call, sung offstage by soprano Samantha Clarke, only serves to raise the tsar’s stress levels. Soon, the princes are sent off to war. Completed shortly before his death, Rimsky-Korsakov’s final work arrived in the wake of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905. Now, 113 years after its premiere in 1909, Kosky’s interpretation marks its first ever performance in Australia after premiering at France’s Festival d’Aix-en-Provence in 2021. As far as century-old commentaries on Russian autocracy and doomed foreign policy go, it could hardly have arrived at a more pointed moment, performed by a European and Australian cast that includes both Russian and Ukrainian performers. The tsar himself is played by British Ukrainian bass-baritone Pavlo Hunka, who this week has been vocal in his condemnation of that other Russian autocrat. But this fairytale, based on an 1834 poem by Alexander Pushkin, moves beyond surface-level geopolitical parallels. When Dodon ventures out to learn of his sons’ war efforts, he crosses paths with the Queen of Chemakha (Venera Gimadieva), a foreign tsaritsa with designs on his kingdom. She’s played like a seductive old Hollywood starlet, dress fringed with long sparkling tassels and backed by four dazzling male courtiers who dance and strut around her. As Dodon grows besotted by her beguiling movements, the ageing patriarch channels his insecurity into the leering pursuit of the young and virginal. But the tsaritsa plays to his vanity, entitlement and desire, and soon he’s willing to do just about anything to win her – he begrudgingly sings for her, and even tries, humiliatingly, to learn to dance for her. It looks like the feared tsar might end up surrendering for love, rather than war. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Ever since his fabled stint as Adelaide festival’s youngest-ever director back in 1996, Kosky’s name has been whispered around town with reverence and glee. Current festival co-directors Rachel Healy and Neil Armfield have wisely made him a key plank of their tenure, first with 2017’s Saul and then The Magic Flute in 2019. The Golden Cockerel is a different beast, and only for a few moments does it approach the kind of colourful, ensemble spectacle that seared Saul into audiences’ memories. (It does, however, share its appreciation for a good decapitated prop head). But this is a funny, pathos-laden production, full of weirdly satisfying surprises. Rimsky-Korsakov’s final score is a dizzying parting gift to the vocalists of the world, but the principal cast are in fine form with the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra underneath them. After the initial bombast of all the king’s horses and his douchebag sons, it’s Gimadieva and Hunka’s strange courtship that gives The Golden Cockerel its hypnotic energy, as we watch the tsar and tsaritsa pit youth, beauty and ambition against age and hubris. And like any good fable, the cockerel inevitably comes home to roost – and Kosky doesn’t disappoint.

3/6/2022,"With Russia invading Ukraine, its president, Vladimir Putin, has been painted by many in the western media as the most evil man in the world. Commentators are asserting that this premeditated act is evil. I do not disagree. To see a war in Europe nearly 80 years after the end of the second world war is unthinkable. What other words describe such violence and the man who singlehandedly has authorised this assault? Now that Putin has twice raised the chilling proposition of nuclear weapons – referring to Russia as “one of the most powerful nuclear states” and later ordering that nuclear forces be placed on “special alert” – the global images of a trip wire to nuclear armageddon are disturbing our equanimity. What other word but evil captures this? In contemplating this I think there has been a missing dimension in naming Putin’s messianic and religious pretensions. And as a minister of the gospel, this perspective has caused me deep heartache. At a personal level I have been required to reflect on my memories of the man and whether I sensed I was in the presence of evil. Back in 2013 I had a meeting with Putin in his dacha two hours out of Moscow. It went for over an hour and half. He was courteous and inquisitive and even agreed to some of the requests we were making. I and the delegation of three others came away thinking he could be reasonable. None of us thought him evil. But now I wonder? The occasion then was the G20 when Russia had the presidency and Putin was the first leader to invite civil society leaders to meet and participate at the highest level and enjoy an equal access and platform with the business G20. I was leading the Australian delegation and we urged him to stop beating up Russian NGOs and to widen the space for civil society dissension and debate. Amazingly he did not disagree. As I think back there were some interesting clues. We waited in an ante room for the meeting under a picture of the first Crimean war. All I knew about that was the story of Florence Nightingale, not why it was fought and even who won. Putin’s aide told us that the 1853-56 war was personal for Putin and Russians remembered it as if it was just yesterday. Christian Russia had been shocked that the Christian west had sided with Muslim Turks and defeated them. I thought of this later when in 2014 Putin annexed Crimea and rode roughshod over sovereign Ukrainian territory. In our meeting with Putin, he said that he was insistent that young Russians start going back to church. He wore a cross around his neck and I later learned he had been secretly baptised by his mother as his father was an atheist. He seemed fascinated that I was a reverend and questioned me about faith. I pushed the envelope and raised why he had sentenced Pussy Riot for singing in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow and he said the church had been deeply offended. I said but a church, despite its offence, believes in the primacy of forgiveness not punishment for a blasphemy, and he looked at me with blinking incomprehension as if to say why would they forgive? But did I sense I was in the presence of evil? No. We have heard a lot of ranting from Putin about the threat to Russia from Nato encirclement and justifications for the invasion to denazify Ukraine and stop their genocide of Russians. This is all propaganda and nonsense. What has been missed is the religious dimension in Putin’s thinking, although in delegitimising Ukraine, he did refer to it as an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space. This spiritual space is an important clue often overlooked. In 988 Vladimir king of the Rus was the first Christian convert. In Kyiv he summoned the whole city to the banks of the Dnieper River for a mass baptism. Holy Mother Russia was born. In 2019 the Ukrainian church broke with the Russian church and declared its independence. But Putin and the Russian church will not accept this because it is the site of the imagined mother church for all the Rus. I was encouraged to read that some 176 Russian Orthodox priests a few days ago had signed an open letter condemning the war. This is a small crack in Putin’s complete capture of the church within Russia. Such signs of dissent point to a recovery of the Gospel of peace and transcends the Rus religious tribe. Despite the Bolshevik years, this sense of a holy destiny of Kyiv and Mother Russia has never left and Putin is its champion. Under Putin the Orthodox church has boasted that it is building and opening three churches a day, and the church celebrated the return of Crimea. Little wonder the Orthodox Patriarch Kirill a decade ago called Putin “a miracle of God”. And in Putin’s mind it goes further. Just as he probed me about Christianity in the west, he reportedly said in a speech in 2013: “We see many of the Euro-Atlantic countries are actually rejecting their roots, including the Christian values that constitute the basis of western civilisation. They are denying the moral principles and all traditional identities: national, cultural, religious and even sexual.” Kyiv must be taken, in his mind, to preserve the Christian battle. And there may be many Christians in the west who agree with some of his sentiments. A miracle defender of Christianity or the most evil man? Well, it is Ukrainian Christians among others whom he is now slaughtering indiscriminately and he has little understanding of Jesus, who said “blessed are the peacemakers”. No, this is a power vision threaded through with nationalistic Christian theology. And evil is the right word when a leader uses religion to justify in God’s name invasion, violence and annihilation.

3/6/2022,"There are plenty of reasons to take up hiking holidays, from getting some fresh air and exercise to untethering yourself from your devices. Done right, it can be a joyful and liberating experience, but embarking on your first multi-day hike is daunting. Putting in the effort to be well prepared will become worthwhile on the trail as you disconnect and let your mind wander. Simply wake up and eat, and start walking when you’re ready. Knowing you’ve already made most of the important decisions, you’re free to just enjoy the experience. Some of Australia’s famous bushwalking trails only allow a limited number of hikers each day and they can book out quickly, so it’s worth thinking about where you want to go (and when) well in advance. When deciding which hike to tackle, look at the skill level required. Grades 3 and 4 (moderate and moderate-difficult) generally hit the sweet spot of taking you away from the crowds without being too arduous. In terms of transport, circuit hikes make access easy, while most one-way trails require a bit more planning. Either take two cars and leave one at the finishing point, or look for companies offering transfers at more popular trails – on longer bushwalks, they can often organise food drops as well. Before you set off, let someone know when you’re leaving and when to expect you back, in case anything goes wrong. Companies offering guided hikes can do most of this work for you, as well as organising gear. They can be an excellent option for anyone unable to carry a full pack, or struggling to put a group together, but charge handsomely for the privilege. “There’s no such thing as bad weather,” goes the age-old hiking aphorism, “Only bad gear.” Prepare well, and you’ll be ready for any scenario. It’s easy to spend a fortune on equipment – everything from cutlery to tents can be upgraded – but unless you’re planning a lengthy unsupported trip, middle-of-the-range gear will suffice in most cases. Start with a modest hike that allows you to test everything out, then buy fancier kit as needed. Every hike has different needs and you should always pack for your destination, but some items will make any walk more enjoyable. Chief among these are good shoes and a decent pack. In both cases, comfort is vital and shopping in store is far safer than going online – independent stores, in particular, often have incredibly knowledgable and enthusiastic staff. Try on multiple pairs of boots and walk around the store (including up and down steps if possible) to make sure they feel comfortable. Similarly, try on a few packs and don’t be shy about asking a staff member to adjust them to your body shape. A good pack should last more than a decade, so take your time. Almost every multi-day hike will require you to camp out, and a good sleep is vital to enjoying the experience. When choosing a sleeping bag, you’ll have to prioritise warmth, weight or cost. Fortunately there are plenty of cheaper options suitable for most Australian conditions (look at the “comfort” rather than “lower limit” or “extreme” temperature ratings). Sleeping mats and even pillows provide extra comfort. A tent is one of the heaviest pieces of essential equipment, but sharing one tent between hikers significantly reduces the weight you each need to carry and the set-up time once you arrive at camp. When it comes to clothing, avoid cotton in favour of wool or synthetic fabrics that dry quickly, and make sure to bring plenty of layers – this is the best way to prepare for many situations without overloading. Don’t be afraid to wear clothes several days in a row, but keeping a set of fresh clothes for camp can be a game changer after a long day. Food can be a serious contributor to weight, especially on longer hikes. Pack compact snacks with low water content – dried fruit and nuts are excellent – and follow the same theme for meals. Hiking stores are full of expensive dehydrated meals but you can easily prepare your own at home or go for cheap options like two-minute noodles. Just remember to avoid glass, tins or other heavy packaging. When cooking, gas stoves are typically easier to operate and lighter than spirit stoves. As well as comfort, safety is an important concern. You should always have at least one first-aid kit in your group, a map and compass (and the ability to use them), and if you’re in a remote area, it’s worth thinking about hiring an EPIRB emergency beacon. Most hikes require at least a moderate level of fitness, and the best way to prepare is simply to walk wherever possible. This also lets you break your shoes in so they won’t give you blisters. Test out the rest of your gear before you hit the trail as well; go for a day walk with your pack, learn to set up and pack down your tent in the back yard and use everything you’re planning to bring with you at least once so you iron out any issues in advance. Replacing equipment is near impossible once you’re walking, so being prepared is essential. Just as vital is finding a good pace. Don’t push yourself too hard, because it’s meant to be fun. Six hours of walking each day is a good amount to aim for. Your pack will probably will feel uncomfortably heavy at times, but one of the joys of multi-day hiking is that it gets easier as your fitness improves and you reduce weight as you go by eating food. Water is an important consideration. Many Australian hikers drink water straight from rainwater tanks and creeks, but if you’re concerned about safety, bring something to treat the water with. Carrying three litres of drinking water a day is a good rule of thumb, plus extra to cook with if there is no water available at the next camp site. Most popular hikes have composting toilets that can be smelly but are very convenient. If you need to go in the middle of the day, make sure to bury any waste at least 15cm deep with a trowel, away from any running water, so you don’t spoil the landscape. In a group, splitting up meals so each person cooks one night is a great way to ensure variety and a communal atmosphere, leaving plenty of time to enjoy the sunsets and starry night skies. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself feeling tired much earlier than usual – in the absence of electricity you’ll naturally grow sleepy as soon as it’s dark (and maybe before).

3/6/2022,"An army crane pulls concrete breeze blocks into the middle of the road. A group of youths empty shovel-loads of sand into sacks to make sandbags. Middle-aged men leave their families for long shifts out in the cold. Over the past week, these makeshift armed positions have sprung up with increasing speed on both major and minor roads on the routes into Kyiv. The Ukrainian capital is now a fortress, at least partly defended by a volunteer army of local people. After the first few days of shock when Putin’s war began, an overwhelming effort is now under way to prepare as best as possible for a potential Russian drive to the heart of the Ukrainian state. Emptied of many civilians and fortified with these amateur barricades, Kyiv waits for the Russians. “We understand that these posts won’t stop a tank, but they are about finding Russian saboteurs and preserving order,” said a 58-year-old army chaplain, who is running the defence preparations for an area on the outskirts of Kyiv. He sat in a boxy office at a local administration building dressed in khaki fatigues, his Kalashnikov leaning against the radiator. He had plotted out the location of checkpoints in his small district to create a network of defences that, he hoped, would be impossible to circumvent. Local officials contacted teachers and managers to do cursory checks on those volunteering to receive a gun and guard the posts. “We work with them, we train them, almost everyone is local. Everyone knows each other. If we hear that someone is not very reliable, then we give them a task without weapons,” he said. Along the highway from the south to Kyiv, the only route into the capital that for now remains relatively safe, billboards displaying stock images of happy families advertising new apartments or holiday destinations appear like messages from a parallel universe. Others have been hastily replaced with posters bearing the words: “Russian ship, fuck off!” These were the words allegedly spoken by the defenders of Snake Island in the Black Sea to a Russian ship that threatened to open fire if they did not surrender. Initial reports that all the defenders had been killed were later denied, and the audio exchange has not been verified, but the encounter had already attained legendary status and the phrase has become the unofficial slogan of Ukraine’s war effort. Other messages on huge digital displays in central Kyiv are more subtle, asking Russian soldiers if they want to die for Putin’s oligarchs, or imploring them to return home with a clean conscience. Whether or not any Russian soldiers will make it into Kyiv in the coming days to see them remains questionable. The Polish ambassador, Bartosz Cichocki, the last remaining EU ambassador in Kyiv, described the city as “uninvadable and unconquerable” in a meeting this week inside his embassy, where he has hunkered down with whisky, cigarettes and a flak jacket. But after the initial attempts to seize the capital speedily, there are now fears that Russia may do what it has done in cities such as Kharkiv and Chernihiv and bring in airstrikes against civilian targets. Kyiv, which just a fortnight ago was a bustling European metropolis, is now eerily deserted. The only sounds in the centre are the ringing of church bells and the wail of the air raid sirens, which sound a few times a day. Occasionally, a police car or military vehicle speeds past, daubed with yellow paint or marked with yellow tape, the sign of Ukrainian forces. In contrast to the silent streets, the train station is a maelstrom of chaotic activity. Inside the cavernous central hall, a grand Soviet structure filled with mosaics, mirrors and two multi-tiered chandeliers, a crush of people waited to get to the platforms. Ukrainian railways has evacuated more than a million people since the war began, and for trains going west, no tickets are required, just patience and sharp elbows. Women and children have first priority, then pensioners. Trains heading eastwards depart mostly empty, while those in the other direction are mobbed by crowds as soon as they pulled into the platform. “Look at what they did in Kharkiv. Nothing will stop them doing that here,” said Polina, a student trying to get out of Kyiv to resume her studies in Vienna. Tuesday, the day after the first images of destruction in Kharkiv appeared on television, was the start of the crush, as people began to see the “Aleppo option” as a real possibility for Kyiv. While there has been fierce fighting on the western edges of Kyiv, the centre of the capital has not seen heavy bombardments this week, except for a strike against the television tower that killed five people. But this grim anticipation is its own kind of torture. At one metro station in the suburbs of Kyiv on Thursday, there were about 100 people spread out across the platform and sprawled on benches in the open carriages of a train parked in the station, hiding from possible airstrikes. Some had tupperware plastic containers of food, folding furniture and mattresses, while others slept on the cold floor with just a blanket and pillow. Lying on a bench with half a toilet roll, a cup of strong tea and a hunk of bread, 54-year-old Ivan had been inside the station for eight days. He had travelled into Kyiv on 22 February from his home town of Ivankiv, to work a 48-hour shift in his construction job. By the time his shift was over, Russia had invaded and there was fighting in his home town and along the route. Since then, he has been sleeping in the metro, eating food delivered by volunteers, unable to get home to his wife and young daughter. “It’s a completely impossible situation. When my daughter was born, I was 49 and my wife was 42, we didn’t expect to have a child, but God gave us one. And now she’s a child of war, and I can’t be there,” he said. Amid the new reality, some are trying hard to keep some remnants of the old life functioning. Andriy Hrushchinskyy of Kyivspetstrans, the company responsible for collecting roughly 70% of the city’s household waste, said 14 out of his 30 refuse trucks were out on the roads, even though many of the workers had left their jobs and gone to fight. “I have a gun and I’m itching to pick it up and go to fight, but I realise if I don’t do this work, nobody else will, and I’m trying to persuade my guys that they should also stay,” he said, in an interview during a brief walk outside the coordination centre from where many of the city’s key services are now run. He said it was important for those left behind in the city to see that services were functioning, as it was a reassuring sign that life goes on. Handing out weapons to tens of thousands of people, many of whom have had little training, has led to some problematic situations. With reports of Russian saboteur groups – diversanty – at work in and around the city, tension is high and everyone is a potential source of suspicion. At one checkpoint outside Kyiv earlier in the week, a man could be seen tied up at the side of the road. Amid persistent rumours that Russian diversanty may in certain cases be disguised as foreign journalists, some nervous residents have taken to calling in sightings of journalists to police. There are many reports of friendly fire incidents. One man from the southern Russian republic of Dagestan, who has lived in Kyiv since 2015 and is volunteering with a Ukrainian territorial defence unit, said he was no longer able to go outside without his comrades, because of suspicions he could be one of the Chechen assassin groups reportedly sent into Ukraine by Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya’s Kremlin-backed leader. The man, who did not want to give his name, said the one time he had gone out alone since the start of the war, he was immediately arrested, had a bag put over his head and was driven away for questioning as a suspected diversant, before his commander was called in to vouch that he was fighting on the Ukrainian side. “Now, my job is that if they catch any suspicious Chechens, I get sent there to question them and work out if they’re Kadyrov’s guys or not,” he said. There is a reason for the fear and paranoia: few doubt that Russia really has sent diversionary groups into Ukraine, and there are persistent rumours of a plot to assassinate the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy’s insistence on remaining in Kyiv has amazed foreign diplomats, while his rousing speeches and exhausted but defiant countenance have inspired many Ukrainians over the past 10 days. In the government quarter in the centre of Kyiv, the defence of Zelenskiy is being overseen by a mixture of the army, the national guard, special forces and territorial defence units. The commander of the territorial defence unit based in a building near the presidential administration is 58-year-old Yevgeny Ptashnik. He said this was his third war, after Afghanistan in the 1980s and east Ukraine in 2014. He volunteered on the first day. He said the current Ukrainian struggled reminded him of the fight of the determined Afghans against the powerful but unmotivated Soviet army. “However much we criticise Russians, they still have human feelings, they come here and see that old people and women come out to the streets, and they will be scared,” he said, speaking over a series of booms in the distance. “And unlike the Afghans, we also have a lot of modern weapons, thanks to Europe and America.”",News/World news,"As civilians leave, fortress Kyiv grimly prepares for Russian advance",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/fortress-kyiv-ukraine-grimly-anticipates-russia-advance
3/6/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has criticised the Chelsea fans who interrupted a moment of applause for Ukraine by singing about their billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich. “It’s not the moment to do this,” the Chelsea manager said of the chants that were heard from a significant contingent of the travelling support before the Premier League game against Burnley. “If we show solidarity, we should show solidarity together.” The gesture, which was met by boos from the Burnley fans, marred a planned minute’s applause for the Ukrainian people and felt particularly provocative given that the Chelsea owner has as yet failed to condemn Vladimir Putin for his expansionist war in Ukraine. Tuchel did not hesitate to condemn the singing, calling for Chelsea fans to show more respect in such situations. “We take the knee together, if a person from our club dies we show respect,” he said. “It’s not a moment to give other messages. “We also do this because of what we are as a club. We show respect, and we need our fans to commit to this minute of applause in the moment. “We do it for the people of Ukraine and there is no second opinion about the situation. They have our thoughts and our support and we should stand together as a club.” Of some consolation to Tuchel was the fact that a turbulent week, which saw Abramovich announce his intention to sell the club following defeat in the Carabao Cup final, has ended with progress in the FA Cup against Luton and this 4-0 win over Burnley. “It shows a lot of character,” he said of his players’ response. “It shows the guys have what it takes to play for Chelsea and we have the environment to focus on football, because we are allowed to focus on football. The team did very well and we kept on believing.” Three Chelsea goals in the space of eight minutes after half-time wrapped up the game and Sean Dyche lamented his team’s collapse after a promising start. “It’s the madness of football,” he said. “Conceding doesn’t mean you have to stop what you’re doing. “We opened up too quickly, we stopped doing all the basic principles, lost out physically in a couple of challenges, and got punished by a group of very talented players.”",Sport/Football,‘Show some respect’: Tuchel hits out at Chelsea fans for Abramovich chant,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/show-some-respect-tuchel-blasts-chelsea-fans-for-abramovich-chant
