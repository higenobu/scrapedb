A statement confirms that the ceremony has been postponed indefinitely with no new date yet announced.  The awards were set to take place on 31 January at the Crypto.com center in Los Angeles and while sporting events have still been taking place there, sources claim that artists and executives have expressed concern over attending this year’s Grammys ceremony. “The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority,” the statement read. “Given the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant, holding the show on January 31st simply contains too many risks. We look forward to celebrating music’s biggest night on a future date, which will be announced soon.” Los Angeles has been seeing a surge in cases along with the rest of the country with a record-breaking number of cases. On 4 January, more than 22,000 people in Los Angeles county tested positive, almost double the previous peak at the start of 2021. This year’s ceremony was set to be hosted by Trevor Noah with nominations led by Jon Batiste, HER and Justin Bieber. Last year’s awards were also delayed until March. The postponement follows a string of other shifts within the entertainment industry including a hiatus for Broadway shows including The Music Man (after stars Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster both tested positive for Covid-19) and Mrs Doubtfire and today, this year’s Sundance film festival also announced it was ditching its hybrid physical and digital plans to go fully online later this month, in line with last year. “Despite the most ambitious protocols, the Omicron variant with its unexpectedly high transmissibility rates is pushing the limits of health safety, travel and other infrastructures across the country,” organizers said in a statement.

1/6/2022,"Good morning. Novak Djokovic spends hours at Melbourne airport over visa mix-up, data confirms Donald Trump’s enduring hold over vast sections of America and Covid concerns in a Sydney nursing home. The world No 1 men’s tennis player Novak Djokovic has been held at passport control in Melbourne for several hours, throwing fresh doubt over his participation at the Australian Open. It comes after the reigning Australian Open champion was announced he had been granted a Covid-19-related “medical exemption” by tournament organisers. Scott Morrison has said there would be no “special rules” for the Serbian, and if he failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his medical exemption the 20-time Grand Slam champion will be “on the next plane home”. Djokovic has refused to reveal his Covid vaccine status and has been an outspoken opponent of vaccination for the coronavirus.  A major Covid outbreak at a Sydney nursing home has left residents reportedly “petrified”, with families questioning how the disease spread to 38 residents and 25 care staff and the timing of booster shots. Meanwhile, importers of Covid rapid tests have blamed regulatory delays for preventing home use, further strangling supply at a time of peak demand. One company claims they’ve been waiting three months for the national regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, to give the green light for its product to be used at home. More than 40% of Americans still do not believe that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 US presidential election, a new poll has found, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud ever being proven. The data was released on the first anniversary of the 6 January attack on the Capitol, provoked by Donald Trump’s claim that the election was stolen. New research has also found that more than 1,000 Americans in positions of public trust acted as “accomplices” in attempting to overturn the 2020 result. The former president earlier cancelled a press conference scheduled to mark the day. Small businesses across Australia are grappling with acute staff shortages, as skyrocketing Covid cases and complications surrounding testing keep thousands of workers away from their places of employment. More than one in 10 staff at one of northern NSW’s biggest hospitals have resigned, citing crippling workload, burnout and significantly better working conditions across the border in Queensland. Paramedics have experienced their busiest month in the 126-year history of the NSW Ambulance service, with the state’s health minister and premier calling on residents to stop making unnecessarily calls. In this column, a Sydney-based paramedic shares their concerns. Archibald prize-winning artist Craig Ruddy has died from Covid-related complications, aged 53. Ruddy was revered for his paintings of David Gulpilil, Cathy Freeman and Bruce Pascoe.

The pernicious effect of social media on youth mental health has been a repeated focus for Scott Morrison, with the prime minister campaigning prominently on reforming online safety. And while Australia’s children’s commissioner supports these efforts, as Anne Hollonds tells Paul Karp, there are many and multifaceted roots to youth self-harm or poor mental health that long precede the rise of social media. Standup paddleboarding – or sup-ing, to those in the know – is about the closest you can get to water without getting wet.

And having finally got his man in Sydney, Geoff Lemon examines the case for the man responsible for Warner’s 2019 “Ashes immolation”. “Thin-skinned and indignant.” That’s Andy Bull’s assessment of England’s managing director Ashley Giles’s “scattergun broadsides” as the finger pointing and blame shifting within the visiting camp continues after their meek 3-0 Ashes capitulation. Anthony Albanese has ruled out a minimum tax rate for Australia’s highest income-earners, effectively dropping a policy he previously championed inside the Labor party, the Australian reports. Western Australia’s Covid exposure has expanded with five new Delta cases linked to the so-called “backpacker cluster”, the ABC writes.

1/6/2022,"A nurse who claimed she was victimised for wearing a necklace with a Christian cross at work has won a case for unfair dismissal. Mary Onuoha, a theatre practitioner at Croydon university hospital, Surrey, was discriminated against and harassed, an employment tribunal ruled on Wednesday.  Onuoha, a Catholic, wore a necklace with a small cross pendant both in and out of work as a symbol of her religious devotion. However, Croydon Health Services NHS Trust’s uniform policy prohibited the wearing of necklaces in clinical areas on the basis that they could be a health and safety risk. Onuoha was asked to remove her necklace in 2014, 13 years after she began working at the hospital. She refused for religious reasons, and refused again when the issue was raised again in 2015 and 2016. Further efforts by the trust to get Onuoha to remove the necklace, or wear it inside her uniform, failed. She was suspended from clinical duties and demoted to working as a receptionist which she said left her feeling humiliated. She resigned in 2020 and claimed constructive and unfair dismissal. She argued that the trust had breached her right to religion under article 9 of the European convention on human rights, and that her treatment was religious discrimination, harassment and victimisation under the 2010 Equality Act. According to the tribunal’s ruling, the wearing of jewellery, including necklaces, was “rife” among the trust’s workforce and was “widely tolerated” by management. The trust allowed employees to wear other items of religious apparel such as headscarves, turbans and kalava bracelets. “There was no proper explanation as to why those items were permitted but a cross-necklace was not,” the ruling said. The trust had “directly discriminated against and harassed” Onuoha, and her “dismissal had been both discriminatory and unfair”. However, the suggestion that the trust had deliberately targeted the cross necklace as a symbol of the Christian faith or that the trust had acted out of “any kind of prejudice towards the Christian faith” was rejected by a majority of the tribunal. Onuoha said: “My cross has been with me for 40 years. It is part of me, and my faith, and it has never caused anyone any harm. “At this hospital there are members of staff who go to a mosque four times a day and no one says anything to them. Hindus wear red bracelets on their wrists and female Muslims wear hijabs in theatre. “Yet my small cross around my neck was deemed so dangerous that I was no longer allowed to do my job. I am a strong woman but I have been treated like a criminal.” Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre which supported Onuoha’s case, said: “From the beginning this case has been about the high-handed attack from the NHS bureaucracy on the right of a devoted and industrious nurse to wear a cross – the worldwide, recognised and cherished symbol of the Christian faith. “Any employer will now have to think very carefully before restricting wearing of crosses in the workplace.”",News/Society,"Nurse ‘victimised’ for wearing cross at work was unfairly dismissed, tribunal rules",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/nurse-victimised-for-wearing-cross-at-work-was-unfairly-dismissed-tribunal-rules
1/6/2022,"In front of the old New Orleans train station where, in 1892, Homer Plessy engaged in a trailblazing act of civil disobedience that led to the landmark Plessy v Ferguson supreme court decision, Louisiana’s governor stood 130 years later and issued a posthumous pardon to the late civil rights pioneer. Beneath a grey sky and in a ceremony laced with symbolism and repentance, governor John Bel Edwards signed the pardon for Plessy, a Creole man of color who purchased a ticket for a whites-only train cabin and was subsequently arrested for violating Louisiana’s Separate Car Act.  Plessy’s case resulted in the infamous 1896 court decision, which legalized the “separate but equal” doctrine and ushered in the Jim Crow era of racist segregation. “The stroke of my pen on this pardon, while momentous, it doesn’t erase generations of pain and discrimination. It doesn’t eradicate all the wrongs wrought by the Plessy court, or fix all of our present challenges,” Edwards said. “But this pardon is a step in the right direction.” The ceremony, on the grounds of the old station that is now a campus for the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, was attended by descendants of both Plessy and John Ferguson, the Louisiana judge who initially ruled against Plessy before the case made it to the supreme court. “This is truly a blessed day for ancestors and elders. For children and children yet to be born,” said Keith Plessy, Homer’s cousin three times removed. Holding back tears, he continued: “I feel like my feet are not touching the ground today, because the ancestors are carrying me.” The ceremony began with a rendition of the hymn Lift Every Voice and Sing, performed by a cellist, Kate Dillingham, descended from the lone dissenting supreme court justice in the Plessy case, John Marshall Harlan. In his dissent, Harlan wrote that the ruling “will, in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made by this tribunal in the Dred Scott case” – a reference to the 1857 decision that said no Black person who had been enslaved or was descended from a slave could ever become a US citizen. The Louisiana parole board voted unanimously in November to pardon Plessy, leaving the final act in the process with Governor Edwards. The pardon marked the first time Louisiana’s Avery C Alexander pardon law, passed in 2006 to allow victims of racist laws clemency, has been used in the state. The effort was driven by New Orleans’s recently elected district attorney, Jason Williams, a progressive reformer who came to office on a wave of grassroots support. On Wednesday, Williams addressed the ceremony, insisting that the district attorney’s office should never have prosecuted Plessy at all. “It was important that the office that prosecuted Homer Plessy be the office that asked for his name to be pardoned,” Williams said. “My predecessor should not have prosecuted Homer Plessy.” He continued: “I did not submit this pardon asking for Homer Plessy to be forgiven. I submitted it asking for us, the institution, to be forgiven.”",News/US news,"Homer Plessy, US civil rights pioneer, receives pardon 130 years on",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/homer-plessy-supreme-court-pardon-louisiana-new-orleans
1/6/2022,"It’s an ill wind and all that. With Keir Starmer testing positive for Covid for the second time in a matter of months, it was the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who got to take on Boris Johnson at the first prime minister’s questions of the new year. Which was just the news that Johnson didn’t want to hear, because Rayner is his worst nightmare. First off, she’s a woman and Boris has a major problem relating to women without mansplaining. More importantly, though, she’s a working-class woman who is very comfortable speaking her mind. Where Starmer may back off and err on the side of caution and politesse, Rayner is never happier than when going toe to toe. Especially when she’s up against someone who is struggling in the polls and whom she doesn’t much respect.  Rayner began with a flick at the ongoing investigation into parties at No 10 – it never hurts to remind your opponent of nasties coming down the road – before homing in on the here and now. In October he had said that fears of inflation were unfounded. Given that inflation was now running at 6%, how had he managed to get it all so wrong? “Um, er,” said Johnson. For a moment – the trademark hesitations and incoherence aside – it looked as though Johnson might actually try to answer the question directly. He even began a half-formed sentence to that end. Then half way through he gave up and decided to do what he always does. When under pressure or not. He started lying. How could he have forgotten to do something so natural to him? Maybe it was the Rayner effect. “I said no such thing,” he continued. It was a pure invention that just happened to have been captured in an interview he had given to Sky. From that point on, Johnson was pretty much lost, careering from one car crash to the next. In between wittering on about cold weather payments and the warm home discount – he claimed it was worth £140 a week: it isn’t, it’s £140 a year, though this was probably less a lie and more total ignorance – he just bounced from one lie to the next causing ever greater self-harm. First he tried to claim that the country would be in lockdown if Labour had got its way. Where he got this idea from is anyone’s guess. Most likely it was his own wish fulfilment; what he would have liked to do had he not been too weak to face down the rightwing libertarians in the Tory party. All Labour had ever done was back plan B and said it would be guided by the scientific data. Then he smashed into the next lie. Labour was committed to nationalising the gas industry. It isn’t: Starmer has specifically ruled that out. Then, when Rayner wondered why the government was so keen to rule out cutting VAT on fuel bills – something Johnson had promised as a Brexit dividend – Boris exploded into faux outrage. How dare people who had voted to stay in the EU demand that he keep his promises? He was fully entitled to break as many as he liked to remainers. And, in any case, Labour wanted to rejoin the EU. Pure fantasy. Even the Lib Dems have given up on that one. When Starmer is faced with so many lies in a matter of minutes, he tends to have a mini-meltdown himself. As if the idea of a prime minister being unable to tell the truth does not compute with his version of reality. And you can sort of see his point. It’s a sign of how low we’ve sunk into the shit that we’ve grown used to the idea of Johnson as a serial liar. We don’t expect anything else from him. But where Keir, frets, Rayner runs with it. Sensing Boris was badly losing the plot – if you can lose something you never really had – she paused to ask if he was feeling OK? And he really wasn’t. He was having one of his worst days. He knew that all of his lies would unravel long before the end of PMQs but was unable to prevent himself from telling them. He was so busted. So exposed. He knew it and his own benches knew it. Some Tories tried to offer some encouragement – their jobs are hanging by the same thread as Boris’s and, like it or not, they are symbiotically entwined with him – but it was all a bit half-hearted. Not least because all the red wall MPs care about their constituents’ cost of living. The session ended with Edward Leigh moaning about foreigners. Boris couldn’t bring himself to tell him Vote Leave had promised Indians they could come to the UK post Brexit. Things didn’t much improve for Johnson when he came to give the Covid statement right after PMQs. There again, it’s never the easiest lie to spin that you’ve made all the right calls for the right reasons, when everyone knows that you only did what your party would allow. Or more specifically what the Coronavirus Recovery Group would allow. Donkeys led by yet more donkeys. Rayner pointed out some of the more obvious dangers of hospitals being overwhelmed, operations cancelled and people with heart attacks expected to take a bus to A&E but it was the SNP’s Ian Blackford who got to the heart of the matter. Riding out the pandemic had consequences. More people would die. Which probably wouldn’t affect Boris or many Tory MPs that much, but would certainly be one hell of a bummer for those who died. And for their friends and families. So maybe now was the time for a bit more caution. A bit of humility. Only Johnson doesn’t do caution or humility. He just ducks and dives, doing what he needs to do to get through to the end of the day more or less intact. The consequences left to pile up for tomorrow. Steve Baker and Mark Harper, two hardline members of the CRG, invited Boris to end all restrictions now. In their world, it is their bravery in standing up to Omicron that had forced it into being weaker than Delta. Had the government imposed another lockdown, Omicron would have been inspired to be a much stronger variant. Or something. Whatever drugs they are on, count me out. Boris hummed and hahed, before saying the plan B restrictions ended in three weeks anyway and he would see how things had panned out by then. Hopefully all those who were going die would hurry up and get their dying in during the next weeks so he would then be able to wing it again. It’s come to something that surviving this episode of the pandemic will come down to luck rather than scientific judgement. Then Boris will be Boris.",News/Politics,Johnson fumbles and flails under pressure from Rayner| john crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/johnson-fumbles-and-flails-under-pressure-from-rayner
1/6/2022,"This beautifully brooding slice of English pastoral places Cecil Sharp, the godfather of folk music who collected thousands of songs from rural communities, alongside two women he met in 1903. They were half-sisters, Louie Hooper and Lucy White, daughters of a renowned singer in south Somerset who, at the start of this drama, has just died, leaving them drenched in grief. It is clear why Nell Leyshon’s script was adapted into a BBC audio drama last year, starring Simon Russell Beale and Amanda Wilkin. It bursts with sound, from distant birdsong to folk tunes the sisters sing as they sew gloves to make ends meet.  But the visual aspects of this production are just as enthralling with Matt Haskins’s dappled light throwing shadows across Rose Revitt’s simple, striking set, sometimes lighting up the sisters with the clarity of a Vermeer painting to capture the everyday drama of bucolic working life. Sharp’s meeting with Louie and his appropriation of her songs lie at the play’s heart, though the sisters’ relationship runs deftly alongside it. The production is paced to perfection by Roxana Silbert and full of delicate but deeply mined emotions, every actor shining in their part. Song is finely integrated into the script with spine-tingling moments when Louie (Mariam Haque, quiveringly expressive) sings her haunting solos. Lucy (Sasha Frost, just as brilliant as the more flirtatious, frustrated sister) intermittently joins in along with her sometimes lover, John (Ben Allen), to give the play a bustling community feel. Simon Robson’s Sharp is a slyly manipulative figure, quickly switching on the charm when he sees his opportunity with Louie. He goes from cajoling her into singing her mother’s songs for him, even when her grief is raw, to the full-circle betrayal of handing over a book of those songs now “tidied up” and appearing under his authorship. Like Jean Rhys’s 1962 short story, Let Them Call It Jazz, about a Caribbean woman whose song is taken and sung by a man at a west London party, Leyshon explores questions around the archiving and ownership of an oral tradition, capturing all the nuance in the debate, from whether it needs preserving in this formal way to if it can remain authentic in that process. Sharp, who has since been accused of racism and misogyny, not only flattens out Louie’s songs but projects his jingoism on to them. “I see England,” he says when he first hears her sing and speaks of the “purity” of Englishness in her sound, seeing her as a “primitive” force within the land, which sounds close to Rousseau’s Noble Savage. For her, songs are also connected to the land but without his toxic nationalism; as she points out, the songs were passed down to her mother by her “Gypsy” father, who collected his verses through his travels. Where Sharp wants to fix Englishness on to the page in his compositions, she tells him, wisely, that “none of it stays still” and this aspect of the play speaks to contemporary anxieties over nationhood and identity. The play’s intellectual explorations never overshadow its emotional drama; we feel Louie’s betrayal and also a strong sense of the sisters’ complicated bond. Louie’s dependency and Lucy’s desire to leave creates a tension resembling Tennessee Williams siblings. The tenderness between them develops slowly and powerfully, the story in the end as much about their songs, indelibly tied to love, grief, memory and Somerset itself, as it is about what Sharp takes from them.

1/6/2022,"Researchers studying the purple-crowned fairy wren in far northern Western Australia have discovered the birds romancing outside the normal breeding season for the second year running. The development is highly unusual in the 16-year program at the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s (AWC) Mornington Wildlife Sanctuary, which closely monitors the birds and was identified in a three-week survey carried out during the dry season in October and November.  Ordinarily breeding takes place during the wet season between December to April when insects are plentiful. It is indicated by “brood patches” – bare patches on the belly – of female birds and bent tail feathers caused when they nest their eggs in cramped nests. But Dr Niki Teunissen, a postdoctoral research fellow at Monash University who conducted the recent dry-season survey, said that when she caught female birds they showed all the telltale signs of a “busy season”. “Some of those females already had fledglings, so they’d already successfully bred,” Teunissen said. “Then I caught them and found that they had brood patches, which means they already had a nest again. So it’s a busy season. “We don’t really understand why it’s happening but we would love to find out.” As it is had occurred for the second year running the discovery upended much of what researchers thought they knew about the bird’s lifecycle. Teunissen said there may be several contributing factors for the birds changing up their schedule, though so far any theories were “speculative” without further research. She said the region had experienced good rainfall after a period of drought which may make it more attractive for the birds, especially as life can be difficult during the wet season. Not only is their habitat – wetlands along rivers – under threat from fire and cattle grazing, but it is also prone to flash flooding during the wet season that can see local waterways rise metres in a matter of minutes. Last wet season 40% – two in every five nests – were washed away. Another contributing factor may be pressure from cuckoos that lay their eggs in the wrens’ nests for the wrens to raise. As the cuckoos are not around in the dry season it is possible the wrens have adapted. “What I take away from it is that if anything these birds are clearly more flexible in terms of the time of breeding than we thought,” Teunissen said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The purple-crowned fairy wren has two sub-species – the eastern sub-species and the western sub-species. The population being studied by the AWC belongs to the western sub-species. The birds get their name for the purple crown the males wear during the breeding season. This colouring fades when not in season, but last season they were purple all year round. With only an estimated 7,000 birds in the wild they are considered an endangered population that is in decline. The birds only live for four years on average, however the oldest bird tracked by the program has lived to 15 years. Unlike the superb fairy wren, which has a reputation for promiscuity with the female birds regularly cheating on their partners, Teunissen says purple-crowned fairy wren’s are “quite faithful”. The birds do not always mate for life but they can form stable relationships with couples raising their young together and defending their territory together outside breeding season.

1/6/2022,"At least seven historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) across the United States received back-to-back bomb threats this week, forcing students to evacuate or shelter in place while authorities investigated. The threats come amid a dramatic rise in bombings in the US and follow bomb threats at other US colleges last November.  The targeted HBCUs spanned six states and Washington D.C., including Prairie View A&M University in Texas, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Howard University, Florida Memorial University, Norfolk State University in Virginia, North Carolina Central University, and Xavier University in New Orleans. Some students and university employees were put on lockdown, while others were forced to relocate off-campus. The schools have since given the all-clear, the Washington Post reported. Whether the barrage of violent threats targeting universities that have historically served Black students was a series of isolated events or part of a larger conspiracy was not immediately clear, the Post reported. While some of the threats were later deemed unfounded, police warned that at least one had been “very real”, according to local New Orleans news channel WDSU. None resulted in explosions. The incidents were not the first bomb threats on college campuses this academic year. Last semester, three Ivy League schools – Cornell University, Columbia University and Brown University – all reported similar warnings, none of which were found to be credible. This week’s events also come after an alarming uptick in bombings in the US. In a report on 2020, the United States Bomb Data Center recorded 25% fewer bomb threats than in 2019. Yet it tallied 428 actual bombings – an astronomical 71% increase from the year before.

1/6/2022,"Canadians will receive 140m rapid tests for free throughout January, Justin Trudeau announced on Wednesday, as the country struggles to cope with record-breaking Covid case numbers. “With the speed at which Omicron is propagating through our communities and through our country, it makes sense to have rapid testing,” said the prime minister.  Health minister Jean-Yves Duclos said that rapid tests are proving to be an important tool in the fight against Covid. But the decision to invest in rapid testing marks a dramatic change in a country where – until last month – rapid tests were not commonly available, despite successful implementation in the US, UK and Europe. The delay of rapid test adoption in Canada was caused by a couple factors, David Juncker, department chair of biomedical engineering at McGill University, told the Guardian. He said a “false sense of perfection” on testing sensitivity and an unnecessarily complicated maze of rules prevented Canada from acquiring the rapid self-tests the country would have needed to slow the spread of Omicron. “They were focused on sensitivity that they haven’t come around to understand this test is a public health test,” Juncker said. The scientific community has known since the summer of 2020 that Covid-19 tests’ sensitivity is less important that the frequency and speed of testing, particularly when it comes to stopping asymptomatic people from spreading disease. Concerns over sensitivity led to an over-reliance on PCR testing, and slowed down approvals and procurement deals for rapid tests. The current Omicron surge has provincial and territorial PCR facilities completely overwhelmed, which has led some to limit the public’s access to such testing. Provincial governments have also played a key role in the slow adoption of rapid testing. Canada acquired several million rapid tests at the end of 2020. However, most provinces failed to distribute the tests they were given over sensitivity concerns. Juncker said provinces claimed they wanted to do more research before rolling the tests out. On Wednesday, Trudeau was asked whether he had any qualms with the way provinces have chosen to distribute their supplies of rapid tests. He said he hoped they would learn and share best practices, but that the federal government had no real say in the matter. “Our job is to procure as many [tests] as we possibly can,” said Trudeau. The first self-test was only approved in Canada on 23 April 2021, six months after the FDA approved the same test for use in the US. All previously approved tests – including rapid tests – required professional administration or lab processing.
