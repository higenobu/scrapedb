4/29/2022,"Russia attacked western Kyiv with two cruise missiles during a visit by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to the Ukrainian capital. Two loud explosions rocked Kyiv on Thursday evening after Guterres visited the site of massacres and mass graves on the city’s outskirts. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the strikes happened “immediately after” his talks with the UN chief. Ten were injured in the blast, which hit the central Shevchenkivskyi district, and three people were hospitalised, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. A 25-storey residential building was partially destroyed. In his latest address, Zelenskiy addressed the strike on Kyiv, saying that Ukraine could not let its guard down. “Moscow claimed they had allegedly ceased fire in Mariupol. But the bombing of the defenders of the city continues,” he said. “This is a war crime committed by the Russian military literally in front of the whole world.” The UK will send 8,000 soldiers to eastern Europe on expanded exercises to combat Russian aggression in one of the largest deployments since the cold war. Dozens of tanks will be deployed to countries ranging from Finland to North Macedonia between April and June. Joe Biden has called for a giant $33bn package of military and economic aid to Ukraine, more than doubling the level of US assistance to date. The package would include over $20bn in military aid, including heavy artillery and armoured vehicles, greater intelligence sharing, cyberwarfare tools and many more anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. “We’re not attacking Russia. We’re helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,” Biden said. A British citizen has been killed in Ukraine and a second is missing, the Foreign Office has confirmed, amid reports that both were volunteers who had gone to fight in the country. The Briton who died was understood to be Scott Sibley, a former British soldier who had served in Iraq. Russian forces have been hitting the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol with the heaviest strikes yet, a local official said.Meanwhile, a senior US defence official said the US had seen indications that some Russian forces were leaving Mariupol and moving towards the north-west, even as fighting for the Ukrainian port city continued. The UN secretary general, Guterres, said the UN was “doing everything possible” to evacuate people from the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. “They need an escape route out of the apocalypse,” Guterres said. Zelenskiy added that he believed that a “successful result” was still possible “in terms of deblocking” the Mariupol plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was probing a report that a missile had flown directly over a nuclear power station, adding it would be “extremely serious” if true. The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, said Kyiv had formally told the agency the missile flew over the plant in southern Ukraine on 16 April. The facility is near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk, 350km (220 miles) south of Kyiv. The UN general assembly will vote on 11 May replacing Russia on the world organisation’s leading human rights body after its suspension over allegations of rights violations by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Assembly spokeswoman Paulina Kubiak said the Czech Republic was the only candidate for the seat on the 47-member human rights council. Ukraine’s prosecutor general has named 10 Russian soldiers allegedly involved in human rights abuses during the month-long occupation of Bucha. There were 8,653 alleged war crimes under investigation, according to the prosecutor’s office. Guterres described the war as “an absurdity” in the 21st century on a visit to the scene of civilian killings outside Kyiv. Guterres was touring Borodianka, where Russian forces are accused of massacring civilians before their withdrawal, on his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the invasion. Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Nicu Popescu, said the country was facing “a very dangerous new moment” as unnamed forces were seeking to stoke tensions after a series of explosions in the breakaway region of Transnistria this week. Popescu said his government had seen “a dangerous deterioration of the situation” in recent days amid attacks in the region. The European Union will consider it as a violation of sanctions if European energy companies comply with Moscow’s requirement to open a payment account in roubles with Gazprombank, EU officials warned. The EU “cannot accept” that payments in euros for Russian gas are considered completed by Moscow only after they are converted into roubles, an official said. Nato said it was ready to maintain its support for Ukraine in the war against Russia for years, including help for Kyiv to shift from Soviet-era weapons to modern western arms and systems. “We need to be prepared for the long term,” Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, told a summit in Brussels. “There is absolutely the possibility that this war will drag on and last for months and years.”",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 65 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-65-of-the-invasion
4/29/2022,"Police feared one of Ben Roberts-Smith’s SAS witnesses in his defamation case was going to destroy evidence on his phone when they confronted him with a search warrant in a city hotel late on Tuesday night. The former soldier, who hours earlier had finished giving evidence to the defamation trial, appeared “intoxicated, acting in a belligerent, unreasonable and aggressive manner”, court documents say. Australian Federal Police officers approached the man at a city centre hotel in Sydney just after 11pm Tuesday night, informing him they were executing a search warrant. “The accused attempted to enter the lift to leave the hotel and refused to hand over his mobile phone. When prevented from entering the lift, to prevent the destruction of evidence, being the mobile phone in his possession, the accused tensed up, clenched his fist, and shoved police to the body, constituting an assault.” The man was arrested and taken into custody overnight. He appeared before Sydney Central Local Court on Wednesday where he was bailed on a $10,000 surety. He faces two charges: obstruct, hinder, intimidate, or resist a commonwealth official; and cause harm to a commonwealth judicial or law officer. The former soldier was allowed to fly out of Australia to another country where he lives, with conditions placed on where he is to reside. A suppression order has been placed on the man’s identity, with the court directing he be referred to by the pseudonym Person X. Earlier, Person X gave evidence, called by Roberts-Smith, as part of Roberts-Smith’s defamation case against three newspapers he alleges defamed him in a series of articles that accused him of committing war crimes, including murder. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial: police feared witness would destroy phone evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/ben-roberts-smith-defamation-trial-police-feared-witness-would-destroy-phone-evidence
4/29/2022,"The NRL has threatened to take the grand final away from its traditional home of Sydney should the New South Wales government not meet its demands over funding for suburban stadiums. Ahead of a meeting with the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet on Friday, Peter V’landys, the Australian Rugby League Commission chair, warned this year’s showpiece event could yet be staged in Brisbane for a second straight year. The NSW government and league are at odds after Gladys Berejiklian’s administration went back on a promise to upgrade the Olympic stadium at Homebush, now called Accor stadium, as part of a deal struck in 2018 that would keep the grand final there until 2042. The NRL now wants those funds to be reallocated to the upgrade of several suburban grounds – and appears willing to use the location of future grand finals as a high-value bargaining chip. “We just want our suburban stadiums in NSW, we want that tribalism to occur,” V’landys told the Today show on Friday. “We want people to walk to the games. We want those promises honoured by the NSW government. If they don’t we’ll take it elsewhere.” Last year’s grand final between Penrith and South Sydney was switched to Queensland due to the Covid-19 lockdown in NSW and was played in front of 39,000 fans at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium. Annastacia Palaszczuk’s government on Wednesday would not be drawn on reports it had submitted an official bid to take the game from NSW, but said it was “happy to talk to the NRL about any proposal”. The NSW government has moved to reassure fans that the grand final would stay in Sydney, and Perrottet claimed earlier in the week that “no one wants the grand final in Queensland, including Peter [V’landys]”. But on Friday, V’landys said hosting rights for the game were “up for grabs” unless the NSW government swiftly committed to investing in suburban grounds. “The deal was they would spend $800m on stadiums, but rather than spending it on ANZ stadium or Accor stadium as it’s now known, we want it spent on suburban stadiums. “We want to build that tribalism, where games can be held. The government agrees with it but are so slow to move. We want ink on paper, that agreement in writing. Until we get that, the grand final is up for grabs. “I’m hoping he [Perrottet] actually speeds it up today because he is a can-do man. You have to look at the other states how much they are investing in events. The NSW government has an event on its doorstep, and they can’t get even get that [locked in]. Victoria is picking up all these events that are contributing millions and tens of millions to the local community.” The NRL has every reason to try to stimulate some healthy competition between potential venues. Queensland would be a clear frontrunner should the game be taken away from Sydney but other states could enter a a potential bidding war – including Victoria, where the 100,000-capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground presents a mouthwatering option. NSW, the game’s heartland where the majority of NRL clubs are based, had hosted every grand final since 1908 before Brisbane had its moment in the spotlight last year. Queensland’s capital also hosted the one-off Super League grand final in 1997, but otherwise Sydney has managed to maintain a tight hold on the game for over a century.",Sport/Sport,NRL threatens to take grand final away from Sydney over stadium demands,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/29/nrl-threatens-to-take-grand-final-away-from-sydney-over-stadium-demands
