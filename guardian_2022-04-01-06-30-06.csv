4/1/2022,"Just off the Corniche, the waterfront drag that runs along Doha’s bay to the city, stands the countdown clock, a digital hour glass that lets everybody know – in days, hours, minutes and seconds – how long there is to go until the big kick-off. It was in December 2010 that Qatar was awarded the right to host the 2022 World Cup and, if you rack your memory hard enough, you will still hear the gasps and howls of indignation from the conference hall in Zurich. It is rather closer now – 235 days away, according to the clock on Thursday – and the focus will be sharpened significantly on Friday at 5pm BST when the star-studded draw ceremony is held. The England manager, Gareth Southgate, will be there and he will hope that the draw assistants, who include Cafu and Lothar Matthäus, winning captains with Brazil and West Germany respectively, can do him a favour. England are in the top pot of seeds and Southgate would probably prefer to avoid Germany and the Netherlands from Pot 2. He has had the luck of the draw at his previous two tournaments, the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020, when his team reached the semi-final and final respectively. Can it endure? It would be wrong to describe the mood among the local people in Doha as one of overwhelming excitement. They are looking forward to the tournament but the trappings of it are not exactly everywhere, even if there are advertising billboards bearing the slogan: “Now Is All.” It is all pretty conservative and restrained. Southgate, though, can feel the tingle of anticipation, the flood of World Cup memories, mainly from his childhood. Like everybody, the 51-year-old has vague recollections of his first finals – Argentina ’78, when England did not qualify – and vivid ones of the next, Spain ’82. It was when Italy beat West Germany in the final, having knocked out Brazil in the second group stage after that 3-2 epic. “Seventy-eight was the first one I remember … the ticker tape, having to support Scotland, which was painful, but I did,” Southgate said. “And then ’82 … not only loving watching England but the tears when Brazil went out and watching the final with Italy winning. “They’ll show videos at the draw of previous tournaments and we won’t be shown in many of them, so you’ll remind yourself of that. The World Cup is very special. It’s the pinnacle. It’s still the ultimate prize.” Yet does this edition not feel a little odd and unsettling given the issues in Qatar, namely the Gulf state’s woeful labour rights record, its outlawing of homosexuality and its male guardianship system that denies women the right to make key decisions about their lives? “It’s the first World Cup in a Muslim country, the first in the Middle East and it’s the first World Cup in the middle of the season so it’s a hugely different feel, culturally,” Southgate said, calibrating his answer carefully. “But I went to the World Cup in South Africa [in 2010] – the first time on the continent of Africa – and it was an amazing experience. I went to Brazil [in 2014] – again, an amazing experience. “Part of the World Cup is visiting places you’ve not had the chance to go to. I love travel and if there’s a trip to go somewhere to improve my knowledge of the world and culture, I’m the first name down.” Southgate is not blind to the social situation in Qatar. Far from it. Neither are his players, especially after they were given a presentation on it in the early part of last week. The midfielder Jordan Henderson described the content as “shocking” and “horrendous”. Writing in the Guardian last Thursday on the subject of migrant workers who have toiled to build the World Cup stadiums and supporting infrastructure, Nicholas McGeehan – a director of FairSquare Research and Projects – said there had been “thousands of deaths of young men in Qatar, significantly more than half of them unexplained. To that can be added millions of dollars of wage theft that have left workers and their families from some of the world’s poorest countries indebted and destitute.” The Qatar authorities can point to reforms and progress, including the removal of the kafala – or sponsorship – system under which workers were unable to change jobs without their employer’s permission, and the introduction of a new minimum wage. But Peter Frankental of Amnesty International has said: “New laws are only being patchily enforced and the fact remains that many migrant workers have suffered chronic overwork in Qatar or had their wages withheld by unscrupulous employers.” The LGBTQ+ community, represented by an international grouping of 16 organisations, wrote to Fifa and Qatar’s Supreme Organising Committee to make eight demands. They included explicit safety guarantees for World Cup attendees from the community, a clear welcome and the freedom of expression inside and outside stadiums. The SC has yet to respond. Its position is that everybody is welcome. How can Southgate and the other participants at this World Cup like no other strike the right tone? By knowing that they can still cherish it and hold nothing back on the pitch as long as they simultaneously do everything via their platforms to highlight injustice and drive change. England have earmarked the Souq Al Wakra hotel and the Al-Wakrah sports club to the south of Doha as their bases for glory. Five minutes apart from each other, the 101-room hotel that backs on to the beach is unprepossessing, certainly by comparison with some of the upmarket alternatives in the world’s richest per-capita country. The training ground, meanwhile, has a slightly old-school feel. It was established in 1959 and the trophy cabinet in the main building could have come from any clubhouse in England. Not that the playing surface looks anything less than pristine. Southgate is in this to win it. “What have we said to the team this week?” he said. “That if we can get to a semi-final, we can get to a final – which we did. And if we can get to a final, we can win.” The pathway is about to be revealed.",Sport/Football,In it to win it: Southgate dreams big as England await World Cup draw | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/31/gareth-southgate-england-world-cup-draw-dreams-big-qatar
4/1/2022,"Gordon Ramsay’s new show starts with him jumping out of a penis. It looks like a helicopter, but it’s a penis. This, apparently, is to show the participants in BBC One’s Gordon Ramsay’s Future Food Stars (hashtagged #FFS for social media, in case the smell of desperation hasn’t hit you yet) what he expects of them. They are on a beach, looking bemused, and they have to start the contest that will decide which of the up-and-coming food and drink entrepreneurs gets £150,000 of Ramsay investment by jumping off a Cornish cliff into the deep. Why? Because, barks Ramsay, “an idea is only as good as the person who has it and I want to discover your true DNA”. They do it. They can all swim, so it’s very boring. He doesn’t even push those who hesitate off. This is medium-well-done Ramsay; palatable, no raw emotion, as unobjectionable as possible. That’s the first 20 minutes gone. The remaining 40 are a little more interesting. The contestants are split into teams, given a £600 budget each, and told to come up with an idea for a food shack selling tasty yet portable food to the hungry folk of Newquay. Whoever turns the greatest profit in one lunchtime wins. Whoever turns the least profit – get this – loses, and one member of that team will be sent home. It’s The Apprentice with crabs. Which may also be The Apprentice, but let’s not dwell. The red team plump for a variety of tacos, including – at team member Vincenzo’s insistence – monkfish. “We’re at the seaside,” he says, as if that makes it a cheap, easy and appropriate foodstuff for a taco instead of MONKFISH. The blue team go for noodles and scallops, with a vegan option provided by Valentina who soon becomes magnificently furious with other members for disrespecting mushrooms. The green team opt for toasties. “What about something more interesting?” says Amit, who is more of a restaurateur than some. “No,” says Steph, who used to be in the navy. Or maybe that was Leah in the red team. As with The Apprentice, there are only two or three iterations of contestant model and trying to distinguish between individuals at this stage is like looking for a vehicle identification number on a car when you just need to know it’s a Volkswagen. Ramsay urges them all to work together and avoid conflict, which is funny for many reasons, and they head to their test kitchens before the big day. They make some test tacos, test toasties and test tnoodles. Opening day arrives and the race is on. The red team falls apart instantly, with Vincenzo abdicating all monkfish responsibility and leaving it to team member Bola to cook (for her first time ever) while he does the front of house. Which comprises taking customers’ cash and telling them, whenever they order the monkfish taco, that it was his idea. We do not warm to Vincenzo. Or as Asher, filling orders as fast as he can, puts it: “Just think it’s utter bollocks, to be honest.” Gordon’s “secret shoppers” denounce the noodles as “stodgy” and “with stuff just thrown on top”, but the punters don’t seem to mind – in fact, the blue team’s main problem is soon running out of ingredients – and Valentina seems to be on top of her previously murderous mushroom rage. The toastie queue is growing – less, it seems, out of popularity than team incompetence. The wait is ridiculous. “Forty minutes for a fucking toastie,” spits Gordon, unable to control himself as he prowls around looking at the insanity he hath semi-wrought. Afterwards, they gather in a darkened room to hear Gordon’s verdict. Noodles win. Tacos lose. Gordon calls the red team in one by one to a slightly smaller darkened room to play the disappointed headmaster and, ultimately, boot Vincenzo out. Possibly mainly for trying to defend himself with the words “I was a scared boy … now I am a man hungry.” It all feels tired, derivative (even if it is of Ramsay’s own stuff) and pointless. The producers have read the 2022 room well enough to know that viewers are unlikely to have the appetite for more rage than the world itself is offering right now, but of course the problem is that Gordon on the leash is even less fun than Gordon off the leash. It will fill a hole in the schedules, but, essentially, it’s an underspiced taco, a plain cheddar toastie or stodgy noodles with some stuff chucked on top.",Arts/Television & radio,"Gordon Ramsay’s Future Food Stars review – this underspiced cookery show is tired, derivative and pointless",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/31/gordon-ramsays-future-food-stars-review-this-underspiced-cookery-show-is-tired-derivative-and-pointless
4/1/2022,"Five sets of human fetal remains were recovered from the Washington DC home of an anti-abortion activist after a raid, the capital’s Metropolitan police department confirmed to the Guardian on Thursday. The activist, a woman named Lauren Handy, 28, is a leader of the group Progressive Anti-Abortion uprising (PAAU) and has described herself as a “Catholic anarchist” in the past. Local television station WUSA9 reported remains were carried out in red biohazard bags on Wednesday. Handy’s only comment at the time was: “People will freak out when they hear.” Although the authorities have not disclosed the source of the fetal remains, Handy recently claimed to have gained access to an organ bank at the University of Washington in Seattle. Separately, she was indicted on Wednesday for forcing entry into a Washington DC abortion clinic in 2020 October. “On March 9th myself & [sic] fellow activists gained access to University of Washington’s fetal organ labs & freezers,” Handy claimed on Twitter on 23 March. She also retweeted pictures posted by PAAU that show the contents of a walk-in deep freezer. The university said it plans to release a statement but would not confirm whether the pictures were authentic. It also said that university authorities were investigating whether anything was missing from the lab. On Wednesday, federal prosecutors indicted Handy on charges of blockading a Washington DC abortion clinic, where she allegedly claimed to be a patient to gain entry. She and eight co-defendants could face up to 11 years in prison and $350,000 in fines if found guilty. The news comes as conservative states across the country rush to limit women’s access to abortion, in anticipation of a forthcoming supreme court decision expected to severely curtail women’s right to terminate a pregnancy. Conversely, some Democratic-led states have worked to enshrine the right to abortion in state law. Current federal law requires states to allow abortion until a fetus can survive outside the womb, generally regarded as 24 weeks gestation, because of a decision in the 1973 landmark supreme court case Roe v Wade.",News/World news,"Five sets of fetal remains found in anti-abortion activist’s home, DC police say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/five-fetuses-found-anti-abortion-activists-home-dc
