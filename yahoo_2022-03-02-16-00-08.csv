3/2/2022,"Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) attempted to make Tuesday night’s State of the Union address all about herself—only to get booed by her colleagues as President Joe Biden solemnly talked about his son dying of cancer and military veterans suffering from burn pit exposure. Towards the end of his speech, the president turned his attention to an issue that has drawn bipartisan support and attention: increased care for soldiers who have suffered the effects of toxic exposure. As he announced his plans to provide health care and disability compensation for military members who’ve become ill due to breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits, Biden began explaining how this was a personal issue for him. “Many of you have been there. I've been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 times. These burn pits that incinerate waste, the waste of war, medical, and hazardous material, jet fuel, and so much more,” he stated. “And they come home, many of the world's fittest and best-trained warriors in the world, never the same. Headaches, numbness, dizziness. A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.” Here's the moment where Lauren Boebert was booed for shouting that Biden put soldiers in flag-draped coffins -- all while the president was talking about his veteran son dying of cancer and how it potentially could have been due to burn pits. pic.twitter.com/fJzsPwkQza — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) March 2, 2022 In a moment that went miles beyond GOP Rep. Joe Wilson’s notorious 2009 “you lie” outburst, Boebert shouted that Biden was the one who had put Americans into those flag-draped coffins. “You put them in, 13 of them,” she yelled, referencing the terror attack during last year’s chaotic Kabul withdrawal that left 13 American soldiers dead. Her outburst immediately drew loud jeers from Democratic lawmakers. Making the matter more cringeworthy, Boebert’s shouted comments came just as the president mentioned the death of his son, a military veteran. “I know. One of those soldiers was my son, Major Beau Biden,” the president continued. “I don't know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near-- that his hooch was near in Iraq and earlier than that in Kosovo is the cause of his brain cancer, the disease of so many other troops, but I am committed to find out everything we can.” He then began honoring affected soldiers and their families, who happened to be in attendance for the State of the Union. Elsewhere in the speech, Boebert and fellow MAGA troll Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)—who was also seen mouthing that Biden is “a fucking idiot” as the president spoke—attempted to get a “Build the wall!” chant going after the president praised border security, only to find no takers.

3/2/2022,"A mayor in Lithuania has a blunt message for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched an attack on Ukraine and is facing investigation for possible war crimes, including attacks on civilians. Remigijus Simasius, the mayor of Vilnius, the capital, and a team of volunteers painted “Putin, The Hague is waiting for you” in large block letters on a street just outside the Russian embassy, according to Reuters. A handout image provided by the mayor’s office to the news agency shows the stencil in place: The message comes as Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan of the International Criminal Court ― located in The Hague, in the Netherlands ― announced an investigation of Putin over potential war crimes. In one instance, Russia is accused of using fearsome thermobaric weapons, aka “vacuum bombs.” “If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week, adding that the U.S. has not yet confirmed use of the weapons. CNN reporters over the weekend said they spotted a thermobaric rocket launcher moving into position near the border. There are also multiple videos online of Russian strikes on civilian targets, and reports of deaths and injuries among civilians. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/2/2022,"By Mari Saito and Elaine Lies TOKYO (Reuters) -Keiichi Kurogi was one of dozens of men in Japan who offered to join an ""international legion"" to fight Russian invaders after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for volunteers. Kurogi, a 39-year-old office worker who lives in southwestern Japan, told Reuters he rang the Ukrainian embassy on Monday after seeing its plea for volunteers on Twitter. ""When I saw images of elderly men and women in Ukraine holding guns and going to the front, I felt I should go in their place,"" he said. The embassy declined Kurogi's offer to fight, telling him that he lacked the necessary military experience. As of Tuesday, 70 Japanese men - including 50 former members of Japan's Self-Defense Forces and two veterans of the French Foreign Legion - had applied to be volunteers, the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said, quoting a Tokyo company handling the volunteers. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Embassy acknowledged receiving calls from people ""wanting to fight for Ukraine,"" but declined to give further details. A Feb 28 social media post from the embassy thanked Japanese for their many inquiries about volunteering but added a proviso. ""Any candidates for this must have experience in Japan's Self-Defence Forces or have undergone specialised training,"" it said. In a new post on Twitter on Wednesday, the Ukrainian embassy in Japan said it was looking for volunteers with medical, IT, communication, or firefighting experience. It was not immediately clear if the volunteer positions were remote or involved travelling to Ukraine. Japan has told its nationals to put off travel to Ukraine for any reason, a warning reiterated on Wednesday by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, who said he was aware of the reports about the volunteers. ""The Japanese foreign ministry has issued an evacuation advisory for all of Ukraine and we want people to stop all travel to Ukraine, regardless of the purpose of their visit,"" he told a news conference. ""We are communicating with the Ukrainian embassy in Japan and pointed out that an evacuation advisory is in place."" Japan said on Wednesday it would temporarily close its embassy in Kyiv given increasing dangers in the capital. The war in Ukraine has stirred strong emotions in Japan, which has a post-war pacifist constitution that has been reinterpreted in recent years to allow Japan to only exercise collective self-defense or aid allies under attack. Hundreds gathered for a protest against the Russian invasion last week in Tokyo, while the Ukrainian embassy said it collected $17 million in donations from some 60,000 people in Japan after it put out an online request for help. As for Kurogi, he is adamant that he would volunteer again if Ukraine changed its requirements. ""I'm from a generation that does not know war at all,"" he said. ""It's not that I want to go to a war, it's more that I would rather go than see children forced to carry guns.""

3/2/2022,"On the night of President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union address, in which the president called for unity against both foreign and domestic threats, why would a fellow Democrat feel compelled to deliver a progressive response? Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib spoke on behalf of not the Democratic Party but the Working Families Party, in her post-SOTU comments. She was careful not to call it a rebuttal, but whatever you call it, it’s a slap at her party’s leader at a time when he is facing multiple crises, and the Democrats have the slimmest of margins in the House and Senate. Her remarks reprised the year-long arguments within the Democratic Party over the aspirations of the progressive agenda versus the inability to marshal the votes in the Senate. The congresswoman, a member of the leftist activist group in the House dubbed “The Squad,” didn’t name names— but she didn’t have to. Everyone knows who she means when she talks about “obstructionist Democrats” and “corporate-backed Democrats.” Crisis and Opportunity Could Lead to a Biden Bounce Very Soon Rep. Tlaib called on Biden to use his executive powers “now” to cancel student loan debt and regulate carbon emissions and fix labor rules. She rattled off a wish list that echoed a lot of what Biden had just called for in a Congress where chance of passage is zero, but where hope must be kept alive. “I am a lifelong Democrat, and I am also part of the Working Families Party,” the congresswoman said. “In the richest country in the world, it shouldn’t be this hard for so many to have a good life.” The Working Families Party is a voice for the multi-racial working class, and if they were in power, “we’d fight to get a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour,” Tlaib added. At a time when polls show voters think Biden is already too far left, Tlaib’s grabbing a State of the Union platform struck others in the party as self-destructive in the extreme. “Why does any Democrat at this moment think it’s a good idea to attack other Democrats on the night of the President’s State of the Union, it’s insane,” says Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic group. After Tlaib stepped forward to claim time, Texas Rep. Colin Allred said he would deliver a response for the Black Caucus, and the co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus also put in their bid to assess the evening, but It was Tlaib’s response that exposed old wounds and rankled Democrats. She spoke at the invitation of the Working Families Party, which promotes progressives and has become a player in New York state politics. It recently saw a silver lining in potential Democratic losses in the upcoming midterms, extolling the resulting “smaller but more progressive Democratic caucus.” “No Democrat should be allowed to actively cheer for Republican majorities and not be called on it,” says Bennett. With a three-vote margin in the House, caucus purity means handing power to a Republican Party enthralled by the cult of Trump. Democrats are looking at a potential blowout in November if they can’t reverse voters’ negative impressions of what they’ve accomplished since gaining control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Progressives are nursing a grudge over the Build Back Better bill. They supported a bipartisan infrastructure bill on the assurance that legislation would follow to address the climate crisis and boost the social safety net. That didn’t happen, and they blame moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema—as well as other centrists they call “corporate Democrats”—for supposedly misleading them. “They have the mistaken theory that standing up to Joe Biden is going to help them get what they want,” says Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution. “All it does is alienate all the Democrats they need to make friends of. It’s a wing of the party that wants to act out their fantasy.” For Kamarck and her longtime colleague, William Galston, this is Back to the Future. Thirty-three years ago, the duo issued a groundbreaking study on “The Politics of Evasion” that forced Democrats to confront a 30-year losing streak broken up only by Jimmy Carter’s single term victory, in 1976. Their analysis helped set the stage for Bill Clinton to find a governing agenda that could win nationally. Their new study, released last month, is titled, “The New Politics of Evasion: How Ignoring Swing Voters could reopen the door for Donald Trump and threaten American Democracy.” In it, they present compelling data that demographic changes portending a rise of progressive voters “overlook the sheer number of white non-college voters in key states.” Also, they point out that Hispanics vote more like non-college white voters than a minority group, which is why Democrats are losing ground with this fast growing part of the electorate. In Wisconsin, one of nine swing states they examined, 56 percent of the electorate is white and non-college, 30 percent is white and college-educated, 6 percent is Black, and 4 percent Hispanic. In 2020, the economic and social crisis created by COVID-19 brought enough of the white non-college voters back into the Democratic fold in key swing states. “But these successes must not blind Democrats to the fact that these voters often have found Republicans’ cultural claims more persuasive than the Democrats’ economic arguments,” they write. Democrats Can Salvage Biden’s Presidency With These Three Simple Moves They cite surveys that find only 7 percent of the electorate considers themselves “very liberal,” and only 9 percent identified with the policies associated with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “How the hell can they get anything accomplished for the people they serve with 9 percent? They live in a deep, deep blue bubble, and it causes them to do things that achieve the opposite result of what they want,” Kamarck told The Daily Beast. (For example, Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said Democrats lost a dozen seats because of “Defund the Police.”) “It makes me mad, as you can see,” Kamarck continued. “The problem is we’re known by our extremes. If [Tlaib] wants to run on the Working Families ticket, fine, but she ran as a Democrat.” In the piece they wrote 33 years ago, the cost of ducking the hard truths was getting a George H.W. Bush or a Bob Dole, says Kamarck. “Now the threat is getting a Donald Trump and the end of democracy.” For her part, Tlaib didn’t come to Congress to be a team player. She was one of six Democrats—all members of “The Squad”—who voted last year against the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The only Palestinian-American in Congress, she has made comments about Israel that have not landed well with her colleagues. Tlaib’s words Tuesday night were not nearly as inflammatory as was her display of disunity to a president beleaguered in part because he stood up for progressive legislation she supported that he couldn’t deliver, at least not yet.
