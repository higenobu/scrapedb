3/14/2022,"In response to John Crace’s sketch (Is Priti Patel vicious or stupid? It’s a fine line for Ukrainian refugees, 10 March), I would like to share my family’s experience of needless and extremely cruel suffering. I am a Ukrainian-born British citizen who would like to bring my family to stay with me in the UK. My family is my elderly mum, who is partially blind, my 11-year-old niece, and my cousin, who lived in Kyiv. The building where my mum lived was at the epicentre of heavy street fighting and an artillery blast. My cousin saved my mum’s life by pulling her out of the building at the very last moment. My relatives have had an extremely hard and long journey to the Polish border (almost 24 hours on a fully packed train). I met my family in Poland and we went to Warsaw to apply for a visa to the UK, as per guidance issued by the Home Office. The application requires all documents to be translated into English, which is not easy to do given the fact that you are not in the comfort of your home but in another country. We submitted the application and booked an appointment for biometrics on Monday 7 March. The biometrics have been done and we’re awaiting a decision on our application. Today is Sunday 13 March, and we still have no news. We do not know how long we will have to wait. No timescale was given due to the large number of applications. In the meantime, we need to stay somewhere and have something to eat. I feel so powerless and upset about the treatment of people who do not deserve this. I feel powerless for my mum, who is traumatised by the fact that she left her home with just one suitcase and left her life and possessions behind, and upset that we cannot even predict when we will be able obtain some kind of certainty. My family has nowhere else to go to. All I can ask is why we are treated in such a way.Name and address supplied  My wife’s Ukrainian family escaped from Kyiv, with shelling going on around them, and 24 hours later they were taken in by a Polish family in Warsaw. On Friday 4 March, the Home Office issued the “family application forms” at 1pm – and by 4pm I had filled in all three forms and submitted them. Following hours in front of a computer screen, I got appointments for 10am on Monday. By 2pm on Monday the interviews and biometrics were all completed. Since then, it has been with the Home Office’s “decision-making centre”, and as of Sunday afternoon there’s been no progress, according to the online tracker that I’ve been checking frequently. That’s nine days since the process started; four days with the Home Office – and this is a speeded-up service? Priti Patel’s announcement last Thursday that applicants could skip the biometric interview will not speed up anything at the UK end. When they do make a decision, there is then more admin at the Polish end. The whole approach to this humanitarian nightmare by the UK government, and in particular Priti Patel’s Home Office, has been nothing short of atrocious.Mike DarkensAshtead, Surrey  Last Tuesday I discovered that playing Jenga in the open air with a wind coming in from the Channel is difficult because the wind keeps blowing the bricks over. My opponent was a young man fleeing war in Sudan, who for many months – along with many hundreds of others – has been sleeping rough and playing a game of cat and mouse with the French authorities as he awaits his dream of getting to the UK. I think he would be somewhat bemused to hear of Ukrainians being offered food and shelter in Calais and the opportunity to apply for a visa for the UK in France. I like to think that his best self would not begrudge the Ukrainians what he so longs for, but, sitting in Calais, it feels very strange and not quite right.Rt Rev Mark BryantAssistant bishop, Diocese of Newcastle  My parents, Max and Gisela, met one another in the office of the Academic Assistance Council run by Esther Simpson (Unsung heroine who saved refugees from Nazis honoured in Leeds, 8 March). Considering Britain’s lamentable response to the refugees from Ukraine, perhaps now is not the time for modesty. Max arrived in Britain as a graduate student in 1936, became stateless when Germany invaded his native Austria, and was interned in 1940. He went on to found the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, whose scientists have won numerous Nobel prizes. He received the Nobel himself in 1962, and the Order of Merit from the Queen in 1988. The evidence from successive rounds of refugees arriving in the UK is clear: the Ukrainians will contribute hugely to this country, like the Kurds, the Hungarians and many others before them.Robin PerutzYork",News/World news,Our families fled the war in Ukraine.

3/14/2022,"The cannon effects in Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture – a bombastic adornment to a piece of music written for the 70th anniversary, in 1882, of the Battle of Borodino – are sending a wrong message in the light of the tragedy now unfolding in Ukraine (Cardiff orchestra defends move to cut Tchaikovsky from concert, 12 March) Furthermore, the finale of the overture, with the Marseillaise being triumphantly overpowered by the Russian national anthem, might have had a specific meaning in the Russian imperial context of the time, whereas the basic opposition between the “bad” French anthem and the “good” Russian one is now but a hollow symbol of Russian triumphalism, ill-suited to our times. It is important to bear in mind that Tchaikovsky wrote the piece to a commission; he did not like the finished work and, with justification, considered it of doubtful value. In comparison with the intense musical nationalism of the St Petersburg school of composers, Tchaikovsky was indeed an internationalist, though within Russia he could be as exclusively great-Russian as the rest of them. In summer 1865, staying at the country estate at Kamenka near Kyiv, he started collecting Ukrainian folk songs, intending to use them in his compositions, but soon gave up, finding them to have been “corrupted” by “western” (for which read Polish) influence. Theodor Adorno may have had a point that ethnic nationalism in music poisons it both socially and aesthetically, and in that regard the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra was right to remove The 1812 Overture from its programme. As one of the pieces replacing it, John Williams’s The Cowboy Overture sends a wrong message of a different kind. The piece may be good as film music, but in a concert hall its cliches become too obvious and reveal it as being no more than an example of mass-produced consumer music.Bojan BujicOxford  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/14/2022,"Doubling down on his vow to vote for Donald Trump if he is the Republican nominee in 2024 despite writing in his new book that Trump is dangerously unsuited for the job, William Barr said: “Elections are binary choice, and unfortunately sometimes it’s choosing the lesser of two evils.” Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump’s second attorney general added: “I believe that the progressive wing of the Democratic party is dangerous for the United States.” Barr also repeated that he would support another Republican if Trump does run in the primary again. In office, Barr was widely seen as too close to his hardline rightwing president, in particular over the Mueller report on Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. Differences over Trump’s lies about electoral fraud prompted Barr’s resignation, but not before he had used the Department of Justice to investigate such claims, a highly controversial move. In his new memoir, One Damned Thing After Another, Barr defends his record in office and some of Trump’s, on traditional conservative issues like crime and immigration. He told NBC: “I give him a lot of credit for identifying the key issues and having the gumption to press forward and accomplish a lot of good things … his combativeness worked for him in 2016 and partly while he was in office, breaking through the smothering hostility of the media. “But I tried to be balanced. I pointed out what I thought were his failings, and the fact that he went off the rails at the end.” Barr left office before, on 6 January 2021, supporters Trump told to “fight like hell” in support of his lies stormed the US Capitol. A bipartisan Senate report said seven deaths were connected to the riot. On NBC, Barr was asked if he “really think[s] the left in this country is somehow more dangerous than some issues around the world”? “No,” he said. “I just said in terms of the leadership of the country, I think they would be a dangerous choice for the United States.” He also said: “I think there are a lot of American people right now that might prefer having [Trump] back in office than what we see under Biden.” Trump is in legal jeopardy for his attempted electoral subversion as well as his business affairs but at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday night he hinted yet again at another White House run. Barr said he told Trump before his defeat by Biden that “his personal behavior, his obnoxious behavior” was turning voters off. “I felt for a long time that he was going to lose the election,” Barr said. “I went in in April and told him that I thought he was going to lose the election. On election night, I felt he was going to lose. And I was actually surprised it was as close as it was.” Biden beat Trump by more than 7m ballots in the popular vote and by 306-232 in the electoral college – a margin Trump called a landslide when it was in his favour over Hillary Clinton in 2016.",News/US news,Barr: Trump should not be president but ‘lesser of two evils’ compared to US left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/13/barr-trump-should-not-be-president-but-lesser-of-two-evils-compared-to-us-left
3/14/2022,"Andriy Yarmolenko broke down in tears after setting West Ham on their way to a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa on Sunday. The Ukrainian, who had not played in more than a month, scored the opening goal 18 minutes after coming off the bench and described the strain he has been under since the Russian invasion of his country. “It was so emotional for me,” he said. “It is so difficult for me right now in this moment thinking about football because every day the Russian army kills Ukrainian people.” Yarmolenko has been a peripheral presence at West Ham since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2018. But his entry was greeted with a supportive roar, and when he tucked a neat finish past Villa’s goalkeeper, Emiliano Martínez, he was surrounded by his teammates as he sank to his knees and wept. “To be honest I don’t know what to say,” he said. I just want to say thank you to my teammates, who support me all the time, every day. To West Ham fans, they also support me and Ukrainian people, and also to all British people, because we feel you support us. Thank you, really. I felt the support from the fans and I tried to give everything on the pitch because I know how important the game was for us today. I’m not ready for 100% because in the last two weeks I have trained maybe three or four times. “Since 26 February, I had to rest for four days because it was impossible to train – I was just thinking about my family and my people. I just tried to give everything on the pitch.” The West Ham manager, David Moyes, said: “He had time off as he was on the phone all the time, then he came in a little but three or four days over this period. He is grateful and appreciating the support. I spoke to him yesterday and he has family members in Ukraine and family here … and [the Polish goalkeeper Lukasz] Fabianski has been a really big help to him, regarding getting into Poland as well. So there has been a real team spirit, a real team effort behind the scenes.” With Michail Antonio joining Jarrod Bowen on the injured list, Yarmolenko may have a greater role to play for West Ham. “We have never doubted him as a footballer,” said Moyes. “He is really good, technically excellent and really pleased for him. The goal was important but the message more so.”",Sport/Football,West Ham’s Yarmolenko admits football ‘difficult’ given situation in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/west-ham-andriy-yarmolenko-admits-football-difficult-given-situation-ukraine-aston-villa
3/14/2022,"A Russian Orthodox church in Amsterdam has announced it is to split with the Moscow patriarchate in the first known instance of a western-based church cutting ties over the invasion of Ukraine. “The clergy unanimously announced that it is no longer possible for them to function within the Moscow patriarchate and provide a spiritually safe environment for our faithful,” the clergy said in a statement posted on its website. “This decision is extremely painful and difficult for all concerned.” The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, a trusted ally of President Vladimir Putin, has declined to condemn Kremlin’s decision to invade its neighbour, referring to Russia’s opponents in Ukraine as “evil forces.” In a Sunday sermon last week he also said gay pride parades organised in the West were part of the reason for the war in Ukraine. The statement said the Russian Orthodox parish of Saint Nicholas of Myra had asked the Russian archbishop of the diocese of the Netherlands who is based in The Hague to grant the church “canonical dismissal.” The clergy of the parish said they had requested to join the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Istanbul-based Orthodox branch, seen as a rival to the Russian Orthodox Church. Kirill’s position on the war has led to unease among some Russian Orthodox priests who object to the invasion of a country often referred to as a “brotherly nation” in religious circles. More than 280 Russian Orthodox priests and church officials from around the world have signed an open letter expressing their opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It warned that “eternal torment” awaits those who give “murderous orders.” The Russian Orthodox Church in Amsterdam, which consists of four priests and a deacon – one of the biggest Russian Orthodox congregations in Holland – has been critical of Russia’s role in the war since the start of the invasion on 24 February. It said last week it would no longer mention the name of Patriarch Kirill in their liturgy because of his backing for the invasion of Ukraine. “We as the clergy of St. Nicholas parish in Amsterdam have expressed our shock at the invasion of Ukraine by the armed forces of the Russian Federation … We distance ourselves from Patriarch Kirill’s narrative,” it wrote on its Facebook page. The statement went against the official policy of the Russian Orthodox Church not to use the word “war” and “invasion” to describe Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The Russian priests in Amsterdam told the Dutch outlet ND that Archbishop Elisey of the Netherlands visited their church after, warning that “Moscow was watching their actions closely.” The Amsterdam church held a closed session on Sunday in which the head of the parish reiterated the decision to break with Moscow. “We asked our former Patriarch Kirill to stop the war. Unfortunately, this did not happen,” he said in a video address posted on the church’s YouTube page. A Russian member of the church’s choir who was standing outside the told the Guardian she supported the decision to separate from Moscow. “Once the war started, there was only one way out of this,” she said, asking not to give her name. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also been criticised by other Christian religious leaders, including the head of Patriarchate of Constantinople, Bartholomew I of Constantinople and Pope Francis, who on Sunday issued his toughest condemnation yet of the invasion of Ukraine, saying the “unacceptable armed aggression” must stop. Bartholomew, considered to be the spiritual leader of the world’s Eastern Orthodox Christians, earlier said that Putin had committed “a great injustice” by going to war against his “coreligionists,” and “has earned the hatred of the whole world.” In 2018, The Russian Orthodox Church cut ties with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, seen as the spiritual authority of the world’s Orthodox Christians, after Bartholomew granted independence to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which was previously under Moscow’s control. “In the name of God, I ask you: stop this massacre,” the pope said addressing during his Sunday service in the Vatican.",News/World news,Russian Orthodox church in Amsterdam announces split with Moscow ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/russian-orthodox-church-in-amsterdam-announces-split-with-moscow
3/14/2022,"Forty years ago, the BBC broadcast a documentary series titled Police. In the most influential episode, the pioneering director Roger Graef, who sadly died this month, filmed three bullying male detectives interviewing a distressed rape victim in Reading police station. The footage caused a sensation. The furore led directly to tighter rape questioning guidelines. Four decades on, not enough has changed in British policing. A month ago, Dame Cressida Dick resigned after the revelation that 14 Metropolitan police officers had been sharing misogynistic and racist messages for at least two years. Since Sarah Everard’s murder a year ago, trust in the police has fallen to record low levels; a majority now lack confidence in them to deal with crime in their local area. A high court ruling on Friday against the Met over its efforts to cancel a vigil for Ms Everard shows the yawning sensibility gap between the force and the public. Last week, two new reports underscored the unprecedented seriousness of this crisis. The first, the result of a comprehensive review chaired by Sir Michael Barber for the independent Police Foundation, warned that policing in Britain is at a crossroads. In what amounts to a red alert for public order, it said that, without urgent change, the principle of policing by consent that has defined this country’s policing for decades risks being destroyed. The Barber team published 56 interconnected recommendations for reform, not just to police culture, but also to training, skills and organisational structure. Two days later, the chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales echoed several of the same things. After a decade in post, Sir Tom Winsor ended his final review by saying there remain major shortcomings in British policing, that problems must not be underestimated, and that they are not confined to London. He told the 43 forces of England and Wales that they must operate as a unified network to become fitter for purpose. He warned that the current recruitment of 20,000 new officers risks hiring too many of the same kind of people who have done such reputational damage to the service. The reports are complementary. Both grasp the urgency for change. Both stress the neglected primacy of crime prevention. Both see neighbourhood policing, abjectly downgraded in many areas, as the bedrock of public confidence. Both say more spending and better training are essential. Both call for a change in police governance. Both stress the revolution in online crime. Sir Tom’s warning that children are now in greater danger in their bedrooms than in the streets is chilling. Yet very little in the two reports is categorically new. Britain’s modern policing system has faced repeated calls for reform, most powerfully after the 1981 riots and the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence. The issues have often been variations on the same themes: mistreatment of women, racism, police culture, unnecessary violence, complaints handling, structures and accountability. Although there have been periods of reform and progress, they have not been maintained and have sometimes even gone into reverse, as at present. A bigger and more lasting reform is therefore needed. But it is hard to see the Home Office, with its shattered departmental reputation and its obsession with immigration control, being capable of delivering it. It is inconceivable that the home secretary, Priti Patel, is capable of leading such a process either. Pending the election of a different government, the onus rests on the rising generation of police chiefs, College of Policing managers and local community leaders to do what they can to prepare the ground. The urgency, though, is beyond doubt. The stakes, as the Police Foundation report confirms, could hardly be higher.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on police reform: a national imperative | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/13/the-guardian-view-on-police-reform-a-national-imperative
3/14/2022,"Slugs and snails regularly appear on lists of the most irritating garden pests; only last year the Royal Horticultural Society noted they had slid to the top after a few seasons hiding near the bottom. But the RHS this month announced that it will no longer consider them as pests. In fact, all invertebrates, usually felt to interfere with gardeners’ best-laid plans, will be celebrated. Coincidentally, scientists also argued last week that British wildflowers named in the 1959 Weeds Act as injurious – and therefore subject to compulsory control – should be allowed, within reason, to thrive. The reasons for both changes of heart are similar. Slugs and snails are an important part of a garden’s ecosystem, eating dead leaves, for instance, or being eaten by hedgehogs, toads and birds. Earwigs, wrens and dunnocks eat aphids; blue tits time breeding so that their young will find plenty of caterpillars. As for the injurious weeds, three of the five most feared (ragwort, creeping thistle, spear thistle) turn out to be far more popular with pollinators than those recommended by Defra. How we choose to view (and name) the world determines in some important ways how we react to it. Calling slugs and snails pests is permission to capture and destroy; as for weeds, councils spend £10m eradicating them yearly. This may be in the service of human ideas of beauty or perfection or, more complicatedly, about producing food. But the result is the same. Gardens are the oldest of metaphors. “Adam was a gardener”, as Kipling noted in his bouncy The Glory of the Garden, which extols all garden work, even “If it’s only netting strawberries or killing slugs on borders”. A darker iteration of the idea occurs in the work of the late philosopher Zygmunt Bauman. He posited the “gardening state”, whereby government finds optimum conditions for some, and ejects those deemed less useful or too wild. With such a framing, Bauman was wittingly undermining the idea that rational methods based on scientific knowledge would create optimal conditions. There is now an acceptance that nature is too complex a system to be wholly tamed. There are too many interdependencies to tamper with abandon. Our ecological future depends on diversity and that requires a more relaxed approach, leading to a rewilding movement in private gardens. Gastropods remain mostly a mystery. Of those species we know about, wrote the RHS’s Andrew Salisbury in the Guardian, “only nine of the 44 – that’s a fifth – are likely to be nibbling holes in your hosta, latching on to lettuce or burrowing into a potato”. Labelling all slugs and snails as pests militates against adopting a more harmonious view of them. “What would the world be, once bereft,” as the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins put it, “of wet and of wildness? Let them be left ... Long live the weeds and the wilderness yet.” But there should be enough humility to recognise that choices will still be made about which flowers should grow, which slugs can be let loose and which trees should flourish. Wildness is, for some time, likely to be organised lightly – so as not to spring a nasty surprise.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on slugs and snails: what’s in a name?

3/14/2022,"Ministers have been accused of “turning off the headlights at the first sign of dawn” after scrapping nationwide Covid surveillance programmes, with scientists saying it will almost certainly end up costing more money in the long run. Last week, scientists announced that the React study – which randomly tests about 150,000 people across England each month to see how many are infected with coronavirus – will be scrapped at the end of March, and no further data will be collected beyond that point. Funding is also being withdrawn from the Zoe covid symptom study, the Siren and Vivaldi studies (which monitor infections in health workers and care homes) and the CoMix social contacts survey, while mass free testing is due to end on 1 April. The Office for National Statistics’ Covid infection survey, which regularly samples the same 180,000 people to estimate what percentage of the UK populations is infected, will continue. It comes as growing numbers of new infections in multiple countries led one expert to prompt speculation that Europe could be at the start of a sixth wave of Covid infections, partly driven by the “stealth” BA.2 Omicron variant. Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said the decisions on Covid surveillance would slow the country’s ability to respond and adjust to future waves or surges of infection, making the current reliance on emergency booster programmes progressively less viable, and were at best “shortsighted”. Griffin said: “At worst, it is symptomatic of a policy-driven movement to ignore the fact that the pandemic is not over, and that we remain in a highly dynamic situation with respect to immunity versus infection and virus evolution. This is about as far from ‘following the science’ as you can get. “Losing these programmes will almost certainly end up costing more in terms of disruption than saved. It is a false economy, and yet another example of short-term thinking.” Stephen Reicher, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews, said the decisions made no sense on public safety or public health grounds. “It is like turning off the headlights at the first sign of dawn. You can’t see what’s coming and you don’t know when it makes sense to turn them on again,” he said. Earlier this month, the government announced that its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) would no longer regularly meet to discuss coronavirus. Reicher, who sat on the Sage behavioural science subcommittee, said the decision to stop funding these surveillance studies was “far more significant than standing down Sage”. He said: “Those scientists are still working and can reconvene quickly. But how can they work – or know if they need to reconvene – if the data isn’t there?” The ending of free mass testing on 1 April could make the situation even worse. “Johnson’s insistence that ‘tests will be available for anybody to buy’ completely misses the point,” said Dr Kit Yates, a mathematical biologist at the University of Bath. “Many people in the UK will not be in the position to spend a significant portion of their budget on testing each week. Others will simply be put off by the cost. “The consequence will be that testing drops significantly, people become less aware when they are infectious, and consequently less able to take the ‘personal responsibility’ that the government has been highlighting so vociferously in the aftermath of their removal of other Covid mitigations.” According to the latest ONS figures, the percentage of people estimated to have tested positive for coronavirus rose in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the week ending 5 March, while the percentage of infections compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant also increased across all countries. Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and many other European countries have also seen a sharp increase in daily confirmed cases since the start of March. Dr Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, US, said the uptick could mark the beginning of a sixth wave of Covid infections in Europe, driven by a combination of the BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron variants and the relaxation of restrictions in many countries. Topol said: “There are definitive signs of a new wave starting throughout many countries in Europe, some of which also are also showing increases in Covid hospitalisations. It is hard, at this point, to determine if the cause is reducing or eliminating restrictions, BA.2’s higher rate of transmission, or waning of immune protection from vaccines. “Right now is the last time that countries like the UK and US should be cutting funding or abandoning any surveillance and testing measures. As much as we all would like it to be, the pandemic is far from over.”",News/World news,‘Pandemic is not over’: ministers criticised for scrapping UK Covid surveillance,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/pandemic-is-not-over-ministers-criticised-after-scrapping-uk-covid-surveillance

3/14/2022,"Songwriters such as Ed Sheeran face a future of drawn out legal battles because the way in which people consume music has changed so much in the past half a century, a leading legal expert has warned, as she urged courts to reconsider how they interpret copyright law. The rise of streaming on platforms such as Spotify and YouTube, combined with larger teams of writers behind hit songs, have led to a surge in high-profile copyright infringement cases in the past few years. Most recently, Sheeran is locked in an ongoing legal battle over Shape of You, Spotify’s most streamed song ever. Hayleigh Bosher, associate dean of intellectual property law at Brunel University, who researches the music industry, said “the law needs to move with the times” as “making music is so different to how it was 50 years ago”. She added: If Sheeran loses, I imagine we will see even more cases. I don’t think copyright is doing its job properly if songwriters are afraid, that’s stifling creativity.” Determining whether an artist has copied another songwriter is based on two tests. Firstly, whether they are likely to have heard the song before writing their piece, and secondly whether they have substantially lifted a section of it. Bosher said a 2019 ruling in the US against Katy Perry, which was overturned this month on the grounds the melody in question was not “unique or rare”, had been a landmark case. It raised questions about how courts establish whether writers have heard a track. The judge had determined that Perry was likely to have heard the complainants’ track Joyful Noise, given it had an average 633,333 listens across six YouTube videos. “That number was relatively low when you think about how much content is available online. Saying something is on Spotify or YouTube means nothing, there’s hours and hours of music, it doesn’t mean anyone would have heard it,” Bosher said. In Sheeran’s case, his lawyers told the UK high court that the singer and his cowriters do not recall having heard the song Oh Why by Sami Switch – real name Sami Chokri – who alleges he must have encountered it since both songs appeared on YouTube channel SBTV at a similar time. Bosher noted that it was unusual in Sheeran’s case that Chokri’s lawyers had raised Sheeran’s earlier settlements, for example with R&B girl group TLC over Shape of You’s similarity to their 1990s hit No Scrubs, as evidence that he copied other artists – since this could simply have been to avoid a protracted legal battle. She suggested this may indicate Sheeran wants to avoid opening the floodgates to future cases. The second test is also problematic since so much music is produced now, and pop songs rely on familiar frameworks and simple, catchy melodies, making accidental copies more likely than in other branches of the arts, Bosher said. The musicologists she works with report high demand for their services, as songwriters are anxious to ensure their songs show evidence of “a personal stamp” to protect them. Songwriting teams are also getting much bigger, making it difficult to track influences, said Tom Gray, a songwriter and member of Gomez who is chair of the Ivors Academy, which represents music writers. “It’s always been part of the fabric of songwriting, because when you hear a piece of melody, it gets stuck in your head and you’re like, ‘What have I nicked?’” He added that this has been exacerbated by pressure on songwriters from record companies to write songs that imitate other hits, enabling them to be more easily picked up by Spotify’s algorithms. Gray thought that recent cases, such as those involving Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines, indicated a shift in how courts interpreted copyright, from focusing on identical melodies to harmonic similarities that suggested “they’d stolen the vibe of a track”. Naomi Pohl, the general secretary of the Musician’s Union, said the recent surge in copyright cases against the world’s most successful pop musicians reflects how imbalanced the industry has become. Most smaller scale songwriters have suffered falls in revenue due to the shift towards streaming, just as top stars are selling back catalogues for millions of pounds, she said. “There’s a lot of money involved so there’s big incentives.”",Arts/Music,"‘Music is so different now’: Copyright laws need to change, says legal expert",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/13/music-is-so-different-now-copyright-laws-need-to-change-says-legal-expert
3/14/2022,"A day after the horrific bombing of a Ukrainian maternity hospital, visitors to the Mayfair offices of the Russian-owned auction house Phillips could not help but wonder if an event preview seemed subdued. “It did feel quiet,” said one attender at the preview, where viewers sipped espressos as vintage German-made Lange watches, labelled with six-figure prices in dollars and Swiss francs, lay behind display cases for an exhibition next month. The event – and forthcoming auctions – will also be a litmus test of feeling towards Phillips, which insists it is “business as usual” in the face of a boycott by respected figures in the art world. Despite it donating £5.8m to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society from a recent auction in London, and its CEO condemning the Russian invasion, those calling for the company to be shunned argue that only a boycott will force its Russian business figures – such as its owners Leonid Friedland and Leonid Strunin – to put pressure on the Kremlin. “They provided the donation but it’s really not back to business as usual, and I think buyers and consignors should take their business elsewhere. I don’t think that anyone should be dealing with Russian or Russian-owned companies at the moment,” said Andy Hall, an art collector and philanthropist. “Russia is so centralised and repressed that anyone who is in the economic and cultural elite in that country is, in a way, complicit with the current regime,” he added, likening the situation to firms based in Nazi Germany and the boycotts that sought to freeze out South African-controlled businesses in the Apartheid era. Friedland and Strunin, who are not subject to any sanctions, list their addresses on Companies House as the Berkeley Square headquarters of Phillips, which was acquired in 2008 by their Russian luxury goods company, Mercury Group. The 226-year-old auction house ranks behind only Sotheby’s and Christie’s as one of the sector’s major international players, and now markets itself as “the world’s most dynamic and forward-thinking auction house”, with inroads in new markets such as non-fungible token (NFTs). It has stood alongside Chelsea as one of the jewels in the crown of Russian investments in “Londongrad”. As with the football club, critics such as Hall believe Phillips’ ties with Russia should now be severed. Aside from its owners – referred to in the art world as “the two Leonids” – the other most visible Russian in the British art world is Peter Aven, a UK-based oligarch who stepped down from a London-based investment conglomerate and a prestigious Royal Academy position after he and other oligarchs were hit by EU sanctions. In the UK, where Aven has a home in Surrey, he has previously been happy to speak about and showcase a range of valuable art assets. On 8.5 acres of green lawns, they include open air sculptures such as Henry Moore’s Reclining Figure, bought for £19m, Lynn Chadwick’s Sitting Couple, a Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, and a specially commissioned Antony Gormley. In a Financial Times interview in 2017, Aven identified his favourite piece as Les Maisonettes Rouges by Marc Chagall, bought for a recorded £3.3m. “I never bought a plane or a yacht. All my money goes into art,” he said. While last month’s EU sanctions led to the French government seizing a yacht belonging to another oligarch, Igor Sechin, Aven’s work does not appear to be at risk of being confiscated by the UK government – at least for now. But away from high-profile billionaire Russians, a chill wind of uncertainty is also being felt lower down the economic ladder by a much larger cohort of Russian art lovers in London, who used a now-axed golden visa scheme allowing wealthy foreign investors a fast track to live in the UK. “The billionaires obviously came but then they brought a next wave, including those who worked with and for them – as well as others who came simply because they could,” said one concerned Russian whose business is part of a network of advisories and consultancies catering for compatriots’ needs on schooling, property and culture. “I have no idea if they will stay, to be honest, and it is very worrying. People take note of the Conservative MP who said that everyone who is Russian should be sent back and another who suggested Russian deposits should be limited to £50,000.” They added: “The collectors of art are rare in any group but it might be a higher percentage among this group because they have the means, the time and also the interest and incentive. Some buy art but many others go to exhibitions or become patrons – and it’s maybe higher than your normal new London intake – and they use it to get acquainted culturally here.” While many tended to have traditional tastes, the same source said it was particularly sad as sanctions on Russia, and the clampdown on the movement of money, would halt a growing trend towards collecting and preserving more recent Russian art and history. “It’s upsetting because it’s a step towards changing the culture, too. Moscow was literally springing back to life, with new galleries and glimpses of hope. Now those new projects are frozen and nothing can be taken out of Russia.” Stephen Brooks, the CEO of Phillips, said earlier this month: “We at Phillips unequivocally condemn the invasion of Ukraine. Along with the rest of the art world, we have been shocked and saddened by the tragic events unfolding in the region. We call for an immediate cessation of all hostilities in the strongest possible terms.” The watch firm Lange and Peter Aven’s investment firm have been approached for comment.",News/World news,Russian-owned auction house faces boycott by art world figures,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/russian-owned-auction-house-faces-boycott-by-art-world-figures
3/14/2022,"A woman who was repeatedly sexually assaulted and harassed by a former Labour MP is considering suing the House of Commons for failing to ringfence money that could cover her compensation. Woman A was victimised after spurning the advances of Mike Hill, the former MP for Hartlepool, an employment tribunal ruled in July. An ally of Jeremy Corbyn, he was found to have climbed into the victim’s bed and sexually assaulted her in his parliamentary office. On Thursday her barrister, Suzanne McKie QC, told a remedy hearing that nearly all of the £250,000 insurance policy that the Commons had put in place to cover an MP facing an employment claim had been spent on Hill’s legal fees. McKie told the hearing that the Commons bore responsibility for failing to keep some money for her client’s legal costs and compensation. “Ms A now has to consider how to effect judgment against Mr Hill when there is almost nothing left in that pot of money, and whether to sue the House of Commons for failing to put in place a sufficiently protective policy,” McKie told the hearing. Woman A, who spoke to the tribunal under oath, said: “The insurance policy which covers MPs’ misconduct as employers is capped at £250,000, which includes defence costs as well as compensation for the victim. Mr Hill has deliberately pursued a hopeless case, reducing what’s available to me to very little. “They had plenty of opportunity to settle this case, which was a hopeless case and which they knew they would not win. This has destroyed me, and they have taken four and a half years of my life, and I’m left with nothing and no hope.” In July a central London tribunal found that Hill had marginalised Woman A in parliament, changed her terms and conditions of employment, and made her redundant after she rejected his advances. Hill’s case has been funded by the taxpayer because of an insurance policy offered to all MPs, while Ms A’s has been funded in part through a crowdfunding campaign. McKie, who is acting pro bono, told Thursday’s hearing that MPs were covered by a £5m insurance policy if they were sued for libel or slander, but by a £250,000 policy if an employee claimed sexual harassment. She said: “The £5m insurance policy for MPs does not apply to deliberate acts, which must include sexual harassment and misconduct. The alternative insurance policy which does apply, the employment practices policy, is capped at £250k and includes defence costs as well as any amount for compensation.” The fact that the policy does not ringfence money and can be exhausted on legal fees was raised by McKie, who implied that this could be a factor in other high-profile cases. “This is an important point, given matters aired in the press in the last few days related to misconduct in the House of Commons,” she said. Last week an independent inquiry found that the former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow was a “serial bully” and liar, which could leave the Commons open to claims of compensation. The hearing on Thursday was asked by Woman A’s legal team to make a recommendation that the House of Commons in future provides insurance policies that ringfence compensation for victims of harassment, misconduct and sexual assault. This is so that most of the moneys within the policy are available for compensation and cannot be used up on the legal fees of the MP, the barrister said. Hill, who was then married, conducted a campaign of sexual harassment and bullying against Woman A over a 16-month period in 2017 and 2018, according to a reserved judgment. He was in breach of the Equalities Act in subjecting the claimant “to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature”. The breaches included a telephone call on the evening of 22 September 2017 in which he told the claimant he loved her; “getting into bed with the claimant on 11 December 2017 and rubbing his erection against her”; and “sexual assaults on occasions at the Westminster office”. He was also found to have victimised her with behaviour that included deactivating her security pass, ignoring her work-related text and emails, and terminating the claimant’s employment while stating he would put notice on the flat they shared in a text message. Hill resigned as a Labour MP in March 2021, resulting in a May byelection in Hartlepool and a victory for the Conservatives. The remedies judgment was reserved on Friday. A House of Commons spokesperson said: “The House of Commons covers the cost of liability insurance to cover members for claims made against them by employees. Providing a single policy covering all MPs is more cost-effective to the taxpayer. How any claim is resolved would be a matter for the insurer and we cannot comment on individual cases.”",News/Politics,Woman in Mike Hill case may sue Commons over compensation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/13/woman-in-mike-hill-case-may-sue-commons-over-compensation
