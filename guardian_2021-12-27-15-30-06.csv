12/27/2021," There is no such thing as too much Mr Lycett at Christmas, so here is Joe again – this time as the new Travel Man, replacing Richard Ayoade after nine seasons and several Christmas specials. A four-day trip – twice the usual length – around Iceland with Bill Bailey requires a bumper itinerary that includes visiting a punk museum in a disused public toilet, taking a dip in a geothermal “nature bath”, flying in a plane across Iceland’s longest fjord and having a go at husky sledding. Hollie Richardson The talent show for teenyboppers returns. Sporty Spice herself, Melanie C, joins the McFly guitarist Danny Jones, will.i.am and Pixie Lott on the judging panel. The three‑part competition will continue tomorrow and Wednesday. HR Nervously serving up posh festive grub to the critics Grace Dent, Jimi Famurewa and Jay Rayner are the 2020 finalists Philli Armitage-Mattin, Santosh Shah and Bart van der Lee, plus the runner-up from 2017’s series, Jamie Park. Jack Seale Comedy couple Lucy Beaumont and Jon Richardson – the stars of their own sitcom, Meet the Richardsons – attempt to brighten up the lull between Christmas and New Year with this one‑off get-together with their closest pals. Joining them for a boozy feast is Roisin Conaty, along with the inescapable Romesh Ranganathan and Rob Beckett. HR Clarice has the unenviable task of following up one of cinema’s most highly regarded horror films, The Silence of the Lambs. A year after the film’s events, Clarice Starling (Pretty Little Liars’ Rebecca Breeds) is struggling to handle her newfound notoriety within the FBI when a grizzly killer strikes. Sometimes schlocky, but undeniably moreish. Henry Wong Season 11 of Larry David’s acidic comedy of ill manners dropped hints that it might be the equivalent of an origin story as the moneyed curmudgeon successfully sold a lucrative streaming series about his formative years. But, as the season concludes, any self-reflection on Larry’s part has been in short supply. Graeme Virtue West Side Story (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins, 1961), 4.35pm, BBC TwoSteven Spielberg’s take on the stage musical is in cinemas now, but you could do worse than stay on the sofa for Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins’ Oscar-laden 1961 version. In this Romeo and Juliet tale updated to mid-50s New York, Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood may not be the most vital of leads (Jimmy Bryant and Marni Nixon were employed as their “ghost singers”), but with support from George Chakiris and Rita Moreno, and a rollcall of jazzy numbers from Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, it is the swingiest thing.

12/27/2021,"It has been a hell of a year, emphasis on the hell. Yet among all the sadness (and numerous revelations of Number 10 parties), there’s also been an array of uplifting, engrossing and fantastically strange television moments this year. Here are some of our favourites.  The moment in question. Alison’s reaction made it pic.twitter.com/Xe5Zd3D07b There were so many surreal, life-affirming clangers on This Morning in 2021. Presenter Josie Gibson hilariously fell into a lake and was dragged out live on air. Alison Hammond set herself up for a fall by asking Graham Norton whether his lovely dog was still alive (“no … dead,” Norton responded.) But the best was Barry Humphries mistakenly congratulating Dermot O’Leary – instead of Phillip Schofield – for coming out of the closet. Largely thanks to Alison Hammond’s hysterical laughter. This year saw the most diverse Strictly ever. While John and Johannes received widespread praise and proved that a same-sex partnership could actually enhance the show (rather than, as naysayers suggested, distract from it), it was the eventual winners Rose and her partner Giovanni who captured our hearts. In a Strictly dance that will be remembered for years to come, Rose and Giovanni continued to move as the song faded away, as a tribute to deaf people. “There’s so many things that Rose’s win symbolises for Deaf people like myself,” journalist Liam O’Dell told BBC News. “It goes to show how, with the right support, Deaf people can achieve anything.” Usually for the best innuendoes you only have to switch on Bake Off. Yet it was Clare Balding who provided the best double entendre of the year, while presenting the BBC’s Olympic coverage. Having just congratulated Matt Richards and Tom Dean for their gold medal in the 4x200 metre freestyle at the start of an interview, she enthusiastically noted that Matt’s “third leg was just phenomenal.” Their faces said it all. To many adults, he was noted as the first BBC children’s presenter who has Down’s syndrome. To children watching, he is simply a bubbly and engaging presenter called George. His debut on CBeebies received widespread praise and was seen as a step forward for disability representation on television, but it was also the lack of special treatment George received that was celebrated. After his introduction, he merely told us about his fondness for cooking and his love of dancing. “I’m always super positive and always smiley and bubbly. I’m loving life,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “There’s nothing stopping me.” Of all of the devastating moments in It’s A Sin, Russell T Davies’s blistering drama exploring the HIV/Aids epidemic in the UK in the 1980s, it was the unexpected death of the sweet, innocent Colin (Callum Scott Howells) that stuck with many viewers. Full of the joy of the big, bright city, so excited by finding his first set of LGBTQ+ friends, Colin’s death was a reminder that being HIV positive was not a result of a promiscuous lifestyle. And the way he was treated when he became ill? Inhumane. Left isolated and abandoned in a locked ward, while his mother received hate and abuse in the mail. And yet, throughout all this, his friends fought to get him out of the ward. And his mother loved him, unconditionally. La! In a television first, the second series of the much-loved Apple TV+ sitcom Ted Lasso somehow managed to Rickroll everyone watching. In the middle of a eulogy, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) was unable to think up words to describe her father, so instead read aloud the lyrics of Never Gonna Give You Up to a packed church. And what did Rick Astley think? “I was completely blown away with what they did.” Good evening, Prime Minister! 👀🤭@antanddec #ImACeleb pic.twitter.com/cekIFiwx8N Of all the things to have happened this year, Ant and Dec becoming a potent force for political resistance was certainly one of the most unexpected. After allegations of a Christmas party being held at 10 Downing Street during severe restrictions back in 2020, Ant and Dec captured the mood of the nation by using events taking place within the I’m A Celebrity camp to brilliantly mock Boris Johnson. “EVENING PRIME MINISTER … for now,” warned Declan Donnelly. OH MY GOD EMMA THOMPSON #AnAudienceWithAdele pic.twitter.com/uMC2Tq5jAv An Audience with Adele, an ITV special featuring the singer performing songs from her latest album to a room packed with celebrities, featured many surreal moments. There was Bryan Cranston with his eyes closed losing himself to Something Like You. There was Alan Carr, drafted in to perform Make You Feel My Love, in front of Samuel L Jackson and Harry Hill. But the most surreal was seeing Emma Thompson completely losing it to Rolling in the Deep, apparently researching a new role: relative at a wedding disco, after one too many gins. In a feat that can only be described as “Peak Andrew Scott”, the Sunday night BBC One drama The Pursuit of Love featured him, as the character Lord Merlin, entering a room to T. Rex, waltzing around in sexy pyjamas, necking champagne then proceeding to make out with whoever offered themselves. If only, if only, more period dramas were like this. Essentially a corporate Red Wedding, the show generated a thousand memes with the scene where Roman, Shiv and Kendall unexpectedly console each other after a monumental twist and downfall. Not only did it wrongfoot its viewers with a storyline that no one – including its characters – saw coming, its masterstroke was that we should have. After all, they’d teased it with a promotional image released weeks ahead of the third season actually airing. The three series-long will they/won’t they dynamic of Sophie (Natasia Demetriou) and Al (Alastair Roberts) was so unbelievably sweet that there was only one way they could finally get together: in the shyest way possible. One of the most adorably understated, heartwarming moments of television in 2021. The BBC News theme like you've never heard it before! 🤯Performed by #BBCBreakfast's @OwainWynEvans and 50 fellow drummers for his MAMMOTH 24-hour #Drumathon. 🥁Send us your pics & videos of you joining in Owain's Big Bang 📸 Show your support at https://t.co/gh0W5jM8bz pic.twitter.com/RwyeFdfYi0 In the early days of the first 2020 lockdown, the immaculately dressed BBC weatherman Owain Wyn Evans went viral for performing the BBC News theme on his own drum kit. A surreal but uplifting orchestra of musicians playing the theme on the actual BBC News channel soon followed. But it reached its climax with more than 50 drummers playing the theme, as part of a 24-hour drumathon to raise money for Children in Need.

12/27/2021," Dan Brown’s 2003 thriller earned censure from some corners of the church for its alternative religious history and its depictions of Mary Magdalene and Jesus. That hasn’t stopped its success: after the big-budget Hollywood film, we will now see the first stage adaptation, with Nigel Harman playing Robert Langdon, the Harvard professor of religious symbology, and Hannah Rose Caton as police cryptologist, Sophie Neveu. Churchill theatre, Bromley, 10-15 January, then touring until 12 November Robert Icke’s production of George Orwell’s classic political satire will be led by puppets of 33 life-size animals. The allegory of revolution and its aftermath is adapted and directed by Icke, designed by Bunny Christie, who created the sensational set for The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, with puppetry by Toby Olié (War Horse). Birmingham Rep, 22 January-5 February, then touring Ian Hislop and Nick Newman’s play about the comedy legend Spike Milligan is set in the 1950s, with Olivier award-winning actor John Dagleish starring as Milligan. Staged to commemorate 20 years since his death, it tells the story of both Milligan and fellow Goons Harry Secombe and Peter Sellers, and how he channeled his dark past to create an entirely new absurdist brand of comedy. Watermill theatre, Newbury, 27 January-5 March After the film success of The Father, Florian Zeller’s new play will focus on the demands – and torments – of family, career and sexual desire in a character’s life. Translated by longtime collaborator Christopher Hampton and directed by Jonathan Kent, the story will no doubt be told in Zeller’s characteristically captivating but unsettling way. Hampstead theatre, London, 5 February-12 March Griff Rhys Jones and Janie Dee star as a couple of retirement-age empty-nesters in this spiky domestic comedy by French writers Gérald Sibleyras and Jean Dell. Their marriage blows up in a conversation that brings emotional outpourings and explosive home truths, all fuelled by plonk. Adapted and directed by Belinda Lang. Theatre Royal Bath, 16-26 February, then touring Exiled from their native country, Belarus Free Theatre, who make underground work in secret locations, will stage this psychological drama set in the near future. Based on a novel by Alhierd Bacharevič (which is banned in Belarus), it revolves around a murder investigation in a dystopian super-state ruled by a secret service. Billed as both an epic fantasy and a political thriller about the dangers of looking away from authoritarianism. Barbican, London, 10-12 March Aaron Sorkin’s Broadway adaptation of Harper Lee’s novel finally arrives in the UK, two years after it was originally scheduled. Directed by Bartlett Sher and starring Rafe Spall as Atticus Finch, the story of racism in 1950s Alabama may resonate all the deeper after the resurgence of Black Lives Matter. Gielgud theatre, London, 10 March-13 August After her acclaimed turn in Hedda Gabler, Ruth Wilson teams up again with the Belgian director Ivo van Hove. This time she will star in Jean Cocteau’s searing monologue, which takes place in a break-up phone conversation between a desperate woman and her lover. Harold Pinter theatre, London, 17 March-9 April Pioneering immersive theatre company Punchdrunk present what is billed as their most ambitious production to date. This show tells the story of the fall of Troy, transposed to a future parallel world. Taking place across three Grade II-listed buildings, it plunges audiences into a dystopian cityscape where they choose to follow characters who emerge from the shadows. One Cartridge Place, London, 22 March-28 August This promises to be a bold and boisterous new musical adapted from Peter Mullan’s cult 1998 film. Powered by the music and lyrics of the Emmy award-winning Scottish indie duo Tommy Reilly and Roddy Hart, it is a darkly comic story of grief, forgiveness and family life. A National Theatre of Scotland production. Beacon Arts Centre, Greenock, Scotland, 1-2 April, then touring Ellen Wilkinson was a firebrand Labour politician who served in Winston Churchill’s cabinet. Caroline Bird’s play suggests she should be better remembered today: a working-class woman who entered parliament, she campaigned for the fight against Franco’s fascists in Spain, spoke up for Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and led 200 workers in the Jarrow Crusade to end unemployment and poverty. Nottingham Playhouse, 13-30 April With a book by the Tony and Olivier award-winning Rick Elice, direction by Arlene Phillips and choreography by Oti Mabuse, this promises to be one of the biggest, loudest and glitziest musicals of the year. Then there is Cher’s life story itself, from her Armenian heritage to her truck-driver father, Sonny Bono and later, the concerts, costumes and pop hits, 35 of which will feature in the show (from Believe to The Shoop Shoop Song). Curve, Leicester, 15-23 April, then touring Jodie Comer will make her West End stage debut in Suzie Miller’s award-winning play about sexual abuse and the legal system. This monologue directed by Justin Martin tells the story of Tessa, a swaggering barrister who finds her position on judicial procedure shifting when she becomes a victim herself. Harold Pinter theatre, London, 15-27 April Brilliant Indian playwright Anupama Chandrasekhar last teamed up with the Kiln’s artistic director, Indhu Rubasingham, on a radically reworked version of Ibsen’s Ghosts which alluded to the Delhi bus gang rape of 2012. They reunite for what sounds like a gripping drama tracing the life of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin, Nathuram Godse, from his beginnings as a devout follower to his radicalisation and their final encounter. Shubham Saraf plays Godse alongside Ayesha Dharker and Peter Singh. National Theatre, London, 12 May-18 June Brad Birch reworks Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People in this story of Mick, an MP whose “think positive” plans and “can-do” spin collide with his sister’s discovery that the town’s water supply is being polluted and he is called upon to act. Directed by Joe Murphy, the story pits the personal against the political, story against reality and emotions against facts. Sherman theatre, Cardiff, 13-28 May Claudia Rankine’s 2019 play tackles white privilege and cultural appropriation. Directed by Natalie Ibu, it tells the story of a wealthy white couple who invite a talented Black artist to dinner, where tension brews high. It poses the question: can society progress when whiteness remains invisible? This is a UK and European premiere and the American writer’s first published play. Home, Manchester, 18-21 May, and various locations Jeremy Herrin revives Tennessee Williams’s semi-autobiographical masterpiece which explores the fragility and fallibility of memory. Amy Adams will make her West End debut in the role of matriarch Amanda Wingfield. In a novel touch, two actors (Paul Hilton and Tom Glynn-Carney) will play Tom, the aspiring poet and narrator. Duke of York’s theatre, London, 23 May-27 August Michael Frayn’s Olivier award-winning comedy, which premiered in 1982, took us behind the scenes of a company of actors to show the unpredictability of life in the theatre. Hailed as a timeless British classic, it will now be revived in a 40th-anniversary production by Elizabeth Newman and Ben Occhipinti. Pitlochry Festival theatre, 27 May-1 October Tamara Rojo creates her first production for English National Ballet, transforming Marius Petipa’s little-performed 1898 ballet into a tale of nurses in the Crimean war, inspired by Florence Nightingale. Rojo has gone back to Petipa’s original choreography, mapping her story on to the master choreographer’s steps, finding a new way to breathe life into the classical repertoire. Set to Glazunov’s original score. London Coliseum, 13-23 January; Mayflower, theatre, Southampton, 30 Nov-3 Dec The main thing you can be sure of is that this show by dance-theatre company Lost Dog will be a long way from Dickens. Choreographer/director Ben Duke’s fanciful imagination has previously turned Paradise Lost into domestic dramedy and Romeo and Juliet into a story of midlife marriage breakdown. Here he focuses on A Tale of Two Cities’ undercooked female character Lucie Manette, redrawing her as a complex 21st-century woman. UK tour opens 8-9 February, Theatre Royal Bury St Edmunds Rather than expecting audiences to come to her, choreographer Jasmin Vardimon is taking dance to the people – in virtual reality form – in a tour of UK shopping centres. It’s a 20-minute experience, based on Alice in Wonderland as filtered through Vardimon’s inventive, highly physical choreography. Sit back, enjoy some 360-degree dance, and buy some cut-price designer togs afterwards. UK tour opens at Ashford Designer Outlet, 8-20 February A new dance festival, featuring major classics of the contemporary canon – Lucinda Childs’ Dance and Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker’s Fase – alongside new works. Lesser known artists on the bill include Katerina Andreou with BSTRD, a duet for dancer and vinyl turntable; and Italian Alessandro Sciarroni, who has revived a Bolognese courtship dance, Polka Chinata, now practised by only five people in the whole of Italy. 9-23 March, various London venues An immersive dance performance by choreographer Ivan Michael Blackstock (who has worked with Beyoncé, no less) confronting themes of mental health, masculinity and the stereotyping of black men. Traplord depicts a young man finding himself on a journey through life, death and rebirth, incorporating spoken word, film, opera, grime and trap music alongside raw and intense dance. 180 The Strand, London, 26 March-16 April The first chance for Scottish audiences to see Kenneth MacMillan’s stormy psychological drama of a ballet, Mayerling, based on the true story of Crown Prince Rudolf, found dead in 1889 beside his teenage mistress Mary Vetsera in a seeming double suicide. Scottish Ballet’s director Christopher Hampson has adapted MacMillan’s 1978 ballet for his company with the blessing of the choreographer’s widow, Deborah MacMillan. Theatre Royal Glasgow, 13-16 April, then touring A new full-length ballet from Christopher Wheeldon, his first for the Royal Ballet since The Winter’s Tale in 2014, reuniting the choreographer with the same creative team: composer Joby Talbot and designer Bob Crowley. Based on Laura Esquivel’s novel, it’s a magical realist story of a Mexican woman’s emotions being transmitted through the food she cooks to the people who eat it. Royal Opera House, London, 2-17 June A familiar face from TV, whose appearances on Taskmaster and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order never fail to raise a smile, Essex man Maddix is no slouch at standup either. He’s giving little away in advance of new touring show King Crud, but if the form book is any guide, expect slacker charm, a radiant sense of fun, and disgruntled social commentary from a working-class, Anglo-Jamaican-Greek perspective. G Live, Guildford, 19 January, then touring If there’s an upside to Nish Kumar quitting The Mash Report, the satirical show he fronted for five years on BBC Two then Dave, it’s that he’s refocusing on live comedy, which he does very well. With Your Power, Your Control, expect more furious, peeved and dismayed jokes about the disintegrating state of the nation – most of which, to be fair, rebound squarely on Kumar himself. Bonus Arena, Hull, 2 February, then touring The UK’s second biggest comedy festival returns, with (fingers crossed) a return to live performance after last year’s digital event. All comic life is here, with stellar acts including Ahir Shah, Maisie Adam, Bilal Zafar, Flo & Joan and fantastic Britain’s Got Talent graduate Nabil Abdulrashid. The fourth ever UK Kids’ Comedy festival runs alongside. Various venues, 2-20 February Her 2019 Edinburgh fringe show The Twist?... She’s Gorgeous was one for the ages, a millennial-meets-maniacal oversharing cabaret, whose acid-bathed songs ranged across sex, self-image and neurosis in the age of Instagram. Now Cohen, a regular at Alan Cumming’s NYC nightspot Club Cumming, brings it back for a one-off gig in March, and musical comedy fans really shouldn’t miss it. Clapham Grand, London, 2 March Nothing she ever does will rival the global impact of Nanette, her 2017 show (and later, Netflix special) about the limits of comedy. Its success has created a buzz around every new show the Tasmanian announces, so Body of Work (“a feelgood live show”, Gadsby calls it, which may touch on her recent marriage) will be one of this spring’s hottest tickets. Manchester Opera House, 6 March, then touring Ubiquitous TV face Joe Lycett secured priceless publicity this month when his 2022 tour posters appeared with fellow comic James Acaster’s face substituted for Lycett’s own. A typical Lycett trick, that – and fans of the Birmingham man’s gadfly behaviour are unlikely to be disappointed by a show that promises, and will certainly deliver, “talking at a room of people in a queer and comedic fashion”. Plymouth Pavilions, 11-12 March, then touring Few comics are as well loved by their peers as US standup Bamford, whose autobiographical Netflix series Lady Dynamite – about mental health, like much of Bamford’s comedy – won her a new legion of fans. And deservedly: nuanced, emotionally exposing and eccentric, she’s unlike anyone else. An occasional visitor to the UK, a short run of dates in 2022 constitutes her first British tour. Liberty Hall theatre, Dublin, 21 April, then touring Inspired perhaps by the success of his new BBC vehicle This Time and podcast From the Oasthouse, Alan Partridge embarks on a rare live tour in 2022. Making his first stage appearance since 2008, Steve Coogan’s deathless alter ego promises a TED talk-style outing, offering “a roadmap to a better tomorrow”… SSE Arena, Belfast, 22 April, then touring The reigning Edinburgh Comedy award champ, and the only one to retain the title three years running (thanks, Covid!), Jordan Brookes now launches a new show, Fix, exploring “how we’ve become so dependent on other people’s opinions of us.” This edgy and unpredictable comic has “always considered my act mainstream”, he says – and with this biggest tour yet, he now seeks to prove it.

12/27/2021,"Seven years ago, in the year before I met the wonderful man I would fall in love with and go on to marry, I had a short but intense relationship with someone I had known as a friend of friends for some time. I’d suddenly and unexpectedly found myself becoming besotted with him after we suddenly and unexpectedly found ourselves sleeping together. JC was very tall, very handsome and very intelligent. Like me, he was recently out of a long-term relationship, and we were both enjoying the sexual freedom that came from not being committed to anyone. I don’t remember exactly how we ended up in bed together the first time, but I do remember liking it very much and rather hoping that it might happen again, which it did – with some regularity.  While he could be very affectionate, he made it clear from the outset that he didn’t consider – or want – us to be anything more than friends with benefits. For much of the time we were carrying on our affair – relationship? Fling? I’m still not sure how to categorise it – I thought I was fine with that. I was certain I didn’t want to be in a committed relationship at that time, with him or anyone else. Yet when we were out together and he went home with somebody else, or when I heard he’d slept with someone after the last time we’d met, I found myself minding more and more, while knowing that I had no right to. It began to make me miserable. Winter came and, along with the cold, something that resembled common sense started to set in. I realised that I was besotted not so much with him, as the idea of him. I was enjoying la douleur exquise of wanting someone so unobtainable., and without even discussing it with him (you can’t really break up with someone you’re not actually going out with), I ended it with JC. Or so I thought. Late one very cold night at a notoriously debauched supper club, I was just getting stuck into my starter when I began receiving text messages from JC that seemed to speak directly to the feelings I’d been experiencing but had not expressed. “You know what you mean to me,” he said. Did I? I wasn’t sure. “You know I want what you want” – well, this was news to me. But my heart raced and my pulse quickened and, rather than sit at the table texting, I went outside and gave him a call. I was bitterly cold outside in just a T-shirt, and then it began to snow. Then JC told me, unprompted and as if reading my mind, that he loved me and didn’t want to be without me, but nor did he want to be in a relationship with me. The snow grew heavier and the wind blew it around in dramatic whorls, but I couldn’t bear to interrupt the moment to go back inside. I needed to hear what was being said, and a blizzard wasn’t going to prevent that. Half an hour later, my very drunk dinner companions having barely registered my absence, I returned to the table red-nosed and blue-faced. My skin was simultaneously freezing and burning, and I’d lost all feeling in my extremities. But I had heard things I’d needed to hear, which made it all worthwhile. I had known love in a cold climate. Shortly afterwards, by mutual agreement this time, JC and I did end things, acknowledging that there was nowhere for us, as a “we”, to go. We remain close friends to this day; although we have both gone on to long-term, more fulfilling relationships, I think he would agree that we had something special, whatever it was. On reflection, I’m not sure it was worth nearly contracting frostbite for.

12/27/2021,"There was always one thing I was sure of – I’d not let Mum go into a care home or be looked after by a stranger. Marje has always been a brilliant mother, forever loyal when others wrote me off. So come the day when she tired of living by herself in Salford, or couldn’t cope, I’d be there for her. I assumed she would come to live with me – or my sister Sharon – in London. She could stay in our house, or we could build her a granny flat. We’d even allow her to live in a flat nearby so long as we could pop in every day and take care of her.  There was only one problem with my plan – I hadn’t thought about what she wanted. Just tiny things, like her house, her friends, her independence. Marje is 93 now. Until last year she was in great nick. Although she was a shrunken version of her younger self, she was still warm, kind, curious, laugh-out-loud funny and fiercely independent. But earlier this year, she slipped on her bathroom floor and broke her femur. Somehow, she crawled back to her bedroom to call us. The ambulance came, she was operated on and there followed a lengthy stay in hospital. Suddenly, she seemed much older – almost her real age. She couldn’t move, she lost weight, she got infections that sent her potty. Her short-term memory was shot and she couldn’t focus. She was unhappy and in pain. After a few weeks in hospital, Marje was transferred to a rehab home. She lay in bed or sat in a chair and deteriorated even more. Still, she insisted she didn’t want to come stay with us in London afterwards. She wanted to return to her own home and get on with life. She was terrified of being a burden; of being unwanted. But there was more to it than that. Marje loved her mews house in the close that reminds me of a mini-Brookside. It was perfect for her – tiny, quiet, self-contained. She was part of the community she’d spent her entire life in (a five-minute walk from where she grew up and where she spent her married life). And her few remaining friends (invariably younger than her) meant a lot to her. London isn’t her city, and never could be. It’s where she used to come to visit family and have a break. Eventually, I accepted she wanted to stay put. So, with a degree of horror, I started talking to my sister about a full-time carer for Marje. What kind of children farm out their mother to a carer? Was this how I returned the love she had shown me? Why spend all her money on the care we should provide? What if she and the carer didn’t get on? What if the carer abused her? Sharon assured me the woman she had in mind came recommended. I trusted her and we all took the plunge. Enter Josie – small, smart, smiley, funny, kind. In other words, she’s very much like Marje. Josie has now been with her for three months, and Marje is totally transformed. She is learning to walk again, her short-term memory has improved, she has put on weight because Josie’s food is so delicious. And, for the first time, Marje has accepted that she can’t do everything for herself; that she’s reached an age where she’s earned the privilege of relaxing – watching TV, reading, listening to music, going for wheelchair walks when she’s got the strength. Josie cooks for her, helps her shower, sorts out her pills, deals with the nitty-gritty of running the house. But the most astonishing and beautiful thing is the relationship she and Josie have developed. They sit on the sofa together, chat and giggle. Josie tells Marje about her childhood in the Philippines, her children and grandchildren, the 21 years she spent in Madrid working for a famous singer and the time she cooked for Plácido Domingo. Marje talks to Josie about her children and grandchildren, and the years she spent teaching children with special needs. Josie tries to teach her a bit of Spanish. Marje tries to improve her tenses in English. Josie takes pictures of her, and sends us nice or funny ones. In one, she is wearing a fake fur coat, shades and is scowling – she looks like the angriest billionaire in Salford. (She isn’t angry or a billionaire.) Already, they are like mother and daughter, or sisters. Visitors occasionally pop in. Marje is glad of the visit, but she’s often relieved when they leave and it’s just her and Josie again. Josie feels as much family as Sharon and I do. Sometimes more. Josie is a full-time, live-in carer, five days a week. (On the other two days Josie’s daughter-in-law Marlene, who is also becoming like family, looks after Marje.) Often, Josie doesn’t bother going home on her days off; she simply does more of her own thing. Just a few weeks ago, Mum was frazzled. Now she is calm, secure and on the whole content. It was stupid of me to think I could ever look after Marje like Josie and Marlene do. I don’t have their patience or skill set. In a way, it was selfish – more about a misplaced sense of duty than what was best for her – and could have ended up imprisoning Mum. Instead, thanks to Josie and Marlene, Sharon and I have peace of mind, and Marje has been given a new life.

12/27/2021,"What does Mark Zuckerberg care about? The 37-year-old tech executive has a wife, two kids, $110bn , and near absolute control over a group of companies – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp – that shape the information, entertainment, and communication of 3 billion people.  But in a year that kicked off with those companies playing a major role in fueling a violent and conspiracy-addled riot at the US Capitol on 6 January, and closed with a whistleblower revealing just how much Facebook knew – and concealed from the public – about the damage it was doing to individuals and societies, Zuckerberg has himself seemed remarkably unbothered. Gone is the Zuckerberg who repeated apologies and pledges to take a broader view of Facebook’s responsibility ad nauseum. New Zuck (dare we call him “metaZuck”?) appears to be primarily focused on his super relatable hobbies (electric surfing, fencing, hydrofoiling, boar hunting) and building a fantasy world that he hasn’t managed to mess up – yet. “I just decided to focus more on some of the awesome things we’re building, and doing more fun things with my family and friends,” Zuckerberg said to a fan who asked about the secret to his being “super laid-back and funny these last few months”. The Guardian would have loved to ask Zuckerberg some follow-up questions about that, but since metaZuck isn’t doing much in the way of sitting for interviews with critical journalists these days, we fell back upon a last resort: we built another Zuckerbot and interviewed it instead. To do this, we worked with Botnik Studios to create a predictive keyboard trained on the past two years of Zuckerberg’s public statements (archived by Marquette University’s Zuckerberg Files). Our previous interview with the Zuckerbot, conducted in 2019 and based on Zuck’s statements from 2016 to 2019, can be found here. Guardian journalists provided the questions; Botnik used the predictive keyboard to generate the answers. Hi Mark, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to the Guardian. It’s been a busy two years since we spoke, and your company has now been implicated in even more violence and unrest around the world. Congratulations! Thank you for welcoming me here today with your own self. Being present with you in person is going to be a killer part of history. To start, you recently changed Facebook’s name to Meta. Why? Imagine a multiplayer game where you pay off a bunch of publications who are physically afraid of content. This is the basic idea behind the internet. Now look up at the sun, close your eyes, feel completely wrapped in virtual goods and commerce. That is the ultimate expression of social networks. That is the metaverse. Can you share any details about what kinds of new experiences will be possible in the metaverse? We tested a model where a big Priscilla avatar fried people using an energy field if they said false things about my friends, and I think it’s going to unlock a lot of new community policies. The metaverse is really just about playing video games, right? The metaverse is a big, valuable baked dumpling full of content without nudity. How long do you think it will take for Meta to be implicated in a campaign of genocide or ethnic violence? The hardest technology to deliver is peace. We built tools that businesses can go, “OK, look at this inflection point. Now we’re entering into the metaverse. Blood conflict is just spam. Thank you, but I never want extreme stuff.” This vision is a reality if you peer through a custom headset. Do you have another name lined up for the rebrand after that? We have some fun brands around at this company for the last year of the metaverse. I really love “Click and Forget”, and then there is “Civilization Meats”, and we took a very different direction with “Earth Problem From Facebook”. We have a lot of these, so we think we’ll be awesome for a few years. Facebook has shown itself to be utterly incapable of policing its platform in this universe. What makes you think things will be better in the metaverse? Think about the metaverse as a symptom of our existence and you will actually feel completely hot for businesses. I believe that we’re building a type of modern relationship where people are spending time grilling with their sentient loans. Recently, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen left the company with a trove of documents that were shared with major news outlets. What is your response to her release of research showing that Facebook knew its products were harming society, and frequently failed to act? I think that people like that are big challenges that we’re dealing with all the time. We built a robot to go back to the beginning of Facebook and deleted all the data, so that’s going to be pretty cool in the past. The documents reveal that Facebook spends about 90% of its resources fighting misinformation on the United States, and 10% on the rest of the world, while about 10% of Facebook’s users are in the United States, and 90% are in the rest of the world. How do you justify that? In the world, we can do nothing to help. In America, we have to deal with senators and Elected Joe, so we build systems that stop terrorists from hacking your news. In VR, you can teleport to the news publishers’ newsroom and ask them if the information is real (they are going to misuse this, but it’s going to be really exciting to see). You appear to have spent a lot of time in recent years focused on your hobbies: hydrofoiling, e-surfing, VR fencing, boar hunting, and destroying democracy. What’s your secret to maintaining a good work-life balance? I am reminded of my favorite multiplayer experience: values. These are really important for relationships and I think generally they are the future of communication. So much fun for me to sit down with some pretty fundamental values and interests like Peloton bike and augmented traffic and just think about all kinds of topics. Instagram has stolen stories from Snapchat, Reels from Tiktok and IGTV from YouTube. What future plans do you have for further IP theft? We all want to take advantage of creators like that, but there’s a different way – yeah, I mean, basically just going in their data to help me to a compelling version of the issues, then also log in to the same tools that they were trying to work on and, um, we will actually be able to have their content remotely deleted. The metaverse is going to support that. Will you let your own children use Instagram, given your own company’s research into how harmful it can be to children’s mental health? Teenagers have a lot of ways to express their views on the internet and now they have one more; they can monetize their families with our “family permanence experience”. You were raised Jewish and have said religion is very important to you. How do you think God will judge you? I believe deeply in a wireless experience you have in the Next Time. You get a mentor and you see a cool effect, and then you go to juvenile detention center in the metaverse. It has a massive amount of problematic goods and it has solar-powered privacy controls that you can break by talking. And it has a major part with a judgment room, right in the top. In this room we are always faced by ourselves. This is inspiring for a second, but it starts to be clear that you are very afraid. That’s gonna be a big part of the challenge in the world to come. You control a 55% voting stake in your company. What safeguards exist to check your power? I need to ask permission from a big personal influence – my parents. They don’t expect that their friends will like the new things I’ve done. Hopefully, later on helping me will become their lives but for now we’re gonna roll with social media for all kinds of ages. Let’s play a game. What are two truths and one lie about yourself? One: I have no company. Two: I have no tolerance for the town square. Three: I do surfing and I am grateful for the world of water. Do you still think Facebook is making the world a better place? The world is going to end, and if we don’t make money from that, then we should just sit down in the water and make Reels right into the last couple of days.",News/Technology,‘I do surfing’: an AI-generated Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook’s bad year,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/27/mark-zuckerberg-ai-robot-metaverse-facebook
12/27/2021,"A funeral for Covid victims, MumbaiDivyakant Solanki/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock  23 April I was staying on the outskirts of Mumbai when news broke that there was a fire in one of the hospitals dealing with Covid patients. I rushed over to find them shifting patients to other hospitals; they said more than 10 people had died already as a result. The funeral was devastating. There were 10 to 12 Covid victims laid out on the funeral pyre with their relatives gathered around, many of them in tears. Dealing with the emotions of relatives and loved ones is the most difficult part of covering events as a photojournalist. Civic workers, such as the man in this photo, had a very important role in funerals during Covid – they were the only people allowed to issue last rites. Sadly, there wasn’t nearly enough PPE for relatives to be able to enter the funeral ground or touch the bodies of their dead family members. This photo is very close to my heart; I have seen so many dead bodies over the past year, but it is difficult to capture the impact that has had on me, let alone the people who have lost relatives. I think seeing a man in PPE, sombrely walking between funeral pyres, shows the human toll of the pandemic. As told to Alex Mistlin Tunisian people wait for help on a wooden boat, Lampedusa, ItalySanti Palacios/AP 25 July We were sailing in international waters just south of the island of Lampedusa when we heard fishers calling through the radio, saying there was this small boat with 17 people in it that was taking on water and desperate for help. The most difficult thing about working at sea is having to work around the rescue operation. The sea route connecting Libya to Italy is one of the deadliest migrant routes in the world. You are in the middle of nowhere, which can be very challenging, especially at night. But when you are lucky and have enough light, or a full moon, you really get the chance to show how lonely the crossings are. I worry that it is not always apparent how extreme these situations are. People have already seen pictures of refugees drowning in the Mediterranean; everyone knows that it is going on. So, the goal is to take pictures that better convey the intensity of their experiences. AM Kim Kardashian at the Met Gala, New YorkJustin Lane/EPA 13 September I have been covering the Met Gala for a number of years. It is always a bizarre scene. Any red carpet is exciting, but it is such a weird mix of people: businesspeople, music stars, movie stars. There is a frenetic quality to the whole thing that means you can get two completely random celebrities standing next to each other. This is a funny picture, in some ways. To have somebody show up in this outfit, totally covered in black – it shows how celebrity is at a weird juncture. Of course, there are plenty of bizarre outfits at the Met Gala – there is a long procession of crazy outfits and celebrities trying to one-up one another – but being covered in black was so different that it caught my attention. Something really wacky, or really sexy, is almost more mundane. Kim Kardashian is always of great interest to people. It is so much about what she has decided to do in that moment. AM A house covered by ash on La Palma in the Canary Islands, SpainEmilio Morenatti/AP 30 October The first time I went to La Palma to cover the eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano, the exclusion zone was protected by police, which meant I wasn’t able to get close enough. This was taken on my second trip. I spotted a house on the horizon that was completely covered in ash. My first aim was just to go there on foot, but it wasn’t possible, because of the hot rocks and stones rolling down from the volcano. It can be really impersonal using a drone, but sometimes it is the only option – the only way of capturing the magnitude of the tragedy. The volcano continued to emit vast amounts of magma and ash for more than a month after the eruption. I saw a lot of houses covered completely, but this one was the most visually affecting, because the house is so isolated. It is such a clean snapshot of the devastation the volcano caused. The house is still standing, though. AM A nun pleads with the police in Myitkyina, MyanmarMyitkyina News Journal/AFP/Getty Images 8 March Having been the de facto leader of Myanmar since winning a landslide election in November 2015 and assuming the role of state counsellor in April 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi was deposed in a military coup on 1 February. In the resulting protests, hundreds of people – including dozens of children – were killed by the security forces. This shot, by an unattributed photographer, shows a nun in the northern city of Myitkyina remonstrating with police officers amid the crackdown. An Indonesian burial team in Yogyakarta, JavaUlet Ifansasti/Getty Images 12 August In July and August, Indonesia was really struggling to contain its Covid outbreak. I had the idea of photographing a burial team to show how Covid protocols were affecting every aspect of life in Indonesia. Yogyakarta was particularly badly hit by the Delta variant; you would hear ambulance sirens everywhere you went and the burial teams were at the frontline. It is them who have to deal with the situation when people go into hospital and don’t come out alive. I was at a hospital when, at about 11pm, I got the call to put on my hazmat suit and head to the cemetery. Covid protocols meant that people had to be distant from their family in their final moments. It was so sad seeing the families praying outside the cemeteries, knowing that their loved one’s burial was being left to a team of strangers in hazmat suits. AM Tom Daley knits before the men’s 10m platform final at the Olympics, TokyoClive Rose/Getty Images 7 August I have been photographing Tom since Beijing 2008. He is a joy to photograph. This was just before his 10m Olympic final. With the Covid protocols, there wasn’t enough time to go back and chill in the Olympic village, so he just found a quiet corner of the swimming pool, practically under the diving board, and got his knitting kit out. Him not having his shirt on adds a nice touch, because of the contrast between his masculinity – his washboard abs and athlete’s physique – and how relaxed he looks, knitting away. I just thought it was a nice moment, not necessarily for now, but to look back on in 20 or 30 years’ time. It was quite a strange Olympics, because of Covid, but for an athlete to start knitting in the middle of an Olympic competition was truly unique. It is very much in keeping with who he is, which is cool. Looking back, people probably remember the whole knitting thing better than him winning his medals. AM A mob attempts to breach the US Capitol, Washington DCVictor J Blue/Bloomberg 6 January I had covered a series of large rallies in DC around Trump’s Stop the Steal campaign. By 6 January, we were all prepared for violence around the city, mainly from far right or fascist groups, but anyone who says they knew what was going to happen is a liar. Trump came on stage to the adulation of the crowd, but after 10 or 15 minutes people began peeling away and marching up Pennsylvania Avenue. Maybe they had just heard it all before, but I felt pretty strongly that I needed to be at the front of that group. This picture was taken towards the end of the riot, just after they had breached Congress. I had already been inside with the rioters and was very close to the killing of Ashli Babbitt by a Capitol police officer. The US Congress is a huge building and there were maybe 2,000 protesters trying to breach a set of wooden doors and re-enter the building. Police units inside the building had run out of the chemical irritant they use for crowd control and had resorted to spraying fire extinguishers out the doors. That was when one protester stood at the entrance, spreading his arms in triumph, almost as if to celebrate Trump’s victory in that moment. AM Police detain a woman as people gather after the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard, Clapham Common, LondonHannah McKay/Reuters 13 March Sometimes London can lack a community feel – you don’t know your neighbours – so seeing so many people, particularly young women, come out for this woman whom none of them knew really added to the sense of emotion on the day. There was a lot of crying. There was a small group of protesters addressing hundreds of people from the bandstand. As it was still during Covid restrictions, the police eventually arrived to end the gathering, but many were determined to continue paying their respects. It went from a reflective, emotional scene to an angry one. That was when the police and protesters clashed. I was in the centre of the bandstand when the police began arresting protesters. There was a commotion and I have no idea how Patsy Stevenson came to be forced to the ground, but I have pictures of her on the floor, face down with her hands behind her back. People have said it looks like a painting – she looks so striking with her pale skin and red hair – but it was pitch black and I couldn’t use flash because of the police hi-vis jackets. There is all sorts of luck involved in the elements coming together in this image. I think the picture of a lone female protester being restrained by faceless male police officers helped to propel the story into a talking point; it became a symbol of anger. AM A fisher feeds whale sharks in Tan-Awan, the PhilippinesHannah Reyes Morales/The New York Times/Eyevine 30 September I thought it was really interesting to explore how lockdown measures were affecting the relationship between Tan-Awan, a town in the Philippines, and a species in decline. Living in the Philippines, you often witness the tension between wildlife conservation and local communities. Feeding the whale sharks has an impact on their nutrition and migration patterns, while the sharks have abrasions from swimming too close to the boats. But the chance to swim with the world’s biggest fish draws tourists to the town. These fishers wouldn’t be doing this if they had more promising economic opportunities, so I don’t believe in making villains of the community for this practice. I was swimming with the camera, positioning it above and below the water and photographing as widely as I could. To get the entire shark, you have to be quite far away, but not so far that you sacrifice visibility. I find underwater photography challenging – the world is so different beneath the surface. It was important to me to have the shark and the sea warden in the same frame, as this photo is really about a complex interdependence. AM Tourists watch a volcano erupt, IcelandArnar Kristjansson 9 April This was taken just as the second crater started to form. Earlier in the day, I was caught in a massive snowstorm and I was worried there would be no way to capture it on film. But I decided to wait around just in case the snow cleared; you can never trust the forecast in Iceland. It was weird seeing people standing so close. It can be very dangerous, mainly because of the gas, rather than the lava – if the wind changes direction, then people can get violently ill. There was a teenager taking TikTok videos of himself jumping fewer than five metres away. It was one of those pinch-yourself moments where you capture something truly surreal. The crater you can see in this photo died within a few days, but some of the others formed from this eruption lasted for months. The one here is the most photogenic, however. I think it is really quite beautiful. AM The last moments of an orphaned mountain gorilla, Virunga national park, Democratic Republic of the CongoBrent Stirton/Getty Images 21 September I have worked with those gorillas for quite a long time. I was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2007, doing a story on how a group of rangers had gone to South Africa for paramilitary training, to combat the various militia groups that were operating in that park. Three days into that assignment, we heard that a group of severely endangered mountain gorillas had been killed. Since then, I have been returning to the park on a regular basis. In September, I was focused on documenting an operation to clear a group of militias out of the park. While I was there, Ndakasi wasn’t doing well. I went to cover a medical procedure they were doing with her. When she came out of anaesthesia, her caregiver, Andre Bauma, and two vets worked to resuscitate her. After that, she was very weak and crawled on top of Andre. Every part of her was on top of him, the same way a baby would. It was very childlike. The park knew she was very sick, but was hoping she would recover. Then things took a turn. It was very sombre. Once it was clear what was happening, I shot these frames and left, because it became a very personal moment between her and Andre. She was the only gorilla to survive that massacre in 2007. She was a baby and was found suckling her dead mother. It was very cold and babies can die of exposure very quickly. On that day, Andre became her caregiver. The story is he put her inside his shirt for warmth and walked about four miles through a dangerous area. There is a certain cycle to how she died, being close to him, being held by him again. As told to Emine Saner A girl in her destroyed home, GazaFatima Shbair/Getty Images 24 May I was on assignment for Getty Images that day to cover Gaza after the [Gaza-Israel] ceasefire agreement. I headed straight to Beit Hanoun – the neighbourhood had been hit while families were in their homes. I visited all the families there, heard their stories and went inside the destroyed houses, including the home of Raghad Naseer. Raghad accompanied me from one room to another, carrying her teddy bear. I asked Raghad about her room and she took me to it. She was quiet the whole time, with signs of shock and sadness on her face. She stood in her room in complete silence, contemplating what had happened to the neighbourhood through the destroyed wall, as if she could not comprehend it. Seeing Raghad in this state was very painful. In this picture, she was expressing the feelings of all the residents of the neighbourhood. It sums up everything that happened. I visited Raghad again this month. She and her family had to leave the neighbourhood and rent a small house far away. Raghad and her siblings suffer psychologically from what happened; they feel very upset at losing their home and being separated from their neighbours. Taking this picture made me think: my home could have been like this at any moment and I would have lived with the same feeling. I look at the people in Beit Hanoun and think how strong they are. ES Taliban fighters at Hamid Karzai International airport recite evening prayers, KabulJim Huylebroek/The New York Times/Eyevine 28 August This was taken a couple of weeks after the fall of Kabul. Outside the airport, it was complete chaos; it felt like everyone in the country was trying to get in. Just a couple of days prior, the [Islamic State offshoot] ISKP attack had killed hundreds. These men are special forces who have been deployed to secure the airport. It was very difficult getting access and, on my previous attempts, I had either been turned away or beaten. That day, I was determined to get in. When night fell, I made my way inside, before explaining to a group of Taliban fighters that I just needed a few photos of them inside the gate. One guy, the man you can see leading the prayers, started speaking English; he said I might be able to take some after prayers. I asked if I could take them during. Seeing the fighters praying with their modern military equipment, uniforms and helmets seemed like a good encapsulation of how the Taliban had transitioned from a guerrilla force to a modern military operation. This image is important to me personally, because it vindicated my decision to stay through August. It was a gamble, because we knew things would be uncertain once the Taliban took over, but I felt I had to be there to document the end of the global war on terror as we know it. AM Revellers at Bushwig, a drag extravaganza, New YorkStephanie Keith/Reuters 12 September I attended the first Bushwig 10 years ago and was taken aback; it was freer, more avant garde, than anything I had seen previously. Since then, it has become probably the biggest drag festival in the world, with hundreds of performers over two days. It is a must-do event in New York City queer nightlife. That is Amanda Lepore. She is quite the character, more icon than woman at this point. When she steps on the stage, everyone just flips out – girls, boys, straight, gay. She stands for everything that is important about drag: embracing yourself and having the ability to be whoever you want to be. AM A refugee is comforted by a member of the Spanish Red Cross, Ceuta, SpainBernat Armangue/AP 18 May This was taken in Ceuta, one of two Spanish exclaves bordering Morocco on Africa’s Mediterranean coast. Given that politically it is in Europe, it is a long-established route into the continent. On 17 and 18 May, more than 8,000 people crossed over. This man arrived with his brother, who fell unconscious. He started freaking out, scared that his companion was dying. A member of the Red Cross consoled him, saying everything was going to be OK. It was just one of those moments; he had no choice but to collapse, not only because of the traumatic situation, but also, I imagine, because of the weight of everything they had been through in the previous few weeks. A lot of the time, arriving migrants do not receive the help or attention they need – it was so great to capture a moment of genuine connection between two human beings, independent of their backgrounds or religions. AM A horse being airlifted by the Swiss military, SaignelégierFabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images 9 April I was told the Swiss army veterinary service were carrying out tests and there were rumours that this would feature horses being airlifted by helicopter. I had no idea how that was going to work, but I suspected it might make for a nice picture. The horses are tranquillised and have their face covered before being attached to the helicopter. Their bodies are wrapped, too, as it gets quite cold up there. I couldn’t include the helicopter in the shot, as the cable was too long – almost 30 metres – but I think it gives the photograph a surreal air, just seeing a horse suspended like that. It is a very strange image. I think it is improved by not having the context of the helicopter. The horses are carried over quite long distances, often for more than half an hour. What I really like about this picture is that you can see the movement of the horse – you can almost feel it swinging in the wind. AM Residents evacuate an island hit by wildfires, Evia, GreeceKonstantinos Tsakalidis/Bloomberg via Getty Images 8 August As soon as I reached the island of Evia, I could see the fires raging in the distance, rising above the sky and burning with this awe-inspiring intensity. You could hear this terrifying crackling sound across the island; it was unlike anything I had ever experienced. I saw Panayiota Noumidi, 81, moving awkwardly outside the house you can see here. She was clearly distressed, so I approached her. She said she couldn’t find her husband (they were later reunited) and that she was fearful for her home – they had built it slowly over 20 years and it looked like the flames were heading straight towards it (it was not damaged). It was a chaotic day, but I tried my best to capture the intensity of the fire, the desperation of people in Evia and the lack of government help for those in distress. I knew straight away the picture was an important reflection of the situation facing Greek people. But I couldn’t imagine it would go viral around the world. It has come to symbolise the climate crisis, with the catastrophic damage caused by the fires representing the damage that human activity is doing to the planet. For me, it is very special to take a photo that affects so many people around the world. AM Denmark footballers form a human shield around their teammate Christian Eriksen at Euro 2020, CopenhagenFriedemann Vogel/EPA 12 June This was taken roughly four or five minutes after Eriksen collapsed. At the moment I took this, no one knew if he was even alive. I tried to maintain distance throughout. Uefa’s Covid rules prevented me from going on to the pitch, but, regardless, I felt it was important not to do anything that might interfere with the medical team’s work. I got a lot of criticism for this picture, for trying to get a shot of someone who was potentially dead, but it is my job. It is really important to show the reality of the situation. Seeing the fans hoping and praying was so powerful. Regardless of nationality or support, everyone just wanted Eriksen to be OK. The faces of the players around Eriksen are unbelievable. They can clearly see how serious the situation is and they are extremely distressed. Restarting someone’s heart is incredibly difficult; when you see it up close, as I could, you realise how much every moment matters. AM People feed seagulls in the smog, DelhiNavesh Chitrakar/Reuters 18 November From the moment I arrived in Delhi, my eyes burned from the thick smog. I wasn’t there for work; it was more of a holiday, with my wife, so I took the opportunity to spend a few days waking up early and getting out to take pictures. After I came back from the shoot, I went through all the pictures and almost didn’t bother to file this one. But I asked my wife: “Which picture should I go with?” and this one was her selection. The initial story was about the pollution, but for me this picture is all about the birds; they look so dramatic against the smog-filled backdrop. AM",Arts/Art and design,The best photographs of 2021 – and the stories behind them,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/27/the-best-photographs-of-2021-and-the-stories-behind-them
12/27/2021,"NHS staff treating Covid patients should be given much more protective facewear than thin surgical masks to help them avoid getting infected during the Omicron rise, doctors say. The British Medical Association (BMA), Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) and Doctors’ Association UK are calling for frontline personnel to be given FFP3 masks.  Making the much higher-quality face masks standard issue would save the lives of health workers who fall ill as a result of treating Covid patients, the BMA said. “At this critical point in the pandemic this is extremely urgent – a matter of life and death,” said Prof Raymond Agius, the acting chair of the doctors’ union’s occupational health committee. FFP3 masks, also known as filtering facepiece respirators, have been shown in a trial in Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge to reduce the number of healthcare staff who become infected. However, the Department of Health and Social Care’s (DHSC) guidance on personal protective equipment, updated last week, only recommends their use in limited circumstances. “With a high transmissible new strain now circulating, and clear evidence that Covid-19 spreads in small airborne particles, healthcare workers must be given the best possible protection against the virus. Surgical masks don’t give the necessary protection against airborne transmission of Covid,” Agius said. The BMA has written to every hospital trust in England demanding that any health professional treating patients who are or may be Covid-positive should be routinely issued with FFP3s, which are much more expensive than the surgical masks usually provided. Surgical masks are “unsuitable” given the threat Covid poses, the BMA believes. In its letter it has reminded hospital chief executives of their legal responsibilities as employers to keep their staff safe from harm, including by providing FFP3s. A handful of hospitals are understood to already issued FFP3 respirators as standard, but most do not. Dr Claudia Paoloni, the president of the HCSA, said that giving staff proper PPE would help reduce the fast-growing tide of sickness absence among frontline workers who are getting Covid. “If we don’t get PPE right we risk contributing to a further wave of sickness absences when hospitals and patients can least afford it. “The current reliance on inadequate fluid-resistant surgical masks is likely to leave staff vulnerable in enclosed hospital settings,” Paoloni said. “The fear, as in 2020, is that we are seeing a cavalier approach to safety where infection control guidelines are once again being driven by supply issues and cost. “We need hospitals to see sense and take a precautionary approach,” by making FFP3s available to anyone who wants to use one instead of a surgical mask, Paoloni added. The BMA has also written to NHS England asking it to ensure all GP practices are also issued with FFP3s instead of surgical masks, particularly because family doctors often work in small, cramped surgeries. “Healthcare workers in hospitals and GP surgeries are putting themselves and potentially their own families at risk, particularly with this new, highly transmissible Omicron variant,” said Dr Vishal Sharma, the chair of the BMA’s pensions committee. The DHSC’s updated guidance, published last Tuesday, says “staff should assess any likely blood and body fluid exposure risk and ensure PPE is worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task being undertaken”. However, it only advises frontline staff to use an FFP3 if they are undertaking an aerosol-generating procedure, such as intubating a patient who is going on to a mechanical ventilator, and not with Covid patients generally. A DHSC spokesperson confirmed that it does not plan to recommend routine use of FFP3 masks. “The safety of the NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to deliver PPE to protect those on the frontline. “Guidance on the appropriate levels and standards of PPE is written by clinical experts. Updated infection prevention control guidance was published this month to reflect the latest scientific understanding on how to prevent transmission of Covid-19. “Emerging evidence and data are continually monitored and reviewed and guidance will be amended accordingly if appropriate.”",News/World news,"Give FFP3 masks to NHS staff during Omicron, doctors say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/give-ffp3-masks-to-nhs-staff-omicron-doctors-say
12/27/2021,"A New York man charged with assaulting a police officer during the deadly Capitol riot has asked a judge for permission to use dating websites while confined at his parents’ house.  Thomas Sibick, of Buffalo, was part of a pro-Trump mob the then president urged to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden. Five people died around events at the Capitol on 6 January, including a police officer and a rioter shot by law enforcement. Lawmakers hid or were hustled to safety as some rioters sought figures including Vice-President Mike Pence to capture or possibly kill. Sibick, 36, awaits trial. He is alleged to have taken part in an “ongoing violent assault” of the former Washington police officer Michael Fanone, “ripping off [his] radio – his lifeline for help – and his badge”. Fanone was seriously injured and has become a leading voice seeking accountability for the rioters and those who urged them on, giving emotional testimony to the House select committee investigating the attack. He announced last week that he had resigned as a police officer, to join CNN. Earlier this year, Sibick sought to escape the company of other Capitol rioters in a Washington jail, even volunteering for solitary confinement. In October, Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered Sibick to enter home confinement under supervision of his parents. He is not allowed to attend political rallies, use social media or watch talk shows on cable news. “There will only be one chance,” Judge Jackson said then. “If you violate my conditions, it will indicate my trust was misplaced.” Nonetheless, in a Christmas Day filing first reported by Business Insider, Sibick sought permission to use social media to look for a job and to “interact with members of the opposite gender for the purpose of establishing a friendship”. His attorney, Stephen Brennwald, wrote: “He is not seeking to use any social media application for any prohibited purpose, such as for political engagement, news reading, or any other activity that would violate not only the letter, but the spirit, of his release conditions. “Mr Sibick realises that if he were to meet someone on a social media site, he would be unable to leave his home for the purpose of going to dinner or to participate in other events. He does, however, feel the need to establish some sort of connection with someone (if possible, in light of his situation).” Sibick has said he now views the Capitol attack as “without question unconscionable”, a “disgrace to our nation” and “a scar Trump is ultimately responsible for”. But he is among more than 700 people charged. Earlier this month, a man who attacked officers with a fire extinguisher was sentenced to more than five years in prison, the longest sentence yet handed down. Robert Palmer, 54 and from Florida, told a judge he now recognised that Trump and others stoked the riot by “spitting out the false narrative about a stolen election and how it was ‘our duty’ to stand up to tyranny”. “Little did I realise that they were the tyrannical ones desperate to hold on to power at any cost,” Palmer said, “even by creating the chaos they knew would happen with such rhetoric”. Trump was impeached for a second time, for inciting an insurrection. Ten House Republicans and seven senators turned against him but he was still acquitted. Members of the House 6 January committee have indicated that they could recommend Trump be criminally charged.",News/US news,Capitol rioter in Michael Fanone assault asks judge to let him use dating websites,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/27/capitol-rioter-thomas-sibick-assault-michael-fanone
12/27/2021,"Television is going through a golden age but viewers are so spoilt for choice there is a danger people miss the good stuff, the actor Jamie Dornan has said. Dornan is about to be seen on film in Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast and on television in BBC One’s six-part thriller The Tourist.  In an interview with the Radio Times, he said it was a golden age of television, but that came with danger. “We are so spoilt for choice,” he said. “And you’ve also got that ability now where if you’re not enjoying it, you move on to the next thing. Which I think is a bit dangerous. “You know, it’s sad. How many times do we watch stuff and say: ‘I wasn’t sure – it took me three episodes to get into it.’ But it’s still hard to get stuff made. If you’ve got to the stage of getting it made, chances are there’s something good in there, and you’ve just got to give it a chance.” Dornan was a hugely successful model before turning to acting with a smouldering appearance in Sofia Coppola’s 2006 film Marie Antoinette, which led to a piece in the New York Times headlined “The Golden Torso”. His breakthrough came as the sexy serial killer in the BBC drama series The Fall, starring alongside Gillian Anderson. He gained further stardom, as well as much derision, for his portrayal of Christian Grey in the film adaptation of the sadomasochistic romp Fifty Shades of Grey. That was followed by the critically panned Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described Dornan’s performances in Fifty Shades of Grey as “strictly daytime soap”. His performance in Belfast, on the other hand, has been widely praised, with speculation that he may make it on to the best supporting actor Oscar shortlist. The film goes on general release next month but has already picked up five-star reviews from festival screenings. In The Tourist, Dornan plays a nameless British man who wakes up in the Australian outback with amnesia and who is being pursued by dangerous, shady figures from his past. At the start of the year, while he was quarantining in an Australian hotel before the shoot, Dornan’s father, Prof Jim Dornan, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, died from Covid. “We’ve all had some sort of testing experience, albeit some more than others,” Dornan said. “As bad as the personal impact on me has been, I’m hoping that something positive comes out of Covid in that this will, in our lifetime, probably be the one thing that worldwide we’ve all experienced together. It’s impacted us all in different ways, of course, but hopefully will have a unifying quality.”",Arts/Culture,Jamie Dornan: ‘spoilt-for-choice’ TV viewers risk discarding shows too soon,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/27/jamie-dornan-spoilt-for-choice-tv-viewers-risk-discarding-shows-too-soon
12/27/2021,"It was a year of fire and storms, of crumbling cliffs and falling trees, all of which put a huge strain on flora and fauna, according to an annual audit of the impact of the weather on nature in the UK. There were many losers, including rare birds and mammals displaced by blazes on uplands in the north of England and Northern Ireland, but also winners, from crickets heard singing for the first time in newly colonised places to the grey seals that enjoyed a good breeding season despite the turmoil.  The National Trust said this helter-skelter picture was the new normal because of the climate emergency, and age-old patterns of nature and the very shape of the UK were undergoing quick – and permanent – change. “Climate change is making some forms of extreme weather events the new normal,” said Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation and restoration ecology at the conservation charity. “Heatwaves and heavy rainfall are becoming more frequent and more intense. What we’re seeing in the UK, with the impacts of wildfires and severe storms such as Arwen, is how climate change is altering our landscapes for ever.” Lowlights of 2021 included wildfires taking hold at Marsden Moor in Yorkshire and the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland after long dry spells. In Yorkshire the habitat of birds such as the curlew, golden plover and short-eared owl was harmed, while in Northern Ireland skylark, meadow pipit and snipe, plus the Irish hare, were badly hit. In November Storm Arwen wreaked havoc on parts of northern Britain, uprooting thousands of trees including cherished specimens, such as a champion coast redwood at Bodnant Garden in north Wales. Warmer, wetter winters are resulting in diseases such as ash dieback taking hold and causing significant loss of trees, affecting landscapes and habitats. At least 30,000 ash trees are expected to be felled this winter because of ash dieback, at a cost of £3m, up from £2m last year, the National Trust says. On the Dorset coast, 90 metres of cliff crumbled in April, again probably because of the prolonged dry spell, changing the shape of that stretch of coast. It was a poor year for butterfly numbers, and scientists are still puzzling over the mysterious deaths of seabirds off the east coast. “Extreme events are putting even more pressure on Britain’s wildlife, which is already in trouble,” said McCarthy. “We finish the year with many places changed for ever by the recent storms, demonstrating the power of nature, the changing climate and how our role in its future is even more critical. “What is absolutely clear is that we need to tackle both the climate and nature crises as they are integrally linked and we need to make urgent progress with both. Our nature is part of what makes the UK unique and we must all play our part to protect it.” It may or may not turn out to be a good year for toads on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, the most south-westerly point of mainland Britain. Toadspawn was spotted as early as mid-November. If they are lucky, the toadlets will be off and independent before the puddles and ponds dry out in spring, but if not they may fall victim to frost. Wildflowers There were early hazel catkins in the winter and carpets of bee orchids in the summer at clifftop locations such as the Golden Cap estate in Dorset, thanks to a dry March and warm June, but further along the coast at Thorncombe Beacon, slippages of clay hit the beautiful populations of the pinkish herb common centaury. Butterflies Butterfly Conservation’s Big Butterfly Count recorded the lowest numbers since the event began 12 years ago. Some of the UK’s most loved species, including the small tortoiseshell and peacock butterflies, dropped. Numbers of the endangered large blue were down at National Trust sites in Somerset and Gloucestershire, where the species was introduced in 2019, because of the cool spring. Birds The chilly April and rain and gales in May led to a poor nesting season for many species. Barn owls abandoned nesting areas at Mount Stewart in Northern Ireland, while lapwings at Blakeney Freshes in Norfolk were put off by the cold ground conditions. In late summer guillemots and razorbills were found dead or dying along the east coast of Scotland and northern England. The reason remains unclear. Swallows, house martins and swifts arrived late in the season, probably put off by persistent northerly winds in the spring. Fungi A bumper year for grassland fungi, especially waxcaps, owing to a warm, damp autumn with little or no frost. In Herefordshire, conservationists discovered a striking alien species called devil’s fingers (also known as octopus stinkhorn) introduced to Europe accidentally from Australia or New Zealand. Seals, dormice and squirrels Grey seal colonies have had a good year, with pup numbers healthy thanks to the lack of predators and plentiful food. Dormice on the Holnicote estate in Exmoor did well, with good numbers seen during box checks in the autumn. Three red squirrel kittens were born on Brownsea Island in Dorset, one of the latest second litters the team has recorded. Interesting sights and sounds More than 100 species of spiders were recorded at Clumber park in Nottinghamshire, including the critically endangered diamond-backed spider. A small red-eyed damselfly was seen at Wenlock Edge in Shropshire, an indication that it is spreading north in response to climate change. An Italian tree cricket was heard singing at West Bexington in Dorset. This sound of the Mediterranean has been heard in Kent for several years and tree crickets now seem to be colonising other places.",News/Environment,How ‘new normal’ of wild weather put strain on UK nature in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/27/how-new-normal-of-wild-weather-put-strain-on-uk-nature-in-2021
12/27/2021,"The constellation of Perseus, the Greek hero, remains prominent at this time of year, and is well worth tracking down. The chart shows the view looking west from London at midnight on Monday, when the constellation will appear to be on its side. The star Atik marks Perseus’s ankle, and Mirfak, the brightest star in the constellation, marks either his elbow or part of his torso, depending on the artist.  Perseus is one of the original 48 constellations catalogued by the second-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy. In myth, he is the hero who saves Andromeda from Cetus, the sea monster, after she was chained to the rocks in punishment. He performed his feat by revealing the severed head of the gorgon Medusa to Cetus, turning the creature to stone. In some tellings of the myth, he rode the winged horse of Pegasus as part of the adventure. In the constellation, Medusa’s head is represented by the star Algol. In Arabic, the star’s full name is ra’s al-ghul, which means the ghoul’s head. Perseus can also be seen from much of the southern hemisphere. From Sydney, Australia, for example, the constellation just peeps over the northern horizon.",News/Science,Starwatch: ‘tis the season to be seeking out Perseus,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/27/starwatch-tis-the-season-to-be-seeking-out-perseus
12/27/2021,"Misty. Dank. Grim. Dusk falls just after you get up. December. I step on to the terrace for my daily minute of fresh air. Everything is hunkered down, biding its time. A single yellow leaf clings to the pear tree. Outlines of buildings are softened by grey. Despite its inviting appearance, the strip of lawn winding down to the shed is more bog than grass. Dog barks. Traffic rumbles. A robin gives the world the briefest ribbon of song.  Then silence. A south London morning. TSIB-A-TSAB-A-TSOO-DIDDY-DABBLE-IDDY-WODDA-TSIPP-A-BRRRR-TSIP-TSIP-TSIP-TSIP-TSIP-TJOP-TSRRRRRRRRRRR-TS’TJUPP-TJUPP-TJUPP-TJUPP! Mate, keep it down, will you? That quivering energy, electrifying the air. Your instinct is to look for something out in the open, medium-sized, obvious. But that piercing sound often comes from deep in a bush, and its producer is almost comically tiny. It is – what else? – the wren. Jenny to its friends, “hedge king” (Zaunkönig) if you’re German. I call it Tiny Shouter. They’re year-round singers – a rare thing. And there’s nothing quite like a wren – stub tail cocked at 90 degrees, belting out its song as if determined to jump-start the universe – to enliven a drab December day. Soul recharger in avian form. At this time of year, such an encounter brings to mind the Saint Stephen’s Day custom, particularly associated with Ireland and the Isle of Man, of “Hunting the Wren” – an old ritual which, to modern sensibilities, seems unnecessarily cruel. The wren – hunted, caught and either caged or killed before being paraded through the town – might have been punished for betraying Saint Stephen’s whereabouts, he being the first Christian martyr, or it might have been a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the year past and hope for the year to come. Nobody really knows the origins. Whatever they are, nowadays a fake wren stands in for the real thing. I wait, hoping for a repeat. I am partly rewarded. TSIB-A-TSAB-A-TSOO-DIDDY-DABBLE-IDDY.
