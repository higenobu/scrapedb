3/6/2022,"Actor Elizabeth Hurley paid tribute to her former fiance and “beloved Lionheart”, Shane Warne, as fresh details of the Australian cricket star’s sudden death in Thailand emerged. Hurley, who was engaged to Warne for more than two years until they split in December 2013, said that “the sun has gone behind a cloud forever”. Among other celebrities to pay tribute to Warne were musicians Elton John, Mick Jagger and Ed Sheeran, who revealed he spoke to his “amazing friend” just days before he died. Meanwhile, Thai police revealed that Warne had complained of chest pains in Australia before his trip to Thailand, saying the champion leg-spinner had a “record of heart symptoms”. The 52-year-old is believed to have died of a heart attack on Friday while on holiday in Koh Samui. Police superintendent Yuthana Sirisombat suggested that, after an autopsy, Warne’s body would be flown back to Australia, where prime minister Scott Morrison has offered a state funeral to the cricketer’s family. In Thailand police continued to piece together Warne’s final hours, with officers categorically ruling out drugs or “foul play” in relation to his death at the start of a three-month lay-off after covering the Ashes series for Fox Sports. Sirisombat said a masseur had visited Warne at the resort “but his condition was normal at that time so it’s not relevant.” Police are still waiting for CCTV footage to confirm Warne’s final movements, who was on a week-long holiday with three friends at the Samujana Villas resort. Warne had retired to his room on Friday afternoon to watch coverage of the Australia-Pakistan test, with plans for drinks and dinner at 5pm. When he failed to appear, his friends had knocked on Warne’s door at 5.15pm and found him unresponsive. Warne’s business manager, Andrew Neophitou, was attempting CPR when medics arrived. Phet Boonrak, chief of the local rescue team, said: “When we got there, the person was unconscious and had a weak pulse, so we tried to do CPR and call the ambulance. “His friends were so shocked, they said they found him unconscious. Once the ambulance arrived they took him to the hospital immediately.” Chatchawin Nakmusik, of Bo Phut Police on Koh Samui, said: “The villa manager took me to check at the scene. There are several rooms in that villa. His friends told me that Shane was sleeping in his bedroom in the afternoon. Later on, when they wanted to have dinner, they went to call him but he already passed out. They informed the villa management and called the ambulance. They tried to do CPR but Shane was already dead.” Four days ago on Instagram, Warne shared his plan to lose weight and get back to his peak physical condition, telling his 1.3 million followers: “Operation shred has started (10 days in) & the goal by July is to get back to this shape from a few years ago! Let’s go.” Among the many tributes to Warne included one from the Barmy Army, England’s supporters club, who described the Australian as a “complete genius” and “one of the game’s greatest characters” who is “forever etched in Ashes history”. The England cricket team posted on Twitter: “One of the greatest of all-time. A legend. A genius. You changed Cricket. RIP Shane Warne”. The former India captain, Sachin Tendulkar, said he was “shocked and stunned” by the news. “There was never a dull moment with you around, on or off the field. Will always treasure our on field duels and off-field banter. You always had a special place for India and Indians had a special place for you. Gone too young!”",Sport/Sport,Elizabeth Hurley mourns ‘Lionheart’ Shane Warne after shock death,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/06/elizabeth-hurley-mourns-lionheart-shane-warne-after-shock-death
3/6/2022,"It started, at least in terms of the public’s recognition, with a giant spending spree that reads like a Christmas wishlist for a billionaire. Picasso’s Women of Algiers for $179m; $100m to fund the production budget of Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street and a $600,000 Oscar statuette given to Marlon Brando for best actor in On the Waterfront – a gift for the movie’s star Leonardo DiCaprio. But it did not stop there: there was also a custom-built megayacht; a Beverly Hills hotel; a $415m stake in EMI music publishing; and a transparent grand piano. The money had come from 1MDB, a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund connected to Malaysia’s then prime minister, Najib Razak, that had been looted of $4.4bn by then 34-year-old Low Taek Jho, known as Jho Low. Najib was himself accused of receiving $681m from 1MDB – a claim he has denied – while Low, subject to an Interpol red alert and believed to be in China, struck a deal to return $1bn under the US Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. Low said the settlement was a “a successful and satisfactory result”. The astonishing 1MDB swindle has now reached Brooklyn federal court in one of the most remarkable cases to hit New York’s justice system in years. It has it all: Hollywood, corruption, some of the biggest names in arts, business and politics and eye-popping sums of money. According to prosecutors, Low, and two bankers from Goldman Sachs, the most prestigious of US investment banks which reported $21.64bn in net earnings last year, conspired to pay $1bn in bribes to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi government officials, in order to win Goldman $6.5bn in bond offerings. For the past two weeks, the one-time Goldman Sachs star banker Tim Leissner, 50, has been testifying against a former head of Goldman in Malaysia, Roger Ng, 49, who has pleaded not guilty to laundering billions of dollars embezzled from the fund, known formally as 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Sixteen months ago Goldman pleaded guilty to a criminal charge and paid $5bn in fines for its role in the fraud that Ng’s own lawyers, in attempting to shift responsibility to Low, have called it “perhaps the single largest heist in the history of the world”. The trial has produced some surprising moments, among them Leissner’s claim that Low claimed to have a “dialogue” in Beijing with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, and others in Trump’s inner circle to shut down the 1MDB inquiries. A person familiar with Kushner’s schedule told Bloomberg Kushner had never met with Low or spoken to him during his time in the White House. But a top Republican fundraiser had. In 2020, Elliott Broidy pleaded guilty to illegally lobbying the administration on Low’s behalf for a fee of $6m – with $100m more to come if the case was dropped. But the case has raised eyebrows for other reasons. Leissner, once of Goldman’s highest-flying executives who paid $43.7m in fines as part of his plea, has had his credibility challenged on the stand by Ng’s lawyers, who claimed that he he was married to two different women when he married Kimora Lee Simmons, the model, reality TV star and Baby Phat designer, in 2014. On the stand, the German-born former chairman of Goldman’s south-east Asia division confirmed that – while in the middle of seeking a quick divorce from his first wife without her knowledge in the early 2000s – he wed a Goldman colleague. “Tim Leissner uses people,” Ng’s defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo told jurors last month. He was “married to two different women at the same time, twice” and that he had an “illicit” relationship with another, Agnifilo said in opening statements. “I have lied a lot sir, and I have regretted those choices,” Leissner said under cross-examination this week. Last week, Ng’s lawyers asked trial judge Margo Brodie to allow evidence that Simmons, the ex-wife of the hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, helped Leissner launder at least $80m stolen from 1MDB. Simmons is the registered owner of shell companies in Seychelles, Delaware and California used by Leissner to launder cash obtained from a “Kuwaiti sheikh”, Ng’s attorneys claimed in court documents. Simmons lawyers have said their client did nothing wrong – and that communications between Simmons and Leissner are protected under marital privilege laws. But Ng’s attorneys said that privilege doesn’t apply since her ex-husband admitted he forged divorce papers to marry her. But the stunning details of the case and the distractions of the luxury lifestyles on display throughout the 1MDB saga, obscure what may be the government’s central purpose. According to sources close to Leissner, the government is looking to personalize corporate crime. After the 2008 market crash, that saw the destruction of Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and the UK lender Northern Rock, there were no prosecutions of executives who greenlit reckless lending policies. Instead, taxpayers shouldered the bail-outs and – subject to stricter balance sheet requirements – the banking system went on its way. But a 2015 memo by the then deputy US attorney general, Sally Yates, enunciated a new guidelines. “A corporation only acts through individuals, investigating the conduct of individuals is the most efficient and effective way to determine the facts and extent of any corporate misconduct,” Yates wrote. The memo was updated in 2020 with a set of principles, that argued individual accountability “deters future illegal activity, incentivizes changes in corporate behavior, ensures that the proper parties are held responsible for their actions, and promotes the public’s confidence in our justice system”. That instruction, in broad terms, accounts for the recent challenges to an immunity deal reached by some members of the Sackler family as part of the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy action; FBI raids on two homes – one in Washington and one in New York – connected to sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska in October last year; and efforts to turn the Trump Organization CFO, Allen Weisselberg, against his boss, the former US president. “Corporations are fictions – they act only because people in positions of authority are causing the company to act in ways that result in corporate criminal conduct,” said Rick Mountcastle, assistant attorney general for Virginia, who led the investigation and prosecution of Purdue Pharma and three executives. “There’s not much deterrent in prosecuting a corporation. The corporation gets fined, it’s a cost-of-doing-business, and there’s no incentive for that corporation or others to change their conduct. So it’s good policy to penalize corporations for corporate criminal conduct, but also hold individuals for causing or allowing it to take place.” But the 1MDB conspiracy prosecution in Brooklyn poses a number of unanswered questions. Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said the prosecutorial effort involved in putting Ng on trial may suggest the government is looking to “hook bigger fish” than either the defendant or Leissner. “Usually, the prosecution of lower-level individuals is not the ultimate goal. They’re usually looking for individuals in the organization who created a culture who allowed this to occur or that may have sanctioned this,” Elson said Ng’s lawyers contend their client is a scapegoat for “corporate-wide” failures at Goldman that enabled the fraud. In its deal with prosecutors, the bank looked to recoup or withhold more than $100m in executive compensation from former chief executive Lloyd Blankfein and cut the 2020 pay package of current CEO David Solomon one-third to $10m. The larger question may be how the scandal affects Goldman’s reputation. The bank has been attempting to stay out of the spotlight ever since Blankfein made an ill-timed remark about “doing God’s work” and US reporter Matt Taibbi described as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money”. In court last week, attorneys for both the government and Goldman were keeping a watchful eye on the proceedings. “It’s popular from a political standpoint, because financial firms never engender great love from the public,” said Elson, “and it sends the message that no one is over the law. Other, less connected firms, should certainly be concerned.”",News/US news,"The New York trial that has it all: Hollywood, megayachts, giant sums of money",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/1mdb-trial-new-york-corruption

I would have thought that some small element of the cultural bit of her title might include being able to spell properly. The unpleasantness doesn’t stop there.

3/6/2022,"Country music – with its songs about love and loss, trucks and tequila, beers and bust-ups – has long been the melodic backdrop to rural and small town America. Now it’s booming in Britain too. One look at the digital streaming numbers tells the story. They’ve shot up almost 50% in the past two years, according to new data from the Country Music Association – making country the fastest growing music genre in Britain. It’s the “authenticity” of singers such as Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash – and more recently Taylor Swift and Kacey Musgraves – that country music DJ Baylen Leonard believes is at the heart of Britain’s newfound love for all things Nashville. “People are looking for something that’s a little more grounded, that has a start, that has a finish, that takes you somewhere,” he says. “For some people, it’s nostalgic or escapist – taking you out of the situation you’re in – maybe on some sundrenched holiday to the American south.” It’s helped by a slew of new specialist radio stations such as Absolute Radio Country, Smooth Country, Downtown Country and Chris Country Radio, each churning out round-the-clock Nashville vibes. Weekly radio listeners are edging close to 1 million – but for Leonard it’s less about the numbers and more about what he’s seeing on the ground. He points out that the roofers next door to his building are tuned into a country music station all day and every day. “They were listening to Luke Combs and singing along to every single word,” he says. “Dentists, taxis, coffee shops – people are tuned into country everywhere. It’s all about the storytelling – I think country music does that better than any genre out there.” And there’s perhaps no one better at stories than Dolly Parton. Leonard believes her appearance at Glastonbury in 2014 was a huge moment for country music in this country. “I think it was a reminder of just how amazing Dolly Parton is, and opened people’s eyes to how country music has got this real heart to it,” he says. “You can put on Jolene or 9 to 5 in lany situation with any crowd and you’re going to get people singing along to every single word. People love the glitter and rhinestones too.” In the past, British audiences often dismissed country music as being conservative or regressive, he says, and while some of those old-school singers are still around, growing numbers of liberal-minded artists “want to make the world a better place”. He points to voices like Kacey Musgraves – a multi-Grammy winning country star with a reputation for “pushing social barriers”. Her song Follow Your Arrow, for example, is about being free to love who you want. He thinks British country fans roughly fall into three categories. The loud and proud set – who might have come into the genre via Taylor Swift or the hit TV show Nashville. “They love the lifestyle, they want to go to Nashville, to wear the red, white and blue, and get a cowboy hat,” he says. Then there are what he calls the “closet country fans” – who keep their passion for country quiet in case they’re made fun of. Last, there are those who wouldn’t classify themselves as country fans but who nonetheless love Johnny Cash. Fans from all camps will be heading to country music festivals this year, from the south to the Scottish isles. The biggest, Country to Country, opens this week – a three-day multi-venue event that has become Europe’s very own Nashville extravaganza. Tens of thousands are expected to turn out as the festival takes in such unlikely cowboy hotspots as London, Dublin and Glasgow. One of the headline acts is 28-year-old Scotty McCreery – who won American Idol in 2011, and part of the new generation of platinum-selling country singers, fusing traditional Nashville sounds with their own modern twist. Growing up in a small town in North Carolina, McCreery says he spent hours every day in his bedroom, soaking up the ballads of his mother’s favourite country singers, including Conway Twitty, Randy Travis and Merle Haggard. There wasn’t much else to do, he says. “I grew up in a southern Baptist church – it was Jesus and fried chicken, that’s what life was all about.” It’s a life that might sound a long way from Essex or the Midlands – where two more of the UK’s new country festivals are taking place, Tennessee Fields in July and The Long Road over the August bank holiday – but the sentiments are universal, he says. “People listen to the songs and see their own life,” he says. “People come up to me all the time and say, ‘man, this song reminds me of my family – or, we walked down the aisle with that song’. It’s real people telling real stories.” Real stories like his hit, Five More Minutes With You, which he wrote after the unexpected death of his grandfather and which has been streamed 143m times on Spotify alone. “It’s about wanting to spend one more day with him – just to get to tell him a few more things,” McCreery says. “I think that’s a story a lot of us can relate to with loved ones.”",Arts/Music,Why Britain is taking country music to its achy-breaky heart ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/06/why-britain-is-taking-country-music-to-its-achy-breaky-heart
3/6/2022,"Superyachts seek safe havens. Property portfolios dissolve. Lawyers are engaged, accountants contracted. Politicians confect plausible denials over ostentatious donations. Tory party co-chairman Ben Elliot deletes online boasts of his company’s “15 years’ experience providing luxury lifestyle management services to Russia’s elite and corporate members”. It seems there were oligarchs everywhere, all along. We’ve been living in an oligarchy, and no one knew, except all the silenced journalists and stifled inquiries that tried to tell us. Six years ago, after meeting him at a urinal, I briefly befriended the now penitent oligarch Roman Abramovich. Ten songs into a brilliant set by Americana legends the Long Ryders at Under the Bridge, the venue attached to the football ground Abramovich owned, I dashed to the gents, just after Ivory Tower and during The Light Gets in the Way, my prostate gland and my enthusiasm for plangent country rock in mortal combat. “That Ivory Tower song is so good. We do live in an Ivory Tower,” the urinating oligarch next to me moaned drunkenly in an anglicised Russian accent, “And an Ivory Tower can fall down, any time, my friend! Fantasticheskiy!” And with that, the edified oligarch began to weep hot tears that splashed down into the urinal bowl, diluting the champagne-flavoured micturate his tiny penis had squirted weakly there. I am not a fan of football, kleptocracies or smelting. I did not know I was being addressed by the oligarch, and newly converted Long Ryders fan, Roman Abramovich. “I agree,” I said, innocently. “The Long Ryders work within the country rock genre, I suppose, but they invest it with levels of real tenderness, insight and originality, magically greater than the sum of its parts.” “You are an intellectual, my fat companion. A shoe-shine boy of the elite. You overanalyse,” said my new oligarch friend, suddenly stabilising. “I never knew this group before, but the sound is Clash, but on a farm! Makes Robbie Williams seem shit.” “Have you seen Robbie Williams live?” I asked politely, zipping up my flies, and wondering how a Russian Robbie Williams fan had found his way into a reunion show by some not well-known 80s alternative country pioneers. “Williams played the New Year’s Eve party I threw for Vladimir Putin two years ago. Then he writes an offensive song obviously about me and the loans-for-shares privatisation programme: ‘It takes a certain kind of man with a certain reputation to alleviate the cash from a whole entire nation.’ Happy to take my money though, eh? Asshole! I should sue him. Like Catherine Belton and HarperCollins in the future. At least I was never in Take That!” Now I was confused. “You threw a party for Putin? Who are you?” Without washing his hands, my oligarch companion clasped my face in his palms. “You do not know who I am? Ha! Fantasticheskiy!” And then he kissed each of my cheeks in turn. “Come Shoe-shine! We’ll drink champagne. You explain this ‘alternative country’ to me and watch the cowboy farm band, yes?” As we were served, very quickly, at the bar, the Long Ryders kicked into the countrified powerpop of their signature NRBQ cover, I Want You Bad. “Fantasticheskiy,” enthused Abramovich, as a woman poured us champagne, “But I have never heard them before. Their failure to penetrate the wider marketplace is surely due to poor business decisions by record labels in the 80s. All is business. I bought a painting of a big woman for £17m. George Lucas, yes? I invited him to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers play at my 2011 New Year’s party. Ideal party band. Those Ewoks in Return of Jedi, yes? They are no fucking good. I asked Lucas, ‘The Ewoks are Wookiees, yes, from the other two films, the good films? Compare the meerkat. You changed Wookiees for the new small creatures to sell more toys to morons?’ Lucas said nothing. All is business. What song is the group playing now?” “State of My Union,” I reply, fizzing, “I suppose, both musically and lyrically, it has an ironic relationship with rock’n’roll songs that eulogise a particular place, like the Beach Boys’ California Girls, the humour here deriving from the fact that it concerns the unglamorous state of Kentucky.” “Enough, Shoe-shine!” honked Abramovich, “they’re leaving the stage. Clap for an encore.” “Ivory Tower! Ivory Tower!” commanded Abramovich, a man not used to having his wishes disobeyed, but the spritely roots veterans sprang instead into a spirited reading of their near hit, the British invasion hued American history lesson Looking for Lewis and Clark. “This song is good. The harmonica break excites me,” concluded Abramovich as the Long Ryders left that stage, and we headed to the exits. “But it’s no Ivory Tower. Hey! Shoe-shine,” and Abramovich threw his arm around me as we walked through the Chelsea grounds in the cool summer night, “Ivory Tower. Sing that song for me, now.” “Really,” I asked, “just here now, unaccompanied? I don’t know if … ” “Sing the fucking song, Shoe-shine, and earn your champagne!” growled Abramovich, so I summoned some inner strength, stood up straight and sang: “My friend lives in an ivory tower. She don’t listen when you try to tell her: ‘it’s too late, your ivory tower’s falling down.’” The notes faded and Abramovich sat down near a seagull on top of a dirty bin, gazing at the stars. He seemed momentarily moved, as if about to admit something, but then snapped back into certainty. “Hmm,” concluded Abramovich, “This Ivory Tower needs a checkpoint entry, crash barriers, iron gates, like Kensington Palace Gardens. Or expensive litigation lawyers. Some donations to a charitable fund. Etc. Then the Ivory Tower will not fall. Go home Shoe-shine. Home to your stinking book-lined cave.” Rescheduled national 2022 dates of Stewart’s 2020 tour, Snowflake Tornado, are on sale now; as are Edinburgh fringe shows.

3/6/2022,"Tyler Hollinger, owner of Festivál Cafe, a “farm-to-bar cocktail cafe” in New York City, said he recently started learning Brazilian jiu-jitsu because of physical altercations with visitors who are unvaccinated against Covid-19. The reason for the fights isn’t that Hollinger is a crusader for the city’s requirement that people show proof of vaccination to sit inside at bars and restaurants. In fact, Hollinger, who is vaccinated and boosted, has opposed the mandate since it was announced in August and now welcomes the plan to lift it. The city “could have denied people access to the [Metropolitan Transportation Authority], buses and subways for not being vaccinated, but instead they put the burden on small businesses … which directly harms our bottom line and only helps the city”, said Hollinger, who opened his restaurant in September 2020, meaning it has only existed during the pandemic. As New York City and other government entities begin to lift vaccination requirements, many in the hospitality industry say they welcome the moves and think they will help restaurants and bars. “We need to be smart and safe but continue to live our lives, and we can’t continue such strict mandates indefinitely when there isn’t as strong a justification for them anymore,” said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance. But at the same time some experts worry that lifting the restrictions too soon or too fully presents a serious health risk. After all, the pandemic is not over, there are still millions of vulnerable Americans who are unvaccinated and a new variant could rapidly arise at almost any time. In New York, which has been buffeted by the virus more than perhaps any other American city, all those tensions are playing out. When then New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced workers and patrons would need to show proof of vaccination at indoor dining, gyms and entertainment venues, he said, “If you want to participate in our society fully, you’ve got to get vaccinated.” Since then, Covid case, hospitalization and death numbers that spiked during the Omicron wave and have plummeted. Mayor Eric Adams announced on 27 February that the city would lift the requirements on 7 March if Covid indicators remained low. New York has already in recent weeks seen a significant increase in the number of people booking hotels, and the lifting of the mandate will help that trend, said Chris Heywood, a spokesman for NYC & Company, the city’s tourism agency. More than 60% of the city’s hotel rooms were occupied the week ending 26 February, which was an almost 20% increase from a month earlier, but still significantly below the 90% occupancy rate reached in 2019, according to the hotel-analytics firm STR. “I think there is an industry-wide effort to get us back to a sense of normalcy, to lift any unnecessary restrictions because that will signal to people that it’s time to return to normalcy, that the country is open for business and that it’s OK to travel now,” said Heywood. But Dr Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center, continues to worry about a new variant emerging that catches people by surprise like Omicron did. By waiting another month or two to lift restrictions such as the vaccine mandate, he said, we would gain “perhaps more time to get more people vaccinated in other parts of the world, which would reduce the evolution of new variants”. “I personally would like to see us continue” the proof of vaccination requirement, “but I realize how hard it is to really enforce that, how much pushback there has been”, said Morse. “It’s unfortunate that it has become so politicized.” Dr Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said she is “baffled” by the decision to lift the mandate. People in bars and restaurants are often close together “and obviously it’s a setting where people cannot wear a mask since they are eating and drinking”, El-Sadr said. “I don’t think it’s an onerous requirement and as people are moving around and mixing and coming from other parts of the country, it makes the requirement for vaccination become more important.” But Rigie points to the fact that New York was one of a handful of cities that implemented such a requirement – and that other American cities have also dropped their restrictions. San Francisco still has a proof of vaccine mandate. Even once the city lifts the mandates, some restaurateurs have said they still plan to ask guests for proof of vaccination to dine indoors. “I think individual businesses will have to make decisions that work for themselves, their employees and their customers,” Rigie said. Jeremy Wladis, president of The Restaurant Group, which operates a number of eateries on the Upper West Side, said he and his partners considered continuing to check people’s vaccination status once the requirement is lifted but decided against it because of concerns that some people’s response may be, “Hey, it’s over. Stop bothering me.” “I think it’s going to be more people coming in than we have had in a couple years,” said Wladis, who owns restaurants such as Nina’s Great Burrito Bar and Harvest Kitchen. “There is no way to please everybody all the time.” Even once the city lifts the requirement, Hollinger, the Festivál Cafe owner, said that will not solve all his problems at the restaurant. He said it’s been hurt by the increase in crime and the number of people experiencing homelessness that has occurred during the pandemic. But if more people return to bars and restaurants, “there is no crime because there are too many people watching”, said Hollinger. I hope “there is going to be a resurgence this spring and summer where people feel safe to go out and party, to have fun … That’s the whole reason people live in New York City, is because of the world class food and drinks.”",News/US news,New York City’s restaurant industry grapples with easing vaccine rules,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/new-york-citys-restaurant-industry-grapples-with-easing-vaccine-rules
3/6/2022,"For the Michigan congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, it was a question from her husband: “When is our time?” For the North Carolina congressman David Price, it was the judgment that “the time has come” to step down. Some retiring Democrats have blamed the gridlock and dysfunction on Capitol Hill while others point to the redrawing of congressional maps. Still, others cite the rise of political extremism and the deteriorating relations between members of Congress, particularly in the wake of the January 6 insurrection. Announcing his decision to retire last year, the Wisconsin congressman, Ron Kind, was frank: “The truth is, I’ve run out of gas.” The decision not to seek re-election is both deeply personal and political. But as the party braces for a grueling midterm election in November, a rising number of House Democrats are opting not to return to Congress next year. On Monday, the Florida congressman Ted Deutch announced that he would not seek re-election, bringing the total number of Democratic departures from the House so far this cycle to 31. Among them, eight Democrats are seeking other offices next year, like Tim Ryan of Ohio, who is running for the Senate, and Karen Bass of California, who is running to be the mayor of Los Angeles. Some retiring members are powerful veterans,such as Kentucky’s John Yarmuth, chair of the budget committee and Oregon’s Peter DeFazio, chair of the transportation and infrastructure committee. Others represent politically competitive districts, like Stephanie Murphy of Florida and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona. It’s a worrying trend for Democrats. Congressional retirements are often an early sign of a wave election – for the other party. In 2018, dozens of House Republicans did not seek re-election, including the then House majority leader, Paul Ryan. The party lost 41 seats that year, and Democrats gained control of the chamber, in an election cycle widely viewed as a referendum on Donald Trump. This year, the political winds are reversed. Republicans are trumpeting each retirement as a sign that Democrats’ hopes of keeping their majority are fading. “Their majority is doomed,” the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman, Mike Berg, said recently. “Retire or lose.” Though many vacancies are in safely Democratic districts, the rush of retirements come as the party faces significant historical headwinds. The president’s party almost always loses seats in the midterm elections. And in the House, Democrats can only afford to lose a handful of seats before surrendering control. With Biden’s sagging approval ratings, Democrats’ agenda stalled, public discontent over the economy and inflation, and Republicans’ strong performance in a series of off-cycle elections, the political landscape looks grim for the party in power. Adding to the uncertainty is the once-a-decade redistricting process when a state’s congressional and legislative districts are redrawn. The House is often a reflection of the national American mood, which public opinion polls show is pessimistic. Voters are frustrated with their political leaders and the party is bracing for a backlash. In polling that asks voters which party they would support on an election day – as opposed to which congressional candidate – Republicans repeatedly hold the edge. In an interview, Price, 81, said his decision leave Congress after three decades was “mainly personal” and not circumstantial. During the Trump years, he said many long-serving Democrats postponed the decision to retire because they believed their experience was needed on Capitol Hill. Now they feel the time is right. Price’s new district is rated safely Democratic, and after a long redistricting battle, the North Carolina state supreme court recently approved congressional maps that are favorable to the party. “I would suggest they don’t bring out the champagne quite yet,” he said of Republicans. “This redistricting in our state and a lot of states is turning out not to be quite the windfall for them that they thought.” Though Democrats have fared far better than expected in the redistricting process, it was still a factor in some decisions to retire or seek another office. “The number of retirements is naturally higher in years that end in ‘two’ because those are redistricting cycles,” said Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. It’s been a brutal experience for some. Congressman Jim Cooper witnessed his reliably Democratic Nashville seat being carved up into three different districts that Trump would have easily won in 2020. He decried the move as “raw politics” and an effort to dilute the electoral power of Black voters. A day after the Tennessee legislature approved the map, Cooper announced his retirement from Congress, where he had served for more than three decades. “I explored every possible way, including lawsuits, to stop the gerrymandering and to win one of the three new congressional districts that now divide Nashville,” he said. “There’s no way, at least for me in this election cycle, but there may be a path for other worthy candidates.” John Rogers, a Republican pollster who was the executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee during the 2018 midterm elections cycle, says the retirements of powerful and long-serving Democrats is a strong sign that the party is bracing for defeat in November. “There are too many committee chairs retiring for this to be just about redistricting,” he said, adding that the prospect of losing a gavel or ending a lengthy career in the minoritywas unattractive to some politicians. Retirements deprive a party of the advantages that come with incumbency: fundraising, name recognition and a deep understanding of their constituency, factors that are especially critical in competitive seats. “Incumbency is not as valuable as it used to be,” said Kondik, author of The Long Red Thread: How Democratic Dominance Gave Way to Republican Advantage in US House Elections. “But open seats are generally harder to defend, particularly in a wave-style environment.” Not since 1992 have so many House Democrats opted not to seek re-election. And with states still finalizing their congressional maps and candidate filing deadlines approaching, there might be more retirements to come. “However bad it is to serve in Congress, it’s worse to serve in the minority,” Kondik said, “particularly in the House.” Notably bucking the trend, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has announced her decision to run again, extinguishing speculation that she would retire at the end of the term. Pelosi was re-elected as speaker after agreeing to step down from the role by the end of 2022. The Republican retirements, though far fewer, are also telling. As of this week, 15 House Republicans have said they won’t run for re-election, with seven running for another office. Among them are more moderate members including Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and John Katko of New York, who have faced conservative backlash for voting to impeach Trump. Democrats argue that much could change before the November elections. The Covid-19 pandemic appears to be in retreat, and the economy remains strong, despite inflation. Biden has started to ramp up his travel around the country touting his legislative accomplishments. He has received rare bipartisan praise for his handling of the crisis in Ukraine and Democratic voters are excited about his nominee for the supreme court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is poised to become the first Black woman to serve on the bench after her confirmation hearings later this month. And Republicans, they say, will have to answer for Trump’s enduring control over their party and the fallout from the congressional investigation into the events of January 6, as well as for their efforts to restrict access to abortion and the ballot, issues Democrats believe will rally voters to their side this cycle. “Most midterms by their nature are referenda on a party of power,” said Ian Russell, a Democratic strategist and former national political director with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But he said that by embracing Trump’s lies about election fraud and refusing to sanction their most extreme members, Republicans are helping frame the election as a choice between “two parties with very different priorities, one of which is going to wind up in charge”. Last month, Lawrence, the Michigan congresswoman, surprised some of her colleagues when she announced that she would retire at the end of the term, after more than three decades in public service. “After four years of Donald Trump’s administration, Covid, January 6, it was a death by a million cuts,” she said in an interview. Lawrence, who represents a heavily Democratic district and is the only Black member of Michigan’s congressional delegation, said she “feels good” about her legacy and would continue to be active in her community in other ways: “I’m not going home to plant flowers.” She hopes her departure will make room for a new generation of Black lawmakers, who will bring fresh urgency to the battles over women’s reproductive rights, voting protections and police reform. “I came into Congress when we were in the minority,” she said. “But I came in with the intent to make a difference, and I hope that that continues to motivate American citizens to step up into public service – because there is work to do.”",News/US news,Wave of House Democratic retirements stokes fears for party’s election prospects,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/democrats-retirements-election-2022-brenda-lawrence
3/6/2022,"AGL Energy has rejected a higher takeover bid from Canadian asset manager Brookfield and tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, potentially seeing off the unsolicited bid. The pair made an offer of $8.25 a share for Australia’s largest electricity generator on Friday night, topping their initial offer of $7.50 made last month, multiple sources told Guardian Australia. AGL’s board met on Sunday and decided to reject the second offer, worth about $8.5bn, when the company’s debt of about $3bn is included. It is understood Brookfield, which was to stump up 80% of the bid, planned to walk away from further bids if the board rejected the bid. Grok Ventures, the family investment arm of Cannon-Brookes, was to hold the remain 20% stake and it too was expected to give up its push given the rejection. Cannon-Brookes confirmed as much on social media on Sunday evening. The initial audacious bid had drawn opposition from the AGL board, which claimed it materially undervalued the company. The reasons for the second rejection will be made public before the ASX opens on Monday morning. It’s understood that AGL’s board believed the higher offer also failed to take into account the company’s value, particularly after it breaks into a two separate companies in July. The suitors had promised to accelerate AGL’s exit from coal, quickening the closure of all three coal plants by 2030 and making Australia’s biggest single greenhouse gas emitter carbon neutral by 2035. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, also opposed an acceleration of the coal exit, saying assets should be “sweated” until the design date of their closure. AGL already plans to shut its Liddell plant in the Hunter Valley of NSW by April 2023. Last month it said it would close its sister plant no later than 2035, and its Loy Yang A coal plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley by no later than 2045. All three companies were approached for comment. While Brookfield may be indicating it would give up if the revised bid was rejected, one source questioned whether it might be tempted back if – as is expected – AGL’s shared take a plunge when trading resumes. Interest in the company’s 4.5 million-strong customer base had been accentuated by the bid, and other suitors might make a tilt for the company even if Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes weren’t involved, one source speculated.",News/Business,"AGL rejects higher bid from Mike Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield, potentially ending takeover push",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/agl-rejects-higher-bid-from-mike-cannon-brookes-and-brookfield-potentially-ending-takeover-push
3/6/2022,"A world-class ceramics centre should be created in Stoke-on-Trent to capitalise on renewed interest in the subject from shows such as The Great Pottery Throw Down, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum has said. Tristram Hunt said a recent outcry over proposed council cuts to pottery museums in the city showed the growing level of interest in Britain’s ceramics industry and its heritage. “Having seen the incredible national and international response to these proposals, the council has a great opportunity,” said Hunt. “There’s a strong case for bringing together the great ceramics collections of the Midlands into a ceramic centre which draws on the incredible history of the area, but is also connected to a growing demand for making and throwing and firing, all of the stuff we have seen in Pottery Throw Down. “The V&A would be very supportive of that and it would be something good to come out of all this trauma.” The final of the increasingly popular Channel 4 show, which is filmed at the Gladstone Pottery Museum in Stoke-on-Trent, takes place on Sunday. Hunt, who has written a book on pottery pioneer Josiah Wedgwood and was the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, said The Great Pottery Throw Down is helping to fuel interest in the city and more should be done to boost its tourism offering. In January, the city council announced proposals for its 2022-23 budget, which included cutting museum service funding by £479,000, and scrapping a number of staff roles across the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery and the Gladstone museum, including the posts of senior and assistant curator of ceramics. It also said it planned to close the Gladstone museum for five months every year, from November to March, for filming, venue hire and events. After a backlash in the UK and abroad, with more than 250 written submissions and a petition signed by more than 20,000 people, the council rowed back on its proposals, saying it would “pause” plans to cut the curator positions, and would open the Gladstone museum over Christmas and in the February half-term. Local campaigners and heritage groups said they welcomed the partial retreat but “many questions and concerns remain”. “These plans effectively hollow out the museums. There has been a huge outcry,” said Peter Wilson, chair of the Friends of the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery. “A number of people, including some of our members, who have indicated they will donate their collection of pottery to the museum in their will, were saying they were not sure of doing that now, because they were not sure the council were going to care about it.” Alasdair Brooks, chief executive of the charity Re-Form Heritage and the Middleport Pottery in the city, also said he had concerns the plans could “potentially damage the international prominence and international interest in the ceramics heritage” of the city. He said The Great Pottery Throw Down, as well the recent British drama The Colour Room about ceramic artist Clarice Cliff, had boosted interest in Stoke-on-Trent across the world. “Even during the pandemic, almost every time I went down to the shop we would have a group of east Asian tourists. As we slowly ease travel restrictions around the world, I think there’s going to be an increasing demand,” he said. “Our visitor numbers in 2021 were on average up by 56% where we were able to make a direct month-for-month comparison with 2019. While stay-at-home holidays may have had a significant impact on that in the UK, Pottery Throw Down is shown in the US and The Colour Room will have some level of international distribution. I think there is pent-up growing interest around the world.” Hunt said he wanted to see more investment in heritage tourism in the city. “Going up to Stoke and throwing some pottery should become more of an experience,” he said. “There’s this new commitment from the government for Arts Council expenditure outside London, and to my mind, creating a ceramics centre in Stoke seems a perfect opportunity to think about that.”",Arts/Culture,"Stoke has missed chance to capitalise on its pottery heritage, says V&A boss",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/06/stoke-has-missed-chance-to-capitalise-on-its-pottery-heritage-says-va-boss
3/6/2022,"Neil Simpson claimed Britain’s first gold medal of the 2022 Beijing Winter Paralympics with victory in the men’s Super-G vision impaired class. The 19-year-old, who is guided by his brother Andrew, finished 0.40 seconds ahead of Italian Giacomo Bertagnolli to go into first place, and then had to wait at the foot of the hill to see if anybody else could beat his time. No one could. “Initially when we came down and Andrew said we had gone in to first place, there was a bit of an anxious wait,” said Simpson, who was born with nystagmus, which causes involuntary eye movements. “I wasn’t thinking about it being a winning performance, I was just thinking that it was a good run. We put it all down on the line and really went for it and I’m just very happy with the performance.” His guide Andrew told Channel 4: “It’s amazing to win it with my brother. It’s something we’ve been working towards for a long, long time, and you know, even to get to the Paralympics is a real honour.” Neil Simpson said that it was an advantage having his brother as his guide, explaining: “You are able to be very clear and concise in what you want, even direct and blunt sometimes. You don’t have to beat around the bush, so that definitely helps.” It is the first time any British male athlete has won a gold medal on snow at a Winter Paralympics. Menna Fitzpatrick, 23, added a silver for ParalympicsGB in the women’s Super-G vision impaired class. Fitzpatrick had a torrid build-up to the Games, recovering from a broken leg in March 2020 and then losing her regular guide Katie Guest who could not attend Beijing due to a positive Covid test before her departure from the UK. The silver is the fifth medal of her career, making her Britain’s most successful Winter Paralympian. “To be here at all is a great achievement,” she said after the race. “But to stand up on that podium is absolutely amazing. I’m so proud of what we’ve achieved together.” Gary Smith had stepped in as guide at the last moment. He told Channel 4: “I was so happy with how Menna had done in the downhill [where she finished fifth on Saturday], and I just kept on telling her how much I believed in her and how much she could do. I was really proud of it today.” Fitzpatrick’s teammate Millie Knight narrowly missed out on a second medal at these Games, finishing just 0.09 seconds behind bronze medallist Zhu Daqing of China. The gold went to Alexandra Rexova of Slovakia. That bronze medal was just one of a slew for the hosts on day two of the sporting action. China have taken the lead in the medal table with six gold, four silver and six bronze medals. The nation had previously only ever won one gold medal at a Winter Paralympics. One of those victories included a shock in the women’s long distance cross-country where Yang Hongqiong finished over 30 seconds ahead of heavy favourite and serial gold medal winner Oksana Masters of the US. Zheng Peng won gold in the men’s event to make it a double celebration for China at the Zhangjiakou National Biathlon Centre. James Barnes-Miller of ParalympicsGB has qualified for Monday’s snowboard cross upper limbs division finals, while Owen Pick and Ollie Hill have reached the next stage in the LL2 lower limb category. Norway, who dominated events at the Winter Olympics, have their first gold of these Games, with Jesper Pedersen’s victory in the men’s sitting super-G. Corey Peters of New Zealand took silver, adding to his gold from Saturday. The 41-year-old Taiki Morii of Japan secured bronze, as he did in Saturday’s downhill race. He now has five career medals, his first being silver in the giant slalom at the 2006 Turin Paralympics. The US para ice hockey team, the defending champions, guaranteed their passage to the semi-finals by heavily defeating South Korea 9-1, and look unstoppable after Saturday’s opening 5-0 win over 2018 silver medallists Canada. The Russian state news agency Tass has confirmed the Russian Paralympic Committee athletes have travelled back to Moscow.

3/6/2022,"Mood (BBC Three/BBC One) | iPlayerPeaky Blinders (BBC One) | iPlayerKilling Eve (BBC One) | iPlayerStoryville: Tango With Putin (BBC Four) | iPlayer Mood, the new BBC Three six-part series created and written by Nicôle Lecky, waits for no TV reviewer. It doesn’t so much start as erupt into a full-blown pop video: the protagonist – aspiring, mixed-race twentysomething singer Sasha (Lecky) – sashays around her east London housing estate wreathed in pink smoke, until the music abruptly stops and all is revealed as mere wish fulfilment. In reality, Sasha is a weed-puffing mess: stalking her ex on social media, setting fire to his garden. Thrown out by her mother and stepfather (Jessica Hynes and Paul Kaye), penniless, sofa surfing, she stays with audacious, magnetic Carly (Lara Peake). Carly shows her the ropes as a cam girl on “DailyFans” (a barely disguised OnlyFans), which escalates to real-world escorting. Thus, one of Mood’s themes is how unsafe young female life can be: how anyone could be Sasha, losing their footing with each bad decision, skidding into darkness. Like Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag and Michaela Coel’s Chewing Gum, Mood began life on stage: as Lecky’s 2019 Royal Court play Superhoe. Though witty, with a bruising bite, it isn’t a comedy. Directed by Dawn Shadforth, it’s an observational drama with many heartbeats; porn, the internet, race, poverty, sexual predation, dreams falling into a death spiral. Along the way (it’s all on iPlayer), there are Lecky’s co-written songs: gospelly ballads in church, rap in a kebab shop, a ska extravaganza in a benefits office. Christ, you think, have I been tricked into watching musical theatre? But the music has a function: illuminating Sasha’s inner and outer worlds. Lecky is a striking writer-performer, showing that incredible generosity I keep seeing in these female-led works, giving other characters their own distinct arcs. Peake, as Carly, wholly embodies the intoxicating dark sparkle of the Bad Friend. Hynes and Kaye are a Mike Leigh movie in their own right. Mood isn’t flawless – the later episodes are a little slack and maudlin – but it works beautifully as a modern lost girl cautionary tale, devoid of preachiness. Peaky Blinders, now world-renowned for making Birmingham cool, returns for its sixth and final series on BBC One. The last time we saw chief Blinder Thomas Shelby, played by Cillian Murphy, his plot to kill Oswald Mosley had failed and he was about to shoot himself; a plan scuppered by his addict brother Arthur (Paul Anderson), who removed the bullets in a rare display of common sense. Tommy must then hold a Romany funeral, a poignant pyre of burning caravan, for slain (by the IRA) gang matriarch Polly Gray, portrayed so vividly by Helen McCrory, who died of cancer last year. Moving forward to 1933, a meeting on the French-Canadian island of Miquelon signals the end of prohibition and Small Heath booze smuggling, ushering in opium, Boston overlords, new problems and bad blood. I now know not to panic when encountering Steven Knight’s pungent, labyrinthine series-opening episodes. All will become clear, and even if it doesn’t, just sit back and enjoy what has evolved into a fully fledged, early 20th-century underworld opera. Directed by Anthony Byrne, Peaky Blinders continues to echo the emotional colour palette (death, gunmetal, paranoia) of Shelby’s first world war past. Murphy persists in portraying Tommy as a visceral one-man death wish, constantly forced to face the existential void with pale staring eyes. Likewise, the script remains all guttural poetry, despite Tommy’s newfound teetotalism: “I now realise that whisky is just fuel for the loud engines inside your head,” he growls, supping a glass of water. Threats are everywhere, not least from Polly’s vengeful son Michael (Finn Cole), whose hatred shivers across his skin. The episode closes with a tribute to McCrory, whose loss is definitely felt: Polly was effectively Tommy’s wing-woman equal, leading with him from the front. Perhaps in an attempt to fill the void, Michael’s wife, Gina, played by Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen’s Gambit), is repositioned centre stage – serpentine, combative – for the Shelby endgame. Still on BBC One, another drama behemoth returns as spy thriller Killing Eve begins its fourth and final outing, headed by new showrunner Laura Neal. Fans of the spectacular first series, adapted by Waller-Bridge, may have, like me, been willing it to return to form ever since. As gentlewoman assassin Villanelle, Jodie Comer blasted on to the criminal sociopath scene with mercurial brio, before morphing into a frankly irritating Bond villain without portfolio. Similarly, Sandra Oh originally gave great “wry everywoman” as Eve, but then transformed into a Villanelle mini-me. Even their mutual obsession started to feel a bit tiring: does the world need panto Sapphic? Have things improved? Not especially. Villanelle, swathed in white robes, continues with her finding God malarkey, while Eve’s new security job seems to mainly involve canoodling with a colleague. Villanelle and Eve exchange banter over a fish tank, but it’s all so profoundly anticlimactic, I find myself looking for the fish. Not even Fiona Shaw’s considerable thespian heft is enough to rescue the main plot, involving some sinister network called the Twelve. Still, it’s funny when Villanelle says grace: “For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make you thank me.” Dare we dream of the old magic returning? BBC Four’s Storyville: Tango With Putin is a timely documentary about Russian television station Dozhd (AKA TV Rain). Conceived as a funky lifestyle channel by socialite owner Natalya Sindeyeva, Dozhd provoked constant governmental ire with its courageous dedication to independent and critical reporting. Originally titled “F@ck This Job” (heard blurted by a reporter at a tumultuous Ukraine demonstration), the film is directed by Vera Krichevskaya, once a producer at the station, who reveals how Dozhd has suffered threats, cyberattacks, evictions, and was last year designated a “foreign agent” by the Kremlin. “Fear ate me alive,” says Sindeyeva, who also suffered breast cancer and saw her marriage collapse. In a brief, sanity-saving respite she is shown learning to tango. Elsewhere in this sobering film, the only sense of dancing is with the devil. It closes with the announcement that, last Tuesday, Dozhd was shut down as part of the Russian crackdown on independent Ukraine coverage.

3/6/2022,"The personal data of dozens of non-British rough sleepers has been shared with the Home Office under a controversial programme that could lead to their deportation. Councils and homelessness charities shared the sensitive details of homeless people 85 times with the Home Office under a scheme critics describe as an attempt to embroil organisations in the government’s “hostile environment” policy. The Home Office will not reveal how many of the people referred to its Rough Sleeping Support Service (RSSS) since October 2020 have been forcibly removed from the UK. According to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates and the Observer, the referrals were made by 11 councils including Gloucester and Leeds, a housing provider called Keystage Housing, and three charities, one of which has since withdrawn from the scheme saying it wanted to avoid putting rough sleepers at risk. The RSSS aims to identify within 24 hours whether an undocumented rough sleeper has an immigration status that allows them to access public funds such as housing support. Anyone found to have no lawful basis to remain in the UK could ultimately face removal, either voluntarily or forcibly. James Tullett, chief executive of charity Ramfel, which supports destitute migrants and does not use the RSSS, said the Home Office’s failure to remove the risk of deportation to users has made it untrustworthy and a “waste of taxpayers’ money”. The scheme was trialled by the Home Office from 2018 until the Observer revealed it as part of a covert strategy to deport rough sleepers after acquiring personal data without their consent. After a legal challenge by the Public Interest Law Centre, it was relaunched in September 2020 with a new requirement to obtain rough sleepers’ “fully informed consent”. However, experts questioned whether fully informed consent was possible, given the potential vulnerabilities of rough sleepers, possible language barriers and a power imbalance between them and the organisations contracted to help them. Josephine Whitaker-Yilmaz of migrant charity Praxis, which has not used the service, said: “Our main concern is that sharing our clients’ data with the Home Office through the RSSS in its current form puts them at increased risk of detention and deportation, and this risk outweighs any benefit that the service may have.” A freedom of information request prompted councils and charities to reveal that 49 of the rough sleepers referred had not been deported, yet what happened to the remaining 36 people remains unknown. Keystage Housing, Luton council’s homelessness partner, made the most referrals, 28, with a spokesperson saying there was “no instances of removal or deportation from the UK”. The number of rough sleepers using the RSSS appears to have fallen short of expectations within the Home Office, which is conducting a review into the scheme that is expected to be published this month. In a letter dated 19 November 2021 inviting stakeholders to feed back, officials admit that “participation in the [service] has been low”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We remain committed to the RSSS to help get people off the streets, which has been an open and transparent service throughout. “The public expects those with no right to be here and who make no effort to legalise their status to be removed – either voluntarily or enforced.”",News/Society,Non-British rough sleepers ‘targeted for deportation’ by Home Office support scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/06/non-british-rough-sleepers-targeted-for-deportation-by-home-office-support-scheme
3/6/2022,"We noticed the boy was a bit poorly when he started neglecting his Boney M. We’ve been singing Daddy Cool in the mornings for a while now, which he adores for its soaring strings, doggerel lyrics and the preposterously overblown production familiar to all 1976 pop hits. Personally, I love it for its central message that I, his daddy, am cool. It’s a message he wholeheartedly supports, or at the very least, tacitly endorses, by shouting, ‘DADDDDDY… DADDDDY COOOOOOL’ at the top of his lungs. And yet here he sat; sullen, withdrawn, unable to muster his usual enthusiasm, which was suspicious as I’d been particularly cool that morning. On closer inspection, we noticed his eye was oozing a fine trail of goop, the sort of sleep-build up that could trap a calf in a ditch. My son says he has snot in his eyes, leading us to begin correcting him and then, for the thousandth time, realise we’re not sure if he’s wrong. ‘Is it just snot?’ I say, under my breath. ‘No,’ my wife says, ‘it’s, like, eye stuff – water, or pus or something.’ Seeing we were quite clearly out of our depth, I consulted the experts. A quick Google informed me that a) searching for ‘sleep’ is quite difficult, and that b) Americans do indeed call sleep ‘eye boogers’, which is the sort of winning shorthand you only get from a deeply unpretentious country. Pro tip: the technical term for easy searching is ‘rheum’ which, like fried oysters, or the actor Billy Bob Thornton, is classier than most alternatives, but still somehow off-putting. It turns out all three of us are right, as rheum is, in fact, just mucus discharged from your cornea or the little inlets above and below the eyeball, termed the conjunctivae. And then a dim gong of understanding. ‘Conjunctiva, as in conjunctivitis,’ I say, very much like a medical doctor. Wiping the matted rheum from his eye and cheek, now brittle and hard like Shredded Wheat, we look again and see it’s moderately swollen. I run to the chemist and grab some Brolene, the eye drops with a much-vaunted efficacy for dealing with swelling, and whose tradename is important for me to record here since it gave us the opportunity to sing it to the tune of Jolene by Dolly Parton, in the hopes of making the process slightly less traumatic for a bemused toddler. The problem with administering medicine of any kind to a three-year-old is they have no idea that you’re trying to help them. From their point of view, their most trusted adult has gone mad and decided to squirt liquid in their stupid, stingy eyes for no good reason. Luckily Dolly Parton did her bit, and we cajoled him into singing Brolene with us as the deed was done; him crying all the while, but powerless to resist the plaintive, if unlikely, tale of a woman so impossibly alluring that Dolly’s only chance of evading cuckoldry was to plead to her directly through song. There he sat, crying big goopy tears before he asked for his favourite song to be played instead. Arms folded, sniffling slighty, he refused to dance. ‘Daddy NOT cool,’ he said instead, as we bopped beside him regardless.

3/6/2022,"Alison Clarkson, AKA Betty Boo, 52, grew up in west London with her Scottish mother, Malaysian father and brother. At 17, she ran away to New York with her rap trio, the She Rockers, and by 21 she had three Top 10 singles and a platinum debut album, Boomania. At 24, Madonna offered to sign her to her label, Maverick Records, but Clarkson quit performing instead. Later, she co-wrote Hear’Say’s Pure and Simple and worked with Girls Aloud, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Blur’s Alex James. Now living in Wiltshire with film producer husband, Paul Toogood, she has just released her first solo single in 29 years, Get Me to the Weekend. An album follows this summer. The Boo is back. Why now?It suddenly dawned on me a few years ago that I was going to be 50 and deep down I always wanted to make another Betty Boo record. Getting into middle age, you also start to feel invisible and I didn’t want that to happen. If it’s OK for Mick Jagger or Rick Astley to keep going, why not me? So you started writing again?Yes, in the supermarket car park in the first lockdown. My husband would do the shopping and I’d park facing a wall, playing tracks, so no one could see me singing along [laughs]. It was great to enjoy it again because I’ve had times when I didn’t even listen to music through the years. It made me too sad. Now I think I’ve made the record I should have made when I was 25. What made you give up your pop career at the end of the 90s?My mother got very ill, then she died, then my aunt died 10 months after my mum. My dad had died before that. To be a pop star, you have to be full-whack all the time and I just melted. I didn’t want to be that other person any more. I went into survival mode looking after my granny and family. But I didn’t feel like I’d missed out, because when I launched my solo career, I’d taken control of everything – written my music, produced it, had the freedom to look the way I wanted to look. A major label would have reined me in, told me what to do. Not me! Is it different being a woman in pop now?As an older woman, I find the first thing people say is “what does she look like now?”. A few years ago, I went to the premiere of Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, as I helped the writer, Dan Gillespie Sells, on a rap section when it was in development. A photographer spotted me outside the 7/11 in Piccadilly and took a picture of me from below, up my nose, and that’s the one online the next day, with the writer saying: oh, she looks so different to how she used to. Of course I did, because that was 30 years ago! I talked to Bananarama about it – it drives us all mad. The name Betty Boo was inspired not only by Betty Boop, but also by your grandmother, Betty Clarkson, a leftwing activist. Was politics around in your childhood?Yes. I worked for the Fabian Society in the school and summer holidays and my granny dragged me along to all kinds of meetings. She also set up a drop-in centre for older people in White City and was always campaigning for people, such as a man wrongly accused of stabbing someone at the Notting Hill carnival; she campaigned to have him released from prison. She had amazing energy and was so well respected that she had her retirement party at the House of Lords. I remember meeting Arthur Scargill and a young Tony Blair – all the up-and-coming New Labour politicians were in awe of her. I have so much to thank her for. You broke through as a rapper with the Beatmasters in 1989, with your take on Martha Reeves and the Vandellas’ I Can’t Dance to That Music You’re Playing. What drew you to rap?It wasn’t just rap: it was all of hip-hop culture, the music, the creativity. Some musicians learn the Beatles songbook – I learned Big Daddy Kane’s raps. I loved playing with language and humour, changing my voice, recording myself with my microphone plugged into my hi-fi. It was accessible, like punk. Then I studied sound engineering after I left school – I wanted to be a vet, but the careers adviser said I should be a secretary. I made all these songs in my bedroom instead. There’s a pre-fame clip online of you rapping with members of Public Enemy in the Shepherd’s Bush McDonald’s. How did that happen?It was November 1987 – they’d just played this big Def Jam night at the Hammersmith Odeon with the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Run-DMC. On our walk home, we saw them through the window of McDonald’s – we’d seen them on stage doing all these military kind of routines, with Uzis – how on earth we went up to them and weren’t scared, I don’t know. I had my hi-tops and my nan’s cardigan on as I had a cold, and they filmed us rapping. Then we got invited to New York and I didn’t tell my mum where I was going. It was really naughty. Then my brother heard a DJ on BBC Radio London talking about this girl he’d seen rapping in Harlem. “Mum! I know exactly where Alison is!” Your retro space age look became a template for 1990s fashion. Indeed, when the Spice Girls were being put together, the original manager, Chris Herbert, put out an advert looking for “five Betty Boos”…I worked with Chris on his new band, Girl Thing, a few years later and he told me about the advert. At first I was, “Oh, thanks for nicking all my ideas!” But it’s amazing what they achieved. The look came from my love of glam rock and Ziggy Stardust as a tiny kid watching Top of the Pops, wanting to do fancy dress every day in silver pants and big boots. One of your songs for Girl Thing, Pure and Simple, became a million-seller for Hear’Say, the first 21st-century ITV pop contest winners. How was that experience?I only knew about Pure and Simple being used after Hear’Say had won. The presenter said: “If you want to hear Hear’Say’s debut single, call 0800-whatever, and here’s what it’s called” – and I thought, oh, and called the number. It had been out already on a Japanese export, so no one had heard it in this country, but Pete Waterman had produced it and loved it and obviously kept it in mind. I dipped in and out of songwriting. I often found it a bit soul-destroying. I’ve worked with some really big producers in LA who’d turn up at 10.30am and have a finished record by five o’clock. I found that too much pressure – and some would do four sessions a day, spreading stuff thinly. I prefer dipping in and out of things for fun. Get Me to the Weekend samples Human League’s Love Action, a song that your dad loved. You obviously still love sampling.I still love bringing together retro things and making them sound modern. It’s a continuation of where I began – Doin’ the Do sped up Reparata and the Delrons’ Captain of Your Ship, after all. I’ve also been doing more stuff with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, David Gray and an exciting rap legend who I can’t mention yet. I’m enjoying myself. What does Doin’ the Do [the title of her 1990 hit] mean to you now?It’s even more relevant to me now in my 50s than it was in my teens and 20s. It’s about taking control of your life again and fulfilling your ambitions in your own way. These days, you can generate your own fans and people can engage with you directly online and I love that. I’m not doing this for anyone else. I’m doing it for me and them!

3/6/2022,"Elections are often a choice of maintaining the status quo or voting for change – but does it matter whether the incumbent or insurgent wins? Yes, concludes a fascinating new study of thousands of national elections since 1945. The researchers find in close elections that turnovers (when the incumbent leader or party loses) improve a country’s economic (GDP, inflation and unemployment) and wider performance (trade, peace and human development). The positive effects are bigger in presidential systems and poorer countries. Electoral turnovers also lead to less corruption, which is always nice. I’m afraid the paper is silent on whether it leads to fewer parties in Downing Street or other seats of power. Before Labour get all excited, it’s worth noting that the effect is not down to whether the winners were left- or rightwing. What’s going on is that newly elected leaders are more likely to get things done. They put more effort in because they’ve got more to prove reputationally. Sounds to me like a pretty good argument for democracy, which at one level is basically defined as election-driven turnovers of leadership actually happening. The flipside to the positive benefits of electoral turnovers is that presumably the performance bar that insurgents are jumping over must be pretty low. So, lots to chew on for political parties and voters in wannabe or established democracies around the world. The good news is that turnovers have become more common since the early 1990s, now making up 40% of results. The bad news is that that hasn’t been the case in Russia, where some turnover, electoral or otherwise, would have helped a long time ago.
