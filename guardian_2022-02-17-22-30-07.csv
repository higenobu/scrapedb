2/17/2022,"The Dutch state condoned and concealed a systematic use of extreme violence such as extrajudicial executions and torture during the 1945-9 Indonesian war of independence against colonial rule, a government-backed inquiry has concluded. The ruthless brutality of the Netherlands’ military and intelligence services is said to have been sanctioned at the highest levels of government, with all considerations subordinated to the goal of maintaining the colony.  The Dutch government’s position, held since an inquiry in 1969 concluded that there had only been isolated “excesses” and that the armed forces “on the whole” had behaved correctly, is condemned as “untenable”. Dr Rémy Limpach, one of the historians involved in the research, said that part of the explanation of the conduct of the Dutch, which had amounted at times to a “reign of terror”, was its weakness in the face of guerrilla tactics. “Often it follows from a feeling of powerlessness, frustration, feeling that you have got your back against the wall,” Limpach said. “Not being able to handle the conflict with normal military means.” The government-funded research, undertaken over four and a half years, offers a challenging perspective on a period of history that remains raw to many in the Netherlands, where the country’s colonial record is fiercely contested. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is expected to comment on the findings later on Thursday. On 17 August 1945, two days after Japan’s surrender brought an end to the second world war, Indonesian revolutionaries Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared independence, breaking with 350 years of Dutch exploitation. The government in The Hague rejected the move and between the independence declaration and the withdrawal of Dutch forces on 27 December 1949 an estimated 100,000 Indonesians were killed, compared to about 5,300 fighting on the Dutch side, including Indonesians in their service. “The sources show that the use of extreme violence by the Dutch armed forces was not only widespread, but often deliberate, too,” the Dutch and Indonesian researchers wrote. “It was condoned at every level: political, military and legal. The reason for this was that the Netherlands wanted to defeat the Republic of Indonesia – which had declared independence on 17 August 1945 – at any cost, and was prepared to subordinate almost everything to this goal. In doing so, ethical boundaries, including those that applied at the time, were emphatically crossed.” The army was “frequently and structurally” guilty of “extrajudicial executions, ill-treatment and torture, detention under inhumane conditions, arson of houses and villages, and often arbitrary mass arrests and internments”, the report’s researchers said. Rape was not normally condoned but it was lightly punished, if at all. A spokesman for the Veterans Platform, an organisation representing former Dutch military personnel, claimed the research had underplayed the violence unleashed by those fighting for independence. He said: “The decolonisation period has been too emphatically examined from the perspective of contemporary norms, values ​​and ethical considerations. Unfortunately, more than 200,000 veterans are implicitly portrayed as extreme perpetrators of violence and they and their relatives are insulted and stigmatised.” An organisation said to represent Indo-Dutch people, Platform 2.0, had appealed to the courts to block the report’s publication. The research, conducted by the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, the Netherlands Institute of Military History and the Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, will be published in 14 books, including a summary volume, Beyond the Pale: Dutch Extreme Violence in the Indonesian War of Independence, 1945-1949. The Dutch king, Willem-Alexander, apologised in 2020 for the “excessive violence” inflicted on Indonesia during his country’s colonial rule, the first admission of regret since independence.",News/World news,"Dutch state condoned extreme violence in Indonesian war, inquiry concludes",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/dutch-state-condoned-extreme-violence-in-indonesian-war-inquiry-concludes
2/17/2022,"Consumers face paying more for popular products including confectionery, cleaning products and over-the-counter medicines, after more firms including the KitKat-maker Nestlé said they would put up their prices this year amid rising costs. Nestlé, which also makes Nespresso coffee pods, Häagen-Dazs ice-cream and Purina pet food, said it expected its costs to increase further this year and would pass some of the rise on to consumers.  The Swiss food group increased its prices throughout 2021 to 3.1% in the final three months of the year, and said it intended to protect its profit margins. “It is a safe assumption that our input cost increases for 2022 will be higher than 2021, that is something that we have to reflect in our pricing,” said Mark Schneider, its chief executive, on Thursday. “There is almost no place in the company that is exempt of inflation now ... Some of these things you can hedge against, some not.” Nestle reported 7.5% organic growth for 2021, which was higher than forecast, that included 2% growth arising from price increases. Britain’s households are suffering from squeeze on their earnings, as the price of goods and services – from food to energy bills to TV and broadband contracts – is rising. The UK’s inflation rate hit 5.5% in January, the highest annual jump in the cost of living in almost 30 years. According to official figures, more than three-quarters of UK adults (76%) reported that their cost of living had increased over the last month, a rise of seven percentage points from late January. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said increasing food shop prices was the most-frequently reported reason for the cost of living crunch (90%), followed by rising energy bills (77%) and increases in the price of fuel (69%). The consumer goods company Reckitt, the make of brands such as Dettol, Nurofen and Strepsils, said on Thursday that its costs increased on average by 11% during 2021. It predicted these would climb even higher this year. The Berkshire-based firm, which was formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, said it was absorbing some of its increased costs, but was increasing prices of some of its products. “We are passing some pricing on to consumers, but we minimise that through programmes that we have internally such as productivity programmes,” said Jeff Carr, its chief financial officer. “Prices have gone up but we’re absorbing a significant part of that inflation, and we’re not passing it on to consumers. We want to get good offers to our consumers, we want to be competitive.” Reckitt said it was seeing “across the board” increases in the price of raw materials, especially those related to crude oil such as plastics, as well as tinplate – used for making tin cans – and dairy products. The company added that it had also been facing continued supply chain disruption and higher transport costs. “Logistics has been a key challenge, not just for us, but for everyone, and that’s been strong double digits, an over 20% increase in in logistical costs, ocean freight being one of the key drivers of that,” Carr said.",News/Business,Nestlé joins other firms in warning further price rises are in store,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/nestle-joins-other-firms-in-warning-further-price-rises-kitkat
2/17/2022,"Tensions in the east of Ukraine have risen dramatically after Russian-backed separatists opened fire across the line of control with Ukrainian forces, hitting a nursery school and injuring three people. According to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) there were “multiple shelling incidents” on Thursday morning across the frontline in the Donbas region.  The attack on the city of Stanytsia Luhanska blew a hole through the wall of kindergarten number 21. Classes had begun when the building in Depovska Street was reportedly hit by a shell. Video showed debris and masonry strewn over a play area. The pupils were in another room when the missile hit, but a teacher, laundry worker and security guard were left with concussion, according to reports. The Ukrainian military said 32 shells landed on the city, also injuring a serviceman and disrupting electricity supplies. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Russian side of “provocative shelling” at a time when the US president, Joe Biden, had warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine remained “distinctly possible”. The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said he was “concerned that Russia is trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine”. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, echoed this. “Reports of alleged abnormal military activity by Ukraine in Donbas are a blatant attempt by the Russian government to fabricate pretexts for invasion,” she tweeted. “This is straight out of the Kremlin playbook.” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: “Civilian infrastructure damaged. We call on all partners to swiftly condemn this severe violation of Minsk agreements by Russia amid an already tense security situation.” Maria Mezentseva, a Ukrainian MP, said: “I see it as a further provocation because the previous ones didn’t work. We see them going after social infrastructure. The idea is to provoke the Ukrainian side into a reaction.” The OSCE logs regular firing between Moscow-armed separatists and Ukrainian soldiers. In recent months this low-level conflict has been relatively calm as Russia has moved 150,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders, and Ukrainian soldiers have been under instruction not to return fire. Russia, for its part, has accused Kyiv of trying to provoke an escalation to recapture rebel territory by force. It says Ukraine is guilty of genocide, which Ukraine strongly denies. The Kremlin said on Thursday it was deeply concerned by the flare-up in violence in eastern Ukraine and hoped that the west would use its influence on Kyiv to prevent further escalation. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed reports of a planned invasion by Russia but said Moscow was watching the situation closely. He said Russia had started pulling back some of its troops that had completed drills in areas adjacent to Ukraine, but that the process would take time. Putin’s intentions remain unclear, after inaccurate predictions by Washington that an invasion might begin on Wednesday. Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, said some Russian equipment and ammunition would remain in his country once joint military exercises with Russia, taking place next to Ukraine, concluded at the weekend. The US, UK, and Stoltenberg have all expressed deep scepticism that Russia is pulling its forces out. The Kremlin said time was needed for troops to return to their bases, saying it took weeks for them to deploy for military drills. On Wednesday, the Russian Duma asked Putin to recognise the two separatist political entities in the Donbas – the Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics – as independent states. The Kremlin has not decided how to respond. Formal recognition would dramatically raise tensions and kill off the Minsk agreement, signed by Kyiv and Moscow in 2015. Russia has repeatedly accused Zelenskiy’s pro-western government of failing to implement the accords. On Thursday, the Luhansk people’s republic claimed it had come under repeated attack. Ukrainian forces had used mortars, grenade launchers and a machine gun in four separate incidents on Thursday, it asserted. “Armed forces of Ukraine have crudely violated the ceasefire regime, using heavy weapons, which, according to the Minsk agreements, should be withdrawn,” the separatists said in a statement. Ukraine’s military denied the claim and said “Russian occupation troops” had cynically targeted civilians. “As a result of the use of heavy artillery weapons by terrorists, shells hit the kindergarten building. Two civilians received shell shock,” it said. The Guardian has seen video apparently showing shelling by separatists against the frontline city of Hirske, controlled by Ukraine, in Luhansk Oblast. A series of percussive booms can be heard.

2/17/2022,"Amazon will continue to accept Visa credit card payments across its sites after the companies struck a new global deal. The move comes months after the online retailer threatened to stop the use of UK-issued Visa credit cards due to the fees charged to process payments.  Amazonsaid the fees were “an obstacle” to providing the best prices for its customers, while Visa accused Amazon of restricting customer choice. However, the two businesses have since reached an agreement, ending weeks of negotiations. A Visa spokesperson said: “Visa is pleased to have reached a broad, global agreement with Amazon. This agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today, as well as a joint commitment to collaboration on new product and technology initiatives to ensure innovative payment experiences for our customers in the future.” Amazon said: “We’ve recently reached a global agreement with Visa that allows all customers to continue using their Visa credit cards in our stores. Amazon remains committed to offering customers a payment experience that is convenient and offers choice.” Amazon customers in Australia and Singapore previously had to pay a surcharge when purchasing items using a Visa credit card. This has also been removed. The furore followed the removal of an EU cap on fees charged by card issuers in the UK after Brexit. Visa increased the charge of the value of a transaction for credit card payments made online between the UK and the EU to 1.5%, from a previous charge of 0.3%. The companies have not disclosed how much Amazon pays for processing. In an email to users of the site in November, Amazon blamed the cost of processing the payments: “Starting 19 January 2022, we will unfortunately no longer accept Visa credit cards issued in the UK, due to the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions.” The consumer group Which? welcomed the news that UK customers could continue to use Visa credit cards on the site. Ele Clark, a senior editor at Which? Money, said: “Using a credit card to pay offers shoppers valuable legal protections that debit cards cannot, and removing this option for Visa cardholders would have meant fewer rights for millions of consumers. “However, there have been longstanding concerns about credit card fees, and this affects customers and businesses. The regulator must urgently take forward its proposals to examine whether card fees are fair and what impact this will have on competition.” The Payment Systems Regulator launched a review into card fees in 2021 and found that they had “increased significantly” since the EU cap was lifted. It is considering whether action needs to be taken on the issue. “We have always said that if we see an issue with fees that required attention outside the scope of our market review, we would consider what action we should take,” the regulator said in November . Meanwhile, the British Retail Consortium said companies faced an estimated £150m increase in the cost of accepting cross-border card payments. British retailers were subject to an extra £36.5m in fees, equivalent to £100,000 every day.",News/Technology,Amazon and Visa resolve dispute over credit card fees,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/17/amazon-visa-resolve-credit-card-dispute-global-deal-payments
2/17/2022,"Teachers and pupils in England have complained about inconsistencies in the advance information made available to help focus their revision before the summer GCSEs and A-levels, describing it in some cases as “virtually useless”. School leaders said the information published by exam boards last week about what topics students will be tested on across 300 GCSE, AS and A-level specifications was hugely varied, with modern foreign languages a source of particular concern.  MFL teachers have spoken out on social media and written to exam boards expressing disappointment at the advance information for the MFL writing papers. One teacher wrote to the AQA exam board: “What is going on? This information is virtually useless, it reads like the contents page of the textbook – ie, virtually every topic is included for Spanish, and most for French. For some reason, though, German has had more material removed. “Could you explain how exactly I am meant to present this to students who are already stressed by the whole exam process, having missed significant portions of their schooling?” Others have raised concerns about discrepancies in the advance information provided by different exam boards for A-level economics. One student wrote on the Student Room that AQA listed almost the entire specification, while OCR provided a concise list of topics, saying: “This is simply unfair.” The advance information is one of a number of measures put in place this year to try to ensure the fairness of exams, which are returning after being cancelled for two years. Other adaptations include a choice of topics in some GCSEs, such as English literature and history, and exam support materials, including formula sheets in maths. Students have been told that examiners will be more generous when setting grade boundaries to provide a safety net, but parents and teachers say the measures cannot fairly compensate for widely varying experiences of learning loss during the pandemic. A poll of 2,900 teachers by Teacher Tapp found widespread unhappiness with the advance information. In relation to GCSE languages, nearly three-quarters of those who took part in the poll were dissatisfied – 55% “very dissatisfied”, and 19% “dissatisfied”. More than two out of five GCSE English teachers (43%) were dissatisfied, compared with the one in five who were satisfied. GCSE maths teachers were the most enthusiastic, with 47% satisfied with the advance information provided for their subject, while two out of five science teachers expressed satisfaction. One headteacher from Greater Manchester said some of his subject leads had said the advance information was helpful, but others were worried about the impact of exams on the most disadvantaged children, the large volume of knowledge still to be covered, and inconsistencies in the level of adjustments across subjects. He said: “Several subject heads were questioning why, after so much time and so much build-up, the adjustments are so insignificant.” There were also fears the adjustments could compound unfairness. “Changes may well further advantage the more advantaged by reducing content and making revision more focused, but may also disadvantage those worst affected by the pandemic because changes do not go far enough,” the headteacher said. A Guardian callout prompted responses from parents and pupils who were also worried about the fairness of this year’s exams. “Exams should be cancelled and we should trust teachers to give teacher-assessed grades, as they know their students best,” said one A-level student. “The advance information does not compensate for the disruption to education and there are many discrepancies between subjects and exam boards, therefore cancelling A-levels is the only fair alternative.” Steve Chalke, the founder of the Oasis Academy Trust, said his staff were still working their way through the detail of the advance information. “There’s a lot to digest. Some were saying, ‘There’s lots here’, others were saying, ‘There’s not very much in my subject’.” He also expressed concern about students’ mental health, with some struggling to get out of bed because of anxiety. “The level of nervousness is huge, among staff, parents and pupils.” One teacher of French and Spanish in a comprehensive school in south-west England said her GCSE students were “flabbergasted” to find that just one out of 12 topics had been dropped in Spanish GCSE, while German students were told they would be tested on around half the normal list of topics. She and other MFL teachers were also disappointed to see the holiday topic in French – usually very popular with students – dropped. “They are working their socks off but they are stressed. Some of them are working too hard, some of them are shutting down,” she said. “Some of them I haven’t seen since Christmas.” The exams regulator, Ofqual, has been approached for comment.",News/Education,Students and teachers in England decry ‘virtually useless’ exam previews,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/17/students-teachers-england-decry-exam-previews
2/17/2022,"Scotland Yard has been forced to admit it was “unacceptable” for one of its official Twitter accounts to apparently criticise the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, leading him to accuse the force of amplifying misleading information. Khan tackled the suggestion – made in a now-deleted tweet by the verified “Met Police Taskforce” – that he did not understand the rules for disciplining officers.  It came as the London mayor said he would not support the choice of the home secretary, Priti Patel, to replace the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, unless whoever was chosen understood “the importance of addressing these deep cultural issues” within the force, such as racism, sexism and bullying. The shock announcement of Dick’s departure has caused turmoil in the Met and for political leaders, including Khan, in whom the Police Federation has declared it has “no confidence”. Tensions escalated further on Thursday when the Times reported that Dick told colleagues Khan had given her an ultimatum to sack senior officers in Charing Cross police station or face suspension herself. Khan insisted during a phone-in on LBC: “It is not the case the commissioner was given an ultimatum to sack them or be sacked.” However, he said he was “angered and disgusted” by the views of some officers at Charing Cross station and “concerned about the impact on trust and confidence” after it was revealed they exchanged WhatsApp messages about hitting and raping women, as well as the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. Khan criticised a tweet by an official Met account which retweeted a post pointing out that the process for sacking officers is independent of chief constables, with the comment: “Exactly this.” Several hours after the post was deleted, a spokesperson for the Met said the tweet was “unacceptable and shouldn’t have been shared” from an official account. They said senior officers were “addressing the matter” and would remind colleagues “they are expected to be independent and impartial at all times, on and off duty, including on social media”. The mayor suggested the intervention was unhelpful, referring to a recommendation by the Independent Office of Police Conduct that found widespread evidence of bullying and discrimination among officers. Khan said: “When you have Met police accounts amplifying information that is misleading, how is it possible for officers concerned about behaviour of other officers to come forward? “Why are we surprised when whistleblowers don’t come forward if this is the attitude both the IOPC talked about and you’ve exemplified in relation to a blue-ticked account?” With the search for Dick’s replacement now under way, Khan said he believed Patel would be “incredibly professional” in the recruitment process. However, he said that while he hoped to be consulted, he would not support Dick’s successor if “I don’t have confidence that he or she understands the importance of addressing these deep cultural issues”. Khan also resisted any suggestion he should lean on police to encourage the Met to publish photos of Downing Street parties, which the Guardian revealed earlier this week the government expected Scotland Yard would not release. “Just think how inappropriate it would be for me, a Labour mayor, getting involved in operational matters where a Conservative politician is being investigated,” he said. “There are some countries around the world where the police do have their arms twisted in relation to operational issues. I think it is right in our system where I have got no influence in relation to whether the police do investigate Boris Johnson, what is published and so forth. “I have always, as the mayor, been cognisant of the importance of me understanding which side of the line I should be on.”",News/UK news,Met police admit tweet critical of Sadiq Khan was unacceptable,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/met-police-admit-tweet-critical-of-sadiq-khan-was-unacceptable

We’re not dissimilar to look at – we’re quite short and quite petite. She had an impression of me that I didn’t live up to. In a good way. Emma We shared a selection of dips and kalamata olives. Then I had a roasted tomato and lentil salad. It was one of those meals where rocket’s coming out of your mouth. She was quite a posh, dainty young lady and I was spraying her with salad. Louise I had some kind of aubergine, Asian dish. It was delicious. My objective was to show that you could have dinner with someone who was – quote unquote – a Tory and voted Brexit, and they weren’t the worst person on earth. Emma I thought she was lovely, but I feel like she lives in a naive bubble. A tiny little village, surrounded by similar people, all wealthy. I wonder if she doesn’t see the impact of what Brexit has done to people. Louise My main point is that people are massively pro- or massively anti-Boris, and there’s no space in the middle. I object to him being compared to Trump. Emma I nearly laughed out loud at the Boris Johnson conversation. She said Johnson was a go-getter who gets things done. I said, “Tell me one thing that Boris has achieved.” She mentioned something about national insurance raises, but didn’t justify why that was a serious achievement, or indeed, any achievement. Louise I’m not sure that NI was the right way to raise the tax. I don’t think it’s a terrible idea; it’s a broad-based tax. But his leadership around Brexit was good and important. The things we feared – millions of job losses, the hit to the economy itself – these have not materialised. There are friction costs, the challenges to small businesses of exporting to Europe, the red tape, the queues; these are fair concerns. The question is, are they greater than the sovereignty issue? Emma Anyone who’s got here and doesn’t realise that everything that comes out of that man’s mouth is a lie – what can you say? If we’d started listing the ways in which he’s untrustworthy, we never would have concluded that conversation. Louise We both have personal experience of trans issues, and we landed in a not too dissimilar position. Emma We talked about self-identification, and what some people see as the potential danger to women. My feeling is that we’re actually not talking about trans people being a danger to women – it’s just men, isn’t it? It’s this obsession with the evil penis that gets people worried, but trans people are more marginalised and likely to be in danger from the same men who are a threat to women. Louise I’m intrigued by what she said about tomboys – that a girl who was a tomboy would choose another label. I was saying: what is society saying about what it is to be a girl that is making her feel like that? Emma Where we fell down was on mask wearing. She’s a bit worried that we will end up being like a far eastern country where people wear masks just to leave the house. Louise There are lots of questions around whether they’re needed with a vaccinated population. I don’t think they’re cost-free, which I think she agreed with. Emma If anything good has come out of Covid, I hope it’s a more responsible attitude to other people’s health. Louise It felt like we agreed on quite a lot. She may have been thinking, “She’s talking a load of rubbish.” Emma I feel I just talked at her. I don’t think either of us changed our opinions, but we found unexpected common ground.
