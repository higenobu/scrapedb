2/15/2022,"John Marion Grant was the first death row inmate to be executed in Oklahoma in over six years. He convulsed and vomited for 15 minutes during the lethal injection procedure. Grant's autopsy reveals that his death was similar to someone who had been asphyxiated. An autopsy released this month states that Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol, used to put John Marion Grant to death, caused ""heavy lungs"" — a finding that comes after witnesses described Grant violently convulsing after the regimen was administered. The February 7 report said that Grant's lungs weighed 1,390 grams, compared to the standard weight of approximately 1000 grams, and contained ""edema, congestion, and mild emphysematous changes."" Dr. Mark Edgar, a pathologist, told KOKH in 2020 that ""severe pulmonary edema"" — as seein in those put to death using the state's the three-drug lethal injection procedure — would cause inmates to ""be aware of sensations of drowning, asphyxia, and terror."" Grant's autopsy also revealed an intramuscular hemorrhage of the tongue. That's seen mostly ""in cases with causes of death including fire fatality, drowning, and asphyxiation compared to those with other causes of death,"" according to a 2018 study in the Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine The autopsy added that there were remnants of vomit in Grant's nasal cavity and mouth. Oklahoma executed Grant on October 28, 2021, with a three-drug lethal injection protocol that caused him to vomit and convulse for 15 minutes. Dan Snyder, a KOKH anchor who attended Grant's execution, said that, ""Almost immediately after the drug was administered, Grant began convulsing, so much so that his entire upper back repeatedly lifted off the gurney."" Medical Examiner Investigation by Colleen Welcher Grant, 60 at the time of his death, was sentenced to die in 1999 after fatally stabbing prison cafeteria worker Gay Carter 16 times while serving a 130-year sentence for armed robberies. Grant's execution was the first since Oklahoma lifted a moratorium on capital punishment prompted by the botched lethal injections of deceased death row inmates Clayton Lockett in 2014 and Charles Warner in 2015. Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol is highly controversial; two inmates recently requested death by firing squad instead. Critics of the three-drug lethal injection protocol question its constitutionality and say it causes ""severe pain and needless suffering,"" according to NPR. Twenty-six inmates are challenging the three-drug lethal injection protocol in a federal trial that begins February 28. In the meantime, Oklahoma has pushed ahead with executions — including Donald Grant, unrelated to John Grant, who was put to death despite suffering from severe mental illness. Death row inmate Gilbert Postelle is next to be executed with a February 17 date.

2/15/2022,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a “day of unity” for February 16, the date that US intelligence reportedly cited for a potential Russian invasion. In a video statement released on Monday, Zelensky also called on Ukraine’s business and political elite to remain in the country, saying it was their “direct duty in such a situation to be with us, with the Ukrainian people.” According to recent local reports, a number of well-heeled Ukrainians have left the country via chartered flights and private jets. “Return to your people and to your country, which was the source of your factories and fortunes,” Zelensky said. According to media reports, American officials, including President Joe Biden, told allies late last week that an invasion of Ukraine by Russia could begin from February 16. “We have been told that February 16 will be the day of the attack, but we will make it the day of unity,” Zelensky said in his video address on Monday. Aides to the president later clarified that Zelensky was referencing those press reports rather than confirming the date itself. US officials now estimate that Russia has massed more than 130,000 troops near the border with Ukraine, both within Russia and also in Belarus. United States Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced on Monday that State Department was in the process of “temporarily relocating” the American embassy in Kyiv to the western city of Lviv “due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces.” Credit: Volodymyr Zelenskiy via Storyful",Politics/Storyful,Ukraine President Calls for 'Day of Unity' as Russian Threat Looms,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-president-calls-day-unity-002805345.html
2/15/2022,"Warning: This article contains descriptions of violence some readers may find disturbing.

A man has been charged in connection with a vicious attack that left a 23-year-old Thai model with a bloodied face in New York City last November.

The incident, which was caught on surveillance video, occurred on the 34th Street-Herald Square subway platform at around 4 a.m. on Nov. 22.

The victim, Bew Jirajariyawetch, was waiting for a train home when someone grabbed her from behind, dragged her along the platform, punched her in the face and took off with her wallet.

The attack left Jirajariyawetch “unquestionably traumatized” and suffering from “persistent nightmares,” her attorney Eric Parnes told the Daily Mail.

Jirajariyawetch, who had moved from Thailand to New York to study English and pursue a modeling career, said she was “lucky to be alive” after the incident.

On Saturday, police announced that they had charged 40-year-old Kevin Douglas with second-degree robbery, third-degree robbery and second-degree assault in connection with the attack as of last Thursday.

Douglas, however, has been in police custody since Nov. 22, when he was arrested just hours after he allegedly attacked Jirajariyawetch — for a separate crime he allegedly committed in Jamaica. Police were only able to connect him with the subway incident last week.

Records show Douglas has been arrested 44 times for crimes dating back to 1977. He was even arrested a record 16 time in a single day on May 13, 2019, according to the New York Post.
  1/4  This portrait was hard to get through and I have debated even posting it. But I feel that Bew Jirajariyawetch’s story needs to be amplified in the wake of these subway attacks. pic.twitter.com/XOqmoon5w3  — Jonathan D. Chang 張敦翔 (@jdschang) January 23, 2022    Douglas remains behind bars on a $75,000 bail. He will return to court on April 11.  The news of the arrest brought a sense of relief to Jirajariyawetch, who told the New York Post, “Nothing can change what happened to me but I am happy to know he can not do this to someone else.”  Featured Image via New York Police Department Enjoy this content?
